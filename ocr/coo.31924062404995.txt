PROFESSOR CHARLES E. GREENE.
Among those who have been foremost in building up our several
departments of instruction, and increasing the usefulness and reputa-
tion of the University, is the distinguished gentleman who is just now
closing his sixteenth year of eminent service as Professor of Civil
Engineering. Though his name stands sixth on our present roll of
seventy-five officers of instruction, he is still in point of age to be classed
among our younger Professors.
Charles E. Greene was born in Cambridge, Mass., February 12,1842.
Growing up under the shadow of Harvard, he naturally resorted to
that institution for his collegiate education. He entered there in 1858,
after pursuing the preparatory studies for a time at the Cambridge
High School, and afterwards at Phillips Exeter Academy. He was
graduated A. B. at Harvard in 1862, and immediately engaged in the
business of manufacturing breech-loading rifles. He gave up this in
the early part of 1864 to enter the military service of the Union as a
volunteer. His first position was that of Quartermaster's Clerk at
Camp Meigs, a camp of rendezvous established at Readville, Mass. ' In
January, 1865, he was commissioned Eirst Lieutenant in the seventh reg-
iment of United States colored troops, stationed before Richmond, Va.,
and was appointed regimental quartermaster. He retained this office
for some months after the regiment was transferred to Indianola, Texas,
where he resigned his commission in August, 1866.
He now entered the Massachusetts Institute of Techonology to pur-


sue the study of civil engineering, which he had. chosen for his perma-
nent profession. Having completed the regular course of studies at
this school in 1868, he was immediately appointed assistant engineer
on the Bangor and Piscataquis railroad in Maine, and when that
was finished, he was employed under General George Thom on the
United States river and harbor improvements in Maine and New
Hampshire. This position he left to take the office of city engineer of
Bangor, which he held until called to the chair of civil engineering at
the University of Michigan in the fall of 1872. Shortly before this he
had declined an appointment to a similar chair in Washington Univer-
sity, at St. Louis.
Our department of civil engineering in the University of Mich-
igan had grown out of the "Scientific Course" of studies organized
here in 1853, and was opened in 1854 under the temporary charge of
Professor Winchell, who was transferred in the following year to the
chair of geology, and was succeeded in that of civil engineering by
Professor Peck. The latter, a graduate of West Point, had recently
resigned his commission of captain in the U. S. Army, and was ex-
pected to become the permanent head of our school of engineering.
But in 1857 he was induced to accept a professorship at Columbia
College,New York. Professor De Volson Wood, who was appointed his
successor, held the chair until the summer of 1872, when he very sud-
denly resigned. Under the able management of Professor Wood during
his fifteen years of service, the school had attained a high degree of
excellence, and had become widely and favorably known; and Professor
Greene, on taking charge in November, 1872, found the work well pre-
pared to his hands. He was still young, and without experience in
teaching, and he was called to take the place of a veteran and very
popular officer. No position could have subjected his abilities to a
severer test; and no one could have more successfully sustained the
trial. Professor Greene with the advantages of a liberal or general edu-
cation, and a thorough special training for his profession, had now also
gained much actual experience in it; but, more than this, he possessed
certain traits of character, without which no amount of knowledge and
experience can make an instructor of the highest order: quiet self-
possession, that suggests reserved force, and gives perfect control of
others; enthusiasm in his work, inspired by faith in its great importance
and usefulness: clearness of apprehension, with a clear and clean-cut
style of statement: and finally what is not less essential, a hearty
interest in the progress and welfare of his students.


3
The classes for a moment, especially the more advanced classes, had
that restive feeling which change of instructors usually creates. For
students are unwilling to give to a new comer the place in their confi-
dence and esteem which they think belongs of right to a favorite pre-
decessor. But students also quickly recognize a true man; one in
whom they discover at once manhood, strength, simplicity, honor, and
that well poised judgment which we call a level head. They soon
began to feel that confidence in his teachings, and that respect and
affection for his person, which have been heartily accorded to this
most estimable officer from that day to this. And so the department
moved on as steadily as if no new hand had taken the helm.
The limits of this article forbid any detailed account of the history
of the department since Professor Greene has been in charge. Suffice it
to say that under his wise management, seconded by his accomplished
and able associates, Professor Davis and Professor Denison, the work
in civil engineering has been gaining constantly in breadth and
solidity, and has at the present moment a reputation of which the
University may well be proud. In its students not only has the highest
possible attainment been insisted upon, but they have been taught to
entertain a deep sense of their responsibility to the state and the
country as the followers of a profession 'which involves such vast
interests of property and life. And their improvement, and culture,
too, have been promoted by the warm encouragement given by Profes-
sor Greene to their collateral studies, and to their voluntary organiza-
tion as a society of engineers.
But he has not confined his effort to the special work of his own
chair. He has by speaking the right word at the right moment
brought about the organization of the coordinate branches of mining
and mechanical engineering. The former was established in 1874 and
placed in charge of Professor Pettee.
The department of Mechanical, including Marine Engineering, was
opened in consequence of the act of Congress in 1878, authorizing the
Secretary of the Navy to detail engineering officers of the Navy to give
instruction in Universities and Scientific Schools. Professor Greene in
1880, desiring to take advantage of this provision, advised the then
Acting President to apply for the detail of such an officer from the
navy. The fortunate result was the appointment of Professor Morti-
mer E. Cooley to the new chair of Mechanical Engineering. Thus
chiefly through the influence and agency of Professor Greene the
University now embraces among its several professional and technical


The Technic.
schools, a Department of Engineering consisting of three well estab-
lished, well equipped and flourishing branches.
Meantime he has been active and efficient outside of the University,
not only in practical works of engineering, but also in promoting the
interest of his profession both as a member of scientific associations,
and as a contributor to scientific literature.
He was chief engineer of the Toledo, Ann Arbor and Northern rail-
road in 1880, and in that capacity designed and built the trestle bridge
'over the Huron at Ann Arbor, a work described in "Abstracts of Papers
in Foreign Transactions," published by the Institution of Civil Engi-
neers of Great Britain in 1881, Vol. 54. He was in 1882 superintending,
and then consulting engineer of the Wheeling and Lake railroad bridge
across the Maumee at Toledo, and also consulting engineer in 1883 of
the Cherry Street bridge in Toledo. He also furnished the engineer-
ing plans and superintended the construction of the water works of Ann
Arbor in 1885, and planned water works for Pontiac and Ypsilanti in
1886.
In scientific investigation he has given much attention to the devel-
opment of graphical methods of analysis pertaining to frames and other
structures. Among his numerous papers and publications may be men-
tioned a brief treatise on "The Analysis of Bridge Trusses," in 1875, and
"Papers on Roof Trusses," published in the Engineering Neios, 1875-6. A
more important publication was "Graphics for Engineers," which ap-
peared in three Parts: the first on Roof Trusses, in 1876, the second on
Bridge Trusses, in April, 1879, and the third on Arches, in December,
1879. Of these, parts Second and Third are devoted largely to a method
of graphical analysis original with the author, and have been well
received and extensively used by the engineering profession. His mis-
cellaneous scientific articles and book-reviews written of late years have
appeared in Science and other technical periodicals.
Professor Greene was President of the Michigan Association of En-
gineers and Surveyors for three years from its organization in 1880, and
contributed several papers to its transactions. He has also been a mem-
ber of the American Society of Civil Engineers since January, 1882.
He has received, besides the degree of A. B. at Harvard in 1862, the
degree of A. M. at the same university in 1865, that of B. S. at the Mas-
sachusetts Institute of Technology in 1868, and that of C. E. from the
University of Michigan in 1884.
Finally, I cannot conclude this brief and very inadequate sketch of
a life already so fruitful, without observing that Professor Greene is
*

among those members of our Faculty, who, in their love and strong pref-
erence for the University of Michigan, have declined invitations to
other positions, tempting both on account of higher salaries and some-
times, perhaps, of more brilliant surroundings. He has bravely sacri-
ficed the opportunity of more generous remuneration elsewhere, notwith-
standing, the difficulty of living on the compensation hitherto received
by our Professors, and the impossibility of saving from it any provision
for the future. And to his deep interest in the progress of the work he
has been so long conducting here, and his desire to see it still more per-
fectly developed and brought to a still higher level, we owe our good
fortune in still retaining his services in tjie University, and in still en-
joying, what I hope we shall never lose, his genial companionship.

ENGINEERING EXPERIENCES.
When Thomas Telford and his associates received the Royal Charter
from George the Fourth, incorporating the British Institute of Civil
Engineers, on the third of June, 1828, it contained these memorable and
often quoted words: "The profession of a Civil Engineer, being the art
of directing the great sources of power in Nature for the use and con-
venience of man."
This definition is at once so comprehensive and so exact as to have
been widely accepted as a standard, and frequently referred to.
These words established in 1828,—the year before George Stephen-
spn's "Rocket" had settled, at Rainhill, the Locomotive Question,—still
speak to us truthfully of the high calling, not of the Civil Engineer
only, but of the Engineer. Called,—to what? To "Direct the great
sources of power in Nature for the use and convenience of man." Has
he been true to his calling? His experiences shall answer.
Who has set bounds to the sea? Who has built the moles, break-
waters, dykes and defenses against the power of the waves?
Who has turned the currents of great rivers to do his bidding?
When Capt. James B. Eads guided the course of the Mississippi and
made it obey his will, he gave answer. An answer, too, that will never
fail to mark a period in the world's history.
Who raises and lowers great ships of thousands of tons weight as
simply as a chip is floated in a pail? The inquirer can learn at Sault de
Ste. Marie, in Michigan. There our own Alfred Noble has written a


The Technic.
line in engineering history. Reflect that the engineer writes his history
upon the face of Nature—as only the Almighty does besides—imitating
reverentially in this degree the handiwork of Him who has always been,
and must always remain, the great Master and Instructor of men in
these pursuits.
Who crosses the wild ocean in a week? We of our day instinctively
turn our thoughts to the giant steam ocean racers of to-day. True, they
are among our chief wonders. But how few know that it is but re-
cently that steam has been able to cross the Atlantic in the time made
by the white-winged ships of the last generation. It may be that not
the last of the noble men who built and commanded those grand vessels
is yet gone to his reward, feo readily do men forget the grandest
achievements in the presence of some new work. Yet the story of these
men and ships, that literally roamed the earth, reads as if it were a
romance. From New York to Cape Horn,—from Cape Horn to San
Francisco,—thence to Canton,—thence by Cape of Good Hope to London
and onwards home to New York or Boston. The circumnavigation of
the globe became an ordinary incident of commerce. Did these men
"Direct a great source of power in Nature for the use and convenience
of man" when they made the fickle wind drive their magnificent ships
round and round the world? In Harper's Magazine for January, 1884,
is given a brief summary of some of the deeds of these men and the
performances of their ships. Here it tells of the clipper ship Samuel
Russel, Captain N. B. Palmer, and her voyage from New York to Can-
ton and return, in which she sailed 318 miles in one day, and brought to
New York the first news of her arrival in Canton. The Flying Cloud
once performed the unequalled feat of sailing 433J^ miles from noon of
one day to noon of the next. The same vessel went from New York to
San Francisco in 84 days. There was the Sovereign of the Seas and her
invincible captain, Lauchlan McKay, who left New York for San Fran-
cisco in August, 1851, with freight, for carrying which he would receive
$84,000. When off Valparaiso this ship lost everything above the lower
masts of her fore and main masts, in a storm. Captain McKay rigged
his ship at sea in 14 days, and proceeding on his way reached San Fran-
cisco in 102 days, the best passage ever made at that season of the year.
On her return voyage she sailed from Honolulu to New York in 82 days
—a passage never equalled. For 10,000 miles she sailed without tacking
or wearing, and made 3,300 in ten consecutive days. And so the story
goes on as if it were a fable instead of the barest catalogue of daily facts.
And who built these wonderful vessels? William II. Webb, of New


7
York, built many of them. This record says: "He has built 177,872 tons
in 138 vessels,—probably more than any other man that ever lived."
And the record tells this in a parenthesis. It is a record of the greatest
deeds. Yet who knows these men or their work? They ruled the seas
and oceans, nevertheless, and drew from the winds and currents their
deepest secrets, and the builders cunningly shaped these vessels to speed
along their circling courses, whose only limit was the world. They an-
swer in their place whether they have been true to their high calling and
destiny by experiences so wonderful that the most meager list of them
reads like a tale. The world has never seen its equal.
Who opened the secrets of Nature and turned the earth-borne ore
into iron and steel? When Sir I. Lowthian Bell wrested from the Blast
Furnace its chemical and physical secrets, he gave answer. When Alex-
ander L. Holley made the direct process of steel-making obey the pur-
poses of his will, he also gave answer. It is the engineer!
So may we question in every direction. There is the steam, the wind,
the current, the electricity, the chemic forces—there is the power of ex-
plosives,—for destruction and salvation. Wherever the great sources of
power in Nature have been directed for the use and convenience of man,
—there!—has stood the engineer writing the material history of man-
kind, as God writes the material history of Nature. And be sure these
men have ever been devout learners from the handiwork of their Cre-
ator, and devout servants of Him who holdeth the sea in the hollow of
his hand.
Have these great works been easy of accomplishment? No! Great
men and great works are not made so. In poverty and often in distress,
usually with disappointment, treachery, deceit, and betrayal, have these
wonderful men worked on to success,—such as the world cannot give or
take away. Their lives teach us that he who works with truth,—that is,
with God,—need have no fear: he is already with the great majority.
He can afford to fail as this world counts failures. He can afford to die,
as many of them have, young or in prime, full of the greatness of their
powers and opportunities,—Rankine at 42, Holley at 50,—or he can re-
main as did Ashbel Welsh with his white crown of noble deeds, typified
by the white crown bestowed by nature upon every worthy head, to
counsel and encourage those of us who are younger in the path of truth,
virtue, integrity—and hard work. Holley's father wrote to him: "Man
is to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow." "It is an injunction of
the Most High." Great engineers are great workers. Great workers
for truth. Great men, then. Yes!


The Technic.
Holley wrote in March, 1861, that he had an engagement with the
publishers of Webster's Unabridged Dictionary to write a lot of engi-
neering words and definitions, and similar matter, for the sum of $200.
He needed the money. It was necessary for him to get it. He was then
about 29 and a trained engineer of experience, so faithful had he been.
What next? April 23d, 1861, he offered his services tb the Government
of the United States in its peril, "Without compensation, desiring only
that his necessary expenses be paid, as he had not the money to pay
them." Was the offer accepted '{ No! And Holley endorsed his papers
(his own copy) with the significant words, "The end." His communica-
tions were not even acknowledged. What shall we say! How would
we take such rebuffs of a devoted patriotism that in poverty and dis-
tress had led us still freely to offer all we had,—our trained powers and
our lives,—only to have the offer not even noticed? Well! We don't
know a thing about it! That is all! This rebuff only turned our sub-
ject to the very door that opened out to the beginning of the pathway of
his splendid career. He stood in company with Ericsson, Ellet, Stevens,
and other distinguished engineers. They were rebuffed also. He was
not alone. His associates were honorable. He could afford to wait,
poor as he was. He did wait, and when they buried him at 50 years of
age, dear friends—made so by respect for his noble manhood,—felt con-
strained to say, here lies "America's greatest engineer." And in his line
these words speak only the truth.
So we learn they are men purified by trial,—made perfect by suffering.
Were they men of courage? All the world dearly loves a courage-
ous man. We hardly need any answer. The man who faces the ocean,
the torrent, the lightning, and the tempest, and safely provides against
their terrors, or makes them do his bidding, can hardly be a timid, fear-
some man. When the often cited Eddystone Lighthouse was planted off
Plymouth Harbor in the very midst of the wildest Atlantic seas, men
may well have trembled. But what had Smeaton done? He had shown
the world how to build such structures. Now Spectacle Reef Light
stands in Lake Huron and divides the fields of grinding ice driven east-
ward through the Straits of Mackinaw by the wintry storms; and Stan-
nard's Rock Light Tower keeps its lonely watch over the dangers of our
greatest inland sea, forty miles from land. More,—who can tell the
names of the men that built them? They can be found, but not easily.
Michael Angelo and St. Peter's are inseparable, but whose names are
coupled with the mighty cathedrals scattered over Europe? Or, who
knows the other great names that cluster about St. Peter's?


9
When men stretched a wire beneath the sea, that the continents
might speak together, was there no courage? But a cable may be laid
every year now, and not one of us even know where it is.
When the oceans were united by lines of iron, was there no courage
in the first attempt? But no one knows now when a Pacific Railroad is
finished. It may even be that now a single man owns, or controls, such
a line from sea to sea.
No need of going further! It is enough!
How do these men study nature, learn her secrets, and get God's
teaching?
Scott Russel galloped the banks of a canal to see what became of a
wave of translation. Result: The Great Eastern floated the ocean as a
pure example of the wave line model of a vessel.
Captain Eads lived on and in the waters of the great river till he
knew its history. Then he cut the willows on its banks and guided it

and grain on the plains and uplands of the Father of Great Waters, for

in ocean-going vessels through an open river mouth.
So the builders of the Clipper Ships studied the pressure ol the wind,
the pressure of the water, the applications of them both to their ships,
and made the hulls and sails, and cunningly devised and balanced each
part in its place, till these wonderful vessels touched the flood mark of
achievement in their line.
Patient, persistent, intimate, experimental, painstaking study and
devoted attention teach these men their ways. They will teach all men

The Royal Road is the road over which these friends of the Almighty,—
to whom He willingly revealed his handiwork,—have travelled. He and

CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF ROADS.
Any person, who has had occasion to travel over the ordinary roads
of the country, has seen the need of some more efficient supervision in
the construction and maintenance of these important elements of our
civilization. But just what this management ought to be, is a question
not so easily answered. It will of course be impossible in a paper of this
length, to do more than to outline the work. I shall, therefore, give a
brief survey of the opinions and methods of a few of the authorities on
the subject, without making any attempt at originality.
One of the most needed changes in the maintenance of our roads, is
to place them under the charge of men who have given time and study
to the subject of road making instead of the men who now, in most
cases, hold the office of Overseers of the Highways. Of course it is not
to be expected that all of our roads will be put in first-class condition,
even under the best of management; but there is certainly room for a
vast improvement even in the methods of making common dirt roads,
and in perhaps the majority of cases, this is all that can be expected


The Technic.
for some time to come. In making an ordinary turnpike, for example,
the usual method is to begin in the middle, and, with a plough, turn the
edges toward the center, until the surface has, what is thought to be,
about the right convexity, and then the surface is smoothed off with a
drag or scraper. It is in the convexity of the road surface that a serious
mistake is often made. Our roads are many of them turned up so high
that the travel is all driven to the center. This of course leaves the
sides in a comparatively soft condition, and as soon as the road is soft-
ened by rain, the excessive wear on the center soon causes it to become
rutty, and thus the water is held, by these ruts and holes, where it will do
the most damage to the road. If, on the other hand, the convexity were
not so great, the travel would be more uniformly distributed over the
surface of the road and the sides would bear their part of the travel;
and in a wet time we would not have that excessive wear on the center
of the road and would avoid much of the trouble now experienced dur-
ing the spring and fall. The use of heavy road rollers, or even of ordU
nary farm rollers, where better cannot be had, has been found very bene-
ficial in many places.
Another thing to be avoided in turnpiking, is the breaking up of the
center of the road-bed, as this will cause the layers of earth to settle
horizontally, or even, in some cases, to settle so as to be lower in the
center than at the sides, even though the surface may be quite convex.
This of course is not conducive to a proper drainage of the road-bed.
The drainage of the road-bed is one of the most important parts of
its construction and maintenance; and especially is this true of the class
of roads which we are now considering. Without proper drainage the
best of roads soon become rough; and roads surfaced with common
earth may even become impassable in a country where the soil is clayey.
The first thing to be considered in the matter of drainage is the side
drains, for carrying the water to some suitable outlet. For this purpose,
the ditches, from which the dirt has been taken to form the foundation
for the road, will be found, in many cases, to be ample, if they are prop-
erly cared for. In many cases at present, these ditches are allowed to
All up with weeds, etc., and serve as reservoirs to hold the water, rather
than as ditches to carry it away. In other cases, special ditches may
become necessary, and should be of sufficient depth and capacity to take
the water away quickly and under the worst conditions. In some cases
these drains may need to be covered, but this involves considerable extra
expense and is seldom necessary. In most cases these side drains will
be all that is needed; but, where it is necessary to use clay in the con-


13
struction of the foundation of the road, it may be found necessary to
use miter drains, in order to properly drain the road-bed. These should
be put in at intervals of from 100 ft. to 200 ft., and are most cheaply and
best constructed with ordinary drain tile of about \% in. to 2 in. in
diameter. Miter drains should be laid in the form of a letter V, with
the vertex at the center of the road, and should have a slope of about
one in one hundred. They should be placed deep enough to be safe from
all danger of being injured by wheels in any condition of the road,
either during construction or afterwards. They should be placed end
to end and covered with hay or straw before the dirt is filled in. This
will prevent the dirt from silting in too rapidly. On long stretches of
straight grade, catch waters should be constructed to turn the water from
the center of the road and prevent it from following the wheel tracks,
and to convey it to the side drains. Catch waters should also be placed
at the intersection of grades sloping in opposite directions.
Having pointed out a few of the points to be considered in the con-
struction of dirt roads, let us next take up some of the better classes
of roads. There are two of these that I propose to speak of in this
paper, viz., gravel roads and broken stone roads. By gravel roads, I
mean those built of selected gravel containing but little earth. In
building gravel or broken stone roads, the form of cross section needs
to be more carefully considered than where the road is to be surfaced
with common earth. As to what this form should be there are two
opinions, each of which has the support of men who are authorities upon
the subject of road making. The first of these is, that the cross section
of the surface should be a curve; Telford, one of the most celebrated
of English engineers, recommending a flat ellipse. The second is, that
the cross section should be two straight lines joined at the top by a
short circular curve, the slope of the sides being about one in twenty,
and the radius of the curve about 85 or 90 feet. The objections offered
to the first forms are: that they are much more difficult to construct;
and that the travel is driven too much into the center of the road, thus,
as pointed out in dirt roads, causing the surface to become rutty more
quickly. The curved forms also require more longitudinal slope to be
as effective, in the drainage of the surface, as the straight line form,
which gives good drainage without making the slope such as to drive
the travel to the center of the roadway.
It seems to be the opinion of many, that the narrower we can make
the metaled part of the road, whether it be of gravel or broken stone,
the less expensive it will be to keep it in repair. The truth is, however,


The Technic.
that the amount of material required to keep a road in repair is not
.dependent on the width of road at all, but on the amount of travel;
while the whole cost of keeping the road in repair is much less in the
case of a good broad road than in that of a narrow one. Gen. Q. A.
Gillmore give as the best average width of roadbed, about sixteen or
seventeen feet for ordinary roads, twenty-seven to thirty feet for the
most important, and eight or nine feet for those that have very little
travel.
In parts of the country where good clean gravel is abundant, it will
probably always be preferred to broken stone on account of its cheap-
ness. But the latter, though expensive, is more durable and requires no
binding material, as the angular fragments soon of themselves form a
compact mass. It is claimed by some, that even in using common
gravel, no earth should be left in it, but that it should be sifted, put
upon the road, and made to furnish its own binding by the action of
travel. This method, however, is objectionable, as it takes the surface
much longer to become compact; much of the material is powdered by
the action of the wheels and hence is much more easily affected by the
action of water and travel. The proper amount of binding material
is a harder question to settle definitely, but may be determined for any
class of gravel by trial. Too much, however, is better than not enough,
as the surplus- soon works to the surface and may be scraped to the
sides and drawn away, leaving the road in fine condition. Here, it may
be well to mention, is a mistake often made in the care of gravel roads,
that is, of scraping the material from the sides into the center, instead
of from the center to the sides. As a general thing this dirt is the
extra binding that has been worked up through the gravel by the
wheels and has been washed to the sides by the rain. This is worse
than useless as a surface material and should never be scraped back as
is so often done, but should be scraped to the sides and drawn away.
In some parts of the country gravel is not to be found, and here
broken stone must take its place. This method of forming a smooth,
hard surface for roads was discovered by McAdam, and is named for
him. The stones were formerly broken by hand with steel-faced ham-
mers, and the process was much more costly then than now, when, by
machinery, the stones are broken much more evenly and rapidly, and
afterwards sifted and prepared for use. All this is done at an expendi-
ture of about one horse-power per cubic yard, broken per hour. By this
process, the fragments of rock are left in angular pieces, of uniform
size, and, when properly spread upon the road, soon form a smooth, even


15
surface which is very durable under ordinary traffic. The road metal,
whether of ordinary gravel, or broken stone, should be spread on in thin
layers of from two to four inches in thickness, and then either rolled
with a heavy roller until thoroughly packed, or else left to be brought
to this condition by the travel. The former is the better way, but, as
road rollers are quite expensive, it may sometimes be found better to use
the latter. After this layer has been well packed, another may be added
and treated as before. From five to ten inches is the thickness laid down
by McAdam for ordinary roads.
In the matter of drainage the methods are not materially different
from those described for dirt roads.
While these roads are expensive as to first cost, there is a credit as
well as a debit side to the account. The cost of such a road varies from
$2,000 to $3,000 per mile. This provides for a covering six inches deep
and sixteen feet wide. This seems like a large sum to be expended for
road purposes, but the cost for repair is not great, and the saving in
power, required to move a given load, is very great. Morin found, after
a long and careful series of experiments, that between a good dirt road
and a broken stone road the comparison was about as follows:
Good firm soil covered with from 4 to 6 inches of gravel, a force =
i of weight of vehicle and load is required to move it.
Firm embankment with gravel surface, TV.
If in very good condition, j^.
Broken stone road, very bad condition, thick mud and deep ruts,
If firm, with mud and ruts, J?.
If but little moist or dusty, S'T-
If in very good condition, J*.
The gravel referred to in the above table is that containing a consid-
erable surplus of binding material; and hence, may be considered to
represent fairly well the ordinary material used in the construction of
dirt roads. This comparison shows what a saving may be brought about
by such a change in the quality of our roads, and seems to indicate that
even a greater expense than that mentioned might with profit be" in-
curred on many of the principal highways. "W. H. Pease.

CEMENTS, AND RAW MATERIALS FROM WHICH THEY
ARE MADE.
The term cement, in its broadest sense, has a very comprehensive
range and is applied to many things widely different from what was
denoted by the Latin word from which it was derived. In that
language, eaementa, a contraction of caedimenta, meant the unhewn,
untrimmed blocks of stone, as they came from the quarry, and as they
were used in the construction of walls. In many cases, the rocks quar-
ried were marble or limestone, and, as rocks of that class would have to
be depended on for the needed supply of quicklime for the making of
mortar, it is easy to see how it ultimately came to pass that the name
originally applied to the stone was employed to designate a product
obtained by calcination from the stone; and now, to-day, the term
cement includes an almost countless number of substances, not only of
mineral but also of animal or vegetable origin, which, when interposed
in a liquid or in a pasty condition between surfaces of like or of unlike
bodies, are capable of solidifying in that position, and, by adhering
strongly to the surfaces, making a joint, whose strength may not only
equal, but in some cases much exceed that of the original bodies them-
selves.
i
Among engineers, architects, and builders, however, the word,
when used in a technical sense, is understood to be limited to a rather
small list of substances, some of them natural and some of them arti-
ficial, which, when properly prepared for use and applied under certain
conditions, possess the property of solidifying and hardening even
though they be immersed under water, thus forming an important class
of structural materials, that stands in marked contrast with the com-
mon mortars used in the walls of buildings that are not to be exposed
to any excess of moisture above that ordinarily occurring in the atmos-
phere.
It is to cements in this restricted sense that attention is more espe-
cially directed in the present paper. The original purpose of the writer
was to confine himself pretty closely to questions of a geological or
mineralogical character connected with the natural occurrence of the
raw material used in the manufacture of cements in the form in which
they are usually placed on the market. In what follows, it will be seen
that some departure from this purpose has been made, but there has been


17
no attempt to cover the whole ground suggested by the title placed at
the head of the paper, nor any attempt to present any new facts or new
discoveries;—anything, that is, that could hot be found by searching
through the literature of the subject as it is scattered in special treatises,
encyclopaedias, technical dictionaries, and other works of reference.
One striking generalization or hypothesis of science is that the mole-
cules of matter in its various forms and modifications may be regarded
as in constant motion—usually, it is true, within very narrow bounda-
ries,—and that changes in the character or the extent of the motion are
attended by corresponding changes in the chemical and physical proper-
ties of the substances immediately affected. Under the influence of
variations in temperature, pressure, or moisture, for example, almost all
substances pass more or less rapidly from one state or condition to an-
other. In many cases the rate of change is extremely slow, so that the
results are not immediately perceptible, and it is by no means always
easy to find any adequate explanation for the observed phenomena;—
any explanation, that is, which amounts to much more than classifying
the special case in hand under a general category that includes other
instances of a similar character.
The geologist finds evidence that some rocks, now crystalline in
texture, were once in a fragmental condition; but he seldom or never
detects such a change going on at a measurable rate before his eyes. The
geologist also sees abundant evidence for believing that some rocks, now
firm, solid, and compact, once consisted of loose, detached, incoherent
grains or fragments, which have become adherent to each other by the
intervention of additional material brought from some outside source;
but, as before, it is very rarely the case that the beginning and the end
of any particular change of this character, sufficient in magnitude to
attract an observer's attention, both fall within the limits of a single
lifetime, or indeed within the limits of historical time.
In pseudomorphous crystals, the mineralogist sees a direct result of
molecular rearrangement, or of a substitution of ope kind of matter
for another that once occupied the same portion of space; and incrusta-
tions on the walls of fissures or cavities in rocks—especially those to
which water has had access—still further illustrate the same general
law.
The foregoing instances have been cited by way of support of the
broad, comprehensive proposition, that, provided the proper conditions
are satisfied, many or nearly all kinds of matter with which the geolo-
gist and mineralogist have to deal—that is to say, inorganic or mineral
2


The Technic.
matter—are liable slowly to change their state; and that a much greater
variety of substances than would be supposed by any one unfamiliar
with the natural sciences, appear to be capable, under the influence of
natural causes alone, of acting the part of a glue or cement in holding
together the particles that constitute a mass of rock. Any notion, there-
fore, that the cements which are adapted for use in stone work are all
necessarily identical, or even approximately identical in chemical or
in mineral composition, may be at once dismissed from the mind.
In natural rock masses of the f ragmental, or clastic, type, the cement-
ing portion can usually be designated, with a sufficient degree of precis-
ion, as siliceous, calcareous, argillaceous, ferruginous, or bituminous,
according as one or another of these kinds of matter is dominant; and
these classes are all more or less clearly recognizable also in the common
manufactured cements or in the numerous compounds recommended for
special purposes. In rock masses it is not unfrequently difficult to dis-
tinguish with the unassisted eye the surface of adhesion between the
original grains or fragments and the binding material, especially when
the mineral character of the two portions of the mass is essentially the
same. The separate grains are firmly held together, and, when the rock
is broken, the surface of fracture is often as likely to pass directly across
one of the original fragments as it is to pass between two of them.
These natural cements accumulate only with great slowness, but,
notwithstanding this fact, they seldom assume a crystalline texture.
Their appearance is more apt to resemble what might be expected from
a gradual addition of matter, whose molecules had some, though not a
perfect, freedom of motion; not that extreme freedom, which, except
possibly in the crystallization of metamorphic rocks, where the element
of time and of pressure doubtless has great influence on the result, seems
to be almost an essential prerequisite in crystallization. In this respect,
indeed, they are fairly comparable with the cements used in the arts,
which, at the outset, harden, or set, at a relatively rapid rate,—a rate
quite incompatible with definite and distinct crystallization; though
without doubt in the process of hardening there are movements among
the molecules that in kind are not unlike the movements which take
place when crystals are actually forming; and possibly the hardening
may be attended with the production of minute crystals, too small to be
recognized as such without the aid of special apparatus designed for the
purpose.
After this summary account of the character and the mode of action
of what in a very rigid sense may be called the natural cements,—an


19
account, which, it is hoped, may help to clear away any possible errone-
ous preconception and false notion as to the nature of cements in
general,—attention may be directed more definitely to the special feat-
ures of some of the commercial cements that are to be found in the
markets of to-day, with reference mainly to a few of their geological,
mineralogical, and chemical relations.
To be of commercial value, a cement must possess certain properties,
such as ease of manipulation, uniformity of composition so that it can
be depended upon in all cases to do the expected work, a rapidity of set-
ting neither too great nor too small, and a capacity of acquiring when
set an adequate strength. In addition, it must be obtainable at a price
not unreasonably high. Many substances, otherwise unobjectionable,
might find favor, were they not too expensive, or did they not set at so
slow a rate as to preclude their use in any case where rapidity of con-
struction is of importance.
In the further development of the line of thought followed in this
paper, a choice of two paths lies open. The attention may first be turned
to the chemical or mineral compounds that possess the properties re-
quired in a good cement, after which an effort may be made to ascertain
what available supplies there are of rock from which these compounds
may be cheaply and satisfactorily prepared. The alternative course is to
pass in review the more common varieties of rock that have proved to
be of value in this connection, and in this review endeavor to learn
wherein the special value lies, and how the value is liable to be modified
by incidental changes of structure or composition.
The second course presents some advantages in the present instance,
and, inasmuch as practically the mortars and cements in#common use
for building purposes include only such as can be made from cheap and
abundant raw materials, it will be the sands, clays, and limestones that
are most important to notice. For special uses, indeed, more expensive
cements are admissible or even indispensable, and one or two of these
will be briefly alluded to further on.
The term limestone, as ordinarily used, includes a great variety of
rocks, and rocks of very unequal value when considered as sources of
mortars and cements. The theoretically pure, normal limestone is sim-
ply an aggregate of individual grains of the mineral calcite, held to-
gether either in consequence of a crystalline texture or by the aid of a
binding material, which itself has the same chemical composition as
calcite, namely, carbonate of calcium,—44 per cent, being carbonic acid,
and 56 per cent, calcium oxide.


The Technic.
When such a limestone, free from admixture of impurities, is kept
for a sufficient length of time at a sufficiently high temperature, in a
properly constructed kiln, the carbonic acid is driven off and the calcium
oxide is left behind. This goes generally, and indifferently, by the name
of caustic lime, quicklime, or simply lime. The property of quicklime
that makes it serviceable in the preparation of mortar, is its power of
combining with water and with carbonic acid, of which there is always
a small amount present in the atmosphere, and, in consequence, assum-
ing again the solid, compact condition, though not by any means forming
a new body identical in composition or in properties with the original
limestone. A mass of pure quicklime, therefore, if left to itself, exposed
to the air, may be expected slowly to unite with water and with carbonic
acid, and in course of time to have its chemical affinity for these sub-
stances so far satisfied as to form a mixture of calcium hydrate and
calcium carbonate in which further exposure will produce little or no
change; but it by no means follows that the several components present
in the mixture will be agglomerated together in one large solid mass, or
that it will form, under the supposed conditions, ah efficient cement.
The lime has simply become air-slaked.
In the ordinary processes of slaking, the conversion of a quicklime
into a hydrate is hastened by the addition of a sufficient amount of water
at one time to satisfy the chemical affinities, the percentage of carbon-
ate formed in the process being quite small, if any; and the hydrate,
which fills about three times the volume occupied by the original quick-
lime, has the consistency of a pasty mass, which, on prolonged exposure
to the air, becomes slowly changed in character by the absorption of car-
bonic acid, the change taking place gradually from the exterior toward
the interior the mass and being accompanied by a considerable shrink-
age in volume. In the preparation of ordinary mortar the effects of the
shrinkage of the calcareous ingredient are counteracted by the addition
of sand, which acts mechanically by breaking up the mass of the lime
into thin films occupying the interstices between the grains of sand; and
in these films the solidifying and setting of the mortar goes on in the
most efficient manner. Chemically, the sand is inert or contributes only
after long contact to the formation of small quantities of calcium sili-
cate.
If the slaked lime, either with or without sand, were to be kept under
•water, the change to a carbonate and the incipient crystallization of the
hydrate would not take place, and there would be no solidification, and
consequently no cementing effect accomplished.


21
In the precediDg paragraphs it has been taken for granted that use
was made of a pure quicklime made from a pure calcite. Such a lime
is known as a fat lime; and the same term is applied to lime, even when
impurities are present, provided the impurities do not materially modify
the slaking process. As a matter of fact so-called fat limes are not
infrequently obtained from limestones containing from one to ten per
cent, of impurities.
Before specifying particularly what these impurities are, it may be
worth while to consider lor a moment how it is that their presence in
the limestone is to be accounted for, and why indeed their presence
ought to be expected.
Considered with respect to their origin, there are two great classes
of rocks that are radically different from each other:—one class owes its
existence and its peculiar characters to the action of heat:—the class of
igneous rocks; the other class, the so-called aqueous rocks, were formed
by the aid of water action. These two classes of rocks make up the
great bulk of those portions of the earth's crust that are accessible to
man; and it is to the latter of these two classes, that the limestones
belong. Some limestones, it is true, have lost many of their sedimentary
features by a process of metamorphism, but this fact introduces no diffi-
culty that needs taking into account in the present discussion.
Deposits of limestone very frequently contain within themselves the
evidence that they were formed almost or quite entirely from the
remains of animal organisms, the hard parts of mollusks, corals, etc.,
consisting chemically of calcium carbonate; and if such deposits had
accumulated in perfectly clear water, free from any and all sediment, no
good reason can be seen why the resulting limestone should not satisfy
the conception of what a pure limestone should be. But that "if" is an
important word. With the water of the sea in constant motion, and
with currents carrying finely divided mineral matter in a state of sus-
pension—floating or slowly settling—the wonder would be that any
limestone deposit should escape contamination, rather than that the
deposits in general should remain in a state of purity. But it was only
in the clearer waters—those free at any rate from excessive turbidity—
that the animal species which contribute most abundantly to the forma-
tion of limestone deposits, reached their highest development and were
most flourishing; and in such waters the percentage of impurity was
in many cases kept comparatively low. It must not be forgotten, how-
ever, that in sedimentary rocks one kind follows another in rather rapid
succession; that the beds are frequently only a few inches or a few feet


The Technic.
in thickness; that a limestone may rest upon a sandstone or upon an
argillaceous rock, and may be capped by any kind of sedimentary rock
that the changed conditions due to geological upheavals or subsidences
may have made possible; and that, while in some instances the transi-
tion from one variety of rock to another is sharp and abrupt, in other
cases the rocks record the geological history of long periods of time in
which there was no one controlling set of conditions so strikingly domi-
nant, as to impress its characteristic features on the rocks in process of
formation, to the exclusion of other features. In passing, for example,
from an older sandstone upwards in the geological column to a younger
limestone, it may sometimes be seen that the lower layers of the lime-
stone are more highly siliceous than those occurring higher up; so, also,
where there is a transition from a limestone to a clay, it may happen
that at some point intermediate between the purer, standard, limestone
and the pure clay that there will be beds that partake of the character-
istic properties of both limestone and clay, and are designated as argil-
laceous limestones, calcareous clays, or marls.
It is sufficiently clear, then, that one may expect to find as impuri-
ties, in so-called limestones, any of the minerals, or any of the kinds of
mineral matter, that enter at all largely, into the composition of sedi-
mentary rocks in general; and it is obvious that no good reason can be
urged for supposing that the limestones of any particular geological
formation, or geological age, would, on theoretical grounds, be more, or
less, likely than those of any other formation or age to contain any spe-
cial kind or any special amount of impurity. This theoretical view is
amply supported by observed facts, for limestones of the composition
required for the manufacture of hydraulic cements are found at several
different geological horizons all the way from the lowest Silurian to the
mesozoic and tertiary.
Returning now from this digression to the point of departure, it
maybe stated in brief that the impure limestones—those which on burn-
ing do not yield a pure, fat, quicklime, but which are still utilizable in
the manufacture of water limes and hydraulic cements, are made impure
by an excess of arenaceous, sandy, siliceous, matter; by an excess of
argillaceous, clayey, ingredients; or by the presence of magnesium. The
last mentioned chemical ingredient is usually, when present, combined
with carbonic acid, and thus imparts to the stone a dolornitic character.
The true dolomite is a rock, or mineral, containing about fifty-lour per
cent, calcium carbonate and forty-six per cent, magnesium carbonate.
There is also usually found in the impure limestones a greater or less


23
quantity of iron oxide and a small percentage of some alkaline ingredi-
ents; and these substances doubtless exert an influence on the quality
of the calcined product, though in the explanations suggested to account
for the property of setting under water, comparatively little stress is
laid upon their presence.
The three principal classes of ingredients—sand, clay, and magne-
sium—either alone or in conjunction with each other, may simply act to
weaken the lime and make it less valuable; or they may impart to it the
additional property of hardening and setting under water, thus convert-
ing common lime into a hydraulic or water lime, or a cement, as the
case may be; and, in water limes and hydraulic cements, variations in
the kind and amount of the impurities may introduce modifications both
in respect to activity and to strength or energy. By hydraulic activity
is meant the property of hardening quickly under water, at least so far
as to resist crushing by the hand alone; and by hydraulic energy or
strength the property of acquiring ultimately, perhaps not until after
several months or even several years, a power of resisting pressures,
strains, and shocks, rivaling the strength of natural stone. It is also of
importance to notice in this connection that a great deal depends on the
way the impurities are distributed in a limestone. If, as is frequently
the case, they are finely disseminated through the stone, so that the
stone may very properly be called homogeneous, the products of calcina-
tion can be trusted to work uniformly, whether well or ill; but if the
distribution is irregular, the burning of the stone will yield an uneven
product, one which is likely to fail at some critical moment or to cause
imperfections or blemishes to appear in a piece of completed work.
When the percentage of mixed impurities in a limestone runs above
ten per cent, and does not much if any exceed twenty-five per cent.,
especially if the impurity is largely sandy in character, the same being
in the form of small grains and chemically inactive, the lime obtained by
calcination will probably be what is termed poor or meagre; that is to
say, it does not slake quickly and does not fall so readily to powder in
the process of slaking. This sluggishness of action is probably attribu-
table not so much to the formation during calcination of any new, defi-
nite, chemical compound, as it is to the presence of the inert matter in
the form of sand or silica.
If a limestone contain from ten to twenty per cent, of clay, homo-
geneously distributed, and little or nothing else besides in the way of
impurity,it may properly be called an argillaceous limestone; and, when
properly treated, it may be expected to yield a hydraulic lime—one that


The Technic.
will set under water, but still be lacking in some of the qualities of the
high-grade cements. If the percentage of clay exceeds twenty per cent.,
without being in too great excess, the chances are, roughly speaking, in
favor of the stone yielding a characteristic cement, of good quality;
though, in ease the clay is irregularly distributed, it may be present to
the extent of thirty per cent, or more and impart only a moderate degree
of hydraulicity to the products of calcination.
In order to understand how it is that the presence of clay exerts so
strong a modifying influence on the products obtained by calcining
limestone, it is necessary to know what a clay is. As used to designate
an impurity in limestone, it does not necessarily denote any mineral of
a known, definite, constant, composition; but it includes a number of
mineral substances, mixed with each other in varying proportions, but
agreeing in one respect, namely, that they contain alumina and silica in
combination with water, that is to say, they are hydrous aluminium
silicates with varying percentages of alumina and silica. When an
argillaceous limestone is burned in a kiln, the first change that takes
place is, without doubt, the driving off of water from the clay and of
carbonic acid from the calcite; this leaves the quicklime that has been
formed, and the other chemical elements present, in condition to enter
into new combinations. What the resulting combinations will be can-
not generally be predicted in advance; they are known to depend upon
several modifying circumstances, the most important of which are the
relative amounts of calcite and clay, the homogeneity or lack of homo-
geneity in their mixture, and the temperature reached in the process of
calcination. With a small proportion or a very irregular distribution of
clay, it is evident that a large amount of the quicklime produced in the
burning would fail to combine with the silica or the alumina, and must
therofore exist as quicklime in the final product. This product, while it
might possess hydraulic activity in some slight degree, would probably
slake easily, even in lumps, on the addition of water, and would deserve
to be called by no stronger term than a moderately active hydraulic
lime. As the relative proportions of the principal ingredients in the
stone change by an increase in the amount of clay present, the amount
of free quicklime produced naturally grows less and less, and conse-
quently the burnt product slakes with less and less ease. A point is
soon reached where the lime will not slake at all, unless previously
reduced to powder by mechanical means; and, with proper proportions
of lime and clay the amount of quicklime may evidently become reduced
to nothing, and the pulverized product—now designated as cement—


may consist entirely of the new chemical combinations that possess
hydraulic energy in a marked degree. Any excess of clay beyond what
is needed to bring about this last result would act like any other inert
matter and proportionately diminish the value of the cement.
From what has preceded it is easy to understand why it is that
cements made at different places, or from different layers of stone at the
same place, exhibit very striking differences, and why it is necessary to
subject to very frequent and very careful tests all cements that are to
be employed in heavy structures, or are to be permanantly submerged
under water, or are to be exposed to the beating action of waves. It
cannot be supposed that the calcium silicate, the calcium-aluminium
silicate, and the calcium aluminate, all of which are regarded as con-
tributing to the hydraulic energy, will all always be present in the same
quantity, or in the combination that is most effective; indeed it is very
well known that from the same stone and the same chemical elements,
in the same kiln, products widely different in hydraulic value may be
obtained by changes in the method of firing and by changes in the tem-
perature at which the burning is carried on. Some stones yield the best
cement they are capable of yielding when burnt at a low heat—under-
burnt; others only when heated nearly to vitrification.
Nearly pure argillaceous limestones naturally adapted for making
hydraulic lime, and even hydraulic cement of high grade, occur abund-
antly in some parts of France, but it is not known that they exist in
the United States. The natural cement rocks of the United States,
like those from which the Kosendale, the Louisville, the Akron,
the Utica, and other well known brands of cement are made, con-
tain magnesium in addition to the clay and lime, and are designated
as argillaceous magnesian limestones. In the burning of stone of this
kind, products are formed analogous to those above referred to, but with
a larger or smaller amount of the calcium replaced by magnesium, a
chemical element that in some combinations is known to exhibit con-
siderable hydraulic energy, even without the presence of clay.
The uncertainties attending the production of cement directly from
natural rock are always serious in character and large in amount; and
natural rock is not in fact relied upon to any great extent where an arti-
cle of the very highest quality is required. In its place a manufactured
article made by combining in proper proportions clear, clean, white chalk
with carefully selected river clays, and then calcining in kilns especially
constructed for the purpose, is substituted, though at an expense some-
what greater than that for which cement from natural rock can be had.


The Technic.
Among the many names in use for describing the different brands
of hydraulic cement there are two—Roman and Portland—that have
come to acquire special significance. The former term, when used in a
general way, includes the quick-setting varieties, light in weight, aver-
aging about seventy pounds to the bushel, and dark in color, which
harden rather rapidly and quickly reach their maximum of induration;
the latter, in a similar way, includes varieties that may weigh from a
hundred and ten to a hundred and twenty-five or even more pounds to
the bushel, that are usually light gray in color, and that set rather more
slowly at the outset, but ultimately-acquire much greater strength.
A different class of cements, occupying a prominent place in market
reports, has an anhydrous calcium sulphate—plaster of Paris—for a
base. The calcined plaster hardens with great rapidity when mixed
with water, but it does not have the strength and hardness required for
heavy work. In Keene's cement, so-called, the base is said to be
powdered gypsum, which, wet with a solution of alum, is heated until
the combined water is driven off, after which it is ground and slaked
with alum water. In some other cements a sodium or potassium car-
bonate is added. In the manufacture of Parian cement it is said that
borax is employed. W. H. Pettee.
VENTILATION OF HOUSES.
The importance of having a sufficient supply of fresh air cannot
be over-estimated. It is beyond question that persons, who are con-
stantly compelled to breathe impure air, furnish a large percentage of
pulmonary affections. Phthisical patients, in the vast majority of
cases, are drawn from the classes whose occupation keeps them con-
fined to close rooms. Before much attention was given to ventilation,
the mortality from consumption amongst soldiers and criminals was
much greater than at present. The story of the "Black Hole," of Cal-
cutta, is familiar to everyone. Of 146 prisoners, confined in the cell at
night, 23 were alive in the morning, and among the survivors a fatal
form of typhus fever broke out, which carried off nearly all of them.
* Usually the effects of breathing impure air are not so sudden as this,
but we cannot, on that account, pronounce them any the less fatal.
It is very difficult to fix upon any standard of purity, as the amount
of impurity which may be present in the air, without producing any
injurious effects, varies with climate and temperature. The Esquimau


27
lives and thrives in air which would prove fatal in a very short time to
persons in temperate regions. In our crowded cities it requires a great
deal of reasoning powers and scientific data, to preserve enough pure
air to prevent actual harm to the inhabitants.
The air which we breathe is made up of about 78J per cent, of
nitrogen, 20£ per cent, of oxygen, .04 per cent, of carbonic acid gas
together with small amounts each, of ozone and aqueous vapor.
Dr. Angus Smith has shown by 109 tests, made in 18 different
places, that the amount of oxygen in the air remains almost constant,
the amount varying between 20.60 in the Met. R. R. tunnel and 20.999 on
the seashore. He also gives two tests, presumably made in the same
theatre, on the same night, with the following results:
Gallery, 10:30 p. M 20.63.'
Pit, 11:30 p. M 20.74.
It was formerly supposed that the inj urious effect was due to car-
bonic acid gas, but more recent physiologists have demonstrated that
this ingredient, so far as the quantities contained in even crowded
apartments are concerned, is neutral. It is the organic effluvia, com-
bined with the diminished supply of oxygen, which causes the harm;
but, as the presence of some of these impurities is very difficult of
detection and requires very delicate chemical tests, and, as their pres-
ence has been proved to be almost directly proportional to the excess of
carbonic acid gas, (C. 02.), the presence of this gas is usually taken as
the criterion of purity.
Pettenkoffer places the maximum limit of C. 02. allowable in the air
of houses, at seven parts in 10,000, while Dr. Parker places it at six in
10,000; but, as before remarked, these limits may be exceeded, and
frequently are, without producing any deleterious effects, if the air
is not, at the same time, polluted by organic impurities. In the air
of soda water manufactories, there is frequently as much as two per
cent, of this gas present without producing any serious inconve-
nience.
An average pair of lungs exhales about .6 cubic feet of C. 0.s per
hour, and, with an allowable maximum of six parts in 10,000, or 0.6 cubic
feet in 1,000 cubic feet, we can easily compute how much air will be
required for any given time. Thus: 1,000 cubic feet of ordinary out-
side air contains 0.4 cubic feet of C. 02., leaving place for 0.2 cubic
feet of C. 02. for each 1,000 cubic feet of air; therefore, 3,000 cubic


The Technic.
feet of air will be required to dilute 0.6 cubic feet of C. 0.2. This put
in symbols is:
T X -6
V =
0.0002
T = time in hours.
V = volume of air required.
The amount of air space, that must be allowed for each person, is
determined by the rapidity with which the air must be changed. With
an " initial air space " of 100 cubic feet and 3,000 cubic feet to be supplied
per hour, the entire volume of air in the room would have to be changed
thirty times per hour. This could not be done without disagreeable
drafts. If all the arrangements for ventilation are perfect, 500 cubic
feet "initial space," which would require a complete change of air six
times per hour, would suffice; but, as the arrangements cannot always
be depended upon, it would be well to allow about 800 cubic feet or,
better still, 1,000 cubic feet. For sick persons this should be about
doubled. In hospitals, therefore, 1,800 to 2,000 cubic feet should be
allowed.
The 3,000 cubic feet of air required for each person, as computed
above, is the amount which would be required to be supplied by a sys-
tem of ventilation, if the room were perfectly air tight, but, as there
are usually cracks and crevices through which the air may enter, the
amount which must be allowed for in ventilation, is usually placed
much lower, and, in fact, only in cases of sickness, or in places where
the arrangements are very unsanitary, is the amount ever exceeded.
The following is a table of the amounts to be allowed for:
Hospitals, ordinary sickness 2119-2472
Hospitals, surgical and lying in cases 3500
Hospitals, during epidemics 3700
Prisons 1800
Workshops, ordinary occupations 2100
Workshops, unhealthful occupations 3500
Barracks, during day 1050
Barracks, at night 1413-1766
Assembly rooms and halls for receptions 2100
Primary schools 250-300
Adult schools 850-1050
Stables 6000-7000
Dr. Angus Smith has devised a method whereby the amount of CO,
in the air may be determined. It is termed "the minimetric test." A
series of six wide mouthed bottles, having capacities of 14,11, 9%, 8, 6J£,


29
and 4% ounces respectively, is fitted with clean, tightly fitting' corks.
The bottles are made perfectly clean and dry, and 3% drams of clear
fresh lime water are put in the smallest and thoroughly shaken. If the
water becomes turbid, there is at least 16 parts in 10000 of C.02 present.
If the water in the largest bottle becomes turbid the proportion is less
than 5 in 10,000. For the intermediate bottles the amounts of C.02
necessary to produce cloudiness are: for the 6J£ g. bottle, 12 parts in 10,-
000; for the 8 g., 10 parts; for the 9% g., 8 parts; and for the 11 g., 7
parts. If, therefore, cloudiness is produced in any of the bottles except
the largest, the amount of C02 present is in excess of the maximum
allowable amount.
The influence of vapor of water upon the air for breathing, is of con-
siderable importance. We all know that the amount of water required
for saturation varies with the temperature of the air, being greater, the
greater the temperature. The quantity of vapor per cubic foot required
for saturation is nearly doubled for each 20° additional temperature.
As the temperature of the air upon issuing from the lungs is that of
the body, or about 98°, it is capable of holding in suspension a much
greater amount of vapor than it had when entering the body at, say 60°,
and it will take up or evaporate from the lungs a much greater amount
than would the same air, at the temperature of the body, and saturated.
As each pound of water thus evaporated from the lungs extracts from
the body about 540 heat units, the breathing of air free from moisture
tends to lower the temperature of the body, and hence, a greater amount
of fuel, and a higher temperature will be required, with a consequent
increase in cost. Air on the sea coast, with a temperature of 60° F., 80
per cent, saturated, contains 4.62 grains of water, while air in the inter-
ior at 70° F., 40 per cent, saturated, contains 3.2 grains. Although the
latter is 10° warmer, it feels cooler than the former, because more than
four times as much heat is lost by evaporation from the lungs than there
is in the former. This explains why the air in England at 55° to 60°
feels warmer than air in America at 70° to 75°.
Again, if air at 0° be taken into a room and heated to 70°, about 8
grains of water will be required per cubic foot to saturate it. It will
tend toward saturation and will remove from the room, furniture, and
wood-work, all the moisture, causing them to crack and warp. Hence,
we see that, from an economic point of view, as well as from a sanitary,
it is best to supply the air admitted to the room in cold weather, with
moisture to an amount which will be mentioned later.
Opposed to all this, is the fact, that the presence of moisture in the


The Technic.
air causes or hastens the decomposition of organic impurities in the air,
and renders it more offensive and injurious than dry air at the same
temperature. It is further estimated that one per cent, of humidity has
as much influence on the condition of the air space when judged by the
sense of smell, as a rise in temperature of 4°. We must, therefore, choose
a mean between dry and saturated air. An amount of humidity of from
15 to 20 per cent, has been found to give no discomfort.
Ventilation is intimately connected with heating, from the facts,
that heat is used as a power for moving machinery whereby the air is
expelled; and by causing a difference in specific gravity between the
inside and outside air, it produces motion and thus aids in its expulsion.
But I shall only mention the different methods of heating, in so far as is
absolutely necessary to explain the systems of ventilation.
In working out a system of ventilation, many things are to be taken
into account. In the case of a theatre, there is the problem of heating
a large hall to the temperature of 60° to 70° while empty, keeping it at
that temperature while full, making a sufficiently close estimate of the
heating capacity of the people present and the lights, furnishing a suffi-
cient supply of fresh air without any drafts, and withdrawing the im-
pure air. An ordinary flat gas burner requires as much air as five per-
sons, and an Argand burner as much as eight persons. If fires are used
we should allow as much for each fire as 100 men would require. It is
estimated that each person will heat 1810 cu. ft. of air, one degree per
hour.
There are three general methods of ventilation:
I. Diffusion and perflation.
II. Aspiration.
III. Mechanical or artificial.
By diffusion is meant the slow entrance and exit of air through the
solid walls and cracks of doors and windows, without the influence of
wind currents. This method is of no importance, as the impure air
contains molecules which are incapable of passing through the solid
walls.
Perflation means the blowing of air through the solid walls. This
would be an efficient means of ventilation if the amount and force of
the wind, and its direction could be regulated, but, unfortunately, this
cannot be done.
The second method, or method by aspiration, depends for it efficiency
upon the difference in specific gravity between the air inside and that
outside the house. This is the best form of ventilation, and the one


31
most commonly used. Only a very few cases need other means be re-
sorted to, if this system is properly carried out.
Of the third method I will speak further on.
Ventilation by windows and doors may also be classed with the
first method. This method is all that is needed in dwelling houses dur-
ing a great part of the year, if the doors and windows are properly
arranged, that is, placed opposite each other; but, during the winter, it
is not safe to open the windows since dangerous drafts may thus be pro-
duced, and the dangers from a cold current are as great as those arising
from imperfect ventilation; for, if the latter brings fever, cholera, and
similar diseases, the former brings colds, rheumatism, bronchitis and
consumption.
In the construction of our houses, too much attention is given to
appearance, sunlight and decoration, while ventilation is scarcely thought
of; or, if thought of, it is not considered of sufficient importance to
justify the expenditure of any extra money upon it: hence, most of our
houses are without any other means of ventilation than those afforded
by doors and windows. This should r/ot be. Outside appearance and
decoration should only be thought of after proper ventilatian has been
provided for.
In houses which have been thus neglected, several simple devices
may be resorted to, for securing fresh air without disagreeable drafts.
The following are recommended by Dr. Vaughan, in "Healthy Homes
and Foods for the Working Classes."
A board three or four inches in width may be fitted under the win-
dow, completely filling the space; this leaves an open space between the
lower and upper sashes, through which the air enters, and is directed
upward between them toward the ceiling, where it spreads out and dif-
fuses itself throughout the room.
A method devised by Dr. W. W. Keen, of Philadelphia, somewhat
resembles this. A short piece of paper or cloth is tacked accross the
lower ten or twelve inches of the window frame. Raising the lower
sash allows the admission of air, which is directed upward by the cloth;
and, at the same time, the opening between the two sashes also serves
for the admission or escape of the air. Here let me remark, that it is a
fallacy to believe as some do, that, if two opening are made, the incom-
ing air will pass through the lower opening, and the outgoing air will
pass through the upper one. This is true to some extent, but there are
many exceptions.
Main's elbow ventilator consists of a couple of pipes, four to six


inches in diameter, passing through a board about ten inches high,
which is placed under the window, and fills the space. The ends of the
tubes turn upward inside, and are provided with valves, by means of
which the amount of air entering may be regulated. Another method
is to bring several tubes through the wall and direct the air upward.
Still another, and perhaps a better method than any of these, is to bring
the air in through pipes to a sheet iron covering around the stove, and
having a space of three or four inches between the stove and the cover-
ing. The heat of the stove creates a draft in the pipes, and at the same
time warms the air before it is poured out into the room.
These methods permit all the air to enter which is necessary, but as
no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time, we must pro-
vide some means of getting rid of the foul air, and, as I am now speak-
ing of houses which are already built and have no system of ventilation
provided for, I will mention one simple way for disposing of it.
Let a pipe be inserted in the chimney below the entrance of the
stove pipe, and having its lower end opening near the floor behind the
stove. The heat of the chimney will produce a sufficient draft to draw
off the foul air. If the chimney does not extend below the opening for
the stove pipe, the ventilator may be connected with the chimney by
means of a collar around the stove-pipe. This method may in some
cases affect the draft of the stove; if it does, a pipe of sheet iron may be
placed in the chimney, connected with the ventilating flue, but entirely
separated from the smoke flue.
When building a house no dependence should be placed on the doors
and windows, but the second method should be used. For dwelling
houses it is hardly necessary to enter into any calculation as to the size
of pipes or chimneys to be used, as the ordinary sizes are usually more
than large enough for this purpose.
The following rules, modified and condensed, from different authors,
should be observed.
The apertures for entrance and escape of air should be placed far
enough apart to secure the thorough diffusion of the air.
When the air is brought into the room through the wall near the
ceiling, it should always be turned upward by some arrangement or
other, so as not to fall upon the shoulders and heads of the persons in
the room and chill them.
The inlets should be numerous and small, to allow a proper distribu-
tion of the air.
The inlet tubes should be short and capable of being easily cleaned.


33
The air must be taken from a pure source, at some distance from the
ground, and not from the back yard near drains and cesspools.
The inlets should be protected on the outside by valves, so as to pre-
vent strong drafts, when the wind blows.
If the air cannot be warmed, it should be admitted near the ceiling;
if it can be warmed, it should be admitted near the floor. No system of
ventilation can be called perfect which admits the air at the same tem-
perature as the outside air.
The air may be warmed by passing it through a furnace, through
steam coils or grates.
In towns or manufacturing districts, the air should be filtered before
allowing it to enter the room. Thin flannel or muslin spread over the
opening answers for a filter.
Outlets should be placed at the highest points convenient, and should
be protected from the weather by corols or other means.
The openings for receiving the air should be placed on the sides of
the house from which the prevailing storms come, to prevent the wind
reversing the currents in the ventilating pipes.
The ventilating pipes should not connect directly with the chimney,
but a pipe entirely separated from the smoke ilue should be built into
the chimney, from which pipes should connect with all parts of the
house, bath rooms and water-closets, as well as with the living rooms.
These pipes ought not to connect with any drain, waste, or soil pipes,
vents of which ought never to enter any chimney.
All large houses should have especial ventilating shafts.
The air should escape higher than it enters, and the higher it
escapes the better.
The incoming air should never have a velocity exceeding three feet
per second.
The area of pipes for admission of air should be larger than the
area of those for its escape.
The outlet pipe should be as near the source of contamination of
the air as may be, and the inlet pipes as far away as possible.
If the air enters at a height of 16 to 20 feet above the floor, and ver-
tically downwards, it should not have a velocity of more than 1} ft. per
second; if it enters laterally, it may have a velocity of three feet per
second.
In the main ventilating chimney, the air should have a velocity of
six feet per second, so as not to be checked by gales.
The outlet pipes which connect directly with the rooms should be


The Technic.
large enough to conduct the air without a velocity of more than three
feet per second.
The pipes from each floor should connect directly with the main
shaft and not with the pipes of the floor above, lest the impure air pass
out into the rooms above.
The following are the temperatures to be maintained under differ-
ent circumstances: For nurseries, asylums, schools, workshops, barracks,
and prisons, 68°; hospitals, 70° to 74°; theaters, assembly rooms, lecture
halls, 76° to 78°. If there are many lights or large gatherings, the tem-
perature may be somewhat less.
For private houses in summer, when no tires are kept, ventilation
by gas jets will be found serviceable. This is simply a gas jet burning in
a ventilating tube. It causes heat enough to create a draft and thus
expels the air.
For public buildings an especial apparatus should be supplied,
heated by steam coils or fire grates, and calculations should be made as
to the amount of air which will be carried off.
Air expands zfo of its volume for each degree Fahrenheit increase
in temperature, or, in other words, for each degree rise in temperature,
the same volume of air is TJT lighter. Thus, if we have a chimney 50 ft.
high, and the temperature within the room is 20° higher than that of the
air without, the difference in weight of the column in the chimney and
that of an equal column of air without, is equal to 50 ft. x -fj&gt;s, or about
2 ft., or the weight of the warm column is equal to that of a column of
cold air, 2 ft. less in height. The warm column will pass upward with
a velocity equal to the velocity which a body under the influence of
gravity would acquire in falling through this difference of 2 feet, or
V 2 g h
V =
1 + F
V = velocity in feet per second.
h = difference in height of two columns.
g = accelerating force of gravity = 32.2 feet per second.
F = coefficient of friction = .3 to .5.
Let us now take as a practical example, an opera house, seating
1,000 persons, burning 100 gas burners, and with a chimney 70 feet high,
and a difference in temperature between the inside and outside air of
10°. We will assume that the heating arrangements have been perfected
so that the temperature may be kept at the proper degree.

As this is far too large a chimney opening we must, by building a
fire at the bottom of the chimney, raise the temperature in the chimney
enough to increase the velocity sufficiently to reduce the area within
reasonable limits. If the temperature be raised to 50° above that out-
side, we will find the area to be 47 square feet or 7 feet square, a result
which is somewhat more reasonable than the other. In some theatres
ventilating shafts are placed above the chandeliers and the heat which
they create is thus utilized. With 833 cubic feet of air per second to be
admitted, and the maximum allowable velocity of entrance of three feet
per second, the area of the admission pipes will have to be 277 square
feet. This area can be obtained by admitting the air from under *he
floors of the different tiers, on which the seats are placed.
When enough draft cannot be obtained by this method without
increasing the dimensions of the chimney to unreasonable limits, resort
must be had to some one of the different mechanical methods.
The different mechanical methods in use are by fans, Arehimediart
screws, pistons and steam jets.
The fan is by far the best of these methods. The velocity of the
current of air from the fan is about three-fourths the velocity of the
extremities of the fan. With the fan we can get almost any velocity,
but with the Archimedian screw the velocity is limited by the friction
between the air and the threads or spirals.
The steam jet is the same as that of locomotives; and cowls, which
are only of use when the wind is blowing, are dependent for their effi-

ciency upon the same principle that a body moving in the vicinity of a
gas, imparts its velocity to the surrounding gas.
The ratio of the cost of ventilation by a chimney, even where extra
fires are kept, especially to create the draft, to that of ventilation by
means of fans or other mechanical arrangements, is about as 1 to 38.
The ventilating fire place invented by Capt. Douglas Galton.is a very
good arrangement for dwelling houses and, if applied on a large scale,
it would, I have no doubt, answer for many public buildings. The air
is received in a closed space, around the fire-place and chimney, where it
is heated, and then poured into the room near the ceiling. The chimney
and fire-place answer for the escape of the impure air. By this means
35 per cent, of the heat is utilized in warming the room, while in the
ordinary "fire-place, only 12 to 14 per cent, is thus utilized.
In the ventilation of workshops and factories the same principles
are to be followed as in the ventilation of dwelling houses and public
buildings, except that, in cases where poisonous fumes or dust are given
off, special arrangements are used to carry it off directly from its place
of origin, and thus prevent its spreading throughout the building.

A RETAINING WALL FOR EARTH,
TREATED GRAPHICALLY.
The preliminary principles on which is based the following construc-
tion for finding the pressure on any bed-joint of a retaining wall for
earth may be somewhat briefly given, if the explanation is limited to
those points only which are needful for the case in hand.
1. If, in the interior of a body, we select a small prismatic portion
whose cross-section is ABC, Fig. 1, and if we know that the stresses on
the faces AC and CB, at right angles, are pressures perpendicular to
those planes and equal in intensity per square inch or square foot, the
pressure on the face AB must be perpendicular or normal to it and of
the same intensity as on the other faces. For, if we multiply the area
of the face AC by the pressure, p, per square foot, and lay it off by scale,
in the proper direction as the force OD, and likewise the area of face
CB multiplied by p as the force OE, the diagonal RO of the rectangle
must give the direction and magnitude of the force on the third face
•The reader will do well to draw this and the following figures to scale for himself.

The Technic.
AB which will balance OD and OE; and, as triangles ABC and ORD are
similar, OR is perpendicular to the face AB, and the intensity of press-
ure on AB will be OR -h AB = 23 *
This case applies to fluid pressure which is always normal to any
plane and of constant intensity for a given depth.
2. If, on the other hand, the force on the side A'C of a similar
small prismatic body A'B'C is of the opposite kind, tension, but of the
same intensity p as before, we must draw OD' in the opposite direction,
and find R'O as the force on the face A' B'. Then, since the triangles
A'B'C and R'D'O are again similar, the intensity of stress on plane
A'B' will still be R'O -+- A'B' = p, but its kind, tension or pressure,
will be that of the line OD' or OE to which it lies the nearer. In the
sketch it is tension, as is evidently necessary to keep A'B' C in equilib-
rium. It will also be seen that the direction of this stress will make the
same angle with the original stresses as in the case ABC, where they
were pressures, but in the opposite direction,—that is, angle R' OE =
angle ROE.
3. Next, if the normal pressures on the two faces AC and OB, Fig; 2
are equal, and we suppose that px per square foot on CB is the greater
and p2 on AC is the less of the two, we may find the direction and in-
tensity of the pressure on the face AB by the following construction:
Let the intensity of the pressure on face CB be divided into two
parts, one equal to % (pt + p}) and the other to % (p -—p,), as indicated
in the sketch. Similarly, the intensity of pressure on face AC may be
divided, as shown, into % (px + p.2) and — yz {px — p2). Then the in-
tensity of pressure on AB to balance the portion % (px + j)2) on CB and
also on CA must be, by § 1., the same, or MO, laid off perpendicularly to
AB. The intensity of stress on AB to balance the remaining portions,
a pressure of % {py — p2) on CB and a stress of — % (i\ —p2), or ten-
sion, on CA must be, by §2., a stress TO or RM of the same intensity,
— K(Pi—J?2),but making an angle equal to SOM with px but in the
opposite direction. The angle NMR corresponds with ROR' of Fig. 1.
This angle can be readily found by taking M as a centre, MO as
radius, and describing an arc OS to cut the line pl, when MS drawn
through S will make OMS an isoceles triangle, and the angle at S will
equal that at 0. Then lay off MR = H(Pi — pt) to satisfy §2. The
resultant pressure on AB will be given in direction and intensity by RO
= p, which is evidently the resultant of RM and MO, since these two
components act on the same unit of area of plane AB. This resulting


39
intensity of stress RO, or p, on plane AB, which balances px on CB and
p2 on AC, makes an angle NOR with the normal NO to its plane.
4. If, for a given pl and p2, any number of planes AB are tried, at
various angles with AC or CB, the triangle OMR, constructed on the
normal to the plane AB, will change its angles and the length of RO,
but not the lengths of RM and MO. Hence the greatest possible value
of the angle MOR will occur when MR happens to be perpendicular to
OR, and that value will give the greatest possible obliquity of the press-
ure on any plane, for given values of pt and p2.
5. If the material under consideration is earth, and it is assumed
to be held in place by the friction alone of its particles, one on the other,
the adhesion arising from moisture being neglected as always uncertain
in amount and sometimes possibly absent, the greatest possible obliquity
of pressure consistent with equilibrium on any plane in the mass of
earth cannot exceed what is known as the angle of repose; for, if it did,
sliding would take place along that plane.
6. Let a plane be passed through P, Fig. 3, parallel to the surface
of the ground DI. The pressure on every square foot of this plane is
vertical, and due to the earth above it, of depth KP. But the prism of
earth resting on a square foot of this plane has a less horizontal cross
section than one square foot and the ratio of the intensity of vertical
pressure on the plane through P to the weight of a vertical column of
earth one square foot in cross-section will be that of the normal PE,
drawn from P to DI, to PK. Hence, revolve PE to PO, and QP will
represent, in feet of earth, the pressure per square foot of the plane
through P parallel to the surface of the ground.
If we knew what and where px and p2 were on such a prismatic
body at P as we have previously considered, the plane previously de-
noted by AB being now the one which passes through P parallel to the
surface of the ground, we could, by §3, lay off on the normal PiVthe
distance PM = % (pt + p2) and MG would be % {px —p2) to close on
GP or p. But, by §5 the greatest obliquity of stress to the normal to
any plane cannot exceed the angle of repose of the earth. Hence, if PI
is drawn making that angle with PN, the distance MG must, if applied
at MO, make MOP a right angle. Therefore find by trial a centre M
from which a semicircle iV670 can be drawn through G and tangent to
the line PI. PM will then be % (pj + p2) and MG = % (p, —p2). By
§3, the direction of px will be parallel to the line ML drawn bisecting
the angle NMG.
7. It may be remarked in passing that PH=p.l and PN=plt acting


The Technic.
on the two right angled faces of the prism at P, respectively parallel
and perpendicular to the direction of the line LM; that p2 is the least
pressure which is consistent with equilibrium, and that it is the one
exerted by earth at rest under the action of its own weight only. Blows
applied to the surface and vibration will probably increase the press-
ures.
8. To find the centre of pressure and the direction and intensity of
pressure on any bed joint of a retaining wall, weighing w' per cubic
foot, pressed at the back by earth of a weight w per cubic foot and of a
given angle of repose,—proceed as follows:
The bed joint is AB, Fig 3, carrying the weight of masonry ABCD,
whose centre of gravity is at T. To find T, draw diagonals AC and
BD; bisect each at 1 and 2 respectively; lay off A-4 = C-5 and B-3
= D-5; connect 1 with 4 and 2 with 3; these connecting lines will
intersect at the centre of gravity T.
9. At a point P, the same distance KP below the surface of the
ground that A is, make the construction of § 6, that is, draw PN per-
pendicular to DI, and PI making with PN the given angle of repose.
Eevolve PE to PB, draw a semi-circle, with centre on PN, through the
point &amp; and tangent to PI. Bisect the angle NMQ by LM.
10. Now find the direction and intensity of pressure A at on the
plane AD, by § 3, noting that A is similarly situated as P. To do so,
draw AQ perpendicular or normal to AD; lay off AQ — PM = % (.Pi +
draw AS parallel to LM, that being the direction of jy, from Q as
centre, with radius QA, draw arc cutting A8 at 8; draw QS and lay off
on it, from Q, MO = QR = % CPX —p2); connect R with A, and RA will
be the direction and intensity of pressure per square foot at A on back
of wall, in terms of cubic feet of earth,—so that, if RA is measured by
the scale of drawing and multiplied by the weight of a cubic foot of
earth, the pressure on back of wall per square foot at A will be given.
As the pressure at back increases regularly with the depth below
surface of ground, the centre of pressure will be at X, one-third of the
slant height from A, and the total earth pressure against one foot in
length of wall will be % {AD X AR).
11. Draw XUW through A, parallel to RA, and let fall TV vertically
through T. Make UV = (A3 + CD) ^ and UW = AR Com-
AD
* The ratio =-=■ may be called unity without serious error, unless the wall has a
strong batter at rear. By the use of the above factors, UV represents weight of wall,
and UW the total earth pressure at back of same.


plete the parallelogram UVYW. UFwill be the direction of the re-
sultant pressure on the bed joint AB, and the point Z where it cuts
the joint will be the centre of resistance or pressure. The total pressure
on the joint will be found by multiplying UY by one half the height of
the wall above AB and by the weight of a cubic foot of earth.
12. If one thinks that the centre of pressure is too near the front
for safety or too near the middle of the joint for economy of masonry,
change the section by drawing DA' or DA" and try again, §§ 8,10 and
11. A second trial will usually suffice.
13. If the distance BZ is more than one-third of BA, the maximum
intensity per square foot, at B, is
2 X total pressure ,„ 3 BZ.
P = AB V-AB)-
If the distan'ce BZ is less than one-third of BA, the maximum in-
tensity, supposing the cement in the joint to offer no resistance to
tension, is
. total pressure
* = BZ
If this intensity is greater than the masonry can safely resist, make
AB wider and try again.
The wall will be satisfactory to many engineers if BZ is somewhat
greater than % AB. A margin of safety is thus left for an increase of
pressure beyond the least pressure here used.
The obliquity of UY to the perpendicular to AB will determine the
possibility of the wall's sliding forward. If such sliding seems likely
to occur, the bed joint AB may be inclined backwards.
The above constructions are simplified when the surface of the
earth is horizontal and also when it slopes at its angle of repose.

LONG DISTANCE DISTRIBUTION OF ELECTRIC
ENERGY.
"When, about the year 1880, the result of a long and tedious series of
experiments was given by Edison to the world, in the shape of his in-
candescent lamp, at almost the same time with the successful lamps of
Swan and others, it was thought by a great many that the problem of
domestic and public lighting was at last distinctly solved, and that the
reign of gas and oil, with their unavoidable and serious disadvantages,


The Technic.
was over forever. But as time went on, though the arc light and even
the incandescent multiplied wonderfully in business quarters, domestic
lighting continued to be carried on in the old manner, save in isolated
cases where a private plant was established to supply one or a few
houses. It is exactly the same with the transmission of electric energy
for motor purposes; in crowded business centres where the energy has
to be sent over but a small distance we find an enormous number of
successfully running motors. During the past year the Sprague Electric
Railway and Motor Co. have had to increase their capacity for manu-
facture several times and have claimed to be unable to supply the de-
mand. Thus we see that, as regards the distribution of power by elec-
tricity to short distances, the problem has been, though not perfectly,
yet successfully and commercially solved. But this can hardly be said
to be true in the case of long distance distribution, though recent very
promising developments have been made along this line, and several
methods have been in use for the past few years, which are claimed to
be practically successful. But, however this may be, they have cer-
tainly not yet secured public confidence, nor even the unanimous ap-
proval of scientific authority.
The great difficulty encountered in attempting to transmit electric
energy to long distances, has been the large cost of conductors. The
expression for the heat energy given out by an electric current travers-
ing a wire is C'R, where C is the current, and R is the resistance of the
wire. Therefore the resistance of the lamp must be made a maximum,
which may be done by increasing the length of the filament and decreas-
ing its cross-section within bounds prescribed by the mechanical prop-
erties of the filament. This limiting condition of maximum mechanical
stability is reached in a lamp of about 200 ohms resistance, so that we
must now decrease the resistance of the conducting line. In the ordi-
nary system, using two main conductors, this could only be done by in-
creasing their cross-section, and, for distances much over half a mile
from the distributing station, the enormous cost of copper thus entailed,
was an effectual barrier to such a path out of the difficulty. Edison,
however, by an extremely ingenious modification of his two wire sys-
tem, managed to decrease the cost of his conductors by 62^ per cent.,
though with the same running expenses and an increased size of plant,
and thus devised a system which is claimed to be a financial success. In
this system, known as the " Three Wire " system, instead of one dynamo
furnishing the two mains with a potential difference of 100 volts, two
dynamos are placed in " series," thus furnishing the mains with 200 volts


43
P. D., while the lamps are connected up between the mains, two in series,
giving each lamp as before a P. D. of 100 volts and therefore the same
amount of light. Now, the fundamental law of resistance is, The resist-
ance varies directly as the length of the conductor, and inversely as its
cross section. Thus if in the two wire system we have twelve lamps,
say, connected up between the mains in "parallel," or side by side, so
that each lamp takes one-twelfth of the total current, instead of the
whole as it would if connected in series, the total resistance will be the
same as if we had one conductor between the mains, of twelve times the
cross section of one lamp or, by the law, the total resistance will be one-
twelfth that of one lamp. In the three wire system, reckoning on the
same basis of twelve lamps, since we now have six rows, of two in a
row, side by side, the resistance of each row being twice the resistance
of one lamp, the resistance of the six rows will be \ X 2 or \ the resist-
ance of one lamp, which is four times the resistance of the lamps as
E
arranged in the two wire system. But, since Current = —-, where E =
R
the electric motive force or P. D., and the P. D. in the three wire system
is 200 volts, while in the two wire system it is but 100 volts, it is obvious
that the current in the three wire system is only one-half that in the
two wire system, thus enabling us to diminish the size of the conductors
since they have not so much current to carry. The Edison Co. reduce
theirs to one-fourth the former size, so as to make the resistance corre-
spond to that of the two wire system, thus saving 62% per cent, in the
cost of conductors while the heat waste, CR, remains the same as before,
since C = % and R = 4 times their former values. This is not the most
economical arrangement, because, as was shown by Prof. H. S. Carhart
in Science for Dec. 12,1884, it does not follow the law first proved by Sir
Wm. Thomson that, "the additional running expenses due to resistance
of conductors, must be equal to the interest on their first cost, for great-
est economy," and that therefore, as Prof. Carhart has shown in the
American Engineer for November, 1884, the cross section of conductors
must vary with the current. According to this law the cross section of
the conductor should be reduced one-half, thus making C'R ■— {%)' 2, or
one-half thaX in the two wire system, instead of the same as Edison
actually makes it. Edison, therefore, saves 62% per cent, in the initial
cost of his conductors, or of interest on their cost, but nothing in heat
waste; if he had made his conductors one-half size he would only save
25 per cent, in interest, but would save 50 per cent in running expenses
due to heat waste, making a total of 75 per cent., or a gain of 12% per


The Technic.
cent, over Edison's plan. That we have gains of 62% per cent, and 25
per cent., instead of 75 per cent, and 50 per cent., is due to the fact that
the three wire system employs a third conductor (from which the name),
about one-half the size of the other two, connecting the medial point of
each series of two lamps, with the medial point between the two dyna-
mos; by this means, if there are more lamps in use on one side of this
medial wire than on the other, as is usually the case on domestic circuits
where lights are continually being turned on and off, there will be a
current established in this third wire, tending to keep the potential be-
tween it and each of the mains uniform, and thus preventing any lam p
from receiving an undue and dangerous P. D. This three wire system
has been extended so as to employ four, or even Ave wires, but the diffi-
culties of regulation in this arrangement have been so great as to
effectually preclude its use to any practical extent. The system has also
been used with 600 volt dynamos substituted for the 100 volt machines,
thus giving a P. U. of 1200 volts, but this has been applied to store lights
almost exclusively. But, after all, with the three wire system we are
only extending our limits a trifle, and are still largely dependent upon
the factor of distance, having to use conductors differing greatly from
each other in size for such small variations in distance as a half mile or
a mile, while it is easy to see that a true system for long distance distri-
bution, ought to be one capable of supplying power at four miles, from
the same circuit and with nearly the same economy, as at three miles.
It has long been the opinion of scientific men, that the only
thoroughly successful method of transmitting electrical energy to a
long distance, would be one in which the energy could be sent out at a
high potential, and transformed into energy of a low potential, at the
various points at which it might be required; and numerous attemps
have been made along this line resulting in two distinct systems, the
"Continuous" and the "Alternating" current transformer systems.
The continuous current has been but little used, and has attracted far
less attention than the alternating system, so that but little can be said
about it. There seems, however, no reason in the nature of things, why
the continuous transformer can not be made as economical and desirable
a system as the alternating. The best known type of continuous cur-
rent transformer systems, those of Edison and of Paris and Scott, con-
sists of a central station supplying a high potential continuous current
to a dynamo having an armature wound with two coils, one of which
carries the high potential current that causes the machine to work as a
motor, and, acting as a dynamo proper, to generate a current in the other


armature coil, thus giving us what might be called a " motor-dynamo"
combination. By properly proportioning the relative number of turns
on the two armature coils, the current supplying the lamps and gener-
ated by the motor-dynamo, can be furnished at any desired potential.
One great advantage of this system is the ease with which motors or
accumulators may be employed on a circuit supplying energy for light-
ing purposes. Other continuous current trannsformers might be men-
tioned, but, as they are comparatively unimportant, it would hardly be
appropriate in a paper of the present limits.
The alternating current system and transformer is probably the most
prominent object of interest and investigation in applied electrical
science at the present day. Although its general thpory is simple and
straightforward, the minor practical difficulties in the way of regulation,
measurement, etc., are innumerable. Only a limited number of plants
are, so far, in use, but from the attention and discussion accorded the
system, and the fear manifested by companies employing the direct
method, one cannot but believe that the system is one which is destined
to success. Essentially, this system employs a central station dynamo
furnishing an alternating current of high potential: this high potential
current is then passed through the primary of an induction coil, thus pro-
ducing currents of alternating directions and low potential in the sec-
ondary. The transformer is really nothing but an ordinary induction
coil reversed; instead of passing the current through a coil of heavy
wire of few turns, and thus inducing high potential currents, in the sec-
ondary coil of fine wire of a great number of turns, the high potential
current is passed through the coil of many turns inducing a low
potential current in the coil of few turns, and we shall, hencefor-
ward, speak of the coil having the greatest number of turns as the
primary and the coil having the smallest number of turns as the
secondary. This current from the secondary is then used to supply the
lamps, using the secondary mains as supply mains, exactly as the two
mains are used in the Edison direct two-wire system. The ratio
between the inducing and the transformed potientials, is determined by
the ratio between the number of turns of wire on the primary and on
the secondary coils of the converter. These converters may be con-
nected in series, so as to make up a "three-wire" system, in a manner
entirely similar to the Edison plan. This " transformer " system was first
introduced by Messrs. Gaulard &amp; Gibbs in London in 1883; their patents
were assigned to Mr. Westinghouse, of Pittsburgh, and combined with
improvements of Mr. Stanley, the Westinghouse Co.'s electrician, form-


The Technic.
ing the "Westinghouse Alternating System," which has been in use now
for about two years. Mr. Slattery has also recently put upon the market
a system, known as the "Slattery Induction System," practically the
same thing as the Westinghouse, differing from it merely in arrange-
ment and form. One of the greatest difficulties with which the alter-
nating system had to cope, was that of proper regulation, so that no
matter how many lamps, within the range of its capacity were used on
any converter circuit, or where they were located, there would always
be a constant difference of potential between the secondary mains.
Gaulard &amp; Gibb's original patent called for a single wire passing from
one terminal of the generating dynamo, through all the primaries of
the converters, and back to the other terminal, the converters being
thus in series. This arrangement, however, proved a failure, and the
converters were finally placed in parallel, i. e. the two primary terminals
of each converter were joined one to each of the high potential mains,
just as the Edison lamps are placed in his two-wire system; this solved
the problem, as had been shown would be the case by Mr. Rankin
Kennedy in 1883. In this way alternations produced in the primary
circuit of any converter affect only the generator, without affecting the
primaries of all the other converters. These converters are made of
different capacities, and are placed according to the needs of any
particular locality, sometimes on street poles between the mains, and
sometimes inside buildings, as in the case of large hotels, factories, etc.
The greatest saving which is made in this system, is in the cost of
conductors, as they can be made very much smaller on account of the
high potential at which the energy is transmitted. The disadvantages
of this system are, however, numerous and serious. In the first place
there is the danger to life and property, which has been attributed to
these alternating high potentials; up to a very late date this was
thought to be even greater than in the case of a direct current of the
same potential, though as to this, electricians are now beginning to
disagree somewhat. In a paper by Mr. T. G. Smith, of the Westing-
house Co., read before the National Electric Light Convention held at
Pittsburgh in February last, he says: "I must mantain that the alternat-
ing current, while it is, in mild doses of from one hundred to two or
three hundred volts, intensely more disagreeable than the direct current
of the same voltage, when it comes to 1000 volts or more, is very much
less dangerous to life. I make this statement with the more confidence,
since I have tried them both and we have in our station here, not one,
but half a dozen cases where our linemen and dynamo men received


47
the full 1000 volts, generally being pretty badly burned at the points
of contact but experiencing no ill after effects, while whenever any of
our men receive a shock from any of our are machines they are nearly
always sick for a day after." Just why one should recover from the
shock produced by the alternating current any sooner than from the
direct, I cannot see, except where a person's body is interposed directly
in the circuit, which is of very rare occurence, most accidents taking
place through a cross, or by means of a "ground." In this case the
great element of danger is not the potential produced by the machine, but
the self-induced, so called "extra current" produced in the field magnets
of the dynamo, the E. M. F. of which is remarkably high, much higher
than that due to the machine itself. This is the cause of the spark
which is produced between the two terminals when the circuit of an or-
dinary voltaic battery is broken, and the E. M. F. is increased in
proportion to the number of turns of wire of the circuit which are
contiguous. In a direct current machine in which some or all of the
current in the external circuit passes through the field magnet coils,
usually of many turns, this induced E. M. F. is something enormous;
in the alternating current dynamo, on the other hand, in almost every
form, the field magnets are excited by an independent dynamo and
circuit thus producing no appreciable extra current in the alternating
circuit when it is broken. However, theory does indicate a reason why
the alternating current should be less fatal than the direct. It has been
supposed by several that death by means of an electric current does not
result so much from the nervous shock, as from an electrolysis of the
tissues or blood, or both, the gaseous products of this electrolysis pass-
ing with the blood to the heart and stopping its action. If this be true,
then the alternating current, though unpleasant, is safe, as the reversals
take place so rapidly that they neutralize each other's electrolytic effect.
As regards danger from fire. Mr. Smith also stated that out of 600 con-
verters, of all sizes, in an unbroken experience of over a year, only
three of them were burned out, and that in these, it was due to loading
the converters beyond their capacity, and simply resulted in blowing out
the safety fuses; I have seen the same thing stated in English journals
regarding lighting in England, where the potentials used are usually as
high as 2000 or 3000 volts. It has also been claimed that the alternat-
ing current mains exercised a disastrous inductive influence upon
neighboring telephone wires, but here also there is disagreement, and
no magnitude can be assigned to this effect.
Thus far we have said nothing concerning the transmission of


The Technic.
energy for mechanical purposes, with reference to alternating currents.
It is here, probably, that the alternating current finds its greatest draw-
back, for it does not, at present at least, allow the use of electric motors
nor of accumulators which may themselves furnish power to motors.
In any station supplying energy for lighting purposes the engines and
dynamos are used but for a small portion of the day to their full capac-
ity, and must stand comparatively idle for the rest of the time, thus
failing to give the proper and maximum return on the investment. If
the plant could be utilized during the whole twenty-four hours, instead
of only during eight or ten of them, the additional running expenses
thus entailed would bear but a very small ratio to the additional profits,
resulting merely from a small increase in the number of employees,
amount of fuel, etc., and none in steam power and dynamos. Thus a
system supplying both lights and motors would have an immeasura-
ble advantage over one which could supply only lights. There are sev-
eral serious difficulties in the way of employing motors on alternating
current circuits. The influence of the induction of the current upon
itself, which, as is known, is greatest when the current fluctuates most
rapidly, is such as to cause the phases of the current, as it passes from
zero through a positive maximum, zero and a negative maximum back
to zero, to lag behind the corresponding phases of the E. M. F. This is

shown in Fig. 1, where II is the curve representing the fluctuations of
E. M. F. of the generator, and I the curve of corresponding changes of
current, the abscissa?, horizontal distances, representing time, and the
ordinates, vertical distances, corresponding values of current and E. M.
F. Since the energy given out by a circuit is EC, and since this product,
for the case represented in Fig. 1, is sometimes + and sometimes —, we
see that part of the time the machine is working as a dynamo, and part
of the time as a motor, and that a decrease in the amount of work done
simply means a shifting of one curve relatively to the other, with very
little decrease of current. Thus, as the work decreases, the heat waste,


CR, remains practically unchanged while in the direct system, where
the current becomes less with the work, the heat waste becomes corres-
pondingly less. Also, the alternating current motor cannot start itself,

as was shown in the following way by Dr. Louis Duncan. Let, in Fig. 2,
A, B and C be the poles of the field magnets of an alternating current
dynamo used as a motor, excited by a continuous current; let the curve
II represent the counter E. M. F. of the motor, and the curve I the
current as before. If the motor moves slowly, there may be several
alternations of the current during the time it takes a coil to move from
A to B, Fig. 3, and thus the product EC will be nearly zero, the + and —
parts being about equal. The armature tends to move first one way and
then another, and there is no resultant force causing it to rotate as a
motor. If, however, the motor can be made to attain aspeed such, that
in the time of an alternation of current a coil shall have moved from
one pole to another, then the motor will continue to work, and Fig. 2
will represent the condition of things. Now, since the product EC is
sometimes + and sometimes —, it is evident that part of the time the
motor is taking energy from the line and part of the time giving energy
to the line, and this latter it can only do by drawing upon its own energy
of motion; in other words, by slackening its speed. The armature will,
therefore, oscillate, and the amount of this oscillation will depend upon
the character of the work which it is doing; if it is driving a train of
wheels having considerable inertia or energy of motion, the decrease in


The Technic,
speed will be but slight. It is obvious, therefore, that the alternating
+ current motor is unfitted for the work of most machine shops, where
greatly varying loads are put upon the power, and where the utmost
uniformity of motion is desired. It might be well to state that, as will
be observed, I have represented the current and E. M. F. as varying in a
curve of sines; this has been found actually to be the law in the case of
circuits having little self-induction, though it seems probable that the
statical action of the transformers may quite change the character of
this curve. Another type of alternating current motor has been sug-
gested, and, I believe, experimentally used by Prof. Elihu Thomson,
depending upon what he calls the "electro-inductive repulsion " between
a conductor and a conducting coil in which there circulates an alternat-
ing current; briefly, this is a repulsion due to the fact that the phases of
a current induced in a conductor by a neighboring conductor carrying
an alternating current lag behind the corresponding phases of E. M. F.,
just as we saw was the case in a single coil traversed by an alternating
current; and since currents in the same direction attract, and in oppo-
site repel, we may see, on drawing curves of the induced and inducing
current for a certain time, that the proportion of time during which
they repel is greater than that during which they attract; we may also
see, from the curves, that during the period of repulsion both the induc-
ing and induced currents have their maxima, while the attracting period
includes only small currents. However, difficulties in the way of the
application of this principle to motor purposes render it probable that
this can never prove a very efficient machine.
But one other system of long distance transmission remains to be
considered, and that can hardly be called a system in the same sense as
the two which we have just been regarding: this is the distribution by
means of storage batteries. The storage battery has never been much
advocated as a system by itself, but mainly as an adjunct to other sys-
tems. The storage battery is a cell which takes advantage of the E. M.
F. produced by electrolysing gases upon the plates of the cell. In the
ordinary sal-ammoniac battery, for instance, the current rapidly dimin-
ishes when the cell is short-circuited, owing to the liberation of hydro-
gen in the chemical reaction which takes place, and the hydrogen being
deposited upon the carbon plate, not only offers extra resistance, but is
the source of an E. M. F. opposing 'that of the battery. In the storage
battery or accumulator we have, essentially, two plates immersed in
some electrolytic liquid through which the current from a dynamo is
passed, so as to place the plates in the same conditions, with reference


to the electrolytic medium in which they are immersed, as are the plates
of a primary battery. A secondary battery is a primary battery after it
has been charged, and we can no more talk of electricity being stored
in the accumulator cells than we can in the case of an ordinary battery.
In both, the plates of the cell stand in such a relation to the liquid by
which they are surrounded that, when the circuit is made, chemical
action is allowed to take place and its energy transformed into that of an
electrical current; there is a storage of potential energy, not of electric-
ity. In the well known Plants or Faure cell, for instance, in which
there are simply two lend pipes covered with P6S04 and immersed in
dilute HJSOi, when the cell is charged by having a current sent through
it, the energy of the current is used in effecting certain chemical changes
within the cell; the result of the reactions taking place is a change of
the Pb3Ot to Pb0.2 at one place, and its reduction to spongy lead at the
other. When the cell is discharged the P602 is changed to PbO and this,
by combining with the ZT2S04, to PbSO^ and the spongy lead is also con-
verted into PbSOt; this change goes on until some or all of the constit-
uents of the cell are exhausted. These secondary cells can be connected
up in series or in multiple arc, as desired, and can be manipulated in
every way just as in the ordinary voltaic cell. They can also be trans-
ported, after charging at some central station, to different places at
which they may be required, and can be economically used in this man-
ner in cases where there are a few lights to be supplied in districts in
which it would not pay to ran lights from the station. They can also
be advantageously used for elevators, street railways, train lighting, etc.
But, as applied to station lighting, it has been the idea to have a main
central station, itself having a lighting capacity, which should use its
dynamos during the day to charge at a high potential, accumulator cells'
arranged in series, and placed at various sub-stations. At night these
sub-stations could themselves be used as centers of distribution, the
accumulators being now connected up in parallel. Or, these batteries
may themselves be coupled up at the central station and used exactly as
the dynamos are.
But, after all, there can be no real comparison between these differ-
ent systems. Each is good in each place, and perhaps the best general
system is a combination of all. For distances less than or not much
above one mile, the three-wire system is probably the most economical;
for distances up to two miles there may be no appreciable difference,
but for greater differences the alternating or some transforming system
is the only system which can be used. In large cities where property is


The Technic.
very valuable the alternating has an immeasurable advantage over the
three-wire system, as the former can afford to locate on the suburbs
where land is cheap, while the Edison, as they themselves admit, must
be in the center of their system in order to make it pay. The alternat-
ing system can reach customers that the three-wire system never can.
Much more might be said, and most worthily too, upon this very
interesting and important subject, but space forbids. I have tried in
these few pages to indicate the principal features, pro and con, of the
several systems before the world at the present day, without trying to
formulate an argument for any particular system. All are practical-
there is no doubt of that; as to which is most so only longer study and
experiment can tell. . Elmer G. Wtllyoung, '88.
DYNAMICS OF RECIPROCATING ENGINES.
The problem of the forces which exist in reciprocating engines has
many points of interest not usually considered by engineers. It is cus-
tomary to consider that the pressure on the piston is transmitted un-
changed, or only slightly modified by the angularity of the connecting-
rod, to the crank-pin, and the moving parts are designed with reference
to this pressure.
It is the purpose of this paper to consider the forces to which the
crank-pin is subjected, and to show graphically the effect of the angu-
larity of the connecting rod and of the acceleration of the reciprocating
parts, viz: the piston, piston-rod, cross-head, and the unbalanced part of
the connecting-rod. The discussion will be confined to horizontal
engines, and the effect of friction will be neglected as it is such a varia-
ble quantity. The application to vertical engines may be easily made
when the action of the horizontal engine is fully understood. The prob-
lem will be treated by considering
First, The effort in the connecting-rod, and its effect in producing
rotation of the crank.
Second, The pressure required to accelerate the reciprocating parts,
and the resultant effort producing rotation of the crank.
Third, The variation in rotational effort for which the fly-wheel
is provided.
First, The Connecting-rod Effort and the Rotational Effort.—-It will


53
be simpler to consider, first, an engine in which the connection between
the piston and crank is straight, that is, a yoke or slot connection instead
of a connecting-rod. Later the first will be spoken of as an infinite con-
necting-rod and the latter as a finite connecting-rod.
With the yoke connection the pressures on the piston are transmit-
ted in parallel lines for all positions of the crank.
In Fig. 1, let O be the center of the circle described by the crank-pin
C, and OC any position of the
crank making an angle 9 with
the line of centres. The diam-
eter of the circle, A' B' is
equal to, and for our purpose
will represent, the stroke of
the piston. Let Pi = the FlG-
effort on the piston acting on the crank-pin in the line Y C. Pi may be
resolved into two forces, P V acting radially, and C T acting tangen-
tially. The second produces rotation, and will be referred to as the tan-
gential effort; the first produces friction only and is lost so far as turn-
ing the engine is concerned.
If Pi is taken to a scale, then the values of the tangential and radial
efforts may be measured directly.
It is more convenient, however, to determine the tangential effort
by taking from the center 0 a perpendicular OM upon the line of action
of the force Pi produced.
Denoting the tangential effort by Ti and the radius of the circle by
r, and taking moments about O, we have
whence
Ti • r = Pi • 0 M..
Pi • U M
Ti =
.(1).
..(.2).
If r be taken to a scale = Pi, then Ti = O M. Taking Cc perpendic-
ular to A' J?',wehave2'i = OM = Cc = r sinee (3); or the tangential
effort is represented by the sine of the crank angle, and is equal to it
when Pi — r.
If now the case of a connecting-rod is considered, let H C represent
the line of action of the force, making an angle a and with the line of
centres. Produce H C and from 0 drop upon it the perpendicular 0 iV.


The Technic.
Let Pf and Tt denote the connecting-rod and the tangential efforts
respectively ; then as before
Tt-r = Pf 0 N (4).
whence
Pf 0 N
Tt = (5).
and if r be taken = Pf, then Tt = O N.
As will be seen the connecting-rod has the effect of increasing the
tangential efforts in the first and fourth quadrants, and of decreasing
these efforts in the second and third quadrants.
The value of Pt may be found by multiplying by the secant of the
angle a, or P = Pi sec a (e).
For usual ratios of connecting-rod length to crank the value of
P is from 1.015 P to 1.03 Pi when the connecting-rod and crank are
at right angles, being of course equal to Pt at the ends of the stroke.
It is unimportant to consider this difference in practice except when
the connecting-rod is short relatively to the crank. It may then be use-
ful to know the efforts in the rod for each position of the crank, and
these efforts may be found graphically as follows:
Fig 2.
In Fig. 2 let A B C D represent an indicator diagram from an engine
in which the steam follows full stroke, and A B C e /, one from an
engine cutting off at e.
Let h be the position of the piston, h c the connecting rod and c the
crank-pin, describing the crank circle on the diameter A' B '. The ordi-
nate hp represents the pressure against the piston lor the assumed posi-
tion. Produce h p and erect j I perpendicular to the connecting-rod,
intersecting h p produced in /. Take j k — h p and draw k p' parallel


to h c; then h p' will represent, to the same scale as h p, the pressure in
the connecting-rod. For, taking moments about I we have
Ih
Pi - Ih = Pt • Ij, whence Pt = Pi. — (7);
U
Ih hp' hp1 hp'
by similar triangles — = — = —; or, Pt = Pi — .... (8).
Ij Jk hp hp
But Pi — hp, therefore Pf = hp'. In the same way for the pressure
hq against the piston, the pressure hq' exists in the connecting-rod.
The dotted diagrams represent the indicator diagrams as modified by the
connecting-rod. As before stated this calculation may be neglected
except in extreme cases. The full effect of this modification is not trans-
mitted to the crank-pin, as it is offset in part by the friction of the
engine.
Having no w a simple method of finding the tangential efforts for each
position of the crank and corresponding position of the piston, it
becomes easy to show by a diagram the tangential efforts for an entire
revolution*
In Fig. 3 let the upper part represent indicator diagrams in which
A B is the stroke, A C D B A, a diagram following full stroke, and A C
EFBA,&amp; diagram following part stroke. Consider first the diagrams
shown by full lines. Divide the diagram into the usual ten equal
spaces and erect in the middle of the spaces the ordinates numbered
from 1 to 10. Each ordinate will represent the pressure against the pis-
ton for the space in which it stands, and the average of these ordinates
will of course represent the average pressure against the piston for an
entire stroke. On the diameter A' B' = A B, describe the crank circle,
and project the ordinates as shown, cutting A' B', also the circumference,
in the points numbered from 1 to 10. Through these latter points of
division draw the radial lines sx tt, s2 f2 s10 tw . With a radius Os
= AC — the uniform pressure for the full stroke diagram, describe the
semi-circle*sl st *i0. This last circle is called the radial diagram of
pressures for full stroke. It amounts of course to taking the ordinates
from the indicator diagram and laying them off from the centre 0 on the
radial lines which, to avoid confusion, have not been drawn from the
centre to the circle s, s2 &amp;c; that is, Oslt Os3 &amp;c, are taken equal to
ordinates 1, 2 &amp;c, of the indicator diagram.
•The radical and tangential diagrams used in this paper were originally presented
by Mr. Arthur Kigg, in England, in 1870. See "A Practical Treatise on the Steam
Engine," by Kigg.


The Technic.
Fig. 3.
If from the points st ss s3 &amp;c, perpendiculars be dropped upon the line
of centres A' B' , these perpendiculars will, as already shown, represent
the tangential efforts for the corresponding crank positions with an infi-
nite connecting-rod.
Now take these perpendiculars and lay them off outside the crank
circle, considered as a base circle; that is, take ltlt 2tv 3t,..,. 10tm equal
respectively to the perpendiculars upon A' B' from s1,si.... s10, and
connect the extremities by the curve A' t2.... t10 B'; this line is


known as the curve of tangential efforts, and shows at a glance the turn-
ing effort for all positions of the crank from the beginning to the end of
one stroke. The curve for the return stroke with an infinite connecting
rod [not shown] would be identical with that for the forward stroke.
Considering the diagram in which steam follows with full pressure
through CE and expands through EF, the radial diagram becomes
sl s2 ss $i s'5 s'e s'10, and the sines or perpendiculars being
drawn and laid off as before give the tangential diagram A' t, t2 ts tt
t' t' t' R'
The indicator diagrams thus far considered are ideal, and are never
fully realized in practice. The dotted diagram shown for the return stroke
is modified to represent more closely actual practice, the corners at e,f, g,
and hb being rounded for practical reasons; the back-pressure line ga
lies above AB by an amount equal to the back-pressure. It will be evi-
dent that as steam pushes the piston on one side with a pressure varying,
as shown by the line c efg, the piston pushes or expels the steam from
the cylinder on the other side with a pressure varying, as shown by the
line a h h' b'; therefore, the useful pressure will be the difference
between the ordinates of these lines, becoming negative where they cross
at /. In the lower half of the crank circle, then, construct the
radial diagram st s2.... sw by taking the difference of these pressures.
Where the expansion line eg crosses the compression line h' b', the press-
ures on the two sides of the piston are equal, and the radial diagram
passes through the center O. From this point to the end of the stroke
the back pressure is greater than the forward pressure, and the radial
diagram continues as shown.
By erecting the perpendiculars and laying off outside of the base
circle, as before, we get the tangential diagram B' t10 t,.... f, A'.
Between (2 and tx it passes inside the base circle, showing that instead of
a rotational effort driving the crank, the crank drives or pulls the piston.
The diagram, then, shows at a glance the effect of efforts on the
piston in turning the crank; and all being constructed to a scale, quan-
tities may be measured with as much accuracy as the original indicator
diagrams.
If preferred a straight line may be used instead of the base circle,
the tangential efforts being laid off on ordinates spaced the same as on
the circle, at right angles to the base line.
The mean tangential effort may be found by dividing the tangential
diagram into equal spaces on the base circle, drawing radial ordinates,
and averaging the same as the indicator diagram; or it may be

found as follows: the useful work done on the piston is of course equal
to the useful work done on the crank-pin. While the piston travels the
length of its stroke A B, the crank-pin travels the length of the semi-
circle oni' B'.
It 7T
This latter length = A' B' — = AB — = 1.5708 AB (9).

Let p equal the mean effective pressure per sq. inch against the pis-
ton for a stroke, found by averaging the ordinates of the indicator dia-
gram and multiplying by the scale of the diagram, and t, the tangen-
tial effort corresponding to p, then
p • A B = 1.57 AB .t whence « = —.... (10).
1.57
The total mean effective pressure and the total mean tagential effort
will of course be found by multiplying^) and t by the area of the piston.
The value of t may be laid off from the base circle to the proper
scale and a circle drawn through it from centre O; this circle is called
the circle of mean tangential effort. Figs. 5,14 and 16 show these cir-
cles. The variations outside and inside of this circle should be small to
give uniform speed with a light fly-wheel.
In Fig. 4 the tangential diagrams of Fig. 3 are reproduced in full
lines, and the dotted lines show the effect of considering the angularity
of the connecting-rod. The construction is as follows: c, 1, c2 2, c3 3 ....
c8 8. c9 9, c,„10 are positions of the connecting-rod corresponding to the
crank positions 1,2,3 ... .8,9,10. Through the points «„ s„s3 ss, s9,
s10 in the radial diagram, corresponding to the given crank positions,
draw the lines s, Nlt s2 Nlt s3 N3.... ss Ns, s9 iV9, s10, N10 parallel to the cor-
responding positions of the connecting-rod. From the center O upon
these lines drop the perpendiculars ONly ON~t, OIfs ONa, ONa, ON10.
These perpendiculars, as already shown, will be equal to the tangential
efforts, and should be laid off from the base circle instead of the sines.
The same construction follows for the return stroke shown in the lower
half of the circle.
Only a few points are shown to avoid confusing the diagram. Thus
far only a single engine has been considered; but the same construction
may be applied to an engine with any number of cylinders, care being
taken to reduce all of the diagrams to the same scale before combining,
considering not only the scale of the indicator diagrams, but also the rela-
tive sizes of the cylinders. For example, take a two-cylinder compound


Fig. 4.
engine with the condensing cylinder twice as large as the non-condensing
cylinder. Let the scale of the indicator diagram from the first be 20 lbs.
to the inch, and from the latter, 60 lbs. to the inch; then the tangential
efforts of the non-condensing cylinder will need to be multiplied by the
.fraction %. This may be conveniently done by the use of proportional
dividers. In referring the tangential diagram to a common base circle
preparatory to combining, care should be taken that no error be made
in the relative positions of the diagrams.
Fig. 5 shows a pair of diagrams worked up for the U. S. S. Quinne-
baug.
These engines are two-cylinder compound, the dimensions being
42 ins. and 64 ins. diameter, and 42 ins. stroke. The condensing cylinder
is 90° ahead of, or 270° behind, the non-condensing cylinder. The dia-
grams represent the engines doing 1102.891. H. P., or 590.03 for the non-


condensing, and 512.86 for the condensing cylinder; 61 revolutions were
made per minute, with a boiler pressure of 78 lbs. per sq. in., and a vac-
uum of 19 ins. The scales of the diagrams were 40 and 20 lbs. to the
inch, but as they have been reduced to two-thirds full size, the scales
have been marked 60 and 30 lbs. to the inch. The circular and tangen-
tial diagrams were made separately and then conbined, as shown in the
figure. Light full lines indicate the non-condensing, and dotted lines,
the condensing cylinder diagrams, the heavy full line the combined
diagram. The circles of mean tangential efforts are marked as shown.
The hatched portions outside and inside of the combined mean tan-
gential effort circle show the variation of the tangential efforts.
The diagram will be clear without further explanation, and it will be
apparent that the maximum tangential effort for which the shaft and
crank must be designed may be easily located, and measured with accu-
racy. Frequently, surprising irregularities are found by the use of the
diagrams as explained; but more surprising will the irregularities be
found when the effect of acceleration is considered.
Second, The Efforts as Affected by Acceleration of the Reciprocating
Parts.—Thus far only the tangential efforts have been considered, and
these unaffected by disturbing influences other than those due to the angu-
larity of tho connecting-rod. We will next consider the effects of accel-
eration and retardation of the reciprocating parts.
As before, first consider an engine with an infinite connecting-rod,
and in Fig. 6 let 0 be the center of a crank circle described on A B' as a
diameter. Take the crank OC, making any -W
angle e with A'B', and draw YC and CV A\
to represent direction of piston and tan- _j-
gential efforts respectively. Erect the per- ~* * /j\

In Fig. 7, take the circle with diameter divided into equal spaces
and numbered as before. Erect ordinates cutting circle in points Cx c2 ...

These horizontals, or cosines, will be proportional to the accelerations
corresponding to the different crank position's; if the velocity be taken
equal to the radius, then these cosines will be equal to the accelerations,
in which case the lower half of the figure may be constructed by trans-
ferring with the dividers these cosines, and setting them off from the
line A' B' as shown. The line a 6 is the acceleration line,

our case represents the weight of the reciprocating parts. In practice it is
more convenient to reduce this weight to the equivalent weight per
W
square inch of piston area, or w = —, where A = area of piston. In ordi-
A
nary cases the value of w varies from 2.5 lbs. to 5 or 6 lbs. As an exam-
ple take an engine 10 ins. diameter, and 12 ins. stroke, making 300 revolu-
tions per minute, with a value of w = 3 lbs.
300 X 2 ^ 3 X 31A1
V = = 31.416 ft. per second, and y = = 91.8 lbs., or a
60 32. 2 x 1
pressure of 91.8 lbs per sq. inch is required to start the reciprocating
parts from rest, assuming no friction; and an equivalent pressure
is given out at the end of the stroke.
If w = 2 lbs., the pressure for acceleration becomes % X 91.8 = 61.2
lbs. per sq. inch. If the revolutions are 200, the pressure becomes (iftft)2 X
91.8 = 40.8 lbs. per. sq. Inch., and with 100 revolutions the pressure be-
comes dW'' X 91.8 = 10.2 lbs. per sq. inch.


In Fig. 8 let A C B B A be
an indicator diagram follow-
ing full stroke. Take C a
equal to the pressure required
for acceleration at the begin-
ning of the stroke = B b the
equivalent pressure due to re-
tardation at the end of the
stroke. Draw a b cutting
C B in 0. Then the effective
pressure against the piston at
the beginning of the stroke is
AC — C a = A a, and at the
end of the stroke, B B + B b =
B b, while at the middle of the
stroke it remains unchanged.
During the first half of the
stroke work represented by the

The Technic.
triangle C 0 a has been done in accelerating the reciprocating parts, and
during the second half, work represented by the equal triangle D Ob has
been done by the reciprocating parts, the total work remaining un-
changed.
With a higher speed let C a' = D b' =. the pressure for acceleration
and retardation. Then at the beginning of the stroke there is no effec-
tive pressure against the piston, and at the end the pressure is twice as
great as the indicator diagram shows. Any increase of speed beyond
this point gives a negative pressure at the beginning of the stroke, as
shown by the line a" 6''. From A to c there is a pull on the reciprocat-
ing parts by the crank, this pull changing to a push by the steam after
passing c. Attention need now scarcely be drawn to the fact that the
pressure for which the moving parts of engines are usually designed
may be far from the correct pressure. It is also evident that in general
the reciprocating parts should be made as light as is consistent with
strength, and the number of revolutions should not be increased unduly.
An engine that runs quietly and smoothly at one speed may be noisy
and give trouble at a different speed.
"With slow speed engines, and with engines having relatively long
connecting-rods, the solution given is sufficiently exact for practical
purposes; but with high speed engines, and with engines having rela-
tively short connecting-rods, the following solution becomes necessary.
Consider an engine with a finite connecting-rod
Fig. 9.
and in Fig. 9 take the crank circle as before, and draw the connecting-
rod HC, producing it to M. Draw VM perpendicular to HM, and cC
and ON perpendicular to A'B'. Let A B be the stroke of the engine,
and let the piston be at H. Let V = CV = the tangential velocity of
the crank-pin, and v = velocity of piston or cross-head, a = angle made
by connecting-rod with line of centres, 8 = crank angle, * = OCM =
CVM. Denote the lengths of connecting-rod and crank by I and r
respectively.

While the crank has moved from A1 to C through the angle 9, the
piston has moved from A to H. The ratio of the velocity of the piston
■» to the velocity of the crank-pin V may be found by projecting each
velocity upon the direction of the counecting-rod, which, being a rigid
body, must contain equal components of the velocities in the direction
of its length. Therefore
v cos a = V sin * .... (13).

infinite connecting-rod, v = V sin e, we see that the additional effect of
a finite rod is determined by the fractional term which is expressed with
only the crank angle as a variable.

The Technic.
In Fig. 11 indicator diagrams are shown, one in full lines, the other
dotted, with the acceleration
lines for both the infinite and
the finite rod. For conven-
ience, these lines are drawn
with reference to the lower
line of the diagram. The
portions of the diagram be-
tween these lines and the up-
per line of the diagram show
the effective pressures
against the piston in the two
cases. The effect of the finite
rod is to lessen the effective
pressure on the piston at the
beginning and end of one
stroke, increasing it in the
middle, and vice versa for
the return stroke. For still
g r e ater clearness the effect-
ive pressures are laid off with
FlG- u- reference to a baseline 4X 2?,
where by full lines and dotted lines they are shown, the arrow heads
denoting direction of piston's motion. The difference is very marked.
Fig. 12 shows the effect of acceleration with short cut-off and high
speed. The effective pressures
are laid off with reference to A
B. There is a slight pressure
driving piston from A to d, a
negative effort or pull from d
to e, and a positive effort from
e to the end of stroke. The
changes at d and e sometimes
cause a peculiar noise, if the
bearings are at all worn, which
the engineer is often at a loss
to account for. With increased
load and longer cut-off the
noise disappears. Automatic Fla-12,
engines starting without load frequently pound in such a way.


Figs. 13,14,15 and 16 are diagrams from a "Straight Line Engine"
of the following dimensions:*
Diameter of cylinder, 11 ins., stroke, 16 ins., length of connecting-rod,
51 ins., diameter of fly-wheels, 60 ins., face, 8% ins., weight of fly-wheels,
4000 lbs., weight of piston and rod, 100 lbs., weight of cross-head, 122 lbs.,
weight of connecting-rod, 150 lbs. Of the weight of the connecting-rod
100 lbs. is considered rotary and balanced in the fly-wheel, leaving 50 lbs.
as reciprocating. The total weight of the reciprocating parts is then
W 272
W = 100 + 122 + 50 = 272 lbs., whence w = — = = 2.86 lbs.

The indicator diagrams in Fig. 13 were taken when the engine was
running empty. The revolutions were 240 per minute. A is the head
end, and B the crank end. The spring used was 40 lbs. to the inch, but
as the diagrams have been reduced to two-thirds full size the scale is
marked 60 lbs. to the inch. The pressure per sq. inch to start the recip-

be added — X 37.51 = 5.88 lbs. And 37.51 + 5.88 = 43.39 lbs., required
51
to start the reciprocating parts from rest; and 37.51 — 5.88 = 31.63 lbs. to
bring them to rest again at the end of the stroke. The pressure for the
crank end diagram would be a little greater as the area of the piston-
rod decreases the area of the piston; but it may without serious
error be considered the same. A circle may now be described with a
radius = 37.51 lbs. to a scale of 60 lbs. to the inch, as in Fig. 10, and
the points d,o,e found by taking Oo = Dd — Ee = 5.88 lbs. to the same
scale, and describing the arc of the circle doe. The diameter and cir-
cumference being divided the same as the indicator diagram, the hori-

return stroke, in the same way, may be found the line r' s t' u'. On both
strokes the piston efforts become negative at the points t and V. The
ordinates of the lines r s tu and r' st' u' may now be transferred to the
lower figure giving the radial diagram s SjSgO *9 sa and *0 se 0 s2 st&gt; for
the forward and return strokes respectively. Prom these radial diagrams
the tangential diagrams A' MQ1S B' andB' N' P M' A' are found.
The mean tangential effort circle may be found by formula, or by aver-
aging ordinates, as already explained. An inspection of the figures shows
a.positive turning effort from A' toiV, and a negative turning effort
from IftoB'. On the return stroke it is positive from B' to M' and
negative from M1 to A'.
Fig. 14 shows diagrams worked up for the engine under a heavy
load. The revolutions in this case were 234 per minute. The construc-
tion for the different diagrams is the same as in Fig. 13. A slight nega-
tive tangential effort should appear at the ends of the stroke. Consid-
erable difference is shown to exist in the turning efforts for the two
strokes, although from the indicator cards it would not be so apparent.

Figs. 15 and 16 show results for the engine under normal load mak-
ing 235 revolutions per minute. In Fig. 15 the acceleration lines are re-
ferred to A B, and the lines of effective piston efforts to a line below
(not lettered). The radial diagrams of effective piston efforts, and the
tangential diagrams in Fig. 16 will be clear from previous constructions.
The mean effective pressure found by averaging the two indicator
diagrams is 26.94 lbs.; and this multiplied by twice the stroke equals the
work done in one revolution by one sq. inch of piston area, and it also
equals the work done in one revolution on the crank-pin; or
— 26.94
26.94 X 2 AB- = ptirXA'B'; whence pt = = 17.16 lbs.,

for the mean tangential effort. This quantity laid off to the scale of 60
lbs. from the base circle gives the dot and dash mean tangential effort
circle shown in Fig. 16.
Third, Fly- Wheels— The relation of the work already done to the com-


The Technic.
putation for the fly-wheel is very simple. The object of the fly-wheel is to
regulate speed, and it accomplishes this object by taking up, or absorbing,
the surplus energy in one part of a revolution and giving it out again in
another part where there is a deficiency, this being accomplished by a
change of speed. For instance, in Fig. 16, from M to N, or through 99°
there is an excess of power as shown by the irregular figure MQN; from
_ZVtoiV',or through 80.5°, there is a deficiency of power, or excess of
resistance, as shown by the figure NB'N'. Again there is an excess of
power from N' to M' through 90°, and a deficiency from M' to M
through 90.5°.
These excesses and deficiencies may be reduced to foot-pounds
as follows: The average excess of tangential effort from M to N is
99
15 lbs. The angle is — x 2"= 1.73,and the crank radius is % of a foot;
360
therefore the excess is 15 x 1.73 x 0.67 = 17.3 ft.-lbs.
In the same way we may find the excess or deficiency for other frac-
tions of the revolution, when all may be grouped in a table as follows:
Power. Resistance.
I. Excess through 99° 17.30
II. Deficiency" 80.5° 11.80
III. Excess "90° 9.06
IV. Deficiency" 90.5° 14.54
26.36 26.34
2
The work for one revolution is equal to 17.16 X ^ X ir = 71.91
ft. lbs. per sq. inch. Therefore, the excess of power, or of resistance, in
one revolution is = 0.366 of the whole energy; and this fluctuation
must be provided for by the fly-wheel. It is customary, however, to
provide a fly-wheel that will care for the maximum fluctuation of
energy, and this will of course give lesser variations of speed for the
lesser fluctuations of energy.
For instance, during the fractions of the revolution numbered land
II, the excess of power is 17.30 ft. lbs. and the total energy per sq. inch
71 91
of piston for that portion of a revolution is —~- = 35.95 ft. lbs.; there-
fore, the excess of power for one-half revolution is = 0.481 of the
total energy for one-half revolution. To design the fly-wheel for this
fluctuation will give closer regulation in other parts of the revolution.


The area of the piston equals 95 sq. inches, and 95 X 17.30 = 1643.5 ft.
lbs. for the total excess, which we will call A E.
In practice we may consider the rim of the fly-wheel as the govern-
ing weight, neglecting the arms and hub.
If, then, a fly-wheel rim of weight W change in velocity from Vx to
Y% ft. per sedond, the energy represented by the change will equal
W W
— (V,* - = — (F, + 7,) (F, - F,) •= A E. But V, + V, = 2V =
2g 2g
twice the mean velocity, and V,— F, = the difference between the great-
ly 2g A E mg A E
est and least velocity = —; therefore W = = , the usual
m V V*
2Vx —
Rankine formula. m
The outside diameter of the fly-wheels of the engine under consid-
eration is 5 feet. Assume the mean diameter = 4.75 feet. The engine
is intended to run at from 180 to 235 revolutions per minute. In our
calculation assume 180 revolutions; then the mean velocity V =
180x 4 60X 31416 = 44,77 feet per second- rphe COf,flicient m may vary
from 25 to 100 or more. Assume it equal to 80, then
W= 80&gt;&lt; 32-2 X 1643-5 = 21131b3.
(44.76)»
This weight is that needed to control the engine against its own vari-
ations of load. The fly-wheels together weigh about 4000 lbs., which
enables the engine to care for a considerable variation of external load.
Fly-wheels should, however, be placed as near the variable load as possi-
ble. Between full load and the friction load the engine varied from 235
to 240 revolutions per minute. But this change of speed was not due to
fluctuation of energy, but simply to the fact that an increase of speed
was necessary to throw the governor weights out far enough to control
the valve for the new point of cut-off. The diagram for the fly- wheel
may, if preferred, be constructed with reference to a straight base line
of length equal to the circumference of the base circle, the same as sug-
gested for tangential efforts, but the method presented is convenient,
and gives the designer a more perfect idea of the points in the revolu-
tion where the variations occur. M. E. Cooley.

BLUE-PRINTING.
The idea of this paper is not to give a general view of printing
processes, but a practical idea of the blue process, the one most fre-
quently used for reproducing drawings.
First, then, as to the materials. Soluble citrate of iron and am-
monia, and red prussiate of potash, when dissolved in water and mixed,
make a mixture which becomes permanently blue when exposed to the
action of light. Quickly in bright sun-light, ana more slowly in diffused
light. If shut entirely from the light, it may be kept indefinitely with-
out much change. The blue is the familiar Prussian blue, and is chem-
ically Fet {Fe Cye\ (Ferrous-ferri-cyanide). It is insoluble in water or
acids. The materials are usually mixed in proportion of % oz. of citrate
in 4 oz. of water, and % oz. Prussiate in 4 oz. of water, making eight
ounces of solution. These proportions may have to be varied. When
spread on the paper the material should be a light straw color. If too
brown it indicates that the'citrate is too strong, and must be used more
sparingly.
The paper to be used must be unsized so that it will dry without
warping after having been thoroughly soaked in water. It should be
moderately heavy, as light paper becomes permeated by the solution,
and when printed shows cloudy spots. In my own limited experience,
the best results were obtained from Hyperion Satin paper. (Luhring &amp;
Dietzgen, 115 Dearborn St., Chicago. $10.50 per 100 yards, 27 inches
wide).
The printing apparatus is usually a plate of glass, capable of being
firmly pressed down on a flat, even backing, padded preferably with
flannel. For a large sheet it will be necessary to use plate glass; and if
a good southern exposure is available, its own weight, aided by that of
the frame in which it is held, will be sufficient. A print much larger
than the frame may be made as follows: Prepare a piece of paper longer,
say six inches, than the drawing, spreading it at one operation as it is
more likely to be uniform. Cut it in two and print one half, noting the
time of exposure. Expose the second half the same length of time
immediately after, the light being about the same. Leave the pieces the
same length of time in the bath, and with a little practice they can be
made of exactly the same shade, and will overlap about three inches
when the drawing is made to " register." Lay them on a table, register


77
them by means of pins put through the same point on the drawing on
the overlapping parts of the prints. Fasten with thumb tacks an inch
or two from the proposed line of section, and with a sharp knife cut at
once through both pieces, in a straight line. Take out the waste pieces,
and a strip half an inch wide well covered with mucilage will be found
an efficient butt-strap. Let it dry before drawing the tacks. Professor
Thurston, in a paper recently read before the Am. Soc. of Mech. Eng. at
Nashville, Tenn., gives methods of printing large tracings. One is, to
use a large cylinder, on which the tracing is to be wrapped. 1 n strong
light it will be necessary to keep this turning, as otherwise the print
would not be even in intensity. Another is to tack the paper and
tracing on a broad flexible board, and stretch it by bending the board
slightly, the tracing on the convex side; or bend it slightly and put the
tracing on the concave side, stretching it by allowing the board to
straighten.
The washing tank may be of any convenient size or form. One
draughtsman met with contented himself with laying his print on a board
and throwing water on it from a hose. The print was clear enough, but
was scarcely worth the time. Dealers in supplies prefer to sell you a zinc
trough, as it is somewhat expensive. None could give better satisfac-
tion than the one here described. About 3 ft. by 5 ft. 6 in., by 4 in.;
made of white pine, put together with screws and white lead; a waste
pipe in the bottom of one corner, stopped by a hollow plug a little less
in length than the depth of the tank, so that it can be used as an over-
flow as well as for emptying the tank in order to change the water. The
water is kept flowing continually and the tank never becomes foul.
Now, as to the operations: Having dissolved the materials sepa-
rately in water, mix them and allow the mixture to stand at least 12
hours before using. If used immediately, the print will be light in
color, and no amount of washing will prevent it from changing after-
wards—becoming darker, though not uniformly so. Spread the paper
on a board in the "dark room," and apply the mixture in quantities just
sufficient to spread well over the paper. The best thing for spreading it
is a thick calcimining brush, not very stiff as to the bristles. It should
be dampened with water before using, so as not to soak up the solution,
and must always be washed clean after use, if good prints are desired.
The light in the room may be bright enough to allow the operator to
work easily. Hang the paper up and let it dry, darkening the room
entirely if convenient.
When dry, spread the paper on the flannel, prepared side up. This


The Technic.
will usually require such a short time that the paper will not be injured
in a well lighted room. Lay the tracing on this, also right side up, clamp
or lay the glass on so as to press drawing and paper closely together, and
place in the sunlight. The ink lines on the tracing make corresponding
shadows on the paper, and here the mixture will not be decomposed, as
before stated, but will wash off in the bath. If the contact between
paper and tracing is not close the lines will be bluish rather than white,
owing to the light creeping under the lines. The time of exposure varies.
It may be only three minutes in bright sunlight or half a day on a cloudy
day. Allow a little of the paper to project beyond the edge of the trac-
ing, and when this is silver gray in color, seen through the glass, the
print may be taken off.
Spread the paper, prepared side down, in clean water, being sure that
there are no bubbles under the paper, as each one produces a dark spot
on the print. If the operator has plenty of time, he may wash the print
by laying it print side up in the bath and keeping the water moving over
it. The other way is better. The print should be in the water fifteen
minutes to produce sharp white lines. It is not necessary to wash it as
soon as it is taken out of the frame. It may be rolled up and put away
until a more convenient time; so, for example, if one is taking advan-
tage of a sunshiny afternoon to make a number of prints, faster than
they can be washed. When sufficiently washed, hang up by one edge to dry.
The lines of the drawing should be smooth and of about the same
degree of fineness to give a good tracing. Red or blue ink lines are very
good for supplementary constructions, or for dimension or center lines,
because they are easily seen on the print, yet are not strong enough to
confuse the drawing and make it hard to read.
The Gallate process, for producing black, or rather, dark brown lines,
on white ground, is in favor with some firms, but it has the disadvantages
of taking more time, as the print must be washed twice; once in dis-
solving mixture, then in water; and of not making so neat a print from
a worn tracing. Every spot on the tracing prints as plainly on the paper.
Pencil shading scarcely appears on a blue print, which, though a slight
disadvantage, is more than offset by saving of time and trouble.

PROFESSOR BYRON W. CHEEVER.
Died March 6, 1S88, in the forty-seventh
year of his age.
A work that is wrought out in the endeavors of science acquires a
certain momentum. When the worker is taken away from his place
among men the work does not pause, being carried on by the power of
previous personal impulse. In any realm of thought the force imparted
by an earnest man is often seen more plainly and estimated more fairly
after death has taken him away. So separate and secluded are the chan-
nels of men's labor, under the prevailing tendency to division of effort,
that people do not become aware of the toil of their contemporaries,
until some occasion calls for the writing of a record.
The death of Professor Cheever occurred just at the beginning of
his work for the second semester. He had closed his first semester's
work about a fortnight in advance to obtain time to make the trip to
Arizona. He had returned from the journey—one made rapidly for pro-
fessional purposes—and, suffering some indisposition, had appeared at
his post in the University, received a number of his students for the
arrangement of their work in the second semester, and had appointed
an hour for the organization of the class in metallurgy. Taken so
directly from the prosecution of his plans in applied science—from
arrangements to strengthen and extend the means of training under his
charge in the University, and from the settlement of grave technical
questions referred to him in the field, the suddenness of his death leaves
the more vivid evidence of the force and the system of his labors in
that special province whereto the work of his life was directed.
The pursuits of Professor Cheever's life, now that they are seen in
completion, appear to bear the advantage of a singleness of profes-
sional direction and a substantial unity of educational purpose. His
college course was taken in Arts, in 1859-63, when fully rounded profes-
sional courses were not readily accessible in the institutions of learning.
At that time not even at Ann Arbor was so much as the half a full
senior year open to the liberty of electives, but Mr. Cheever did not fail
to obtain a semester of analytical chemistry before taking the Bachelor's
degree, and shortly after his graduation he took several courses of chem-
ical laboratory work. Indeed these became his major studies, while it
seemed to fit his purpose, as the curriculum stood at that time, to adopt


The Technic.
the work of the department of medicine as collateral to his leading sub-
jects. At this time his brother, Henry S. Cheever, afterward professor of
physiology and materia medica in the University, was an assistant in
the chemical laboratory here, as was also the present writer. And it is
remembered that not infrequently the place of the assistant was supplied
with promptness and acceptance by his brother's service. Then a posi-
tion was obtained in the commercial laboratory of an analytical chem-
ist of experience with a large iron and steel practice in Philadelphia.
And after graduating in medicine, in 1867, Mr. Cheever engaged for sev-
eral years as chemist to a company shipping guano and producing fer-
tilizers. Again, he served as analytical chemist, and in iron and steel
work, in Philadelphia, and then he entered upon a long term of service
in the mining regions of the eastern slope of the Rocky mountains.
In Colorado and New Mexico Mr. Cheever became intimately
acquainted with the character and relations of metalliferous deposits,
and the conditions of their profitable working. Constantly in charge of
the assay of ores of the precious metals, he was frequently engaged in
prospecting in the field, and became familiar with the mineralogical
countenance of deposits, and the prevailing outlines of mining regions.
At the same time he had a wide observation of methods and conditions
of smelting operations for the concentration and refining of gold and
silver, and formed some acquaintance with works for copper, lead, and
zinc. He was a close and critical observer of industrial operations, and
he became a shrewd and accurate judge both of mining values and of
economic metallurgy. Had his health been sustained he would doubtless
have remained many years longer in the west, and have borne an import-
ant part in the development of its mineral resources.
Some distinct injury from the mercurial vapors of retorting works,
together with the exposure of an active frontier life, seriously impaired
Mr. Cheever's health. In college years he had possessed good physical
powers, and he maintained excellent health until after several years'
service in the mining regions. In 1873 he found a change of life becom-
ing necessary to his health and he returned to Ann Arbor, where his
parents and his brothers resided. Always disposed to give practical
attention to business affairs he now occupied himself by taking the law
course in the University. So far in life he had never turned toward col-
lege teaching as a pursuit for himself. With a hearty enjoyment of the
college work in the departments of the University from which he had
graduated with credit, and with a decided bent toward applied science
and metallurgical chemistry, he had sought to work out the problems


81
of technical skill in the world of industrial affairs, and among its com
petitions and rewards. He had not sought the task of training other
men, or the modes of research and of advancement which have their
services in the schools. Indeed with the practical intentness common
to men who are winning success among the shrewd and distrustful
traits of industrial enterprise he had come to hold technical schooling in
low esteem when he compared it with the gains of experience under the
hard demands of financial profit and loss. He preferred the trial of the
attempt to the teaching of the book. He counted little upon college
credits, much upon things that would work well.
Nevertheless the preference for his chosen technical subjects caused
Mr. Cheever in his leisure to turn toward the work of technical college
education, and, in 1878, he took a place in the teaching force of the chem-
ical laboratory of his own University, at first acceping a temporary
position in charge of quantitative analysis. His appointment to the
chair of metallurgy dates from 1881. To readers in the college commu-
nity, and among all the chemical alumni of the University, it is not
needful to enter into encomium upon Professor Cheever's ten years of
excellent college work. The work has been especially his own. In its
elaboration he was not disposed to utilize the labors of predecessors, and
even the appropriation of technical literature was to him a growth of
the teacher's college life rather than a resource to begin with. The
work in quantitative analysis, assaying, and metallurgy, since Professor
Cheever took charge of these subjects, has been in its direction emphati-
cally his own work, and to him and to his students the credit of this
work is due.
Upon the appointment in metallurgy in 1881 Professor Cheever gave
his efforts wholly to the advancement of his subjects as carried in col-
lege, and as represented in technology. And as soon thereafter as the or-
ganization of his college course was fairly well established he entered
upon experimental investigations to the extent of the time remaining at
his disposal. In these investigations he engaged his assistants and his
students, with him, and he did this with the distinct purpose of contribu-
ting to the advancement of metallurgical chemistry, and joining hands
with the world's workers in the literature of technology. He recognized
the duty, not without obligation upon experts in the field, but more
imperative upon experts in schools, to give their best results to record
for the benefit of their fellows, and pay back something for the help
which every worker owes to science. Professor Cheever's contributions
have in greater part been made primarily to the American Institute of


The Technic.
Mining Engineers, of which society he became a member at the Wash-
ington meeting, in February, 1882. The most of his contributions to the
Institute of Mining Engineers, published in its proceedings, have been
republished, with some condensation, in the journal of the Iron and Steel
Institute, of London. A few articles from Professor Cheever were given
primarily to other publications. An enumeration in a chronological
order stands as follows:

The alumni of the course of Mining Engineering and Metallurgy in
the University of Michigan lose, in Professor Cheever, a constant corres-
pondent, trustworthy adviser, and faithful friend. They will never for-
get his helpful attention to their favorable settlement in professional
positions. In the preparation of the " List of Practicing Chemists and
Teachers of Chemistry, Graduates of the University of Michigan, 1867-
1887," the directory for those of the graduates who are metallurgical
chemists was in good part compiled by Professor Cheever. And his con-
stant attention was given to the opportunities occurring in the east and
in the west, for advancement in metallurgical chemistry. There are no
offices more gratefully remembered than those whereby young profes-
sional persons find their first engagements for the actual work of life.
The organizations of which the deceased was a member, have, one
after the other made record, in love and in candor, of the esteem with
which he has been held. It has not been undertaken to add now to the
words of tribute that have been spoken. It was rather the desire to
place here, in fitting token of honor, some indices of labor that bear
the power of advancement in the progress of good learning.

EDITORIALS.
The Technic Board has endeavoured to select from the papers read
before the Society those most worthy of preservation, and can but regret
that it could not have trebled instead of doubling the former size of the
publication, for there were many other papers read before the Society
that were well worthy of publication. Besides these papers the Board
has attempted the innovation of a frontispiece, and take great pleasure
in presenting to its readers the portrait of a most conscientious and
thorough teacher, and thus offering a slight tribute of the good will that
our Society feels towards one of its best friends—Prof. Chas. E. Greene.
Besides the frontispiece we have the sad honor of presenting, as a Me-
morial from his classes, a phototype of the late Professor Byron W.
Cheever. The Technic has heretofore been published as a iSeries of
Selected Papers read before the Engineering Society of the University of
Michigan. This legend seemed too cumbersome; the previous Series have
placed our publication upon a plane where it needs no excuse for exis-
tence, and the Board deemed it well worthy of a name. Its papers are
certainly of a technic nature, and so we have christened it The Technic.
And now, hoping that our publication may receive a kindly greeting,
and may be looked upon as a credit to the University of Michigan and
our adopted profession, in behalf of the Engineering Society of the Uni-
versity of Michigan, we place before you '88's Technic.
The Technic takes the liberty of especially calling the attention of
its readers to its advertising pages, as we believe that the firms whose
names appear there, will be found to be thoroughly reliable, and many
of them already have earned an enviable national reputation. Those
who are accustomed to look over the annual reports of many of our
State Engineering Societies, are probably aware that such a statement as
the foregoing is quite common, while, we regret to say, there are firms
advertising in nearly all of the State Keports, whose work will not bear
careful scrutiny and examination. The Technic has spared no pains
to keep such parties from appearing on its lists, and it has even declined
some advertisements on this account. To our young engineering friends
we would add, that a knowledge of the standard firms of our coun-
try, whose business is connected with our profession, and where they


85
are to be found, is almost as valuable to an engineer as any information
he may possess outside of that connected with his purely technical
duties.
The Technic desires to express its thanks to those members of the
late Processor Cheever's classes, who have so generously aided it by the
presentation of the Memorial Portrait of their beloved instructor, and
is especially thankful for being permitted to aid in doing honor to one
so highly deserving.
The New Physical Laboratory.—By the liberality last of the
legislature the University has been able to erect a suitable building
for the department of Physics. It also furnishes accommodations for
the new department of Hygiene. The basement and first floor plans
indicate clearly the general arrangement of rooms devoted to Physics.
The greatest dimensions of the building are 72 by 115 feet. It is of
brick, with red sandstone trimmings. From the main entrance on the
north a descent of five steps leads to the basement, and a short flight of
stairs from the same main hall conducts to the corridor of the first floor.
The basement is eleven feet in the clear, and is finished with special ref-
erence to work in electricity. A Westinghouse 25 H. P. engine will be
placed here, together with dynamos, motors, a storage battery, and a


The Technic.
variety of instruments of the most approved patterns for measurement
of current, potential, and resistance. A number of substantial piers are
provided for this purpose, and the west end of the building has been
kept nearly free from iron, especially below.
The floors are of unusual stability, with floor joists 3 in. X 12 in. and


87
3 in. X 14 in., placed one foot on centers. On the first floor a large extent
of slate tables has been placed on stone corbels built into the walls. Two
brick piers and an independent wall furnish further secure support on
this floor.
The interior finish is in brick, with struck joints. The lecture-room
will seat comfortably one hundred and twenty-five, and will be arranged
for darkening by means of shutters moved by water pressure and con-
trolled by a lever at the lecture table.
The plans will show one large general laboratory for elementary
work and a number of smaller rooms for special work and for advanced
students.
With abundance of light, water under high pressure, steam both for
heating and for power from the new boiler house, gas, and electric light-
ing from a storage battery, it is thought that the department will be
able to shape instruction in accordance with modern requirements and
to carry on important investigations.
THE ENGINEERING LABORATORY.
We present herewith floor plans of the Engineering Laboratory
which will be of interest to our alumni and to engineering students in
general. The small brick and wood structure familiar to students in
1881 has been removed from the campus, and in its place a fine brick
building stands somewhat pretentious in its architectural and orna-
mental proportions. The liberality of our legislatures, upon which the
University depends largely for its support, has enabled the Engineering
Departments to offer to their students exceptional facilities for acquir-
ing a practical knowledge of the work of their professions.
The University of Michigan is a pioneer, and perhaps stands alone,
in offering to students of civil, mining and electrical engineering, as
well as mechanical engineering, these advantages. The various courses
are shaped with special reference to the needs of the different depart-
ments, and the work is changed frequently to add variety and to broaden
its scope. Originally this practical instruction was given by Professor
M. E. Cooley, and to a class of six students, the maximum capacity of
the shops. Now the work receives the personal attention of the Super-
intendent, Mr. C. G. Taylor, who, with the assistance of three skilled
mechanics, conducts all of the shop courses, giving instruction to from


The Technic.
seventy-five to eighty students. The Engineering Laboratory is under
the direction of Professor Cooley, and is divided as follows:
The Mechanical and Steam Engineering Laboratory, occupying the
basement of the main building; the Iron Room or Machine Shop, the
Wood Room or Carpenter and Pattern Shop, occupying the first and
second floors of the main building, respectively; the Forge Shop and
Foundry, occupying the wing; and the Offices, Engine Room and Wash
Room, occupying the first floor, and the Draughting Room, occupying
the second floor, of the central wing.
The Engineering Labohatoby.
The Mechanical and Steam Engineering Laboratory will eventually
contain the apparatus necessary for conducting experiments to deter-
mine the efficiency of machines, and to make tests of the materials used
in engineering construction. The tests in each case will be conducted
by the professor giving instruction on the work involving the tests. Up
to the present time only a portion of the apparatus needed for this ex-
perimental work has been secured, owing to a lack of funds, and the
practical work in steam engineering has been done at the mills and fac-
tories about the city. Perhaps no need is of greater importance than

that of testing machines for the strength of materials; and the atten-
tion of our alumni is directed to this need. From $2,000 to $8,000 would
fill the want for the present, and that amount it would seem should be
forthcoming from any one, or a number, of our successful engineer
alumni. Other engineering schools have been favored extensively in
this way, but ours thus far has been left to its own resources.
A favorite idea of Professor Cooley has been to make our Mechan-
ical Laboratory a place of original research, especially for students
returning for post-graduate work. There should be a fund to provide
the necessary expenses of such work, and to publish the results, which
there can be no doubt would add to our reputation, and call for renewed
and even more earnest work in the newer fields of engineering.
Let us hope that the good work planned for this department will
receive the hearty support of our alumni, and that the numerous body
of students seeking its advantages will find all that is needed to make
their efforts satisfying in their success.

italicized refer to machines not yet placed or in course of construction
by the students.

Any information in regard to The Technic, our Society, or the
Engineering Department of the University of Michigan can be obtained
by addressing Box 2786, Ann Arbor, Michigan.
The Technic Board heartily endorses these words taken from the
first publication of the society.
"To the alumni of the Engineering Department of the University of
Michigan:
"The objects of the Engineering Society of the University of Mich-
igan are manifold. Chief among these is the attainment of a more
practical knowledge of matters relating to our profession. Although
we have thorough courses in the various branches of engineering, we
are taught that completing a college curriculum is simply laying the
foundation on which to build in after years. On the completion of our
University work, we hope to approximate more nearly to our ideal
graduate by availing ourselves, while here, of the practical experience
each one of us may have had, and also by seeking a closer alliance with
our Alumni.
"The Technic is sent to every alumnus of the Engineering Depart-
ment, whose address is known to us. Nearly all of these gentle-
men are holding positions of trust throughout -the country, and can
readily perceive how valuable detailed descriptions of construction and
unusual methods of procedure are to the young engineer. We solicit
their cooperation, and will receive kindly any suggestions they may be
pleased to make.
"To those engineering brothers of other schools into whose hands
the pages may fall, we send cordial greeting. While you cannot become


The Technic.
members of our Society, you can become working and beneficial assist-
ants in our work. Not only should the graduates of one university
be bound together, but the whole engineering profession should be
united as one organization. Each and every member of this organiza-
tion should do all in his power to further the aims and purposes of his
fellows, and build up and ennoble his chosen profession.
"Therefore, engineering brothers, we extend to you that invitation
already given to our Alumni, that you will give us the benefit of some
of your studies and the solution of problems that otherwise must be
solved by us at the cost of valuable time, or perchance of still more val-
uable lives.
"We do not ask you for deep and intricate mathematical discussions,
nor for the finished drawings of your constructions, but for a plain,
simple statement of the nature of your problem, the difficulties to be
surmounted and the method employed by you in the solving of your
problem.
"Everything of interest to the engineering profession, is well worthy
our attention, and doubly so will be those methods of procedure that
have met and withstood the tests to which you have put them. Let
us hope that this is but the commencement of a long and profitable
acquaintance between you and The Engineering Society."

CONVERSE
PATENT
M JOINT i
PIPE.
During the past few years the National Tube Works Company have made wonderful
progress in the introduction of their t onverse Patent Lock Joint Water and Gas Works
System, having introduced it to hundreds of cities and town for complete systems and
extensions, and practically demonstrated the manifold advantages of wrought iron,
properly protected from the influences of corrosion, prominent among which are:
Strength of Material, Durability, Serviceability, Decreased Friction (Prof. Chas. H.
Haswell gives the opinion that Converse Joint Pipe has at omparative advantage of full
25 per cent, over Bpigoi and faucet jointed cast iron pipe in delivering capacity and this
has been greatly exceeded by practical tests) Economy in lead, freights, labor, etc., etc.
The mills of the Company at McKeesport cover fifty-two acres and they employ over
5,000 men, making their own special re worked iron for this class of pipe direct from the
ores, having their own foundries and in fact every department necessary for turning out
the finished product complete.
The Converse hub is cylindrical in shape, composed of the very best foundry
iron, and cast to perfectly uniform patterns, strictly in conformity with diameters of
the pipe." As wllln seen from the illustration, wedged shaped spaces are provided for
the reception of the lead, which is poured and finally calked, as hereinafter described,
into recesses which the lugs, or rivets, enter, and an annular ring against which the ends
of the pipes butt, forming a Hush and smooth interior of a continuous diameter with the
Inside of the pipe.
This special pipe is known by its exact outside diameters; Is made of a special
grade of superior fibrous iron, capable of withstanding excessively high pressures and
finished to such a nicety that it enters the Converse Joint and meets the inner ring of the
hub with accuracy. After being thoroughly tested by hydrostatic pressure, tapped with
a hammer while under pressure and proven perfect, the plain ends receive two strong
rivets each, which enter the recesses in the joint, straight, then being locked into posi-
tion, right or left, as the case may be. The joint is then ready to receive the lead calking.
The simplicity of the connection and the ease and rapidity with which it can be laid,
can be readily appreciated. The complete line of fittings,comprise connections of every
possible description and the specially designed tools and appurtenances embody light-
ness with great strength and simplicity: they consist of sevice clamps, combination
pouring and locking clamps, bending machines, drilling and tapping machines, calking
tools, etc., etc. Mostot the noted expert chemists and engineers have pronounced the
protections afforded the plain wrought iron against the attacks of all acids and alkalies
found in nature, perfection of completeness in the matter of durability. After the plain
pipe is thoroughly cleansed, it is treated with the Kalame in alloy (largely composed of

ADTOMATIC INJECTOR
SIMPLE, .
RELIABLE,
DURABLE.
There are many so-called Automatic Injectors, but when put to
actual test, they are only automatic under the most favorable cir-
cumstances. The Penberthy is the only Injector that is automatic
from 30 lbs. to the highest pressure at which it will work. It will
re-start, if curreat is broken from air getting into suction pipe,
sudden jarring, etc., without adjusting a valve—hence requiring
less attention than other machines. It lifts water and takes water
under pressure equally well, and is therefore a combined lifting
and non-lifting Injector. Send for descriptive circular.

THE LATEST. THE BEST.
"Notwithstanding that the Crosby
Indicator is the latest in the history
of indicators, it ranks as the best, not
only in the United States, but also in
Great Britain, France, Italy. Norway,
Sweden. Denmark, Germany and
Russia, and by the admiralties of
these several countries has been offi-
cially adopted. We may be pardoned
for adding, also, that the Crosby In-
dicator is the only indicator described,
illustrated and indorsed by the last
edition of the scholarly' Encyclopedia
Britannica.'"—1'ractical Electricity.
In a paper read before the "Insti-
tution of Civil Engineers" of London'
March,188S, on Non-Condensing Steam
Engine trials by Mr. P. F. Willans,
occurs the following reference to the
Crosby Steam Engine Indicator:
"The indicator diagrams were taken in all cases by the Crosby Indicator, and it
is not too much to say, that without that Indicator such trials would have been
impossible.
"It would be difficult to speak too highly of the working of these beautiful in-
struments, which produce perfectly clear and measurable diagrams at the speed
(400 revs, per min.) at which the majority of these tests have been made."
Charlottenburo. Germany. February 4.1887.
The Crosby Indicator works splendidly, and of the many different indicators of
other makers which 1 have used in my Laboratory, it is the best. I only regret of
not having known of the Crosby Indicator before.
(Signed) PROFESSOR SLABY,
Electro-Techn. Laboratory of the Techn. High School.
Galt, Out., April 8. 1889.
Gentlemen: The pair of Crosby Indicators purchased by Messrs. Goldie &amp; Mc-
culloch for me to use in their interest have given entire satisfaction. Although
I have used Indicators made by three other makers, I find the Crosby by far the
best. Yours truly,
W. T. BROWN, Mechanical Engineer.

PROFESSOR MORTIMER E. COOLEY.
Professor Mortimer Elwyn Cooley, the subject of this sketch, whose
portrait adorns the opposite page, was born March 28, 1855, in the town-
ship of Canandaigua, Ontario County, JSC Y.,on a farm about four miles
from the village of that name.
His early years were spent upon the farm, engaged in the usual avo-
cations of farmers' sons "doing the chores," and as his strength in-
creased performing more and more of the hard work of the farm. He
attended the district school regularly for a few years, and then only win-
ters as his help became more valuable during the active summer season.
The winter he was sixteen years old he attended the Canandaigua
Academy, hiring a room and boarding himself, and was expecting to do
so the following winter, but contrary to his desires, he was informed by
his father that he had engaged a school for him to teach, in the town-
ship of Hopenell, a not distant neighborhood.
"With reluctance he entered upon his duties, and perhaps with but
little interest in the profession that had been chosen for him. Interest,
however, was soon awakened, and the fact that the school was usually
considered a "hard one," and one in which more experienced teachers
had recently failed, acted as a stimulus. The row, not unusual under
such circumstances, culminated about the fourth week in active hostili-
ties, in which the youthful teacher was victorious.


The Technic.
The next Monday morning found his school doubled in size, and to
the end of the term an interested and successful one was maintained.
Commencing the next fall term at the Academy, boarding at home,
walking four miles to school in the morning and returning the same
distance on foot at night, that portion of the year he was enabled to
attend is now remembered by him as one of particularly good results.
The long walk was not lost time, for it was his custom to study his Geo-
metry lesson on the way, and the exercise was just sufficient to keep him
in fine physical condition. The year was not to be entirely devoted to
study, for during the winter term he was called upon to relieve the
necessities of the trustees in the district adjoining his old home, by com-
pleting the term in teaching their school, returning to the Academy
again at the close of those duties for the balance of the year. While
considering the prospects of a college education, which were not alto-
gether bright, an opening presented itself at the United States Naval'
Academy, and during the summer of 1874 he entered his name with the
Navy Department for an appointment as Cadet Engineer, and was duly
summoned to the Naval Academy at Annapolis for competitive examin-
ation in September, the savings from the winter earnings by his school
teaching sufficing to equip him for the trip and to pay its expenses. The
examination seemed very severe, and thinking he had not passed he
returned to Canandaigua, engaging to teach in the Academy while con-
tinuing his studies. He was hardly settled in this position, when to his
surprise he was summoned by telegraph to report at once for duty at the
Naval Academy, the records showing that "of seventy-seven (77) candi-
dates examined for appointment in September, 1874, and from whom
twenty-seven (27) were appointed Cadet Engineers in the Navy, Mr.
Cooley passed number seven (7) in order of general merit." The official
letter giving the information adds "and retained that number on the
day of his graduation, June 20,1878."
Having completed his course at the Naval Academy Sept. 11th, 1878,
he was ordered to the " Quinnebaug," and in November, 1879, was trans-
ferred to the " Alliance," both vessels then being on the European Sta-
tion. In the "tjuinnebaug" he made the usual European cruise, cover-
ing a part of 1878 and 1879, visiting Port Mahone, Malaga, Tangiers,
Algiers, Tunis, Alexandria, Joppa, Smyrna, Constantinople, Athens, Tri-
este, Venice, Naples, Nice and the Barbary coast. From Malaga he made
a week's excursion to Grenada and the Alhambra, and from Tunis he
visited the site of Ancient Carthage with his comrade engineer, VV. C.
Eaton, now Professor at Madison University, whose extensive classical


3
knowledge and entertaining companionship made the trip one of pecu-
liar interest and value. From Joppa, with a party of officers from his
vessel, he made an excursion to Jerusalem, and from Naples, visited
Pompeii and Herculaneum. Thus with many little excursions and inci-
dents of the voyage, the cruise passed most pleasantly, making for Pro-
fessor Cooley enthusiastic and enduring friends of his companions and
giving him a great wealth of pleasant memories. The "Alliance" on
her return to the United States was attached to the North Atlantic
Squadron and spent the summer of 1880 on the Newfoundland fishing
banks, later in the season being ordered to the West Indies.
December 3rd, 1880, he was detached from the "Alliance " and placed
on waiting orders. On March 29, 1881, he was ordered to duty in the
Bureau of Steam Engineering, Navy Department, and on the 2nd of
August, 1881, he was detached and ordered to special duty at Ann Arbor,
Michigan, under the law of 1879, by which certain officers of the Navy
are detailed to certain Educatioual Institutions as Instructors in Steam
Engineering and Ship Building. July 22nd, 1882, he was commissioned
as Assistant Engineer, to rank from June 22nd, 1880; in August 1885, his
resignation from the Navy was accepted, to date from January 1st, 1886.
While still a student at Canandaigua Academy, Professor Cooley
met Miss Carrie E. Moseley, of Fairport, N. Y., then a student at Elmira
College. The life of a Naval officer under strict orders from the depart-
'ment, and with long intervals of absence, is not always favorable to the
accomplishment of those dreams of companionship and home that
nature implants in mankind, but correspondence was possible and visits
were occasional. On December 25th, 1880, Miss Moseley became Mrs.
Cooley, and it is not too much to infer that the charm of home-life and
a most interesting family were not unheeded arguments in determining
his resiguation from the Navy.
The writer well remembers the advent of Professor Cooley at the
University, the interest among some, at least, of the officers of the Insti-
tution, which his enthusiasm and ability at once enkindled, the most
meagre outfit that the Regents were able to supply to the new depart-
ment, only a small temporary structure, 24x36 feet, to which afterwards
were added an unused carpenter shop and an old engine,— and perhaps
better than any one else, knew of, and sympathized with the dreams of
the young Professor — dreams that have already become realities!
While the "Quinnebaug" was lying at Alexandria the officers of
the city water works requested assistance from her commander in regu-
lating the pumping engines which had been placed in their new system of
i


The Technic.
water works. The task was delegated to Cadet Cooley, and after a few
days' study the work was satisfactorily accomplished, and a report made
covering the whole subject; this was received with great appreciation,
and the thanks of the company were extended to him.
The devotion of Professor Cooley to what he regards as his duty is
illustrated by the fact, long known to the writer, that early in his service
at the University he was approached to know if he could not be induced
to become interested in one of the largest manufacturing establishments
of the country in a position congenial to his taste and at more than
double the salary of a full professor of the University—he was then
receiving only the pay of an assistant engineer from the Government.
The overtures were declined, for he "could not consider such a thing in
the then crude condition of the department he had engaged to serve, and
his first duty was to establish the Department of Mechanical Engineer-
ing in the University of Michigan."
A shipmate relates: "I remember a long series of watches we were
obliged to stand in the engine room, three of us in three watches, four
hours on and eight off, night and day. This may not seem arduous
work to a landsman, but with the anxiety, trouble, and heat of the
'Quinnebaug's' engine room, it was enough to break a man down in a
very few weeks. One night, having come off watch at 4 p. m., I turned in
after supper to get what sleep I could before my watch at midnight,
and as I climbed into my bunk I exclaimed,' Oh! for a good sleep again,
I am getting worn out with these continued watches.' My first thought
when called for my watch was —' how refreshed I feel; never before did
six hours' sleep seem so long,' and on going to the engine room what
was my surprise to find Cooley there to be relieved, when I knew he had
come cff his tiresome watch the evening previous at 8 p. jr., or four
hours later than I had, and also to find the time to be 4 a. m., instead
of midnight. It was Cooley all over!" He adds: "This may seem a
little thing to you, but I tell you it is a sort of thing we rarely find in the
navy, or anywhere else, and it serves to illustrate Cooley's generous na-
ture and self-sacrifice for others. It was simply Cooley, and the Cooley
of that night was the Cooley of all his life while I knew him."
Circumstances have been most fortunate, hoped for, but unexpected
possibilities have become realities, encouragement has been cordial, able
assistance and counsel have been given by the other members of the
faculty, notably by President Angell, Dr. Frieze, and Professors Greene,
Davis and Dennison of the engineering department; but the greatest
element in the success of the department of Mechanical Engineering


5
has been the enthusiastic devotion of Professor Cooley to the cause and
his ability to induce a like interest in others. Indeed the most necessary
qualification for a teacher or professor, more important even than high
scholarship, is the ability to create and maintain an interest and enthu-
siasm in the student. This gift Professor Cooley possesses in an eminent
degree, coupled with thorough equipment, and his success is not sur-
prising.
Original researches with the class, the studying out of new problems
and the proving them by actual results, is the best of discipline for the
student, and this is one of the means by which he succeeds in main-
taining their interest. Perhaps, however, we should not give Professor
Cooley too much credit on this score, for the aptitude of mankind for
hand work may have much to do with the attractiveness which laboratory
and shop work seem to possess. Until very recently hand labor has not
been properly appreciated as a factor in education, and has even been
frowned upon as degrading in an educated man. In a recent work on
the Aryan race it is claimed that the people of that race are not as
faithful workmen as those of some other races, "his energy being rather
drafted off to the region of the brain," and that this is more distinctly
evinced, too, in the Anglo-Saxon than in any other of the divisions of this
great race. If this is so, it is also a fact that the Anglo-Saxon has great
adaptability to hand labor directed by the mind, and delights in those
studies where skillful handiwork is a necessary requisite to the suc-
cessful results sought by the brain. Hand labor, the manipulation of
tools, from a jack-knife to an improved shaper or lathe, the handling of
a pencil or graver, has natural attractions for our race, and there are few
who, at least as a pastime, have not handled "tools," or dreamed of time
and circumstances, such that they might do so. This may be one of the
reasons why laboratory work is so attractive, and why students of med-
icine look forward to the practical study of anatomy with keener relish
than to any other portion of their course, and why the tables of the
Chemical and Microscopical Laboratories and the chairs of the Dental
College are full and engaged before there is a vacancy, and why from its
inception, and with every increase of its facilities the Mechanical Labor-
atory has failed to accommodate more than a part of those desiring to
engage in manipulating its tools and machinery, and why in those
schools and institutions where drawing, designing, carving and model-
ling are taught, the estimates of facilities are always short of the
actual demand.
Professor Cooley is frequently called in consultation, and to make


The Technic.
tests and reports upon engineering projects. He was consulting engineer
in putting in the new steam heating arrangements of the University
and has given the subject of steam heating much attention. He is now
engaged in arranging the heating of the Ann Arbor High School and
the Students' Christian Association Building. Perhaps his principal
study is the steam engine, which, to his mind, is not likely to be displaced
at present by any probable discoveries in electricity or other motive
power, and he deems the fields for its use extending faster than science
and skill can adapt it to the new requirements, and that it has not yet
reached the stage of perfection claimed by many.
In his studies and researches he has accumulated much material of
an original nature which his constant employment has not permitted
him to digest into those papers which add so much to the rapid advance-
ment of science, and which give hints and ideas to their readers, leading
to still further studies and investigations in collateral directions.
Articles on "The Care and Management of Steam Boilers," "Heat-
ing and Ventilation," and on "The Dynamics of Keciprocating En-
gines," among some of his papers published, have been favorably
received by the engineering public.
Professor Cooley maintains a lively interest in the Navy and follows
with much detail the courses of the vessels, many of them officered by
his old classmates and comrades. He has great hopes and expectations
for the course in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering just estab-
lished at the University.
Professor Cooley is a member of "The United States Naval Insti-
tute," "Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science," member of the "American Society of Mechanical Engineers,"
charter member of the "Michigan Engineering Society," and a member
of its Board of Directors for five or six years, and is much interested in
its success; he is also a member of the "American Society of Naval En-
gineers," and an Honorary Member of the "Engineering Society of the
University of Michigan."
Most thankful are we that the Congress of the United States passed
that law of 1879 by which officers of the Navy may be detailed to insti-
tutions of learning to aid in instruction, and most fortunate was it that
Mortimer E. Cooley should have been detailed to the University of
Michigan, the right man in the right place at the right time.

SOME RECENT GERMAN ENDURANCE TESTS OF
METALS.
The experiments of Professor Bauschinger, of Munich, which form
the basis of this article, seem to the writer to be, so far as they go, the
most valuable endurance or fatigue tests which have yet appeared, and
deserving of far wider publicity than they have received, in this coun-
try at least.
They are published in "Mittheilungen aus clem Mechanisch-Tech-
nischen Laboratorium der K. Technischen Hochschule in Miinchen, Heft
XIII." The bare conclusions of Professor Bauschinger have been
translated and published, but their entire force and scope cannot well be
apprehended without some reference to the experimental results, and
these are too voluminous for entire reproduction in a technical journal.
The experiments point to more than they prove; the subject is young,
data are meagre and very costly to obtain, while the importance to the
engineering profession of the experiments which have already been
made cannot easily be overestimated; and in no other direction is fur-
ther work more desirable. We shall in giving the conclusions or
"Laws" announced by Professor Bauschinger, follow his language
closely, but the explanations and opinions advanced will be our own.
The experiments of WOhler and Spangenburg have been looked
upon as showing that it is very doubtful whether the elasticity, elonga-
tion, ultimate strength, and other qualities, as determined in ordinary
tensile tests of iron and steel, bear any proportion to the durability of
the metals. Those of Professor Bauschinger have been so made, and
furnished with collateral evidence, so to speak, as to exhibit with con-
siderable certainty, so far as they go, and with greater or less definite-
ness, the relations between the endurance limit of stress and the data of
tensile tests. The completeness and accuracy of the accompanying ten-
sile tests render the endurance tests very much more valuable.
The practical bearing of all such tests is two-fold, the answers be-
ing sought to two questions in chief. First, what working stresses may
be allowed upon a given material in order that rupture by the stresses
may be postponed indefinitely? Second, given certain working stresses,
how long may a piece of metal be expected to endure V
It is clear that, if from the data of a tensile test the answers to
these questions could be given for a particular material or piece, a very


The Technic.
great advance in our command of the subject of working stresses would
be attained. It is this most desirable end which apparently shaped the
experiments to be described and will also direct our brief presen-
tation of the subject. The earlier experiments seem to have been made
with a view to answering the practical questions above stated, in a much
more generai form (we think one entirely too general), for example,
what working stress may be allowed on wrought iron, on steel, etc.,
or, how long under certain stresses will a piece of iron endure, a piece of
steel, etc.? Wohler's laws can not be omitted from any discussion of
this subject. We quote:*
"Rupture of material may be caused by repeated vibrations, none of
which attain the absolute breaking limit."
"Differences of strains at the extremes of vibration are a sufficient
cause of rupture of continuity; and the absolute magnitude of extreme
strain is effective only in this respect, that, as the strain increases, the
differences which are sufficient to cause rupture, become less."
Quoting further, the experiments showed that vibrations may take
place between the following limits of tensile and compressive stress with
equal security against rupture:
Tensile stresses are to be reckoned -]- and compressive stresses —.

The limits of this article preclude our entering into the experiments
of Wohler and Spangenburg, even to the extent of giving any further
examples of answers to the first of our two practical questions. The
experiments are rendered unavailable for our present aims by insuffi-
ciency of data concerning the behavior of the materials used under ten-
sile stress. The wide variations in tenacity, ductility, and particularly
in elastic limit of different samples of iron and steel, would require
every lot of material to be subjected to endurance test before even
approximate answers to our two questions could be given, unless these
properties have no influence on the endurance, or unless we can derive
aid from the more simple and ready tensile test.
The endurance tests of Professor Bauschinger under consideration
were all made by repeatedly pulling a specimen of about one square cen-
timeter area and 15 cm. long, from zero load to a certain tensile load.
The final results upon all specimens with all the initial and final tensile
tests reported, are given in Table I. In addition to those tensile tests
many of the specimens were several times examined for elastic limit
during the progress of the endurance test.
Elastic limit was placed very strictly at the first indication of per-
manent set; a mirror apparatus being used capable of registering differ-
ences of length of .0002 mm. = irtW incn- The work done in this par-
ticular as well for accuracy as for thoroughness in general, strikes one
with admiration. Professor Bauschinger calls his so determined elastic
limit, "limit of proportionality." The point at which rapid stretch takes
place he calls "stretch limit" {Streckgrenze). It is the same which has
been called principal elastic limit, breaking-down point, etc.
[* Note.—Iu reducing centners per square inch German to English measures we fol-
low the figures of Prof. Bauschinger, p. 43, of the report cited, thus: "1 ctr. pro tq.
Zull — e.84 Kg. pro gem."— S1.X lbs. per sq. inch. The same results are reduced with
apparently incorrect conversion constants in Burr on electricity, etc., and Thurston on
Material of Engineering. Burr's figures are about 13 percent, higher and Thurston's,
about 7 per cent, higher than ours. Thurston also, on page 019, gives as loads which can
be borne indefinitely, the one-half of the loads afterward given on p. C24. Wohler pro-
posed a factor of safety of yt, so that the first set of figures are Wohler's proposed work-
ing stresses.]

We use the terms elastic limit and yield-point, the latter being so far
as we are aware, due to Un win. Yield point, be it understood, is the point
called elastic limit in ordinary testing done without very accurate means
for measuring small extensions. The original elastic limit is far below
yield point in many of the specimens, notably so in the iron plate where
the difference is 50 per cent, of yield point, and in the steel plate where the
difference is 20 per cent. We may explain that these large plates are
finish rolled at a low heat by which the yield point is elevated, at the
same time becoming indistinct, while the elastic limit is not raised in
proportion. In the other specimens the difference is not more than may
be quite generally expected. The yield points here given were not pub-
lished in the report, but have been kindly communicated to the writer
by Professor Bauschinger. We attach great importance to the yield
point as will be seen later. The fractures are very minutely described
in the report, and a photo-lithograph of them is given. We have con-
densed the descriptions sind will need to describe the "characteristic"
fracture so often alluded to as well as may be, but that, we fear, is not
at all well, for fractures must be seen to be appreciated. In specimens
broken by vibrating stresses it appears that the point of beginning of
rupture is generally darker than the remainder, and is usually at a
corner or on the exterior, and always at a flaw if any be found in the
fractured surface. Whether or not the dark spot in case of no visible
flaw indicates a hidden flaw, we are unable to say, but certainly in frac-
tures by gradually increasing stress it does not necessarily do so, but
often merely marks the weak or overstrained point at which the metal
first gave way. In the characteristic fracture, evidently radiating from
this dark spot, extends an area described as smooth, bright, fine, granu-
lar, and which is bounded generally by a curved line, so that the area
constitutes a sector of a circle or ellipse of which the point of beginning
of the fracture is the center. Outside of this the fracture will be often
granular, especially if the break is by bending stress, while, if by tension
it may either partake of the characteristic silkiness of mild material, or
be granular or crystalline if the material is hard enough ever to show
such appearance in the tensile test.
From the tests of Table I, as the highest stress to which each
material may be pulled indefinitely, beginning each pull at zero, Pro-
fessor Bauschinger derives the following, by the side of which we have
written the elastic limit and yield point for comparison:

These safe stresses (called by Weyranch "primitive safe strength")
looking upon them as answers to our first practical question, can only
be regarded as rough approximations, because the interval between the
successive loads tried, is quite large and some of the qualities are practi-
cally guessed at, but certain very valuable deductions are possible. It
is noticeable lirst and foremost that every determination of primitive
safe strength is below the yield point. Second, all except one are above
the elastic limit, that one being the Thomas soft steel boiler plate. Ex-
amining the test of this plate we find that every specimen broken by
the. endurance test had a flaw, notwithstanding which the four speci-
mens whose load was below the yield point and about equal to the elas-
tic limit withstood from 3 to 6 million applications. The fault in speci-
men No. 43 is so bad that we are justirleld in throwing it out so far as
general deductions are concerned. The other three, with less than a
million applications each, were loaded above the highest point given for
the yield point of the material. Two more with polished surface re-
mained unbroken under 6.5 and 4.8 million applications of loads about
equal to the elastic limit. A few observations on some of the other tests
may also be of interest. The iron plate shows up exceptionally well, the
safe strength being very close to yield point; in the one '• broken " speci-
men we observe no flaw, and it was loaded above the yield point. The
iron flats also give no certain signs of flaws and all stand well up to yield
point, and one specimen, No. 28, is alone among all the test in having
withstood over 9 million applications of a load exceeding yield point
without rupture, but upon being broken by steady load it gives quite
certain indication in the fracture of having been nearly ready to break
under the endurance test. The Bessemer soft steel plate has a compara-
tively high yield point, 67 per cent, of the tenacity. Breakages occur
7110 per sq. in. below the yield point, still in each such case a decided flaw

is to be observed, and one specimen similarly loaded, whose surface is
polished, had not broken with eleven million stresses. The interesting
and important question whether a high yield point obtained by finishing
at a low heat, as already spoken of, contributes to elevate the sate
strength, remains unsettled. The evidence in this case is rather that it
does so, and that the cause of our being obliged to put the yield point so
low is the flaws. Every specimen stressed above the yield point broke,
some having flaws and some not having flaws. The Thomas steel axle
withstood with safety a load of 4,000 lbs. per square inch below yield
point and 7,000 lbs. per square inch above elastic limit. The Thomas
steel rail seems to have been irregular, particularly in respect to yield
point— still it does not contradict any deduction that can be drawn
from the tests of the other materials.
The plain conclusion we draw from the tests is:
The limiting safe stress on sound bars of iron and steel for tensions
alternating from zero to that stress, is just a little less than the original
yield point of the metal.
This agrees with our preconceived ideas; ideas probably shared by
many, but probably with the notion "elastic limit" in place of "yield
point." It is time these ideas should be clearly distinguished by all.
The distinction is easy: Elastic limit is that load at which either perma-
nent set can first be detected, or, where increments of stress and strain
eease to be proportional to each other, the earliest certain and continued
indication either way being taken to mark that limit. Yield point is that
load at which rapid and considerable yield first takes place under a
steady load. Table I makes it clear that the primitive safe strength
depends less upon elastic limit, properly so called, than it does upon
yield point.
We will now recite, with some brief comments, those of Professor
Bauschinger's laws derived from experiments given in the report,which
bear more directly upon endurance.
(a) . By stretching a bar, that is by straining it beyond the yield point,
its elasticity rises not merely during the time the stress is applied, but
more especially during the longer following period of rest, and not only
up to but beyond that load with which the bar was stretched.
By elasticity is here meant the amount of elastic recovery. This
law is not new to the profession; its correctness can not be ques-
tioned. ,
(b) . The yield point is always immediately raised to that load with
which a bar has been stretched. During a following period of rest,
2


The Technic.
moreover, the yield point rises above the greatest load with which the
bar has been stretched, quite noticeably in one day, and continuing to
rise for weeks and months, perhaps years.
(c) . The elastic limit (limit of proportionality) is lowered by stretch-
ing beyond the yield point, often to zero, so that the specimen if it is
tested again immediately after stretching and removal of load, has in-
deed none or a remarkably low limit of proportionality. But in the
period which elapses after the application of stress which causes stretch-
ing, the limit of proportionality rises again, reaches after several days
the load with which the bar was stretched, and after sufficient time,,
certainly after some years, it is raised even above that load.
(b) and (c) are twin laws into which (a) in the form generally
accepted, has been resolved by the light of Bauschinger's experiments.
The distinction in behavior as between elastic limit and yield point, is
seen to be quite wide. We may remark, however, that the writer has
not found the elastic limit to be lowered by transgressing the yield
point, provided the highest load be allowed to act long enough to
produce its full extension.
(d) . By pulling a bar with loads above the elastic limit but below the
yield point, the elastic limit is raised, and continues to rise indeed after
the loadings have ceased, and so much the more, the higher the load.
The elastic limit reaches a maximum when it has been raised to near the
yield point, and by loading beyond the yield point it is thrown back
according to law (c) above.
Law (d) is further illustrated and proved by the examinations for
elastic limit already mentioned, which were made during the progress of
the endurance tests. The repetitions of load were millions, and it is
noticeable that the elastic limit is raised considerably beyond the strain-
ing load, particularly when that load is low, either with or without any
period of rest. The load imposed was generally greater than the elastic
limit and less than the yield point. Examples of elastic limits raised
above the original yield point as determined from a duplicate specimen,,
are not wanting, and it is the rule that the yield point is considerably
and unmistakably raised by the repeated stresses. We feel at liberty to
formulate this law not given by Bauschinger:
By oft repeated tensions of magnitude greater than the elastic
limit and less than the yield point, the original yield point may be
raised.
We do not consider this of any practical importance, except that the
fact being ascertained allays apprehension lest the opposite might be the-


19
rule, and that it helps to establish our primary conclusion from the test
as already stated on page 16.
(e) . By straining in tension beyond the elastic limit, that limit is
notably lowered for compression, and conversely, by straining in com-
pression the limit is lowered for tension, so much the more, the higher
the stresses. When an elastic limit so lowered, is raised again by stresses
in like direction and then overstepped, the limit of proportionality for
the opposite stress falls at once to zero or almost to zero. Time has little
or no influence on these processes, at least time amounting to three or
four days and even weeks, has but little, if any, influence. (Slightly
abridged).
This highly important fact is well sustained by the experiments.
This and the following two laws bear chiefly upon endurance of metal
strained alternately with opposite stresses. The writer has found, how-
ever, that a rest of 18 months completely restores the elastic limit in
compression where the bars had been stretched by a load equal to yield
point, even showing a higher elastic limit and yield point than could
have been found originally. The bars were small steel rounds and the
elastic limit and yield point were practically equal at about 41,000 lbs.
per square inch.
(f) . By gradually raised stresses, alternating between tension and
compression, the limits for proportionality for the opposite stress can
first be lowered ortly, when the stresses pass the original limit of pro-
portionality.
(g) . When an elastic limit for stress of one sign has been lowered by
a previous 6training in the opposite sign, it can be raised again bv grad-
ually increasing strains alternating between tension and compression,
but only to a limit which lies considerably below the original elastic
limit. The limit which it is possible thus to obtain, is afterwards given
in a law, which it is hoped future experiment will sustain as the limiting
magnitude of equal and opposite loads which may be borne with
safety.
As conclusions drawn directly from the endurance tests summa-
rized in our Table I, laws (h), (i), (k), (1) and (m) are given.
(h) . In case of repeated tensile stresses whose lower limit is zero
and whose upper limit lies in the neighborhood of the elastic limit,
rupture is not caused by from 5 to 16 millions of repetitions of such
stresses.
(i) . By oft repeated straining between zero and an upper stress which
lies near to or more or less above the original elastic limit, this limit is


The Technic.
raised, and indeed beyond, many times far beyond the upper limit of the
stresses, and so much the higher, the greater the number of strainings
without, however, the possibility of exceeding a certain height. Laws
(h) and (i) are clearly established as already pointed out.
(k). Eepeated straining between zero and an upper limit, such as
may raise the original elastic limit above the higher stress, do not pro-
duce rupture; if, however, the upper limit lies so high that the elastic
limit can not be raised beyond it, then rupture must follow after a lim-
ited number of such stresses.
Law (k) we have practically anticipated in our conclusion that the
limiting safe stress lies just below the yield point—for this reason—that,
although the yield point may rise during the endurance test, and even
the elastic limit may rise above the original yield point, yet if at the
beginning of a test we exceed the original yield point and continue
repeating the same load, rupture follows. It would appear from the
tests to be possible that, by beginning with a rightly chosen load, the
load might perhaps be gradually increased as the test proceeds without
producing rupture, so long as the load is all the time below the rising
yield point. This can be a matter of no consequence in the generality
of cases in practice but only an additional safety which, in practice, it
would not be wise to permit to influence the choice of a higher working
stress. Moreover, the yield point is easily determined for most speci-
mens of iron and steel, at least for structural steel, and the trial at rais-
ing the elastic limit is slow, difficult and expensive.
Law (k) is in a much more general form than the one we propose,
since many kinds of material have no definite yield point. Whether the
law be strictly correct in general or not, we offer ours for ready use with
iron and structural steel with considerable confidence, and are glad at
the same time to welcome Professor Bauschinger's as a rational theory
and perhaps a correct general law.
Law (k) as stated is, however, too favorable to the material in the
case of the iron plate. Thus, specimen No. 4 by repetitions of 35,550 lbs.
per square inch stress had its elastic limit raised to 35,550, yet broke
without sign of flaw after 2.3 million loadings, and the safe primitive
strength already cited is only 28,440, original yield point 29,720. Like-
wise with the steel plate, specimen 9 not long before rupture had elastic
limit 42,090 lbs. per square inch, yet safe strength can not be put higher
than 34,130. Likewise, with the 80x10 mm. flat iron, specimen 21 had
its elastic limit raised to 46,500, yet its safe strength can not be put much
above 31,280 lbs. per square inch. In the same way specimen No. 28 of


21
the 40x10 mm. flat iron had its elastic limit raised to 40,380 lbs. per square
inch, yet its safe strength can not be placed above 34,130.
(1). The tenacity is seen not to be lessened by millions of repetitions
of stress but rather raised when the test piece after such straining is
broken with a quiet load.
(m). Often, stresses repeated millions of times on iron and steel
cause no alteration of structure.
There is no evidence of any change of structure save at the surface
of rupture, on the contrary, to quote, "the alterations of structure which
appear upon examination of the final fractures, have been found only in
the fractured surface itself, and this has been indeed directly proven by
etching the fractured surfaces. At the minutest distances below the
surface of fracture the original structure is again evident." There is,
however, a peculiar marking which appears on the surface of a polished
specimen while being stretched beyond yield point, which is spoken of
and which in one instance, specimen No. 28, appeared long before rup-
ture. It amounted to a prophecy of final failure and makes clear to the
writer that the part of the specimen where it appeared, had passed yield
point.
This evidence of no alteration of structure is of much importance.
It relegates the idea of "fatigue of metals" to cases where metal has
become semi-plastic, or, speaking more accurately, to those cases in
which complete recovery from strain never takes place upon removal of
stress. In place of metal being "fatigued," or brought nearer to rup-
ture by working stresses well below the primitive safe strength, it is
really improved in tenacity and elasticity, while the ductility is not
notably decreased unless there be flaws.
Another idea long held by the writer is confirmed by the testimony
of these experiments, namely, fractures by repeated loadings below the
yield point of the metal are always "detail breaks." That is to say,
continuity is destroyed first at a flaw, or an overstrained spot, and from
that point the fracture spreads by ever so minute successive encroach-
ments until it has so weakened the cross section that heavy inequalities
of stress amounting to the same thing as crossbreaking strain, are pro-
duced in the yet sound portions, and the piece breaks with a fracture of
the remainder resembling that produced by nicking and crossbreaking.
A line of thought based upon the fairly well proved physical structure
of steel, aids considerably in making this clear, as follows:
There is no room to doubt that a piece of steel not hammered or
forged while cooling from a certain not very high heat, is crystalline in


The Technic.
structure. This is shown by fracture, by etchings, by the behavior un-
der heat treatment, and by the peculiar markings on the exterior of a
a piece which is being or has been stretched. Indeed this last proof is a
very strong one, for in cases where the crystalline structure is coarse, the
individual crystalline forms stand out from the surface somewhat
vaguely defined, yet sufficiently so to suggest strongly that the struc-
ture is made up of comparatively hard crystalline forms bedded in a
comparatively soft matrix. In the unforged steel the crystals may be as-
sumed to be cubical and to lie with their
homologous axes in every conceivable di-
^ s rection; an average of them, therefore,
4^ ^ assuming an axis in any one direction,
may we^ ^e rePresen*e(i by crystals,
^tyj^ ^^vj^ all presenting faces at 45° to the axis as
% Jr\ #%» in Figure 1, in which the white diamond
represents the rigid crystal form and the
&lt;^ 4^%b shac'ing the matrix, and the direction of
J"C *ne sna(*e lmes represents the direction of
ii^ %k 4^ the reactionary forces when the metal is
% &lt;S^v ^ree from inequalities of stress, or as
*" % sometimes rather misleadingly spoken of,
free from 'internal stresses. There seems
jf^'g Y W no more reason to speak of a crystal such
as that represented in the interior of a
solid body as free from stress, than in the case of a body resting upon
the surface of the earth, which is held motionless because gravity is
balanced by pressure between the earth and the body. Both are cases
of equilibrium under balanced forces.
Suppose the piece of steel of which Fig. 1 represents a portion to be
subjected to tension as represented by the arrows. The modulus of elas-
ticity being practically equal for the harder and softer portions (crystal
and matrix), the elongation and contraction which takes place will
only change the forms to parallel projections of those represented. We
need not draw them; the directions of the resultant forces acting
through the matrix will be altered, however, there being combined with
the original normal cohesive forces tangential shearing forces. When the
shearing forces equal the shearing resistance of the layer of soft mate-
rial, yield point is reached, the rigidity of the whole is gradually over-
come and alteration of form takes place, which may well be represented
by Figure 2, which represents the body under the stress. This figure


23
helps to account tor the peculiar fact that at yield point the stretch is
a definite, small amount and, for a succeeding small increment of stress,
increases hardly at all, when the load equal to yield point has been
allowed to act for a sufficient length of time.
We have drawn the direction of the forces in r
Figure 2 parallel to the tension. The resistance'
of the matrix metal to shear has been overcome, v
and it is to some extent plastic under any kind j. 1
of force but that shown in the figure. Now sup- $
pose that there had been initial inequalities of ,L s,
stress oetween certain pairs or crystals, as com- r 'iJjyjF % if ™
pared with the other pairs. The inequality I v
■could not be maintained without the existence fywjr \t f
■of shearing forces; wherever the shearing forces 1 t V
were, in the direction of the shears, induced by 4 \. ,J' \
stress between certain pairs of crystals, as com- V ''9

; V
•A
the tensions, one or more matrix faces would be J'?
sheared (not cut but rendered plastic) before the
same would have happened to the generality
of such matrix faces in a given cross-section. jFi'a.'S v
Now upon releasing the load, the recovery of
original length is no longer possible because the recovery effort at that
spot is lacking, at least in part. It is to be understood that shearing or
flaw may proceed only far enough to equalize the internal forces. In
case of yield point, as illustrated by Figure 2, it can not proceed further
than shown, until the harder crystals begin to give way under an appro-
priate higher load.
We present this conception of the structure of steel as a way of beg-
.ging the yet undetermined questions of molecular physics, as it were,
and still obtaining tolerably clear and practical ideas of what happens.
The applications are various and not difficult. For example, elastic
limit is that load, at which, either by reason of unequal internal stresses
or on account of flaws in the continuity, yield takes place at some min-
ute spot in the specimen. Yield point is already defined under this con-
ception. "Fatigue," being applicable only to those portions of metal
which are plastically deformed by the alterations of stress, begins at a
minute spot (the same or the worst of those spots whose yield caused
the elastic limit to be reached below yield point) and spreads by contact.
Analogous to this and, in the writer's mind, amounting to a demonstra-
tion, is the fact that the yielding of a bar at yield point is local and
•progressive. The plastic material fails to afford its wonted support to


The Technic.
the neighboring layer and that layer must yield and so on the next, while
a particle, whose neighbors have not yielded, is safe.
The smoothness of the early part of fractures caused by repeated
stresses, is accounted for by the flowing or shearing of the matrix, and
the crystal forms may be hammered by the recoil or reversal of stress
not to flatness but to irregular roundness. A sheared fracture of a
materia] which is at all ductile, always has a peculiar smoothness. The
detail part of the break, is, of course, supposed to continue through the
thin layers of matrix in a way which, we trust, anyone can readily
imagine with the foregoing theory of the structure before him. To
account for bright crystalline fracture,of the remainder we have but to
reflect that rupture is sudden and hence liable to take place through the
crystals rather than to follow the devious matrix, to do which, shear or
flow is pretty clearly requisite, and time is an element of flow.

AN ELECTRIC MINING HOIST.
The purpose of this paper is to narrate in general terms the circum-
stances connected with the erection of an electric plant for the trans-
mission of power in mining work, without attempting to go into details
of calculations or construction. It can not be claimed that the narration
possesses interest on account of the magnitude of the operations
described, but rather, if at all, from the fact that it relates the first
successful application to mining work of the electrical transmission of
power iu America, and the second instance of the kind in the world.
The first electric motor built and adapted especially for hoisting in
mining operations, constructed for actual use and not for experimental
purposes, and which proved, technically and economically considered, a
successful application of power, was put into operation in 1880 in the
Loire Valley in France by the Compagnie de la Ferroniere. A machine
of French construction, known as the Gramme machine, was employed
as a dynamo and another as a motor, the latter being connected with a
drum upon which was wound a cable sustaining the load. The work
done was comparatively very light and consisted in raising a load of
1,760 pounds up an incline 360 feet long, with a grade of four per
cent., in one and one-half minutes. The generator was situated some-
what less than 4,000 feet from the motor, the current being carried
over heavy copper wire; and the work, amounting to about two-thirds


25
of one horse power, is said to have gone on with little, if any, inter-
ruption.
Notwithstanding the successful operation of this small plant.which
apparently demonstrated important possibilities, no further adaptation
Cjf the principles involved was successfully applied to mining work until
the year 1888, when electric motors were placed in the mines of the
Aspen Mining and Smelting Company at Aspen, Colorado, which have
been, and are now, operating very successfully upon a scale of consider-
able magnitude as compared with the work done by the Gramme-
machines in the Loire Valley. In fact, it was only after long delays and
by constant importunity, attended by more than one failure, that the1
writer finally succeeded in securing the attention and aid of a manufac-
turer of electrical machinery, in his undertaking to provide the plant
required. The rapid strides made in electrical science within the decade
have opened to the comparatively few who have been engaged in that
branch of engineering, such a wide vista of- prodigious possibilities and
opportunities, that rational and persistent effort directed to the attain-
ment of given ends seems to have been confined to the operations of the
calmer minds, to whom is due all credit for practical results obtained by
steady application.
The conditions under which it was proposed to use power at the
mines of the Aspen Mining and Smelting Company were as follows:
The company's mines lie upon the western slope of a mountain, whose
ascent is at an angle of twenty-eight degrees from the horizon. The
ore, consisting of argentiferous galena and other silver bearing gangue
is found in the mountain, at or near the plane of contact of a superin-
cumbent mass of blue limestone with an underlying bed of dolomite,
and this contact plane dips in the direction north thirty degrees west at
an angle of sixty degrees with the horizon.
The ore body, so far as developed by underground workings, is more-
or less tabular in shape, conforming generally to the cod tact plane, with
great undetermined extent in the direction of the strike, and varying in
thickness from one to twenty-four feet. A tunnel one thousand feet
long, driven south into the mountain near its base penetrates this ore
mass at a depth vertically below the surface of nearly five hundred feet,
and is used as the avenue for bringing ore and waste material to the sur-
face. For drainage and tramming purposes, this tunnel is given a.
grade of three per cent, towards its mouth, while from its breast or inner
extremity, level branches or drifts were run both to the right and to the
left, following the strike of the ore-bearing plane and developing it in


The Technic.
its lateral extent. From these drifts, excavations penetrated the ore
mass to a considerable height above the tunnel level, all ore broken in
these regions being, of course, moved down to the surface through the
tunnel by its own weight in cars, no machinery or power other than
gravity being required. But in the development of the ore horizon
lying below the level of the tunnel and drifts, the question of power
became important. This development was begun by sinking two
inclines which were intended to follow the ore plane in its descent, and
which it was contemplated, might acquire very considerable depth. One
of the inclines began near the inner extremity of the tunnel, and the
other was situated three hundred feet distant in the left hand or north-
easterly drift. Both descended below the tunnel level at an angle of
Sixty degrees. Power applied to hoisting machinery of some kind was
necessary to bring up the ore and waste material from these inclines,
and a calculation of the requirements was made, based upon the usual
tonnage of the mine, with something added in case it might be deemed
essential at some future time to extend operations to a greater magnitude.
Allowing a large factor to cover the additional power which would be
needed as depth was gained, it was deemed best to employ one ten horse
power machine at the head of each incline to perform the present work of
raising two hundred and fifty tons a vertical height of two hundred and
fifty feet up a sixty degree slope every twenty-four hours at each incline;
estimating sixteen hours of actual working time, and including the extra
work necessary to overcome friction, the weight of ore, carriages, cable,


etc. The ore carriages were to run on four ten inch wheels bearing upon
T rails of thirty pounds to the yard, set at a gauge of thirty inches.
These carriages, known in miner's parlance as "skips," constructed of
boiler iron, and having a capacity of one ton, weigh about seven hun-
dred pounds each, making the total weight of skip and load 2,700 pounds.
The hoisting was to be accomplished by a cable winding upon a drum
set at the head of the incline. For the load designated, a Koebling Cru-
cible Steel wire cable 3-4 inch in diameter, laid with a hemp centre, sur-
rounded by six strands of nineteen wires each, was selected. The break-
ing strain of such a cable being set down at thirteen tons, three tons
would be considered a safe working load. The weight per foot being .88
pounds, two hundred and fifty feet would add two hundred and twenty
pounds to the load, giving a total of 2,920 pounds as the probable limit of
the weight to be raised at each individual effort under the conditions
suggested.
It will be borne in mind that the hoisting drums and propelling
machines used to accomplish this work would be located respectively
1,000 feet and 1,300 feet from the surface of the mountain, within the
confined limits of mine workings, so that economy of space became an
important question.
The first plan considered was the use of steam power. Owing to the
lack of draught for furnaces, together with the less important, but
serious question of the cost of excavating a chamber of sufficient size
underground, this plan would involve the erection of a boiler plant at
the mouth of the tunnel, 1,300 feet distant from the hoisting engine, in
one case, and 1,000 feet distant in the other. The steam would be con-
veyed these distances in pipes covered with asbestos packing to prevent,
as far as possible, loss of power by condensation. Nevertheless, the loss
would be serious and with the best arrangement possible, the writer con-
cluded would amount to over thirty per cent, by leakage and condensa-
tion. With coal at $7.50 per ton, or pine wood (two and a half cords
equal in steam making value to one ton of coal), at $3.00 per cord, the
waste of fuel presented an objectionable feature. While the exhaust
steam would be condensed at or near the engines, in casks of water,
"nevertheless, there would certainly be an escape within the mine work-
ings, which together with the over warm condition of the atmosphere
underground likely to arise from the presence of the heated steam pipes,
would constitute a serious objection involving the health of the miners,
whose work is performed ordinarily under conditions of imperfect ven-
tilation in an atmosphere rendered noxious by powder smoke and vitia-


The Technic.
ted by inhalation. The cost of the requisite boiler plant with steam con-
nections, under the circumstances, also would be unusual and dispro-
portionate to the results to be attained. While there were numerous
precedents involving all these adverse circumstances in the use of steam,
still, the opportunity for improvement was sufficiently apparent to urge
a strong effort to discover the means.
In casting about for a more economical plan and one involving
fewer objectionable features, the only remaining expedient seemed to be
the use of compressed air.
A very little investigation of this plan was sufficient to demonstrate
that in point of original cost and economy of operation, the use of steam
would be preferable, though many objectionable features in the latter
plan would be eliminated, the exhaust air in the mine adding a positive
advantage as a means of ventilation: but nevertheless, neither plan was
considered satisfactory.
While hesitating to adopt a plan which was manifestly not the desid-
eratum, it was a source of frequent reflection to the writer that far
more than the power required was daily going to waste through the
channels of mountain streams in the vicinity. One of these rapid water
courses, distant 0,000 feet from the tunnel mouth, possessed a mean dis-
charge of about one hundred and fifty cubic feet per second, under con-
ditions which would give by fluming for a moderate distance, a head of
sixty-five feet. Then occurred the idea of duplicating the operations of
the Compagnie-de la Ferroniire, but on a scale fitted to the greater
requirements. A flume was accordingly constructed with ample capac-
ity, and a Pelton Hurdy G-urdy water wheel was selected for the motor,
having a diameter of five feet. This wheel, represented in the cut, was


29
determined upon, owing to the advantages it possesses in efficiency, sim-
plicity of construction, wide adaptation to varying quantities of water
and power, and low cost, as compared with water motors of any oiher
kind. While in its general features and in the number and arrangement
•of its parts, it possesses the simplicity of the ordinary tangential wheel,
yet its high efficiency depends upon the nicety of the construction of its
buckets or cups, and the manner in which the water is delivered to
them. It will be seen that the stream is delivered through a diminish-
ing nozzle of small size, and that the impact of the water is received in
cups, in the centre of which stands a partition which divides the stream
in such a manner that its full energy is utilized; as in passing out it
sweeps against the curved sides of the cup and with an influence which
has the effect of a prolonged impact. Experiments made by Mr. Ross E.
Brown, at the University of California, in 1883, showed an efficiency
attained of 82.5 per cent., and this result has since been exceeded, the
manufacturers of the wheel guaranteeing 85 per cent, by reason of
recent improvements determined under varying heads of from 50 to
1,600 feet. In this instance a total head of sixty-eight feet was obtained,
and the water used was conveyed through a twenty-inch pipe to within
a short distance of the wheel, where it was contracted to eight inches,
and finally at the nozzle to four inches, so that the supply amounted to
about four and one-half cubic feet per second, the draught in the pipe
reducing the total head to about sixty-three feet effective head. The
theoretical power of that amount of water is thirty-two horse power,
while the wheel should return a useful effect of 85 per cent, of this
amount or twenty-seven horse power. By using two nozzles, in case of
need, twice this power could be obtained.
With regard to the transmission of this power to the point where
its application was to be made, it may not be out of place at the outset
to illustrate briefly and generally by describing a simple form of dynamo
and motor. Take an iron cylinder and wrap it lengthwise with a copper
wire, support it by its axis between the poles of an ordinary permanent
horseshoe magnet in a direction at right angles with the general length
of the magnet, and revolve it. As the wire cuts through the magnetic
influen«e of the poles an electrical current will be developed in the wire,
or armature. By substituting for the fixed magnet an electro-magnet
of sufficient size and by multiplying the coils of wire upon an armature
of proportionate magnitude, an electric current equivalent to many
horse power may be secured. An electric motor is precisely similar in
construction, but instead of being driven, it uses the electrical current


The Technic.
and drives, so that water power may be converted into electrical tension
by the dynamo, conveyed to a distance over a copper wire circuit to the
motor, and there reconverted to horse power. In order to secure this re-
sult a 500 volt, 80 ampere Edison dynamo was used, equivalent to the con-
version of 53 horse power. This was largely in excess of present demands,
but was purchased with a view of the possible addition of a second
wheel and the supply of additional power at some future time. It con-
sisted of an electro-magnet about four and a half feet long with arms
measuring twelve inches in diameter at the poles, including the wire-
coil, and other parts of proportionate size. The armature shaft carried
a pulley belted to the water wheel shaft and revolved at a rate
averaging 850 revolutions per minute. The electrical current thus
generated was conveyed over a circuit of No. 2 insulated copper wire on
pole supports, a distance of 6,000 feet to the tunnel mouth, and at this
point a specially made water-proof insulated cable, containing seven
small copper wires, was substituted. The insulating material of this
cable was a little over one-fourth of an inch in thickness outside of the
wires, and was composed in part of a bituminous substance called Bitite.
This substitute was made in view of the danger of grounding the
current in localities in the tunnel where a constant dripping of water
occurs, and to relieve the possibility of injury to passing miners. The
current thus carried a total distance of 7,000 feet to one motor and 7,300
feet to the other, was applied to the armature and there converted back,
with some loss, to horse power, by means of which drums were revolved


31
and cables carrying the load wound in and the work of hoisting per-
formed by a mountain stream, something less than one and a half miles
distant. As will be seen from the illustration, the hoisting drum is
mounted on a shaft, carrying a fiat-faced iron friction wheel, which bears
against a paper-faced pully hung on a parallel shaft, and this in turn,
connects by means of pinions with the shaft carrying the armature of
the motor. The speed is reduced by means of this intermediate gearing
between the armature shaft and the drum, from thirty-five to one. Two
electro-magnets are used in the motor, and these being series wound, the
speed of the armature can be varied, and the direction of rotation
reversed at will. The electrical current is controlled by the switch
operated by the crank shown in the right front of the eut, while the
lever seen, operates a wooden brake shoe bearing against the large
friction wheel hung on the drum shaft. The motor proper is swung
upon springs which take up all shocks arising from sudden changes in
the load. While it soon became apparent that several changes and
improvements would be required, the success of the undertaking was
demonstrated by the full operation of the whole plant at the first trial.
One of the main difficulties lay in governing the power at the water
wheel to meet the requirements of an instantaneous change from no
load, to a load of nearly one and one-half tons at the motor. This was
finally effected, with a reasonable degree of efficiency, by the use of a
water governor.which was so arranged as to deflect the nozzle supplying
water to the wheel, and thus increasing or reducing the power by direct-
ness or obliquity of impact, but without interfering with the volume of
the jet. A second problem which was solved with entire success, lay in
the difficulty of applying power gradually at the motors. Ordinarily in
turning on the current the whole effect of its power would be applied
instantly, with an abruptness dangerous to the strength of the materials
bearing the strain. This defect was overcome in part by a somewhat
complex switch,which throws the coils of a compound field into various
combinations, and partly by gearing set between the motor and the
winding drum, as explained above, so that the speed was reduced and
the power applied and controlled very perfectly.
Another unpleasant feature at first, was found in the escape of the
current from the armature to the iron shafts, gear wheels and lever
handles of the machine. Mechanics directing the hoisting sometimes
received paralyzing shocks through the lever handles, and the load thus
passing from their control became a source of danger, as, left to gravity,
the hoisting skip was likely to descend its inclined plane, to the great


The Technic.
risk of any person in its path. Gear wheels of compressed rawhide
were substituted for iron, and, while non-conductors of electricity, they
appear to wear quite as well as the metal, while rubber coverings to the
levers rendered them harmless. Calculating the power of the water
wheel at twenty-seven horse power, about sixty-eight per cent, of this
amount is delivered at the motors, or a little more than is required by
the combined work of both. The loss is made up about as follows:
Between the water wheel and the dynamo, consumed by friction, two
percent.; in conversion to electrical tension in the dynamo, ten per
cent.; in transmission from dynamo to motor, ten per cent.; and in re-
conversion to power in the motor, ten per cent. The excess of current is
used to light five incandescent lamps underground in the vicinity of the
machines. The electric hoist as it is now in use is illustrated by the cut.
It is compact, requiring but little space, cleanly, nearly noiseless, and
very economical; a comparison with steam showing a saving of thirty-
six per cent, in the cost of operating, the only material consumed being
a small quantity of lubricant, while the original cost of the whole
electric plant and water wheel is far below that of a steam or compressed
air plant. There seems to be no wear of any consequence in any of the
parts, and as a low tension current is used, no serious danger to the men
exists, and none of the connections have suffered from burning out.
By adding eighteen inches to the length of the armature shaft in
the moter placed at the head of the tunnel, and applying the proper
gearing, a second drum is operated which winds a cable running the
length of the tunnel. By this means trains of from four to ten ore
cars, of the capacity of one ton each, coupled together and attached
to one end of the cable, run out loaded, by their gravity over the three
per cent, grade of the tunnel on T rails weighing thirty pounds to the
yard; and are returned empty by winding in the cable over this second
drum. Formerly all tramming of this nature was performed by miners,
one man being required with each car to take it out loaded and return
it empty. In this way twenty minutes was consumed in the round trip
covering a total distance of 2,000 feet, and the work was hard. Now by
means of the second drum attached to the motor, the round trip is made
In four minutes as a matter of common practice, and a great saving
of labor and wages effected. Of course it is not practicable to operate
both drums at once, but no disadvantage arises from this, as the time
consumed in a single operation of either is ordinarily so short that the
work depending on the other can wait without harm. By means of
a pulley on the immediate shaft of the other motor, a band operates a


33
small fan blower used in the ventilation of the lower workings. Fresh
air is thrown into the face of the drift through a four inch tin pipe, the
amount of power thus consumed being too small to interfere in any
■degree with the regular hoisting work of the motor. The writer is now
engaged in the endeavor to secure a thoroughly effective and conven-
ient arrangement of a core drill to be operated by a portable electric
motor, especially adapted to that purpose and worked by the current
now in use. It is contemplated to use this machine both in regular
rock work and for prospecting purposes.
The plant has been in constant use since March 5th, 1888. Since
that date much larger machines upon the same general plan have been
put into successful operation, notably at Virginia City, Nevada, where
450 horse power is transmitted a distance of 2,800 feet in the Comstock
mine.
Similar construction is in contemplation for various other localities,
and there is a great likelihood that within the space of a few years, elec-
trical transmission will have taken the place of steam power for mining
and milling machinery used in hoisting, pumping, ore crushing, etc., in
localities where water power is available within reasonable distances of
mining operations.
The loss of power, in electrical transmission depending upon the
distance, should not prevent the construction of long lines, where fuel is
expensive and plenty of water power obtainable at no cost, because an
efficiency saved of even twenty per cent, in the latter case, would fre-
quently be better economy from the financial standpoint than the best
possible application of steam. Fred G. Bulkley, '75.

All the technical hrinche are under the direct care of those who
have had professional experience as well as a full scientific training; and
in all particulars the courses embody as close an imitation of the re-
quirements of active I:ii&gt; &gt;r as the instructors who have the severa'
branches in charge e.m devise.
The general scope of the courses of instruction may be seen by the
following descripti v outline:

instruction is given in t ic %■■ ealas veil as the mathematical analy-

the drawing board.


35
A parallel course in designing structures requires the student to ap-
ply the principles previously learned, and to prepare detailed working
drawings with bills of materials and estimates of cost of several types
of structures. They make the necessary calculations and proportion
the several parts for the needful strength and stiffness.
Hydraulics.—The laws of the flow of water through orifices and
pipes and over weirs, the gauging of streams, the designing of works for
water supply, drainage and sewerage, canals, and river and harbor im-
provements, are treated in this course.
Machinery, Prime Movers, and Millwork.—The instruction
covers the principles of mechanism and dynamics of machinery, with
especial reference to the design and efficiency of trains of gearing, screws,
cranks and levers. Special attention is devoted to water-wheels, wind-
mills and steam engines, and to the various problems in distribution of
power, and arrangement of shafting and machinery in manufacturing
establishments.
Machine Construction and Design.—Students are furnished
with the usual data for a design, and they are expected to make the
necessary calculations and drawings, paying particular attention to pro-

BENDING MOMENTS ON PINS,—BY GRAPHICS.
The pin which connects the several pieces assembled at anyone joint
«f a structure must be of sufficient section to resist the bending
moments to which the forces existing at any one time in the pieces sub-
ject it. These bending moments may be found by resolving the forces
acting upon the pin into two sets of components at right angles to one
another, drawing the equilibrium polygons or calculating the moments
for each set, and then finding the resultant moment at any section by
taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the component
moments.


37


The Technic.
The diagram accompanying this note illustrates a graphical method
for finding the desired resultant moments, and hence the maximum
moment; this method has been given in the course in Graphics at this
University for a few years, but has not been published before.
As the pieces acting on any well-designed joint are symmetrically
arranged, it is unnecessary to consider more than one-half of their num-
ber, and the sketch of the portion of a joint shown here will illustrate
the disposition of the pieces. The sketch, it is hoped, will also enable the
reader to readily catch the idea of the relative position of the two bending
moment diagrams. The pieces are parallel to the plane of the paper,
and the pin is perpendicular to the same, but drawn in perspective, as it
were, at an angle of 45° with the horizontal and vertical lines.
Then will AB represent the axis of the pin, and the arrows the direc-
tions of the forces in the bars and post, their points of application along
AB being laid off by scale at the centre lines of the respective pieces.
The bars are here assumed to be each one inch thick and the channel to
have one-half inch web. The oblique force is decomposed graphically
into two rectangular components.
In the stress diagram the horizontal forces are laid off in the order in
which they occur, and in their proper directions, viz., 1-2, 2-3, 3-4 and
4-1, closing on the point of beginning. Similarly the vertical forces are
laid off from 1 as a starting point, at 1-5, 5-6, and 6-1. The line 1-0 is
then drawn at 45°, representing a perpendicular to 2-3 and 1-5, and
made of a convenient length, here 20,000 lbs.
From the stress diagram 023, the equilibrium polygon CDF for hor-
izontal forces is drawn, starting at the first horizontal force C with aline
parallel to 0-2, and ending with one parallel to 0-1, and hence parallel to
AB. From the stress diagram 015 is obtained the equilibrium polygon
for vertical forces, beginning at the first vertical force with a line paral-
lel to 0-5 and ending with one parallel to 0-1. If one remembers
that any side of an equilibrium polygon is parallel to the line in the
stress diagram which runs to that point of division on the load line com-
mon to the two forces at the extremities of the side of the polygon, no
difficulty need be experienced in the construction.
At any point of the pin the vertical and the horizontal ordinate will
have for their resultant a value equal to the hypothenuse of the right-
angled triangle of which they are the legs. Hence it is easy to see, or to
ascertain by scale, that GF will be the longest hypothenuse which can
be drawn; and this hypothenuse multiplied by 0-1, or 20,000 lbs., gives,
in this case, 60,050 inch R&gt;3. as the maximum bending moment on the pin.


39
If one desires to try the effect of changing the order of the bars on
the pin, it can readily be done. Suppose the diagonal tie to change
places with the next chord bar. The horizontal stress diagram then
becomes 1-2, 2-3, 3-4' and 4/-1. The equilibrium polygons will now be
CDEL and NIK; and the maximum hypothenuse is KL, giving a
moment of 80,000 inch lbs., showing that the change is for the worse,
although the horizontal moment is diminished.
This method is useful also in cases where the pin should be treated
as having three points of support, and in other problems of forces not
parallel.

A FIRST-CLASS PASSENGER COACH.
The object of this paper is, not to trace the development of the
passenger car from its former rude condition, when it was nothing but a
stage coach body set up on car-wheels, to its present almost perfect state,
not to enter into any discussion of its mechanical details, but simply to
give, if possible, a general idea of the cost and construction of a "first-
class" passenger car, as built by a prominent road in this section of the
country.
We shall describe the trucks first and afterwards the car-body.
The trucks of all cars in the passenger line, except perhaps some
"baggage" or "second-class" cars, are now furnished with steel-tired
paper wheels, either 30 or 42 inches in diameter, usually the latter. A 42-
inch wheel, such as shown at A, costs about $75.00, and as
there are eight under each car, the total cost of wheels alone
is $600.00. After running about a year, the tire of the wheel,
with ordinary usage, becomes hollowed out and irregular in
form and has to be turned down in a lathe to the standard
shape. After two or three such "turnings" the wheel has
to be re-tired, an operation that costs something over S50.00_
The wheel is guaranteed by the company manufacturing it,
to run 260,000 miles, about four years of ordinary traffic, be-
fore requiring replacement. The hub, II, is bored out to four
and seven-eighths inches and a wheel seat is turned on the"
axle to a size, fitting i.ito the wheel so tightly as to require a pressure of
from 40,000 to 00,000 pounds to force it to its proper place, i. e., until the
wheels are at the proper gauge.


The Technic.
L\] lb
At the end of the axle are the bearings,
three and three-fourths by seven inches,
on which the whole weight of the car
rests. The "brass," or journal bearing,B,
is held by a wedge, \V, to its proper posi-
tion above the axle inside of the "journal
box," a section of which is shown at J.'
n A brass can be removed at any time and
replaced by another, by simply placing a
jack under the box and raising it until the
wedge falls below the projection in front
v—sir
of it. The opening, D, in the back of the boxes being necessarily of
larger diameter than the axles,
would allow the oil, which fills
the bottom of the "box," to es-
cape and the dust to get in; this
is prevented, in a measure, by a
"dust guard" "g," made of wood
or leather and cut to lit closely
around the axle. The opening in
the front of the box is covered
by a lid marked L in Plate II.

bolted on b &gt;th side3. N"ear the middle of the frame, and extending
across it, are two pieces of oak, D, four by nine inches, and, extending
both ways from these toward the ends of the frame, are four other
■pieces, E, th;it are intended to prevent the frame from falling to the
tracks in case the axle should break off at the journal bearing; it will
be seen in Section at AA, that the above mentioned pieces will come to a
bearing on the axle after dropping about three inches.
Referring now to the Half-Section I3B, running along the piece. I),
which is the one marked by the same letter in the plan, and which is
secured at the top by two large nuts; here will be seen a U shaped
"hanger," II, that carries a piece, I, in about the same way that one link
of a chain carries another. Two "hanger bars," extending through the
pieces marked I, carry the "sand plank," K. Resting in Hat castings on
the "sand plank" directly over the "hanger bar" will be noticed the
quadruple-elliptic springs, ES, which support the "bolster," seen at M;
Section A A. The bolster carries one-half the entire weight of the car,
and pieces of sheet-iron, three-eighths by six inches, have to be bolted
between two of the four pieces of oak of which it is made, to give it the
necessary strength. The center casting, O, fits into a corresponding one
on the bottom of the car body, and, with the one and seven-eighths inch
wrought iron pin which goes through them, forms the only connection
between the car and the truck. In this way the necessary motion for
going around curves, is provided for.
The pedestals, P, hold the journal boxes in their places in a vertical
position and allow an up and down motion between the points X and Y.
The "brake beams," U, are hung from the frame and kept the
proper distance from the tire of the wheel by the springs, Y. When the
"brake shoe," W, wears out, it can be separated from the "head," Z, by
pulling out the key, K, and can then bs replaced by another.
If the tire of one of the wheels strikes an obstruction, it rises, the
journal box is raised nearer to the top of the pedestal, carrying the end
of the equalizing bar with it. The upward motion of the latter com-
presses the coil springs and forces the frame up; the frame, in turn,
lifts the hangers which carry the sand-plank, and compresses the elliptic
springs; the springs lift the bolster and finally the car-body. Thus we
see that every disturbance passes through two sets of springs before
reaching the body of the car, making the effect of a jar very slight.
The truck, as now built, is not the result of the eiforts of any one
man, but it is the outcome of years of experience and of the efforts of
many skilled men.


The Technic.
The total cost of a pair of such trucks is about $1,100.
The inside finish of a car, the trimmings, seats, lamps, hat racks'
heaters, bell-cords, etc., are familiar to all. The outside appearance is
equally familiar. We shall speak, therefore, only of the part that is not
usually seen, namely the frame.
Plate III.
Six Norway pine, longitudinal sills, about 52 feet long, mortised into
the end sills, with pieces of the same material, two inches wide by six
and one-half inches deep, mortised into them at nearly equal intervals of
two feet, make up the bottom of the frame. The four intermediate sills.
are rectangular in section, four and one-half inches wide by six and one-
half inches deep; the two outer sills are four and one-half inches by
eight and one-fourth inches, with a rabbet, three-fourths of an inch wide


45
by one and three-fourths inches deep, on the inside top corner, to receive
the flooring. See Plate III, K.
The end sills, 8, are strengthened by bolting an iron plate, P, three-
eights by six and a half inches, between them and a piece of oak two
and one-half inches by six and one-half inches, which has to be added to
receive the tenons of the longitudinal sills. All joints are secured by
"joint bolts." And five-eighth inch rods, extending across the bottom
frame through the sills at intervals of about two feet, tie the frame
together. The transoms, T, (see end elevation), that support the car on
the trucks, and the necessary cross pieces, A, are bolted in place, and the
truss rods are tightened up by means of the turn-buckle at the middle.
An under flooring of matched pine is then put in between the sills, and
the space between it and the top of the sills is filled with "mineral
wool" to deaden the noise when the car is in motion. The "wool" is a
rather light, woolly, non-combustible substance made from the iron slag
obtained in the reduction of iron ore. The floor proper is of two thick-
nesses; the first one is made of pine laid diagonally, the second, of maple
laid lengthwise of the car. A layer or two of heavy paper is usually put
between the two.
We will now look at the side elevation of the frame. After the bot-
tom has been finished the pine pillars, B, one and one-fourth by four and
three-eighths inches in section, are laid across it with their lower ends
opposite the proper mortises in the top of the side sill, S, and the tenons
on their upper ends are driven into mortises in the plate, C. The whole
side is then raised to a vertical position and held by temporary braces.
The same is done with the other side. The girts, D, and the "belts," E,
run the entire length of the car, no provision being made as yet for the
bracing, F. The upper deck, G-G, having previously been put together,
is raised to its proper height and secured by a temporary support. When
the lower car-lines, H, and the upper ones, I, have been put in place, the
supports are removed. Looking at the inside of a finished car there is
apparently nothing to keep the top from settling down and forcing out
the sides; but this is prevented by eight "continuous iron car-lines," L,
seen in the side elevation of the frame. These car-lines are bolted to the
plates and arch over from one side to the other, following the outlines
of the roof.
After the entire frame has been put together, jacks are placed under
the center and it is given a camber of five-eighths of an inch between
the points M, where it is to rest on the trucks; from the points M, to
the ends of the car, the frame is horizontal, if properly built.


The Technic.
With the frame in this
position, pieces of oak one
and one-half by six inches
in section, are clamped
against the sides in the
proper position to form the
bracing, F. The intersec-
tion of these pieces with
the girt pillars, etc., are
then carefully marked and the latter are cut
away sufficiently to allow the braces to be set in
"flush" with the side of the car. If properly
made and carefully fitted these braces, together
with the truss rods which are drawn up very
tightly by using a crowbar in the turn-buckle,
are sufficient to keep the car from sagging. A
plank, S, called the "seat rest," about three
inches thick by twelve wide, extending the en-
tire length of the car and checking into each
pillar, also contributes to this end. The ends of
the car which project about eight feet (including
the platform) beyond the point of support, are
prevented from bending down or breaking off
by an iron strap, three-eighths by two inches in
cross-section, with an inch round iron welded
on the ends, extending the entire length of the
car, over castings at O, and through the sills
near their ends at P. The pieces marked K, are
added to stiffen the pillars and to receive the
nails that hold the outside sheathing. Half-
inch rods extending down the sides of the pillars
and through the plates and sills, hold the sides
together. The spaces between the windows and
below them are covered with "matched white
wood" sheathing three quarters by two inches.
The decks and roof are covered with pine sheath-
ing and then with tin, except at the ends, where
the roof turns down; here copper is used, as the
cinders from the locomotive striking against it


4Ti
would soon cut through tin. After the sheathing is all on, small
triangular pieces of wood, about one inch on the face and two inches
long, are dipped into glue and stuck into all corners where the inside
surface of the sheathing meets another surface at right angles, as at
t, Plate III.
Before leaving the shops, the outside of the car receives in all, five
coats of paint and three of varnish; the inside receives one coat of filling,
one of shellac and two of varnish, after which it is rubbed with pumice
stone and a coat of rare linseed oil is added.

NATURAL GAS.
That the earth contains inflammable gas, has been known from time
immemorial. In portions of China, on the eastern borders of the Cas-
pian Ssa, and in many vole mic regions, it has l)3en issuing from crevices
and springs for an absolutely unknown period. Its practical utilization,
however, as a fuel of the highest efficiency is a matter of the last ten
years. The first record we have of natural gas being employed lor any
purpose whatever is the lighting of Fredonia, N.Y., in 1821. The gas in
this case was taken from a shallow well, some 27 feet in depth, and was
sufficient to supply only some 30 burners. Its existence in this country
was known considerably earlier than this, however. In 1775 a burning
spring was reported in the Kenawha Valley, West Va., by explorers, and
twenty-five years later, when boring for salt water was commenced in
this valley, it was found in many places and in abundance. The gas was
found at quite inconsiderable depths; in many cases only 18 or 20 'feet
The first use of natural ga-i for manufactures was in this valley, in its
utilization for boiling brine, in 1811.
At and near Findlay, Ohio, gas has been known to occur since 183(&gt;,
when a flow was struck in digging a well. Since then it lias been struck
in that vicinity on digging wells, cellars and s nvers. From the begin-
ning of the drilling for oil in Pennsylvania in 1859, gas has been found
in greater or less quantities, either alone or accompanying the oil. Its
value was far from being appreciated, as it was for many years regarded
as a dangerous nuisance.
Seemingly it occurred to no one to use it as a motive power in bor
ing, and coal was hauled with the greatest expense and labor up steep


The Technic.
mountains, when there was a superabundance of good fuel for drilling
constantly going to waste. It was used in iron manufacture at Leech-
burg, Pa., as early as 1873, when the gas from a neighboring well was
piped to a mill in that place.
In 1875 the gas from a powerful well in Butler Co., Pa., was piped
seventeen miles through a six-inch pipe of J£ inch iron, to the rolling mill
of Spang, Chalfant &amp; Co., of Etna—just outside of Pittsburg. This
firm may be regarded as a pioneer in the employment of natural gas in
iron and steel work.
The progress of discovery and development of the gas industry now
followed a somewhat circular course, with Pittsburg as the centre. In
1876 and '77 the Kittanning field was rapidly developed and the gas piped
to the rolling mills of the Kittanning Iron Co.
In 1878 an enormous flow of gas was struck at Murrysville, West-
moreland Co. This field developed rapidly, and in 1882 and '83 two
more productive areas were struck, one at Tarentum, on the Allegheny,
about 25 miles above Pittsburg, and the other in the city itself. In 1883
gas was piped to Pittsburg from Murrysville while an 8-inch main 8
miles in length, was laid to Braddock. This supplied both the Edgar
Thompson and Hometead Steel Works, and displaced over 700 tons of
coal per day, in these two works alone.
A perfect furor for boring was now started. The use of gas in
the steel and iron works in and around Pittsburg, which up to this
time had been regarded as a somewhat doubtful experiment, at once
became universal. In the mean while Ohio was coming to the
front as a gas producer. In 1884 a company was formed to drill at
Findlay. They were eminently successful, and within three years
the Findlay field has become one of the three great gas centres of
the country.
As a matter of interest rather than for any special scientific value, we
give the figures for the consumption of gas in the United States, with per
cent, of increase per year, and the per cent, furnished by the Pittsburg
field alone. The figures enable one to realize somewhat more adequately
the tremendous development of the gas industry in the past few years,
but being rough estimates, and based on the amount of coal displaced,
they should be regarded as in no sense accurate. The last column
represents what per cent, of the whole was furnished by the Pittsburg
■district.

It requires but little consideration to see that the value of natural
gas as a fuel depends not only on a proper chemical composition, but
even more largely on its distribution with the involved geological ques-
tions. The gas has been piped to distances of 100 miles and over, but
such distances are excessive and require phenomenal pressure in the
wells to overcome the resistance and friction. It is evident, then, that
the value of natural gas must be very largely dependent on the possi-
bility of its being used where found or near by.
Only the merest summary of its distribution and geology can be
given here.
Two general statements of great importance scientifically and com-
mercially as well, may be readily deduced from the knowledge already
gained by boring.
1st. Along the Atlantic coast east of the Appalachians (including
in this term the Green Mountains) gas is not found, except in such small
quantities, and in such recent formations, as to hold out no promise
whatever of any considerable or permanent supply.
2nd. The chief sources are in the Mississippi Valley, and up to the
present, are included in that portion east of the river itself.
From the most probable theories concerning the formation of gas
(which will be touched upon, further on), we must assume that it is
produced over areas vastly greater than are those in which it is found
accumulated in commercial quantities. For any given district to pos-
sess valuable supplies of gas the following conditions are evidently
necessary:
There must be, 1st, a porous rock reservoir; 2d, an impervious cover
4


The Technic.
—as shale, clay or slate; and 3d, the necessary relief to the strata, to effect
the accumulation of the gas in sufficient quantities and under sufficient
pressure. Any extended consideration of the geology of the various gas
districts of the country, is impossible here, and the most meagre state-
ments must suffice.
In Pennsylvania, easily first in production, up to date, the gas is
found stored in a vertical range of upper Devonian and lower Carbonif-
erous strata—3,000 feet in thickness. The gas bearing strata are sand-
stones, and the occurrence of gas at any particular place depends largely
on the porosity and homogeneity of the sandstone reservoir; the extent
to which the strata above the sands are cracked; and the general relief
of the sandstone strata.
In Ohio, the following strata are gas bearing: Berea Grit, Ohio
Shales, Clinton Limestone, Utica Shale, and the Trenton Limestone.
The last formation is, however, the important gas producer of both Ohio
and Indiana. In comparison with it the other formations named sink
into insignificance. It is now furnishing in these two states the largest
continuous gas feeders in the country, the productive areas spreading
out like coal fields. The Findlay field, where gas was first found in Ohio,
still leads in production.
A discovery of greatest scientific interest,and of no small commercial
importance, has been made in connection with the Ohio and Indiana gas
fields. The discovery concerns the Trenton Limestone as a gas producer,
and is this: the rock is largely productive only where its upper portions
have been replaced by Dolomite or Magnesian-Limestone. This change
has taken place in a marked degree in the Ohio and Indiana gas-regions
but in Southern Ohio, and in general, outside of the gas district, there is
no trace of this replacement. The difference in composition is shown by
these analyses: the gas rock of Ohio approximates CaCo, (Limestone,
pure) 51-55%; MgCo3 (Magnesian-Limestone or Dolomite) 36-44%;
Silicious matter, low, 1-2%. In the lower divisions of the Trenton, in
the gas-region, and in the entire Trenton outside the gas-region, this
striking change takes place: CaCo3, rising to 80-88%; MgCo3, falling to
2-6%; Silicious matter largely increased, 12-17%. The Trenton has been
drilled for gas, from Quebec to the Rocky Mountains, and the fact that
it is barren where of normal composition, may be considered well
established.
While the gas-fields of Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana, comprise
the really valuable accumulations, so far as the present development
goes, more or less limited supplies have been struck in New York, West


51
Virginia, Kentucky, Illinois, Kansas, Arkansas, Colorado, California,
Missouri, Michigan, Louisiana, Iowa, Wisconsin, Dakota, Utah, and
Wyoming. Natural gas is thus seen to be of wide distribution, geograph-
ically, and to occur in widely separated horizons, geologically. The
three fields mentioned above, however, are the only ones that have, as
yet, combined the requirements of permanency, quantity, and a popula-
tion dense enough to utilize the gas to advantage.
The tremendous pressures so commonly attained by gas wells, while
they have often rendered the gas difficult to control, have nevertheless
greatly increased the ease of transportation and the area of territory
supplied. Many explanations have been advanced to account for such
high rock pressures, often exceeding 750 pounds per square inch. The
explanation which most naturally suggests itself is simply hydrostatic
pressure. It is easy to see how this would be brought into play on
account of the necessary relief of the impermeable cover, and the con-
finement under it of gas, oil, and water. Where the relief was suitable
the head of water might easily be sufficient to account for the highest
known pressures.
This explanation, it may be added, accords entirely with every-day
experience in gas and oil fields.
The theories that have been advanced to account for the origin of nat-
ural gas are very numerous, but may be all referred to these two general
groups:
1st. Origin of gas referred to inorganic sources; i. e., the result of
chemical reactions between purely mineral matters.
2nd. Origin of gas (and oil) referred to decomposition or destructive
distillation of animal and vegetable substances stored up in the strata.
Of the first class of theories it may be said that, while perhaps
representing chemical reactions, in themselves possible, they all ignore
to a greater or less extent the geological facts involved. They also
involve the assumption of operations in their nature incapable of verifi-
cation, and would seem to require much greater evidence in their favor
than has yet been produced, before any weight can be given them.
That oil and gas are derived from the decomposition of organic
matter is now pretty generally accepted, although authorities still differ
rather widely as to the exact manner in which the process has been car-
ried on. The briefest kind of a summary of the views best supported
would be: 1st, gas and oil are derived from organic matter, mostly veg-
etable; 2nd, they are derived from both shales and limestones; 3rd, the
stock is practically complete.


The Technic.
In composition, natural gas consists essentially of mixtures, in
somewhat variable proportion, of marsh gas and the two following mem-
bers of the marsh gas series, (Ethane and Propane), Ethylene or Olifiant
gas, and small quantities of carbonic oxide, carbonic acid and free oxy-
gen, nitrogen and hydrogen. The main constituent in all cases, however,
is marsh gas, CH4.
Id considerations respecting the fuel value of natural gas, calcula-
tions of its calorific intensity, and of the heat units produced in its
combustion, do not always by themselves give any accurate idea of
its relative practical advantages and economy over other fuels. In com-
paring it with coal, for instance, the statement that one pound of gas is
equivalent to 2.225 pounds of coal, in fuel value, does not by any means
express the relative economy in the use of the two fuels. With the for-
mer we have the constant and considerable expense of handling and of
the ;disposal of residue, which may be entirely dropped out of
account in the case of gas. In point of purity, which is a factor of the
very highest importance in iron and steel work, natural gas has a very
decided advantage, overall but the very,best grades of coal. Cleanli-
ness, convenience, and absolute control of temperature, constitute per-
haps the most decided advantages of natural gas over solid fuels. These
advantages, of course, are shared as well by the artificial gaseous fuels.
The relative values of natural gas and bituminous coal may be repre-
sented by these figures:
1 lb coal — in weight, 25 cubic feet of gas.
1 lb coal has fuel value of 7* cubic feet of gas.
1 lb coal evaporates in boiler 9 lbs. water.
1 lb gas evaporates in boiler 20.3 lbs. water.
These figures, of course, are absolutely correct for only individual
experiments. They serve well enough, however, to show comparative
values under ordinarily favorable circumstances. 1,000 feet of gas is
generally figured as equivalent to 55 pounds of coal, approximately.
As a means of comparison with its rival gaseous fuels, coal gas, water
gas and producer (Siemens Martin) gas, we may figure from the composi-
tion of each, the amount of water each would evaporate under identical
conditions, approaching as near those of practice as is possible. The
results are only relative, as certain losses common to each have not been
eliminated. The result, which is certainly very favorable to natural
gas, is:


53
1,000 feet natural gas — water evaporated, 893 lbs.
1,000 " coal "—" " 591 lbs.
1,000 "• water "—" " 262 lbs.
1,000 " producer " —" " 115 lbs.
It may be noticed that this result of 893 lbs. water for natural gas»
which is a purely theoretical calculation, is quite concordant with the
result given previously, which is from a practical experiment. [1 lb. gas
to 20.3 lbs. water, is 1,000 cu. ft. to 812 lbs.]
As has been already mentioned, the problem of transportation and
distribution of natural gas has been much simplified by the tremendous
pressures under which it is stored in so many cases. These high press-
ures, to be sure, have led to great leakage and waste, but they neverthe-
less constitute a factor of the highest importance in. the utilization of
the gas. At best, the friction of the pipes diminishes the pressure so
rapidly that its commercial distribution is possible for only a rather
limited distance. There are lines of 100 miles and over, but these dis-
tances are excessive, and the average would perhaps fall under twenty-
five, that is, from the well to the point where gas is used. For piping,
cast and wrought iron pipes are employed, varying in diameter from the
thirty-inch mains to the three-inch distributors. It being impossible to
prevent leakage at the joints, it is a common practice to provide escapes
of loosely piled broken stone about the joints, and thus avoid dangerous
accumulations of gas. One of the most effective improvements in
piping gas, consists in enlarging the diameter of the mains, at proper
intervals, as friction reduces the flow. By this means the average
general pressure along the line is lessened, reservoir capacity is provided,
and the flow of gas greatly accelerated. It is claimed that by this
system the volume of gas delivered is enormously in excess of that given
by a pipe of uniform capacity, same cost and length. The practical con-
ditions under which gas is most effectually employed in furnaces, present
no very marked features. However, there are points which need atten-
tion, and the entire neglect of which in the past, has led to most inex-
cusable waste of valuable fuel. In the great steel and iron works of
Pittsburg, for example, the gas has been very generally burned under
entirely too high a pressure, to realize its full fuel value. One and a
half to two-ounce pressure is perhaps the most favorable at which to
effect combustion, while the ratio of air to gae should be, roughly, eight
to one. The fact that natural gas requires more oxygen for its complete
combustion than coal gas does, may be easily demonstrated by a few
simple experiments with a Bunsen burner.


The Technic.
The use of natural gas in the household, under boilers, in glass and
salt works, etc., is illustrative of its great convenience and value as a
fuel, but to fully appreciate its excellence, we are attracted at once to
that king of industries, in which it has been so exceptionally successful,
namely, the manufacture of iron and steel. It is here that any fuel
must undergo the most rigid tests, and be brought most prominently
into comparison with those that rival it in efficiency. Doubtless no other
industry makes so many severe exactions upon a fuel, as does the manu-
facture of iron and steel. The fuel must have a high pyrometric value to
render possible the intense heat required. It must be free from those
impurities that so frequently render an otherwise available fuel abso-
lutely worthless in iron and steel work. Another very important requisite
of a fuel, in iron and steel work, is ease of government or regulation.
That the fuel be capable of maintaining any required heat for any re-
quired time, and that it be capable of quick and certain variations of
temperature, is a highly valuable quality.
Natural gas, as has been shown, nleets all these requirements in a
satisfactory degree, and is now employed in all the processes of iron and
steel manufacture, except smelting. There are no theoretical reasons,
probably, why natural gas could not be employed in the blast-furnace,
provided some solid fuel support were employed with it in the stack,
but as a commercial operation it would be out of the question at present.
It may be remarked in this connection, however, as of historic interest,
that an unsuccessful attempt was made to use it in a blast furnace, at
Erie, Pa., as early as 1874. The gas was blown in through the tuyeres
by its own pressure, but we are not informed as to whether any solid
fuel was used with it to support the charge. It would be, of course,
admirably adapted for burning in the stoves to heat the blast, but the
field here is successfully occupied by the waste furnace gases, which are
generally more than sufficient for the work.
It is chiefly in puddling, reheating and melting furnaces, that the
gas is so extensively used. Under melting furnaces, we include steel
melting furnaces—pot, and open-hearth, and pig melters, all of which
are, in general, on the regenerative plan. In the ordinary puddling fur-
naces, no change was made, as a general rule, on the adoption of gas; it
being piped in through three-eighth inch burners, about on the level of
the bridge, the air entering above, and hence mixing perfectly. This
will give the heat required to puddle iron, but it far from realizes the
full fuel value of the gas. In order to do this, it is absolutely essential
to employ some sort of regenerative furnace. Tests have recently been


55
made with a modified form of the ordinary puddler, in which checker-
work regenerators are employed, and the difference in consumption of
fuel is startling. For a long-ton (2,240 lbs.), of muck-bar, the common
puddler consumed at different heats 24,000, 30,000, 34,000, 39,000. feet of
gas, in round numbers. The furnace with regenerators, for the same
work, consumed at different heats, 12,000, 13.500,15,000 and 16,000 feet.
This shows forcibly some possibilities in the direction of economy.
For the ordinary reheating furnace, natural gas seems about a per-
fect fuel. The requirements of an absolutely even and steady tempera-
ture are perfectly fulfilled, but its use in this connection, perhaps pre-
sents no features of special novelty.
In steel melters,—open-hearth, pot, and modifications, the regenera-
tive principle is employed, and the very highest heats are attained with
ease. In these furnaces the superiority of natural over producer gas is
marked, and is due largely to the great amount of nitrogen (inert) in the
latter. None of these furnaces, however, present any very distinctive
features as a consequence of the employment of natural gas, the modifi-
cations being directed to the perfect mixing and correct proportions of
gas and air for combustion. It will be appreciated, of course, that the
points relating to the economical use of the gas have had no special com-
mercial importance, in and around Pittsburg especially, until very
recently. Whether an iron master used 13,000 feet of gas or 65,000, to
puddle a ton of iron, was practically a matter of indifference to him, as
the cost for fuel was according to product and not according to gas con-
sumed. The redaction of the flow in Pittsburg is now forcing the ques-
tion into prominence, and it is safe to say that the enormous waste that
has been permitted to go on for the last few years will be stopped.
The practical economy in dollars and cents is from these four
sources: reduced fuel cost, reduced labor cost, reduced waste of iron,
reduced cost of repairs. The many points of advantage which cannot
be reckoned in dollars and cents, but which add greatly to the efficiency
and convenience of labor, have already been incidentally mentioned.
In conclusion, we may say of natural gas, in reference to its com-
mercial importance in extensive manufactures, that, from the manner
of its geological occurrence and accumulation, it is to be presumed its
use in the future, however extensive, must be local rather than general.
But at the same time the use of natural gas for the past five years has
unquestionably opened up a new era in fuel economy, and has proven in
no uncertain way that the fuel of the future, if it is to satisfy even our
present ideas of a perfect fuel, must be gaseous and not solid.

SOME INJECTOR TESTS.
The popularity into which steam injectors have sprung of late years,
as boiler feeders, could hardly have been prophesied thirty years ago,
when Henry Jacques Giffard, of Paris, presented the first jet machine to
the public. The fault, then, lay not with the machine but with the
public, who were exceedingly skeptical as to the power of steam taken
from a boiler to raise a quantity of water, heat it through seventy
degrees or more, and then force it back into the same boiler. A knowl-
edge of thermodynamics and an explanation of the principles involved
have done much towards generating the confidence in the machine,
which every one feels who has used one. The essential parts of M.
Giffard's machine are present in every injector, i. e., the steam jet, the
combining tube, and the delivery tube, and the same theory applies
equally well to all injectors. The quantities which must enter into our
equations are readily seen. On one side we shall have the sum of the
total heat of steam used and the calorific equivalent of living force
or kinetic energy imparted by the jet of steam. This must be equated
to the sum of the heat imparted to the delivered water and calorific
equivalent of the work done in forcing the water against the necessary
head. We will make use of the following notation, which M. Leon
Pochet uses in his contribution on Injectors, to the Van Nostrand
Science Series:
y=wt. of water raised by one pound of steam.
J=Joule's equivalent=778.
&gt; —density of delivered water=wt. of one cubic foot.
t=temperature of delivered water.
w=temperature of injection water.
r=latent heat of steam.
r0=temperature corresponding to boiler pressure.
H=total heat of one pound of the steam.
x =proportion of real steam in steam used.
w=velocity of steam in steam jet.
V=velocity of the mixture in delivery tube.
P=boiler pressure by gauge.
From this fundamental equation we may derive the following form
for the proportion of water delivered per pound of steam:
Then,


57
ldt + r0x0
From this equation we may read the three following propositions
concerning the proportion of water conveyed:
1st. The proportion of water increases and therefore the velocity of
the mixture decreases when 8, the temperature of the injection water&gt;
rises.
2nd. The proportion of water increases when r, the temperature of
the mixture, diminishes.
3rd. The proportion of water diminishes when the steam is not dry.
Theoretical discussions, of which this is representative, are most
valuable and as numerous as they are valuable, but there has been a
comparative scarcity of actual tests on injectors. In view of this fact
we have undertaken the test of a number of injectors for the purpose of
obtaining data on their efficiency, both as boiler feeders and as heat
engines, which should be perfectly reliable. Our preparations were
accordingly made with great care. The water supply was taken from a
150 barrel cistern situated 42 feet, horizontally, from the injectors, and
whose bottom was 17 feet below them. The difference of level between
the centre of the injectors and a fixed datum line was carefully taken by
means of a surveyor's level, so that by measuring from this datum line
to the water level, the actual vertical lift could at any time be taken.
The waterwas forced into a 100 barrel tank in the tower of the building,
72 feet 2 inche3 above the injectors, giving a minimum pressure on the
water pressure gauge of 30.5 pounds, when forcing. The discharge pipe
was carried to the top of the tank, allowing the water to flow over it
under a constant head. A water gauge of a length equal to the height
of the tank, was fitted between two upright posts, on which a sliding
block was fitted with a tongue projecting by the side of the tube, so that
readings could be taken with great accuracy. The tank was calibrated
in the following manner: A barrel was mounted on a very accurate Buf-
falo scale, with a valve and pipe leading into it from the discharge pipe
of the tank. Having first filled the tank we proceeded to let out into the
barrel known weights of water, at the same time making markings on
the uprights by the glass gauge. This was done for the full length of
the tank—the temperature of the water being frequently taken. These
weights were reduced to cubic feet by means of D. K. Clark's table of
densities, and the divisions on the scale sub-divided into tenths, so that


The Technic,
knowing the temperature of the water in the tank and the two readings,
by means of the table made out for the tank, we could ascertain at once
the number of pounds forced in. The personal error could in no case
amount to more than one per cent., and in the case of the larger inject-
ors, was probably less than one-fourth of one per cent. Steam was
furnished by a 36 inch vertical, fire-tubular boiler, having 61 tubes, \%
in. diameter and 4 feet 6 inches long. The bottom tube sheet was 22
inches above the grate, which was 30)^ irches in diameter, giving a total
heating surface of 140 square feet. At a test it developed 13 H. P. A
calorimeter test made under the usual conditions obtaining during the
tests, showed an average percentage of moisture of 1.8 per cent. The
connections to the injectors consisted of 18 feet of 1$£ inch pipe, with
throttle valve and suitable connections for steam gauge and calorimeter
tests. The boiler was fed by a No. \% Blake pump which took its suc-
tion from a barrel mounted on a platform scale, so that all the water put
into the boiler could be weighed. It was run by steam from a source
entirely independent of the boiler used in testing. The water pressure
gauge and the steam gauge were both tested and corrections made in
every case. They were connected with special care, so that the steam or
water flowing by might not destroy the accuracy of the results. The
vacuum gauge was connected in the suction pipe nine inches below the
centre of the injector; allowance being made in every case for this dis-
tance. The gauge consisted simply of a bent tube partly filled with mer-
cury, one end being open, the other connected to the suction pipe by a
short rubber tube. The suction could be throttled to any desired extent
by means of an angle valve. AVe could produce any desired head against
which to force by means of a globe valve in the delivery pipe. A ther-
mometer, which had been tested and found correct within .08 of a degree,
was screwed into an ordinary T fitting, thus completing the arrange-
ments. I propose to describe the test on a No. 5 "Monitor" injector,
having a rated capacity at 00 pounds steam pressure, of 090 gallons per
hour. The smallest diameter of the delivery tube was sv inches, and all
the connections were \}4 inch. The first test was for the purpose of
determining the point of maximum efficiency when run with constant
steam pressure and variable head against which it was necessary to
force. This series consisted of six tests of one-half hour each, readings
being taken every five minutes. The following is the series:

Surely these are most encouraging results, especially as regards the
percentage of heat units utilized, when we consider that the ordinary
pump only utilizes about 2 % of the available heat units. But conclu-
sive as these results would seem to be, they may lead to erroneous con-
clusions. Consider the fact that in the injector you are using steam of
a high pressure —and therefore available for driving an engine or doing
other work —for the purpose of heating water, which, though a valua-
ble service, can just as well be done by low pressure or exhaust steam.
This exhaust steam would be useless for the purpose for which the live
steam is available and unless used in a feed-water heater would be
thrown away; therefore we throw away the higher pressure of the
steam in the injector. In the case, however, of an exhaust steam
injector, or where no feed-water heater is available, or where the
exhaust steam can be used for other purposes, as for heating, there is
decided economy in the use of an injector. The average steam press-
ure for the last series was 62.0166 lbs. A curve could now very easily
be plotted which would show at a glance the point of maximum duty.
In this curve the ordinates could be foot-pounds of work per pound of
steam, and the abscissas, head forced against. It will be noticed in this
series that the point of maximum duty is just beyond the point repre-
senting 73 tt&gt;s. head to force against. The greatest ratio between
water and steam exists at about the same point, while the curve for the
percentage of heat units utilized undulates, having a maximum between


The Technic.
60 lbs. and 70 lb3. head, while its highest point is at 102.5 lbs. head. It
was not determined whether this latter point is a maximum or not, as
this pressure of delivery seemed to be the maximum against which
68.64 lbs. pressure of steam would force. Considered as a heat engine sim-
ply the efficiency or percentage of heat units utilized in work for these
tests are .122 %, .162 %,.2332 %, .2393 %, .211 % and .212 % respectively.
A series of three tests was now run with a lower pressure of steam, i. e.,
44.6 lbs. against 30.5 ft&gt;3., 42 lbs. and 62 lbs., head respectively. For these
heads of water the ratios of water forced to steam consumed were res-
pectively 13, 12.6 and 9.35, the duty 1,151,670, 1,474,960 and 1,610,930 ft.
lbs. and the efficiency as a boiler feeder under the two last conditions
97.5 % and 84.78 %. These tests show that the quantity of water forced
per pound of steam and the foot-pounds of work per pound of steam
are both a maximum at nearly the same point, i. e., where the steam
pressure and the pressure forced against are most nearly equal. These
of course are the conditions that obtain, in feeding a boiler with steam
from the same boiler. This injector as made has the water supply-
valve in itself, and during all these tests it was necessary to throttle
the water supply excessively as it would not have been necessary, prob-
bably, on shorter lifts. This being so we had no way of knowing the
vaccuum which existed in the machine itself, in the chamber surround-
ing the steam jet. Now, however, we opened this valve wide and
throttled the water supply on the other side of the vaccuum gauge,
until the machine was just on the point of sucking air, and ran two
tests with 53.5 lbs. of steam against 30.5 lbs. and 60.5 lbs. respectively,
the vaccuum gauge showing the equivalent of 16.93 feet lift and 16.14 lift
respectively. An efficiency of 81.91 &lt;/c and 93.6 % respectively was
obtained. As matter of interest merely, we tested the injector for max-
imum lift by throttling the suction to imitate a high lift until the jet
would get very uncertain. The head forced against was 30.5 lbs. The
law of the machine is very plain from the following results: At 60 lbs.
of steam the maximum lift attained was 14.683 feet. At 50 lbs. it was
17.5 feet, at 40 lbs. it was 20.331 feet, at 37.5 lbs. it was 22.02 feet. With
falling steam pressure a lift of 13.69 feet was overcome down to 24 lbs.
of steam pressure, when the jet broke. "We tested the machine for
limits with hot water on a lift of 3 ft. 6 inches. At 57 lbs. of steam the
maximum temperature to start with was found to be 138' F. At 47 lbs.
steam it forced against the same pressure with temperature of suction
138° and temperature of discharge 194°. We found also that with the
pressure tested a given steam pressure would force against about twice-
its own pressure.


61
The following is an application of some data obtained from a Gor-
don Duplex pump run under the same conditions as one of the injector
tests, i. e., 53.5 lbs. steam pressure forcing against 50 lbs. head or 133.98
feet of water. In the pump the steam cylinder was 6 inches diameter,
and the plungers were 4 inches diameter. While running at 50 revolu-
tions per minute, with length of stroke 1% in. the pump gave a duty of
12,781,180, the ratio of water forced to steam used being 90.3 and its effi-
ciency as a heat engine only .792 %. If we assume that the pump
forces its water through an exhaust feed-water heater, we may find the
number of heat units gained by a pump in feeding W pounds of water
over an injector by means of the following formula, given by Prof. D. S.
in which, in addition to the preceding notation, R = ratio of water
forced to steam used in the injector, Dp and D1 = the duty per 100 lbs.
coal in the pump and injector respectively, and v = the volume of one
pound of steam at boiler pressure. Substituting, we find that in feeding
90.3 lbs. of water the pump gains 4896.77 heat units, or every pound of
steam in the injector loses 764 heat units, when compared with a pump
working with an exhaust feed-water, heater or the injector is 90.44 % as
efficient as the pump. Other considerations, however, may modify this
result. Eenest B. Pekry, '89.
The theoretical determination of average haul is not difficult to
understand, but it is not easy to find a practical method of calculating
it. Overhaul may be defined as the distance through which material is
moved beyond a certain fixed limit; the fixed limit varying on different
roads and under different engineers.
At least three reasons may be given why material from cuts should
be placed in embankments or at least below grade; first, to save expense;
second, to prevent wastebanks above grade; third, to make a better
embankment than could be made from borrow pits alone. The first is
often the only one considered, but on first-class work the other two are
more important. The average haul for each yard is the distance between
the oentre of gravity of the portion of the cut in question and the cen-
tre of gravity of the embankment made from it. The main features of
Jacobus:
OVERHAUL.


The Technic.
the following demonstration are taken from "Formulae for Railroad
Earthwork and Average Haul" by J. W. Davis. If V represents a cubic
yard of material, d the distance (in units of 100 feet) moved, then V d =
the equivalent number of yards moved 100 feet. If d dlt etc., da
represent the distance each succeeding yard is moved (as above), the
entire volume moved reduced to an equivalent volume moved 100 feet
= V (d + dx + di + etc. dn) or V 2 d. Or if we consider the vol-
ume divided into an infinite number of equal volumes and represent
each by d V and the distance each volume is hauled, to a plane trans-
verse to the centre line between cut and fill, by the variable x, the total
haul would be jxdV. There must be a distance which, if each vol-
ume be considered as hauled that distance, will give the same as
the above. Let this average distance be represented by x', then
x' jdV= JaxiV. Integrating the first member and dividing by V, it
fxdV
becomes x'— . The second member of the last equation is the
V
expression for the distance of the centre of gravity from the plane. If
the fill be calculated in the same way, the average haul of the excava-
tion will be the distance from the centre of gravity of the excavation to
the centre of gravity of the fill.
In the free haul limit each yard is supposed to be placed as near as
possible to its point of excavation, so that only the last yard is supposed
to be hauled the full limit. This is the method usually employed by
engineers to calculate overhaul. As it would be impossible to calculate
each yard from the place of excavation to the place of deposit, it is
necessary to adopt other methods. The corresponding prisms in cut
and fill are not equal, hence the total haul of each prism can not well be
found. It may be obtained by taking some fixed point, say the centre
grade point or station nearest, calculating the distance from the centre
of gravity of each prismoid in the cut to this point, multiplying each
distance by the number of cubic yards in its prism, and then from this
point making the same calculations for each prismoid in the fill: the
sum will be the required haul. The centre of gravity of these prisms is
not midway between the end sections, but always closer to the greater
area, and in rolling country there is usually the same error in both cut
and fill, the effect of which is to reduce the haul; since the larger areas
are farthest from the grade point in both cut and fill (within haul limits).
This is not usually a compensating, but a multiplying error.
The limits of haul are the first facts to be determined: this depends


63:
entirely upon the terms of the contract under which one is working.
Some engineers prefer to fix arbitrary limits and consider several classi-
fications, as follows: first, all material from excavation which can be
deposited in embankment within a feet shall be paid for in excavation
alone, without haul; second, all material from excavation which can be
deposited in embankment within 6 fret (and not within a feet) shall be
paid for as excavation hauled, plus haul; third, all material, etc.,
within cfeet (and not within b feet) may have a different price, and thus
it may continue to the desired number of classifications. As there are
different means used for hauling different distances, such as drag
scrapers, wheel scrapers, wagons, carts, and cars, this seems to be a very
just classification.
Suppose the contract contains the following clause, " In all cases
work will be estimated so as to make the least cost; that is, earth from
excavations will be estimated as having been hauled to such a point
that the price for earth excavation 'hauled' plus the price for 'haul of
earth,' shall equal the price for 'excavation wasted' plus the price for
'embankment borrowed.'" The limits are then determined from the
different prices paid. Overhaul may be paid for the entire distance
hauled, or for the entire distance less the free haul distance. Probably
the majority of engineers prefer the former, so this discussion will be
confined to that case. The limit for earth may be found as follows:
Let A=priee of embankment borrowed, B=price of excavation hauled,
c=price of excavation wasted, D~price of haul of earth; then a+c=
a+c —b
b + d, or the limit of haul must = . If c and b are equal, as

they often are, this reduces to, —. This does not take into consideration.
D
expansion, which is quite frequently omitted entirely. If loose rock
expands 20% and solid rock expands 50%, 100 yards of loose rock would
make 120 yards of embankment and 100 yards of solid rock would make
150 yards of embankment. In general, if x equals 100% plus the per-
XA
centage of expansion, the haul limit would then be . I have demon-
D
strated this very simple proposition because a large number of engineers

overlook expansion entirely and consider the limit in all cases as —.

Another addition to this limit might be made from the fact that rock
will stand at a much steeper slope than earth, thus giving a smaller
cross-section for the embankment. But if a rock bank is topped out.


The Technic.
with earth, or if the two are thrown in together, the usual amount of
expansion can not be depended upon, as most of the interstices left by
the rock are filled with earth. In high embankments made from borrow
pits only about ten or twelve feet of the bottom is hauled less than 100
feet. If all earth, whether in excavation or embankment, hauled more
than 100 feet, be classed as "embankment borrowed," the tops of high
embankments would not be paid for as "embankment borrowed," and
thus another factor would enter into the determination of haul.

each yard moved equal to excavation wasted plus embankment bor-
rowed, and there is no saving in expense. If part of a cut falls without
the haul limit (or if the centre of the cut lies between the limits calcu-
lated each way) the contractor may, according to the strict letter of the
contract, be compelled to waste only that portion which falls without
the haul limit; but as a heavy waste bank in a short space is usually
worse than the same amount of material distributed along the entire
length of the cut, the engineer often allows the top of nearly the entire
length of the cut to be wasted, thus makiDg a slightly longer haul for
part of the material, but calculates the quantities according to the
wording of the contract. Embankment may be calculated in the same
way; that is, the base of the embankment for its entire length may be
borrowed, instead of borrowing just the quantity without the haul
limit.
In rock cuts with earth on top, the earth should always be removed
first, so that the rock may be re-cross-sectioned. In this case, the haul of
each should be calculated separately, as the two would naturally be kept
separate in building the bank. There is no end to the number of specific
cases that may arise, in which the engineer can follow no fixed rules, but
must be guided by his own good judgment as to what is justice to all
parties concerned.
Mr. J. W. Davis in his formulae for railroad earthwork gives the fol-
lowing rules when part of the excavation is wasted and the balance
placed in fill: "In such a case determine the average haul I of the whole
volume V, as before, as if every cubic yard had been transported to the
ascertained centre of gravity of fill. Let V denote the portion carried
to the spoil bank as measured in monthly estimates. Let V be the dis-
tance from the centre of gravity V, also determined in monthly esti-
mates, to the centre of gravity of the waste bank. Let I" be the dis-


65
tance from centre of gravity of V to centre of gravity of fill and let V"
represent the average haul of the portion of the cutting, V— V, that was
really carried to fill, then I V = I" V + V" (V — V). This is the amount
of haulage as first calculated, the true amount is V V + V" (V— V).
Subtracting the false from the true we have for a correction (J,' — I")
V'\ this is naturally always negative. The true haulage is, therefore,
IV —(I"—I') V." He gives the following formulae for finding the
average haul when part of an embankment is borrowed: "Knowing the
quantity V brought to the fill from borrow pit, and its centre of gravity
assume an axis. Let V be the distance of the centre of gravity V from
this axis. Let V represent the entire part of fill to which material from
road bed cutting has been carried, and whose centre of gravity has been
determined as before. Let I denote the distance of this point from the
axis. Then V — V is the portion actually hauled from cut, and its cen-
IV—I'V
tre of gravity is distant from the axis I" = . Since the centre
V — V
of gravity of V — V is the terminus of the average haul distance of
road bed cutting, measure off I" from the axis and from the point thus
determined measure the distance of the centre of gravity of the cut to
obtain the true average haul." The above formulae are very nice as
theories, but it seems there is too much machinery for practical pur-
poses. If there is overhaul on the portion wasted the first formula fails,
for that is only for that portion of the excavation placed in embank-
ment. It might do very well when the waste is measured in the waste
bank, but the only satisfactory way to measure that material is to meas-
ure the portion remaining. It would seem unnecessary to calculate the
centre of gravity of any besides the latter. The haul limit can not be
determined very well until the waste is taken off and the balance
remeasured, and then it is simply a question of determining the centre
of gravity of the cut as finally measured. The formulae to be used when
part of the fill is borrowed, is a little more simple but still open to objec-
tions.
Having given some of the theories in regard to haul, I will give
some of the methods used in actual practice. Having determined the
limits of extreme haul from the contract, the first thing to do is to bal-
ance cut and fill or find the limits on the profile. This has to be done by
trial. Suppose the limit to be 1,200 feet; the problem is to find two
points, one in cut the other in fill, 1,200 feet apart, such that the amount
in cut will exactly make that portion of the fill to the limit, after correc-
tions for expansion, etc., have been applied. If all of a cut is to be
5


The Technic.
hauled, part each way, and the extreme limit is not reached, then it is
simply a question of dividing it the most economically before calcula-
ting the haul. The only accurate way for calculating haul is the centre
gravity method. One of the most inaccurate methods and probably the
one most commonly used in practice is to find the centre of quantity of
cut and fill and to take the distance between the two as the average
haul. In rolling country where cuts are divided near the summit, this
always gives too large a result, for in a prism with unequal end areas,
the centre of quantity is always further from the smaller section than
the centre of mass. In rough work the errors may compensate to a cer-
tain extent. This is a very easy method and, if only an approximation
is desired, it is a very good one. Another common method is to take the
centre of each prismoid as the centre of quantity. This, in the first class
of work mentioned above, always gives too small a quantity, but as in the
first method the errors in this also may compensate. It is probably more
nearly correct than the former. Another method is to take each pris-
moid in the cut, see how much fill it will make, calculate the distance
between centres, or centres of gravity, of the two prismoids, and multi-
ply this distance by the number of yards. This seems unnecessary, for
it may very properly be said that each cross-sectioned prismoid in cut
never equals the corresponding prismoid in fill and would, therefore,
cause a large amount of unnecessary work.
We will now look at some of the accurate methods. On page 244 of
Searles' Field Engineering is found the following: "The distance of
the centre of gravity of a prismoid from its midsection is expressed by
P(A—A')
the formula x= . If we replace S by its approximate value
12X27 S
l(A+A')
, which will produce no important error in this case, we have
2X27
I A—A'
x — , in which A should always represent the more remote area
6A+A'
from the starting point. Hence x may be + or — and must be applied
with its proper sign to the distance of the mid-section from the starting
point before multiplying by the contents, &amp;."
Professor J. B. Davis gives the following formula for finding the
1 B—A I
centre of gravity of a prismoid: xs = 1 , in which
2 A+B+4C 2
xA equals the distance of the centre of gravity from one end; A and B


67
are the two end areas, C the middle area, and I the length of the prismoid.
This is more accurate than Searles' second formula, but not so simple.
There has been a great deal of time spent in formulating rules for find-
ing the centre of gravity, both analytically and graphically, of a number
of prismoids. In the case of haul there is no necessity for finding the
centre of gravity of all the prismoids. It is the total haul and not the
average haul of the mass that is sought. To find the total haul when
the centre of gravity of each prismoid is known, pass an imaginary
plane through any convenient point near the centre grade point, multiply
the mass of each prismoid in cut and fill by the distance (divided by the
unit length of haul) of its centre of gravity from the plane and add the
results: this sum is the equivalent number of yards hauled unit distance.
The analytical expression for finding the centre of gravity of a number
2mx
of masses is well known to be xg = .
2m
Let us consider two graphical methods for finding the centre of
gravity of a number of masses lying in the same plane, the distance of
the centre of gravity of each from a point in the plane being known.
We will suppose the centre of gravity to lie in a line. The first method
is due to Professor J. B. Davis of the University of Michigan.
In this special case, see Fig. 1, represent the masses by Vi, V2, V3, V4,
V5, V6, and the positions of their centres of gravity by vlt v2&lt; va, vit vs,
v6. At v2 draw a perpendicular below the line equal, by some scale, to
Vj, from »j draw a perpendicular equal to v2 above the line, connect
the extremities of these two lines; where this line intersects the initial
line draw a perpendicular above equal to v3, at v3 draw a line below
equal to VH-Vj, connect the extremities of the last two lines aad pro-
ceed as before, so that the last line will connect v6, drawn from v5 above
the line, with V1+V2+V3+V4+V5, drawn from from v6 below the line.
The intersection of this line with the initial line will be the centre of
gravity of the masses. If the centre of gravity be thus found in cut
and fill the average haul of the entire mass will be the distance between
the centres of gravity.
The second is the equilibrium poloygon method. This may be famil-
iar to some, but it will do no harm to repeat it here for those who have
not seen it. (For the demonstration see " Trusses and Arches, Graphical
Method, by Prof. C. E. Greene, Part II, Page 23). See Fig. 2. As above,
represent the masses by v„V9 etc., and the positions of their centre of
gravity by vt v2 v3 etc., from these points let fall perpendiculars indefinite;


The Technic.
in length. From any convenient
point, at the right or left, lay off the
masses, to scale, on a line perpendic-
ular to the initial line in order from
the top down as the masses occur,
beginning with the one nearest the
initial line, calling the points of
division v1, v", etc.,- - v"'t V', v/.
Assume any point o and draw lines
from v1 — v'', t&gt;' to o. Beginning
with the line at the outside of the end prism nearest the load line draw
a line parallel to o »' terminating at the perpendicular through from
this point draw a parallel to o v6 terminating at the perpendicular
through »5. Proceed in the same way drawing lines parallel to each of
the lines radiating from o; prolong the lines parallel to o »7 and o«'; at
the point of intersection erect a perpendicular to the initial line, then
the intersection of the last perpendicular and the initial line will be the


69
centre of gravity of the system of masses. As these are graphical meth-
ods their degree of accuracy depends upon the accuracy of the drawing.
Excellent results may be obtained if care is taken with the drawing and
a sufficiently large scale be used. Cross section paper may be used to
advantage.
I have assumed the following centre heights in cut and fill, and cal-
culated the haul by three of the different methods just to show the dif-
ferences existing among them. Sta. 4, cut 22 ft. 5, c 20 ft. 6, c
16 ft. 7, c 14 ft. 8, c 8 ft. 9, c 6 ft. 10, grade 11, fill 4 ft.
12, f 6 ft. 13, f 10 ft. 14, f 14 ft. 15, f 16 ft. 16, f 18 ft.
■ 17, f 20 ft.; this is the relative shape of cuts and fills often occurring
in rolling country. The centre of gravity of each prismoid was calcula-
1 B—A I
ted by the formula xg= 1 •. The centre of gravity of the
2 A+B+iC 2
cut. by the formula xe = , is 378.9 + feet from an assumed plane at
station 10, that of the fill is 351.2 feet from the same plane.
By the first graphical method, cut 378.9 feet fill 450 feet.
""second" ""378.8" "450.8"'
The number of cubic yards between the limits of haul are 8,484.7, so
we have 8,484.7 yards hauled 830.1 + feet equals 70,435 yards hauled 100
feet. (The haul by the graphical methods has not been calculated as
they agree so nearly with the analytical method). By taking the centre
of each prism as its centre of gravity we have 69,950 yards. By taking
the distance between the centres of quantity of cut and fill as the aver-
age haul, we have 74,566 yards. The first two methods differ only by
about 500 yards, while the last differs from the first by more than 4,000
yards.
Since there is such a wide difference in the methods of calculating
overhaul, would it not be well to specify in the contract how haul should
be calculated? The contractor could then bid on the work accordingly.
There is no doubt but that the centre of gravity method is the only
acccurate one, theoretically, but how many division engineers have the
time to go through such minute calculations for an item relatively
small? It involves working a large number of areas where they are of
no account whatever in computing the cubical contents, and in one of
the formula given, necessitates calculating the middle areas.

RELATIVE ECONOMY OF STAND-PIPE AND TRESTLE-
TOWER FOR WATER WORKS.
Ia pursuing the investigation upon which this article is founded,
the writer has carefully designed a stand-pipe and trestle-tower inclu d-
ing all details, under assumed conditions which are applicable to most
of our western cities of moderate size, so many of which have erected
stand-pipes similar to the one here described. The two structures will
first be considerad separately and then the results will be compared in
detail.
STAND-PIPE.
The pipe designed by the writer is 120 feet in height by 20 feet in
diameter, and has a capacity of 29,374 IT. S. gallons. The material is
wrought iron plate of the best quality arranged in horizontal courses of
four feet in height, and of plates 7 feet 10% inches net length.
The allowable stresses which have been assumed in its design are
as follows:
Safe Working Strength for Tension —f= 15,000 lbs, per sq. in.
•' Compression = c = 12.000" " '•"
"Shear =s= 9,000" " ""
These assumptions were thought to agree well with the best prac-
tice under like conditions. The thickness of plates, size and pitch of
rivets, with their number and arrangement, were determined by the
formula
pr = As = tdc = t (p — d)/
in which A = area of section of rivet in inches; t = thickness of plate
in inches; d = diameter of rivet in inches; p = pressure in pounds
per square inch, and r = radius of pipe in inches. The results are tabu-
lated by courses, beginning at the bottom.

For the horizontal joints only one row of rivets was found to be
necessary, and their distribution was as follows:

To sustain the pipe aguinst a wind pressure due to an assumed
velocity of 90 miles per hour, twelve two-inch anchor bolts were placed
at equal intervals around the circumference and extended through the
masonry. To prevent the collapsing of the upper portion of the pipe
two rings, three inches in width by one-half inch in thickness, were
placed around the circumference, one of them being at the top and the
other four feet lower.
The masonry is to be of coursed sandstone with a top course of
limestone, octagonal in plan, upper surface 480 square feet in area and
the bottom area 644 square feet. The depth, of six feet, was figured as
being amply sufficient to prevent the settling of the structure and the
injurious action of the frost. Under the masonry is placed a layer of
concrete one foot in depth.
The pipe is to be provided with a light ladder on the outside, and all
iron work, whether exposed to the weather or not, is to be given three
coats of Iron-Clad paint.
The bill of materials includes everything with the exception of
transportation and profits of contractors.

TRESTLE-TOWER.
The trestle-tower consists of a tank 33 feet in height by 20 feet in
diameter, supported on a trestle of four inclined posts with four panels
of bracing'. The Height of the trestle proper is 92 feet, making a total
height including the tank of 125 feet, or the same as that of the stand-
pipe. The breadth of base is 49 feet, giving a batter to the posts of one
in four. The tank proper is identical with the upper 33 feet of the stand-
pipe and needs no description. It has a bottom of one-quarter inch plate
iron and is supported on floor timbers which rest on a system of girders,
these being supported directly by the posts. The general plan and
arrangement of parts composing the tower is similar to that of the
trestle-tower built some years since for the water works at Princeton, N.
J. Each post rests on a masonry pedestal four feet square on top and
seven and one-half feet square at the bottom, with a depth of seven feet.
The posts are anchored to the foundation by one-inch rods.
The batter and width of base may seem rather excessive, but the
width of base as here given is the least allowable to satisfy the condi-


73
tion, that there shall at no time be any tension in the posts on the wind-
ward side.
In determining the stresses the same assumptions in regard to wind
pressure were made as in the case of the stand-pipe. The tower is to be
provided with a wroughtiron ladder and thoroughly painted.
The struts were calculated by Gordon's formula, the safe working
strength for compression being assumed as 12,000 pounds per square inch.
In the case of both stand-pipe and tower ten per cent, was added to
the weight of plate-iron for lap and rivets, the weight thus obtained be-
ing given in the bills of material.

Of course the capacity of the tank of the trestle-tower is but little
more than one-fourth that of the stand-pipe, but it has the same head of
pressure due to elevation, and performs all the functions of the stand-
pipe in the way of reducing shocks in the mains which would result
from the direct pressure system. The water in the lower part of a stand-
pipe is thought to serve no useful purpose, and to be a source of incon-
venience rather than otherwise.
The approximate cost of the Stand-pipe as given by the bill of ma-
terial is $6,700, and the cost of the Trestle-tower $4,300. These results
show at least in the present case the superiority of the trestle-tower in
almost every particular in point of economy.
Had a less expensive class of masonry been used the difference in cost
would have been reduced somewhat, but reference to the figures will show
that the cost of iron for the pipe was $3,480, while that of the tower was
only $2,130, or a difference of about one-third in favor of the tower.
The labor of erection is assumed as the same in both cases, but a
difference of a large per cent, either way in labor would have but small
effect on the ratio existing between the costs of the two structures. For
■different heights of structures the differences in cost will vary, but when
the trestle is used the odds will always be in its favor over a stand-pipe
of equal height and size.
These results are, in the opinion of the writer, sufficient to prove
that the trestle-tower is to be preferred to the stand-pipe in every case
where economy is a point to be considered, and as for appearance and
•durability the trestle-tower ought certainly to hold its own.
H. S. Crocker, '89.


MISCELLANEOUS NOTES.
-Some Eesults of Experiments with Model of Twenty-One
Foot Steam Launch.
The object of the experiments was to find the I. H. P. necessary to
/propel the boat at a given speed.
The following is a short description of the boat:
Length on load water line 21 ft.
Breath on load water line 4 ft. 3 in.
Draught to load water line 13 in.
Displacement to load water line 2,73(1 lbs.
Co-efficient of fineness 49
Co-efficient of water lines 585
Pounds per inch of immersion 325
The water lines were very nearly Ilankine's " Neoid."
The model was made of white pine, to scale of %, in the usual man-
ner. That is: A board was planed to a thickness equal to the distance
between water planes, and upon this board the water lines were drawn
to the given scale. The spaces inclosed by these water lines were then
■ cut out and placed one upon the other in the order of the wrater lines
upon them. The model was then shaved down to the edges representing
the water lines and finished with shellac.
Dr. Froude, the celebrated English experimenter, has made many
extended experiments with models, the results of which he has given in
the following rule: "If a ship be D times the dimensions of a model and
if at speeds Vt, Va of the model the resistance is R„ B„ then for speeds
Yi \/D. V2 y' D of the ship the resistance will be D3 Pi, D3 B2."
From the resistance of the ship the I. H. P. necessary to drive it at a
given speed can be computed.
The apparatus used by Dr. Froude was a long tank, upon the edges
of which was a car that could be made to travel along the tank at differ-
■ent speeds. The model was fastened to the car and a dynamometer used
to give the resistance.


The Technic.
Having neither car nor tank we had recourse to the current of the
Huron River, or instead of having the model pass through the water, we
let the water pass by the model. To do this several places on the river
were found where the cross section and hence the velocity was uniform
for a considerable distance. The velocity was found by timing floating
objects over a carefully measured distance. The model was held in the
current by a fine thread, one end of which was attached to the model,
and the other to a delicate spring balance.
The resistance due to a speed equal to the velocity of current was
then taken from the balance. This was repeated in several places for
different velocities of current.
The results are given in the following table:

rentper hour

The "resistance of boat" column was found from resistance of
model by Froude's rule, as given above. The column of experimental
I. H. P. was found by multiplying the resistance of boat as found from
the model by the space passed over per hour in feet and dividing by
33,000 X 60. The column of computed I. H. P. was found by Kirke's
method, which is as follows: Kirke assumed that for boats of ordinary
lines, five I. H. P. was necessary for every 100 square feet of wetted
surface driven at ten knots per hour, and also that the I. H. P. increased
or decreased as the cube of the speed. Hence, (T* )3 X Ths X wetted
surface = I. H. P., where x is any given speed in knots.
The experimental I. H. P. differs from the computed I. H. P., being
smaller below six knots and greater above.
If curves be drawn to convenient scale, having for abscissas the
speed in knots and for ordinates the I. H. P., it would be noticed that
for speeds from two to three and one-half knots the inclination of the
curve of experimental I. H. P. to the X axis is less than the inclination-
of the curve of computed I. H. P., showing that the experimental I. H.P.
does not vary as the cube of the speed, as was assumed in the computed"
I. H. P., but that it varies as some lower power of the speed. From
three and one-half to four and one-half knots the inclinations of the-


77
two curves are about the same, or here the curve of experimental I. H. P.
does vary as cube of speed. Above four and one-half knots the curve of
experimental I. H. P. varies as some higher power of the speed than the
cube, or in other words, the curve of experimental I. H. P. approaches
the curve of computed I. H. P., crossing at about six knots.
The cause of the rise in the curve of experimental I. H. P. may be
explained as follows: The boat being but twenty-one feet long on water
line can run at a speed of V*£ x | or 5-3 knots per hour, with economy,
since at that speed the wave length is exactly the length of the boat, or the
crest of the following wave is at the stern post, and its forward pressure
will wholly or partially balance the backward pressure of the bow wave.
If the speed be increased the length and height of the wave will be
increased, bringing the following wave some distance astern, and hence
its forward pressure will be lost,—thus making a high wave-making
resistance in addition to the usual frictional resistance.

A Word Arout Track-Laying.
Expansion.—Experiment shows that the change of length for a 30
foot rail between —40° and + 120° P., will be % of an inch. Actual
practice proves that, if rails are laid at or below zero, we must give them
a full yz inch expansion or they will become so tight when the ther-
mometer stands at 90°, that pieces will have to be cut from the rail to
make room for the expansion. We leave it with the reader to decide
whether it is a flaw in the formula or a flow in the rail that causes the
discrepancy.
Curving Rails.—The apparatus for curving rails ranges from the
primitive arrangement of having 15 or 20 men stand on the rail when
supported at the ends, to the three roller rail curver kept in motion by a
steam engine. It would seem as though no curving would be needed on
curves under 4° or 1,433 feet radius, as the middle ordinate for a curve
of this radius, using a 30 foot rail, is only ^", but actual experiment
proves conclusively that a curve will keep in better line and surface, and
ride easier when the rails are permanently and properly bent, than when
they are laid straight and forced into the arc of a circle by use of the
lining bar. The curving machine consists of three rollers arranged in a
frame so that the middle one can be moved back and forth to give the
required curvature. This machine gives the rail the same curvature


The Technic.
throughout, and makes a very smooth curve. It is especially useful in
curving rails for the lead rails of switches.
A substitute for this machine is the curving hook. This is simply a
lever. The rail to be curved is laid on its side, the ends resting on two
ties which in turn rest on another rail placed workways. The curving
hook passes through a clevis which is attached to the lower rail; by
pressing down on the hook lever the rail is bent first at the quarters and
then at the centre, if necessary. This method really forms the curve by
introducing a series of kinks into the rail. Another method is to pick
up the rail and drop it on a tie and trust to luck to get the proper amount
of curvature. Good results can be obtained with iron or steel rails under
56 lbs. weight, by laying the rail on its side on two ties and then having
a dozen men stand on it and strike it with a sledge. These methods are
not desirable, but are infinitely better than placing straight rails on
curves. The roller curver is also made for use by hand and requires a
foreman and eight men to work it. The rail is placed workways on some
ties. The axle of the middle roller has a long lever attached and the
men walk around the machine while the machine moves along the rail.
Gauging Track.— The standard gauge is 4' %%'' for track and
the standard distance between flanges of wheels is about 4' 7%",
giving % inch for play of the wheels. You will see from this&gt;
that it is no harm to use a gauge TV or 18 inch too long or short, but
it is imperative that the same gauge should always be used. If the track
is out of gauge the entire error is thrown into the line of one sido, as
trackmen line only one rail and gauge the other. The distance from the
main track gauge line on a frog to the outside of the opposite guard
rail on main track or siding, should be 4 feet 6?4' inches, and is not
dependent on the gauge.
The gauge should be wider on curves than on straight track, 4 feet
8?4 inches for 3 curves and 4 feet 9 inches for 5° to 10° curves.

A Protractor Triangle.
In this exact and scientific age not only the best methods of
doing work are considered, but those tools and intruments which aid
the workman in accomplishing his task in the easiest and most economi-
cal way, are sought after in every trade and profession. Especially is
this true of the engineer, and inventions are continually being brought

The Technic.
out which are designed to make his work more exact, his task less diffi-
cult, and of shorter duration.
One of the most important branches of an engineer's work is the
draughting, and as this is the kind of work that requires much time at
best, anything which will help to shorten it, is appreciated by him.
Aside from the drawing board, T square and compasses, he uses
oftenerthan any other instruments, the 45° and 30" by 60° triangles, but
there are many cases where it is convenient to have triangles different
from the standard ones. As a set of triangles covering all possible
necessary angles would require a great number which would be cumber-
some to use, protractors, swivel head T squares and other devices are
used to take their place. The protractor about to be described is
designed to be used like an ordinary triangle, and has the advantage of
being adjustable so that any possible required angle can be obtained, its
use making unnecessary a swivel head T square or any other troublesome
appliance of that kind.
The instrument is made of hard rubber i86 in. thick and has two main
parts, A andB, as shown. Fig. 1 is an outside view; Fig. 2, a longitu-
dinal section; Fig. 3, a cross section through the centre; and Fig. 4, the
segment for making fine adjustments with vernier. A is the movable
ruler along the edge of which the angles are obtained; B, the holding
frame or guide which is placed against the T square blade when in use.
The method of holding these two pieces together is shown in Fig. 3:
the circular edge of A has V-shaped grooves fitting over corresponding
elevations on the edge of B; the washer E has also a V-shaped groove
fitting the corresponding edge of the slot in the frame, B, so that when
the clamping nut, D, is tightened against the washer, E, it forces the
thin sides of B against the tougue, L, projecting from A, and forms a
firm joint.
A segment, C, of thin sheet steel, having a tangent screw, H, on one
end, is placed in a notch, C, cut from the side of the tongue.L, and the
tightening of the nut, D, fastens this segment to the ruler, A, so that a
means of fine adjustment of the ruler is secured by the screw, H, and the
nut, G. The nuts, D and G, are included between the sides of the instru-
ment, and there is therefore nothing projecting from either side to pre-
vent its being used either side up, like an ordinary triangle.
In using the instrument all angles between 0° and 45° are found by
placing the long side of the frame against a T square blade, the angles read-
ing from left to right; for larger angles, or from 45" to 90°, the short side
of the frame is placed against the T square and angles are read from right


81
to left as the double set of figures on the graduated arc indicates. The
graduation is to 30', but with the vernier, angles can be read to three min-
utes of arc. The tables stamped upon the sides (the small one below Fig. 1
being placed on the reverse side) are useful in saving the draftsman the
trouble of looking up or computing each time those angles which occur
most frequently in drawing the thread of screws, tapers for drill shanks,
lathe centres, piston rods, etc., and in drawing the whole or a part of the
perimeter of the ordinary geometrical polygons, without spacing off the
number of sides on the circumference of a circle, as is commonly
necessary. C. E. DePuy, '91.
Direct Pressure Water Supply.
In the designing and operating of direct pressure systems of water
supply for small towns, some very interesting conditions frequently arise
that are not to be met with elsewhere. In such a system we may meet
with the following requirements. A domestic supply of 300 gallons per
minute at 50 lbs. pressure and a fire supply of 1,200 gallons per minute at
120 lbs. pressure; the former to be maintained continuously, the latter
not more than six hours per month.
These conditions are usually met by putting in an engine with
variable cut-off, or else a compound pump arranged to admit live steam
to the low pressure cylinders, thus acting as a non-expansive engine on
Are service. This latter is a very satisfactory and economical arrange-
ment for a small town, but it will readily be seen that it will make
excessive demands upon the boiler plant at the outbreak of a fire. From
the fact that the quantity of water required in case of fire is four times
that required for domestic service it is evident that the piston speed will
be increased four times, and hence, without considering increase of
pressure, four times as much steam will be used.
As on domestic service the fires will be ordinarily banked, the result
of an alarm of fire is generally a decided fall of boiler pressure, and
hence it is that the live steam connection to the low pressure cylinder is
considered so valuable, but this does not completely remedy the diffi-
culty. Consider a pump whose cylinders are 10 in. and 16 in. in diame-
ter. The low pressure cylinder area will then be 2.56 times that of the
high pressure. The stroke being the same the volumes will be in the
same ratio. A pair of such pumps, if duplex, will just about meet the
requirements laid down above. On domestic service one alone would
-be run. On fire service both would be run and at double the speed on


The Technic.
domestic service. Ordinarily in these pumps, on Are service no work is
done in the high pressure cylinder as no separate exhaust is provided for
it, so the amount of steam used per stroke on Are service will be 2.56
times that used on domestic service, and as there are four times as many
strokes the steam required for fire service will be ten times that required
for domestic service, approximately. Of course some diminution of
pressure will generally be allowable, but it is safe to say that the fire
service will require eight times as much steam as the domestic service.
As this demand is one that must be met in a very short time, or the
effectiveness of the fire service will be seriously impaired, some special
device appears to be necessary, in the way of a blower to produce a sud-
den increase of combustion. While a very high chimney may serve the
purpose to some extent, there is at hand a much more effective means of
accomplishing the desired result, viz., the exhaust steam. While ordin-
ary fuel consumption varies from 10 to 20 lbs. per square foot of grate, a
combustion of 120 lbs. may be produced by a steam blast. After using
steam for heating the feed water and the pump room there is still enough
of the exhaust remaining for a good steam blast, for less than one-fifth
will be required tor the feed water and not more than the same amount
for heating any ordinary pump room; the rest would ordinarily go to
waste. By utilizing the exhaust steam for a blast, by means of nozzles at
the base of the stack, as in a locomotive, a smaller chimney and a smaller
boiler plant will be sufficient, thus involving less initial cost, and while
it may be argued that a steam blast is of low efficiency and detrimental
to the life of the chimney, it seems to us that where it would be used so
seldom, and where it would then use only steam that must otherwise be
wasted, it could not be anything but a very effective and valuable addi-
tion to the plant, and the smaller chimney needed with it could be
replaced at small expense when it should become necessary. It is also
to be remembered that a good supply of water at the beginning of a fire
may be infinitely more valuable than the same supply twenty minutes
later, and any device that will assist in insuring such a supply should
not be overlooked.
A very interesting point to be considered in direct pressure engines
is the economical length of stroke. The stroke should be such that
the losses due to condensation in the cylinder shall be reduced as
much as possible. This requires that the ratio of volume to surface
shall be a maximum. Then, also, the time that the steam occupies the
cylinder is another element to be considered. While in a single cylinder
engine it is not difficult to determine the best length of stroke to adopt,


83
in a duplex compound pump, where both pistons act along the same,
piston rod, it becomes quite a complicated problem. Even in this case
if the ratio of surface to volume and the time of occupancy of the
cylinder by the steam were the only considerations, the solution of the
problem would not involve very serious difficulties; but we have to
consider the variable clearance, the variable service required of the
pumps, and the relative disadvantages of condensation in each of the
two cylinders. In an ordinary system of the sort considered, in a small
town, as already pointed out, the domestic service will probably require
less than one-half the capacity of the pump, and yet the pump must be
of the greater capacity for the sake of a few hours' use in a month for
Are service, hence a high piston speed cannot be maintained during the
greater proportion of the time. So in determining the economical length
of stroke, we must consider the pump as working at its low piston
speed, taking care to introduce no conditions that will be incompatible
with the performance of the required fire service, In view of the fact
that the sooner the steam can be made to do its work and be exhausted,
the less will be the condensation, we are inclined to favor short strokes.
The condition of minimum surface for maximum volume in a single
cylinder makes the length of stroke equal to the diameter of the piston
so that we would certainly not make the stroke longer than the diameter
of the low pressure cylinder, and the economical length according with
this condition alone would be somewhere intermediate between the
diameters of the two cylinders, but condensation in the high pressure
cylinder will be more detrimental than in the low because in the for-
mer the water so produced must be carried on through the engine
clogging the work in the low pressure cylinder, while in the latter it is
immediately exhausted without further detriment; so we will find it
advantageous to favor the high pressure cylinder as much as possible
and make the stroke equal to the diameter of that cylinder. If the
engine works at very slow speeds on domestic service, it may be desira-
ble to still further shorten the stroke, and the only limit that it appears
necessary to impose, is that the number of revolutions on fire service
shall not be too great. It may be urged that the work expended in
overcoming the inertia of the column of water in the mains, would be
an argument against many strokes and in favor of few, but in a duplex
pump only the water in the cylinder comes to rest during the change of
stroke, and the more frequent the stroke the less the fluctuation of pres-
sure in the mains and the less energy used up in accelerating the water
column, so that a short stroke will be likely to increase the duty of a


The Technic.
duplex compound pump up to a certain limit. Just what this limit will
be will depend upon the particular case in hand. While at first sight
it may appear that the shortening of the stroke will have a detrimental
effect by increasing the clearance, yet this is of comparatively small
consequence, as the steam occupying the clearance space in the high
pressure cylinder is passed over to the low pressure and does work there,
so that all that is really wasted, is that in the clearance spaces of the low
pressure cylinder, and this, from its highly expanded.condition, will not
amount to much. Therefore it seems to us that for such service as that
here considered a short stroke is to" be looked upon with favor.
Automatic Cut-Offs and Throttling Governors.
The Lansing Engine in the Mechanical Laboratory is fitted with an
automatic shaft governor and also with a throttling governor. The
class in Steam Engineering in their experimental work tested this
engine to determine the relative value of the two forms of governors.
The boiler used was small and would furnish steam for only a small
amount of power, and the results obtained and presented are for com-
paratively low pressures. It was expected that for this low pressure the
throttling governor would show the least steam consumption per I. H.
P., but the reverse proved to be the case. The following are the results
obtained:

CONSTEUCTION PROFILE.
A very convenient form oi'
construction profile for the
field may be made by taking
100 feet vertical height of
plate A »r 150 feet vertical
height of plate B, of continu-
ous profile paper, and folding
the paper back and forth alter-
nately every thirty stations.
This can be bound in an old
book cover or in heavy card-
board. The two pages facing
give sixty stations on which
to put a section. All the gen-
eral information needed in the
field, such as allignment, ver-
cal curves, bench marks, ref-
erence points, road and farm
crossings, names of property
owners, land lines, width of
right of way, daily force ac-
count, etc. etc., may be put in
this small space, and it also
makes an excellent pocket
memoranda. The accompany-
ing cut is taken from such a
profile and shows, on a small
scale, how this may be done.
The hatching shows the work
done in different months and
should be in different colors
on the profile, as that shows
better than hatching and is
more easily made.

Hints and Experiences.
In pile driving, it is held by many experienced engineers, both on
the Atlantic Coast and on the Mississippi, that for ordinary ground the
pile should not be sharpened. They say that the pile if sharpened rarely
has its point in the neutral axis, and that the blows of the hammer are
not applied so that the action line of the force passes through the point,
and hence a couple is introduced tending to strain and weaken the tim-
ber. If on the other hand the pile is left blunt, the consolidated earth
forms a point which, changing with each blow, keeps itself continually
in the line of force and hence the straining couple is not introduced. In
ordinary practice, however, the pile is tapered somewhat at the lower
end, although not sharpened to a point.
***
In filling in earth or other material behind a retaining wall of any
sort, the filling should always begin at the wall and be continued away
from it. The earth beneath the surface is thus consolidated aioay from
the wall, while if the embankment is carried out towards the wall the
consolidation takes place against the wall and tends to throw it over,
unless the earth on the opposite side is equally consolidated by some
other means. The importance of this was fully demonstrated at the
Rondout Creek-Bridge on the West Shore Railroad, where an expensive
abutment was only saved from destruction after improper filling, by
driving piles in front of it, and thus consolidating the earth there to
resist the pressure from behind. The same effect has frequently been
noticed on a small scale in my own experience, and more than once a
consideration of this matter beforehand has saved no inconsiderable
inconvenience and expense.
In the construction of the water-works at Greenville, Michigan, dur-
ing the summer of 1888, it was necessary to lay a line of 12 inch pipe
across Flat River, some 200 feet, in water about four feet deep. By
manipulating dams above and below the point we were able to get the
water down to about two feet in depth. Eighteen lengths of twelve
inch pipe were laid in place in the water and then raised by means of
jack-screws placed on horses above, from which the pipe was sus-
pended, until the joints were out of water. The pipe was then set to the
proper curve and caulked with lead in the usual manner, after which it
was lowered by means of the screws worked simultaneously, until parts
of it bore on the bottom. The Steam Fire Engine was then brought to


87
the crossing and two lines of hose taken out with 1% inch nozzles, streams
from which at a pressure of about 140 lbs. at the engine were played
upon the bottom underneath the pipe and the earth was scoured away
until the pipe came to a bearing for its entire length. The pipe was
then released from the screws and the jets were worked along the pipe
until it was buried its full depth in the river bottom, which consisted of
sand and gravel The jets worked better in the gravel than in the sand.
This method of laying the pipe was found to be much more economical
than by means of a coffer dam, and was in every way successful. The
pipe was tested, before being covered, at a pressure of 160 lbs. per square
inch, and but one joint was found to leak at all, and this leak was imme-
diately stopped by a few strokes of the caulking iron. It appeared, hew-
ever, that in sinking the pipe further, a nozzle or pipe that was bent to a
curve would be preferable to a straight one. In some places the pipe
was sunk to a depth of eighteen inches.
From the river to the Pump House the line extended about 450 feet
across a flat where quicksand was encountered at a depth of less than
two feet. The pipe was laid at the top of the quicksand in a line parallel
to grade as nearly as possible and the entire length caulked. It was
then lowered to grade very successfully by putting a man on each side
of each length and having them dig cn both sides of the pipe along the
entire line at the same time. In this way we succeeded in lowering the
pipe in some places as much as four feet, and none of the joints were
sprung so as to leak in an open ditch under 160 lbs. pressure. Three
hundred feet of 16 inch suction was laid in the same way.
**#
On these works it was not infrequently the case that a joint had to
be run when half or two-thirds of it was under w ater. In such cases
we used the ordinary clay-rolls making two openings at the top. We
next poured in a small quantity of oil, kerosene will do, but a thicker oil
is better, and then slowly poured in the lead at one of the holes. The
water would be forced out, the layer of oil apparently keeping it away
from the lead and as perfect a run would be obtained as in a thoroughly
dry joint. This method was used on all sizes from 16 inch to 6 inch and
was found uniformly successful, there being neither explosion nor spat-
tering.
***
Statistics collected on these works showed that it actually cost less
to buy and put in a 6 inch pipe to reach one block with a hydrant at the
end of it, than it would to buy 2% inch hose to reach the same block with
a nozzle at the end of it. G. S. Williams, '89.


The Technic.
Test of Engines and Boilees of Stb. "Thos. W. Palmer."
This test was made under very unfavorable conditions, and the
results must not be taken as a criterion of the work done by engine and
boiler makers on the lakes. The boat was on her second regular trip
and consequently the engine had not had time to get into good working
condition. The high pressure valve leaked so badly that it has since
been replaced by one of different construction. It was a piston valve,
steam-packed—and they use now one with ordinary ring packing. Xo
attempt was made to alter the ordinary conditions under which the boat
was to run. The coul was Ohio steamboat coal, containing a good deal
of slack, and caked quite badly on the grates. The whole plant was run
at a rate considerably below its normal working capacity.
The test began at 9:00 a. M.,on June 5th, six hours out from Chicago,
and stopped at 9:00 p. m. of the same day. The boat was loaded to 15 ft.
mean draft with 93,000 bushels of corn for Buffalo. Observations were
taken every hour, as follows:
Indicator cards from engine; vacuum; steam pressure and tempera-
ture; revolutions; temperature in the exhaust pipes from each cylinder;
temperatures of feed, injection and hot-well; temperatures in chimney, in
engine room and in lire room; barometric pressure; miles run by taff-
rail log, and by landmarks on the chart; coal burned and ashes drawn;
draught of chimney, and water used in each boiler separately.
Calorimeter tests were made from time to time, and tests of the two
metres used to measure the water.
Two indicators were used on each cylinder, six in all. Five of them
being Thompson's and one a Tabor. These were cleaned and oiled each
time a card was taken. An accident to an indicator at the beginning of
the test prevented a complete series of cards being taken from the air
pump. Two operators were employed at the same time in taking the
cards, one at the top of the cylinders, the other at the bottom. The ther-
mometers used were finely graduated, and all instruments were stand-
ardized. The calorimeter tests were made with a copper tank, covered
with hair felt and wood lagging and a proper correction made for its
thermal value. The scales weighed to one hundredth of a pound.
The water meters were kindly loaned by the Union Water Metre Co.
of Worcester, Mass. They were tested from time to time to find the
actual weight of water registered.
The test was begun and ended with the water in the boilers at the
same level. The fires at the beginning and end were well sliced, clean

Since the test was made and the new valve fitted, a large reduction in
the consumption of fuel has been noted. It is believed that a consider-
able increase in economy and efficiency may be looked for in another
test which it is expected to make during the summer.

A Curve Problem.
The problem here solved is one that came up in the practice of the
writer, and the frequency of its occurrence in field work is thought to
justify its presentation here. While the formulae which are deduced may
at first sight appear too intricate for use in the field, still, when the
proper substitutions are made the results come quite readily, and the
method given is far preferable to the cut and try process which must
otherwise be resorted to.
The problem is as follows: Given the already located lines NREM
OP and NRGHQ (which includes the data concerning the curves
EMO and RG with centres at B and C, together with the tangent dis-
tance RE) to find the length and points of tangency of a curve (MH)
of given degree which shall form a Y with the line already located.
The notation used is similar to that given in Searle's "Field Engineer-
ing."
Let the radii of the curves with centres at A, B and C be respect-
ively r„r„ and r„ and their intersection angles \, A2, and A3, their degrees

of curvature being represented by D„ D2, and D3; let RE=c. Then will
c, r2, r3, A2, A3, and r^ be given by the requirements of the problem, to rind
A, and the angle EBM, which latter angle will locate the position of M,
the P. C. of the desired curve with centre at A.

EK c — r3 tan % A3
BK = V EB2 + EK2 = Vr.,2 + (c — r3 tan % A,)*.
It will be seen that the angle BKL = 180c — A3— EKB, and from
the triangle BKL we have
BL = BK sin BKL = BK sin (180°— A3— EKB) = BK sin (A,+ EKB)
Through B draw BV parallel to LH, forming the right angled tri-
angle AVB with AV= ^— BL.
From this triangle we have
VA ^-BL
sin VBA = = . Find VBA.

Then, since the angle EBV = 90°— 4„we have the following value:
EBM = EBV + VBA = 90°—A3 +VBA.1 Find EBM.
angle EBM
Then, EM = .

In the triangle AVB angle VAB = \ = 90°—VBA. Find \.

These values of EM and MH are sufficient to make the desired loca-
tion on the ground. A value of GH might also have been given for a
check, but it has seemed to the writer unnecessary.
If the circumstances are such th.it the curve A becomes tangent to
the curve C, the line GH of course disappears, and the following special
values obtain:
Let y% (AB + BC + CA) = s, and by application of the ordinary
formulae of plane trigonometry having given three sides of an oblique
angled triangle, we have
/(&lt;* — ri — r,) (s — r, —r2)
A, = 2 arc tan /_ 1 . v 1 _

angle EBM = 2 arc tan /^s~Tl~T^ (s~v c'+ (r'+ r3-^ — arc tan ——
j/ s(s — r, — rs) r2+r,
These latter formulae can be quite expeditiously solved by means of
logarithms.
In case the tangent c also disappears the formulae last given will
effect the solution if c be made zero in both equations.

Slip of Pumps.
From a series of tests made by Mr. E. B. Perry in the engineering
laboratory to determine the relative efficiencies of Injectors and Pumps-
as boiler feeders, we have been able to obtain the following data regard-
ing the slip of a Gordon Duplex Steam Pump having 6 in. steam cylin-
ders and 4 in. water cylinders. These experiments were carried on with
the same apparatus as described in the paper on Injector Tests on page
56. Observations as to the length of stroke and number of revolutions
were taken every five minutes, and each test extended over thirty min-
utes.

From this it appears that the slip is not alone dependent upon the
time, for if that were the case we should get as much slip in the
second case as in the first, as the tests were of equal duration. Hence
the ordinary method of determining the slip of a pump by taking the
pressure off from one side of the piston and measuring the leakage past
it, is faulty, because the slip varies somewhat with the speed. But the
slip evidently does not vary as the first power of the speed, for the speed in
the first case is 2.48 times that in the second, while the slip is only 1.92
times as great. This might be expected because whenever the piston
changes direction the particles of water which are leaking past it are
moving in a direction in opposition to that in which leakage tends to
take place on the new stroke. We may therefore reason that the shorter
the stroke the less the leakage, and that when the piston is at rest the
leakage is a minimum, being only that due to the time and pressure, and
we have another argument in favor of short strokes in pnnips.
The leakage past the piston must take place around the circumfer-
ence in the form of an infinitesimally thick ring, so that it will vary very
nearly as the circumference, or as the diameter. The volume swept
through varies as the area of the piston or as the square of the diame-
. ter. Therefore, the more rapid the speed the less the percentage of leak-
age will be, although the absolute leakage will be greater, so we may
expect pumps to give a higher duty at high speed than at low speed; and
as the leakage past the piston varies as the diameter, while the volume
swept through varies as the square of the diameter, it follows that the
larger the piston the less will be the percentage of slip.
So far we have not considered the leakage through the suction and
•delivery valves, but it seems to us that with rubber valves this should
■be far less important than the leakage past the piston, but if increasing


The Technic.
the number of strokes has any effect here, it will be to increase the slip,
because evidently most of the leakage past the valve will occur when it
is just coming to its seat.
It is not uncommon to make an allowance of from 3 % to 5 % for
leakage, but in view of of the results of these tests this seems to be
much larger than is necessary.
Of course these two tests are too small a basis upon which to con-
struct a very elaborate theory of slip, and the deduction of any formula
from them would be absurd, but we may set them down as attesting to
the truth of the theoretical deductions that the slip will be greater in
amount at high speed than at low, that it will be less with many strokes
than with few, and that it is dependent upon other elements than time.
In a test of the High Duty Pumping Engines at Washington, D. C,
by engineer G. W. Baird, U. S. N., described in the first number of the
Journal of the American Society of Naval Engineers, the method of
determining the slip was "by stopping one engine and putting the nor-
mal pressure of the high service mains upon the discharge valves
and one side of the plunger" and piping away the leakage. Mr.
Baird then assumed that the slip would vary as the square root
of the head according to the formula v— \/2gh. He, however, failed, ap-
parently, to take into consideration the force acting on the suction side
of the piston, which certainly must have as much effect as an equiva-
lent head on the pressure side. But leaving out this error, the experi-
ments above show the inaccuracy of such a process of determining slip.
One would expect that more leakage must occur under the effects of a
series of impacts than under steady pressure, and the experiments bear
us out in this. The water apparently resists instantly taking up the
motion of the piston, and it tends to go in all directions as the piston is
forced into it. The more rapid the motion of the piston the greater the
resistance to the change of direction of motion in each end of the cyl-
inder, and hence the greater the slip, for it is evident that the direction
of motion of the water in the cylinder must be changed at every stroke.
We might therefore expect that the leakage would be the greatest at the
beginning of the stroke, but this is apparently modified by interferences
already referred to. Further experiments on this subject will be awaited
with interest and few fields of original investigation offer more inter-
esting developments. Equipped as the University is for such work, it
will not be long before some of our students will be able to give to the
profession some really definite information on this subject.
G. S. Williams, '89.


The Long Tape.
Some of our western surveyors have recently introduced the long
tape with marked success. On level ground it is easily seen that in the
case of a tape five chains long the liability of error is only one-fifth as
great as with a chain, the pin only having to be stuck once in the former
to five times in the latter. In rough hill work the tape is not levelled,
but the angle of elevation or depression of the tape is taken and the true
distance found from a traverse table. When the tape passes over a ridge
the angles at the ridge and the distance from the end of the tape are
taken. By this means the distance ib obtained much more quickly and
accurately than by ordinary chaining. In measuring with the chain
care must be taken to keep it level, and to do this it is often necessary
to use only a part of the chain, which makes not only slow work but
greater chances for errors that are not compensating but tend always to
increase the distance. With the long tape the use of fractional chains is
done away with except in the closing measurement, and the chances of
error materially decreased. The survey of a ranch containing 327 acres
in very rough country closed with an' error of five links in latitude and
one link in departure, being surveyed with a five chain tape. In the sur-
vey of a tract of land containing about 8,700 acres the traverse was
about 20 miles long. About three miles of this was over very rough
ground, where it was sometimes necessary to take three angles of eleva-
tion in the length of the tape. The closing error in latitude was four
links and in departure one link. F. A. Steiger, '91.
Heating by Exhaust Steam.
The economy of using exhaust steam for heating shops and factories-
seems to be very little appreciated, and it is not at all infrequently that
we see a direct steam heating apparatus in use when the exhaust steam
from the engine would heat three or four such buildings.
If we have a 10 x 12 engine making 250 revolutions using steam at
85 lbs. gage pressure, it gives about 25 H. P. If it is an automatic cut-
off engine it will use about 30 lbs. of steam per H. P. or 750 lbs. per hour.
Expanding four times, the steam at exhaust will be at 10 lbs. gage
pressure, and will contain 1,155 heat units per pound, of which 975
H. U. are available for heating, and the total available heat in exhaust
steam per hour is 731,250 H. U. This, under ordinary conditions, will
heat a shop two stories high and 40 x 120 ft., or as large a shop as that


The Technic.
of which the engine would run the machinery. However, some may
wish to use the exhaust steam for heating the feed water, but in that
case, with a good heater less than one-fifth of the exhaust is needed, and
"besides, by conveying the drip from the heating coils to a hot well the
best feed water will be obtained at a high temperature. If one objects
to the back pressure on the piston of the engine, let the feed pump or
injector be connected to the end of the heating coils when the back
pressure can be reduced to zero, but at the University of Michigan there
are several exhaust heating coils of 1J£ in. pipe over 100 ft. long that do
not raise the back pressure more than one pound. It has also been sug-
gested that the condenser, if the engine be a condensing one, might be
connected to the end of the heating coils. The vaccuum at the back of
the piston would then be less, by the amount of friction and resistance
in the coils, than if the condenser were closely connected, and the tem-
perature in the coils would be that due to the pressure, so that the coils
would need to have more surface, and on that account the arrangement
might not be as economical as to do away with the condenser altogether
when the building has to be heated. Few condensers actually increase
the power more than 25 %, counting in the cost of running them, while
if the same space is to be heated by a direct steam return system it will
require the burning of nearly as much coal as is needed to run the
engine, or at least 90 % additional. Hence it appears to be more econ-
omical to do away with the condenser in cold weather. "When one
reflects that in many shops the exhaust steam is totally wasted he can
not wonder that manufacturers continue to cut down the wages of their
employees more and more as the cost of fuel increases, but the economy
of employing cheap men is and must always remain very doubtful, and
there are few engine plants to-day, in charge of ordinary engineers, that
would not be rendered from 10 % to 50 % more productive by the em-
ployment of a first-class man.
The above is but one case in the many where the efficiency of most
plants could be increased. G. S. Williams, '89.
The Mechanical Labokatoky.
The basement of the main building of the Engineering Laboratory,
which has been vacant since built, will this summer be fitted up for
experimental work in engineering. Next year engineering students will
have excellent facilities for acquiring a practical knowledge of many
things which they have been in the past obliged to take for granted.


97
The following brief description of the Mechanical Laboratory work
will be of interest to all.
The laboratory contains a 10x30 inch Keynolds Corliss Engine, in
part donated by the late Edward P. Allis, of Milwaukee, and an 8x12
Lansing Automatic Engine, buij(t in the laboratory shops from castings
donated by the Lansing Iron and Engine Works. A 40 H. P. boiler, to
be put in during the summer, will, together with a Wheeler surface
condenser, donated by Mr. F. N. Wheeler, of New York, give as complete
a steam plant for experimental work as is possessed by any engineering
school in the country. One pair each of Thompson, Crosby, and Tabor
indicators, a large variety of special thermometers, steam gauges, the
different forms of calorimeters, two Worthington water meters, plat-
form scales and weighing tanks, one Worthington amd one Gordon
duplex pump, one Blake pump, one Aquapult pump, Monitor, Little
Giant, Pemberthy, and Metropolitan injectors, a Westinghouse air-
brake, complete,— most of which have been donated to the University,
—comprise the additional apparatus for steam engineering work.
Three of Green's best thermometers, one of Shaw's U. S. standard
mercury test gauges, a 40-foot mercury column, and U. S. standard
weights, will afford means for standardizing instruments.
Apparatus for testing lubricants, for measuring the transmission of
power by belting, the frictions of shafting, engines, and machines, several
forms of dynamometers, water wheels, hydraulic and pneumatic appa-
ratus, are also to be provided.
The 1,500,000 Knowles and 2,000,000 Gordon pumps at the City
Water Works have been fitted up with all the necessary connections for
convenience in making tests; and free access is had to the Buckeye, Ball,
Kimble, and Hamilton Corliss? engines in and near the city. Opportu-
nities are also afforded to make tests on steam machinery in neighboring
cities, and on some of the larger steamers plying on the Great Lakes.
It was expected that a testing machine for determining the strength
of materials would also be one of the features of our laboratory, a fine
place being provided for the same; but for the present, unless some of
our engineering alumni should favor the University with the necessary
funds, it must be further postponed. This is greatly to be regretted, as
the need for a testing machine is very great.
The work of an experimental character that has been done in the
past will be shown by the following partial list of graduating theses:

Marine Engineering.
It will be of interest to many of our readers to know that a course
in Marine Engineering is now offered in the University. The detail by
the Navy Department of Assistant Engineer Leo D. Miner, U. S. Navy,
enables the University to offer special work in a line that must meet the
approval of a large class of young men on and about our Great Lakes.
There is a demand among our ship-building concerns for young men
trained in marine work, of which young engineers should not be slow to
avail themselves.
When it is considered that a larger tonnage of new vessels is built
at our lake ship-building establishments than on the Atlantic, Gulf and
Pacific coasts combined, and that Ann Arbor is situated almost in the
centre of the Great Lake System, affording easy access to the different
yards, the advantages of such a course of study at this University will
be apparent.
The instruction in this branch comprises the study of marine
engines and propelling instruments, the hydraulics of ship-building,
buoyancy, metacenter, stability and trim, weight and centre of gravity,
waves and rolling, structure, strength, speed and resistance, propulsion
by sails and steam engines, laying down and taking off, and frequent
visits of inspection to neighboring ship-yards.

A CARD.
On behalf of the Engineering Department of the University of
Michigan, The Technic takes pleasure in extending this evidence of
the appreciation and gratitude felt by our students and professors, to
all those business firms throughout the country who have so liberally
bestowed upon us machinery and other apparatus. It is by means of this
alone that the student is able to undertake and carry out much of the
original investigation which forms so important a part of our senior
work. The thanks of the Department are especially extended to the
Lansing Iron and Engine Works, the American Steam Gauge Co., the
Crosby Steam Gauge and Valve Co., the Ashcroft Manufacturing Co.,
the Deane Steam Pump Co., the Geo. F. Blake Manufacturing Co., the
Knowles Steam Pump Co., the Worthington Steam Pump Co., the Gordon
Steam Pump Co., and the Valley Machine Co., for valuable presents in
the lines of steam engineering; and we are also indebted to several
injector manufacturers for donations of samples of their goods, besides
to others too numerous to be mentioned here. Many of the experiments
recorded in these pages could have been performed only by the aid of
these concerns, and their friendship will not soon be forgotten. The
University is pleased to receive and afford a safe repository for any and
all gifts that bear upon the subject of Engineering in any of its
branches, and with our increased facilities for tests of all kinds, we offer
especial advantages to those wishing information regarding the relative
merits of different forms of apparatus and machinery.
CHARLES ALFRED MARSHALL.
The Engineering Society of the University of Michigan has just
been called upon for the first time to mourn the loss of a graduate
member.
Charles Alfred Marshall was born at Camden, jST. J., February 3,
1855, and died a victim of the Johnstown disaster May 31, 1889. His
early life was spent in Wilmington, Del. In 1872 he entered the Univer-
sity of Michigan, taking the regular course in civil engineering, and
graduated as a member of the class of '76. As a student he was among
the best in his class, and was regarded by the faculty as one of the most
promising young men who had ever left the University.
Soon after graduating he entered the drafting oflice of the Edge
Moor Iron Co., at Wilmington, Del., and in 187S) was placed in charge of
the oflice as chief draftsman and designer. Leaving this position in 1880


The Technic.
he was for a few months in the office of C. Shaler Smith, C. E., being
engaged in work on the Illinois and St. Louis Bridge. He- was then
given charge of drawings and inspection of five spans of the Sabula
Bridge over the Mississippi River for the Chicago, Milwaukee and St.
Paul Railway Company. When this work was finished, in 1881, he
became Chief Engineer of the Passaic Rolling Mill Co., Paterson, N. J.
As the work of this position was not to his taste he resigned and took
the position of Assistant Engineer in the employ of the Cambria Iron
Company. While there he designed and had charge of the construction
of a number of iron and steel bridges as well as numerous roofs, ware-
houses and mill extensions. In 1883 he became "Engineer of Tests" of
the same company, which position he retained until his death. Having
charge of the Laboratory of Physical Tests, his work included the
study of steel, tests of steel, oil and building materials. At the same
time he was engaged in the building of bridges, and making reports on
water supply and its various problems. He was a member of the Amer-
ican Society of Civil Engineers, and of the American Institute of Min-
ing Engineers.
Although cut off in almost the spring time of life, Charles A. Mar-
shall had, by his merit and untiring energy, already attained prominence
among the engineers of the country, and the prospects for his future
seemed very brilliant. He had not long been a member of the Engin-
eering Society, but during his short connection with it he had gained
the respect and sincere regard of the members. To him the Society is
indebted for many favors, not the least of these being the paper furnished
for publication which appears in this issue, and which is thought to be
the last production of his pen.
The following resolutions were adopted by the Society at its regular
meeting June 14th, 1889:
Whereas, By the death of Mr. Charles A. Marshall, class of '76, the
Engineering Society of the University of Michigan has lost one of its
most highly respected and esteemed graduate members, and the profes-
sion at large one of its most promising and capable engineers;
Resolved, That this Society extend to his family and relatives its
heartfelt sympathy in the loss which they have been called upon to sus-
tain, and
Resolved, That this Society publish a biographical sketch in its
annual, " The Technic," and send copies of the same, together with these
resolutions, to his family.

EDITORIALS.
The board of editors has endeavored to follow the example so ably
set by The Technic Board of 1888, and has attempted but few changes
in the general character of the publication. We have as a frontispiece
a portrait of Professor Mortimer E. Cooley, followed by a sketch of his
life. The great interest that Prof. Cooley takes in our Society is too
well known to need farther comment, and it affords us great pleasure
to show, in a small degree, our great appreciation of his good will
towards us. The only changes from the publication of 1888 that we
have attempted are the papers from our graduate members and the
miscellaneous notes. We wish to open the pages of The Technic to
all our members, honorary, graduate and associate, as well as active;
and, as a beginning, have published papers by Charles A. Marshall, '76,
Fred. J. Bulkley, '75, and a "note" by I. O. Waiker, '83. It is also our
sad duty to announce the death of Mr. Marshall in the recent Johnstown
disaster. We have attempted to obtain for publication as much as pos-
sible concerning his life, in the short time allowed us, but could succeed
in obtaining only an incomplete sketch. We have also published a short
account of the courses of study pursued here by engineering students.
Trusting that our publication will meet your approbation and receive
a kindly welcome, we present for your consideration, in behalf of.the
Engineering Society of the University of Michigan, The Technic
of 1889.
The closing words of the address of George E. Steele, President
of the Michigan Engineering Society, delivered at its tenth annual con-
vention, are worthy of consideration, and a more satisfactory endorse-
ment of the policy and objects of The Technic could not be desired.
For many years the students of the University of Michigan have felt
that the processes and experiments gone through with in our daily work,
and the careful thesis investigations of our graduates, deserve a more
prominent place than is afforded upon the shelves of the University
library. President Steele's suggestion that these should be regularly
published and given to the profession, must meet the approval of all.


The Technic.
In almost every issue of the leading engineering journals we see
instances of persons presenting to the public as new and original, meth-
ods and processes that have been taught here for years. The Engineering
Society, with these facts in view, last year so altered the character of
its publication that it should be henceforth not a mere journal of soci-
ety proceedings, but rather a Record of the work of the Engineering
Department. This change could not be immediately brought about in
all its details, and however much it was desired by last year's board of
editors to introduce a department of miscellaneous notes, which should
consist especially of the results of our experiments here and our expe-
riences elsewhere, it was not until this ye:ir that it was possible to ac-
complish that result. We now, however, present to our reader.-; not only
a portion of The Technic especially devoted to the work of our stu-
dents, but also a part of the thesis work in the papers by Messrs,
Whitman, Crocker and Perry, and in Mr. Walker's paper the results
of some of his experiences as division engineer, while Mr. Lamont's pa-
per gives the practice of the M. C. It. It. car shops as observed by him
during his engagement there as draughtsman. The material in the
notes is either abstracts of theses, the results of experiments in our
laboratories, or the experiences of our students in their work else-
where.
In the advertising department The Technic has endeavored, as
heretofore, to present only the best, and only those which it will be of
interest to engineers to know, for we believe that the educational value
of the advertising pages of a magazine is not to be overlooked. On this
principle we have never yet experienced any difficulty in getting all the
advertisements we desired, and we trust that the same policy will be
maintained in the future. As a whole or in parts, we feel that we can
consign The Technic to our readers with reasonable assurance of a
friendly welcome.
Not the least among the signs which have marked the progress of
our Society during the past year, is the large addition made to the
library, for which we are indebted to the generosity of both our active
and graduate members. We would make especial mention of the large
and very valuable donation of books and periodicals made by Capt. E.
L. Corthell, of Chicago, who we are pleased to say is an honorary
member of our Society. We also take this opportunity of publicly


103
acknowledging the presentation to our Society of a number of standard
engineering works by Mr. J. Rice Miner, class of 'DO, and a number of
photographic views by Mr. Fred. G. Bulkley, class of '75, State Geologist
of Colorado. Through the kindness of these and others of our members
and friends, the size of the library has bei'n more than doubled within
the past year, and judging from the interest expressed in our work by
graduates and friends we think that its growth in the future will be
quite as rapid. The Society has this year tried the experiment of estab-
lishing a reading-room, and so much interest has been taken in it by the
members that its continuance is assured. A number of engineering
papers have been subscribed for by the Society, and for others we are
indebted to the courtesy of members and friends. Owing to the expense
of the publication of The Technic, there is but a limited amount of
money that can be used for the purpose of the reading-room, and the
members would be very happy to receive any donations of papers or
books that the Alumni or friends of the Society may see fit to make.
One prominent feature of the progress of our Society in the past
year, has been the change in the constitution whereby two new classes
of membership have been created, namely, "Graduate Membership," to
which class all graduates of the University, who while in college
pursued engineering studies, are eligible; and "Associate Membership,"
to which class all non-graduates who are now engaged in engineering
work or who have formerly been members of the Society, are eligible.
For some time it had been thought advisable to establish a closer
connection between the Alumni of the Engineering Department and the
Engineering Society, but until the past year no definite steps had been
taken in that direction. Now, however, in response to a circular letter
issued by the Society, we are pleased to say that a large number of our
graduates and former students have availed themselves of the opportu-
nities for membership, and that we now have upon our books some of
the most prominent and highly respected names in the profession. To
them we are much indebted for the interest taken in our work, and also
for many favors in the way of financial aid, and donations of papers
and photographs, received at their hands. It is hoped that we may have
the opportunity, in the near future, of reciprocating some of their favors
by making The Technic largely a medium for the publication of papers
by the Alumni, and also for the dissemination of news concerning the
work in which they are engaged. We trust that, as our object is a


The Technic.
worthy one, we may hear from still others of our former students who
have not yet responded to our invitation to become members, and that
we may secure their cooperation in the work which we are endeavoring
to do as a Society.
The Technic is indebted to the following publications for the cour-

We would call especial attention to the Protractor Triangle, invent-
ed by Mr. C. E. DePuy, of Jackson, Michigan, one of our members, and
described by him on page 78. From our own experience we think it will
be a very valuable addition to the instruments in ordinary use in the
draughting room.
Among the many opportunities for instruction of various kinds
which the University of Michigan offers to her students, none can be
found more enjoyable or more instructive than the visits of inspection
to manufacturing establishments in Detroit, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and
elsewhere. The first trip taken the past year was to Detroit and Wyan-
dotte, to witness the launching of the steamship "Thomas W. Palmer,"
the work of whose engines on the trial trip forms the Thesis of two of our
graduates, extracts from which may be found in these pages. To those
who were able to participate in the enjoyment of that day, it will ever
remain as one of the brightest memories of the four most pleasant years
of their lives, thanks to the kindness of Mr. William Livingstone, of
the Percheron Steam Navigation Company.
The trip proper was taken in April to Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.
About ten days were spent upon it and the leading manufacturing estab-


105
lishments of the two cities and surrounding country were visited. Space
forbids a detailed account of the experience and incidents, but we can-
not pass on without expressing our appreciation of the cordiality with
which we were received everywhere. Although the plan is to alternate
yearly between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, it did not seem to those on
the trip this year that they could pass through the former place without
paying their respects to those who have for several years past extended
to our parties every consideration and accommodation in their power.
Prominent among these is the firm of Carnegie, Phipps &amp; Co., and were
it only to visit their various works, the trip would be well worth taking.
A visit to the Edgar Thompson Works at night is an experience that
once gone through, will remain with one for life. There are places of
great interest among the other branches of this firm's business, as the
Union Iron Mills, the Isabella and Lucy Furnaces and the Homestead
Steel Works, but as a climax to the whole, as a fitting ending to a chap-
ter of wonders the scenes at Edgar Thompson remain indelibly impressed
puon the memory. At Philadelphia, for many of us, probably the most
interesting places visited were the Testing Machine Works of Olsen
and Riehle' and the Machine Shop of Pedrick &amp; Ayer, while the ship-
yards perhaps outrank all other attractions among the students of
Marine Engineering. Whatever other courses may wane in popularity
and usefulness, the trip will ever remain as one of the favorite and most
valuable means of instruction for our engineering students.
The bill introduced in the National House of Representatives by
Representative Breckinridge, of Kentucky, and in the Senate by Senator
Cullom, to establish a National Bureau of Harbors and Water Ways to
consist of Civil and Military Engineers, is one which deserves the atten-
tion and support of all citizens who are interested in national improve-
ments. It is time that the United States, standing in the forefront of
the line of progress in so many respects, should place herself on an equal-
ity with the countries of the Old World in regard to Public Works.
Great Britain, Prance and Prussia, have systems of Public Improvement
finely developed, while we have none whatever. It is high time that
this should be changed, and engineers especially should put their
"shoulders to the wheel" and assist in bringing about the revolution.
Let every College Engineering Society memorialize each of their alumni
in Congress to give the bill favorable consideration, let each State En-
gineering Society memorialize their representatives, and let all American

engineers, wherever they be, extend to the Council of Engineering Socie-
ties of which Mr. L. E. Cooley, of Chicago, is President, their hearty
cooperation, and a most desired result cannot long be deferred. This
movement has the indorsement of such names as James B. Eads, Elmer
L. Corthell, O. Chanute, Don J. Whittemore, and hundreds of others of
the first engineers of the country. Surely, where these men lead none
should hesitate to follow.
In closing this number of the Technic, we are pleased to say that
the members of the Engineering Society are always glad to hear from
their predecessors in the University of Michigan, and to extend to them
a hearty welcome at the Halls of their Alma Mater. The Society meets
regularly every Friday evening during the college year, and visitors are
always received with pleasure. Our membership, Active, Graduate, As-

THE LATEST. THE BEST,
"Notwithstanding that the Crosby In-
dicator is the latest in the history of in-
dicators, it ranks as the best, not oniy in
the United States, but also in Great
Britain, France, Italy, Norway, Sweden,
Denmark, Germany and Russia, and by
the Admiralties of these several countries
has been officially adopted. We may be
pardoned for adding also, that the Crosby
Indicator is the only indicator described,
illustrated and Indorsed by the last edi-
tion of the scholarly'Encyclopedia Bri-
tannica.' "—Practical Electricity.
In a Paper read before the "Institution
of Civil Engineers" of London, March,
1888, on Non-Condensing Steam Engine trials by Mr. P. F.
Willans, occurs the following reference to the Crosby Steam Indi-
cator:
"The Indicator diagrams were taken in all cases by the Crosby
Indicator, and it is not too much to say, that without that Indi-
cator such trials would have been impossible.
"It would be difficult to speak too highly of the working of these beautiful in-
struments, which produce perfectly clear and measurable diagrams at the speed
(400 revs, per mln.) at which the majority of these tests have been made."
Edison Lamp Co., East Newark, N. J., April 24, 1886.
Crosby Steam Gage and Valve Co.:
Gentlemen; I enclose order for a Crosby Indicator; this order is the result of a
series of tests made by me on Indicators made by the three leading manufacturers,
the Crosby being the only one not furnished with a view of being tested. Apart
from the advantages possessed by the Crosby in its piston and drum springs, I think
it takes a card that shows the action of the steam and valves better than the other
Indicators. The card I sent in my last letter I'consider perfect, the piston being
perfectly free, and showing the free curves on the tops of the cards which the least
sticking of the piston in cylinder will destroy. The fact .that the piston is free in the
cylinder tvhen the spring is compressed shows a correct and perfect construct ion.

PROFESSOR WILLIAM H. PETTEE.
BY CHAS. B. GREENE.
William Henry Pettee, the youngest child of Otis and Matilda (Sher-
man) Pettee was born in Newton Upper Falls, Mass., January 13, 1838,
and in that pleasant suburban village, some ten miles from Boston, his
childhood and youth were spent. Both his parents were natives of Fox-
borough, Mass., and he belongs to that good New England stock to which
the west has been so much a debtor. His father, who died in 1853, was a
manufacturer of cotton cloth and of machinery for cotton mills.
In his boyhood he had been considered as rather weak and frail in
body, with a nervous temperament and an inclination to give himself to
books rather than to share in the boisterous sports of youth. He was,
however, wisely restrained from too much study, and during one winter,
he worked regularly in the foundry and machine shop. Such employment
served a good purpose in strengthening his frame and giving his brain a.
needed rest, while the familiarity with tools and machinery thus acquired,
has proved serviceable in the profession which he was later to adopt. At
that time he did not find mechanical pursuits so adapted to his studious
tastes as to lead him to continue long in such employment. Under such
circumstances his school life prior, to his father's death had been limited
to the district school, with the exception of one term at a private academy
in Hollis,ton, Mass.


The Technic.
Having, under judicious care, strengthened as the years passed on,
he shaped his studies for college, attended the Newton Centre High
School, and completed his preparation at private schools in Auburndale
and Newton Centre.
He entered Harvard College in 1857, took high rank in his class
throughout the course, was selected to deliver a Latin oration " De Nostrae
Aetatis Graecia" at the junior exhibition, and graduated with distinction
in 1861, as a Bachelor of Arts. The subject of his Commencement oration
was "How Political Influence can be made effective to Individual Citi-
zens in this Republic." He was elected a member of the Phi Beta Kappa
in his junior year.
There was at that time in Harvard but one general course, the classi-
cal, with a very limited amount of elective work. Mr. Pettee dropped
mathematics in his junior year and pursued chemistry to a considerable
extent as an elective, and also Spanish. In this language he had the
pleasure of reciting for a year and a half to Prof. James Russell Lowell.
In the spring of 1862 he entered the engineering department of the
Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard University, though with no expec-
tation of being able to complete the course. But during the year 1862-3
he remained in the school in the dual capacity of student and assistant
teacher. In the class which thus came under his instruction were E. C.
Pickering, now Director of the Harvard Observatory, and John Trowbridge,
now Professor of Physics at Harvard.
In 1863 he was appointed assistant in chemistry at Harvard, and
taught for two years the required chemical physics to the sophomore class
and had charge of the elective section of juniors in the laboratory.
In August, 1865, he went to Europe where he spent three years, two
years and a half of which time were given to study at the Royal Saxon
Mining Academy at Freiberg. He occupied most of his vacations in visits
to the mining regions of Germany. Several months were also given to
Paris and England.
In the fall of 1868 he returned to Cambridge as a teacher in the depart-
ment known as the School of Mining and Practical Geology, then estab-
lished under the direction of Prof. Josiah D. Whitney. The following
year lie was appointed Instructor in Mining, whieh title was changed two
years later to that oi Assistant Professor of Mining.
The summer vacation of 1869 was devoted by Prof. Pettee to a geolo-
gical and topographical survey of the South Park in Colorado, and the
region adjacent, a district which at that time had not been covered by the


3
TJ. S. Surveys. This survey was carried on under the auspices of the
School of Mining and was in the immediate charge of Prof. Whitney.
For the college year 1870-71, Prof. Pettee had a leave of absence to
enable him to assist Prof. Whitney on the California State Geological Sur-
vey. His fourteen months in California were occupied for the most part in
the study of the auriferous gravels and of problems connected with the
determination of altitudes by means of the barometer. Some of the re-
sults of the studies appeared in 1874 under the title Contributions to Bar-
ometric Hypsometry, to which a supplementary chapter was added in 1878.
On returning to Cambridge in the fall of 1871 as Assistant Professor of
Mining, Prof. Pettee assumed, in addition to other duties, the charge of
an elective section of undergraduates in Physical Geography, Geology and
Meteorology, which he kept for four years. Near the latter part of this
period the conditions of the gift under which the School of Mining had
been established were altered, and the funds were devoted to the support
of a professorship of Geology alone. Without change of title, however,
Prof. Pettee remained at Harvard during the year 1874-5, giving instruc-
tion to the freshman class in algebra and geometry.
Instruction in some branches of Mining Engineering had been given
at the University of Michigan several years prior to 1875, more particu-
larly in Assaying and Metallurgy, and the degree of Mining Engineer had
been conferred upon a few students in the years 1868 to 1871. After 1871
there were no candidates for this degree for several years.
But in 1875 the Legislature of Michigan, at the solicitation of a mem-
ber from the Upper Peninsula, voted the establishment of a School of
Mines at the University, and appropriated funds for two years for the new
professorships created by the act, which also made provision for a profes-
sorship in Architecture. The chair of Mining Engineering thus founded
was offered to Prof. Pettee; he accepted it, removed to Ann Arbor, and
entered upon his duties in the fall of 1875. The Legislature of 1877 failed
to renew the appropriation for the School of Mines, but made provision ipr
a Professor of Ge»logy. Prof. Pettee, therefore, a second time saw the
department to which he was devoting his energies terminated by a with-
drawal of the funds, and he resigned the chair of Mining. He was at once
appointed Professor of Geology in charge of Mining Engineering. This posi-
tion he has practically occupied until the present time, although the title
»f his office has been several times changed,—in 1879 to Professor of Mir*
eralogy and Economic Geolegy, and in 1881 to Professor of Mineralogy
Economic Geology and Mining Engineering. For fifteen years, therefore
the work in MiniMg Engineering has been done by Prof. Pettee.


The Technic.
As he desired to spend another summer in California in field work in
the region of the auriferous gravels under the direction of Prof. Whitney,
and work up the results of his examinations, he took a leave of absence
for that purpose for the first half of the college year 1879-80. His able
report of that season's work appeared as an appendix to Vol. I of Prof.
Whitney's "Contributions to American Geology," published by the Mu-
seum of Comparative Geology at Cambridge, and it shows that careful
examination of phenomena, weighing of evidence, and painstaking accu-
racy, which those best acquainted with Prof. Pettee always expect in
papers prepared by his hand.
As the instruction in Crystallography for Pharmacy students natu-
rally fell into his hands, he has met in the class-room the large number of
students in that flourishing department and has been catalogued as a
member of its faculty also.
Students who have pursued lines of study under his charge have found
no instructor more ready to adapt his hours to their convenience, and to
give all of his time they might desire, both in and out of the class-room,
to assist them in becoming acquainted with his favorite subjects. In the
various changes which have been made in the college work, the introduc-
tion of the elective courses and the University system, since his coining to
Michigan, he has rendered most valuable counsel and service in the dis-
cussions as to steps to be taken and in the preparation and revision of
published courses and announcements. The editing of the University
Calender, a work requiring great care iu collation and revision, has been
in his hands for several years.
From 1871 to 1875 he was a member of the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences, of Boston, his membership terminating, under the provision
of the Constitution of the Academy, upon his removing from Massachu-
setts. He was elected a member of the American Association for the Ad-
vancement of Science in 1875; was Assistant Secretary of the association
in 1886; was largely instrumental in insuring the success of the Ann Arbor
meeting; and was General Secretary in 1887. He has also been a member
of the American Metrological Society for several years, and is one of the
original Fellows of the Geological Society of America. He joined the
American Institute of Mining Engineers in 1871, the first year of its organ-
ization; was one of its managers in 1873; was elected to the same office iu
1889; and was one of the Vice-Presidents in 1882-3. At different times he
has also done much work in preparing their transactions for publication
and in seeing them through the press, his qualifications as an editor being
of the first order.
He served as a member of the U. S. Assay Commission in 1889.


BY JOHN W. LANGLEY, PITTSBURGH, PA.
Steel may conveniently be divided into two kinds, viz.: Tool Steel and
Structural Steel, because the purposes for which they are used call for a
metal which must, in the extreme or typical cases, perform very different
functions.
In Structural Steel toughness and a moderately high breaking
strength under tension, combined with medium hardness, are the proper-
ties most sought after, while in Tool Steel great hardness, and great
strength under compressive stress are qualities essentially necessary, and
to obtain these we are obliged to be contented with greatly inferior tough-
ness and ductility when cold. To these two divisions might be added a
third, the Spring Steels, which lie intermediate between them, but as the
highest grades of this class, such as watch and clock springs, must be
made out of the same material as tool steel, while the lower grades of
railroad and carriage springs can very well be produced from structural
material, it does not seem necessary to make more than the two funda-
mental divisions.
The uses to which tool steel is put cause it to be wrought chiefly into
two general shapes, viz.: those where its chief duty is to hold up an edge
or thin wedge of metal against forces tending to wear it down or to
crumble it away by small fractures, as in the case of lathe tools and
punches for metal, or of wood-working implements. The other general
form is where the metal must be highly resistant on its face, as in the
case of dies, hammers, and anvils, or steel rolls.
These two kinds of function are not in all respects compatible with
each other, neither can the best cutting edge or anvil face be formed from
any one kind of steel which represents the average requirements of its
respective general shape, so it will be readily apparent that the term
tool steel does not cover simply one kind of material, but rather a group
of materials having a general resemblance but with many specific differ-
ences.
This fact that tool steel is not one but many is not widely known, per-
haps it is within the truth to say that not one mechanic or engineer in one


The Technic.
hundred has fully grasped this idea; it is one of the primary troubles of
the tool steel manufacturer to find out just what kind of steel his custo-
mer wants, and it is an important part of his mental capital to know,
often from long and expensive trials, which ome of the various grades, or
tempers of steel will be best adapted for a given kind of work. Unless the
customer knows from his own experience exactly what he wants it is bet-
ter for him to specify the required duty to be performed and leave the
selection of the material to the manufacturer.
Speaking broadly, a piece of tool steel may be considered as the ma-
terial abode or locus of three general mechanical properties and one
special one: the three general ones are, hardness, elasticity, and ductility
when cold, including under the latter the property of '• flow "; the special
one is that of acquiring great hardness when rapidly cooled, and partially
losing this when subsequently tempered. Now the maximum degree of
any one of the first three is incompatible with a simultaneous maximum
of either sf the others, and is partially so with respect to the last. The
various kinds of tool steel, therefore, represent different proportions in
the admixture of these four properties, their number is theoretically
infinite, but it is found that from fifteen to twenty distinctly separated
tempers answer most of the practical requirements.
To obtain these fifteen kinds demands variations in the chemical com-
position and mechanical treatment of the steel which need to be executed
with a precision and certainty scarcely inferior to the carefully planned
conduct of a scientific experiment in a chemical or physical laboratory.
The necessary chemical conditions for carbon tool steel are that the
finished metal should contain, as nearly as possible, only iron, carbon and
manganese, and perhaps a little silicon, the first three being absolutely
essential, the latter somewhat doubtful. It must not contain more than a
few thousandths of any other elements. Phosphorus and arsenic being
especially prejudicial.
These elements must exist within the following ranges, and the quan-
tities in any one temper of steel must be known to the maker within the
appended limits.

The essential difference between these and tool steel lies in the pro-
portions of Carbon, Sulphur and Phosphorus.
Since carbon is the controlling element in carbon steel it has been
customary to make the division into "high" and "low" steel; these
terms do not mean superior or inferior quality, but denote steels having
respectively over and under 0.50 % of carbon. Tool steel is high carbon
necessarily, while structural steel may be either high or low, but is gener-
ally low.
The word temper already used several times in this article was a term
originally devised by the steel maker to denote those kinds of material
which experience had shown to be best adapted to particular kinds of
work. We now know that this depends mainly on the quantity of carbon
present, provided it is in the combined or active condition. If the other
elements lie near to the numbers given for tempers x, y, and z, in the
foregoing table, then the carbon becomes the controlling element. Much
confusion often arises between the words temper and tempering. The
latter, which has long been in use to describe certain changes in hardened
steel caused by the application of relatively low heats, depends on a
property apparently exclusively belonging to steel and will be again re-


The Technic.
ferred to in the course of this paper. The former word denotes perma-
nent states due to differences of composition; it might be applied to the
various bronzes and brasses but it is not customary to do so, for practi-
cally it is very little used except by makers and sellers of steel.
Tools to be used for the following purposes should have tempers cor-
responding to quantities of carbon within the limits given below:
For implements requiring ability to withstand shocks, as hammers,
picks, etc., the carbon should be kept low, in general under 0.70.
For cutting tools, as reamers, taps, axes, lathe tools, etc., a medium
carbon from 0.70 to 1.20.
Articles like razors and surgical implements where great keenness of
edge is necessary, and at the same time only a light mechanical duty is
demanded, may advantageously hold carbon up to the limit where steel
begins to become cast iron.
In the above brief outline of the composition of steel nothing has
been said of the gases which are always found in it and which are be-
lieved to have an important influence on its mechanical properties. It is
positively known that all steel contains nitrogen and hydrogen. It is
probable that it also contains carbon monoxide and oxygen in a free or
dissolved state. Some metallurgists, however, hold that the oxygen is
not free but occurs as dissolved oxide of iron. The whole subject of the
nature and mode of existence of gases in steel has not been completely
investigated. Besides these bodies another very important variable affect-
ing the composition of steel is the mode of occurrence of carbon. It is
admitted by all chemists that this element may be found in iron in two
states, graphitic and combined; it is highly probable also that it occurs
as semi-graphitic carbon, and not improbable that it may have a third
and possibly a fourth form.
The production on a large scale of so complex and so variable a ma-
terial requires technical skill of a very high order combined with cease-
less vigilance and care. While there are many ways of making steel
there is to-day only one known method of producing the better grades of
tool steel. This is by the crucible process, of which only a meagre out-
line can be given here. Wrought iron, especially low in phosphorus and
sulphur, is cut up into pieces averaging 4" x3" x and packed cold into
plumbago crucibles which hold generally about ninety pounds, though
other sizes are occasionally used. The necessary carbon was formerly
given to the iron previously, by the method of cementation; this process
is now nearly obsolete and is replaced by a cheaper but equally
good one which consists in adding to the crucible, or pot as it is called, a


9
certain portion of carbon in the form of charcoal. Manganese is added
in weighed portions of ferro-manganese or of oxide or both, the pot is
closed by its cap and then lowered into the melting hole of a regenerative
gas furnace. The melting occupies from three to four hours, at the end of
which time the pot is withdrawn, its cap taken off, and the thin layer of
slag on top of the metal is removed by an implement called a mop. The
contents, which are at a dazzling white heat, are then poured into cast
iron moulds where they rapidly solidify, forming the ingot. If this is
from a single pot its size will be usually 3%" x3)4" or 4" x4" and about
30" long. Moulds of almost unlimited size can be filled by having a
large number of pots ready to be poured in succession.
The above process seems very simple in the description, but it is not
so in the execution, because there are four influences actively at work
during the melting which must be controlled within very narrow limits or
failure is the result. The first of these is in getting the proper quantity
of carbon into the steel. Since the iron contains varying amounts of
oxide on its surface some of the charcoal will be consumed in reducing
this oxide, and this is a variable quantity; then too, since the crucibles
are made of plumbago, some carbon will be taken up by the steel from
the pot itself. The writer of this paper has never succeeded in bringing
this down to less than 0.20 % for thoroughly melted steel. The second
influence is from the silica of the clay of the crucibles, a portion of which
is reduced to silicon and combines with the steel. The third comes from
the gases within the crucible which are produced or gain access during
the melting. If a pot is poured the moment the charge is melted the
metal will be so full of gas as to cause it to foam over the top of the mold
like soda water in a tumbler and the ingot will be full of bubbles which
remain as cavities after solidification; the steel must be kept melted till
all of this gas which can leave it in the pot is either expelled or decom-
posed through a complex reaction which occurs between it and the silicon
and manganese present. This condition of minimum gas is called dead
melting. It is worthy of note that this minimum is never a zero, some
gas always remains and may, in spite of every care, make an ingot un-
sound.
The fourth condition is the management of the temperature. Dead
melting and the elimination of gas depend on bringing the heat near the
close of the operation up to nearly the limit of endurance of the pots, and
indeed beyond the point where they can long resist rapid destruction.
Much skill is shown in apportioning the duration and intensity of this
critical period of high temperature; if too brief the ingots will be unsound,


The Technic.
if too long the quality of the steel is much impaired, and the life of the
pots shortened. The normal life of a pot when steel is thoroughly dead
melted is from four to five "heats."
After the ingot cools it is" found that at the moment of solidification
contraction occurs, this is a phenomenon common to many crystalline
bodies when passing from the fluid to the solid state, accordingly in highly
crystalline steel, or that containing over 0.60% of carbon, the shrinkage of
the bottom portions of the ingot causes the still fluid part at the top to
gink down into the space thus left, and this results in producing a conical
tapering cavity extending from the top to some point in the axis of the in-
got which usually does not exceed one-fifth of its length; this is called the
pipe.
The cold ingots are next taken to an anvil and part of the top is
broken off by blows from a sledge, this is called topping. The purpose of
this is twofold. In the first place it insures the removal of the parts sur-
rounding the pipe which would not weld into a sound bar; secondly, it
enables the quantity of carbon which the steel contains, and on which its
temper depends, to be ascertained by the appearance of the fracture. Few
industrial operations demand so highly specialized a training of the eye as
this, for it is a regular matter of routine to estimate the carbon to less than
0.10%, that is to less than one thousandth part of the weight of the ingot.
It will by this time have become apparent that the production of a
good ingot of tool steel is beset with many difficulties, and that the whole
process is one of great nicety and skill; it is also one having several unex-
plained mysteries attached to it. For instance, steel made by any other
process may be very fair for structural or even for heavy spring steel but
it will not answer for the best tools. It has been sometimes alleged that
this is because equally good material is not used in the Bessemer and
Open Hearth processes. This is an error. There is some peculiar quality
or substance in the product of these methods which causes the steel to be
lacking in strength and the power to hold an edge as compared with cruci-
ble steel. Long experience in Europe and this country has established
this as a fact although chemistry has not yet completely solved the mys-
tery of the cause. Here is one specific instance out of many. The writer
took a very pure Swedish Bessemer billet having the following composi-
tion:
Carbon 0.60
Silicon 0.02
Phosphorus 0.025
Sulphur 0.008
Manganese 0.045

A portion of it was made into a tool and found to be inferior. Another
portion was then melted in a crucible and treated in all respects as for
making tool steel, the product was again tested and found to be scarcely
improved, being but little better than common machinery steel. Thus,
even so radical an operation as melting, did not remove the injurious
something which the Bessemer process had put into it.
The mechanical processes by which the ingot is finally changed into a
finished bar are also ones of much nicety and attended by critical stages
in the management of the temperature and the intensity of permissible
stresses given by the hammers or the rolls, but the limits of this paper
will not admit of space being given to them, and it will probably be of
more interest to pass to that side of the subject which chiefly concerns the
user of steel, viz., shop practice in forging and hardening.
Every blacksmith knows, at least in theory, that tool steel must not
be heated to the same temperature as iron for forging. The latter may
very well stand a yellow or yellow-white heat, while the former will be
quite spoiled by such treatment; the usual directions are to bring it to a
"cherry-red," but this term is very indefinite.because the amount of day-
light in the shop changes the apparent tint of the hot metal, and because
all steel does not demand the same temperature. In general, both for
forging and hardening, the higher the carbon the lower should be the
heat. This appears to be owing to the general law that crystalline bodies,
so to speak, begin to get ready for a change of state some time in advance
of the actual transition; thus water has its point of maximum density at
4'C. and between this and O'O. it is preparing to freeze; certain alloys of
lead and tin, also of lead, tin, and bismuth, pass through an intermediate
condition between the solid and the fluid states which can best be de-
scribed as granular-pasty. Similarly, since carbon lowers the melting
point of iron, high carbon steel begins to get ready for melting long before
any signs of fluidity appear. When the carbon is above 1 % the initiation
of the granular-pasty stage appears to begin at the point where a red heat
merges into yellow. When the granular condition is fully established a
smart blow of a hamn»er will scatter the steel in small fragments and no
forging is possible. So exactly does the grain of steel depend on the heat
that it may be expressed in a law first laid down by William Metcalf,
"The fractured surface of a piece of steel, broken cold, registers the last
highest heat to which it has been subjected." This rule is reliable pro-
vided the piece has not been forged. Heavy thorough forging tends to
undo the injurious effects of heat, but the light hammering employed
to merely redress a tool will not effect the necessary correction; therefore,


The Technic.
steel above 1% of carbon should not be heated for forging above a bright
orange heat. If under 0.90% carbon it may be given a dark to bright
lemon heat.
Probably neglect of the above rule has spoiled more good steel than
any other error of manipulation except the abuse of the hardening, or
"water quenching " process.
No single operation employed in the manufacture of a steel tool is
more important or more delicate than this, and it may truly be said no
one is more frequently injuriously used. What has just been said about
the proper heat for forging applies with double force to the operation of
hardening because it is a much more violent process and sets up stresses
in the particles of the metal which much exceed anything we can produce
by purely mechanical means. To cool off a piece of red hot steel in water
seems at first sight a very mild proceeding compared to hitting it with a
steam hammer, but the reverse is really the case: stresses of the value of
more than 150,000 lbs. to the square inch may easily be produced, and it
is probable that with every case these stresses are never less than several
tens of thousands of pounds. The real cause of hardening is not fully
known, of course it is molecular in character, perhaps also atomic, but
certainly one of the secondary or mechanical causes of the great strain to
which hardened steel is subjected lies in the fact that the specific gravity
of hardened steel is less than that of the unhardened piece, and conse-
quently its volume is greater. This increase of volume is also a function
of the quantity of carbon present, as is shown by the following results
which were first published by the writer in the transactions of the Ameri-
can Association for the Advancement of Science, Vol. 25, 1876.
In the following table the bars were made from the ingots which
stand at the head of the columns. The bars were heated at one end to a
yellow-white heat, that is, to the temperature at which they gave off
scintillations; in this condition they are said to be burned, although
"overheated" is a better name for their state.

and not hammered), also of six hammered bars, each bar being over-
heated at one end and cold at the other, in this state plunged iuto water

The temperature to which the densities are referred is G0° F.
It is thus seen that the density decreases with the increase of carbon
from No. 12 to No. 5. Below this number the influence of physical condi-
tions, such as rapidity of cooling, etc., cause irregularities in the descent,
although in a general sense the numbers continue to vary inversely as the
carbon.
Also in the bar samples it will be seen that the specific gravity de-
creases with the increase in carbon, and also with the temperature of
quenching in water for steel containing more than 0.80 carbon.
In hardening steel by cooling it in water two principal dangers are in-
curred, cracking and overheating. The stresses which rupture the steel
come from two causes: first, the general lowering of temperature which
necessarily tends to shrink a cool solid interior, which is in contact with
the water, down onto a still hot and slightly plastic central core. Second,
the reduced specific gravity of the hardened piece indicates the per-
manent retention of stresses between the expanded and the unexpanded
portions of the metal.
The above table shows that these increase rapidly with the tempera-
ture at which the bar was put into the water, and undoubtedly the chief
cause of cracks is this anomalous expansion of hardening, because no
other metal except high steel shows it in anything like the same degree.
Quite large pieces of mild steel or of the various copper alloys may be
suddenly cooled without cracking. Also they are not by this means ex-
panded as tool steel is, hence, we conclude that this, too, is one of the
many mysterious properties conferred upon iron by carbon.
The effect of overheating seems to be traceable to the same element,
for there is trustworthy chemical evidence that the condition of carbon in


Thk Technic.
steel is modified by hardening, tempering, or annealing. The appearance
of a fresh fracture made on a hardened piece of steel is a very perfect in-
dicator of the heat it had when it entered the water. In the six numbers
given in the table, number one will have a brilliant coarse sandy grain
which always denotes overbeating or burning. Such steel is permanently
ruined for all good work. Hot forging will only partially restore it. Num-
ber six will have the crystalline grain and slightly bluish mild lustre of
the original piece. Somewhere between these extremes, as numbers
three or four, the bar will be found to have the finest grain of any of the
pieces, it will be brighter than number six, but much less so than number
one; its lustre will be satiny rather than crystalline; it will be hard
enough to scratch glass, if of high steel, and it will not be excessively
brittle like number six. This state is known as refined. It is the only
proper condition for hardened steel, and it represents the nearest possible
attainment of a simultaneous maximum of hardness and elasticity; more
elasticity with some ductility, but with a partial loss of hardness, can be
given to it by the subsequent process of tempering.
All the above facts, coupled with the practice of the best steel workers,
show that the lowest possible heat at which steel will thoroughly harden
is the refiuing temperature and the only one which should be used, since
the danger of cracking is reduced to a minimum and the injury to the
grain is practically nothing. No exact limit of temperature can be laid
down, for it varies with the quantity of carbon present, and also slightly
with the form and size of the tool. A very beautiful practical means of
ascertaining the "refining heat" for any given kind of steel was invented
some years ago by William Metcalf, which consists in taking a bar of the
steel under trial and nicking it at intervals of about one inch, starting at
one end and extending about a foot. Then heat the bar as evenly as pos-
sible so that it maybe black red at, say the eighth notch, and scintillating
at number one, then plunge into water and break off the pieces by a ham-
mer. When the fracture characteristic of refining is reached its place on
the bar will give a clue to the right temperature for hardening that grade
and size of steel.
The same author has also deyised the following illustrations of the
effects of refining and overheating in the hardening process.
The upper row of squares in Fig. 1, represents the proportionate sizes
of the "grain " or crystalline particles in a piece of high carbon tool steel
which has been nicked and plunged into water in the manner already de-
scribed; the smallest square shows the grain when cooled from a point

just visibly red hot in diffused 'daylight; the largest one a similar treat-
ment at the temperature of incipient fusion. The lower row shows the
appearance of a piece of steel of about 0.40 carbon.

The grain of the cold or natural bar is not the smallest possible. The
finest grain is that given by the refining temperature, that is by the best
heat for hardening.
Owing to the rounded character of the crystalline facets, and to the
brilliant luster of the fractured surfaces it is difficult, if not impossible, to
make micrometer measurements of them under the microscope. State-
ments of their size is therefore merely guess work. The writer of this
paper estimates that the largest grain of figure one would be at least one
fiftieth of an inch in diameter, and that the corresponding refined grain
would be not ovar one five hundredth of an inch. With certain alloy-
steels it might be less than one thous*ndth of an inch.
One or two practical hiats may not be out of place. Since hardening
is caused by the rapid withdrawal of heat any non-conductor tends to pre-
vent it. A film of grease on the surface of the water coats the hot steel as
it passes through it and interferes with the escape of heat. So too will a

heavy forge scale left on the piece, or even a little deposit of ashes or of
soot. Indeed, certain results can only be secured by having the metal
bright before the final heating, although the light scale left by finishing
at a black-red heat does not interfere greatly. Very annoying soft spots
from the size of a pin head to that of a silver dollar may be caused by de-
posits of ashes scarcely visible to the eye. When they appear the metal
should have all the old scale removed by grinding, and it should be re-
hardened. Generally it will be found that the local spots will be removed
Many a piece of steel has been condemned for want of knowing this
simple rule.
Another detail of shop practice of much importance is to secure
gradual and uniform heating. This is much more difficult than is usually
supposed because iron is not a very good conductor of heat, and because
the flow of heat itself depends on differences of temperature; now these
need not be great to carry the metal beyond the limits for the refining
effect and the piece of steel may be correct at the surface while still only
black or black-red at the centre; or conversely, if right at the centre it
may be overheated or even burned at the surface. The writer tried the
following experiment to illustrate the importance of time.
An iron tube three-fourths of an inch in diameter was brought up to
an even red heat. A piece of round steel three-eights of an inch in diam-
eter and two inches long was pushed into the middle of the tube. Now,
notwithstanding its being surrounded on all sides by hot walls it was
twenty minutes before it acquired the same temperature as the tube.
At Nykroppa in Sweden they make a specialty of very high carbon
Bessemer steel. To heat a fourteen inch ingot of 1.50 carbon metal takes
over two hours; the ingot is placed at one end of a long furnace when it
is not even red hot, and is gradually advanced by eight stages of fifteen
minutes each to the hottest part. &lt;
Uneven heating is almost certain to cause either warping or cracking
unless the piece is very small. To heat a piece of two inches diameter of
high steel ought to require not less than ten minutes, and the fire must at
no time be excessively hot.
The following illustration by William Metcalf partly explains the
cause of cracking from too rapid heating and subsequent cooling in water.
The refined grain is supposed to be at the centre of the piece. The
outside portions are overheated, and the corners are burned. The piece
will probably crack as shown.
All rectangular and irregular shapes require the utmost care in heat-
ing or the corners are sure to crack off', or to be badly overheated.

The expression " tempering " in shop practice is used in a different
sense from the technical word temper of the first part of this paper. Shop
tempering is a graduated annealing performed on the hardened tool.
The temperatures, which are all below redness, are indicated with much
precision by the well-known series of colors given below; these colors
themselves being due to the interference of light in passing through trans-
parent or translucent films of magnetic oxide of iron formed on the polished
hardened steel as it is progressively heated. The following colors have
been found to answer well for tools to be used for the purposes here given:
Colors.
Light straw.
Bright to light straw.
Copper color.
Purple to dark blue.
Light blue to black.
In conclusion the writer will express his belief that it scarcely exag-
gerates the case to say there is no delicate organic material, such as milk
or meat, which is more easily spoiled by heat or which requires more
careful watching when over the fire than does tool steel. The only essen-
tial difference being that the critical points on the temperature scale are
so unlike. It is as difficult to bring a piece of steel from the fire at the
refining heat neither overdone nor underdone as it is to perform the

What has been said in this paper applies only to carbon steel. Alloy
steels are coming into use for special purposes, but none of them have yet
been exhaustively studied.


BY A. ZIWET.
In the Engineering Department of our University, as in all engineer-
ing and polytechnic schools, a considerable number of the courses pre-
scribed for students in civil, mechanical, and electrical engineering are
devoted to pure mathematics. The branches of mathematics thus required
as a preparatory study for the engineer are very nearly the same in all
first-class institutions; they are, besides the elements (algebra, geometry,
trigonometry), descriptive geometry, analytic geometry, the differential
and integral calculus, and analytical mechanics.
The most obvious proof of the necessity of these studies for the engi-
neer may perhaps be found in the universal consensus with which they are
at the present time adopted in all higher institutions intended for training
engineers. For it is a fact, in spite of the habitual scoffing of "practical
men" at theoretical studies, that even in this, most eminently practical,
engineering profession the university graduate finds it easier to secure
employment and (which means more) to be promoted and make headway
in his career, than a young man entering the profession without thorough
college training.
And yet the complaint is frequently heard that much time is wasted
in the study of purely theoretical matters and of abstruse and useless the-
ories too difficult for the understanding of ordinary mortals.
Let me say a word right here as t,o this presumed difficulty of the
higher mathematics, of those branches at least that are ordinarily taught
in engineering schools. There is no doubt but that the study of analytic
geometry, of the calculus, of mechanics, and in particular the practical
training in these sciences so essential for acquiring the power of applying
them understandingly, requires both time and work on the part of the
student. But if the study be pursued in the proper way, there is no rea-
son why any clear-thinking mind of ordinary ability should not master
these subjects provided it brings to it the necessary amount of application.
Mathematics (I use the word here throughout as denoting only these
more elementary branches mentioned above) is nothing but systematized


The Technic.
common sense; and a "mathematical mind" means nothing if not a
mind capable of reasoning accurately and systematically. If anybody's
mind is "not built that way," he had better keep aloof from the engi-
neering profession. In our times when many hundreds of students well
trained in the higher mathematics are sent out every year from the vari-
ous universities and engineering schools all over the civilized world, it is
about time to abandon the old prejudice against this science as something
recondite and unfathomable for ordinary intelligence.
I think it is safe to say that more copies of text-books on the calculus
are sold annually at the present time than there were arithmetics two
hundred years ago.
Times have changed. Four hundred years ago it was regarded an
unusual accomplishment for a man to have penetrated into the mysteries
of ordinary multiplication and division. In those times when the citizens
of a German town appointed a schoolmaster they would stipulate in the
contract that it should be his duty to instruct the youth of the town in
reading and writing and the use of numbers including addition and sub-
traction; but the processes of multiplication and division he should not
teach, these being too complicated and, besides, of most doubtful utility.*
The standard of mathematical instruction in the higher institutions of
learning was correspondingly low. In the middle ages, for many centuries
the "Euclid" that served as a text-book of geometry in the convent
schools consisted of a Latin translation of the axioms and definitions, fol-
lowed by the propositions (but without proofs) of the first book of Euclid's
Elements.
After the revival of learning and the invention of printing this state of
things changed rapidly. Not only were the works of the ancient Greek
geometers published in the original and repeatedly translated, but a new
science of mathematics was gradually evolved, beginning with algebra,
extending into analytic geometry, and culminating finally in the great dis-
covery of the infinitesimal calculus.
Still, even during the eighteenth century this modern science of math-
ematics remained the possession of only a few; the mathematical in-
struction in the universities did not keep pace with the development of the
science. It is only in the course of the last seventy-five years that the
study of higher mathematics has become more widely diffused. And this
diffusion is no doubt due in a large measure to the rapid advance of phys-

ical science and, above all, to the requirements of the technical pro-
fessions.
The engineer in the present and highest meaning of the term, is essen-
tially a product of modern times. There was no need for him before the
invention of the steam engine, of the steamship, of railways, of iron roofs
and bridges, of the manifold applications of electricity of our day; and
consequently there was no need, then, for special engineering schools.
The earliest institutions worthy of this name, and the most celebrated
even at the present time, the Ecole normale and the Ecole polytechnique of
Paris, were an outgrowth of the feverish enthusiasm of the first French
revolution. Both were founded in 1794, and their establishment and or-
ganization are largely due to the great French mathematicians Lagrange,
Laplace, and in particular to Monge, the inventor of descriptive geometry.
It has sometimes been said, and not unjustly, that the French revolution
was brought about by the philosophers. But it is an equally noteworthy
fact, though not so commonly noticed, that the truly great and lasting
achievements of this revolution were accomplished by the mathematicians
who took a remarkably prominent part, not in the work of destruction,
but in the more laborious work of reorganization; it may suffice .to men-
tion the measurement of arcs for determining the figure of the earth, the
introduction of the metric system, the foundation of great schools of ap-
plied science.
But this only is passing.—The two years' course in the Ecole polytech-
nique covers only the purely scientific studies preparatory to enter-
ing the special applied schools, such as the Ecole des ponts el chaussies, the
Ecole des mines, etc. The mathematical instruction in the Ecole polytech-
nique is, and always has been, of the highest grade. A very large number
of its professors are well known as eminent mathematicians; and the
graduates ever in after-life are proud of calling themselves "anciens elevcs
de I'Ecole polytechnique."
The development of the engineering schools of Germany was very dif-
ferent from that in France. There was no model central institution around
which others could group themselves. Quite independently of each other
a number of schools were founded in different parts of Germany; and it
was only after a long period of gradual development that the present more
or less uniform organization of the Polytechnikum, or Technische Hochschule,
was reached. In one respect these twelve or fifteen German engineering
schools certainly do agree: they all require of the young engineer a tho-
rough training in mathematics.
The best engineering schools of Italy, of Russia, of our own coun-


The Technic.
try, have all adopted at least this feature of the system of the French and
German schools. The requirement of a hroad and solid mathematical
foundation for engineering studies may therefore be regarded the natural
outcome of the historical development of these schools. It is now fully
established as the result of a long series of experiments in organizing en-
gineering schools under widely varying circumstances all over the civilized
world.
Let us now enquire a little more in detail what constitutes the real
value of this mathematical preparation. As in the case of any other pre-
paratory study, we may distinguish between two main aspects of its use-
fulness, according as we look to the method of the science, or to its subject-
matter.
Under the former aspect, mathematics is intended to accustom the
mind to clear and accurate thinking. This side of its educational value is
not always sufficiently appreciated, in particular by practical men, even
by those who have had in their youth the advantage of a good scientific
education. A man in after-life is only too prone to forget that in the course
of his college career his mind has grown not only in mass, so to speak, that
is through the material accumulated in the form of new facts acquired, but
also in what might be called intensity, through the gradual development
of his reasoning powers.
It is only too frequently forgotten that the acquisition of facts alone is
of no value; that it is only the power to digest them, to sift and group
them, to draw correct inferences from them,—in a word, to put these facts
to practical use, which renders their possession valuable.
An example will best illustrate my meaning.
The modern science of mechanics dates its origin from Galileo's inves-
tigation of the laws of falling bodies. What constituted his power? What
made him the inaugurator of a new era in science? In reply it is often
loosely stated that it is the "inductive method" that characterizes mod-
ern science in contradistinction to the speculations of the Ancients; and
only too often is this inductive method represented as being equivalent to
observing and collecting facts. Nohting could be more misleading. If
Galileo had restricted himself to the mere observation of the facts
of nature, • he could never have discovered that light and heavy bodies
fall with equal velocity. For common experience certainly teaches that
light bodies fall more slowly than heavy ones. But Galileo applied math-
ematical reasoning to the facts of observation. He argued that if heavy
bodies fall more rapidly than light ones, then two pieces of metal of equal
weight soldered together must reach the ground sooner than each of the


pieces taken separately and dropped from the same height. In other
words, he devised a scientific experiment which is distinguished from ordi-
nary observation by the introduction of mathematical principles.
All clear and accurate reasoning is necessarily in a degree mathemati-
cal; in fact, it is hardly too much to say that the reasoning becomes clear
and accurate exactly in the same degree in which mathematics is intro-
duced. Thus Galileo began with weighing and measuring, two operations
involving elementary mathematical principles. Next he expressed the
results of his experiments by means of algebraic formulae to give them
conciseness and precision. Finally, extending his investigations over the
motion of projectiles, he plotted the path of the projectile and studying
the curve so obtained found it to be a parabola.
And if we should follow the development of mechanics in the hands of
Huyghens, of Newton, of the Bernoullis, of d'Alembert, of Lagrange, we
might easily show how every advance in this science, which lies at 'the
foundation of all engineering, was brought about by some new application
of mathematical methods.
And this leads us to the other aspect of the value of mathematical
studies for the engineer, viz.: the value of the mathematical knowledge
itself. The two ways of viewing the subject are, however, closely con-
nected owing to the intimate relation in mathematics between methods
and subject-matter.
The untrained mind lacks the habit of consistent and precise reason-
ing. Every observant teacher knows this; but the student is apt to forget
that as his body, so also his mind needs for its growth and healthy devel-
opment not food only, but constant practice of all its powers and activities.
No other study affords a training as valuable to the engineer as mathe-
matics. The mathematical class-room it the gymnasium of the mind.
Here he will learn to distinguish between true accuracy and fanciful ex-
aggeration of precision; he will learn how to state a question clearly, how
to reduce it to its lowest terms so to speak, and to put it in proper shape
for solution; he will learn what problems can readily be solved and what
problems it is difficult or impossible to solve; he will acquire and practice
that power of the mind so important for the engineer of forming a clear
mental image of the shapes of bodies, of their relative motions and mutual
reactions.
The student in his college course will soon find how constantly he is
expected to apply all (or perhaps even more than) his acquired mathe-
matical knowledge. The more thorough his training in mathematics, the
easier will he find his work in the engineering sciences. Any neglect in


The Technic.
the preparatory mathematical studies is sure to avenge itself in the higher
cosrses.
A thorough knowledge of the elements of higher mathematics is abso-
lutely necessary for a true understanding of modern physics, and this the
engineer should try to attain as far as possible. For how can he make in-
telligent use of the forces of nature without understanding their working?
The higher branches of kinematics, dynamics and statics; the study of
the potential and its application to the theory of gravitational, electrical,
and magnetic attraction; the mechanical theory of heat; mathematical
optics; the theory of elasticity; hydromechanics; these among others
might be mentioned as branches of mathematical physics closely related
to the engineering sciences. Here then opens a wide and useful field of
elective mathematical work for the engineer.
Modern physics is making such rapid strides in the application of
mathematics that the elements of the higher mathematics that form the
required work in engineering schools are insufficient for its study. Some
of the subjects mentioned above will therefore require as a preparation
the study of certain special branches of mathematics, such as the theory
of least squares, differential equations, elliptic functions, modern geome-
try, Fourier's series, spherical harmonics, etc.
In what precedes I have purposely omitted all reference to pure math-
ematics as a science.
What the engineer absolutely wants is only the study of the more ele-
mentary branches of higher mathematics which for the mathematician
form but the entrance gate to his science. This of course does not mean
that it is not desirable for the engineer to acquire a fuller knowledge of the
real science of mathematics. In fact, it would seem but natural that he
should pursue his theoretical studies a little beyond the limits of what is
absolutely required. By doing so he will form for himself a higher aim in
life than is afforded^by the every day routine of professional work. Math-
ematics will thus gain for him an ethical value; he may pursue it as a re-
laxation from his daily toil, as a favorite study, just as we see many a
physician devote his leisure to some favorite branch of natural science, or
as a lawyer will spend his spare time in historical or philosophical studies.
As regards the use of mathematics in actual engineering practice, it is
difficult to say anything briefly and in a general way; so great is the di-
versity of the various branches of engineering. The application of the
mathematical and physical sciences to the useful arts is continually and
rapidly growing. It cannot be denied that there are many practical engi-
neers who "know precious little" of mathematics and still are "getting


25
along very well" in life. But it is not the object of a college course merely
to enable a man to earn his living in some narrow line of professional work.
College training should give the engineer a broader and higher conception
of his profession. On the one hand, it should make him ready for any
emergency and prevent him from being necessarily confined to a narrow
special line of work; on the other, it should enable him to excel in his
specialty, to contribute something to the actual progress of his profession
and to grapple successfully with the new problems that daily arise in en-
gineering; above all it should make him a man of broad intelligence and
not merely a wage-earner.
He who is satisfied with following the beaten path, copying the old
designs for bridges or engines, repeating the same processes in manufactur-
ing or in surveying, needs little science of any sort. But such men will of
course only follow, not lead their profession.
The world moves; and it results from the laws of relative motion that
the man who does not move must be constantly lagging behind. There is
little hope for the sluggard in our rapidly progressing age; and perhaps I
may be allowed to conclude with the verses in which Wm. J. Macquorn
Rankine, the great Scotch engineer and physicist who has probably done
more than any other man for the elevation of the engineering profession
in England, ridicules this dangerous spirit of self-sufficiency.
THE THREE-FOOT KULE.
"When I was bound apprentice, and learned to use my hands,
Folk never talked of measures that came from foreign lands:
Now I'm a British workman, too old to go to school;
So whether the chisel or file I hold, I'll stick to my three-foot rule.
"Some talk of millimetres, and some of kilogrammes,
And some of decilitres, to measure beer and drams;
But I'm a British workman, too old to go to school;
So by pounds I'll eat, and by quarts I'll drink, and I'll work by
my three-foot rule.
"A party of astronomers went measuring of the earth,
And forty million metres they took to be its girth;
Five hundred million inches, though, go through from pole to pole;
So let's stick to inches, feet, and yards, and the good old three-foot rule.
"The great Egyptian pyramid's a thousand yards about;
And when the masons finished it, they raised a joyful shout;
The chap that planned that building, I'm bound he was no fool;
And now 'tis proved beyond a doubt, he used a three-foot rule.
"Here's a health to every learned man that goes by common sense,
And would not plague the workman on any vain pretence;
But as for those philanthropists, who'd send us back to school,
Oh, bless their eyes, if ever they tries to put down the three-foot rule."


BY A. NOBLE.
Although hydraulic cement enters into all important modern masonry
structures, yet its qualities, its merits and defects are not always well un-
derstood even by those who have had considerable experience in its use.
The engineer is often disappointed by an unexpected failure, and, it may
be added, is sometimes surprised by the excellence of work done under
conditions thought unfavorable.
In technical journals, transactions of societies of engineers and else-
where the subject has been treated in various aspects, but the collection
and weighing of information from these sources is difficult for the young
engineer and it is hoped that a few useful suggestions may be made within
the limits of a short article.
Hydraulic cements in common use in the United States belong to one
of two classes:
1st. Natural cements,—made from certain rocks by burning and
grinding.
2d. Portland cements,—made by mixing clay and carbonate of lime
in proportions found by experiment to be most suitable, and burning and
grinding the mixture.
The ingredients of Portland cement are practically those which give
natural cements the hydraulic property,—the property which causes mor-
tars containing them to harden or set under water. Portland cement of
good quality contains a very small proportion of other ingredients. Its
manufacture is constantly checked by tests of strength and chenjical anal-
ysis and may be called, fairly, a scientific operation. The rock from which
natural cement is made may vary greatly in chemical composition and
still furnish a hydraulic cement; mingled or united with the useful ingre-
dients are others which are inert and still others which are injurious but
which in the aggregate do not totally prevent the setting of the mortar;
practically these elements cannot be eliminated and it is easily seen that
the product obtained from these defective materials must be inferior to
Portland cement. Its manufacture cannot be checked readily by chemical


27
analysis for while it is easy to determine what proportions of a few useful
ingredients will give the best cement, it would be a much more difficult
problem to determine wlraf proportions of other ingredients could be
added without ruining it; the practical difficulty of applying chemical
analysis usefully is increased by the fact that a layer of rock which at one
point is useful may change its character within a few hundred feet and be
inadmissible.
Portland cement being the superior in strength and uniformity would
be used to the exclusion of natural cement were it not for its greater cost;
the ratio of cost per bbl. varies from 2}{ to 1 on the seaboard to 3 to 1 at
inland points in the United States. It is obviously unwise to use the more
expensive article where the cheaper one is good enough and the engineer
must decide which it is most judicious to adopt. A few cases in which
Portland cement should be used may be mentioned: 1st, when a high de-
gree or early development of the strength of the mortar is required; 2d,
where uniformity is essential; that is, where an occasional batch of poor
mortar would be particularly injurious, as, for instance, in a thin wall or
pier carrying a heavy load; 3d, to resist a head of water; 4th, in freezing
weather.
Different cements vary greatly in regard to time required to take initial
set; a very quick setting cement is sometimes essential in order that the
mortar may resist within a few hours the action of the sea or of a current,
pressure of water or a heavy load. Unless the property of setting quickly
is indispensable a cement setting slowly is to be preferred because more
time is given to mix and put in place in the structure before initial set
occurs and because, as a general rule, slow setting cements finally attain
a higher degree of strength.
All Portland cements are expected to be hydraulic in a high degree.
When first made Portland cement may contain particles of unslaked lime
and if used at once these particles will slake after a time and, expanding,
cause cracks in the mortar. Portland cement should therefore be exposed
to the air for a few days after grinding so that the particles of lime may
become slaked. This requirement is generally made in specifications for
cement to be used near the factory but is of less importance here because
of the time required in transit across the Atlantic. Many natural cements
are only moderately hydraulic serving excellently where the structure is
not to be put under water quickly.
The principal object of mixing sand with cement is to cheapen the
mortar; at the same time, it weakens the mortar, so that in determining
proportions of sand and cement the engineer must keep in mind the re-


The Technic.
quirements of the work. If mortar containing little or no sand be exposed
to the sun for a few months it may disintegrate by the formation of small,
fine cracks dividing it into small pieces. Mortar for ordinary uses should
therefore contain at least one part of sand to one part of cement.
When the porportion of sand to cement exceeds 2% to 1 the mortar
will be appreciably porous because the cement will not furnish enough
cement paste to fill the voids in the sand.
In preparing mortar the sand and cement should be mixed thoroughly
and uniformly when dry; after adding the water the mortar should be made
quickly, vigorously and thoroughly and put in the work before setting
begins. Mortar sets less quickly as the proportion of sand is increased.
For important work only high grade cements of either class should be
used. The lower grades of Portland cement may give mortars stronger
than those made with natural cement for a short period but are liable to
deteriorate with age and to injure or destroy the work. For such work
cement should be tested and the cost of the necessary outfit is quickly
repaid.
In testing cement it is sought to show:
1st. Its strength and rate of development of strength.
2nd. Its capacity for niaking mortar when mixed with sand in vari-
ous proportions.
3rd. The presence of unsafe properties, if any exist.
The tensile test is generally used to determine strength. The appli-
ances and methods of testing are fully described in a report to the Ameri-
can Society of Civil Engineers of its committe on a Uniform System for
Tests of Cement submitted January 21, 1885. This system of tests is now
in general use in this country. An exact method should be followed and
the greatest care taken. The difficulty of making satifactory tests is much
greater than one not versed in the subject would suppose.
The following table shows what tensile strength per square inch
should be given by cements of good quality when tested in the manner
recommended in the above-named report:

Much higher results may be obtained from selected brands or from
fairly good brands by having the mortar under pressure while setting: the
development of strength may be hastened by using dryer mortars and
stamping them firmly into the moulds.
Finely ground Portland cement will make stronger mortar when mixed
with sand than the same cement if coarse. The difference is great enough
to be of much practical importance and fine grinding should be required
in all specifications for this class of cements. With natural cements the
evidence in regard to the importance of fine grinding is less conclusive
and it may be doubted whether very fine grinding is desirable unless the
ratio of sand to cement exceeds 2:1.
Mortars of most natural cements are injured if frozen before having
set—particularly if this is followed by repeated freezing and thawing.
Portland cement mortar is injured only slightly if at all. Freezing is re-
tarded or prevented in various ways: the stone, sand and water are some-
times heated but this must be done with great caution for the mortar will
be ruined if overheated. Salt is sometimes added to the water used in
mixing, lowering the freezing point of the mortar, and without injuring its
strength. The resulting efflorescence on the face of the wall may be ob-*
jectionable in appearance on architectural work.


BY MEANS OF MOMENT TABLES.
BY G. B. BOEHM.
The matter contained in this paper is not offered as being by any
means new or original. On the contrary Moment Tables are in very gen-
eral use, and it is for this reason that the following article is written.
Moment Tables are the moments, tabulated for convenience, of any
specified collection of loads, about all necessary points, and from which
by means of very simple computations, the bending moments and shears
in trusses loaded in the same manner may be found. These tables are of
course, particularly applicable in finding the stresses in bridge trusses,
when it is desired to use the actual wheel loads.
The table herewith given shows the wheel loads on one side of an en-
gine and tender, that is, the loads given are those which would be carried
by one truss of a single track bridge, provided, of course, the track is in
the center between trusses.
•m i I* 4ft i

The preparation of the table is an easy affair, being a matter of multi-
plication and addition.
The numbers in the first row are the summations of distances, or, as
marked, the distances of each wheel from the first wheel; those in the
second row are the summations of the weights, or technically, shears;
those in the bottom row are summations of moments, that is each one is
the moment of the preceding loads, about the point under which it is writ-
ten, and they are found in the following manner,—the moment at the first
wheel is of course zero, as there are no weights preceding it; the moment
at the second wheel is 6 (the weight on the first wheel) multiplied by 5/67


SI
and equals 34, as shown; the moment at the third wheel is 12 (shear at
Becond wheel) multiplied by 4/67 and to this product is added 34 (the pre-
ceding moment) giving 90, which is the moment of wheels 1 and 2 about
wheel 3. The moment about wheel 4 is obtained by multiplying 27.7
(shear at wheel 3) by 5/9, and adding to this the previous moment, 90.0
giving 254.0. The table can thus be extended indefinitely, and different
tables can be prepared, one of them showing two or more engines coupled
together and followed by a certain train load, while others may have but
one engine and each a different train load, etc. The wheel loads of the
engine and tender are the only ones worthy of consideration, and the mo-
ments of the uniform (usually so considered) train load can be found in
the same manner as above by considering it concentrated every five or
ten feet.
The application of this table to trusses will now be considered.
Let W = total weight on truss.
L = span.
K = panel length.
N = number of panels.
0 = total moment about last wheel on bridge (see table).
O' = moment about point where shear or bending moment is req'd.
x = distance from last wheel on bridge to back end of bridge,
y ■= distance from front end of bridge to point where moment is
required.
Then

but, there will be weights in front of the point where the shear is required,
and in the same panels, and if
O' = the moment of these weights about the point,
0'

and hence must be subtracted from the reaction to give the shear required
, O + Wx O' , . _ L . 0+ Wx — NO'

The Technic.
If there are any wheels in the panels in front of the one just considered,
their weights must, of course, be subtracted from the reaction.
Equation 2 is as easily proved.
O + Wx
L
= reaction at front end, as before.
O + Wx
Then =-— y = moment of reaction about the point where the moment
is required.
O' is, as before, the moment of the loads in front of the point, and
therefore must be subtracted from the total moment, hence
0 + Wx
Bending moment = ^ y — O'.
Lt
Cases are certain to arise, where one or more of the front wheels will move
off the bridge, when the loads are shifted. When a case of this kind oc-
curs, the moments of these loads, about the back end of the bridge, must
be subtracted from the total moment (O + Wx) before dividing by the
span, L.
In order to find the position of load for maximum shear or bending
moment, the following methods, taken from a paper by Mr. Swain, on
"Stresses in Bridges " in the Trans. Am. Soc. C. E. for July, 1887, are of
very great service.

2—Position of load for maximum bending moment.
The average load per running foot should be, as nearly as possible, the
same on both sides of the section in question, and some load must be at
the section. Also the heaviest loads must be as near the point as possible.
The proof of the first statement is as follows:
„ QO.OfOOO.OO,
Let A B be a beam with span I, loaded in any manner, and let Gi and G2
be the resultant load on either side of the section C, to be considered, then
The moment M at the section = Gi -~ 1- G8 ——j .
If the entire system of loads be moved a distance a to the left, the
moment at C becomes

But ~x = average load per running foot on the right of the section
and — = average load per running foot on the left of the section.
Hence it is seen, that if the average load per running foot on the right of
the section is greater than the average load per running foot on the left of
the section, the bending moment at the section will be increased by mov-
ing the loads to the left, and vice versa.
Further, we shall always be able to place the loads in such a manner
3


The Technic.
upon the bridge, that, with some particular load an infinitely small distance
to the right of the section in question, the average load to the right shall be
greater than that to the left, while for the same load an infinitely small
distance to the left of the section, the average load to the left will be larger.
From this it follows that for the maximum moment at any section, some
load must be at that section.
When there are two or more positions of the load giving nearly the
same average load per running foot on both sides of the section, it will be
necessary to find the moments for all such positions.


BY R. G. MANNING, '90.
The dome as here considered is a roof or covering for a building. A
dome is usually circular or polygonal in plan, and a vertical section
through the axis of the dome may be curved or polygonal, though usually
curved. Domes with a circular or polygonal base and the curve of the
vertical section through the axis an arc of a circle are of most common oc-
currence in practice.
Under this class there are four types of domes, the hemispherical,
the segmental, the Gothic, and the segmental Gothic.
The hemispherical dome is one whose vertical section through the
axis is a semicircle, and whose surface is a hemisphere.
The segmental dome is one whose vertical section through the axis is
a segment of a circle less than a semicircle, and whose surface is a seg-
ment of a sphere less than a hemisphere.
The Gothic dome is one whose vertical section through the axis is
made up of the arcs of two circles, these arcs being equal and symmetri-
cally situated with respect to the axis, and springing vertically from the
wall or abutments. The centres of the two equal arcs are on the same
horizontal line with the springing points.
The segmental Gothic dome is the same as the Gothic except that the
sides do not spring vertically from' the wall. Fig. 5 is a section of a seg-
mental Gothic dome; M and N being the centres of the two arcs B C and
AC respectively, and on the same horizontal'line below the springing
line A B.
The surface of a dome with a circular base may be regarded as a surface
of revolution generated by a curve or other figure revolving about a vertical
axis passing through some point of the curve, the plane of the curve being
vertical, and the point of intersection of the curve and axis being the
highest point, or crown of the dome. If the curve is a quadrant of a circle,
it will generate a hemispherical dome; if less than a quadrant, with its
center in the axis, it will generate a segmental dome; if less than a quad-
rant with its centre outside of the axis and lying on the side of the axis


The Technic.
opposite to that on which the arc lies, it will generate; (1) a Gothic dome
when that centre is in the plane of the base, and (2) a segmental Gothic
dome if that centre is below the plane of the base.
Until'recently nearly all domes of any size, say sixty feet, or more, in
diameter, that have been built, are of masonry construction, and the
mathematical investigation of domes of stone or brick with practical re-
sults can be found in the Proceedings of the Royal Society (London) for
1866, and The Civil Engineer and' Architect's Journal (London) of Febru-
ary 1st and March 1st, 1868, by E. W. Tarn; also in the Memoirs of the
Royal Institute of British Architects, of February, 1871, by Sir Edmund
Beckett (then Mr. Dennison).
This investigation is intended to apply to a ribbed dome with a circu-
lar base, or one in which a roof of suitable material is carried by ribs or
arches springing from the wall or suitable abutments. These ribs should
be symmetrically arranged about the axis of the dome at equal intervals,
each rib carrying an equal amount of the weight of the roof. The number
of ribs will depend upon the material employed and the load to be carried.
The individual ribs may be made continuous from the crown to the
springing, or they may be divided at a desired distance from the crown
into two or more ribs, so as to diminish the length of the purlins near the
springing, to distribute the thrust, which is greatest near the springing,
among a larger number of ribs, and for other purposes, such as to pro-
vide for windows and entrances.
These ribs may be looked upon as a number of similar arches inter-
secting at a common point, the crown of the dome in this case, and it is
evident that the stresses in these ribs could be determined as though each
acted as an independent arch, according to methods to be found in books
on the subject, (see Prof. Greene's Graphics, Part III, Arches). The
action of a load upon a rib, which is not in equilibrium under that load,
tends to make the rib deviate from its original form, and this tendency to
distort the form of the rib sets up a bending moment at each point of the
rib which must be resisted by the moment of resistence of the material of
the rib. Now, if we should unite the several ribs of the dome by hori-
zontal ribs or hoops, we should expect these horizontal ribs, by their re-
sistance to a change in the lengths of their diameters, to tend to keep the
vertical ribs in their original positions. If these horizontal ribs were
placed sufficiently close together, they would take up the change in the
horizontal thrust tending to change the form of the rib and produce in the
vertical rib a direct thrust only. Practically this can be realized without
having to supply a continuous horizontal thrust all along the rib, as theo-


37
retically would be required to do away entirely with the bending moment.
Let ABC, Fig. 1, be any curve, and let it represent a rib of a dome
with a circular base ; the points D and D', E and E', etc., being similarly
situated points on opposite sides of the crown C at which the horizontal
ribs are attached. DD', EE', etc., are projections of the horizontal ribs.
Let the ribs be symmetrically loaded with respect to the crown with a
distributed load. The horizontal ribs connecting D and D', E and E', etc.,
may, for the present, be considered as simply horizontal pieces connecting
the points on opposite sides of the rib. This investigation is based upon
the assumption that this combination of rib and horizontal pieces may be
considered as a truss without bending moments at the points of attach-
ment, A, D, E, etc., of the horizontal pieces.
First, the general formulas for a dome of any figure with a circular
base, and loaded with a distributed load, will be deduced, and, secondly,
those for the most general type of the dome with circular ribs, namely,
the segmental Gothic dome. The formulas relating to any of the other
types of this class of domes can be obtained from those of the segmental
Gothic by the substitution of proper values for certain functions involved.
The curved form of the rib between the points A, D, E, etc., Fig. 1,
is the best suited to carry a distributed load; the equilibrium curve or
polygon for such a load tending to conform more nearly to the curve of
the rib than if the pieces between them were straight. The exact theo-
retical determination of the forces exerted on the horizontal pieces, where
the deflections of the rib and the bending moments at the points of attach-
ment of the horizontal pieces are taken into account, is thought to be in-
determinate. If the vertical ribs were hinged at these points so as to be
free to turn in a vertical plane, the above assumption would be true, and
the results of the following investigation exact. Though the resulting
formulas do not give the exact values of the horizontal forces exerted by
the rib at the points A, D, E, etc., when there are no hinges at those points
the error is very small. An approximation from the results obtained has
been made for a particular case, in which the most unfavorable condition
was assumed, and the error did not exceed 4%. This error is very small
for a possible maximum, and to compensate for this the rib, by the follow-
ing treatment, will be designed for a slightly greater bending moment
than actually exists:
General formulas for the Horizontal Thrust of a Rib of a Dome of Any Curve,
Symmetrically Loaded with Respect to the Crown with
a Distributed Load:
Let ABC, Fig. 1, represent the figure of the rib of a dome, and A, D


E, etc., the points of attachment of the horizontal ribs which are to take
up the horizontal thrust of the vertical ribs.
Let x = the horizontal distance of any point of the rib from C, and
let Ci, c2, ca, etc., represent the horizontal distances of the points A, D,
E, etc., from C; C! = A 0 = one-half of the diameter of the dome at
the springing.
Let y = the vertical distance of any point of the rib and kj, k2, k;),
etc., the vertical distances of the points A, D, E, etc., from C; k, = C O =
the rise of the dome. The coordinates of any point of the rib will then be
x, y, and of the points A, D, E, etc., will be c, k,, c2 kf, ca k.,, etc. Each
rib will carry one-half the load between it and the two adjacent ones, or
an amount equal to the load between the two adjacent ribs.

A -.0 B
Let w = the weight of a small segment of a zone of the dome whose
length is equal to the distance between two consecutive ribs at the point
where w is taken, and whose width is unity measured along the curve; w
may be a variable.
The load on a small arc, ds, of the rib is
wds = w 1 + dx, since d s = ^ 1 + dx.
dx* dx!
Let the shearing force acting on the left of a vertical section, just to
the right of A, D, E, etc., be represented by Pi, P2, P3, etc., respectively;
the shearing force being the sum of the vertical forces on either side of
the section and of opposite signs on the two sides of the section; for if the
vertical forces be summed up on one side of the section, the resultant ver-
tical force will act in one direction, say downwards, and the resultant
vertical force on the other side of the section must act in the opposite di-
rection, or upwards, to produce equilibrium. The forces Pi, P2, P3, etc.,
will be numerically equal to the load on the rib from the crown to the
points A, D, E, etc., but will act in the opposite direction, or upwards.


39
The force, P say, acting upwards on the left of a vertical section at any
point will be equal to the load on the rib from the crown to the section,
and will be expressed by the equation,
P = Xw ^ 1 + ^ dx. .
, o dx1
This expression will give the values of P,, P2, P3, etc., if the limits of in-
tegration o and c,, o and c2, o and c3, etc., be substituted for those of o
and x.
Let the total horizontal forces acting at A, D, E, etc., be represented
by H,, H2, H;i, etc., respectively.
Consider, first, the equilibrium of that part of the rib between A and
D. There is the vertical force Pl acting upwards, and the unknown hori-
zontal force H, acting at the point A and the weight of the load between
A and D acting downwards. Assuming that there is no bending moment
at the point A, D, E, etc., and taking moments about D, we obtain the
equation,

where is the horizontal force at the springing and P! the vertical re-
action.
Next consider the equilibrium of that part of the rib between the
points D and E. There is the vertical force P2, and the horizontal force
H3 acting at the point D, and the downward force of the load between D
and E. Taking moments as before about the point E, we obtain the
equation,

where n represents the number of the point, counting from the springing,

The total horizontal force H2 which was found necessary at the point
D to- produce equilibrium, is made up of two parts; first, the horizontal
force due to the horizontal member at D, and secondly, the horizontal force
already existing in the rib from that supplied at A, so that the force which
must be supplied by the horizontal member at D, is the difference between
H2 and H,. In a similar manner, that to be supplied at E is Ha — H,;
so that the
Horizontal force supplied at A = H,
"D = H2 — H,
"E = H3 — H2
etc. etc. etc.
"nth point = Hn —Hn-,
The horizontal force H, at A may be taken up at the springing by the wall
or abutments, or by a horizontal rib, in a manner similar to that which is
employed at the points D, E, etc.
If the form of the curve of the rib is known, and if w can be expressed
in terms of x, the problem becomes immediately soluble.
The Horizontal Ribs.
Having found the horizontal forces which are required at the points
A, D, E, etc., to keep the rib in its original position, the next consider-
ation is that of finding the stresses in the horizontal ribs by which these
are to be taken up. The dome being symmetrically loaded, each vertical
rib will cause equal horizontal forces at points equidistant from the crown.
A horizontal rib will, therefore, be acted upon by equal normal forces at
points symmetrically arranged about the rib, and equidistant from each
other.
Let ABC, Fig. 2, represent a horizontal rib with equal normal forces,
H acting upon it as stated above. In order that the rib may be properly
designed, the bending moment at all points of the rib must be known.
Since the rib is acted upon by forces symmetrically arranged, maximum
bending moments of one kind will occur at the points where the normal
forces are applied, and the maximum bending moments of the opposite


41
kind will occur half way between those points, and the direction of the rib
at the points of maximum bending moments of either kind will be un-
changed. At the points where the forces are applied the rib tends to
move in the direction of the applied forces, while at the points midway
between them it tends to move in the opposite direction. If we call the
bending moment which tends to make the rib less convex positive, that
which tends to make it more convex will be of the opposite kind, or
negative.
Since the rib is symmetrical with respect to a diameter A B in the
plane of a vertical rib, we may consider the equilibrium of the half above
the diameter A B. The components of the normal forces parallel to A B
can not cause any tangential reactions at A and B, since the rib is acted
upon by equal normal forces at points symmetrically situated with respect
to the diameter A B. Therefore, the tangential force in the rib at A or B
is one-half of the components, perpendicular to A B, of the normal forces
which act above that diameter; one-half being resisted at each of the
points. Since the rib is in perfect equilibrium with the forces, H acting
upon it, the force at A or B, parallel to the diameter caused by the forces
at the other points, must exactly balance the force H at A or B. There-
fore, the force at A or B, acting in the direction of A B caused by the
forces actingon the half rib above A B will be one-half H. Knowing the
tangential and normal forces at the points A and B, there remains to be
found the bending moment at the point A or B; this being known, the
bending moment at any other point between A and the next point of ap-
plication of a force, as K, can be found. The bending moments, shears,
and direct thrusts in the rib repeat themselves in each segment of the
4


The Technic.
rib between two adjacent normal forces, and what is true of one segment is
true of any other.
The bending moment at any section of the rib, which must be re-
sisted by the moment of resistance of the material of the rib at that sec-
tion, tends to change tbe direction of the rib at that point and the change
of inclination at any point is directly proportional to the bending moment
at that point and inversely proportional to the modulus of elasticity of the
material and the moment of inertia of the cross section of the rib at that
point. If the modulus of elasticity is constant and the cross section of
the rib uniform we shall have to concern ourselves with the bending
moment only. Since now we may say that the change of inclination at
any point is proportional to the bending moment at that point, the total
change of inclination between any two points will be proportional to the
sum of the bending moments between those points.
Let ABC, Fig. 1, represent the half rib under consideration;
A 0 = r, the radius of the rib;
0, = the angle between the directions of two adjacent normal
forces;
&lt;j&gt; = the angle between the diameter A B and any radius O E;
M0 = the bending moment at A = bending moment at any
point where a normal force is applied;
M = the bending moment at any point E;
K be the point of application of the force adjacent to A;
EDisa perpendicular from E on A B.
The tangential force at A or B = % j H sin &lt;p, + U sin 2 &lt;t&gt;, + Hsiu
3 &lt;j&gt;, + etc. + . . . H sin n (j&gt;, | where n is the number of normal forces
acting on one side of the diameter A B. Let this expression be repre-
sented by — 2 sin (/) Vi, where (/) represents the function 1, 2, 3, etc.,
of &lt;t&gt;, and 2 represents that the sum of all such terms as sin (/) &lt;pt is to
be taken. The normal force at A or B is one half H. Then the bending
moment, M, at any point between A and K will be given by the equation,
M = M„ + 5- D E - 2- A D 2 sin (/)
and the change of inclination at the point E will be proportional to this
bending moment. Since the direction of the rib at the points of applica-
tion of the normal forces and at the points midway between them is un-
changed, the total change of inclination between those points must be
zero. Therefore if we sum up the bending moments between those points


43
and place this sum equal to zero we will get an equation involving the
unknown bending moment M0. The equation for finding M0, if we take
the sum of the bending moments between A and K, is,

Direct Thrust and Shear in the Horizontal Rib.
To aid us in deducing the mathematical expression for the direct
thrust and shear at any point, draw the stress diagram, Fig. 3, for the
half rib A B C of Fig. 2. Lay off the polygon of external forces, begin-
ning at b with a line b 1 parallel and equal to the force O L, then draw 1 e
and c k parallel to O C and 0 K respectively and equal to the first line
b 1. Then draw k a parallel to the tangent at A'tlnd equal to H 2 sin ( /) q&gt;,,
then a o parallel to 0 A and equal to one-half H for the tangential and
normal forces at A required to keep the rib in equilibrium; then complete
the polygon by drawing o a and a b for the forces at B. The point a bi-
sects the line k b. From o draw o k, o c, o 1 and o b, which represent in
direction and magnitude the resultant of the external forces acting on the
rib. From o draw a line o e parallel to the tangent at any point S of the
rib, the radius at that point making an angle &lt;t&gt; with the diameter A B.
Drop a perpendicular from k on the line o e, then will o e be the direct
thrust and k e the normal shear at the point E.
The angle between the lines o k and a e is 9 — % &lt;p,.
Let T = o e = the direct thrust at the point M;
S = k e = shear at the point E;
R = ok = the resultant force in the rib;

Equations (7) and (8) give the direct thrust and normal shear at any

for the direct thrust and shear,
T = 5 | sin 0 + cos &lt;p 2 sin (/) j- (7a)

Direct Thrust, Shear and Bending Moment in the Vertical Rib.
Lay off the load line a c, Fig. 4, corresponding to the load on one half
of the rib ABC, Fig. 1, beginning with the load at the springing A
and ending at the crown C so that c would be the middle point of the

whole load line if completed. Take any point S on the rib, Fig. 1, and
from c, Fig. 4, draw c o equal to the total horizontal force in the rib at
that point = the sum of the horizontal forces supplied by the horizontal
ribs below the point S. From o draw o m parallel to a tangent to the rib
at the point S. Let c s = P = the load on the rib above the point S.
Draw m s and c p perpendicular to o m and s n perpendicular to c p, then
will o m be the direct thrust and s m the normal shear in the rib at the
point S.
Let T = o m = the direct thrust at S;
S = m s = " normal shear at S;
H = o c = " horizontal force in the rib at S;
f&gt; = the angle c o m = the angle pcs = the angle the tangent at
S makes with the horizontal.
Then,
T = o p + p m = o p + s n = H cos 6 + P sin 8; (9)
S = 8 m = c p — e n = H sin 0 — P cos 6 ■ (10)
Though the bending moment in the vertical rib will be small if the
horizontal ribs are placed reasonably near each other, it may be taken
into account by the following formula. Assuming that the maximum
bending moment occurs at the middle point of the rib between two adja-
cent horizontal ribs (which is sufficiently exact for most cases) we obtain
the bending moment by the following equation,
M = Pn_1(Cn_1-xn)-Hn_1(kn_1 _ yn)
w%/i + ll! U-C^jjdx (11)
x d X*
n
where xn, yn are the coordinates of the middle point of the arc between
the nth and the (n — l)th horizontal rib.
If a more exact result is desired put for y in the equation above its
value in terms of x from the equation of the curve, differentiate with
respect to x put the first differential coefficient equal to zero and solve for
the value of x that will make M a maximum.
The Segmental Gothic Dome.
Let ABC, Fig. 5, represent a vertical section of a rib of a segmental
Gothic dome; the horizontal lines at A, D, E, etc., being projections of
the horizontal ribs. M~ and N are the centres of the arcs B C and A C,
C 0 the axis and A B the springing line of the dome.


47
Let a = the angle between the axis, or vertical through N, and the
radius N 0;
p = the angle between the vertical through N and the radius
N A at the springing;
0 = the angle between the vertical through N and any radius;
0u 0s&gt; Qi&gt; etc., = the angles between the vertical and radii to the
points A, D, E, etc.; 8l = P;
&lt;Pi = the angle between two adjacent vertical ribs;
R = radius of the arc of the dome;
r = radius of the dome at the springing;
d s = an element of the arc of the vertical rib;
d s' = an element of an arc in a horizontal section at any point S;
d m = an element of the area of the dome.
Then d m = d s d s'.
d s = R d 0; ds' = xd0 = R (sin 6 — sin a) d &lt;f.
The area of a segment of a zone of the dome whose width is d s and
whose length is the distance between two adjacent ribs will be,

Let the load be uniformly distributed, w being the intensity of the

load and W the load on a unit length of the rib. Then the load on an arc
d s of the rib will be,
W d s = w R &lt;j&gt;, (sin 8 — sin a) d s
= w R2 fi (sin 8 — sin a) d 8.
As in the general treatment, let P be the load on the rib above any
point S and P,, P3, P3, etc., the load above the points A, D, E, etc. Let
H,, H3, H3, etc., be the total horizontal forces in the rib at the points A,
D, E, etc.
Let C, the crown of the dome, be the origin of co-ordinates and let
x, y, be the co-ordinates of any point on the rib and c^k, ; c3, k3; c3, k3;
etc., the co-ordinates of the points A, D, E, etc. The load on the rib be-
tween the crown and any point S will be given by the equation,
P =

W d s = w

(sin 8 — sin a) d 8,
or P = w R2 (cos a + a sin a — cos 8 — 8 sin a) (12)

in the general treatment, we have the equation,

The horizontal force to be supplied at A, either by the wall or a hori-
zontal rib is H, ; at D it is H2 — H, ; at E it is H;, — H2, and so on for
the other points as in the case of the general treatment. The formula
above is applicable to either the Gothic or the segmental Gothic dome.
The discussion of the horizontal rib, direct thrust and shear previ-
ously given is applicable to this class of domes without modification.
The bending moment at any point between the nth and the (n — l)th
horizontal rib will be,
M = Pn_! R (sin 0a_l — sin 8) — Hn_1 R (cos ft — cos 9n_l) —

The bending moment at the middle point of the arc may be taken as
a maximum value or the expression may be differented with respect to 8
and solved for the value of 8 that makes M a 'maximum as before. The
point of maximum bending moment may be found sufficiently close by
one or two approximations, assuming different values for 8 and calculat-
ing M.
The Cupola.
A dome is usually mounted with a cupola or lantern, which is a
smaller dome placed on the top of the dome proper for the purpose of ad-
mitting light and for architectural effect. In some types of dome it is
said to increase the stability of the larger dome. The Congressional Li-
brary Building, which is to be built at Washington, will have a dome
about 90 feet in diameter and the dome will have a cupola about 35 feet in
diameter.
To consider the effect of this additional weight near the crown of the
dome, let W = the weight of the entire cupola and X the number of ribs

supporting the cupola. The vertical reaction at the springing of each rib
W
will be 2&gt;^. Taking moments about the point D, as before, we have,

MINING IN GENERAL, TREATED AS A LEGITIMATE
BUSINESS TO BE DIVESTED OF ITS WILD-
CAT REPUTATION.
BY P. C. SMITH.
While the subject of mining has scarcely a passing interest for very
many persons who have never engaged in it, it is probable that, even
in the minds of such persons, it is ticketed with the label "hazardous
business," and it is probably even farther condemned by persons who
have invested in mines and lost. It is, however, a business of
such magnitude and importance, and has been of such constantly increas-
ing moment ever since the days' of Tubal Cain, that an apology for this
attempt to rid a noble profession of unmerited reproach will scarcely be
necessary.
In dealing with the subject of mining it will be well to include the
consideration of the allied science of metallurgy, since, in probably the
majority of cases which have to do with mining, at least of the pre-
cious metals, it is an absolute necessity that the mining engineer should be
acquainted with their metallurgy.
At an early stage in the consideration of our subject a question which
is of prime importance naturally arises: i. e., is a practical education
alone sufficient to enable a man to deal understandingly and safely with
the problems in mining and metallurgy whose solution would go far to
rid the business of its uncertain and risky reputation? This question un-
doubtedly occurs to many persons, who, from a wrong consideration of
the same, cause themselves and other people to suffer loss both in money
and in confidence in the legitimacy of mining as a business.
As an example of the mistaken idea imbibed by many people as to
the value of education per se, I will quote from a letter lately received
from a Wisconsin-business man of considerable prominence:
'There is a reaction going on leading to a more practical education;
'—such an education, in fact, as can be acquired at very few colleges.
'A thorough college course carries a man past the age when he is
'willing to learn the rudiments of business. College bred men are of lit-


53
'tie account in the business world to-day. In this city of thirty thousand
'people there is not one successful business man who has ever taken a
'thorough course of study.'
Such ideas may be worthy of notice if confined in their application
to industrial and commercial pursuits; but, to quote from Mr. An-
drew Carnegie, who, in a late article, referred to in the Engineering
and Mining Journal, says: 'Exactly the opposite state of affairs
'seems to exist in the case of graduates of the technical and scientific
'schools. Three of the largest steel manufacturing concerns in the world
'are already under the management of three young educated men, and
'most of the chiefs of departments under them are men of the same class.
'Such young men have one important advantage over the apprenticed me-
• chanic, they are open-minded and without prejudice.'
It might be said that the ideas of such men as the one first quoted
above are evidently so narrow and incorrect as to be of no moment—that
such a man is disqualified, by lack of proper education and experience,
from giving weighty judgment upon such a matter; but it is an unfortunate
fact that such men as these are frequently the promoters of mining enter-
prises, and are the very ones, in particular, whom we wish to convince
that something more than a practical knowledge is necessary to the min-
ing engineer in order that, as a direct result, the business of mining may
come to be generally safe, and may be so considered. These are the men,
I repeat, whose knowledge of the subject of the correct handling of mines
we wish to improve, since they are the ones who, upon meeting with ex-
pensive failures in mining, overlook their own 'inefficiency of judgment
and loudly condemn the business.
It is probable that no other business of such an extent as mining offers
a tithe of the inducement and opportunity to unscrupulous persons for
swindling operations, and few other kinds of legitimate business offer to
the investor that pleasing possibility of unheard-of profit. It would seem
that every one, male or female, has a greater or less share of curiosity,
cupidity and gambling instinct as a birthright, and this we see gratified
through various stages, harmless and excessive, from the grab-bag of the
old-time church social or fair, through the various forms of auctions and
lottery schemes, to the unorthodox and unlawful open gambling. Mining
caters to these unfortunate instincts by furnishing us with a seductive ele-
ment of chance, and our lack of knowledge concerning the extreme intri-
cacy of the business leads us to invest our money upon the representations
of some one who may know no more about mining than we do ourselves.
When we have lost our money and resolve, either mentally or orally, never


The Technic.
to be fooled again, we do not consider that we have been at the mercy of
incapable persons or swindlers, or both.
Cases similar to the following are of frequent occurrence : The Mentor
gold mine or prospect is bought and a company is formed. The chief
owner is an honest gentleman who has made his money in ordinary com-
mercial pursuits. He induces his friends to become interested by the evi-
dence of assays from various parts of the surface of the ore deposit and
from such depth as may have been reached. The company proceed to
select some trustworthy man to superintend the operation of the mine and
to erect a mill for the treatment of their ore. They decide upon a man
who is a carpenter and millwright by trade, a thoroughly capable man in
his line, and possibly related to the promoter of the company. This man,
full of honest zeal, departs for the mine, which may be the first one he
has ever seen. At the most convenient trade-center he shows samples of
his ore to some manufacturers of mill machinery, and is generally told
that he should have a battery of stamps besides a crusher and rolls to pul-
verize the ore, that he should amalgamate all the free gold on copper
plates and save the slimes on rotary buddies, also, that in consideration of
the iron and copper pyrites present he must provide the mill with a set of
sizing screens and a set of jigs, in order to concentrate the more refractor}-
ores, and that the tailings from his jigs may be further worked in his
stamps and on the buddies. He drives a close bargain for all this machin-
ery and purchases his lumber and iron necessary for construction at such
low figures that the company are well assured of his general ability. He
also secures good freight rates to the mine, and in a few months erects a
mill at less cost than the company could reasonably expect. In the mean-
time the miners have been getting out ore under his direction. Suppose
that the surface of the ore-deposit is weathered and oxidized to the condi-
tion of a free milling ore, while further down the ore becomes gradually
more refractory, as is generally the case. Our superintendent treats all the
surface ore in a few weeks, by stamping and direct amalgamation on cop-
per plates, and produces some bullion. He now commences work with
his entire plant by crushing and sizing the sulphide ores, concentrating
the same in his jigs and working over the tailings in his stamps and bud-
dies. So far so good. The ore upon which the mill is now running is re-
ported by the assayer at the mine to be of lower grade than the surface
ore, but for this the superintendent can see no reason; in fact he has been
told that fissure veins increase both in richness and size as they go down-
ward; so he has a sample of the ore assayed by a custom assayer, who
uses shot instead of granulated lead in making his assay, and who reports


55
considerably more precious metal than the assayer at the mine, the excess
being principally in silver. This agrees so very closely with the hope
of the superintendent that he continues his mill-run and turns out several
car-loads of beautiful concentrates. During this time the expenses have
been crawling upward at a rapid pace, and the mine assayer reports the
ore to be getting even poorer still, also that he cannot discover much
precious metal even in the concentrates. The superintendent, however,
is convinced that, as his assay of the ore was once proved incorrect by an
outside check, it is apt to be so still; so he tells the assayer that the ore is
pretty difficult to assay, but to keep at it and he will be able to assay some
day. The lot of concentrates is shipped, say to the Hill Smelter at Argo,
Colorado, and upon receipt of the returns, it is found that, after allowing
95 per cent of the assay value of the precious metals, and $2 per unit for
the copper present, and deducting the smelting charges and freight charges,
the profit to the mine on seven car-loads of concentrates is minus $6.50,
and to this must be added the cost of transportation from the mine to the
railroad, and also the mine and mill expenses in producing the concen-
trates. The company have been assessed steadily to meet the expenses
of getting the mill under operation, and the report of this last decisive
transaction is too much for them. Their stock certificates are laid away
in some dark corner and, when, at some future time, some one proposes an
investment in mines to a member of the Mentor Co., these certificates are
produced as monumental evidence of the truth of their owner's conclusion;
i. e., "My friend, I've been there! I invested in the Mentor mine, which
was capably and honestly worked, and I lost every cent I put into it. It's
all luck, and I don't care to try it again."
It is only necessary to say that, if the Mentor property had been prop-
erly explored and valued, by a capable mining engineer, previous to the
building of the mill, he would have advised the company either to
drop the whole thing, or to erect only a small, portable plant which might
treat the surface ores at a small profit.
Cases of the above nature, where much better ores may have been
mined and treated and worse results, as to profit, obtained, are exceedingly
numerous, and cause obstinate prejudices in the minds of people who have
suffered by investment.
Having dealt with the factor of incapable management, it may be well
to refer to the other unfortunate factor which multiplies the prejudice
against mining; i. e., misrepresentation and swindling.
To consider the various methods used in booming mines and districts,
and in selling worthless stocks to unsuspicious persons, would take several


The Technic.
volumes, and, as we have all, doubtless, heard more or less of such tran-
sactions, a discussion of them will scarcely be necessary; nor do they
strictly concern us in the consideration of the question, since technical
education does not necessarily improve the morals, and we have mining
engineers of ability who are undoubtedly dishonest. With people who
are disposed to buy mining stocks as a venture, with the idea of taking
advantage of a slight rise in value, and with stock gamblers in general, we
have nothing to do; but to those who go into mining as a legitimate enter-
prise and invest their money as they would in a manufacturing concern,
the following advice is salutary: Do not place yourselves at the mercy of
people who, even if capable, may possibly be dishonest.
I have before me the prospectus, dated 1887, of an Iron Mining
Company, setting forth the brilliant prospects of a certain alleged
mine, with a pleasing map of the property, and a promising report
upon the same; over the name of a capable mining engineer, and
the whole thing is a fraud. I have been personally familiar with the dis-
trict in which the property was located, and with the property itself, and
was reasonably certain that not one pound of iron ore would ever be
shipped from it. There never has been.
But to leave the unpleasant subject of the dishonest use of ability,
which is something all have, naturally, to guard against, we will consider
the proper mode of entrance into the business of mining; a system which,
if followed as a rule, would reduce that business to the plane of legitimate
commercial pursuits, and remove from it to a great extent, its element of
uncertainty. We will omit the consideration of the mining of iron or coal,
since the reduction of iron ores seldom falls to the lot of the engineer who
mines them, and, as for coal, it offers no problem to the metallurgist; but
we will take up the consideration of deposits containing gold and silver
with associated metals, since such ores are of greater diversity of charac-
ter, and offer more intricate problems for solution. Such ones, further-
more, although capable of yielding profit when properly worked, have, for
the reasons first stated, more frequently brought the discredit upon mining
which we wish to remove.
As a preliminary step, the deposit of ore should be visited, in per-
son, by a capable engineer, and should be accurately sampled at as
many different points as can be reached ; these samples should be assayed
and the mineralogical character of the ore ascertained as nearly as possi-
ble. The deposit should be measured in its three dimensions to as great
au extent and as accurately as possible; on the surface by the most care-
ful examinations, and below the surface by the use of such borings and


57
test pits as are possible, and the apparent value of the deposit will war-
rant. By borings or other possible means the character of the ore below
the surface and below the water line should be ascertained as nearly as
possible. The character of the country-rock should be examined; also
the earth overlying the deposit, and the probable difficulty to be encoun-
tered from water carefully noted. Very careful examinations should be
made of neighboring ore-deposits, if there are any such which have been
opened up to any extent, in order that all local characteristics of the ore-
bearing strata and the ore deposits themselves may be noted for compari-
son. These data, determined with respect to the probable approximate
value of the deposit and the proper mode of mining to be adopted,
may be supplemented or preceded by the collection of data necessary in
view of the future metallurgical treatment of the ores. The climate of the
country should be ascertained, the rainfall and the available water sup-
ply, the condition of the roads, if any, and the distance to, and means of ar-
rival at shipping points, either by railroad or by water, the amount of
timber obtainable for construction and for* fuel, the amount and cost of
other fuel if any, the amount of other ores which may be purchased in the
neighborhood, with as close a determination as possible of the probable
life of such other deposits and their mineralogical character, finally, the
availability of deposits of limestone and of iron and copper-bearing ores.
After the collection of such data, the engineer is in shape to determine "up-
on a process for the treatment of the ore, and here, very probably, the
practical, uneducated miner would fail unless luck favored him, even sup-
posing him possessed of all the data just enumerated; for his experience
in the treatment of ores must be, of necessity, limited to a knowledge of a
very few methods and of a very few kinds of ore, and, even if he
meets one of his old, familiar ores, the surrounding conditions of the dis-
trict may be so different from those of the district where he had seen the
similar ore successfully treated as to render the old process comparatively
the wrong one, or even totally unavailable. He would either try his pet
process, for such men generally have one, or else place himself at the
mercy of new process hawkers, whose only object is the sale of their ma-
chinery.
In the selection of a process for the metallurgical treatment of the ore,
the engineer is generally called upon to determine the method which
will yield the greatest net profit per ton of ore; although, in certain cases,
another method may be preferable, if, for instance, the former necessitates
the erection of a much larger and more expensive plant; in which
case the greater intricacy of such a plant and the greater responsibility


The Technic.
resting upon its manager, may render the less profitable method prefer-
able.
If there be either a custom mill or smelter in the neighborhood of
our mine, it is very probable that our ore would find its way there. If
not, we must consider the treatment of the ore, either entirely or in part,
at the mine, and we come to the consideration of the various processes.
A smelting with lead, if there be 15 to 20 per cent, of that metal in the
ore, or to be obtained near at hand, is probably of wider application than
other processes, and gives as close returns. A concentration to a copper
matte might be even more desirable if the ore contained some copper. A
concentration of ore, if of low grade, by smelting to an iron matte, might
be applied if iron pyrites could be obtained together with a small amount
of lead. A simple mechanical concentration might be used, by means of jigs
and rotary buddies or Frue vanners, if the character of the ore did not
necessitate too fine a crushing, or did not, by its sectility, produce slimes.
The ore might be stamped, either roasted or raw, amalgamated in pans
or on copper plates, with mercury, and the tailings concentrated. The
roasted or raw ore might be successfully treated by some process of leach-
ing with hyposulphite solutions and concentration of the tailings. In
Mexico the patio process is undoubtedly adapted to the peculiar climatic
conditions of the country, and although apparently wasteful and expensive,
is largely used in the treatment of free and refractory silver ores.
Having this list of methods in general use, one or more of which would
undoubtedly save the precious metals in our ores, the question arises,
which one shall we adopt? The practical man would probably, and very
naturally say—"of all the applicable methods take the cheapest," mean-
ing either the method which would extract the precious metals at the least
cost per ton, or, the method which would reduce the ore and, at the same
time, necessitate the least initial expenditure for a plant of machin-
ery. The engineer would say nothing of the sort, for the simple reason
that the most advantageous method would be dependent strictly upon the
local conditions, and cases are not impossible or unheard of where, of the
several applicable methods, in the abstract, the one yielding the least net
gain per ton of ore, or the one necessitating the greatest initial outlay for
the plant, would be the most desirable to adopt. Furthermore, it is gener-
ally the case that a combination of two or more methods of treatment have
to be used, and it is often advisable that the ore should receive only a par-
tial reduction at the mine. It is in the consideration of the relative value
of the various methods and combinations of the same, under the peculiar
local conditions, that the engineer finds a necessity for the most able and


59
careful work, and it is evident that he should have a thorough technical
knowledge of the methods in general use, and be able to discriminate as
to the efficiency of the various mechanical devices upon the market—
such as concentrators, pulverizers, &amp;c, &amp;c.—in the description of
which the manufacturers almost always claim more than is possible and
omit the consideration of points vital in particular cases.
In proof of the assertion that such a careful consideration of the local
conditions is a necessary preliminary to the adoption of a method, let us
consider an abstract case and, for the benefit of the skeptic, let me add
that the case has a perfect parallel in our own State of Michigan. The
ore-vein or deposit is declared, by some one, to be a true fissure. It is
known to be of great richness as far as it has been explored. This much
is accepted as fact by the company, without further consideration, proba-
bly because no individual member can prove to the contrary, and because
it coincides so fully with the general hope and desire. They erect smelt-
ing works of the most modern type and most expensive construction, and
treat their ore, for a comparatively short time yielding large dividends.
The so-called fissure vein proves to be a pocket from which no more ore
can be obtained, and the smelter, being situated in a district non-product-
ive of other smelting ores, is shut down and is a dead loss to the company.
Suppose the mine in question had been of average richness, and had only
produced enough ore to pay for the expenses of its mining, the erection of
the smelter and the ore-treatment; or, suppose it did not produce quite
enough to cover these expenses—in either case the result would have been
a loud cry against mining enterprise in general.
It will be readily granted that cases of loss in mining are numerous.
It is no less true than conditions occur, affecting the nature, life and con-
sequent value of ore-deposits, which are beyond the ken of the most thor-
ough and competent engineer. Geological impossibilities or paradoxes do
occur; but, if the study which has gone on for centuries, of the actual
condition of things, and which has been condensed and formulated for the
benefit of the educated engineer, is worth anything at all as compared
with the conclusions reached in a part of one lifetime, it is undoubtedly
true that, if the management of mining operations were placed in the
hands of educated engineers, instead of men whose ability rests only on
their individual experience, while we might not be always certain of suc-
cess, the chances for failure would most certainly be diminished.
If this discussion was taken up for the sole benefit of mining engineers
and metallurgists, many interesting problems might be considered in re-
gard to the exploitation and subsequent treatment of the ores of the pre-


Thb Technic.
cious metals; but, as the consideration of technical problems and solu-
tions to the same, might offend the eye of those who are not directly in-
terested in such discussions, this article is allowed to go forth, to be read
and understood by any who will, with the hope that it may assist to place
the business of mining on its proper hasis as a legitimate enterprise.


Laboratory Work in Engineering.
The Engineering Laboratory comprises the Mechanical Laboratory,
the Iron Room, the Wood Room, the Forge Room, the Foundry, a
Draughting Room, an Engine Room, a Wash Room, and Store Rooms.
The object of this laboratory is to afford opportunities for original in-
vestigations, to make tests of various kinds, to give instruction on the
methods of conducting tests, and to instruct in the practical application-
of tools and materials to engineering purposes.
The present equipment of the various departments is as follows:
Mechanical Laboratory :—This laboratory contains a 25 H. P.
Lansing high speed engine fitted with an "automtic shaft governor, also
a throttling governor arranged for experimental work; a 50 H. P. Reynolds
corliss engine which furnishes power to entire laboratory, is also
arranged for testing. Steam is furnished from a battery of boilers in a
separate building; these boilers may, when desired, be used for testing. A
40 H. P. Wheeler surface condenser is connected with both engines, and
is so arranged as to condense the steam from the engines running either
non-condensing or condensing; a direct acting Blake air-pump exhausts
the condenser when the engines are operated as condensing engines.
A Gordon duplex, a Blake, and a Marsh, boiler feed pump are con-
nected with the condenser, and are arranged for conducting tests to de-
termine their efficiencies. A Worthington duplex pump, an Aguapult
pump and several forms of injectors are available for the same purpose. A
cistern of 150 bbls. capacity just outside the laboratory, and an iron tank
of 100 bbls. capacity placed in a tower at an elevation of 80 feet, serve to
complete the arrangements for pump and injector tests. A Rider com-
pression hot air engine, and an Otto gas engine (in adjoining laboratory),
are also available for experimental work.
A complete Westinghouse air brake, including pump, is mounted for
convenient operation, and affords opportunity for experiments with com-
pressed air. Sturtevant and Buffalo blowers afford further opportuni-
ties for work on air.


The Technic.
An 18-inch Pelton and a 12-inch Tuerk water motor, a small turbine
and hydraulic elevators serve for experiments on hydraulic machinery.
An Iugersoll rock drill, fitted with indicator attachments, may be
tested with steam.
The laboratory is provided with a 10 H. P. Webber transmitting
dynamometer, a 25 H. P. absorbing dynamometer, Prony brake and rope
brakes for the measurement of power.
Several forms of calorimeters, including the Barrus superheating and
the Barrus universal calorimeters serve in determining the quality of
steam.
The laboratory possesses a pair each of the Thompson, the Crosby, and
the Tabor indicators with a full complement of springs, pantographs, lazy
tongs and Brumbo pulleys, an Amsler polar planimeter and two Coffin
averaging instruments, besides special apparatus for testing indicator
springs.
The laboratory is further equipped with two dozen of Green's ther-
mometers, including three standards, ten cased thermometers for steam
and water, besides a number by other makers, also special thermometers
and pyrometers for measuring the temperature of flue gases; one dozen
pressure gauges, including four standards by different makers, five vacuum
gauges, two combination vacuum and pressure gauges, and two Edson
recording gauges, one of which was made to order for special work, a
standard square inch and several test pumps; a Green barometer, an
aneroid barometer, hygrometer, and two anemometers; four platform
scales of from 200 to 2,000 lbs. capacity, two of which are special with
triple beams and graduated to one fiftieth pounds, several spring balances,
and two U. S. standard test weights; a tachometer, two revolution
counters and several speed indicators; an Elliot apparatus for analysis of
flue gases; and an Alliance pulley balancing machine.
In the near future there will be provided a clock beating seconds with
electric attachment, chronographs for determining speed variations, a
Morin and a cradle dynamometer, an open mercury column, a boiler to
carry 200 lbs. pressure for special work in steam engineering, oil testing
machines, and a quantity of other apparatus for use in special lines of
investigation.
In addition to the laboratory equipment the Knowles and the Gordon
pumping engines at the city water works have been specially arranged
by the manufacturers for convenience in making duty trials, and the
engines and boilers at the various mills and factories in this and adjoining
cities are accessible for testing M'ork.


Iron Room:—The Iron Room contains eight engine lathes ranging
from 14-inch swing 5-foot bed to 30-inch swing 23-foot bed, two speed
lathes, two planers, one shaper, one drill press, one boring mill, one
universal milling machine with gear cutting attachment and full comple-
ment of mills and cutters, two emery wheels, one lathe grinding attach-
ment, and grindstone, besides a number of vises and a well equipped tool
room.
Wood Room :—The Wood Room contains 18 benches with separate sets
of tools, a planer, a slitting saw, a combination pattern maker's saw-bench,
a band saw, a jig saw, a mortising machine, a moulding machine, six
lathes, including one chucking lathe, a grindstone, and a full assortment
of special tools.
Forge Room :—The Forge Room contains twelve forges with anvils and
complete sets of tools, one drill press, one Sturtevant blower and one ex-
haust fan.
Foundry :—The Foundry contains two cupolas, two brass furnaces,
a core oven, a hydraulic elevator, a Sturtevant blower and a moulding
floor30 feet square, and a full assortment of flasks.
Draughting Room :—The Draughting Room contains tables for twenty
students, and a separate blue-printing room.
Each department is under the supervision of special instructors who
direct the students' work in all stages of progress.
THE ELECTRICAL LABORATORY.
The electrical portion of the electrical engineering begins with a course
of illustrated lectures in electricity and magnetism, which serves as a
foundation for a subsequent laboratory course in electrical measurements.
This practical work is accompanied by lectures on units and the most
modern and approved methods of making measurements of the various
electrical and magnetic quantities, together with methods of calibrating
the instruments and finding their constants.
During the past year a good deal of work has been done in the syste-
matic testing of batteries, obtaining their polarization and recovery curves,
curves of current, internal resistance, and terminal electro motive force.
This course is followed by one in dynamo-electric machinery, two
hours a week being devoted to class work, and two days to making tests
of dynamos. The laboratory is now provided with two constant potential,
and two constant current dynamos, the latter of ten to twelve lamps
capacity each. A storage battery, 50 incandescent lamps, 16 arc lights,
an iron resistance of 120 ohms, capable of carrying about 15 amperes, and


The Technic.
provided with a switch board which allows of ready coupling in parallel so
as to carry 300 ampires, together with ammeters and voltmeters of
sufficient capacity, permit of making elaborate tests on dynamo machines.
During the year characteristic curves have been obtained of the several
dynamos, tests of efficiency have been made, and a small dynamo has
been " compounded" for constant potential. Motor tests for efficiency have
also been carried out.
A course in Mascart and Joubert's electricity and magnetism is offered
as advanced work, and a course in distribution of electricity and photome-
try of incandescent lamps is required of electrical engineers. The pho-
tometric room is provided with an accurately graduated bar six meters
long, made by Darling, Brown, and Sharp, and has a methoen screen and
an excellent rotating stand for measurement of spherical candle power.
Important work on fuse wires, batteries, incandescent lamps, standard
cells and other standards is also in progress. The entire basement floor is
devoted to the electrical work. The largest room, devoted to the engine
and dynamos, is shown in the engraving. The smaller work rooms are all
provided with substantial stone capped piers. In them apparatus has
been placed for the most accurate work in electrical measurements and in-
vestigations. A portion of the building, remote from the dynamos, has
been kept reasonably free from iron, so as to permit of measuring the hor-
izontal component of terrestrial magnetism. A large tangent and cosine
galvanometer, made by Edelmann, of Munich, is placed in this part of the
building. Only the best apparatus has been obtained; and additions will
be made to meet the rapidly growing demand, occasioned by the great in-
crease of students desiring to avail themselves of the new facilities in this
direction.
THE CHEMICAL LABORATOBY.
The courses in the Chemical Laboratory, arranged for the use of stu-
dents in metallurgy are as follows: Course 1, in Qualitative Analytical
Chemistry, consisting of recitations and laboratory work daily throughout
one semester, with opportunity for advanced work if desired; courses 4, 6,
and 7 in Quantitative Analytical Chemistry; course 4 consisting of a ten
weeks drill, by means of lectures and laboratory work, in elementary
quantitative analysis, and courses 6 and 7 consisting of laboratory work
daily, throughout the entire semester, in the most approved methods of
analysis of a large number of ores, fluxes and furnace products in general.
Course 5 in advanced general quantitative work may be taken if desired,
and is of the same extent as the last two courses mentioned. Blowpipe


Analysis consists of a six weeks course, by means of lectures and labora-
tory work, and includes the identification of one hundred minerals. The
course in Assaying in the dry way is also a six weeks course, and includes
the report of actual assays, for silver and gold, of about twenty-five ores
and furnace products, and the assay of a variety of ores for lead, tin, etc.
There is abundant table room in the laboratory for students in analytical
chemistry, and blowpipe analysis. The quantitative room is provided
with a large hot-plate and steam coil under a hood; also with a steam
bath of ample capacity and fifteen Becker balances for the sole use of stu-
dents. A new Assay furnace has been lately built, having eight muffles
of different sizes, and there are two crucible furnaces of fair capacity. For
the use of students in assaying there is a very delicate assay-balance.
Two courses in Metallurgy are given consisting of two lectures per
week, during one semester, for each course.
The courses are illustrated, as well as possible, by means of charts
and drawings, and, during the past year, an additional course of ten

The extensive use of alternating electric currents in the transmission
of energy for the purpose of lighting and, to a limited extent, for power
necessitates a more general and exhaustive study of their action than for-
merly. Alternating current dynamos were early in the field, but their im-
portance was not fully apprehended till after direct current apparatus had
come into very extensive use,—not in fact till transmission at high voltages
for incandescent lighting was made possible by the application to alternate
current circuits of the inverted induction coil, called a transformer or conr
verter. Since then alternate current apparatus has come rapidly to the
front, and many eager investigators have made brilliant applications of it
to practical purposes.
The phenomena of alternating currents are so totally different from
those of direct currents that the electrician, whose concepts touching
electrical action have been largely derived from the application of Ohm's
law, finds himself entirely unable to comprehend alternate current work-
ing till his views have been modified by an attentive consideration of
many new and perplexing facts.
The first of these facts is self-induction, which plays no part in direct
current working, except on closing or opening the circuit, but which is
exalted to a plane of prime importance with alternating currents. It is to
Professor Joseph Henry that we owe the first clear apprehension and lucid
explanation of this interesting phenomenon.
When a simple periodic E. M. F. is applied to a circuit so disposed
that its different parts act inductively on one another, then this E. M. F.
does work, not simply against the ohmic or ordinary resistance of the
conductor, by reason of which heat is generated, but also against a counter
E. M. F. of its own creating. We are familiar with this division of work
when power is transmitted to an electric motor. The applied or impressed
E. M. F. then meets with ohmic resistance, generating heat, and with a
counter E. M. F. in the motor, the armature of which is turning in a mag-
netic field; and, in virtue of this counter E. M. F., a part of the energy


applied to the circuit is converted into mechanical work at the motor.
Energy may thus be stored up through the counter E. M. F. arising in the
motor.
In an analogous way, when energy is applied to an alternating current
circuit a part of it is lost in heat, and a part is alternately stored up in the
magnetic field, and again restored to the circuit. A small portion, in
practical working probably a very small portion of the energy, is trans-
mitted outward into space as electro-dynamic waves with the velocity of
light. Such a circuit possesses two qualities, resistance and inductance.
The former is a property by virtue of which the passage of a current is
accompanied by the irreversible transformation of electric energy into
heat; the latter is a property by virtue of which the passage of a current
is accompanied by the absorption of energy in the form of a magnetic field.
A part of the energy spent on the conductor is frittered away in irrecover-
able heat, while the other part is associated with the circuit in a recover-
able form. When the applied electro-motive force diminishes or ceases
altogether this stored up energy operates to carry the current forward.
On account of self-induction a current appears to possess inertia, and so
resists any change tending in either the direction of increase or of decrease.
A fly wheel to which a turning force is applied to increase the angular ve-
locity is the mechanical analogue. Suppose no resistance except friction
opposes the motion of the wheel. Then a part of the energy applied is
converted into heat by friction, and a part is stored up in the motion of
the wheel in a recoverable form to be given out or restored when the turn-
ing force is withdrawn. The effect of the inertia of the Wheel is to resist
the force tending to increase angular acceleration, and to keep up the mo-
tion of the wheel in the positive direction when the twisting force is with-
drawn. So the inertia or self-induction of a current opposes any change
either, of increase or decrease in the current. It does more; it continues
the current in the positive direction even after the impressed E. M. F. is
entirely withdrawn. If the force applied to the fly wheel is gradually
brought to a zero value, and is then gradually applied with increasing in-
tensity in-the opposite direction the wheel will "continue to turn in the
positive sense after the force is applied in the negative sense. In other
words the phase of the wheel's motion lags behind that of the applied
force, its zero occurring later than the zero of the force. During this
period of motion in one direction, and force applied in the other, the wheel
is doing work on the agent applied to it. While the angular velocity of
the wheel is increasing the agent is doing work on the wheel, and the
wheel is storing up energy. In quite the same way when a simple periodic
7


The Technic.
E. M. F. acts on an inductive circuit, the current lags behind the E. M. F.
in phase. It reaches its maximum value after that of the impressed E.
M. F. by an interval equal to the angle of lag expressed in time, and
passes through its zero value at an equal interval of time later than the
zero of E. M. F.
Hence there arises a second fact worthy of particular attention.
The maximum current never reaches a value equal to the maximum
E. M. F. divided by the resistance of the circuit, but falls short
of this by a quantity depending upon the coefficient of self-induction, and
the rapidity of alternation. By coefficient of self-induction is generally
meant a constant L such that the product of this constant, and the rate of
increase or decrease of the current is the E. M. F. of self-induction. By
Ohm's law the current equals the E. M. F. divided by the resistance; in
alternating currents in an inductive circuit the maximum current equals
the maximum E. M. F. divided by a quantity \/Rz + L! p* , in which B
is ordinary resistance, L the coefficient of self-induction or the inductance,
2 F
and p equals —, T being the period of alternation. The above expres-
sion is now often called impedance or sometimes " apparent resistance."
Another noticeable difference between direct and alternating currents
is that while with the former the rate of doing work is the product of the
current and the E. M. F. or C E. in the latter the mean activity is half
the product of the maximum E. M. F., the maximum current and the
cosine of the angle of lag, or J E C cos *. When the angle of lag is zero
the activity is a maximum or J E C. When the lag is 90°, or a quarter of
a period, the activity is zero. Thus we have the remarkable combination
of an E. M. F. applied to a circuit, a current flowing through it, and still
no work done upon the circuit. "In this case there is no frictional dissi-
pation of energy, but simply a give and take of energy between the mag-
netic field and the source of energy supplying the E. M. F." Thus the
mains of an alternating circuit may be joined by a conductor of such high
inductance that approximately no energy will be transmitted across from
main to main. Such is the case with a so-called " choking coil," or with a
transformer with its secondary circuit open.
Another point to which the electrician may profitably devote extended
contemplation is the measurement of electrical quantities on alternating
circuits. Several devices have been invented to serve as current integ-
rators, notably those of Mr. Shallenberger, and Professor Elihu Thomson;
but these are instruments serving rather for the commercial purposes of
central station work than for scientific measurements of precision. The


69
Siemens electro-dynamometer, when properly made of approximately norv
inductive ressistance, serves for the measurement of the mean square of
the current. It can be shown that the square root of this mean square
is equal to the maximum value of a current following the simple periodic
law divided by the square root of two. To measure voltage the ordinary
high resistance instruments will not answer at all, because they have high
inductance. The Cardew voltmeter, which acts by the heat expansion of a
straight wire, and some form of electrostatic instrument are the only devices
serving for the measurement of a periodic E. M. F. These again measure
the mean square of the E. M. F. and this bears the same relation to the
maximum E. M. F. as the mean square of the current bears to the maxi-
E C
mum current. Hence the product of these two quantities equals - —.
a
Neither of these instruments, however, gives any indication touching the
important angle of lag, and therefore they give no information respecting
the electrical energy in the circuit, nor of the alternate storing and restor-
ation of energy by means of the magnetic field Dr. Louis Duncan has
measured the efficiency of a transformer by means of a huge calorimeter.
This method is undoubtedly accurate if carefully applied, but it is not
sufficiently simple for general laboratory use. Much remains to be done
in this direction. Very much might be said in favor of electric lighting
by alternating currents. Scientific tests have shown that the efficiency of
such a system is not so high as its promoters would have us believe. Its
great and undoubted advantage lies in its ability to transmit energy to a
distance at high voltage, transforming to low voltage at the points where
the energy is to be utilized in lighting. For high voltage means small
conductors and economy in transmission, and low voltage at the glow lamp
is a necessity.


E. B. PERRY, '89.
With the multiplication of bridges and the great increase in the navi-
gation of our inland waters, has arisen the necessity of placing a draw-
span in many of these bridges, which may be swung into mid-stream to
allow the free passage of vessels. The time required to make the swing
becomes a matter of considerable importance when we consider the
amount of traffic that passes to and fro over some of our large bridges,
and it is proposed to give a brief description of a recent installation of a
steam plant for turning the bridge over the Saginaw River at Third Street
in Bay City. The draw-span of this bridge is 200 ft. long and weighs
something over 300 tons. By means of four distributing girders it rests
on a drum made of a 20 inch steel I Beam and rolled to a circle whose
diameter is 34 ft. This drum turns on 44 cast iron wheels 16 inches in
diameter and 6}4 inches face. Besides this the table has a 20 inch bear-
ing in the centre and is kept in place by a 6 inch cast iron pin.
The engine house is placed 22 ft. above the roadway and is 18 ft. by
24 ft. The equipment here consists of an upright boiler 52 inches in
diameter and containing 136 flues 2 inches in diameter; a tank holding
720 gallons and supplied either from the city service through a pipe laid
over the top chord of the bridge, or by a Worthington pump placed on
the table below the roadway; a feed pump, a Little Giant Injector, a
Stillwell exhaust steam feed-water heater and a double engine with cylin-
ders 9 inches diameter and 12 inch stroke. The engine is provided with
link-motion and is outlined in Figs. 1 and 2. The two operations of slew-
ing the bridge and raising the end lifts are performed through the friction
gears on the main shaft. The steel cut pinion K on the engine shaft
drives this shaft by means of the mortice gear J. The friction F slides on
a feather and thus revolves with the main shaft, while it carries on its
face blocks of hard maple E, whose faces are turned to the proper angle
and through which the entire power is transmitted. The steel bevel gear
H is cast without hub or arms and is bolted securely to the friction ti, a
section of whose rim is a frustum of a cone, whose angle is exactly the


71


The Technic.


73
same as the angle of the maple frictions. It is evident now that by
bringing the two parts of the frictions together the motion of E will be
imparted to H, while upon withdrawing F the shaft will revolve freely
within G. To facilitate the operation of releasing the friction a heavy
spring is placed between the hubs F and G and G is kept securely from
sliding on the shaft by means of bronze collars. The friction F is caused
to slide on its feather in the following manner: A cross-key Z passes
through the shaft and bears against the hub of F, being given free play
back and forth in a slot in the shaft. This key is let in slightly into a
plunger D which extends to the end of the shaft—the key and plunger
rotating with the shaft. The plunger is caused to enter the shaft or al-
lowed to retreat from it by turning the screw C either one way or the
other, a very slight turn of the screw sufficing to bring the friction into
contact with the gear. Ample provision is made for taking the thrust on
the shaft and for oiling the various parts. The construction of the other
friction is precisely the same as the one described. The operator stands
behind the engine and controls the motions by means of the hand wheels
L and N, Fig. 2, and O, Fig. 1. The hand wheels are in connection with
trains of mitre gears through which the mitres A on screws C are turned,
a quarter of a turn only of the hand wheels being required. The lever 0
is connected by means of a reach rod to the rack-shaft on the engine, and
is also connected to an arm on the spindle of the throttle-valve. The ad-
justment has been made by means of the turn-buckle so that the valves of
the engine are opened just ahead of the throttle. The simplicity of this
arrangement must be apparent and the efficiency has been proved by ex-
perience. The connections of the hand wheels and lever are carried to
the floor of the bridge so that the bridge is at all times under the control
of the bridge-tender and may be operated with equal facility in either
place. In the actual operation of the engines it has been found that the
frictions serve admirably as a brake when it is desired to slow down
while swinging into place. The two motions, it will be observed, are en-
tirely independent of each other. Proceeding below the engine-room
floor, the power for slewing is transmitted through the pairs T and W of
mitre gears to the machinery in the table itself below the roadway. Part
of this machinery is represented in Fig. 3, where U is a section of one of
the cast wheels connected to the spider in the centre, by the rod J, and
N is the stationary rack bolted to the stone pier. The teeth of the rack
and its engaging pinion E are of the involute form, Z% inch pitch and 7
inch face. On the same shaft with E is the large crown wheel T. The
greatest strain is of course in this shaft and great care has been required
to secure the boxes firmly to the 20 inch I beam shown in the figure.


The Technic.
Very heavy braces with turn-buckles afford ample lateral stiffness.
The details of the connections are plain from the figure. The power is
transmitted through the bevel gears P and E, the latter of which is loose
on the shaft and only transmits the power when the clutch is in engage-
ment with it. When the clutch is pulled up on its feather the bridge may
be swung by hand or horse-power from the floor of the bridge without
turning any unnecessary machinery. This much of the turning gear is
duplicated exactly on the opposite extremity of the diameter of the rack
—the horizontal shafts shown, connecting the two. Unless some plan
were devised for equalizing the strain on the two pinions, meshing with
the rack, it might easily be possible for one of them to take it all. It was
desired that such should not be the case, and the arrangement of gearing
shown at the right of Fig. 3 was used. The horizontal shaft from the engine
passes through box K terminating with a bevel pinion which transmits its
power to the large bevel gear marked A. This gear is loose on the ex-
tremities of the horizontal shafts which meet in the centre of its hub, and
carries around with it, in boxes cast in its arms, the two pinions B.


The Technic.
These pinions may turn freely on their own shafts and mesh with gears C,
keyed fast to the two shafts respectively. Now if the strain was exactly
the same in the two horizontal shafts, pinions B would never turn, but
any difference of strain is equalized at once through them and thus a
positive engagement at the two points of the rack is always assured. The
power for raising and lowering the jacks is transmitted through mitres U,
Fig. 1, and a corresponding pair on the opposite side of the bridge, to the
long horizontal shaft which runs either way from the centre in the bottom
chord to the extremities of the draw-span. A cross-section of the bottom
chord is shown in Fig. 4. The shaft from the engine is connected by
means of spur gears to the shaft on which the mitre M is keyed. The
power is thus transmitted through N to the shaft K which has at its ex-
tremity the worm shown behind the worm wheel H. H is keyed fast to
the jack-screw S which carries at its lower extremity the shoe C and is
threaded in its upper part to enter the casting B. The cap E for the base-
casting F is provided with a screw and holes for hand that it may be used
either for adjustment or as an ordinary hand power jack. It will be
noticed that in raising or lowering the jacks the worm wheel H travels up
and down with reference to the worm. For this reason it was necessary
to give the worm wheel a straight and wide face. Each of the four cor-
ners of the bridge is equipped as shown in Fig. 4 and each jack is capable
of lifting 20,000 pounds. The exact position of the jacks may be read at
any moment by the operator in charge from an indicator in the engine
room. The plant is designed to raise the jacks and swing the bridge 180°
in one minute and a half. It would be possible to swing even more
rapidly than this, but the time is consumed in overcoming the inertia of
the heavy structure when starting and stopping. The gearing throughout
is of cast steel while all of the shafting is of rolled steel, and it is believed
that even the extraordinary strains this class of machinery is subjected
to, have been successfully provided for in this plant.

The question of the water supply of small cities is one of great inter-
est and importance. There are in the United States each year about
40,000 deaths from typhoid fever and not less than ten times this number
of cases of sickness from the same disease. Many eminent sanitarians
believe that impure drinking water is the sole cause of typhoid fever, and
all physicians agree that such water is accountable for the great majority
of the cases. It is certain that if contamination of the water, soil and air
with animal excretions were wholly prevented there would be no typhoid
fever. This is no idle dream of visionary students of public health. It is
already a practically accomplished fact in a few cities. In 1849 the death rate
from typhoid fever in Munich was 24.6 per 10,000 inhabitants. At that time
the excretions from the body were deposited in privy vaults and the drinking
water was taken from shallow wells closely adjacent to the receptacles of
filth. First, sewers were built and the use of vaults prohibited. Later, a
fresh water supply was introduced, and in 1884 the death rate from
typhoid fever in Munich had fallen to less than 0.5 per 10,000 inhabitants.
A result almost equally striking has been accomplished at Vienna. Even
in New York with its notoriously garbage filled alleys, the death rate from
typhoid fever, thanks to care taken with the water supply, is only 2 per
10,000 and in Brooklyn only 1.5 per 10,000, while the average throughout
the United States is about 6.6. In truth, this, the typical filth disease of
the century, is more prevalent in the small cities and villages than in the
crowded metropolis with its great hordes of paupers from every nation
gathered in its huge tenement houses.
If typhoid fever has been practically stamped out of existence in
Munich and Brooklyn, why should it be allowed to prevail in our small
cities and villages? The failure to prevent the ravages of this disease
cannot be attributed to ignorance of its nature and origin. We are not in
the condition of the inhabitants of London, when visited by the black
plague in the 17th century. They were attacked by an unknown foe.
They knew nothing of the origin of the disease and practically nothing of


The Technic.
the means by which it was spread. They were struck down by an invisi-
ble hand. This is not true to-day and especially not true of typhoid
fever. The enemy hangs out its banner from every slaughter house the
offal from which pollutes the river or lake from which the city takes its
water supply. It establishes its garrison of germs in every filthy cess-pool
and vault. Notwithstanding these visible evidences of the approach of
this disease, it is allowed to slay 40,000 of the "flower of the land" an-
nually.
Would it pay to exterminate this disease? In answering this ques
tion, I will lay aside all questions of sentiment and look at the matter ex-
clusively from pecuniary standpoints. Conservative estimates place the
value of the average adult life to the state at $1,000. This is reached in
two ways: (1) the average production of the adult, and (2) the average
cost of rearing a person from birth to the age when that person becomes
able to support himself. If the average adult life is worth to the state
$1,000, the average life of those destroyed by typhoid fever is still greater;
because the majority of deaths from this disease occur in early manhood
or womanhood. But taking this estimate, the financial loss to this country
yearly in the deaths from typhoid fever amounts to $40,000,000. Then
there are at least 360,000 who are sick, but not fatally, who are incapaci-
tated from labor for weeks. The sum lost to the state in this item would
reach up among the millions. It should be remembered that these figures
represent an annual loss, and it will be admitted that these sums saved
for a few years would supply every city of 2,000 or more inhabitants in
this country with a safe drinking water supply.
SOURCES OF SUPPLY.
Waters used for public supply may be divided into surface and sub-
terranean. Amo*ng the former are those from rivers, lakes, shallow
wells and superficial springs. Among these are to be found some most
excellent waters and many which are exceedingly dangerous. The purity
of a surface water will depend upon the condition of the soil upon which
it falls, over which it flows, or through which it percolates. The waters
of mountain and highland lakes are among the purest found in nature,
and the majority of rivers furnish a safe potable water unless they be
contaminated by sewerage in one form or another; but as soon as such
contamination begins these waters are no longer free from danger. No
surface water is perfectly safe as a public supply unless the territory
which it drains can be protected from the introduction of harmful mate-
rial. A single slaughtering house or privy vault on the bank of a stream


79
and pouring its refuse into the same either directly or by filtration
through the soil for a short distance may poison the water used by a city.
Unless the various State legislatures take up this matter and make the
polution of streams and lakes a penal offense the time will soon come
when no river or small lake in our country will furnish a safe supply of
drinking water. Such protection has been furnished the Croton water by
the State of New York for many years with a gratifying success as is
shown by the low mortality from typhoid fever in New York city, already
referred to. It has been proposed that certain streams should be selected
for water supplies and their polution be prevented, while the use of other
water courses for the disposal of sewerage be permitted. A surface water
under the existing state of things may be fairly pure and perfectly safe to-
day, when a month later it may be swarming with the germs of typhoid
fever.
In the less densely settled parts of the country many lakes now offer
a fairly good water supply, but unless the drainage-area of these lakes be
protected from contamination their clear waters will become the bearers
of disease and death to those who drink of them. In Massachusetts the
State board of health is given general supervision of the water supplies
of cities, and the contamination of a stream can be prevented, by applica-
tion to the Supreme Court, for a distance of twenty miles above the intake.
This distance is too short and in time will be extended. With improved
methods of the disposal of waste by means of sewerage farms the neces-
sity of poluting streams will, we may hope, be removed soon. Local au-
thorities, unaided by the state, find their jurisdiction too limited to cope
with this subject. At a recent meeting of the American Public Health
Association, the following resolution was adopted: "Resolved, That it is
the well considered belief of this Association that it is an imperative
necessity, especially in the more populous states, that the state legisla-
tures should give their boards of health that financial support which
would enable them to act intelligently on all questions pertaining to the
public water supplies, investing them at the same time with the super-
vision of the said supplies, and with the power to preserve these waters
from contamination by sewage or other injurious matters." This repre-
sents the present feeling of the most intelligent sanitarians of this coun-
try in regard to the employment of surface waters for the supply of cities
and villages.
Shallow wells are notoriously impure, because almost universally they
are placed in close proximity to privy-vaults, cesspools, or other re-
ceptacles of filth. Surface springs are no better. A spring is to be re-


The Technic.
garded as a surface one if its water is influenced in amount or character by
recent rains, or if the temperature of the water varies decidedly with the
seasons of the year. It was formerly thought that filtration through a few
feet of soil was sufficient to purify a water, but the writer showed in 1880
that the ordinary gravel which constitutes so large a proportion of the soil
of Southern Michigan has but little effect in removing or oxidizing soluble
nitrogenous substances from solutions which are allowed to pass through
such soils. Furthermore, he demonstrated that such soils soon become
saturated, and then no longeFhave any effect upon the removal or oxida-
tion of these organic substances. The excretions from a family of six per-
sons are sufficient when dissolved to saturate over seven cubic feet of
gravel soil. From this it is evident that only a few weeks, or months at
most, would suffice with a proper amount of rain-fall to saturate every
cubic foot of soil to a depth of five or ten feet in a small yard in which we
often find privy-vault, cesspool, and cistern, or well, in close proximity.
Of course if these substances are not destroyed by filtration, they will be
carried by the water which passes through the soil wherever such water
may go. If the water gains an entrance to the well, it will carry with it
the substances in solution. At this rate it would require more than a few
feet, or even rods, of intervening soil to prevent the contamination of the
water of wells or leaky cisterns from privy-vaults, which often are not
cleaned once a year, or from cesspools or cemeteries.
By subterranean waters, we mean those the source of which lies below
some impervious geological formation. Such waters are protected, if
properly piped, from surface contamination, and are the only natural
waters which we may hope to find wholly free from germs. Deep springs
supply the purest waters in the world. Unfortunately, however, such
springs are rare, they are often not within the reach of cities, and the
amount of water which they supply is limited. The waters of artesian
wells frequently contain so much mineral matter that they are not suited
for use. When this is not the case, the amount is likely to be too small.
However, a few large cities have'been fortunate enough to obtain an
abundant supply of good subterranean waters. This is true, for instance,
of Brooklyn, N. Y., and of Memphis, Tenn. Vienna has recently changed
its supply from the dirty Danube to deep springs, and while the annual
death rate from typhoid fever was as high as 34 per 10,000 inhabitants,
the disease has become so rare that when a case of it is brought from out-
side of the city to the great hospital, it is, according to Prof. Nothnagel,
shown to the students as a great treat.

THE PURIFICATION OF WATER.
Many attempts have been made to purify foul water on an extensive
scale, and these have been partially successful. The muddy water of the
Mississippi river at St. Louis is collected in settling basins. There are
four of these basins and each holds about 18 million gallons. The floors
are paved with brick, and these are cleaned about three times per year,
the quantity of. deposit removed annually amounts to nearly 200,000 cubic
yards, and there can be no question that it is better to have this vast
amount of filth deposited in the settling basins rather than in the
alimentary canals of the consumers. During the spring, the 20 millions of
gallons daily distributed to the citizens of Cleveland contain about ten
and one-half tons of suspended matter. It would be well if this could be
gotten rid of by sedimentation in basins. Preparations of iron are some-
times added to the water in order to make the precipitation more complete.
However, while the water is much improved by sedimentation, the germs
of typhoid fever are not gotten rid of in the process. Indeed, as sedi-
mentation goes on in the basins, the germs, if present are constantly mul-
tiplying.
Many devices for the purification of water by filtration, or by precipi-
tation and filtration are now in use. Some of these methods are eminently
successful in rendering a turbid water clear, and in thus far improving its
quality, but none of them are capable of rendering a disease-producing
water safe. The water-supply at Atlanta is so muddy and so deeply col-
ored with red clay that it cannot be used for laundry purposes, but after
precipitation with alum and filtration, small objects may be distinctly seen
through 20 feet of the water. However, clearness is no evidence that the
water does not contain the germs of disease.
THE EXAMINATION OF DRINKING WATER.
The sanitary examination of water should be both chemical and bac-
teriological. The following 1 regard as necessary conditions of all such
examinations.
(1). The report must be made to the health officer within a week, at
most. Typhoid fever appears in a village. The doctor at once suspects
the drinking water. He naturally weighs the evidence before him, and
comes to some conclusion, right or wrong, in case there are several sources
from which the sick may have obtained the poison, as to the exact water,
which is at fault. There are always those who disagree with the doctor,
or, as is likely to be the case, a rival physician has as many cases, and he
is equally certain that some Other water is ttie cause of the trouble; and


The Technic.
there are still in the land, physicians who believe that the poison of ty-
phoid fever does not enter the system with the drinking water, and that
the disease is due to certain meteorological or other equally undefined con-
ditions. Each side has its partisans, and much bad blood not infrequently
makes itself manifest. The health officer sends to the laboratory one or
more samples of water, and the report is anxiously looked for. We there-
fore regard all methods of water analysis, which require more than a week
at most before the health officer receives his return as not suitable for our
purposes. For this reason we have been compelled to give up the idea,
with which we started out, of identifying positively and certainly all the
germs which might be present in the water, before reporting to the health
officer.
(2) . If the water is bad, the fact should be so plainly and forcibly set
forth in the report that no reasonable person can question it. It can
hardly be expected that a chemical analysis alone will do this.
(3) . The reports should be made in such a manner that they will be
scientifically as well as practically of value. After several years of such
work we hope to have a mass of evidence in these reports, which may fur-
nish us with the key te certain problems which to-day cannot be solved.
(4) . When the report is made, the work with that sample of water
should be left in such a condition that for strictly scientific purposes it can
be continued.
The method of procedure pursued in the hygienic laboratory of the
University of Michigan, is as follows:
If a health officer, or other person has signified his intention of send-
ing a sample of water, we express to him a one gallon sterilized glass stop-
pered bottle surrounded by a light wooden frame. This is filled with the
water and returned. As soon as it reaches the laboratory, gelatine plates
are made, and a tube of sterilized beef-tea is inoculated with one drop of
the water. The plates are kept at the ordinary temperature of the room,
and the germs developed on these are counted after 24, 48, and 72 hours.
The tube of beef-tea is placed in an incubator and kept at 38° C. for 24
hours, after which an animal is inoculated. In the great majority of cases,
if there are poison-producing germs present, the animal dies within 12
hours. The post-mortem is made and plates inoculated from the liver,
spleen, kidney, and sometimes other organs. Within 36 hours more the
germs on these plates have developed. In the meantime the chemical and
microscopical examinations have been made, and 72 hours after tha water
has been received, the report is complete.

The morphology, the physiology, and the chemistry of the microor-
ganisms can then be worked out at leisure.
The following is a copy of the blank used for making the report:

The Technic.
can be given, the following conclusions may be regarded as approximately
correct:
(1) The total residue should not exceed 500 parts per million.
(2) The inorganic residue may constitute the total residue.
(3) The smaller the amount of organic residue, the better the water.
(4) The amount of earthy bases should not exceed 200 parts per million.
(5) The amount of sddium chloride should not exceed 10 parts per million.
A larger amount may be expected, however, in certain salt-pro-
ducing districts.
(6) The amount of sulphates should not exceed 100 parts per million.
(7) The organic matter in one million parts of the water should not re-
duce more than 8 parts of potassium permanganate.
(8) The amount of free ammonia should not exceed 0.05 part per million.
(9) The amount of albuminoid ammonia should not exceed 0.15 part per
million.
&lt;10) The amount of nitric acid should not exceed 0.5 part per million.
&lt;U) The best waters contain no nitrous acid, and any water which contains
this substanceln quantity sufficient 'to be estimated, should not
be regarded as a safe drinking water.
Note.—The word " trace," whenever used, Indicates the existence of the sub-
stance in quantity sufficient to be recognized by the test, but too small to be deter-
mined quantitatively.
MICROSCOPICAL EXAMINATION.
Description of deposit, if any, magnified 100 diameters
Same magnified 500 diameters
EXPLANATION.
Six ounces of the water are placed in a conical glass, and the deposit,
if any, is examined after from 12 to 24 hours. The presence of any ap-
preciable deposit, especially if it be of animal or vegetable nature, would
detract from the suitability of the water.
BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION.

EXPLANATION.
One drop of water is added to one drachm of some culture medium,
such as beef tea, and this after it has been kept at the temperature of the
body for 24 hours or longer is used for inoculating animals.

LISTS OF BOOKS.
The following lists of books were prepared by the professors in the
different branches of the engineering work in answer to the question from
the Technic board—What books would you advise a young engineer to buy
first after leaving college t
BOOKS RELATING TO CIVIL ENGINEERING.
The young civil engineer who has worked his way through the diffi-
culties which he has not infrequently encountered in the pages of Ran-
kine's Civil Engineering, finds, upon completing that book, that he has had
at least a good introduction to the broad underlying principles of engi-
neering, and has laid a solid foundation upon which to build up a more
detailed study of any of the several specialties into which his chosen
profession is now divided. Rankine's Civil Engineering, possibly more
than any other of his valuable books, is hard for the beginner to master
unassisted; one who has read much in other authors will find easier pro-
gress; and the assistance of a teacher ought to render its study satisfac-
tory and profitable.
A young engineer desiring to pursue further the study of strength and
resistance of materials may take up Burr on the Elasticity and Resistance
of the Materials of Engineering, New York, Wiley &amp; Sons, $5.00, the first
part of which book deals with the theory of the subject and the second
with results of experimental tests.
Gillmore, on Limes, Hydraulic Cements and Mortar, New York, Van
Nostrand, $4.00, is a standard authority on the subjects which its title in-
dicates.
Baker, on Masonry Construction, New York, Wiley &amp; Sons, $5.00 cov-
ers in a most admirable way the matter of foundations and allied con-
structions, giving facts and figures in generous profusion.
Gillmore, on Roads, Streets and Pavements, New York, Van Nostrand,
$2.00, and
Pavements and Roads, their Construction and Maintenance, New York,


89
The Engineering and Building Record, $5.00, will be useful to the city
engineer.
In addition to Burr's book mentioned above, and his Stresses in Bridge
and Roof Trusses, $3.50, which treats those structures by mathematical
analysis,
DuBois' Strains in Framed Structures, New York, Wiley &amp; Sons,
$10.00,
Waddell's Designing of Ordinary Highway Bridges, New York, Wiley
&amp; Sons, $2.00, and a comparatively new English book
Fidler's Practical Treatise on Bridge Construction, Philadelphia, J. B.
Lippincott &amp; Co., $7.50, will broaden the view, but by no means exhaust
the subject for the designing and constructing civil engineer.
It is unnecessary to remark in this connection to any of his pupils
that the writer-believes earnestly in the uttHty «f the study of Graphics,
especially as used in his Roofs, Bridges and Arches, the graphical going
hand in hand with the mathematical treatment of these three subjects, and
aiding the student by the presentation of different points of view.
Vose's Manual for Railroad Engineers, Boston, Lee &amp; Shepard, $12.50,
will be found easy of mastery and helpful in its line, giving results and
facts rather than theory.
Trautwine's Civil Engineer's. Pocket-Book, New York, Wiley &amp; Sons,
$5.00, is too well-known to need description, and is a treasure-house of
facts and rules covering about the whole field. It has passed through so
many editions and been so carefully revised as to be extremely trust-
worthy.
Wellington's Economic Theory of Railway Location, New York, Engi-
neering News, $5.00, is an admirable treatise on the classes of problems
which should be thoroughly studied by the locating engineer, the influ-
ence of distance, curvatures and grades on .traffic and operating expenses.
Drinker, on Tunnelling, Explosive Compounds', and Rock Drills, New
York, Wiley &amp; Sons, $25.00 is a very -comprehensive and satisfactory vol-
ume, abounding in information, upon the subject which its title indicates.
The hydraulic engineer cannot do amiss in adding to his Merriman's
Hydraulics, New York, Wiley &amp; Sons, $3.50, Fanning's Water Supply En-
gineering, New York, Van Nostrand, $5.00, an American book, not so
strongly technical as some others, and Humber's Water Supply of Cities
and Towns, the English edition of which, London, Crosby, Lockwood &amp;
Son, costs £6 6s., but a reprint by Engineering News, New York, was sold
for $20.00. It contains descriptions and full illustrations of various carefully
constructed foreign works.


The Technic.
The sanitary engineer will find that Adams' Sewers and Drains for
Populous Districts, New York, Van Nostrand, is devoted more par-
ticularly to drainage projects where storm waters are included, and Staley
and Pierson's Separate System of Sewerage, New York, Van Nostrand,
$2.50, those undertakings where storm-waters are largely excluded. Both
are excellent. Baldwin Latham's Sanitary Engineering, an English work,
reprinted by Engineering News, is a sound treatise, but is probably out of
print. Waring's Sanitary Drainage of Houses and Towns, $6.00, is also
most serviceable.
I would close by mentioning as among the useful books for the engi-
neer, Weisbach's Mechanics of Engineering; Stoney's Theories of Strains in
Girders and Similar Structures, $12.50; Merriman's Least Squares, $2.00,
and Clark's Building Superintendence, Boston, Tichnor, $3.00.
C. E. Greene.
BOOKS RELATING TO MECHANICAL ENGINEERING.
The following list of books recommended for mechanical engineers is
in no sense complete, but contains the standard works (of moderate price)
which should be found in every mechanical engineer's library. An effort
has been made to select books covering a broad field of work rather than
any special field. Many very valuable works have been omitted on account
of their high price. This list given can be purchased for about $75.00:
Mechanics of Engineering. Theoretical Mechanics. Translation by
Coxe. J. Weisbach, $10.00; D. Van Nostrand. An excellent standard
work.

The Technic.
Fifteen twenty-minute tests were made on this pump—six being with
the shortest stroke obtainable and nine with the longest stroke the pump
would stand without pounding at the highest speeds. Tests were with
three different heads and at three different speeds for each head, the ob-
ject being to find the most economical method of running the pump as
regards steam consumption for a definite amount of work.
The stroke was measured by allowing a pencil fixed in the clamp on
the piston rod to trace a line on a card held by it.
There are two suction and two exit valves each 2)£ in. in diameter
and having a net opening of 1.52 sq. in., as measured by the planimeter,
and weighing 0.2 lb. The suction and delivery pipes are respectively 1)^
in. and 1 in. in diameter. The pressure per sq. in. necessary to lift the
valves was weighed for different lifts and found to have an average value
of 0.57 lb.

An examination of the above shows that the steam for operating the
valve does not vary greatly in amount and perhaps this may be due to
condensation making up at the slow speeds for the diminution in the
amount actually us«d in moving the valve.
The vacuum gauge was connected to the cylinder immediately below
the suction valves and the pressure guage just above the exit valves so
that the losses shown are due to passage through the valves. Taking an
average of all the determinations of this loss for the actual loss we have:
average loss at suction valve, 1.75 lbs., which, diminished by 0.57 lbs.,
the average loss due to lifting the valves, gave 1.18 lbs. loss due to fric-


97
tion; average loss at exit valve, 1.49 lbs., which, diminished, as before,
by 0.57 lbs., gave .92 lbs. loss due to friction here.
The steam per H. P. per hour decreased with the lengthening of the
stroke, with increase of head, and, whatever the head, decreased with the
speed. This might have been expected, as, with the changes indicated,
the per cent. • of- condensation was very much decreased, as shown by a
succeeding column.
The duty-for each of the-five series of tests increases with the speed;
the maximum duty for each series is at the highest speed for that series
and these maximum values form an increasing series—increasing with in-
crease of head pumped against and with increase of length of stroke.
Moreover, with this increase of total work done, we find a decrease of loss
of action and friction, or a decrease of the per cent, of lost work, and con-
sequently an increase of efficiency, still further emphasizing the gain in
economy by running at a high speed.
The steam per H. P. per hour by card was computed by the usual
formula, the clearance being one-half the total equivalent stroke of cylin-
der and clearance space minus the stroke as shown by the data sheet.
The steam accounted for by the card was approximately constant for each
of the three-test groups and ranged from 61.7 lbs. to 111.1 lbs. The per
cent, of condensation decreased with the speed and appeared to be about
the same at corresponding speeds of different heads and lengths of stroke.
From these observations it may be concluded and recommended that
the feed pump be run at a good smart speed for such part of the time as
will supply the boiler with the necessary water, rather than at a slow
speed running constantly. When buying a new pump, get one of such
size as will at a good speed have the required capacity—being sure of
enough margin for future iucreased demand for steam; or, better still, get
two smaller pumps having a combined capacity somewhat in excess of
the anticipated requirements. Then in case of accident to one, there will
be means of feeding the boilers.

POINTS ON MACHINE DESIGN IN STEEL WORKS.
FACTOKS OF SAFETY.
One thing which caught my attention when I first began on machinery
for steel works use was the tremendous factors of safety and the enormous
quantities of pig iron that were put into all the castings. It seemed to me
that the country would be ruined if things went on that way long. But
on going out into the works and seeing the machinery handled, especially
the cranes, I wondered that iron could be cast thick enough to stand the
pressure. The need of much common labor is an evil which a few of the
best companies only are taking any extensive steps to root out. But in
those companies labor saving machinery is being devised for every pur-
pose to head off the ravages of the "Polock" and Bohemian. But Rome
was not built in a day, and at present we must raise our factor of safety
high enough to withstand said ravages.
In roof and bridge work a factor of four or five is considered quite
sufficient for any contingency that may arise. The chances of cases in
which dangerous strains are set up in these structures are pretty well
known and to cheapen them some risk is taken—sometimes too much.
There is a Scylla and a Charybdis in the designing of every machine
or structure. One of these is excessive cost, and the other excessive risk
of breaking down. For different purposes these evils change their magui-
9


The Technic.
tudes to suit circumstances. There is a different end to attain in each
case. A rolling mill and a bicycle should not be designed similarly with
the same strains per sq. in. and the same care in finish. It is very im-
portant that a mill should be always ready to run, that it should be simple,
and all its parts made of such size that the roughest usage will not prove
injurious. A break down on a plate mill at a time when work is crowded,
and there are many orders to fill, means sometimes the loss of two or
three days. The heavy machinery cannot be handled quickly even if
spares are at hand ready to be put in place. The loss of the time there-
fore is of much more consequence than the loss of broken rolls or housings,
and the reason why strains of only 4,000 or 5,000 lbs. per sq. in. on wrought
iron or steel in tension, and 800 or 1,000 lbs. or less on castings are used in
•practice becomes evident when the circumstances are considered. It is
.much cheaper in other words to put in the extra iron—costing but a few
scents a lb. at most—than to save it scrupulously and lose thousands of
.dollars lying idle repairing machinery. As one of the great steel men in
.the country has said, "If you put in a few pounds too much metal you
.never know it, but if you don't get in enough you had better throw the
.whole thing away to begin with."
There is no way of calculating sizes in many places and, for that mat-
ter, no necessity where experience has shown proper proportions. How
.can the strain on the housings of a mill be figured when a large slab gets
stuck half-way through the rolls and stalls engine and fly wheel in one
revolution? It is hundreds of tons probably but we can only roughly ap-
proximate it. So too when one of the "pit gang" strips a hot ingot, and
lifts it out to the surface, and then tips it over with the tongs still attached
and lets it come down full force on the end of the jib of the crane, which
is made so as not to notice that anything has struck it.
These cranes must be made so as to allow all sorts of accidents and
carelessness. They must not be injured, for instance, if some sleepy
Italian lowers the jib down into a pile of ingots. You can't make him be
careful, so you must do the other thing,—make the crane as accommodat-
ing as possible.
CRANES.
Probably the most adjustable crane used in steel works at present is
the Welhnan Crane. The jib rolls up and down the mast, being free to
tip up without bending rods as the distance piece of steel plates between
the pairs of wheels simply rests on top of the plunger. The bottom cast-
ings are of open hearth steel and the mast turns on hard steel conical roll-


101
ers, all side thrusts being taken up by vertical rollers, also of hard steel
placed both at the top and bottom of the mast. This arrangement secures
even wear in case the mast works a little out of line.
The water is brought to the cranes under a pressure of 300 or 350 lbs.
per sq. in. This pressure with an eight inch plunger will lift comfortably
three tons on the jib, which is half as much again as the average weight
of ingots handled. Swivel connections are used under the cranes to allow
mast to turn—but one pipe being needed in case the crane uses water for
left cylinder only. The pit cranes as well as ladle cranes and converters
are all worked from one common platform—the "pulpit." But in case the
ladle crane is arranged to work entirely by power, i. e. turn, lift, run ladle
in and out, and tip same upside down, the boy who runs it is by necessity
placed on the crane with a miniature pulpit of his own. In this case the
pressure is taken in through a swivel connection at the mast head, the dis-
charge going out at the bottom.
The Aiken Crane in use in Pittsburgh and vicinity is after this same
principle only that the wheels on the jib are replaced by sliding shoes
which increases friction and wear very much apparently.
These types of cranes have almost replaced the old Holley Crane used
so extensively at first in all Bessemer plants. In this the cylinder was
stationary, and the jib was fixed to the long plunger which passed through
a top bearing fastened to the roof truss. When these cranes were raised,
the top of the plunger protruded up through the roof skyward, and the top
of it had to be kept greased for seven or eight feet of its length. To offset
this however, the plunger rested on a water step which made the cranes
very easy to turn. This excellent feature is used at present in cranes
made by the Morgan Engineering Co., of Alliance, 0., with the modifica-
tion that the water is used to reduce the pressure on the step rather than
carry the weight entire.
The best modern practice is toward making all movements from the
pulpit by power rotating by means of a hydraulic cylinder or a small 6x(i
reversing engine—using compressed air, the exhaust of which ventilates
the sewers that contain the pipes and connections to the pulpit. The load
is moved in and out on the jib by a hydraulic cylinder either attached
direct or having the stroke multiplied if compactness is desired.
The use of electricity in steel works for transmitting power is at pres-
ent very infrequent. Electric traveling cranes are being built bj Morgan
which bid fair to take the place of those operated by square shafts. Un-
questionably much of the machinery used in the manufacture of steel will

before many years add the buzz of its motors to the confusion of sounds
which now bewilders the stranger within the gates.
The steel business has as yet no settled routine or method of proced-
ure. There is room for hundreds of improvements that will aid in lessen-
ing the cost of this most useful metal. The way of bringing this about lies
very largely in more efficient means for handling large quantities easily.
That improvements are so slowly made arises I suppose from the usual
unwillingness of humanity to adopt any new thing without a hard fight—
a thing which is even yet a gigantic stumbling block in the pathway of
improvement. C. C. Smith.
SPECIFICATIONS.
On smaller engineering works one of the most important points in the
specifications is the retainder. It is only too well known that bonds as
ordinarily taken for the faithful and complete performance of the contract
are often worthless, for the reason that the amount involved does not
warrant the necessary suit to recover in cases of non-fulfillment. The
old idea was to retain a certain percentage, usually fifteen, of the
amount earned, the latter to be determined by the engineer's estimate.
A more modern, and in our judgment a better plan, is to retain a percent-
age of the entire contract price. This will require a contractor to put an
amount, probably equal to his anticipated profit into the work, and will have
a tendency to keep him at the work until it is completed, a very import-
ant consideration when so many contractors are inclined to jump their
contracts after the first estimate, if that be a large one.
In connection with specifications for water works construction many
engineers are accustomed to provide for an elaborate inspection of the
pipe as it is delivered from the carriers, by " ringing " with a hammer
and various other means. It has been our observation that this process
usually costs more than it comes to.
The proper test of the ability of a water-pipe to do its duty is to make
it do that duty. The idea seems to prevail that cast-iron pipe must be
handled as though it were plate-glass. It may be interesting to note that
the weight of metal usually put into a water-pipe is about four times that
required to withstand the, pressure within, allowing for a proper working
stress for the iron, and the balance of the metal is put thereforthe pur-
poses of convenience in casting and durability in handling, so that it is a
part of the original plan that the pipe shall be able to stand a reasonable
amount of banging around. While it is not infrequently the case that we


103
find broken pipe, indeed sometimes pipe broken in two, it does not ordi-
narily occur except where there is a defect in the iron. Owing to the
mode of casting usually adopted, with the bell up, the most defective part
will usually be found at the bell, caused by the impurities rising to that
place. The difficulty with a spongy bell is not so much that it may let
water through as that it may split in caulking, and the only way to tell
whether it will split is to caulk it. If it holds it is, ninety-nine cases in a
hundred, as good as a solid bell. On the other hand, we have known ap-
parently sound bells to split, the fracture revealing a streak of hard iron
or giving evidence of abnormal strains in cooling. It. is unnecessary to
state that any amount of "ringing " would fail to detect such defects. A
point that is often chosen as a weak one is the neck of the bell where it
joins the straight pipe. This, owing to a slight displacement of the core,
is often found to be thin, and accordingly a spike is driven through it and
the pipe condemned, while if put into the ditch the probabilities are that
the pipe would be amply strong, for at the point referred to the metal is
in the form of an arch against the pressure within, and the moment at the
point due to externally applied forces will not be nearly so great as nearer
the middle of the pipe where all joints are made in the trench as we
maintain they should be.
The specifications, to secure first-class work, should require all joints
to be made in the trench. Although it is quite possible to so suspend two
or even three lengths of pipe that there shall be no moment upon the
joints, and although acting upon this idea, nearly all contractors will at-
tempt to lay pipe that way, yet our own experience thus far has gone to
prove that good work will not be secured by such a plan. The joints that
are made on the bank become strained in going into the trench, and the
caulker who makes the joints in the ditch will hurry his work to keep up
with those on the bank. It is also of the utmost importance that the pipe
be tested as it is laid, before the trench is filled. Some contractors will
claim that this is unnecessary, because, as they say, a leak will be certain
to show itself at the surface in time. No greater fallacy than this
was ever taught. It is true that a large leak will be apt to come to the
surface sometime, but it may be many feet from the location of the defect,
and many weeks after its breaking out. It will be far more apt to show
itself if in damp ground than in dry. To give an idea of how long it may
take a leak to become manifest, even in case of a large one, the following
incident from the writer's own experience may be interesting. A line of
pipe was laid in November, and duly tested, but owing to the cold weather
and the danger of freezing the test could not with, safety be prolonged to

as full an extent of time as was desired. The soil was a dry yellow sand.
Late in the following May a very slight dampness was discovered above
the place of one of the tees leading to a hydrant. The water was shut off
from the line and an investigation commenced, when it was found that
through a sand-hole in the bottom side of the tee a jet of water was issu-
ing fully three-eighths of an inch in diameter, and had worn out a hole in
the sand underneath sufficiently large, that, when the water and loose
sand were dipped out of it, there was room to work a ratchet and tap out
the hole for a cast-iron plug.
The pressure carried was between fifty and sixty pounds per square
inch, so that at the time of discovery about sixteen gallons of water were
going to waste per minute.
A test made with a small feed pump on about three miles of line by
the writer during the past summer revealed the fact that not less than
thirty gallons of water per minute were being wasted, and in two months
not one of the leaks had come to the surface. A test of twenty-four hours
duration with the maximum working pressure in the open trench, while
not an absolute proof of tightness in a line, will be found to pay for itself
howsoever good the caulking may be as a rule.
In the Pennsylvania oil and gas regions it is customary to test with
air, and the joints are previously daubed with soap and water, which
shows bubbles if there is the slightest leak. The contractor's trick there
is to get some lime into the water. G. S. Williams, 'SS.

PRACTICAL POINTS IN CEMENT TESTING.
In testing cement there are some practical points and phenomena
that come to the inspector's notice—especially in regard to the consistency
of the mortar and the mixing and moulding of the briquette.
Previous to the system established by the American Society of Civil
Engineers for making cement tests, comparative results could not be com-
piled, owing to the fact that each engineer having charge of the tests on
the various important projects under construction had a distinct and sepa-
rate method for testing cement, and different ideas as to the proper con-
sistency of the mortar in order to obtain the best results. When the
American Society took steps to overcome this evil they laid the corner-
stone for the accumulation of a vast amount of valuable information.
The method of mixing mortar for a briquette, as employed on the
Cairo Bridge, also the St. Louis Merchant's Bridge, was very effective. A
water-tight box was constructed, about three feet long, just wide enough
to allow a hoe to slide in it; two inclined planes dipping toward the center
were then built in securely and the box was ready for use; from twelve
to fifteen ozs. of cement were put in the box, the required proportion of
water added, and with a firm, rapid use of the hoe it was found that the
cement and water were thoroughly mixed in one minute. The consistency
of the mortar, except for special tests, was what would be termed "stiff,"
and the proportion of water varied with different cements,—for Louisville
brands 25% water, and for Alsen's Portland W%% water was found to
give the best results.
Ice-water was used in mixing as it retarded the setting sufficiently so
that the briquette could be thoroughly moulded before the setting com-


The Technic.
menced, it being a well-demonstrated fact that to disturb mortar while
setting injures its strength more or less.
In working the mortar into the moulds no ramming was employed,
but only a firm and vigorous use of the trowel, taking about two minutes
to finish a briquette and endeavoring to expend on each briquette the
same amount of energy.
With the greatest care in the proportions of cement and water, and
in mixing and moulding, there is always a percentage of difference in the
breaking strain of from 4% to 10%, even with two briquettes made from
the same barrel of cement and the same mixing, and a greater percentage
of difference will occur if the inspector is careless. This percentage
of difference in the breaking strain has several causes; it may be partly
due to the cement, but it is more likely due to air-holes in the briquette
and unequal working of the cement into the moulds, so it may be stated
that to have two consecutive briquettes break at the same strain does not
often occur.
My experience in testing cements has clearly demonstrated to me that
it is a somewhat irregular unstable article, the manufacture of which re-
quires skilled hands, and that on engineering works of any importance,
especially where the work is of an hydraulic nature, testing is almost in-
dispensable, as it not only prevents poor cement from being used, but
protects the contractor and the engineer in charge.
Dwight C. Morgan, '93.
PIPE LAYING.
The method of laying pipe which in my experience I have found
most satisfactory is as follows: The trench being prepared and the pipe
delivered along it, a gang of five men armed with pevy stocks for carriers
come on and, in laying any pipe below and including eight inch, two of
them carry the pipe to the edge of the bank and pass it down to the two
in the trench while the fifth man attends to the alignment, and is gener-
ally the pipe laying foreman. The spigots are inserted in the bells which are
rested upon 4" x 4" blocks of wood about 8" long. This saves digging bell
holes if the ground be hard. If it be sand the two men in the ditch dig
the bell hole. On ten inch pipe the pipe is lowered into the ditch partly
by ropes, one at each end, and the men on the bank stand on the knotted
end of the rope while they manipulate the other with their hands, and so
allow the pipe to roll in. On twelve and fourteen inch pipe we usually
put two more men in the gang so that there may be four on the bank to
handle the ropes. This gang works entirely independent of the caulkers


107
and will sometimes be one or two days work ahead of them. When the
pipe is in proper line enough dirt is thrown in just back of the bell to
keep it from rolling and the joints are then ready for the yarner. The
yarner carries in addition to his yarning iron and hammer three or four
cold-chisels with long taper and some small lead plugs. With his chisels
as wedges he centers the spigot in the bell and then works in his yarn
and replaces his chisels by the lead plugs. The yarn is then well rammed
as usual and the joint is ready for pouring. The pourer uses a pouring
pot with hooks for carrying and tipping so that it can be worked easily in
a narrow ditch. Having put on the pipe jointer or roll, as the case may
ber he calls to his assistant on the bank for lead and runs the joint. The
caulkers follow, and when they have passed, the back-fillers come on and
load down the pipe with earth just back of the bell, tamping it carefully
around the neck and the pipe is then ready to be tested as soon as a valve
is reached to close its.end. Working men this way in a sandy ditch we
have seen twelve men, five layers, a yarner, a pourer and assistant, and
four caulkers, put into the trench and caulk ready for test 1840 feet of 6"
pipe, setting two hydrants, five tees and one gate, in ten hours, and dig-
ging all bell holes. This pipe tested for 24 hours at 160 lbs. pressure in
the open ditch showed only one leaking joint and this was repaired in
less than five minutes. On four inch pipe five layers and a yarner laid
and yarned 2022 feet using blocks, in seven hours. On eight inch pipe
eleven to thirteen hundred feet per day with specials is good work for a
gang of twelve men and on ten inch, sixteen men, two extra layers and
two extra caulkers will dispose of nine or ten hundred feet and on twelve
inch, about seven hundred feet.
We are aware that the above is not laying a vast amount of pipe
more than is frequently done with the derrick gang, but we have learned
that very little pipe that is laid ordinarily will stand the tests which we
have seen ours put to. During the past summer no less than three miles
of pipe was uncovered under our direction in the city of Owosso. This
pipe had been in the ground from one to three months, had been laid
with a guarantee that the joints should stand 200 lbs. pressure per square
inch, much of it, with a test in the open trench known to be imminent,
had been caulked by experienced caulkers who had been following the
trade for several years, and yet under 100 lbs. pressure, on the twelve
inch line, forty-three out of forty-seven consecutive joints were found to
leak; on the ten inch an entire block did not have a soXmd joint in it, on
eight inch about sixty per cent, of the joints leaked while on six and four
inch the percentage of leaking joints got down as low as thirty to forty.


The Technic.
Compare this with the record made by a gang working as above des-
cribed where we find in the latter case that one leaking joint in fifty was
about the average, and the advantages of the scheme described will be-
come more apparent.
G. S. Williams, '88.
CAULKING LEAD JOINTS.
The lead joint when properly made is considered by all authorities to
be the best yet devised for water, gas and oil pipes. Although in the
recent laying of natural gas mains in Detroit and elsewhere in the west
the screw joint wrought iron pipe has been used, it is hardly probable
that this will succeed the lead joint in popular favor. The writer was in-
formed by one of the skilled laborers employed on a line where both the
screw and lead joint were used that in a test of about 200 pieces of each—
the only test made on the entire line—it was found that 80 joints of the
screw pipe leaked while not a leak was developed in the lead.
In the lead joint a great deal depends upon the skill of the workman
who does the caulking. Anybody can pound lead but anybody cannot
make a tight joint. In making lead joints on oil and gas lines little or no
yarn is used but in water it is customary to fill from one quarter to one-
half the bell with yarn, as it has been found that two inches of lead well
driven is ample to withstand any ordinary pressure. The yarn put in
should be rammed in solidly with the yarning iron. If the joint be very
cold or at all damp it is always a good plan and sometimes a very neces-
sary one to pour in a little oil. The heavier the oil the better. This pre-
vents the lead chilling too soon and also prevents its spattering into the
face of the man pouring. The opening of the joint may be closed for
pouring either by a rope rolled in wet clay or by some one of the patent
jointers. The latter consist of a rubber band on the inner side of an in-
closed hoop of spring steel. At the ends of the hoop are rivetted two
lugs by means of which either with a clamp or tongs the jointer is closed
around the pipe. A small piece of clay is used as a gate around the open-
ing between the ends of the band which allows of pouring. The rubber
should be kept well smeared with clay and when so used will last for the
pouring of from five to six miles of pipe.
The use of the jointer will be found quite economical as it saves the
services of the boy who makes the rolls and a joint having been run with
a jointer on requires less time to caulk than one where the roll is used.
The tongs will be found much more serviceable than the clamp although


109
we have not yet been able to find a bouse which furnishes tongs but always
have to take clamps and have the tongs made by a blacksmith.
The pouring having been successfully accomplished, the caulking
proper begins. A good caulker will always caulk the bottom of his joints
first, because it is more difficult to do a good job there and if the top is
caulked last, the spigot A B is forced down against the lead at the bottom,
so tightening the joint there. In nearly twenty miles of pipe where this
rule was followed, although leaks were occasionally found on the top and
upper sides not one was found on the bottom. If a joint leaks on top it
is a very easy matter to drive the lead a little more and usually to close it
up, but a leak at the bottom is much more difficult to get at. This is one
of the best tests we know of of the ability and experience of a caulker.
Another good test is to have a man acknowledge that he cannot tell by
looking at a joint whether it will hold or not. If a man says that he can
it can generally be relied upon that he has not seen a great deal of work
tested.
The tools used in caulking are the yarning iron, having an edge about
1-16 of an inch by about a cold chisel to cut off the superfluous lead
and to start up a tight joint, and from four to ten sets varying in thickness
from 1-16 of an inch to % of an inch and about % of an inch broad at
the face. Some caulkers prefer those with the offset others those with
the single bend. The hammer used should weigh 1% to 2% or 3 pounds,
and should not be over 10 inches in length over all.
In caulking the joint there should first be used a narrow tool next to


The Technic.
the spigot, then one a size wider, and so on until one is reached which
about fills the joint and leaves a smooth face to the lead. In this way the
lead is forced into the recess in the bell and is also thoroughly consoli-
dated next to the spigot. If the joint was not run full so that the lead
drives back away from the reach of the tools the joint must be run over
again and under no circumstance in a case of this kind should a cold lead
plug be put in. If, however, there is some one point where the joint
failed to fill at the front and is filled behind it is then admissable to put
in a plug of cold lead, a chisel having been driven into the lead in the
joint to form a cavity for the union of the two pieces of lead, but a plug
should never be inserted against a flat surface of lead. It must always
go in like a wedge in order to be reliable.
THE GORDON PUMP.
This is a direct-acting duplex feed pump.

Diameters of steam cylinders, each 6 in. Diameters of water cylinder,
each 4 in. Diameters of piston rods, 1% in.
It was not possible to separate the amounts of steam used by each
pump as both exhausted into the same pipe. Nor was it possible to sep-
arate the amounts of water pumped by each as both pumped into a com-
mon pipe leading to the tower; so that the loss of action and duty of the
two pumps together are given. i
The air chamber of the pump was removed, and the valve weighed
and measured. Each pump had two suction and two exit valves, all of
brass, weighing with springs, respectively 1.88 lb., and 2.7 lb. apiece.
Only one suction and one exit valve act during one stroke. The suction
valves were directly beneath the exit valves and in opening slid up inside
of or were guided by the latter which rested, when their own springs were
not in compression, upon the suction valve springs, their weight being
just sufficient to bring them to their own seats against the force,of the suc-
tion valve springs. The exit valves were held to their seats by springs
which were thrown into compression by screwing the valve chest cover
down to its place. Each exit valve was 3J4 inches in diameter, and the
pressure required to lift it was exerted on its entire area of 8.3 sq. in. The
area of opening equalled the height of lift times the circumference of the
valve minus the width of six pieces, each 1&gt;£ inches wide, which guided
the valve into its conical seat. The net circumference then equaled


Ill
10.21" — 2" = 8.21". Each suction valve was 2% inches in diameter,
giving an area of 5.94 sq. in. to act on in lifting the valve. The suction
and delivery pipes were respectively 2% inches, and 2 inches in diameter.

The number of tests on this pump was too limited to allow many con-
clusions to be drawn from their comparison. Nos. 2 and 3 were against
the same head but with different speeds so that they may indicate, if
nothing more, what we might expect would be shown by a more extended
series of experiments.

each the average loss due to lifting the valves, there was found to be 3.03
lbs. due to friction at entrance and 0.74 lbs. due to friction at exit. The
vacuum gauge was attached to the suction pipe, however, outside the
pump, and this 3.03 lbs. includes the friction of about 2 in. of pipe, and of
one angle valve. The areas of opening in the two cases are as 1.00 to 1.90.
The velocity through the inlet valve will consequently be 1.9 times that of
the water in going out, and, if its friction vary as the square of the velocity
the friction at inlet will be 1.902 or 3.61 times that at exist, or 3.61 times
.74 = 2.67 lbs.
The balance may be due to the friction of the pipe and angle valve.
Total average loss in the pump 6.95 lbs. Total average loss of pressure
due to friction of passages 3.77 lbs.
In the two tests with the same head, the loss of action decreased very
materially with the speed.
Increasing the speed from 37.64 ft. per minute to 90.68 ft. or about 2.4
times, increased the duty from 7,845,794 to 11,734,354 or about 1.5 times.
The steam consumption per I. H. P. decreased at the same time from
229.7 lbs. to 130.8 lbs. or to about 53% of its former value. The fourth test
was condensing and compared with No. 3, which was non-condensing, had
almost the same duty as the latter, while their piston speeds were as 90 to
62. If conclusions may be drawn from such a limited amount of data, it
may be inferred that greater economy would be secured by using the
pump condensing; and that a very great saving will be effected by run-
ning at a very fast speed.
Lack of time prevented more tests being made this year on the Gor-
don pump; next year, however, the work will be continued, and an ex-
tensive series of tests will be made. The preceding matter then is not in-
tended to constitute a comparison between the Gordon and Blake pumps
as the condition of the Gordon pump tests were not such as to make it fair
to assume them as representing its best or even average performance;
while the Blake tests were made so as to see how much could be got out
of it with favorable conditions and careful attention in running.
A PECULIAR LEAK.
During the construction of a system of water works for the city of
Greenville, Michigan, a twelve inch main was laid across Flat river, and
through the lowlands adjacent on the north side it ran mostly in quick-
sand. Eighteen lengths of pipe were lowered at once by means of jack-
screws and as it was anticipated that there might be a tendency to spring


113
in^the joints, only a very light strand of yarn was used and the bell was
run full of lead and thoroughly caulked. After the pipe had been under a
pressure varying from 40 to 160 lbs. for about two months, a leak was dis-
covered near the north bank of the river by the bubbles of water arising
there. As it did not appear to be a large leak and as its repair would in-
volve quite an expenditure of time at a season when time was very
precious, it was decided to let it go till a more convenient opportunity for
repairing. For about two weeks there was no apparent change in the
quantity of water being lost, but suddenly one morning it began to boil
up furiously and with a noise that could easily be heard for twenty rods.
The effect was noticeable at the pumps and many were the conjectures as
to what had happened.
As soon as possible a gang of men were set to work to repair it. On
getting down to the pipe a stream of water perhaps equivalent to a jet
one-eighth of an inch in diameter was flowing out from the lip of the bell,
and through a hole half an inch in diameter just to one side of the top of
the pipe gallons of water were going to waste every minute. An exami-
nation developed that the water had first worked its way through a series
of blow holes in the interior of the bell—which on the exterior was appa-
rently perfectly sound—to the outer edge and was there deflected by the
lip of the bell so as to impinge upon the spigot about half an inch from
the face of the bell. This jet of water with the sand which,became
mingled with it had cut the other hole in what appeared to be perfectly
sound iron about half an inch thick and so had caused the leak which had
created such an uproar. The path of the first jet along the spigot was
marked by a groove about two and one-half inches long and three-quar-
ters wide, the hole being in the center. The edges of the hole were as
sharp as they could be imagined to be. The jet had apparently at one
time gone parallel with the axis of the pipe and at another had been de-
flected to one side at an angle of about 20 degrees starting"_from the center


The Technic.
of the hole. The piece of pipe was cut out with a two inch core drill and
is now in the possession of Mr. R. F. Sprague of Greenville, who regards
it as quite a curiosity. The hole left by the core cutter was tapped out
and an ordinary cast iron plug put in and over it a collar of 3x,^ flat iron
with a recess shaped as shown in the drawing was bolted, a part of the
lead having been previously cut out of the bell where the smaller jet had
come out and the collar crowded tight against the face of the bell. The
recess and the space in the bell which was empty was then run full of
lead at one pouring and all caulked thoroughly, and up to the present
time no more phenomena have developed in that particular locality.
It was found necessary to test the indicator springs used in the pump
tests made in the Mechanical Laboratory, as the manufacturers gave no
corrections to be applied when springs are used cold in suction and gave
them only in part for pressures. The springs tested are Thompson and
Tabor, these being the only ones used on the water ends.
To obtain the pressure correction a small platform scale was used.*

Science, ISStf.
SPRING TESTS.

It was tested with standard weights and found to weigh correctly. Its
pan was then disconnected and the beam connected to the bottom of the
indicator piston so that weights on the end of the beam threw pressure on
the spring. Before making teste, the indicator was put in position without
the spring in and the apparatus balanced. The motion of the weighing
end was magnified by a pointer whose position, when the apparatus was
balanced, was marked and called zero. The indicator with spring in was
then placed in position and the pointer was found upon repeated vibra-
tion to return to the aero. A series of observations with pressure ranging
from 0 lb. throughout the working range of the spring were then taken.
At each observation the pointer was brought back to the zero mark, and
vibrated there to insure freedom from friction: and however great the arc
of vibration it always returned to the mark. A series of such cards was
taken, the per cent, of error at each observation computed and an average
of these per cents, gave the error for the whole range. The average of the
the averages of all the cards taken are given in the table below.
In finding the suction correction, a mercury column with known cor-
rection was connected to a condenser which has a vacuum pump attached.
Upon the same pipe from the condenser connections were made so as
to attach an indicator, all joints being made as nearly air-tight as possible.
The indicator pencil was replaced by a needle point and the record of ob-
servations was a series of pricks in a vertical line in the paper. This
method obviated the necessity of moving the indicator down and would
seem to recommend itself for ease and accuracy of execution. The indi-
cator containing spring to be tested was placed in position and the vacuum
increased till mercury read about 10 lbs. when the pump was slowed to
such a speed as would about take care of such slight leaks as existed. A
prick was made for atmospheric pressure and the communication opened to
the condenser. A series of readings were then taken, one pound apart,
from nine pounds to zero. The vacuum was reduced by very slowly admitting
air through a cock. Both indicator and mercury tube were lightly tapped
during the process of a test to insure freedom of motion of piston and
mercury. The apparatus was placed so that the mercury could be read
exactly and the quickness with which pricks could be made in the card
render it probable that the readings were simultaneous. The errors were
computed and averaged as before and are tabulated below.

The results would seem to emphasize the great importance of making
.such tests of all indicator springs used in like manner.

NOTE ON BELTING.
Probably humanity will never agree as to whether a belt is more ser-
viceable with the hair side toward or away from the pulley. One class of
engineers urge that the smooth side next the pulley gives the greater
power, while another class claim that with the smooth side away from the
pulley the belt is much longer lived because when the grain is worn off
the belt is worthless. Against this it is argued that when the grain is
outside, if running over a small pulley, it tends to crack, and so the belt
becomes useless sooner than if the wear were brought upon that side.
Makers of double belts seem to take a go-between course and make their
belts with the grain out on both sides. In connection with the wearing
of double and quadruple belts a very positive evidence of the tendency to
shear lengthwise along the neutral axis is afforded, for the leather will
wear off from the two faces next each other at the center and roll itself up
in rolls which ultimately cause the belt to give way. This phenomena is
not to be found in the working of triple or quintuple belts and in the quad-
ruple is only to be noticed along the faces next the center.
G. S. Williams, '88.


The Technic has become a fixture. It is no longer an experiment.
When, a few years ago, the attempt was made to change from the form of
the Series of Selected Papers read before the Engineering Society of the Uni-
versity of Michigan, which had previously been published each year, to a
larger publication—one which would better represent the Engineering So-
ciety of the University—there were, perhaps, some apprehension as to the
result. Now there is none. The Technic board is appointed as a matter
of course, and undertakes its work confident that it will be successful,
financially and otherwise.
And having become a permanent feature of the Society it should take
permanent form, which should be changed only in details. With this idea
the present board has followed almost exactly in the steps of its prede-
cessors. It presents for a frontispiece the well-known features of Profes-
sor William H. Pettee, whose long connection with the University and in-
timate knowledge of its affairs has made him a valuable friend to the
Engineering Society; and the board takes particular pleasure in thus ex-
pressing in behalf of the Society, its appreciation of his kindly interest
in its welfare. By the variety of the subjects of the papers selected for
publication the board has endeavored to represent all branches of the en-
gineering work—Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, Mining and Sanitary. The
interior views of some of the rooms of the different laboratories and the
descriptions which follow will be new to many outside of the University
who are not aware of the amount of practical work that is being done
here. For the Engineering Society of the University of Michigan we pre-
sent for your consideration The Technic of 1890.
In the early part of the second semester Mr. E. M. Coolidge, chair-
man of The Technic board, was obliged to leave college on account of ill-
health. To be deprived thus early of the valuable guidance and help of
one so well fitted for the work was a severe loss to the board. Before
much progress had been made in the work Mr. G. M. Walker, Jr., also


The Technic.
left college, and the board was thus left without anyone who, from his
previous experience with The Technic, could direct the work. We hope,
therefore, that in reading this issue due allowance will be made for this
fact.
The Technic board wishes to call attention to its advertising pages,
which, in a publication of this kind, are among the most important—es-
pecially to the undergraduate. The educational value of such pages has
been the subject of many editorials, but we think it not yet well enough
understood. Previous boards set the example, and we have followed as
closely as possible, of advertising only first-class firms; most of them
have already an enviable reputation, and all will be found worthy of pat-
ronage.
Many facts tend to show that this year has been the most prosperous
one which the Engineering Society has passed since its organization in
1882. The hope that the active members might reach one hundred has
been more than realized, and the interest evinced in the meetings shows
that the growth has been a healthy one. At the beginning of this year
"Room 1 " was found too small to accommodate the increased numbers
and "Room A" was secured for the purpose. The scheme of having
weekly meetings, adopted last year, has proved a success from the start ,
and has greatly increased the influence of the Society by extending the
privilege of delivering a paper to a larger percentage of the members.
In this connection we might say that the papers given by under-classmen,
being of a somewhat descriptive nature, are always listened to with inter-
est by all, and are very desirable to associate with the more technical pa-
pers. A reference to the list of programs for the year will show that the
subjects have been such as to interest students in all departments of engi-
neering in the University.
When the Society was organized it was promised that if it proved
worthy a room would be furnished for its exclusive use. We can say,
without fear of successful contradiction, that in the Engineering Society
more interest is shown than in any other society in the University—but
the room cometh not. However, recognizing that the growth of the de-
partment has been such as to overcrowd nearly every room in the buildings
we endeavor to be patient. Our greatest need'at present is a better place
for our growing library and reading room, where we may also keep our
collection of photographs, models, etc.; we hope that this will be secured
before long. _


119
The usefulness of the engineering portion of the general library has
been greatly impaired by the lack of a suitable special catalogue. In
1884 a committee of the Engineering Society made a list of the books then
in the library bearing on engineering subjects, but the very large number
of books added since that time rendered this list almost valueless. In
April of this year another committee was appointed which revised the old
list, corrected the shelf numbers and added all books which .have been
received up to the present time. The catalogue thus prepared is arranged
according to subjects, and is very complete; it does credit to the commit-
tee as well as to the Society, and will undoubtedly be a great help to all
engineering students.
There is no more inspiring element in the progress of the Society than
the interest manifested in it by graduate and associate members. These
branches of the membership, established by a change of the constitution
last year, are ones which the active members are coming to depend upon
for many valuable papers. In return we desire to make The Technic of
as much interest as possible to these members, and by making it some-
what of a "Record of the work of the Engineering Department" we trust
we accomplish this object. We publish this year a list of Graduate Mem-
bers with their addresses, but the trouble experienced in getting correct
addresses for all has rendered the compiling of the list somewhat diffi-
cult. This year a plan has been found for obviating these difficulties to a
great extent: the Society has had prepared, at a considerable expense, a
register, in which to keep names and addresses of Honorary, Graduate
and Associate Members. There are few engineers who have not a more
or less permanent address through which a communication will reach
them, and it is this address which it is expected will appear in the regis-
ter, though the Society will always be ready to change it as often as re-
quested, and will always be glad to furnish the address of any member, if
possible. We hope this may prove a convenience to our absentee mem-
bers.
During the past year the equipment of the mechanical laboratory has
been still further increased through the kindness and liberality of its
friends. A Marsh Pump presented by the Battle Creek Machinery Co., a
Rider Hot Air Engineer, presented by its makers , a Buffalo
Blower, presented by the Buffalo Forge Co., a Pelton Water Motor, pre-
sented by the Pelton Motor Co., of San Francisco, three Steam Gauges,
by the Utica Steam Gauge Co., and a number of other gifts.


The Technic.
These gifts appear in two lights: One wherein the usefulness of these
machines to the student in making various tests is shown, and a second in
which there is seen a benefit to the donors in that the student, who may
become a future employer or superintendent, is familiarized with the
workings and excellencies of these gifts, and will remember these firms
when he comes to order machines of that kind. We hope that our friends
who read this will reflect upon both of these benefits, and if occasion offer
may go and do likewise.
The Technic is indebted to the following publications for the courtesy
of an exchange:
"School of Mines Quarterly," School of Mines, Columbia College;
"Technology Quarterly," Massachusetts Institute of Technology; "The
Stevens Indicator," Stevens Institute of Technology, "Journal of the En-
gineering Society of Lehigh University," "Journal of. the Association of
Engineering Societies," proceedings of the "Engineering Society of the

gineer's Club," University of Illinois; Selected Papers of " The Rensselaer

Arkansas, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa and Michigan.

138 of these Justly Celebrated Engines Now in Use and Under Contract. Average Daily Capacity of each 5,000,000 Gals.
Its Record Unparalleled. Consider the Points which Demonstrate It.
1. The first Gaskill crank and fly-wheel pumping engine was built and
put in service at Saratoga Springs, N. Y., in 1882, nine years ago.
2. Since that time 130 of these engines have been constructed or con-
tracted for, an average of about 15 a year.
3. The duty of the first engine of this kind at Saratoga, on contract
test, was 112,899,983 foot-pounds for 100 pounds of coal consumed.
4. The average duty of above engine in current service from 1884 to
1890, inclusive—seven years—was 105,524,137 foot-pounds from coal actually
consumed.
5. During the above interval of six years the cost of repairs was less
than $100, as certified by officials in charge.
6. Another engine of the same type, of 8,000,000 gallons daily capac-
ity, was constructed for Saratoga Springs, and tested and accepted in Octo-
ber, 1889. The duty obtained was 113,378,479 foot-pounds from coal con-
sumed, and 117,936,698 on an evaporation of ten to one.
7. Other engines of the same type, in number about forty, have been
tested by some of the most eminent engineers of the United States, all of
them developing high duty beyond all former precedent; and at Dayton,
O., eclipsing 10,000,000 engines in a duty of 124,782,157 foot pounds on a
ratio of ten to one evaporation.
8. The capacity of these engines manufactured thus far ranges from
1,000,000 to 20,000,000 gallons daily.
9. They are in use in Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Buffalo, Wash-
ington, Kansas City, Omaha, Denver, Portland, Oregon, and other large
cities in the United States.
10. In symmetry of proportion, weight, strength, economy, durability
and price, comparison is challenged with any other engine manufactured in
this or any other country.
11. A book of 230 pages, illustrated with 43 cuts and diagrams of en-
gines and indicator cards, with full official reports of duty tests of 27 Gas-
kill pumping engines by about thirty mechanical experts, eminent in their
profession, will be mailed upon application to all who are interested in, or
may have occasion to purchase, pumping engines. The book demonstrates
beyond all dispute that the Gaskill compound crank and fly-wheel pump-
ing engines, manufactured under patents of the Holly Manufacturing Co.,
far surpass any other engines manufactured in the world.

PROFESSOR JOSEPH BAKER DAVIS, C. E,
BY M. W. HARRINGTON.
Professor Davis is of true New England descent. His ancestors were
among the early settlers of Eastern Massachusetts. His grand-father,
Joseph Davis, was a blacksmith and master of his trade, and he taught
the same trade to his son, Ebenezer H., the father of the subject of this
sketch. Ebenezer became in time the person to whom was intrusted
the tempering of tools in a farm-tool factory of considerable size. The
tempering of tools always requires skill and experience, but in those
days, now forty or more years ago, it was an especially difficult matter
because of the imperfections of the steel. The picks from this factory
were taken to California soon after the discovery of gold there and they
stood so well the hard usage they received that they became favorites
with the miners, and the factory had to run day and night to supply the
demands of the California market. Ebenezer Davis afterwards became
a ship-rigger at New Bedford, when this was the greatest whaling port
in the world. He became as much a master of this business as he had
been of the other and it was said of him that he could plan the rigging
of the largest vessel so exactly that not a yard of rope would be left over.
In later life he retired to a farm in North Dartmouth, Mass., and here he
is still living at the age of seventy-five years.
Professor Davis was born in Westport, Mass., in 1845. His mother


The Technic.
was Mehitable C. Gifford .Davis, who died when he was but seven months
old. Family tradition represents her as a woman of unusually amiable
and attractive character. The infant child was reared by a cousin of
his grandfather, a maiden lady and member of the Society of Friends.
This was Miss Anstrus Baker, one of the calm, prudent Quaker type,
whose steady character, unswerving devotion to duty and good deeds had
given her judgment unusual weight in the family. He had been named
Joseph Davis, after his grandfather, but when he passed into the charge
of Miss Baker her family name was added to his. Her influence over
him, acquired while he was very young, remained unchanged through
her life. After he left home he kept up a correspondence with her, and
when she died, he traveled over a thousand miles to attend her funeral.
In her later years, her straight figure, her calm, pure face, her white hair,
and her quaint and severe Quaker garb, made her an attractive and strik-
ing personage.
Mr. Davis's childhood was spent in the surroundings of the respect-
able poverty of earlier New England. It was a poverty which was pecul-
iarly wholesome for mind and body, and from which has been derived
much of the vigor and thrift of the nation. He began his school life be-
fore the age of four. The typical school house and teacher of the sterile
farming districts of New England were so picturesque that their features
have not escaped the writers of romance. A single room, abundance and
variety of corporal punishment, the headlong sports of healthy and happy
boys and girls, fresh air with no need of ventilating apparatus, woods
and waters, form a picture which from time to time comes back to many
of the middle-aged workers in office or class-room all over the country.
To these there is to be added, for south-eastern Massachusetts, visions of
winding' country roads, bits of fields hemmed in by stone walls, decidu-
ous woods with an undergrowth like hair, or pine-woods, free, open and
fragrant,—brooks, old beaver-dams, ponds, cranberry marshes, hucklef
berry patches, mills turned by rock-channelled streams, abundance c-
spring flowers often very beautiful, sheltered skating nooks with rally-
ing fires on the ice, and abundant other features, each in its season, all
attractive to an active, healthy boy. Their very poverty added a charm
to their lives for it held them nearer to Nature's bosom. Homage to
money was unknown and character was the only criterion for respect in
these rural districts. To these features we have to add, in this case two
others. The members of his family were Friends or closely associated
with them, and his residence in or near New Bedford brought him into
close contact with those occupied in marine pursuits. In those days
whale-fishing was yet pursued with great activity, and the center of this
activity was in south-eastern Massachusetts. Whale-fishing is a pictur-
esque and fascinating trade, and its influence on the imagination of a
young boy must always be notable. Mr. Davis's reminiscences are always
full of pictures of whale-fishing.


3
He remained in New Bedford until 1863, when his father purchased a
farm a few miles out from this place. From here the father used to go
into the city on business, and here young Davis spent the last year with
his father's family.
In 1864, he presented himself among the crowd of expectant freshmen
asking admission to the University of Michigan. He was admitted, and
graduated, in the class of 1868—a class which has left more of its members
in the University faculty than any other class ever graduated there. In
his University course, Mr. Davis's work was marked by the characteristics
which have marked his life since. His sterling manliness and loyalty to his
convictions gave him the thorough respect and confidence of his instructors
and classmates. His means were limited, and, in addition to the work
which he performed with his classmates, he had also to provide for his
own subsistence. This he did in such a way that his standing as a stu-
dent did not suffer. His genuine ability, his sturdy conscientiousness in his
work, and his unremitting industry, overcame all obstacles, and kept him
among the first in anunusally strong class. Meantime, in allmatters of col-
lege or class politics, his fellow students were never in doubt as to where
Davis would stand. His strong common sense, with a tincture of Quaker-
ism, was always his guide. His classmates well remember the thickset,
strong, good-natured, deep-voiced, and fair young man, plainly dressed,
unpretentious, hearty in his bearing, and loyal to his class and to his
friends. In those closely associated with him at this time, he aroused a
feeling of affection which was founded on a basis of respect and confi-
dence. There is no sentiment that is more enduring than an affection
built on such a foundation. It can only be changed by the conviction that
the foundation is unsafe. In this case the sentiment has remained un-
changed through the quarter of a century which has elapsed since the
sturdy young Davis used to occupy the seat of a student.
In the summer of i867 and therefore while yet a student,Mr.Davis spent
the summer on Lake Superior, in the employ of the United States Lake Sur-
vey. The season was spent on the Portage entry base-line, on a harbor sur-
vey at Chocolet river, on shore-line and inland surveys, and on sound-
ings. In those days, members of the senior class in the University finished
their college work at class day, then a month earlier than commencement.
Mr. Davis did not wait during this month to enjoy his new-found ease but
went at once to Detroit where he served in various capacities in the City
Engineer's office and as draftsman in an architect's office. Indoor work,
however, did not agree with him and he soon accepted a position on the
Missouri Eiver, Fort Scott &amp; Gulf railroad. He went to Kansas in the
autumn of 1868 and was occupied with the preliminary surveys and loca-
tion of this road. He was here under the well-known engineer, Mr.
Octave Chanute,who built the Kansas City bridge over the Missouri river,
—a feat considered impossible not ten years before it was done. Mr.


The Technic.
Davis had the good fortune to obtain Mr. Chanute's entire confidence and
esteem.
In June, 1869, he returned to Michigan and during the summer and
autumn was occupied in running a railroad line from Owosso to Big Rap-
ids,—a distance of about ninety miles. On the completion of these surveys
he returned to Massachusetts after an absence of six years.
In 1870, at the beginning of the second semester, Mr. Davis was invited
to take a temporary position of instructor in the department of civil engi-
neering. At the end of the college year he accepted employment on the
Toledo and Ann Arbor railroad, and during the summer he made the loca-
tion surveys for this line. This line was first straight from city to city but,
a bad place having been found in its course, a small angle was introduced
to avoid this. Later he was made chief assistant engineer for the North-
ern extension of the Jackson, Lansing and Saginaw railroad. He made the
exploratory surveys from Bay City to Gaylord, and the location surveys
to Grayling.
In the autumn of 1871 he went to Swarthmore, Penn., to organize the
Civil Engineering course in the Friends' college at that place. In June,
1872, he was made assistant professor of Civil Engineering in the Univer-
sity of Michigan, and he has held that position to the present time with
great satisfaction to the University and to his pupils. In July, 1872, he
married Miss Mary Hubbard Baldwin, daughter of Deacon J. D. Baldwin,
of Ann Arbor. Three children have been born to them but only one
survives.
A large part of Mr. Davis's professional activity has been spent in teach-
ing; in fact, with the exception of a year or so, he has been teaching ever
since he graduated. During this time a very large number have passed out
from under his instruction to their professional duties. They look back with
both respect and affection to their instructor, and with good reason; for,
aside from those qualities of head and heart to which I have already re-
ferred, and which command these sentiments, he brought to his work as
teacher a thorough knowledge of his subject and a conscientiousness
and painstaking which would permit no member of his class to slur
over his work, or to think himself well prepared when he was not.
Mr. Davis insists on as good, accurate, thorough, and honest work on the
part of his pupils as he would perform himself, and he often calls their
attention to what might be called the ethical side of the profession.
Lives and property depend on the honesty and knowledge of the engineer
and architect, and an engineer who undertakes work for which he ia not
competent, betrays the confidence of his employers, and may be punished
by law. Thorough and conscientious work must always be done, and
this wholesome lesson Mr. Davis especially impresses on his pupils.
Professor Davis has written but little; he has been too busy. Nor
has he sought honors or employment, but has waited for them to come


5
to him. In addition to his duty as teacher, he has had as many profes-
sional labors as he could attend to, and he has kept up his practice as
engineer and surveyor. He was made City Engineer of Ann Arbor many
years ago, without solicitation, and while seven hundred miles away;
and, through all the vicissitudes of local politics, he retained this
position for sixteen years when he resigned it and his assistant was made
his successor. During this time he fixed our levels and grades, set the
necessary monuments and made records of them, attended to gutters,
crossings and similar matters until the city is now one of the best cared
for of its size in the country. In 1874, he became a Junior in the Ameri-
can Society of Civil Engineers, and he remains in that grade to this day,
probably the Junior of the longest standing on the list. In 1883, he was
made president of the Michigan Engineering Society, and held the posi-
tion for three consecutive terms. He has also been a consulting engi-
neer for the Flint and Pere Marquette railroad and still holds this relation
with the Toledo, Ann Arbor and Northern Michigan railroad. He was
for two years vice-president of the "Council of Engineering Societies on
National Public Works." He has interested himself especially in high-
way and railroad bridges and many have been built according to his de-
signs. He has also made a study of the problems of waterworks for
cities, and those at Greenville, Mich., built at a cost of $45,000, are a
standing illustration of the effectiveness, thoroughness, and economy of
his plans. A somewhat similar history applies to the waterworks of
Owosso. He takes, apparently, especial interest in that difficult, time-
consuming and exasperating duty of surveyors,—that of finding missing
corners,—and to this he brings to bear an amount of tact and experience
rarely found elsewhere, and a willingness to expend more labor than
most surveyors are willing to put on it. The result is that with him lost
corners are always found, if they are actually in existence, and with the
finding of them comes the definite and authentic settlement of bounda-
ries so necessary to the comfort of land-owners.


The Technic .
CALORIMETRY, OR METHODS OP FINDING THE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE
IN STEAM,
BY R. C. CARPENTER, M. M. E.
CLASS OF '75,
Steam may exist in three conditions, first in a gaseous condition, in
which no moisture is present, second in its normal condition, in which case
a certain amount of moisture exists in the form of vapor, third in a condi-
tion or form in which it may be loaded with drops or vapor of water. The
first condition can be detected by the fact that as compared with the
second or third conditions, the pressure remaining the same, the tempera-
ture is more or less elevated, and steam in this condition is termed super-
heated, in the second or normal condition it is termed dry and saturated,
while in the third condition it is termed wet and is to be regarded as
made up of a mixture of water and dry and saturated steam. It is essen-
tial that these three conditions of steam be clearly in mind in comparing
the various operations employed in calorimetry.
The methods of measuring the amount of moisture contained in steam,
may be considered under three heads, first, Calorimetry Proper, in which
the method is based on some process of comparing the heat actually ex-
isting in a pound of the sample, with that known to exist in a pound or
equal amount of dry and saturated steam at the same pressure. Second,
Mechanical separation of the water from the steam, and a process of
weighing each component. Third, a Chemical Method, which introduces
some soluble salt into the water of a boiler, that is not volatized ami car-
ried off' by dry steam, and the amount of entwined water in a given sample
of steam, is the ratio of that found in equal weights of condensed steam
and of water drawn from the boiler.
The importance of calorimetry in Steam Engineering is great because
the per cent, of water carried over in the steam in the form of vapor or
drops of water may be large, and this water is an inert quantity so far as
its power of doing work is concerned, even if not a positive detriment to
the engine. Any tests for the efficiency of engine or boiler but not ac-
companied with calorimetric determinations of the amount of water car-
ried over in the steam, would be defective in essential particulars
and might lead to erroneous or even absurd results. On the other hand
if the steam is super-heated, it becomes important to determine, tlieexcesa


7
of heat which it holds, otherwise equally absurd conclusions may be
drawn for opposite reasons.
The methods of determining the exact condition of the steam be-
comes then of great practical importance, since only by knowing its con-
dition can the amount of heat that the steam carries be determined.
Calorimetry Proper, as the nani3 implies, is a process of determining the
amount of heat in a given weight, and then by comparison with the heat,
known to exist in dry and saturated steam of the same wyeight, the condi-
tion or quality of the steam may be computed.
STEAM TABLES.
The normal amount of heat contained in steam, is given in Steam
Tables, all of which are founded upon the extensive experiments made by
Regnault, at the expense of the French government, and published in
1841. The accuracy of these experiments has never been called in
question, but as Regnault's determinations were made with French
weights and thermometers, there has been some question and some disa-
greement as to the accuracy of these results reduced to English denom-
inations. So far as the author is able to determine there are three sets
of tables, in English measures, derived independently from Regnault's
observations; of these the latest, and perhaps the most carefully con-
structed one, is by Prof. 0. H. Peabody, of Boston; another one made
with great care by Chas. T. Porter, is generally considered the standard in
this country; still another, Clark's tables are extensively reprinted in
this country and form the basis of most of the ordinary tables. These
differ a sensible amount from the later and more accurate tables of Pea-
body. Besides these, and derived from them, are tables by R. H. Buel,
published in "Weisbach's Steam Engine" and in Prof. Thurston's works,
and tables in Nystrom's hand book, which agree very closely with Pea-
body's tables, and are presumably quite accurate.
In all the steam tables the unit of heat is the amount required to
raise one pound of water, one degree Fah. in Temperature, and this is
termed a British Thermal Unit (B. T. U.)
The importance of accurate steam tables, can hardly be over esti-
mated since they form the basis of all computations as to the condition or
quality of steam. The specific heat of steam at atmospheric pressure, was
determined by Regnault from the mean of three not very accordant ob-
servations, as 0.878, and this, later observations have shown to be substan-
tially correct. This would indicate that a British Thermal Unit would
raise one pound of steam (1 divided by 0.878) 2.64 degrees in temperature.
The heat shown by steam of a given pressure in excess of that indicated
by the steam tables for that pressure, is the degree of superheat and this
can be reduced to B. T. U. by multiplying by the value of the specific

in which case it is usually expressed in degrees of superheat, by dividing
the excess above 100 by 0.48, the specific heat of steam. The quality of
steam is denoted by x in all formulas relating to calorimetry.
PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS AND SYMBOLS USED.
In the use of the steam tables, please notice that the pressures used
are absolute pressures, and are equal to gauge readings plus the barome-
ter readings reduced to pounds. The barometer reading in inches of
mercury may be reduced to pounds per square inch by dividing by 2.037.
The heat of the liquid is frequently used instead of the temperature;
this differs from temperature by the correction for work of expansion and
in being reckoned from 32° instead of 0.

Tables, will be used:

The quantities, S, I, E, L, and H, are expressed in British Thermal
Units (B. T. U.) for one pound of the steam, and the determinations made

CALORIMETRY PROPER.
The operations for determining the amount of moisture in steam de-
pend on the fact that the total amount of heat in a B. T. U. remains the
same, since no work is done, during all changes in pressure or con-
dition of the steam. By some change in the condition of steam, the B.
T. U. in a given weight of the steam is obtained at a known pressure;
rom this may be calculated the heat and consequent moisture in the
steam at the original pressure. The heat taken up by the calorimeter
should be obtained and corrections made for the same. The B. T. U. above
32° in one pound of steam can be expressed by the formula Lx + S, and
above zero by Lx + T, in which x equals the percentage of dry steam.
CONDENSING CALORIMETERS.
In order to determine the amount of heat in a given, weight of steam,
two operations may be performed; first, it may be condensed at atmos-
pheric pressure, and the weight of steam found by taking weights before
and after the steam has been condensed. Call the original weight of
the water. W, of the condensed steam w, original temperature of the
water t, final temperature t'.


9
The heat added to the water by condensing one pound of steam
would be W (t' — t) ■+■ w) and this would equal the loss of heat by the
steam Lx + T — t'.
Neglecting the effect of the calorimeter
Lx + T-t' =W (f —t) h- w.
From this,
W
(f - t) - (T - t')
w
which equation applies to all calorimeters in which the heat is formed by
condensing the steam, L and T being taken from steam tables for steam
at the origiual pressure, and as obtained by adding the barometer pres-
sure to that shown by the steam gauge.
SUPERHEATING CALORIMETERS.
Second, the exact heat in a pound of steam can be determined by the
thermometer, provided the steam has a higher temperature than that due
to its pressure. If the specific heat of steam be assumed 0.48, and the
reading of the thermometer T", the degree of superheat is T' — T, which,
reduced to B. T. U., equals 0.48 (T — T), so that the total heat units con-
tained in one pound of the steam is equal to
H + 0.48 (T - T).
Two calorimeters have been devised on this principle: the superheat-
ing calorimeter by Barrus, in which the heat is supplied by extraneous
means, and the throttling calorimeter of Peabody, in which the heat re-
quired for superheating is obtained by reducing the pressure, which, be-
ing accompanied by a corresponding reduction of boiling point, liberates
heat sufficient to evaporate a small percentage of moisture.
CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE ACCURACY OF CALORIMETERS.
First those Calorimeters that Condense the Steam.—To determine the
effect of error, suppose in each case the quantity under discussion to be
a variable and differentiate:
W
-(t'-t) — (Tp-f)
w
x —
Lp
We have dx -h dW = (f — t) ■*■ wLp .
dx -f- dw = — (W -f- w« ) (f — t) Lp .
dx-f-dt= ((W-f- w) + 1) -s-Lp.
dx -f- dt' = W + wLp.
dx dP = — (W w) (f —t) s- L2 — (L + T — t') -s- L* ,
approximately, since P is a known function of both L and T. In actual
cases, the values will not differ greatly from the following: w = 20, W=

300 to 400, so that the ratio of W h- w = 15 to 22; t' — t = 50° to 70°; t' = 110°
to 120°; t = 50° to 60°; L = 900 to 870; T = 290° to 350°.
From these average values the effect of given errors can be computed,
and will be about as follows:

To keep the error of the calorimeter at one-half per cent, or less, the
errors in the weights of either cold or warm water must not exceed one-
half of one per cent., which is one-tenth of a pound for 20 pounds in
weight, or \% to 2 pounds for 300 to 400 pounds in weight, and the corres-
ponding errors in temperature and must not exceed one-fifth degree F.
The error in gauge pressure should not exceed 1% pounds. To keep the
error within one-tenth of one per cent, in the result, correspondingly ac-
curate weights and temperatures must be taken.
Conditions for determination of moisture within one-half of one per
cent, require,
1st. Scales that weigh accurately to half of one per cent, of the quan-
tity to be weighed.
2d. Thermometers that give accurate determinations to one-fifth
degree F.
3d. An accurate pressure gauge.
4th. Correct observations of the resulting quantities.
5th. Determination of radiation loss caused by Calorimeter.
Second class of calorimeters, in wliich the steam is superheated. First,
the Harms Superheating Calorimeter: In this, if t.i—ti is the gain of
temperature in the live steam pipe, and t2 —13 is the loss of temperature
in the superheated steam, we have neglecting radiation.
1—x= .48 [t» — ts — (t4 — ti )] + L


11
In the Throttling Calorimeter, where the steam is superheated by ex-
panding, we have,
x=[H + .48 (f — t) — 8] -!- L
In both the above, the effect of an error of one degree in temperature
is to make an error in x of .06 of one per cent., while an error of 9 degrees
in temperature will effect the value of x but %. Per cent. The boiling
point should be correctly determined, however, especially if the amount
of superheating is small.
The effect of an error in gauge reading of one pound will make one-
half the error as with the other class of calorimeters.
SPECIAL FORMS OF CALORIMETERS.
The Barrel or Tank Calorimeter.—This consists of an ordinary wooden
tank or barrel, resting on a pair of scales. The scales should be gradu-
ated to read to one-tenth of a pound. A thermometer is necessary read-
ing to one-fifth of a degree, with a range from 32° to 150°. Steam gauge
is to be attached on main pipe near where steam is taken oft'. Take steam
from main pipe by means of a nipple extending well into the pipe. This
may be conveyed into the barrel in a hose, but as this is likely to with-
draw more or less water, when taken out after use, and as a very small
error in weight in that event would make a serious error in the result it is
recommended that the connection to the barrel be partlv bv hose and
partly by iron pipe. The hose is to terminate in an iron pipe, on which
is screwed a crosstee or branch pipes; an air valve is to be put in this
pipe higher than water line of the barrel. When in use this is to be sup-
ported on a bracket so as to remain in the barrel, but not in contact with
the sides. It is to be in position during the operation of weighing, with
the air cock open, and corrections to the weight must be made for the
displacement of water, by the pipe. Pipe and hose connection should be
three-fourths of an inch in diameter.
Formula for quality of steam:
W + K G
Then x L= (f — t) — (Tp —t').
w
in which W w is the ratio of cold water to condensed steam; these
quantities are obtained by successive weighings; t' — t is the gain in tem-
perature of the water in the barrel due to condensing the steam; Tp is the
original temperature of the steam ; Lp its latent heat; K G the radiating
and absorption effect of the barrel on the resulting temperature.
The effect of the calorimeter, is reduced, to an equivalent amount
of condensing water, termed the water equivalent, which is nearly equal
to the specific heat of the calorimeter multiplied by its weight. Thus let
letK be the specific heat, G the weight of the calimeter.
To find the equivalent loss due to the barrel: The effect of this ab-
sorption of heat is to lower the resulting temperature of the water, and is


The Technic.
due in part to absorption by the sides of the barrel, and in part to radiation
into the air. This value is for a wooden barrel, very small, especially if it
bo previously heated, and if the temperature of the water be raised as
much above that of the air in the room as the cold water was below; in
this last case it is less than the errors from ordinary observations, and
may be neglected as insensible.
To find K, make repeated observations with steam of same quality,
and with the same range of temperatures and pressures, as nearly as pos-
sible; equate these various values and solve for K.
USE OP THE BARREL CALORIMETER.
The barrel calorimeter has been given an important position in this
discussion, because it is considered by many engineers, to be the most
valuable'and important method of determining the amount of moisture
in steam. A consideration, however, of the errors produced by erroneous
temperature determinations, of a slight amount or by exceeding small
errors in weight of the condensed steam, indicates that under the con-
ditions of use in an actual boiler trial, the errors would be very great.
As a matter of fact, under the best conditions that can be secured in a
laboratory, the probable error of a single observation will, from our ex-
perience, exceed two per cent, and the best results from a number of
observations is likely to be in error fully one-half per cent. The results
that can be secured in a boiler-room at an actual trial, are presumably
not as good as those to be had in a laboratory, and it is quite certain from
the varying character of the results given that the probable error is fully
twice or three times that given above.
KENT AND HOODLEY CALORIMETERS.
To insure more accurate results in the weight of the condensed
steam, both Mr. Hoodley and Mr. Kent used, with different details of
construction, a coil or worm in which to condense the steam. This con-
densed steam was weighed separately from the condensing water and
on a finer and more accurate pair of scales, thus securing greater accur-
acy in weight of the condensed steam. This method did not, however,
improve the methods nor reduce the uncertainty of measuring the tem-
perature of the condensing water, so that it is difficult to see in just what
way the probable error would be reduced.
THE CONTINUOUS CALORIMETERS.
The continuous calorimeters belong to the same class as the one just
described; they differ in the fact that the calorimeter acts continuously
by condensing the steam with a jet or surface condenser. The advantage
presented over the barrel calorimeter lies principally in the fact that bet-
ter opportunities are [presented for measuring the temperatures. The
same conditions as to errors in weights and temperatures exist as with


13
the barrel calorimeter; that is to bring resulting error within one-half of
one per cent., weights must be within one-half of one per cent., and tem-
peratures must be accurate to one-fifth of one degree.
The same formula modified slightly can be used as for the barrel cal-
orimeter.
The Barrus continuous calorimeter consists of a tub, in which is
placed a brass coil; this brass coil is connected below the tub with a
drum carrying a water gauge glass; below this is a cock connecting with
a cooling coil in a bucket of water. The steam is connected directly to
the brass coil, and is condensed by cold water flowing through the tub;
this condensed steam falls into the pipe with the water gauge glass, when
it can be drawn off, keeping the water level in the gauge glass constant;
it is still farther cooled in the bucket of water, and is drawn off in a
pail, and can be weighed at the end of the run. The condensing water
flows past a thermometer, in a thermometer cup, as it enters the tub, and
again as it leaves; the difference in the readings of these two thermome-
ters will be the gain t' — t of the condensing water. This condensing
water is caught and weighed for the same period as the condensed steam,
and gives the value of W. It presents the advantage over the barrel cal-
orimeter of keeping the condensed steam separate from the condensing
water, and thus reduces the liability of error in weighing; it is, however,
a complex instrument, aud must be handled with care. It is valuable
principally from its historical associations.
The coil-continuous calorimeter, as designed by the author, is a mod-
ification of the Hoodley calorimeter, and consists of a condensing coil
inclosed within an iron casing; the condensed steam is drawn off below,
and by means of a water guage glass can be kept at a constant level; this
is passed through a cooling pipe, as in the Barrus calorimeter. The con-
densing water is received at the bottom of the condenser and discharged
at the top; its temperature is taken as it enters and as it leaves. The
radiation loss of the main condenser can be neglected if the temperature
of the entering water be as much below as that of the discharge water is
above the temperature of the room. The radiation from the pipe below
the condenser can be corrected as explained in the directions. It is much
simpler in form than the Barrus, and not as liable to leak and overflow.
Mr. Barus advises, that a radiation run be made by filling the con-
denser with wool or felt instead of waste, and weighing the steam con-
densed for the same time as is used in making a run. This amount is to
be deducted from the weight of condensed steam—from our own trials,
we find this quantity is very small and the errors caused by neglecting it
are much less than the error of the instrument. If we denote this quan-
tity by u, and the temperature of the steam as it leaves the calorimeter
by t", other symbols as before, we have as the formula for the quality:

The Technic.
Jet-Condenser Calorimeter.—The continuous calorimeters just described
are all of the surface condenser pattern. A jet-condenser calorimeter has
been used by the writer with good results. The condenser was con-
structed out of a small injector; the water was supplied from a tank on a
pair of scales, and the weights were taken before and after condensation
of steam. The temperatures were measured before and after condensa-
tion of steam.
THE SUPERHEATING CALORIMETERS.
These are of two kinds, the Barrus Superheating and Throttling.
In the Barrus Superheating Calorimeter the steam pipe leading from
the main is bifurcated, one branch passing over the flames of a large
bunsen burner, the other passing upward and finally downward, when it
is jacketed by the enlargement of the first branch. The branches dis-
charge separately, each through equal orifices, about one-eighth inch in
diameter.
The theory of the calorimeter is as follows:
1st. Equal weights of steam flow through either branch of the pipe.
2d. The steam, superheated by the gas flame, is used as a jacket for
the other branch, and parts with as much heat, except for radiation, as
the other gains.
3d. This amount may be measured provided the discharged steam
from the central tube is superheated.
To measure this gain or loss of heat, thermometers are placed to take
the temperature of steam as it enters and leaves the jacket, and on cen-
tral pipe near same places.
Formula—Let (i—x) be the amount of water to be evaporated; in so
doing it will take up from the jacket steam L (i—x) heat units. Let T be
the normal temperature of the steam at the gauge pressure; Ti be the
temperature of the superheated jacket steam at entering, and Tj as it
leaves; let Ts be the temperature of the superheated steam from the
main pipe, and let radiation loss be r expressed in degrees F. Then if
specific heat steam be 0.48, since gain and loss of heat is equal, we have,
.48 (Ti — Tj — r) = L (i—x) + .48 (T—T3 )
.-. i—x = .48 [Ti — T2 — r —(T — T3) ] ■+■ L
From which x may be found.
To find r, the radiation loss, shut off steam in the branch leading to
the center steam pipe, and find reading of thermometers Ti and T2 ; after
a run of equal length take r = Ti — Tj. This instrument, although com-
plicated and difficult to work, will give results accurate to one-fourth per
cent, in the quality.
THE THROTTLING CALORIMETER.
This instrument was designed in 1888 by Prof. C. H. Peabody, oi
Boston, and represents the greatest step heretofore made in practical cal-
orimetry. The equations for its use and limitations of the same were


15
given by Prof. Peabody in Vol. IX, Reports American Society Mechanical
Engineers. As designed originally, it consisted of a small vessel, four
inches in diameter by six to eight inches long, and connected to the steam
supply with a pipe containing a .valve; there was also a valve in the ex-
haust pipe. The calorimeter was provided with pressure gauge and means
of measuring the temperature. In the use of the calorimeter, the steam
pressure in the calorimeter was maintained at some point lower than that
in the main by throttling the supply and exhaust valve at some point
lower than that in the main steam pipe, when, if the moisture in the
steam was not excessive, the thermometer in the calorimeter would show
superheat, or a higher temperature than that due to its pressure. If the
moisture was excessive so that the steam in the calorimeter was not
superheated, it could not be used.
In the practical use of the calorimeter, it was discovered that the rad-
iation loss became less, somewhat in proportion as the radiating surface
was decreased, and also probably as the supply of steam was increased.
This fact led Prof. Peabody to propose the use of standard orifice, through
which the steam must flow to be throttled, and also the addition of a
separating chamber when the range of the instrument was insufficient
without it.
One form of this instrument, as designed by Mr. Heisler, is exceed-
ingly compact, small, and finely finished, and is now on the market as a
commercial instrument. A form designed of pipe fittings is used princi-
pally in the laboratory, and consists of one three-quarter tee, into the top
of which a thermometer cup is screwed, and into the bottom a short nip-
ple; into the side opening is screwed a wooden bushing and a three-
eighths nipple; on the end of the nipple is a cap in which is drilled a
hole one-eighth or one-sixteenth inch in diameter, through which the
steam is throttled. An air cock on the side of calorimeter affords an op-
portunity for attaching a manometer to measure the pressure in the
calorimeter.
The equation for its use is as follows: The heat in one pound of steam
before passing into the calorimeter is that due to the steam pressure, and
is x L + S; this is equal to that of one pound of steam at the pressure
due to calorimeter pressure plus .48 of the amount of superheat,
or, x L + S = Hc + .48 (T — Tc)
In which L equals latent heat and S equals sensible heat, due to pressure
in main pipe to be found in steam tables.
Hc = total heat in one pound of dry steam at calorimeter pressure;
T' — reading of thermometer in calorimeter, and Tc = normal tempera-
ture of steam in calorimeter due to calorimeter pressure. Care must be
taken that both H and S are reckoned from 32°.
In the ordinary use of this instrument, it delivers steam at atmos-


The Technic.
pheric pressure, so that the normal temperature in the calorimeter is 212°
and Hc is 1146.6, in which case
_1146.6 + .48 (T — 212) — S
X~ L
_ 1146.6 — S .48 (T'—212)
L L
If in this form we suppose the steam pressure constant, and the de-
gree of superheat and quality of steam alone to vary, L and S will both be
constant, and we shall have the equatation of a right line in which
1146.6 .g ^j)e distance above the origin that the line cuts the axis of
Li
ordinates, and .48 -r- L is the tangent of the angle that the line makes
with the axis of abscissas. Drawing lines corresponding to the different
gauge or absolute pressures a chart may be formed very convenient for
obtaining values of x without calculation. A chart formed in a similar
manner with degrees of superheat in the calorimeter as abscissa and
absolute steam pressure as ordinates, gives us a series of moisture curves,
and forms a chart more convenient for calculation than the first described.
The amount of steam that,will flow through the orifice at each pres-
sure should be known; it may be weighed by condensing the steam, or
computed by Napier's formula that the flow in pounds per second = PA
-K70, in which P = absolute pressure and A = area in square inches of
orifice.
The limiting amount of moisture that can be determined by the throt-
tling calorimeter is given as follows by Peabody:

There is some loss by radiation with this instrument and this loss
produces a sensible effect on the reading of the thermometer, unless the
flow of steam is very great. This quantity can be determined by attach-
ing the calorimeter to steam that is known to be dry and saturated, or to
steam that is superheated slightly by a flame, and of which the pressure
and temperature, and corresponding quality is known. The loss of tem-
perature by radiation can be determined in this manner, and this result
can be used as a constant correction.


17
In the use of thermometer cups, screwed into the steam, it is essen-
tial that they be filled with mercury or cylinder oil, and that no moisture
or waste cotton be in contact with the bulb of the thermometer, it is also
essential that the cup dips fairly and fully into the line of blowing steam.
The experience of the writer, from a single experiment gives the same
results with the thermometers immersed in cups filled with oil, as im-
mersed in the steam itself.
PRACTICAL USE OF THE THROTTLING CALORIMETER.
An extended use of this instrument, has convinced me that for a
quality of steam for which it is adapted, no instrument yet devised can
equal it in accuracy or convenience. It is eminently portable, as its total
weight need not exceed two pounds, and its extreme dimensions may be
less than one foot, it is easily constructed, and its total cost need not
exceed, without valves and thermometer cup, 50 cents. By consulting the
remarks regarding effect of errors it will be seen that, a thermometer
graduated once in two degrees, will give determinations correct to nearly
one-tenth of one per cent, and as no weighings are required, no errors
for weights have to be considered. The effect of errors in pressure gauge
of one pound is about equal that of two degrees on the thermometer, and
has one-half the effect as in the condensing calorimeters. I consider that
a single observation taken with calibrated instruments is not subject to a
probable error exceeding one-tenth of one per cent., provided its radiation
loss be determined and corrected for.
The computation of percentage of moisture can be done by inspection
and from a chart constructed as explained, as accurately as required for
practical purposes.
BARRUS UNIVERSAL CALORIMETER.
Filed Nov. 30, 1888, Patented In 1889.
This instrument consists of the combination of a separating chamber,
with a throttling calorimeter. If the steam is not too wet, the separating
chamber is removed and the throttling calorimeter used only. If the
steam is very wet the separating chamber is also used; this contains at
its lower part a water gauge glass, and all the water thrown down is
drawn out and weighed. The amount of steam passing through the in-
strument is calculated by Napier's formula, Q = -7La- PA, in which Q = the
weight of water discharged in pounds each second, P = the absolute
pressure, A = the area in square inches, or condensed and weighed; call
the weight of the separated water W; the weight of steam passing w.
The per cent, of moisture taken out by the separator = W -5- (w + W).
The steam passing the separator flows into the throttling calorimeter,
from which its quality can be ascertained as explained. The total
2


The Technic.
amount of moisture in the steam is equal to that shown by the throt-
tling calorimeter, added to that given by the separator.
t _ v _- W [L + S—H —.48 (T' — Te)] w
W +. w L W + w
Radiation corrections to this instrument are essential to accurate de-
terminations, especially when the separating portion is used, as this
amount is frequently one or two per cent of the steam discharged, and in
reality constitutes the principal source of error. The instrument without
a separator is a mere throttling calorimeter, and subject to the same
errors and limitations; with the separator attached, the accuracy depends
on first, the correct calculation of the flow of steam through a stan-
dard orifice, of known area, this result should certainly be checked by
condensing the steam in some cases, otherwise an error amounting to ten
per cent, in weight of W may result with a resulting error of 54 per cent,
in the quality. Second, the correct determination of the radiation loss
of the instrument, this in some trials in the Laboratory has amounted to
over 2 per cent, of the steam flowing through. These errors can to a
great extent be determined and reduced, and the probable error of the
instrument can be reduced to one-half per cent, in practice, so that the
accuracy of the instrument may be considered fully double that of the
Standard Barrel Calorimeter.
THE SEPARATOR CALORIMETER.
From a great number of experiments, in which steam was used with
varying degrees of moisture, from 30 per cent, too dry, and in which the
quality of the exhaust steam was subject to determination by a throt-
tling calorimeter, not a single instance was found, in which the steam
passing the separator, was not perfectly dry, within the limits of error of
observation.
This steam being under all circumstances dry the use of a throttling
calorimeter with its thermometer becomes entirely unnecessary, and it
the discharged steam be condensed, both a thermometer and steam gauge
may be dispensed with. There is a certain loss by radiation and con-
densation, which must be determined, and corrected for especially if the
steam is nearly dry. Let this radiation loss for a time equal to the dura-
tion of the run = u in pounds. The weight of separated water = W; the
weight of steam discharged = w.
mi W — U W + U
Then i — x =-™ or x=-rr=
W + w W + w
In case it is inconvenient to condense the discharge steam and weigh
it, if the pressure and area of orifice be determined, it can be computed
quite accurately by Napier's rule already given — Q = }\r PA in pounds
per second.
tin this principle a new Calorimeter has been designed by the writer,
which consists of two chambers, each about eight inches long by two


19
inches in diameter, supplied with a water gauge connection in the lower
portion, having an affixed scale graduated to read into hundredths of a
pound of water. Each of these chambers constitute in effect a separating
device, and the steam from the first chamber passes into the second,
through an orifice, sufficiently large to maintain the same pressure in both
chambers, and from the second, by a still smaller orifice, is discharged
into the open air. The reading in the first chamber gives the total weight,
W, of water in the steam, and in addition the loss by condensation u; in the
second chamber which is exactly like the first in construction, the reading
is the condensation loss u, since it is supplied with perfectly dry steam.
In the practical use of the instrument the discharged steam-is condensed
and weighed, or computed, giving the value of w; the water deposit-
ed is noted from time to time in the two chambers, giving respectively W
and u. These determinations are in general reduced to pounds per hour
in each case. After which the per cent, of moisture is computed by the
formula,
W — u w + u
I — X =tt7 orx=7
W 4- w W + w
While our practical experience has not determined the limits of error
of this instrument, sufficient work has been done with it, against other
instruments, to make it certain that we can determine the quality of steam
accurately to one-quarter of one per cent. There is no limit to the instru-
ment, so far as moisture is concerned, at least up to 40 per cent, water,
but. the amount of superheat that can be determined, depends upon the
value of u, which in a number of cases has not been far from two per cent.
It promises to be a cheap, accurate and portable calorimeter for ordinary
qualities of steam, and since it requires no costly thermometers, it may be
altogether considered the cheapest calorimeter constructed.
THEBMOMETER CUPS.
For the purpose of obtaining the temperature of the steam, small,
thin, brass or iron cups are screwed into the required pipe or fitting, or
in some cases thermometers with attached scales are fitted so that they
may be screwed into the required pipe. I am satisfied that the cups give
equally as good results as the thermometers attached to special fittings,
but that in either case serious errors may result from improper position.
These should be fairly in the flow of the steam or water current, whose
temperature is to be measured. In the use of thermometer cups, I have
found cylinder oil fully as good as mercury and not so dangerous to the
thermometers, but the cups must be kept clean, freefrom waste, damp-
ness or dirt. I have known a bit of waste in a thermometer cup to make
a difference of ten degrees in the reading, and a little moisture to keep
the temperature steadily at boiling point regardless of the true tempera-
ture.

THERMOMETERS.
The use of thermometers with graduations cut on the stem are rec-
ommended for such purposes. These can be had of H. J. Green, 1215
Bedford Ave., Brooklyn, of Huddleston, Boston, or J. W. Queen, Phila-
delphia.
All thermometers should be calibrated for boiling point or freezing
point, and should be tested for air bubbles. Our experience with about
100 thermometers the past year leads us to believe that the makers need
watching in this respect, and that serious errors may result if too much
dependence is placed on their calibrations.
PAIR SAMPLE OF STEAM.
As the practice of calorimetery stands to-day, I regard the methods
of obtaining a fair sample of steam as leading to more error, and as the
cause of more uncertainly than all the other errors combined.
I have found by putting three calorimeters, on the same pipe and
taking steam within a few inches of each other, that according as I
changed the connections to bent or straight, perforated or entire, the final-
ity would vary as much as three per cent or more.
The standard calorimeter connection, as first adopted, has a perfora-
ted nipple extending nearly across.the main steam pipe; this we found to
lead to serious error as it would separate water from the steam, and give
a sample often several per cent too dry, in fact it would carry only about
two per cent of water, no matter what the main pipe contained; just at
present we are using an unperforated nipple extending into the main
pipe one-half inch from the side, but we are not prepared to say that it
supplies us with a perfect sample of steam. This subject must be con-
sidered as open for future investigation, but from the few trials made by
ourselves, it is probable that the sample of steam collected by any of oar
methods is too dry rather than too wet.

ARMATURE REACTIONS,
FRANK C. WAGNER, A. M., B. S.
OLA8S OF '85.
Notwithstanding the fact that open coil armatures were among the first
to be used in the commercial dynamo-electric machine, the electro-mag-
netic reactions occurring in them have always been somewhat of a mys-
tery, and have generally been, deemed incapable of exact analysis. It
is not to be wondered at, in consequence, that the open coil dynamo
stands practically where it did ten years ago, while the closed coil type has
undergone successive modifications until it is now one of the most efficient
machines known for the transformation of energy. It is not expected in
what follows to clear away all difficulties, but it is hoped to present a
method of attacking the problem which will throw light upon what is actu-
ally going on within an open coil armature, and open up the way to an ex-
act quantitative analysis of the effect of armature reactions.
All of what follows is based upon two fundamental laws of electromag-
netism, which are now universally acknowledged to be valid. They are:
(1) That the electromotive force set up in one turn of a conducting wire
is equal to the rate of change of magnetic induction within that turn.
(2) That the magnetic induction in a closed magnetic circuit is equal to
its magnetomotive force divided by its magnetic resistance. The term
magnetic induction corresponds to what is frequently called lines of
force, and magnetomotive force corresponds to magnetizing force.
By the use of the second law above stated it is possible to calculate
the magnetic induction through the armature of a dynamo-electric machine
when the form and dimensions of the machine are given, together with
the magnetic quality of the iron and the magnetizing force of the field
magnets. The formula used for this purpose is:
~ 1

Ao pi Ai j"2 A2
in which H is the value of the
magnetic induction in c. g. s. units; n is the number of turns of wire in
both field magnets; C is the current in amperes flowing in each turn of
wire; lo and Ao are respectively the length and the cross section in cen-
timetres of the air space included in the magnetic circuit; li, Ai and /ii
are the length, cross section and permeability of any homogeneous piece


The Technic.
of iron included in the circuit; h , Aa , and f2 , etc., apply to other pieces
of iron in the circuit.
Knowing the induction through the armature coils, the number of
turns of wire on the armature, and the number of revolutions per minute,
it would seem an easy matter to calculate the induced electromotive force.
And so it would be, were it not for the armature reactions. It is evident
that as soon as a current flows through the armature an induction will be
set up within the armature which will react upon the induction produced
by the field magnets, changing both its value and its direction. The
problem is to find, this resultant induction.
Magnetic induction is a quantity of the nature of a vector, i. e., it
has magnitude, direction and sense. Hence it will be completely repre-
sented by a straight line of definite length with an arrow head to indicate
its sense. Two inductions acting in different directions may be combined
to form a resultant induction, and in general the laws of the composition
and resolution of forces apply to any number of magnetic inductions acting
at the same point. It is to be noted, however, that in the case where the
medium in which the inductions are superimposed is iron, the addition of
inductions may saturate the iron and thus change the magnetic resistance
of the various circuits, and consequently alter the values of their induc-
tions. It would seem then that if we could determine the magnitude and
direction of the induction of each coil of the armature we might combine
these with the induction of the fields and find the direction and magni-
tude of their resultant. This is what I propose to do in what follows.
Let figure 1 represent a section through the pole pieces of a Thomson-
Houston arc dynamo, the armature core being shown in outline. Let the
lines 2, 1,3, represent the position of the three coils of the armature and
the direction of motion be that indicated by the arrow. From actual trial
the lead on the machine under consideration is known to be about 4&lt;&gt; .
Then the dotted line V S' making an angle of 40° with the centre line &lt; f
the field magnets N S, gives the direction of the resultant field approxi-
mately. In the figure, No. 2 coil is taken parallel to the resultant induc-
tion. We will consider the induction as directed from south to north
outside of the magnetizing coil and from north to south within it. The
current flowing in coil No. 2 will create a south pole at s and a
north pole at n. Hence if O A, figure 2, represents the induction due to
field magnets, 0 B drawn parallel to n s will represent the induction due
to coil No. 2. The sense of O B is from n to s, because the field is within
the magnetizing coil. In a similar way O C, perpendicular to No. 1 coil,
and O D, perpendicular to No. 3 coil, represent the inductions due to coils
1 and 3.
The lengths of O A, 0 B, O C and O D are determined as follows: In
the formula for H given above, n is 3990; C is 6.8; lo = 8.88; Ao = 1772;
Ai = !W.24 for the armature core. If the iron of the armature core be not


23
saturated, evidently the term within the parenthesis having the greatest
value will be ^ , which equals .0049. Neglecting the other terms the
value of H becomes 6,960,000, giving an intensity of magnetization
H 6,960,000 . A _ . r_, ., _
—7- = —,., — = 70,800. According to Ewing and Low [Phil. Trans, vol.
Ai 98.24
180 p. 221] the saturation point of best wrought iron is 21,360. Hence it is
readily seen that the armature core must be saturated. The induction
carried by the iron will be 98.24 x 21,360 = 2,098,000 c. g. s. units. The
magnetomotive force is found to be 34,095. Then the magnetic resistance
of the circuit corresponding to the induction in the iron of the armature
core is 34,095 -f- 2,098,000 = .0162. Of this amount .005577 is outside of the
armature core. Hence the equivalent resistance of the armature core
is .0162 — .005577 = .01062.
But the space occupied by the iron can carry in addition an induction
equal to what would be carried if the iron were replaced by air, so that
we have another path for the induction through the spherical air space
inside of the armature winding. To find approximately the magnetic re-
sistance of this air space divide it into five concentric hollow cylinders.
Finding the mean length and cross section of each cylinder compute its
magnetic resistance. The equivalent resistance of these combined cir-
cuits is then found in exactly the same manner as is the equivalent resis-
tance of electrical circuits connected in parallel. In this case it is found
to be .0172. Combining with the equivalent resistance of the armature 1
core we get j \ — .00656. Including the air gap we get as
.0106" + .0172
the entire resistance from pole to pole within the armature winding .00656
-t- .0049 = .01146. In like manner the magnetic resistance of the space
occupied by the armature winding and of the space entirely outside of
the armature are found to be approximately .159 and .0297. The entire
equivalent resistance from pole to pole will then be
1
I i ^ — .00785. The magnetic resistance of the
.01146 + ~7wT + .297
remainder of the circuit is determined by considering the length and cross
section of each iron portion of the circuit together with its permeability
at the actual intensity of magnetization, and substituting in the formula
——- . It is found to be .000978, giving for the total magnetic resistance
A.
.008828. The total magnetic induction is .34095 .008828 = 3,862,000 = Hi.
Of this amount only a part, represented by 'x ^ = 2,645,000, passes
entirely within the armature winding. Another portion equal to


The Technic.
00785
^' x Hi =190,700 passes through the space occupied by the armature
wire; and of this one-half, or 95,350, is enclosed by the mean turn of wire
on the armature. The effective induction through the mean turn of
armature wire is then 2,645,000 + 95,350 = 2,740,350. The remainder of the
induction 1,121,650 constitutes the stray field and is practically lost so far
as the generation of current is concerned. Assuming some convenient
scale make the line O A figure 2 equal to 2,740,350 on that scale.
It is evident that in an armature of only three coils the electromotive
forces induced at different points in the revolution must be quite different.
In consequence the current flowing in the armature coils will vary. Again,
two of the armature coils are always connected in parallel with the third
in series, so that, since the magnetic induction varies with the current, it
is first necessary to determine the current values in each coil. This is
done as follows:
Assuming the induction to be uniformly distributed and parallel to
the resultant induction, we have, if H is the total induction passing
through the mean coil when pependicular to the resultant induc tion, and
is the angle which the coil makes with the resultant induction, H sin
is equal to the induction through the coil in any position. The induced
electromotive force is equal to the rate of change of induction. Hence
the electromotive force generated in a turn of wire making an angle t»
with the resultant induction is ~j~t(H sin = H cos i&gt;-^7- Since the
angular velocity "g^.-is uniform, the electromotive force generated in one
coil is readily calculated by the well known formula E = ^ ^ &gt; where X
is the number of revolutions per second, n is the number of turns of wire
in the armature coil, and H is the total magnetic induction passing
through the coil when perpendicular to the resultant induction. If Ei, is
the maximum value of the electromotive force, then in general E = Ei
it
cos 1? and
E d * = Ej
cos # dtf = E sin &gt;9
1 = E
1
Hence the mean value E'= E -f- ~ Whence E = x 4 ^ ° ^
. it llK*
In this case Ei is taken as 3454 volts.
Now studying the position of the brushes upon the commutator we
find that for full load with coils in the position shown in fig. 1, No. 2 coil
is in series with Nos. 1 and 3 in parallel. Hence for No. 2 coil # = 0, and
E = 3454 volts. ForNos. 1 and 3 1? = 60°, and E = 1727 for each. The
total electromotive force then equals 5181 volts.
Suppose the armature to move forward 10°. The connections will \te
the same as before, No. 2 coil in series with 1 and 3 in parallel. For No 2
coil &lt;&gt;= 10 and E =3401. For No. 1 coil, # =50°, and E = 2220. For


25
No. 3 coil, 1* = 70° and E = 1181. The total electromotive force for this
position will then be 3401 + K (2220 + 1181) =5101 volts. In a similar
manner we find the total electromotive forces for positions at equal enter-
vals apart through a complete cycle of values, in this case through 60°.
Taking the mean of these values we get 4909. The mean current is known
to be 6.8 amperes. Now for any position the current value will be to the
mean current as the total electromotive force in that position is to the
mean total electromotive force. Hence the value of the total current is
known for any given position. This gives the current in the coil which is
connected in series in that position. But the distribution of current in
the coils which are connected in parallel remains to be determined.
Referring to the case in which No. 2. coil makes an angle of 10° with
the resultant induction, it is seen that the electromotive forces generated
in 1 and 3 are 2220 and 1181 respectively. Evidently there will be a ten-
dency for a local current to circulate in coils 1 and 3, due to the difference
of these electromotive forces. Such a current will flow and will be of
such magnitude that the change of induction which it produces in coils 1
and 3 will generate a counter electromotive force in them to balance the
difference of electromotive forces existing. Since coils 1 and 3 are prac-
tically equal, one-half of this counter electromotive force will be induced
in each. The sense of the counter electromotive force induced in No. 1 coil
will be such as to reduce the original electromotive force, and in number
3 coil such as to increase the original electromotive force. So that the re-
sultant electromotive force will be y2 (2220 +1181) as taken above. To
find the value of this local current we proceed as follows:
Let AC be the change occurring in the value of this local current
during a small fraction of a revolution, e. g. 5 degrees. Let Ed be the
mean difference of electromotive forces in coils 1 and 3 during this frac-
tion of a revolution. Let Q be the resistance of the magnetic circuit
through one of the coils in the position under consideration. Let n' be the
number of turns of wire in one armature coil. Let T be the time, in sec-
onds, which it takes for the armature to make the assumed fraction of a
revolution. Applying the formula for H we get for the change in induc-
tion due to the change in current AC, Hd =- - ^ x -q- where Q re-
places the polynominal 4° +—~- + etc. Now by our first general law,
Art ^1 Aj
the induced electromotive force in one turn is equal to the rate of change
of the induction, = = - ^'q^^- Hence in n' turns the induced elec-
tromotive force is —iqq't; = E x 10s;
„ ,. „ , 4 7m'1 AC ExlO'xQT
or E (m volts) = ,. A C= ^
Applying this formula to a movement of No. 1 coil from # = 60° to


The Technic.
# = 55° and of No. 3 coil from &amp; = 60° to # = 65°, we have the following.
Electromotive force of No. 1 coil when i?" = 55°, equals 1982 volts. Elec-
motive force of No. 3 coil when = 65°, equals 1460. Difference equals
522 volts. When for both coils * = 60°, the difference is zero. Hence the
mean difference is 261. Of this one-half or 130.5 volts must be induced in
each coil by the reaction of the local current. From known data of the
dynamo we have Q = .01; T = .00098; n' = 1333.
130.5 x 10° x .01 x .00098
•'• AC = 4^x1333x1333 = -0o8 amPere"
In a similar manner the changes in the local reaction current can be
found for successive portions of a revolution included within a cycle of
changes. It will be noticed that no account has been taken of the drop
in electromotive force due to the dead resistance in the reaction circuit.
In this case the combined resistance of the two coils is 24 ohms hot, giving
a back electromotive force due to dead resistance of 24 x .058 = 1.4 volts,
which may be neglected in comparison with 261 volts.
The next point is to determine in what position the total current di-
vides equally between the two coils connected in parallel. The only
assumption which gives cyclic changes is that the current divides equally
just before and just after commutation, i. e. when for two of the coils
= 30° and for the third tS* = 90°. In this position we find for the value
of the total current 6.21 amperes. Suppose No. 1 coil to have been com-
mutated immediately preceeding; then No. 2 coil will be in series with 1
and 3 in parallel. The current in No. 2 coil will be 6.21 amperes, and in
Nos. 1 and 3, 3.105 amperes each. Let the armature turn through 10°.
In this new position the total current is found to be 6.74 amperes.
AC = 1.107 amperes. Hence the current flowing in No. 3 coil will be
-~+ 1.107 = 4.477; and in No. 1 coil will be ^-—1.107 = 2.263. In
this manner the current flowing in each coil at any position of the arma-
ture can be determined.
The resistance of the magnetic circuit of each armature coil can be
determined in the same manner as in the case of the main magnetic cir-
cuit, being careful to observe which portions of the armature core are
saturated. Knowing the current, the number of turns and the magnetic
resistance, we have all the data necessary to determine the induction.
For example, in the position shown in figs. 1 and 2 the total current is
found to be 7.17 amperes, and flows in No. 2 coil. The magnetic resistance
for No. 2 coil is determined to be .00876. Hence the induction =
— * 1333 I7-1- = 1,371,000. In fig. 2 make OB = 1,371,000 on the scale
10 x .00876' s
chosen. In a similar manner make OC = 464,000 and OD = 6(&gt;&gt;,000.
Combining these vectors we get O E for the resultant induction, both in
direction and magnitude.
In like manner finding the resultant inductions for a number of posi-


27
tions within a cycle, i. e. from one point of commutation to the next, and
drawing the vectors all on one diagram, we get fig. 3. 01, 02, 03, etc.
represent both in direction and magnitude the resultant inductions for
positions 10° apart. 07 is the induction immediately before commutation
and 01 immediately after. The armature is short circuited for an interval
corresponding to 3° at full load. What takes place during commutation
it is not possible to state.
Calculating what would be the total induced electromotive forces if the
inductions are as shown in fig. 3, we get the following, where the numbers
correspond with the resultant inductions in fig. 3.
(1) 4486
(2) 4233
(3) 4067
(4) 3382
(5) 3041
(6) 2777
(7) 2513
Taking the mean we get 3500 volts. This type and size of dynamo in
actual work carries from 55 to 58 arc lights. Allowing 52 volts to a lamp
this corresponds to an external electromotive force of from 2800 to 3016
volts. The drop of potential in the dynamo due to dead resistance is
about 500 volts, giving a total of from 3360 to 3516 volts. There is also a
counter electromotive force of self induction in the field magnets of inde-
terminate amount varying with the quality of iron employed. The agree-
ment of the calculated with the actual electromotive force is fully as good
as could be expected.

CLASS OF '90.
Not far from the city of Cairo in Egypt, stands the largest of the
famous Egyptian pyramids,—one of the grandest monuments that the
architects of the past ages have left us in proof of the magnitude, solidity,
and even harmonious splendor of their times. Its base, which is
square, covers over 11 acres, of the sands, of the Nile, and its height little
less than our Washingtou Monument, nearly 500 feet. The stones used
in its construction would perhaps each serve as a monument at the present
day, the smallest being 30 feet in length. Would not this, then, or if you
will a more architectural structure, as the Temple of Babylon, 6&lt;&gt;0 feet in
height and whose bricks were 20 feet long, 15 feet broad and 7 feet thick,
form a fitting starting point for a long journey of friendship that has ex-
isted between the naturally allied arts of Architecture and Engineering—
a mutual bond, both dealing with the structures of mankind, which has at
last given us the present examples of strength and beauty that Architec-
tural Engineering has made possible. Architectural, in reference to the
form, expression, utility and beauty of the edifice;—Engineering, perhaps
hiden from the eye to a great extent if not wholly in the construction,
durability and magnitude of the possibilities which open up before the
mind accustomed to deal with the forces and matter of nature, and adapt
them to the ever increasing needs of an axacting public.
For are not the temples, tombs, palaces and habitations of man the
surest indications of the needs, customs and arts of the people who build
them? Must not our resources keep pace with our wants, and provide
for the constant progress and improvement that our complex lives require?
Cain, the son of Adam "builded a city , and called the name of the city
after the name of his son, Enoch," the rude mud hut or the flimsy struc-
ture of reeds serving as a habitation; but by the gradual advancement of
civilization, the materials of nature assume higher planes in the fulfill-
ment of man's uses,—till we gradually evolve the magnificent struc-
tures of modern architectural engineering.
The ethnologist tells us of an age of clay; then stone in the rough ami
later polished—an age of iron, then bronze, and of late we add the
epoch of steel. Is it not so in our building construction? First the clay
and the reeds which even yet exist in China and eastern countries, and


29
as we have so lately learned, so primitive even in our 19th century in
dark Africa. Then the brick of clay and straw, the burned brick, and the
age of stone reaching such a height of excellence as is shown us later by
the works of the Grecians, Romans, and the palaces of the middle ages.
Think of the Temple of Solomon at Jerusalem—46 years in erection the
historians tell us, and whose stones were 46 feet long, 21 feet high and 14
feet thick, some even of the great length of 82 feet. Would it not tax the
ingenuity of an engineer to handle such masses of stone even in our own
advanced age? But with the hurrying strides of civilization, comes the
demand for a cheaper and quicker construction, a medium to be more
easily handled than the huge blocks of stone of early ages,—a substance
combining the strength, durability and adaptability required by our de-
mands of commerce and rapid progress,—a speedy return for our capital
invested.
Such a material is found in steel,—The symbol of our present age of
construction and which has made possible the huge frame works of metal
and terra cotta that adorn our large cities today. And it is a few facts in
connection with the engineering or constructional part of such a struc-
ture that I will try and present as being of value to the engineering,
student, though in only too many cases the architect who has designed
the sugar coated covering as it were, to make it palatable to the public,
reaps all the reward and praise for what the engineer has made possible.
And as tha "sky scraper" office buildings of our American Cities present
interesting features, let us look at some of the problems involved in such
construction.
Let us take as the subject of our consideration, the twenty storied
structure known as the Masonic Temple, now building in the heart of the
business portion of Chicago, the home we may safely say of the now too
common sixteen, seventeen, twenty, and who can guess how many storied
buildings. Our building occupies a prominent northeast corner at the
intersection of two business thoroughfares, a lot of 170 feet front and 113
feet deep, with the great advantage of alleys on the north and east sides.
On this lot is to be erected a modern office building, fitted with all the
thousand and one improvements and luxuries that go to make up that
marvel of American invention, a perfect hive of industry unsurpassed in
the world.
. And first, it must be fire-proof in the latest sense of the word. But a
very few years ago a so called fire-proof building meant one constructed of
beams and cast iron columns, with brick arches sprung from beam to
beam resting on the lower flanges. This construction left the entire col-
umn and a great part of the beams exposed to view, and what is much
more serious to the possibility of contact with fire. This was the great
trouble, for at a comparatively low temperature the iron fails in its carry-
ing capacity, while a sudden cooling by water causes it to break, as was
so well exemplified in a large fire in Boston a year ago.


The Technic.
The method of fireproofing now employed, consists, we might say, of
a skeleton or frame-work of wrought iron or mild steel, inclosed in a
sheating of porous terra cotta, a material but little known and used
ten years ago. Every square inch of the metal work is protected by
means of the various shapes made by the terra cotta companies, and all
direct communication between the metal and heat is avoided. This por-
ous tile is made of clay, which before it is burnt is mixed in considerable
proportions with sawdust and finely cut straw. During the firing these
ingredients are consumed, leaving the material in a very porous condition.
Of course a great advantage is gained in the saving of weight over the old
brick arch method. It amounts to a saving of over fifty per cent., thus
warranting more economical proportions in the iron framing. Fig. 1
shows sections of interior colnmns, surrounded by these special shapes.
For floor arches the ordinary flat tile arch is generally used, shown in
fig. 2. The voussoir blocks are cemented together, having radiallv inclin-
FiS.2
ed joints, as in any segmental arch. The skewbacks of the arch take the
shape of the iron beams against which they bear, different skewbuckc
being ready at hand for each different depth of beam that may be found
in the floor. An arch may have a 12-inch beam in one side and a 7-inch
beam in the other. The lower surfaces of the tile reach about an inch be-
low the bottom of the beam, and a thin piece of tile is slipped in under
the lower flange of the beam, as shown in the figure, to complete the pro-
tection against fire. A coat of cement is given the whole surface, when it
is ready for such decorative treatment as maybe desired. The beams are


31
thus entirely surrounded by the best known nou heat-conducting building
materials, brick, cement and concrete. Special shapes for skewbacks,
etc., are shown in Fig. 3. For large spans an arch is often used following
the curve of pressure, adding materially to the strength of• a flat arch.
Such arches have been tested without failure to loads of one ton per
square foot.*
Six or seven feet is the maximum span allowed in the ordinary flat
arch construction, and it is here that we get the conditions governing the
location of our floor beams and columns. Around the outside of the build-
ing, the locations of the columns are, of course, governed by the architec-
tural arrangement of the piers, but they must always be placed near
enough to allow the use of an I beam as a girder from column to column,
or in special cases two I beams placed side by side, acting as one girder,
or in larger spans still a plate, or lattice girder. The "framing plans"
are thus worked up, showing the locations of all the columns, girders and
joists in a floor plan. The girders run from column to column, and sup-
port the joists so placed as to divide the floor space into spans of 5, 6 or 7
feet as stated. These floor beams are generally figured by means of the
table of coefficients, found in Carnegie's handbook;—obtained by multi-

* Some very interesting tests of fireproof arches were recently published in the
American Architect and Building News. These tests were made in Denver, Col.,
for the Denver Equitable Building Co., under the supervision of a board of Archi-
tects. Some astonishing results were obtained through the use of a porous tile arch,
in which the hollow spaces of the arch run crosswise from beam to beam, instead of
parallel to the beam, as shown in the above figures. The arches were sprung from
beams placed 5 feet centers and among the results were the following: A load of 15145
pounds of pig iron was carried successfully for two hours; afterwards broken by a
ram. Arch was given eleven applications of water, and was uninjured after twenty-
three hours, and a continuous Are under il for twenty-four hours had practically no
effect, as it sustained a load of 12500 pounds on a space 3 feet wide at center of arch.

A difference is made in the live load as shown in the table for the
reason that a great part of such a moving load is taken up in the vibration
of the floor-beams, and as it is transferred from joist to girder, from girder
to column, and thence down the columns to the foundations, it is gradu-
ally lost.
Care must be taken in figuring beams to see that the length is not too
great, giving a deflection sufficient to crack the plaster ceiling beneath.
About ti'o of an inch per foot of clear span is the usual maximum permis-
sible deflection. Under ordinary loads this is attained when the clear
span is about 26 times the depth of the beam.
Steel columns are fast superseding the old types of cast columns for
many reasons,—principally on account of the uncertain factors which
enter into the strength of a casting. As far as the metal itself is concern-
ed we can easily obtain such results as our specifications demand; but in
the manufacture or casting we run the risk of cold shuts, where the metal
unites imperfectly after becoming cooled by running through the moulds,
unequal thicknesses in hollow columns, and spongy or honey-corned places
causeil by the gasses. Cast columns must always be examined by the
inspectors for such defects, but how sure can we be that such hidden dan-
gers are discovered? I remember a prominent architect telling of the
experience of one of his inspectors. He was examining a cast column by
tapping or sounding it with a light hammer. Discovering what be thought
a suspicious ring he called the foreman of the yard for his opinion. Of

course the latter urged its immediate shipment, declaring it was nothing.
Not satisfied, the inspector discovered a very slight mark like a scratch in
the outside of the column, and getting a chisel and hammer, what was his
surprise to have a piece of very considerahle size fly out at the first blow.
He had fortunately found a cold shut. This great uncertainty led to the
use ot a high factor of safety in cast columns, say 8; whereas in box
columns of steel plates we use some such factor as 4, or say 12500 lbs. per
square inch in short columns, where calculation by the radius of gyration
can be omitted. The column weights are thus reduced. A great point in
such large buildings as our example.
The subject of the columns aud piers of our building is capable of
three treatments, each of which is used in its own particular circum-
stances.
First.—Where the outside piers are entirely of masonry,.carrying all
weights which come on them by masonry alone. Such construction is
used in buildings of moderate height where the material used in the
fronts is such that it must be laid solidly in good-sized piers—such as
granite, stone, or the massive flat brick effect. But in the larger buildings,
of which we are particularly speaking, it is the exception rather than the
rule in the new construction to rely entirely on masonry piers, except
perhaps where we have a very tall building on a narrow lot, so that the
piers and a party wall may serve as a stiffener to the iron frame-work in-
side. The objections to such masonry piers in a case like ours are twofold;
firstly, the modern revpiirments of plenty of light for all our offices de-
mands that the windows be broad and numerous, and the piers narrow.
In the enormously high buildings of the present, hardly any masonry con-
struction is strong enough to carry its own weight and the floor loads for so
great a height with so small a cross section. In the Masonic Temple it was
found that the maximum allowable pressure of 12 tons per sq. ft. on brick
work would have been reached at the 5th floor; or, below that level the load
exceeded the crushing resistance of the material. Secondly—that large
masonry piers take up too much valuable renting space. AVhen the rent
of offices is proportioned at so much per sq. foot, this becomes a matter of
much importance to the owner.
Second method—is where metal columns are placed inside the exter-
ior piers to carry the floor and roof loads and all weights except those of
the masonry facings which are carried by the piers surrounding the col-
umns. In this case, great care must be taken that the masonry does not
touch the columns, in order that the unequal settlement of the metal-
work and masonry may not cause undesirable strains. On account of the
numerous mortar joints the masonry will settle much faster than metal;
if then it bears on rivet heads, plates or connections in the columns, we
have a heav}' strain that has not been provided for. Great care is neces-
sary here to provide sufficient "open joints" at points over cornices, etc.

where they will least be noticed, to provide for such settlement. Also
where the mass is not homogeneous as in stone facing and brick backiDg,
the result is likely to be that the stone, with fewer joints settles less and
receives more than its share of the load, producing cracks and spallingoff
the angles. This was true of the Washington Monument.
The third method is the one becoming more common at present and
is the one which perhaps opens the means for building our highest struc-
tures. That is, to throw all of the weight on the metal 'columns, sur-
rounding them with an ornamental shell of therra cotta or other light ma-
terial which is securely anchored to and supported by the columns at the
various floors. So that in reality our building becomes nothing more nor
less than a vital skeleton of steel, with a pretty wrapper on the outside
and a film of plaster and decorative work on the inside. The terra cotta
companies design their pieces with special reference to tying them on or
suspending them from such a frame work. You can see arches innumer-
able, which to the casual observer seem to support some heavy wall above
to be nothing but a series of hollow tile held by wires or clamps to a beam
or girder which really carries all the load, and the massive wall proves tu
be nothing but a two-inch coating of clay.
What are called "spandrel" beams run from column to column, or
pier to pier, over a window space, and hold the arch for the window be-
neath, and the sill or coping above. Some spandrel sections are shown
in Figs. 5 and (i. l' ig. l&gt; shows a section takep through a projecting hay-

window, which is supported at the various floors by bracketing out from
the floor-beams. The beam "A" is a main girder running from column to
column, "B" is a floor joist.

The conditions often require that a girder strike the column off center,
necessitating a bracket on one side of the column to support it. In such
cases and in all exterior columns, when the loads are not applied equally
on all sides of the columns, we should use a less unit strain, due to eccen-
tric loading. Many, or in fact most engineers, disregard this entirely, but
in such large buildings it is best to investigate the difference. Rankine's
formula can be used, and was found to reduce the unit strain considerably
in the Masonic Temple.
Z columns have been used to some extent recently, but do not seem
to meet with much favor. They can be used advantageously for small
sections, but when side plates must be added the connections become bad
and if figured by the radius of gyration it would appear that a large part
of the section at the center of the column is lost. They have also the dis-
advantage of being rolled by but a few of the larger mills. In this age of
push and hurry, the quick delivery of material is an essential point. The
demand for structural steel in our country to-day is so great that it is al-
most impossible to secure such a prompt delivery as is required for the
completion of such a building in the specified time. The contracts that
are being made in Chicago to-day for some of these large buildings un-

doubtedly insure the most wonderful construction in point of excellence
and short time that the world has ever seen. The Masonic foundations
were completed in as many weeks as months were formally required—and
the contractors are under heavy bonds and forfeits to complete their work
by specified time. Those who predict the inability of the World's Colum-
bian Exposition management to prepare the buildings in time, would do
well to learn what is being done in the way of quick and good building
too, in Chicago to-day. It is said of a large building in New York City
that the masonry for the twelfth story was laid before the mortar of the
first floor level was dry.
In connection with the design of the columns and floor-beams, we
must not forget to provide vertical bracing for our building. Who would
think of building a bridge without providing for the wind pressure in l&gt;oth
vertical and lateral wind bracing; and yet how many high buildings have
been designed with no such provision. The horizontal bracing we may
safely omit, as the many floor-beams form a very stiff system in this di-
rection, but the vertical bracing is only just commencing to be recognized
as of quite as much importance as in a bridge. One great objection to this
vertical bracing is its interferance with the plans of the rooms, offices and
windows, running diagonally from floor to floor and column to column,
just where we may want to place our halls or doors, or perhaps leave
entirely open as in a banking floor. But as more and more of the con-
structional work of our large buildings is being put in the hands of engi-
neers, as opposed to the pure architects—just so will they insist that the
primary consideration in a building is its construction, and hence the
artistic portion of the design must adapt itself to the more essential features.
In many of the offices of the more prominent architects we find two dis-
tinct corps of workmen; the architectural draughtsman, pure and simple
for all decorative and designing work, and the engineers who care for the
more substantial problems. In such an office the two kinds of work can
be carried forward simultaneously, concessions made on both sides, and a
satisfactory medium reached.
Many interesting details have to be studied and definitely settled l&gt;e-
fore the foundation plans can be decided. Our partitions are made from
the same character of hollow tile as is used in the flreproofing of the
columns and in the floor arches. They can be readily torn down and
shifted to suit the tenant, without injuring the construction in a particle,
as they are seldom used to support any weight. Our interior court must
lie a prominent feature in the design; to give plenty of air and light to the
inside offices, its walls being faced with marble or glazed brick. Sumcient
elevators must be provided in order to insure rapid service, and l&gt;eams
figured to support the sheaves which carry them. In the Masonic Temple
fourteen passenger elevators are provided and two more are used for
freight exclusively. These necessitate an ejector pit in the basement and
a s-ullicicut water supply if the elevators are hydraulic.


37
In our particular example a few details out of the ordinary run in
office buildings are found. The seventeenth and eighteenth floors are
devoted to Masonic purposes. On the seventeenth we have two large
drill rooms, down either side of the court. This requires that an interior
row of columns be omitted in the center of each drill hall. This is pro-
vided for by supporting the floors by lattice girders, which run between
the columns at either side of each hall. From these girders spring the
gable roof trusses, with an arched system spanning the lodge and banquet
rooms on the eighteenth floor. On the twentieth floor we have the large
water tanks to supply the building and elevators. The top of the twenti-
eth floor, called the "deck roof" has a four-foot parapet all around the
edge, the whole covered by a large curved glass roof, serving as a summer
garden and place of observation.
The gable roof running up to the
parapet is constructed of book-tile
laid on T iron, as shown in Fig. 7,
on which fancy tile, iron or slate
may be fastened.
All these details must be well determined, including the weights of
all structural material, wind, snow, elevator and tank loads, floor loads,
etc., before we can commence the "column sheets." These sheets form
a tabulated list of all the loads that come on each column, beginning at
the roof and adding in the loads that come at the successive floors as
wye descend. From these sheets we can see the exact load that each
column must carry at each floor, and the sectional area required; and
finally the total load transferred to each footing.
Now comes the delicate problem; especially in Chicago and vicinity,
where the underlying strata consist of layers of clay or hard pan from
three to seven feet thick, lying perhaps 10 or 12 feet below the street
levels. By means of compression tests and government experiments, as
well as individual tests, it is found that this layer of clay will safely carry-
not more than three, and at a conservative estimate say two tons per square
foot allowing for a reasonable settlement.
This settlement is the great evil that must be provided against, and
the case of the Government building well exemplifies its evils. This
building was built 14 years ago, and the government superintendent of
buildings recently stated that it had settled 18 inches in places, and the
movement was still progressing. Numerous cracks and bursting of water
and steam pipes, and of late the falling of a skylight, are some of the evi-
dences of this movement.
The investigation of the soil's compressibility leads to the conclusion
that if we wish to procure uniform settlement, all parts of the foundation
areas must be exactly proportioned to the loads they have to carry. The
footings themselves must be of sufficient strength to distribute the applied
loads over the requisite area. In this way only can we obtain satisfactory
results.


The Technic.
The problem has been most successfully solved within the past few-
years, as is well illustrated by an example of the past few mouths. Ex-
tensive foundations on the old plan had been completed some years since
for a large mercantile building. When the foundations were completed,
work was stopped. A short time ago the land was sold as it was and
plans were immediately made for a new building. The first thing done
was to rip out all the old piers at a cost of many thousand dollars. This
old system consisted of stone piers made of successive layers of large
stones stepping out till a sufficient base was obtained. The objections to
these were many. They are expensive, as heavy dimension stones are
necessary; they are of great weight, which we wish to avoid, and very
bulky, taking up much valuable space in the basement, which is quite as
desirable as office space for restaurants, etc., and especially for the large
boiler and electric light plants necessary in such large buildings. It is
even customary now to use all available space under sidewalks and alleys
for such plants.
The new type of foundations here described are now used very exten-
sively where no very stable bottom is reached. It consists first of a layer
of concrete, about 2 feet thick, upon winch comes layers of I beams or steel
rails each layer laid transverse to those just below or above it. The
spaces between and around these rails are rammed tight with concrete,
• preserving the iron from the action of air and water.
The layers decrease in area
as they ascend, and the rails are
spaced or calculated in regard to
size acceording to the bending
moments arising from the load
and length of rail. The whole
forms a solid grill-work of steel,
protected and stiffened by the
concrete. On the top layer the
casting to receive the column is
placed as shown in Fg. 8. With
the old pier construction a pile of
stones would be necessary some
10 to 15 feet high;—while here
we obtain a far better result with
a height of 3 or 4 feet. These
footings are often made 15 to 20
feet square, and in some cases
completely cover the lot.
We must not forget that our
footings have been designed for
the,final loads that rest on them,

and at all points of the construction we must strive to keep the same rela-
tion between the weights on the piers as we will have in the com-
pleted building, if we wish a uniform settlement. This was well ex-
emplified in the case of the Auditorium Tower, which extends many
stories above the main building. Here, the tower foundations were loaded
with various weights of pig iron at the different stages of construction, in
order that the proper excess on these piers, as in the final weight, should
be preserved. Even this great tower built with all possible precaution
and after careful tests of the ground beforehand, has settled more than
originally allowed for. It is needless to say that these foundations require
the nicest engineering skill. When piles can be used to advantage the
labor is simplified.
One of the most delicate problems is in constructing a very heavy
building by the side of one already completed, so that the latter will not
suffer by settlement due to the additional weight of the new building.
Such settlement is shown in a remarkable degree in the case of a very
badly cracked and disfigured front of a building next the Auditorium be-
fore mentioned. The front is at present being rebuilt.
In such a problem, the old wall is carried on timbers supported at
either end by jack-screws. The new wall is now put in, and with its
foundations settles gradually, while the jack-screws are turned as occasion
demands to keep the old wall at its proper level. This may be continued
till all settlement ceases, when we may remove the jack-screws one by
one and substitute a new wall under the old building.
If we cannot have access to the basement of the old building, or under-
pinning in the previous manner is impossible, cantilever foundations may
be employed as in the well known Rand McNally building. The old foun-
dations must not carry any additional weight, and yet we cannot substi-
tute new ones as before described. The accompanying figure will
sufficiently explain itself. The usual type of footings is employed, I

next the old, and still produces the most settlement away from the lot
line.
This, perhaps, will give a glimpse of what architectural engineering
means to us at the present time, though there are many novel and excellent
applications of engineering in this field that I have not mentioned. The
conditions of every case suggest the treatment, and different localities
have their own distinct peculiarities. But when we recollect how very
recent all these strides have been changing our buildings from six to six-
teen stories and over in the course of a couple of years—how can we
attempt to say what the engineering possibilities still in store for us may
be.
I might mention perhaps the most daring design yet put before a
public already accustomed to monstrosities. A prominent Xew York
architect and engineer has designed a building of 32 stories, and -142 feet
high. The study of this building is given in the Xew York Sun of Feb.
8th, 1891; it shows a structure whose foundations cover the entire surface
of a lot 75 feet square, constructed of steel columns and girders, with
facing walls only of granite, brick and terra cotta. The weight is uniform-
ly distributed on bed rock if possible to reach; or if not, on piling or iron
grillage.
Let us hope that our houses may be builded on a rock, and that the
storms as well as the quiet tide of advancement of many generations yet
to come, may see our monuments of engineering skill and grandure still
the wonder and admiration of a busy world.


ft NEW METHOD OF MEASURING INSULATION RESISTANCE,
GEORGE W. PATTERSON, A. B., S. B.
The usual methods of measuring insulation resistance having failed to
give satisfactory results when used in testing a sample of insulated wire,
it became necessary to seek for another. The method which was finally
used has certain resemblences to two others, namely, the direct deflection
and the fall of potential methods, which are well known; but as it avoids
the principal fault of-each of these methods, at least when applied in this
case, it seems original enough to be worth describing.
The fault of the direct deflection method is that, if the wire has an
insulation resistence of, say, over a hundred thousand megohms, it is very
diflir.ilt, U3in* an eleetrj motive force of les3 than several hundred volts,
to obtain a galvanometer which is at the same time both sensitive enough
to give a large deflection and stable enough to give a constant zero reading.
The fault of the second method is that an insulated wire of even short
length, if connected with a source of electricity, will usually go on in-
creasing its charge for several minutes at a considerable rate, and
sometimes for even an hour at a measurable rate. This increment does
not increase the apparent charge ; for part of the charge has become, for
the time being, latent. It is said to be absorbed. This absorbing goes on
even after the source of electricity is removed. A charge, once absorbed,
is not readily given up ; consequently a wire will appear to have leaked
all that has been absorbed between the time its charging ceases and the
time it is discharged.
The sample of insulated wire, the subject of the experiment, was one
thousand (1,000) feet in length, and No. 18 B. &amp; S. gauge. In the course
of the experiment it was found to have an insulation resistance of about
ninety thousand (90,000) megohms and a capacity of about eighty-two
thousandths (0.082) of a microfarad. In order to insure its being well wet,
it had been kept for several months in the tank of water in which it lay
during the experiment.
The two methods which were first used and which proved unsatis-
factory were as follows: In the former, the direct deflection method, the
insulated wire and the lining of the tank were connected with the termi-
nals of a storage battery of 02.5 volts E. M. F., through a Thomson astatic
galvanometer of 6,656 ohms resistance,and keys which allowed'the cutting
out or the reversal of the galvanometer, as well as the making or the


The Technic.
breaking of the main circuit. The galvanometer, which was read
by means of a telescope and scale, was about as sensitive as one could
make it and still feel confident that the zero would remain unchanged.
For convenience the telescope and scale were put at such a distance that
each millimeter of the scale corresponded to a thousandth (0.001) of a
microampere, i. e. a thousand-millionth (0.000 000,001) of an ampere.
While the wire was charging, the galvanometer was cut out; after a
few seconds it was again thrown into circuit, and when the needle came
to rest the steady deflection was read. Reversing the galvanometer pave
a deflection in the opposite direction. The mean deflection was taken.
As the needle was somewhat unsteady, it was difficult to read the deflec-
tion to within one-tenth. As nearly as the reading could be made, it was
about 0.7 mm. This would indicate a current of about 0.000,7 of a
microampere, there being as before a possible error of one part in seven.
The insulation resistance (in megohms) is obtained by dividing the E.
M. F. (in volts) by the current (in microamperes). In this ease it was,
within one part in seven, ninety thousand (00,000 ±13,003) megohms.
The uncertainty of the result heir g so great, the second method was
then tried. This was the well known loss of charge method. It may be
briefly described as follows: First, its capacity having been measured
the insulated wire is charged for some definite period and'immediately
discharged through a ballistic galvanometer. It is then recharged as be-
fore, bat instead of being immediately discharged it is insulated fur some
suitable period, in order that part of the charge may be lost; after the
period has elapsed it is discharged through the galvanometer. The rati"
of the two readings is the same as the ratio of the E. M. F.'s at the
beginning and at the end of the period of insulation. Dividing the length
of the period (in seconds) by the product of the capacity (in microfarads
and the Napierian logarithm of the ratio of the potentials gives the
insulation resistance (in megohms)
Several different lengths of the periods of charging and of insulation
were taken. Calculating the insulation resistance by equation [1], various
results were obtained. They were, on the average, not greatly different
from the result previously obtained ;but as they differed among themselves
by fullv fifteen thousand megohms, it was evident that this method was, in
this case, no more satisfactory than the previous one. The variations in
the result are doubtless due to absorption.
Neither determination being considered sufficiently accurate, it oc-
curred to me that the lirst method might be so varied as to avoid the small
readings and still use no greater K. M. F. The variation consisted ia

charging the wire, and having insulated it, to allow the leakage to go on
unreplaced for a suitable period of time and then to measure the quantity
of electricity which was needed to charge the wire as before; for although
the deflection of the galvanometer was too small to be accurately read if
the leakage from the wire was continuously replaced, yet when the leak-
age for a period of even a few seconds was replaced in an instant, the
throw of the needle became considerable. In order to simplify the
calculation, a ballastic galvanometer was set at such a distance from the
telescope and scale that each mm. of deflection corresponded to one
thousandth (0.001) of a microcoulomb. The colistant of the ballistic gal-
vanometer is obtained by dividing the quantity of electricity producing the
throw of the needle by the number of scale divisions of the deflection.
The quantity of electricity is measured by the product of the capacity of
the condenser and the E. M. F. of the cell used. To calibrate the galvan-
ometer we used a Carhart-Clark standard cell of 1.440 volts E. M. F. and
an Elliott condenser of 0.1 of a microfarad capacity. The condenser was
charged by the cell and then discharged through the galvanometer. The
deflection was 144 mm. The constant was consequently 0.001=K. In gen-
eral. Ygc ' Ci

where Vs-c-= the E. M. F. of the standard cell, Ci=the capacity of the
condenser and Di = the deflection of the galvanometer. The quantity
Q2 which would cause a deflection D2 must equal K ' D2, therefore by [2]
1)2
Qi = . Vso . Ci [3]
Di
Having found the constant of the galvanometer we may proceed to
measuie the leakage from the insulated wire. The wire is connected
with the storage battery as first described, and to insure its becoming
fully charged it is left on closed circut for, say, half an hour. Next the
galvanometer is introdcced into the circuit, and at some carefully noted
time the circuit is broken. After a certain period, say thirty seconds, the
key is closed for an instant and the throw of the needle is noted. After
another like period a second reading is taken and so on for a considerable
time. It may be remarked here that the fall of potential is so slight in
short periods that the deflections are, within the limits of errors of ob-
servation, proportional to the lengths of the periods; consequently, even
if there should be large variations in the lengths of the separate periods,
the summation of the readings for, say, five minutes will remain practic-
ally a constant. This constant for five minutes was found to be within
two of two hundred and ten (210±2), which would make the value for a
period of thirty seconds within two tenths of twenty-one (21 ±0.2).
It was noticed that if the readings were begun before the charge had
become practically a maximum, that the readings were somewhat larger

but gradually fell, and in the course of half an hour had almost reached
their minimum.
The usual formula for loss of charge is

This method has been in use during the past five months, in the labora-
tory and has been found to be very satisfactory. In one case it was tried on
anew piece of insulated wire which had, at first, an insulation resistance
of over 500,000 megohms. The other methods were a total failure when
applied, but the new method gave regular results. The wire showed the
effect of absorption very clearly, for the deflections kept on decreasing for
several hours until at the eud of the fourth hour they had fallen to one
third of the valve which they had twenty minutes after the charging be-
gan. The first method gave no readable deflection at all and the second
method gave nothing satisfactory owing to the absorption.
In presenting the new method I would call attention to what I con-
sider its chief advantages over the more common methods. In the first
place, supposing that the wire has sufficient capacity to admit of the use
of any of these methods, we may apply in any case in which the first (the
direct deflection method) would fail. Increase in the insulation resistance
is not a hindrance, as in the first method; but it may be considered as a
help, for it allows a greater length of time between observations. Ab-

sorption also need cause no error if charging is allowed to go on until
saturation is reached. In the second place it is far more accurate than
either of the other methods; and when to these is added the extreme sim-
plicity of the calculations which are made without recourse to Napierian
logarithms, it would seem as though the worth of the method were es-
tablished.


METALLIC PARABOLIC ARCH, RINGED AT CROl ONLY,
CHARLES E. GHEEXE, A. M., C. E.
Arches have been classified usually under three heads :—those which
have hinges, or joints where there is no resistance to flexure, one at the
crown and one at each springing; those which are hinged at the two
springings only; and those which have no hinges. The large braced-arch
bridge at Minneapolis and the stiffened suspension bridge at the Point,
Pittsburgh, belong to the first class; in the second class is the Washing-
ton bridge at New York; all stone arches, as well as numerous metallic
ones, are found in the third class.
It is evident that one class is missing from this enumeration, and that
we might have arches with a single hinge. The writer is not aware that
such a structure exists or that an analysis of this kind of arch has been
published. It is proposed in the present article to give the data by which
a parabolic arch with a hinge at the crown may be designed. These data
were obtained by the method of analysis followed in the writer's "Arches;"
the notation will agree with that there used, and reference may be made
to that book for further explanation of the treatment. To faciliate the
comparison of the type discussed in this paper with arches having two
hinges or no hinges, the values of the thrusts, maximum bending moments
and shears in the last two will be reproduced here. The arch with a
single hinge appears to possess some meritorious features.
Since there is one hinge, the location of the equilibrium polygon when
a single weight is placed on any given point on the arch will be
determined by two equations of condition; and since the tangents to the
rib at the two springings are fixed in direction, the condition applicable to
this case are—First, that, under the bonding moments then set up, the
horizontal movement of the hinge at the crown with reference to one tan-
gent shall be equal and opposite to its horizontal movement when referred
to the other tangent; and Second, that the vertical displacement of the
crown shall be the same when referred to either tangent. The vertical
ordinate from any point of the arch to the horizontal line through the
crown will be the arm for the first condition, and the horizontal abscissa
from the same point to a vertical through the crown will be the arm for
the second condition.
If, then, a weight W is placed at a horizontal distance n c from the


The Tfxijnic.
crown of this arch, whose span is 2c and rise k, the ordinate from the
springing line to the equilibrium polygon at the weight will ho

AMERICAN HARBOR ENGINEERING.
GEORGE Y. WISNER, C. E.
CLASS OF '65.
Harbor improvement in the United States is to a great extent a
monopoly in the hands of the Army Engineer Corps, but differ from monop-
olies in general in that its object is to absorb whatever credit there may
be in any enterprise undertaken and to shift responsibility in case of
failure.
Up to the present time the amount of money appropriated and ex-
pended for river and harbor improvements amounts to about $8,200,000—
for surveys and examinations, and $201,400,000 for construction and im-
provements. This amount if judiciously expended in carrying out well
devised plans, ought to have produced enough deep-water ports for the
commerce of the country and done much toward putting our interior
waterways in a good navigable condition.
A comparison with the works of foreign countries makes an exceedingly
unfavorable showing while at the same time the engineering enterprises
of this country conducted by civil engineers are both in design and execu-
tion unsurpassed in the world.
The reason for this failure in one case and success in the other is that
the successful engineer is generally a specialist in his particular branch of
engineering while the government engineer seldom remains longer than
three years on any one kind of work and is debarred by military etiquette
from doing any manual labor, and consequently specialists and practical
men are the exception in the corps.
The lack of specialists in the army engineer corps is very evident from
the plans that have been adopted by different engineer officers for the im-
provement of the harbors subject to bar formation from current action.
At Charleston, 8. C, $144,700, were appropriated for the improvement
of the harbor previous to 1878, which was expended in dredging and other
tentative methods without any beneficial results. This item was then
dropped from the expenditure account and a new project formulated by the
engineer officer in charge, estimated to cost when completed $1,800,UI0.
This project was reviewed the same year by a board of engineer officers
(Two of whom have since been chiefs of the Corps) who approved the
plans and estimated the cost at $1,800,000 to $3,000,000, depending on the *
height it might be necessary to build the jetties.


51
Since 1878, $2,203,500 have been expended in carrying out this project
and in the last annual report of the Chief of Engineers it is estimated that
$3,132,000 will be required to complete the improvement, or apparently the
work is now $1,382,000 worse off than before anything was done. An ex-
amination of the latest charts of the harbor however, hardly justi-
fies this conclusion, as the present average depth of water on the bar
is approximately the same as in 1878, or in other words the project is
an utter failure.
The plan of improvement consists of two jetties of brush mattress
foundation about two feet thick with rip rap superstructure, one com-
mencing on Sullivans island and the other on Morris island, and
converging toward each other for a distance of about 12,000 feet from
shore and thence nearly parallel and about 2,800 feet apart, 4,000 feet to
the outer crest of the bar. The rise and fall of water surface for an average
tide is about five feet and for a spring tide about six feet.
The volume of water flowing across the bar for each tide was determin-
ed from a theoretical discussion of what the flow ought to be and not from
the observations made for that purpose. If the latter had been thoroughly
studied it is probable an entirely different plan would have been adopted.
Since jetties however far completed from shore must produce the same
effect through that section of channel as when carried to any greater
length, and as no material improvement of channel has occurred between
those portions of the jetties which have been in place for several years, it
is evident that to continue the present plans will produce no better results
in the future.
At Sabine Pass, Texas, from 1852 to 1882, $170,000, were appropriated
and expended in attempting to deepen the channel across the bar without
effecting any permanent improvement. This amount was mostly expend-
ed on surveys and in dredging, but as the bar is composed of very soft
mud the dredged channels disappeared in a few months after the work
was done.
In 1882 this item was dropped from the expense account of the harbor
and a new project devised estimated to cost when completed $3,177,606.50.
As this estimate of final cost was carried out to cents it is inferred that
much more certainty was felt in the final result than in that obtained from
former experiment.
The project consists or two jetties one 18,120 feet long and one 19,800
feet long, 4,000 feet apart at their junctions with the shore and gradually
converging to a width of 2,000 feet at the outer ends on outer slope of the
bar. There has now been expended on this project $125,000.00 with
results that indicate beyond a question of doubt that the depth of channel
expected will never he obtained under the present plans.
The jetties as far as constructed, are composed of brush mattress work
ballasted with rip rap stone, the earlier work being about one ton of rip
rap for seven cubic yards of brush and that put in more recently in build-


The Technic.
ing jetties to water surface, about one ton of rock for each one and one-
half cubic yards of brush.
During the past eight years portions of this work have been built above
ordinary gulf level on three different occasions but have settled and worn
away until very little of the jetties are to be seen now at average low tide.
A contract was recently let for expending $300,000 more on this work
all of which will be utilized in raising the jetties above average gulf level
by placing rock of one to five ton weight on the crests of the present jetties.
The bar is composed of very fine, soft mud into which an ordinary
sounding pole may be pushed by hand to the depth of ten to fifteen feet,
so it may easily be surmised what the result will be to place 70,000 tons
of rock on a structure already settling into the gulf bottom under its
present weight.
It is a fixed principle in harbor improvement by means of jetties that
the works as far as completed must produce the same results between
jetties as may be expected when carried to any distance farther seaward,
or in other words, the channel formed as the work progresses forms a basis
on which to predict final results.
The jetties now in place at Sabine Pass have been constructed suffici-
ently long that the channel between them has formed for itself a normal
section corresponding to the volume of discharge through the pass.
Whore the original depths were less than ten feet scour has~occurred, hut
where greater than twelve feet no increase of depth has been obtained,
showing that with the width between jetties adopted, twelve feet is the
maximum depth of channel that can be expected from natural forces.
Sabine Pass is from one-half mile to one and one-third miles wide and
varies in depth from 18 to 36 feet.
The channel of 18 feet and more in depth only averages about 500 feet
wide, and as the flow through the shallow portions of the sections is
greatly retarded by bottom friction the effective section cannot be con-
sidered over 1,000 feet wide.
During a considerable portion of each year the volume of discharge
through the pass is made up of the water from the Sabine and Xaches
Rivers and that due to tidal action. When the former is sufficient to till
the tidal reservoir as rapidly as the tide rises in the gulf the.flow is entirely
of river water, but when not there is often a current of salt water running
up stream at the same time that the lighter fresh water escapes seaward
as a surface current.
With jetties wider apart than width of effective cross-section of the
pass this will be the case much of the time and consequently very little
scour will occur even when the surface velocities indicate a heavy current.
If the width between jetties had been planned to accomodate HikmI
volu of the Sabine and Xeches Rivers the problem would have &lt;&gt;een
snmcwhut similar to that of the South Pass entrance of the Mississippi
River and a channel of at least 20 feet depth would have been secured.


53
No determination of current ■velocities and volume of discharge were
ever made on which to base plans. Without this data the matter of deter-
mining width for jetty channel was necessarily a guess, and in this case
has proved to be a very expensive one.
At Galveston, Texas, the folly of the so-called "Tentative" methods
of engineering of the Engineer Corps has been fully demonstrated.
The pass between Galveston island and Boliver point forming the en-
trance to the harbor has a surface width of about 9,000 feet, with an
effective width of about 4,000 feet and the distance of outer edge of the
bar from shore about five miles. To make a deep water channel across
this bar submerged parallel jetties 12,000 feet apart (Four times the width
of the effective cross-section of the Pass) were recommended with the ex-
pectation that the currents developed by tides having a mean rise and fall
of only one and one-tenth feet would have sufficient force to scour the
sand from the bar and transport it into the deeper waters of the gulf.
From 1870 to 1880, $618,432 were expended on this project and it was
then abandoned, the works having disappeared in the sands of the gulf
without producing any beneficial results.
The jetties at the mouth of the Mississippi River, under the direction
of competent Civil Engineers having in the meantime proved a great suc-
cess, it was decided to adopt the same system of construction for the work
at Galveston.
From 1880 to 1883, $959,568 were expended on this new project without
securing any improvement in the depths on the bar.
The citizens of Galveston becoming dissatisfied with the expenditure
of such vast sums without results, requested the late Capt James B. Eads
to submit a proposition to enter into a contract to secure a 30 foot channel
on the plan of "Deep-water or no pay." Capt. Eads after a careful exam-
ination offered to enter into a contract to obtain a permanent 30 foot
channel across the bar for the sum of $7,750,000.
The government engineers however maintained that with $750,000
they could complete this project and give a 25-foot channel across the bar
inside of two years, and on this representation succeeded in defeating
the bill in Congress. No further appropriations were made for this work
until 1886 and in the meantime the Teredo had eaten the brush of the
mattress work to such an extent that not ten per cent, of the original work
remained.
The fact that the physical characteristics of the Mississippi River with
its heavy annual discharge of sediment were entirely different from those
of Galveston harbor now dawned on the minds of the Engineer officers
and a new plan was devised.
The new project contemplated building two jetties 7,000 feet apart
(nearly twice the effective cross-section of the Fass), to be constructed of
ordinary rip rap stone to the water surface and then capped with heavy
block rock of one to ten tons weight, and estimated to cost when com-


The Technic.
pleted $7,000,000. Since then $800,000 have heen expended in carrying
out these plans and a contract was recently let, under which, if ever com-
pleted, the balance of the work required will cost $7,000,000 more. To this
if we add $400,000 required for office and engineering expenses during the
progress of the work we have the grand total of $8,200,000 for accom-
plishing what a private individual agreed to do for $7,750,000 and guaran-
tee results.
The defects in the present plans are,—incorrect location of the jetties,
excessive width of cross-section, and the fact that in ten lineal miles of
loose rip rap jetty work the loss of water from leakage will he so great
that there will be no scouring force at the outer end of the work.
With jetties, 7,000 feet apart 30,000,000 cubic yards of material will
have to be removed from the bar to produce the channel expected, which
distributed in front of the jetty entrance, would produce a shoaling of
three feet over an area of ten square miles, and as the slope of the gulf
bottom beyond the bar is only one foot in three thousand the probable re-
sult is evident.
At the mouth of the Mississippi River the Engineer Corps expended
$2,014,000, without securing any beneficial results whatever. The work
was then placed in the hands of competent civil engineers, who, in less
than four years time opened up a permanent channel 33 feet deep at a
cost to the government of $5,250,000 and a net profit to themselves of over
$2,000,000.
This project met the united opposition of the entire Corps and it was
no fault of theirs that they did not succeed in rendering it a failure. These
jetties have now been completed twelve years and have sustained no
damage from storm, except to the concrete coping wall of the east jetty,
which was not properly designed to resist the shock of heavv seas. The
writer rebuilt this sea wall in 1889, and in the report of the Chief of
Engineers for the same year will be found plates, illustrating the plant
and devices used in the work, but in the explanatory notes no statement
that would lead the casual reader to infer that the devices had an origin
outside of the corps.
At the mouth of the Rrazos River, Texas, the Corps, after having
used appropriations amounting to $158,000, abandoned the enterprise as
impracticable, witli not a single yard of jetty left in sight to show for this
vast expenditure.
The engineer officer in charge in making his final rejiort in 1887 says
the forces of the river are not capable of scouring a channel to exceed ten
feet in depth, and that the attempt to maintain six feet would be a doubt-
ful experiment.
ThiH stream has a drainage area of over 40,000 square miles and :it
flood stage has a discharge of 60,000 cubic feet per second. There are,


55
however, no records to show that the physical characteristics of the stream
were known at the office when the above report was made.
In 1888 private parties obtained a charter from Congress, granting the
privilege of opening up a deep-water harbor at the mouth of the Brazos,
without expense to the government. Although the Corps had officially
abandoned this project as impracticable, they did everything possible to
defeat the measures in Congress, but were not successful.
Work of construction was commenced in 1889 and a channel 26 to 30 feet
deep has been obtained and maintained through all completed work, and
across the bar there is to-day deeper water than at any other point west
of the Mississippi River.
Financial troubles have delayed the completion of the work over a year
since the commencement, in 1889. So that the above results have been
obtained in a little over a year of actual work. The project consists of
two parallel jetties of 560 feet clear width, constructed of brush mattress
work ballasted with stone.
About one ton of stone was used for ballasting five cubic yards of
brush. The brush work is built so as to be, when compressed, at low
water level, and when thoroughly constructed is to be capped with a con-
crete wall built in place, and weighing about two tons per lineal foot.
New methods of construction were devised by the writer, while
engineer in charge of this work, by which the expense of construction was
materially lessened and the rapidity with which the work could be done
greatly increased. These methods have since been adopted and are now
being used by the chief engineer of the jetty work at Tampico, Mexico,
and also in a modified form by two officers in charge of the harbor work
on the Pacific Coast.
At Aransas Pass, Texas, $581,250 have been expended in an attempt
to deepen the channel across the bar, to a depth of 20 feet. No appreci-
able result has been obtained, except to narrow the surface width of the
Pass 1700 feet, thus making the problem a much more difficult one than
before any work was done. The project, as tried, was to construct two
parallel jetties of brush and stone (2000 feet apart), from shore to the
outer crest of the bar, and depend on tidal action to produce the necessary
scour to cut channel across the bar. The effective width of the channel
through the pass is only 500 feet, or about one-third of that proposed
between jetties.
The government has now abandoned the work and a private company
have procured a charter and propose to open up a deep-water harbor
there, at their own expense. Owing to financial difficulties, no work of
construction has as yet been started.
The harbor at Grand Marais, Michigan, on the south shore of Lake
Superior has all the natural characteristics, if properly utilized, to make
one of the finest harbors on our lake coasts. The government has at-


The Technic.
tempted to construct a harbor of refuge there, at an estimated cost of
$450,000, but which, under the plans adopted, will at best prove but a
doubtful experiment.
The harbor consists of a natural indentation of the coast line, about
one and one-half miles long, with a drift formation of sand and gravel
extending about two-thirds its length between the harbor and lake. The
plan adopted is to build two crib piers, 300 feet apart, at right angles to
the gravel spit, out to 24 feet of water, and then dredge the channel between
to required depth.
Up to the present time $203,600 has been expended on the project,
but as yet no better channel has been secured than that at the natural
entrance of the harbor. In 1882, a channel 12 feet deep was dredged be-
tween the piers and across the gravel spit to deep water in the harbor, but
inside of one month after completion a single storm completely closed the
opening. In 1889 the channel was dredged again to a depth of 17 feet
between the piers, which during the following winter shoaled to 9 feet.
The river and harbor bill for 1890 contains an item appropriating
$2,000 to remove obstacles at the mouth of Squan River, N. J. This para-
graph of itself would attract no attention, but when we consider that the
so-called obstructions cost the government $39,000 and were caused by
the construction works placed there under the direction of the engineer
corps comment is unnecessary.
If the improvement of harbors was open to competition, there is no
question but that the civil engineers would accomplish the work for much
less than it now costs, and that too on the principal of results or no pay.
It seems strange that this state of affairs should have existed as long
as it has, but members of Congress are at last beginning to realize that a
change must be made, and when that time comes, the graduates of our
technical institutions should be prepared to conduct the works placed in
their charge in a manner creditable to themselves and to the profession
they represent.

THE ELEMENTS OF LEAST SQUARES.
BY W. W. CAMPBELL, B. 8.
CLA8S OF '86.
1. The errors to which all observations are subject are divided into
two classes,—systematic and accidental.
Systematic errors are those which affect all observations of the same
quantity made under the same circumstances to the same extent. As such
may be mentioned: an error in the measured length of a line obtained by
a tape, whose length differs from that of a corresponding standard tape,
or of which an erroneous co-efficient of expansion is used; an error in the
time of transit of a star over a wire, due to the fact that the observer
habitually notes the transit too soon or too late. These should be investi-
gated first of all and their effects eliminated.
Accidental errors are those whose presence in observations cannot be
foreseen or prevented. They are due to a very great number of causes.
As such may be mentioned: the imperfection of the eye and judgment of
the observer in making a bisection, or of the ear in estimating small inter-
vals of time; sudden changes in the parts of an instrument due to varying
temperature, wind pressure, etc. It has been found that this occurrence
follows a definite mathematical law; and it is to the investigation and
elimination of them that the method of least squares applies.
2. To understand from the outset the nature and requirements of the
problem to be solved, let us consider the following example: A 300-foot
steel tape was compared with a standard measure at different tempera-
tures and furnished the data—
TEMPERATURE. LENGTH.
43 Fahr. 299.9928 feet.
55 300.0160
69 300.0401
76' 300.0534
It is required to determine the length of the tape at 50° F., and the expan-
sion for a rise of 1°.
The systematic errors were eliminated by applying the known correc-
tions for the standard measure.


The Technic.
Let A = the length of the tape at temperature 50°,
B = the expansion for a rise of 1°,
I — the length of the tape at any temperature r.
If the length varies directly as the temperature each observation furnishes
an observation equation of the form
A + (r — 50°) B = I. (1)
Substituting the values of r and I given above we have
A — 1 B 299.9928, (a)'
A + 5 B = 300.0160, (6) I
A + 19 B = 300.0401, (c) | (
A + 26 B = 300.0534, (d) J
Here we have four equations from which to determine the values of
the two unknown quantities. If the observed temperatures and lengths
and the assumption of a linear function (1) were absolutely correct, these
equations would be consistent and any two of them would give the exact
values of A and B. But they involve the unavoidable errors of observa-
tion and are only approximately consistent.
From the four equations six combinations of two each can be formed,
and by solving them we get six sets of values of A and B. They are:
EQUATIONS.

It will be seen that these results can be regarded only as approxima-
tions, and that the true values of A and B cannot be found. Evidently
the larger the number of observations the more nearly should we approach
the true values. The question then is how to combine a large number of
observations so as to obtain the most probable values of the unknown
quantities, and what are most probable values.
If we substitute the values of A and B obtained from (a), (b) in the
four equations (2), (a) and (ft) are exactly satisfied, but (c) and (if) are
not, and leave small residuals. If we substitute in succession the six sets
of values of .1 and B in (2) we obtain the following residuals, which we
represent by !'.'
(a), (ft) (a), (c) (a), ((f) (6), (c) (ft), (d) (c), (d)

-.0021 -.0006 .0000 -.0013 .0000 .0000


From these residuals it appears that the third set of valves of A and
B most nearly satisfy the observations, and are therefore the best of the
six. But we shall see later that they can be further improved.
3. The value of an unknown quantity is obtained either by direct or
by indirect observation.
Direct observations are made at once upon the quantity whose value •
is sought. The measurement of an angle by a divided circle is a case in
point.
Indirect observations are not made upon the quantity whose value is
sought, but upon some related quantity or quantities. The desired quan-
tity is obtained by solving the equations expressing the known relations.
The determination of the length and expansion of the tape, § 2, is a case
in point. The measured qnantity I is here a function of both A and B.
4. The following fundamental principle of Probabilities are proven
in Algebra:
(a) . If an event may happen in a ways and fail in 6 ways the proba-
ta
bility of its occurrence is - ^ —y. If an event is sure to happen, 6=
0 and j/=l. If an event is sure to fail, a—0 and y=0. All probabilities
lie between 0 and 1.
(b) . If the probabilities of the happening of each of ft single events
are 1/1,2/2, . . . . j/n, respectively, the probability of all happening is Y=
yi, y* ■ ■ - yn.
(c) . If an event may happen in several different ways the probability
of its happening is the sum of the probabilities of its happening in each
of the separate ways.
5. The theory of the method of least squares is based on the axioms:
(a). The most probable value of a quantity of which several direct meas-
urements have been made with equal care, is the arithmetical mean of the in-
dividual measurements.
(6). Positive and negative errors are equally probable.
(c) . Small errors are more frequent than large ones, that is, the proba-
bility of an error is a function of the magnitude of the error.
(d) . If a very large (an infinite) number of observations were made the
arithmetical mean would be the true value of the unknown quantity. This is
really a result of the first three.
6. Let z be the true value of a quantity of which m,, m2, . . . . mreare
the individual values obtained by observation. The errors of the ob-
servations, x,, xt, . . . . xn, are given by
mx — z = xx , m2 — z = x2, ■■ ■• mn — z = xn . (3)
According to § 5, (a), the most probable value of zis

The probability that the errors will all happen is, § 4, (6),
Y = VnV* "" yn=f(x, )/(£,) ••••/(.!•„). (7)
The most probable value of z is that which makes the probability F
a maximum, and therefore the derivative of Y with regard to z is e&lt;]ualto
zero. Taking the logarithms of both members of (7) and differentiating
we obtain

The integration of which gives

From 5 5, (r) it appears that as the magnitude of an error x increases
the probability of its happening decreases. The constant k is therefore
negative. Putting i k = — h', (10) becomes
y=f(x) = ce n *■ (U)
It remains to determine the constant c. All possible values of the
error .r lie between 4- oc and — oo. Theoretically, any of these values
may occur, though practically errors above a certain finite limit w Hi not
occur. The probability that an error lies between these limits is the sum


61
of the separate probabilities, § 4, (c). It will certainly lie between these
limits, and the symbol for certainty is 1, §4, (a). Therefore

which is the equation of the error curve. It has been derived for the
special case of one unknown quantity. But the law of the occurrence of
errors, that is, the form of the function /, is evidently the same whether
the observations are made directly upon one quantity or upon a function
of several quantities. The equation (13) is therefore perfectly general.
7. In the same way that (12) was formed we can show that the
probability that an error x lies between — I and + I for a given series of
observations is given by

If these probabilities are equal we have hi = h' I'. The limit I varies in-
versely as h. If, for example, h — 2h', we have V 21; that is, an error
of a given magnitude in the first series will have the same probability as
an error of twice that magnitude in the second. The relative accuracy of
the two series is expressed by h: ti; and h and K are called the measures
of precision of the series.
8 It is more convenient to express the accuracy of a series of obser-
vations by means of the probable error. If the errors made in a set of ob-
servations be arranged in the order of their numerical magnitudes, that
error which stands at the middle of the series is called the probable error.

Let r represent it. Since the number of errors greater than r is equal to
the number less than r, the probabilities are equal that an error will be
greater or less than r. The probability that an error lies between — rand

By successive approximations to the value of h r we find
h r = 0.4709, (16)
which is the relation between the probable error and the measure of pre-
cision.
9. The accuracy may also be expressed by the mean error of an ob-
servation which is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of
all the errors. Let e represent it. In a series of n observations the num-
ber of errors equal to x is n y, since the number is proportional to the
probability of its occurrence and the whole number of observations.
Therefore, by definition,

z is the true value of the quantity; the first term to the second member is
the arithmetical mean, and the second term is the error of the arithmetical
mean. Let ec represent it. By transposing and squaring,
n" eQ2 = (^'i + Xi + .. .. xn)'2
= (xl* + 'xt* + . . . . Xn1) + 2 (X, Xi + xl Xi + ■■ ■■ xn _i xn).
Since positive and negative errors occur with equal frequency, §5, (6),
the last term is zero, or very small, and we may write
n* e,,2 = z,2 + xt* + ■■ ■■ xn2 = \xx}.* (20)
By the definition of the mean error of an observation, § 9,

That is the probable error of a single observation is to the probable error
of the mean of n observations as v n : 1.
11. Thus far we have supposed that the true value z and the true
errors x can be found. This cannot be done, however, except by making
the number of observations infinite, § 5, (d). Let
Zc = the arithmetical mean of the mean observations;

The small residuals v,, vt, ■■ ■■ vn differ from the true errors x,, x1} ■■ ■■

Then
Xi = v, + e0) Xi = Vi +e„, ■■ ■■ xn = vn + e0.
Squaring these and adding,
[xx] = [v v] + 2 [v] e0 + n e03.
The factor [v] is equal to zero, by (4). Therefore

12. We are now prepared to test the theory on which (13) is based,
by applying it to an actual problem.
Bradlev made a series of 470 observations of the right ascensions of
Sirius and Altair. The most probable sight ascensions were found and
the residuals formed by subtracting the most probable values from the in-
dividual results. We shall assume that 0".05 is the average value of all
residuals between 0".0 and 0 ".1; 0".15 as the average of all between O'.l
and 0".2; and so on. The numbers of residuals of the several magnitudes
are given in the second column of the table below. The third column is
the square of the first. The fourth is the product of the second and third,
and the footing of the column is the sum of the squares of all the residuals,

n = 470 [v v] = 76.6350 n = 470
Substituting n and [v v] in (25) we find r = ± 0".275, and therefore
from (16) h = 1.753. The number of residuals lying between — a and -
a is, § 9,
2 n h f i ° h* r*
ny=-^JL e ~h x dx. (28)

Now to find the number of residuals which should (theoretically) lie
between 0". 0 and ± 0".l. substitute n = 470, h = 1.753 and o - 0.1 in
(28) and integrate. * We find n y = 92.
The number of residuals which should lie between 0".l and 0'.2 is
found by integrating (28) between the limits 0.0 and 0.2 and suhtrartintt
the intcgeral for the limits 0.0 and 0.1. Similarly, the theoretical number
of residuals for the other limits are found. They are tabulated iu the last
column of the table. The agreement between the computed number ami

the actual number is very striking, though no more so than would be ex-
pected in any carefully executed set of observations.
13. The solution of a problem by the method of least squares is
based upon the above principles of the occurrence of errors, and the solu-
tion must be regarded as satisfactory in so far as the residuals in the prob-
lem are distributed according to these principles.
We may observe that no amount of manipulation can produce good
results from poor observations.
14. We have assumed that all the observations are equally good. But
it usually happens that the observer places more confidence in certain of
the observations than in the others. The most accurate ones must have
the greatest weight in determining the value of the unkown quantity.
Thus, if one observation is as valuable as two other poorer ones com-
bined, we give a weight 1 to the first and a weight $ to each of the other
two.
The difference of weights may result from a great many causes: such
as the relative skill of two observers, the relative accuracy of the instru-
ments employed, etc. These must be taken into account when the weights
are decided upon.

15. We have investigated thus far the problems relating to one un-
known quantity. It will generally happen that the observed quantity m
is a function of two or more unknown quantities, as in the problem of § 2;
and every observation will furnish an equation of the form
/ (z, w, t, ....) = az + 6 w + et+ - •■ = m, (32)
in which z, w, t, ■■ ■■ are the unknowns, and a, b, c, ■■ ■■ . are constants
furnished by theory.
For every observation there will be an error x, the probability of whose
occurrence is y. The probability of the simultaneous occurrence of the
errors x,, .r2, •• •• xn is, § 4, (b), and (13),

most probable values of the latter. The most probable values of the
errors make Y a maximum; that is they make
.r,2 + Xj1 + .. .. .in'1 = a minimum.
The most probable values of the unknown quantities are therefore thote which
make the sunt of the squares of the errors a minimum; hence the term Least
Squares.
In practice the errors x become the residuals v, and the condition
becomes
Vn* = [v v] = a minimum.

If the observations were perfect, any three of these would furnish the

satisfy any of the equations exactly. Let very approximate values of the

Similarly, from (40) and (41) we obtain
. [ab]z + [bb]w + [bc]i = [bm], (43)
[a c] z + [6 c] w + [c c] t = [c m]. (44)
These are called the normal equations They are equal in number to the
unknown quantities, and their solution by any of the processes of Alge-
bra will give the most probable values of z, 10 and t.
It thus appears that to reduce the n observation equations to the nor-
mal equations: we multiply each observation equation through by the
coefficient of z in that equation and take the sum of all the products for
the first normal equation; multiply each equation through by the coefficient
of w in that equation and take the sum of the products for the second
normal equation; and so on for the other unknown quantities t, etc.
To illustrate the application of these formula let us find the most pro-
bable values of A and B from (2), § 2. To avoid dealing with large num-
bers we replace A by 300 + z, and the equations (2) become
z — 7 B =—0.0072,1
z + 5B =+0.0160,
z + 19 B =+0.0401,
+ 26 B =+0.0534.
Multiplying each equation through by the coefficient of z in that equation
(1 in this case) and taking the sum, we find
4 2 + 43 B =+0.1023. (46)
Multiplying these by — 7, +5, + 19 and + 26 respectively, and adding
the products we find
43 z + 1111 B =+2.2807. (47)
Solving (46) and (47) we find
z =+0.00602, B =+0.00182.
and therefore
A = 300.00002.
If these values were substituted in (2) they would leave residuals such
that the sum of their squares would be less than that given by any other
values of A and B,
17. For convenience in eliminating the unknown quantities and for
computing the probable errors of the results, a special form of elimination
due to^Gauss is used. We have to solve (42), (43) and (44). From (42)

we can write
[a a\ [a a\ [a a]
Substituting this in (43) and (44) and writing
[6 6]— -J—[ [a 6] = [6 6.1], [6 c] - -^-1 [a c] = [6 c.l],

[6 m]—-[a m] = [6 m.l],

['■ c]- j^-J- [a r] = [e --.1], [c m] - [a m]=[c m.1], )
we obtain
[6 6.1] w + [b c.l] f = [6 m.l], (50)
[6 c.l] m&gt;+ [c cl] &lt; = [c m.l]. (51)
From (50)
[6m.l] [6 c.l]
w, = [yxr]-[T7u]i- (o2)
Substituting this in (51) and writing
[c c.l] -[-^-^y [6 c.l] = [c c.2], [cm.l] - [6m.1] - [c m.2J, (53)
we obtain
[c c.2]. I = [c m.2],
and therefore
&lt; = f^# (54)
[c c.2]
We can now find w from (52) and z from (48).
Following the above method we could readily, write out the formula
for eliminating four or more unknown quantities.
To illustrate the application of the above formula let us assume that
the length of the tape varies also as the square of the temperature. The
general equation (1) takes the form
A + (t — 50") B + (r — 50")'' C = I, (55)
and the observations give, first replacing A by 300 + z as in $ 16, B by «

1111 z + 24217 w + 590323 f = 50.6217, J
Comparing these with (42), (43) and (44), and substituting the value*
of [6 6], [a 6], [a a], etc., in (49) we find
[6 6.1] = 648.75, [6 c .1] = 12273.75, [6 m .1] = 1.180975,
[c r .1] = 2S1742.75, [c m .1] = 22.207875.

The most probable length of the tape at any temperature r is given by
&amp; = 300.0062 + 0.00187 (t — 50") — 0.0000027 (t — 50")5.
18. It remains to consider the probable errors of the results just ob-
tained. It can be shown that the weights of (, w and z are expressed by
?(0 = [ce.2],?M = [ii.l]|^,?W = [a«] [*
in which
[cc .1] ' ' v' 1 J [6 6] [cc.l]

[CC.l]a = [CC]--t['A [6c],
and the other quantities are defined as in § 17. Their values have been
computed in the process of elimination. • .
If the most probable values of the unknown quantities be substituted
the observation equations and the residuals v,, rit ■■ ■■ vn obtained, it
can be shown that, the mean error of a single observation is given bv
1^
(59)
in which n is the number of observation equations and q is the number of
unknown quantities. The probable errors are then given by
r = ± 0.674 6 -■ (60)
V P
In the problem of § 17 the weights are found from (58) to be
p (t) = 49535, p (w) w = 113, p (z) = 1.9.
Substituting the values of z, w and f in (56) we obtain the residuals
—0.00018, +0.00050, —0.00070, +0.00030;
and the the sum of their squares is [e c]=0.000009020. Substituting this
and n = 4 and q = 3 in (59), we obtain
e = ± 0.003003.
Substituting p (t),p (w) and p (z) for p in (60), we have the probable errors
r (() = ± 0.0000091, r (w) = ± 0.00019, r (z) = ± 0.0014.
An increase in the number of observation equations would cause a rapid
decrease in the probable errors.

19. If the observations are of unequal weights it can be shown that
the observation equations must first be multiplied by the square roots of
their weights. The normal equations are then formed and the elimination
made as before.
20. The method of least squares is of great utility in a very large
class of engineering problems; the adjustment of angles, the discussion of
level observations, etc. We can call attention only to one.
The U. S. Lake Survey observers placed a theodolite at a station 0 and
made a large number of readings on the stations A, B, C, D and E. The
following measured values of the angles were obtained:
A 0 B = 44° 25' 40" .613, C 0 A = 279" 12' 27" .619,
A 0 C = 80 47 32 .819, DOE = 62 37 43 .405,
B OC = 36 21 51 .996, E 0 A = 125 00 18 .808.
C 0 D = 91 32 24 .758,
There are five simple angles, A 0 B, B 0 C, C 0 D, D 0 E and E 0 A
Their sum must equal 360°. We may consider that the first four are the
unkown quantities. Let Z:, Zlt Z3 and Zt represent them. From the ob-
servations we can write
300°—(Z, + Z3 + Z* + Zt) = 125 00 18 .808.J
The solution of these equations would give the most probable values
of the angles. It is preferable, however, to deal witli smaller quantities.
For this purpose assume z,, r,, z, and z4 as slight corrections to be applied
to the above values of Z^, Zt and Z4,so that
300" — (Z, + Zt)

Zi = 91 34 24 .758 -j- **•
Zi = 62 37 43 .405 + ■*«■

Substituting these in (61) we obtain
z, = 0" .000,1
z, + z„ = + 0 .210,
za = 0 .000,
z3 = 0 .000,
(63)
z, + z2 = — 0 .228,
z4 = 0 .000, |
z, +za + z3 +z4 = + 0 .420, J
The normal equations formed from these are
Their solution gives
*i = Zi = + 0 ".022.

and therefore the most probable values of the measured angles are, from
(62) and (61),
AOB = 44« 25' 40".635,
AOC = 80 47 32 .653,
BOC = 36 21 52 .018,
C 0 D = 91 34 24 .884,
C OA = 279 12 27 .347,
• D OE = 62 37 43 .531,
E 0 A = 125 00 18 .932,
The sum of all the angles is exactly 8 right angles, as it should be.
The probable errors can be found as before.

PROBLEMS IN CURVES.
The following problems have come up at different times in the writer's
experience and although the solutions may not be new they are original.
In the first, the line had been surveyed as shown by B E F G and it was
afterward found desirable to do away with the reverse curve. The whole
distance was through thick standing pine trees rendering it impossible to
see from B C to G.

THE EFFICIENCY OF INCANDESCENT LAMPS.
The following data and curves have been calculated and plotted from
observations made in connection with our theses. As will be seen from
the curves of the four lamps plotted the five curves for each lamp tell the
distribution of light, the shape of filament and its position in regard to
the photometer.
The standard of light used is a Methven screen which has been stan-
dardized by comparison with different standard candles. The standard
burner used gives 2.1 candle power as the mean of a large number of ob-
servations taken.
The photometer is a Bunsen, 600 centimeters long, graduated with
half centimeters. In all our observations, except in one case of two lamps
of high candle power the length of photometer used was only 500 cm, the
standard burner located at 0 centimeters and the lamps to be tested at 500
cm. Both the standard burner and the lamp under test are thoroughly
screened so that no diffused light reaches the eye of the observer.
The socket with the lamp under test is screwed on the end of a brass
rod which is free to slide or rotate in a sleeve fixed in the centre of and
perpendicular to a disc of brass. Set screws are provided for clamping
the rod in the sleeve. The disc has notches every nine degrees and the
lamp rotates in the horizontal plane. Another disc is set in the lamp hold-
er parallel to the. plane of the lamp and the framework is so arranged that
the lamp with the other disc may revolve about this second disc. The sec-
ond disc has notches every ten degrees and the frame carries a pawl which
serves to hold the lamp at any angle desired.


The Technic.
The apparatus is set with the horizontal axis perpendicular to the line
of the photometer and on a level with the center of the paraffined disc;
the verticle circle being adjusted to read 0° when the lamp is vortical with
the socket underneath, then the horizontal disc is placed at 0° and the rod
carrying the lamp moved till the plane of the shanks is perpendicular to
the line of the photometer and the horizontal axis cuts the filament mid-
way of its length. This position of lamp is the "standard position" and
the photometer reading gives the standard power. By means of the hor-
izontal circles any desired degree of longitude can be turned towards the


photometer and by the vertical circle any desired degree of latitude.
Flexible wires connected directly to the socket are used for current leads
and another set is used for measuring tbe potential at the lamp terminals.
The current was taken by a Thompson-ammeter, and the voltage was
kept constant by resistance coils and read by a Weston-voltmeter.
The value used for each position was the mean of rive readings in the
horizontal position, and the mean of three readings in the other positions.
Horizontal distribution is measured by candle power readings at each

Vertical distribution is measured on each of four complete meridians
—those of 0°, 45", 90°, and 135° on the equator.
Mean spherical candle power is computed from 38 readings selected
from those already described with the aim of obtaining the average inten-
sity of light in alljdirections.

The values for these positions are selected, added and divided by 38.
Horizontal reduction factor is the mean horizontal candle power di-
vided by the standard reading.
Spherical reduction factor is the mean spherical candle power divided
by the standard readings.
In the curves plotted the rated candle power is denoted by full circle,
the spherical candle power by dotted circle and the horizontal candle
power by dashed circle.
The investigation was carried on in the following manner. First, the
current that the lamp required was read. Second, the difference of
potential at the lamp terminals was read. Third, the required photo-
meter readings were taken.
From these results the following table was computed, showing the
combined results for eight lamps:

In addition to these results it is necessary to know three more things
in order to decide which lamp is the best and the cheapest to use:—1st,
cost of new lamps; 2nd, life of lamp wdien burned at proper voltage; 3rd,
fall of candle power due to increased life of lamp. We have no means of
computing the last two. Fredrick S. Richmond, '91

DIRECT INDIREOTS.
As in the case of the directs only the most important part of the
original data sheet is given in the following table.
"No Meter" means that the top of the indirect was entirely open.
"Box and Meter" means that a box was fitted on the top of the indirect


The Technic.
and a hole was out in the top-of the box, just large enough to have the
air-meter fit in it, thus forcing all the air to go through the meter.
In these tests the direct indireets were set up as an ordinary radiator
and were not connected with the cold air duct.

EXPERIMENTAL WATER MOTOR FOR MECHANICAL
LABORATORY.
In making a series of tests for the determination of the efficiency of
various kinds of Hardy Gurdy, or Tangential water motors, it was found
that a slight variation in the relative position, or adjustment of the buck-
ets and nozzle was capable of producing a great difference in the efficiency


The Technic.
of the motor; and in order to determine the conditions under which a
given form of bucket would give the best results, a special form of motor
lias been designed, and built, in the shops of the Engineering Laboratory.
The aim has been, not to make a motor for commercial purposes, but one
which cau be adapted to any conditions likely to arise in making tests of
different forms of buckets and nozzles.


85
Any form of bucket and any number of buckets up to thirty can be
used. By means of graduations and adjustable parts and special graduated
gauges all positions of buckets and nozzle can be determined and recorded
in the note-book used in keeping the record of the tests so that all the
data for a given test is available for reference at any time. This makes it
possible to reproduce the conditions under which a test is made, some-
times a great convenience as a check on the work.
The wheel itself is a mere skeleton, the rim being made of two brass
rings, with a continuous slot between them. The buckets are not placed
directly on the wheel but are fastened to brackets or arms which can be
set at different angles with respect to a radial line on the wheel. Each
bucket is fastened to its bracket by a single screw, a straight lug on the
bucket fitting a notch in the bracket. The brackets are held in place by
T headed bolts fitting the slot in the rim of the wheel.
When the buckets are in place the diameter of the wheel is 16 inches;
and the buckets being 1 inch wide makes the diameter to center of buckets
15 inches.
The angle of the bucket face is adjusted by a gauge, having a gradu-
ated arc and a guide which fits along the face of the bucket-bracket.
This gauge is shown at A in the sectional cut; Plate 2. The distance be-
tween the buckets is regulated by the gauge B, which has one end bent
at a right angle to fit into a hole in the center of each bolt holding the
bucket-brackets.
The nozzle has three different movements, and each has its graduated
scale so that the exact adjustment can be noted without measuring. The
nozzle tube has a longitudinal movement in a telescopic joint, which allows
the nozzle to be brought up close to the buckets so as to obtain the full
force of the jet. The vertical slide permits the nozzle, with all the ar-
rangements for holding it, to be raised or lowered; and as the nozzle guide
is supported on trunions, and moved by the hand-wheel beneath, it is
possible to direct the jet to any desired part of the bucket.
The horizontal and vertical scales are graduated in tenths of an inch
and have verniers reading to hundredths. The arc on the trunnion is gradu-
ated in degrees and the vernier reads to tenths of a degree.
The motor is set up in the Experimental Department of the Engineer-
ing Laboratory. The water pressure is obtained by means of a 6 inch x
4 inch x 6 inch Gordon Duplex Steam Pump, having 2% inch suction
and 2 inch discharge. The water is pumped from a 150 barrel cistern
just outside the Laboratory into a steel pressure tank, 2 feet in diameter,
7 feet long. From this tank the water is taken through a flexible rubber
hose to the motor, and returned again to the cistern by the waste pipe.
The expansion joint and balancing piston or end of hose allow a free
movement of the nozzle tube.
When the pump is started the discharge is closed and thus all the air


The Technic.
contained in the tank is confined, and as the pressure increases the air is
compressed in the upper part of the tank. This serves as a cushion and
aids in keeping the pressure uniform.
In order to maintain a constant pressure, a Curtis Pump Pressure
Regulator is attached to the steam pipe and a small pipe connects the
tank with the pressure diaphragm of the regulator. This arrangement
works so admirably, that, after the regulator is once adjusted the pressure
in the tank does not vary to exceed %, of a pound, although the steam
pressure may greatly exceed the pressure maintained in the tank. Directly
underneath the motor is placed the weighing tank on a platform scale,
and the waste-pipe of the motor is provided with a three-way cock, so
that the water, when desired, can be turned into the tank instead of into
the waste pipe.
By this arrangement the energy of the water, or gross work, is de-
termined. If the time is noted when the cock is turned so that the water
runs into the tank, and also the time noted when the water is shut off
from'the tank, the weight of the water collected during the interval,
divided by the number of minutes gives the weight of water used per
minute, and this multiplied by the number of feet head (obtained by
multiplying number of pounds pressure by 2.31) gives the foot-pounds of
work per minute which the water is capable of doing.
To measure the work actually done by the water in the motor, a
simple form of friction brake is used. The brake wheel is a straight faced
pulley with flanges on each side. The brake band is a strip of spring steel
% of an inch wide and .014 of an inch thick. The strap has one end at-
tached to a spring balance, it is then given one turn around the pulley and
the other end has a rod with a large head for holding weights. The fric-
tion of the brake-strap on the upper half circumference of the brake wheel
causes nearly all the weight to be carried by the wheel, while the part
not thus carried is indicated by the spring balance; and this tare weight
subtracted from the weight hung on the lower end of the brake-strap gives
the net weight. The weight rod and the part of the strap encircling the
upper half of the wheel and extending down to the weight rod is made to
weigh exactly one pound; and known weights are added as more load is
desired.
The number of revolutions per minute is measured by a speed-counter,
supported on a bracket fastened on the frame of the motor and connected
with" the motor shaft by a flexible wire shaft. This speed-counter has a
clutch stop motion and a watch movement, for regulating the time during
which the clutch is in contact. By touching a spring the clutch is con-
nected and the time train started at the same instant; at the end of a
half-minute the clutch is thrown out and the time train is stopped auto-
matically. Although the counter runs but a half-minute it is so geared
that the dial indicates the number of revolutions per minute.


87
The number of foot-pounds of work done per minute is found by mul-
tiplying the circumference of the brake (= w [diameter of brake wheel +
thickness of brakestrap]) by the net weight on the brake and by the
number of revolutions per minute. This net work divided by the gross
work of the water gives the efficiency of the motor.


The Technic.
In the preparation of this apparatus for making tests, great care has
been taken in calibrating the instruments used, so that all errors may, as
far as possible, be avoided. From the experiments thus far made the
indications are that the results will be very satisfactory. In making a
test of a bucket the experiments are commenced with the buckets placed
radially, the nozzle horizontally, and at such a height that the jet strikes
the center of the bucket. The load which gives the greatest efficiency is
determined; and then with the load remaining the same the position of
the nozzle is changed while the effect upon the speed is noted. In this
way the best nozzle position for every position of the buckets is obtained
and in the series of tests the best adjustment for both buckets and nozzle
is found.
Tests are also made with different heads while the buckets remain
the same, so as to determine the best size of nozzle for a given bucket,
and a given head. It is the intention to make tests on several forms of
buckets. The first were made on the simple flat vane. The Pelton Water
Wheel Co. have furnished a set of their buckets, which, together with
other styles that are to be made and tested, it is hoped will afford much
new and valuable data on the action of this class of water wheel.
C. E. DePi y, 91.
NOTE ON THERMOMETERS.
In the calibration of the thermometers used in the tests on steam
radiators a very interesting point was met with. The steam thermometer
used in the tests was of the usual form with the bulb in a steel cup of
mercury and the graduations on a brass scale; the cup being screwed
into the steam pipe. While the thermometer was in the steam pipe with
the steam blowing through at zero pressure the thermometer read 212° as
it should.
After the radiator tests were finished a water test for boiling point
was made, using as a standard one of H. J. Green's best thermometers.
Just as long as the flame was kept under the dish, so that the water was
boiling, the two thermometers read 212 degrees.
The bulbs of the two thermometers were now placed in a bath of cyl-
inder oil which was heated up to 400° and allowed to cool down. The
oil was well stirred so as to keep it all of uniform temperature but in spite
of this the Green thermometer read 3° higher than the other at points
every ten degrees between 370° and 180°, while if the oil was not stirred at
all the Green thermometer read 10° higher than the other. This was re-
peated three times to make sure of the result.
The result is at first startling, but it seems clear that, as there is no
source of heat supplying heat to the oil, the brass case of the one ther-
mometer carries the heat away so fast that the temperature of the oil in
contact with the metal cup is actually reduced below the average tempera-


89
ture of the whole bath of oil, even while the oil is being stirred, while the
Green thermometer having no metal about it and its bulb directly in the
oil does not cool the oil as fast and consequently registers higher.
This seems to indicate that measurements of temperature of a fluid
whose temperature is varying is a very uncertain operation and that prob-
ably the most accurate way of calibrating such a thermometer at points
above 212°, is by placing it side by side with a standard, in a steam pipe
where the pressure and temperature are constant.

NOTES ON LINING SHAFTING.
We are indebted to a graduate of the Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology for the following scheme for lining shafting
which we think may be as serviceable to others of our readers as
it has been to ourselves.
A number of pieces of board are notched at A to fit over the
shaft S and a hole M N is cut in the other end, then by means of
a plum line, each piece being hung over the shaft the point T
(which may be of tin or simply a pine head) is located so that
the distance A T is the same on each piece. By hanging these
pieces of board over the shaft at different places and so adjust-
ing the shaft that the points T will all come in line when sighted
by the eye, the shafting will be properly lined.

ENGINEERING SOCIETY BANQUET.
We would call attention to the new custom started by the Society this
year of holding an annual banquet.
Many doubts were expressed about the probable success of a banquet
"with no one but engineers to make the speeches."
Neverthless a committee was appointed and after some delay invita-
tions and tickets were issued for the "First Annual Banquet of the Engin-
eering Society" on Friday, May 1st, 1891; and at 9:30 P. M. on that even-
ing four Professors two alumni and forty students sat down to a fine sup -
per at Hangsterfers.
When after an hour the tables had been considerably lightened Pres.
Tuthill arose and delivered a short Address of Welcome after which he
introduced Mr. P. H. Richardson the Toastmaster of the evening. Twelve
toasts were happily responded to and it was one A. M. before the last
round of applause died away and the company left the hall. All
went home convinced that even engineers can make successful speeches
and that the "Engineering Society Banquet" had come to stay. The only
disappointment was the unavoidable absence of President Angell and
Professors Cooley and Davis.
It is hoped that in future years there may be a larger representation
of alumni present. The following is the program in full:

EDITORIALS.
The slight increase in the length of the printed page of the present
volume of The Technic is not an intentional change from the form adopt-
ed by proceeding boards of editors, but a mistake on the part of the pub-
lishers which was not noticed till after several forms had been run and the
type distributed. It was the intention of the present board to follow
closely after the preceeding issues. The precedent, established by the first
number, of prefacing each volume with the portrait of some member of
the Engineering faculty gives us the opportunity of presenting to our read-
ers the portrait of Professor J. B. Davis and, by so doing, of showing to
him in a way our appreciation of his interest in Our welfare. Instead of
the usual group of buildings, we present for an inset the portraits of five
of the most widely known professors who have been, or are now, connected
with the University faculty. Though not strictly members of the Engin-
eering faculty they have always shown deep interest in our society and its
publication and have willingly responded whenever called upon for advice
or assistance in any way. With the hope that the book as a whole will be
of some interest and practical value to our readers, we present for your
consideration The Technic of 1891.
* * *
The present board began to collect material in the latter part of Feb-
ruary and started in with the intention of having The Technic of 'i)l pub"
lished before commencement week. The result is known ; owing to delays
over which we could have no control we are several weeks later than the
date set; and while we do not intend to imply that it is impossible to have
the publication ready by the time memtioned above, we have come to some
conclusions which it might be well for future boards at least to consider.
We think the time of publication should be changed from the end to the
beginning of the college year. Any original investigations made in the
laboratories or in connection with thesis are not generally completed till
near the end of the year. If the attempt is made to have The Technic out
by Jane 15, all copy must be in by June 1 at the latest; even if the data
are all at hand they have not been properly worked up by this time. By
October however everything would be ready for use and results would he
more satisfactory than if hastily prepared for publication. On the other


93
hand it would be too long to wait till the end of the following year. Again,
the members of the board, being all seniors but one, are liable to be very
busy with their own work toward the end of the year and cannot give
proper attention to the work of publishing. Besides they often leave be-
fore the end of the year—thus making the board too small or necessitating
the election of new members. If the publication was begun in October
and finished by December or January the difficulties would be avoided and
The Technic would reach a large number of persons whom it does not
now reach at all. With the new testing machines recently set up in the
laboratories and with other increased facilities for original investigations,
The Technic will in the future probably contain more of this original
work by undergraduates than it has contained heretofore; in fact it
should become more of a record of the work of the Engineering Depart-
ment and of the Engineering Society than it has been for the past year or
two. In view of these facts the question of the time of publication be-
comes an important one which should be considered at the out set by next
year's board.
* * *
During the past year the society has completely changed the require-
ments for graduate membership. While the text of the constitution is not
available.for publication the following is the substance of the sections.
All Engineering Alumni previous to the class of 1891 became graduate
members of the society without further dues when the amendment was
passed.
Any Engineering Alumnus of 1891 and following years, may become a
graduate member without further dues, on the payment of four dollars,
less what dues he paid as an active member of the society. (The dues
are one dollar per year, for undergraduates).
Any former student in any department of the University (other than
an engineering graduate) may become an associate member of the society
on the payment of five dollars, less the amount of dues already paid as an
active member of the society.
All graduate and associate members are entitled to have a copy of the
Technic mailed to them each year, free of charge, provided they each
year furnish the society with their correct address.
It is hoped that by furnishing all graduates with a Technic that they
may be thus induced to take a more active interest in the society and its
work.
* * *
During the past year the Mechanical Laboratory has received the fol-
lowing valuable gifts. A No. 4 Hydraulic Ram, from the Gould's Manu-
facturing Co. A " Sure Grip" Steel Tackle Block, from the Fulton Iron
and Engine Works. A 1% inch Horizontal Centrifugal Suction Pump,
from the Baldwinsville Centrifugal Pump Works. A 2 inch Low Capacity


The Technic.
Water Meter, from the Thomson Meter Co. A Rotary Power Pump, from
the Silsbey Manufacturing Co., and several other things.
* * *
These gifts appear in two lights: One wherein the usefulness of these
machines to the student in making various tests is shown, and a second
in which there is seen a benefit to the donors in that the student, who
may become a future employer or superintendent, is familiarized with
the workings and excellencies of these gifts, and will remember these
firms when he comes to order machines of this kind. We hope that our
friends who read this will reflect upon both of these benefits, and if occa-
sion offer may go and do likewise.
* * *
The Technic is indebted to the following publications for the courtesy
of an exchange:
"School of Mines Quarterly," School of Mines, Columbia College;
"Technology Quarterly," Massachusetts Institute of Technology; "The
Stevens Indicator," Stevens Institute of Technology, "Journal of the En-
gineering Society of Leigh University," "Journal of the Association of

gineer's Club," University of Illinois; Selected Papers of " The Rensselaer
Society of Engineers "; and also, to the Reports of the State Societies of
Arkansas, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan and Ohio.
* * *
Criticisms on the work of the Engineering Society and suggestions as
to changes and improvements iu it must often occur to graduate members
of the society who can compare the work done here with that of other
societies with which they may be connected. It seems hardly necessary
to say, and yet we do not wish to close the present volume without saying,
that such criticisms and suggestions will always be gladly received. All
communications should be addressed, Engineering Society, Lock Box 46,

Sibley College, Cornell University,
Ithaca, N. Y., March 12, 1889.
Gentlemen:
It gives me great pleasure to say that the instruments sent us have
proved to be of the most excellent quality, and, so far as our work has
given us opportunity to judge, of great accuracy. We have used them
on all kinds of work, and at speeds of rotation up to 300, and have found
them capable of doing admirably. The finish is excellent, and the sizes
and fits all that could be asked. They have been very useful, both in
class work and in making engine trials, and eminently satisfactory in all
respects. "We have had no difficulties with them except such as have
come from their use by inexperienced hands. When used for instruc-
tion an occasional accident is to be expected. They have withstood
such injuries quite as well as we ought to expect, and have done more
and better work, even in such hands, that I had supposed possible.
Very respectfully yours,
R. H. THURSTON, Director.

PROFESSOR HENRY S. CARHART.
Professor Henry S. Carhart was born at Coeymans, Albany County,
New York, March 27th, 1844. During the early years spent on his
father's farm the district school furnished the principal means of
intellectual growth within his reach. Sometimes a college man was
employed as teacher, and this afforded an opportunity to study the
university algebra and other subjects outside the ordinary range of
instruction. All such chances were eagerly improved, and at the age
of sixteen young Carhart was himself the teacher, and was already
■looking forward, with slender means but indomitable determination, to
a college course.
At the age of nineteen, we find him at the head of a Quaker school
a few miles from Poughkeepsie, teaching and earning means to com-
plete his preparatory course at the Hudson River Institute at Claverack.
In a little more than two years he had read the required Latin and
Greek, the latter in a single year, and had prepared in mathematics,
largely by teaching the subject to pupils older than himself. In the
summer of 1865 he was examined and admitted to Yale College, but at
3


The Technic.
the opening of the college year entered the Wesleyan University at
Middletown, Connecticut, from which he was graduated, as valedic-
torian of his class, in 1869.
After graduating he was employed for two years as teacher of
Latin at Claverack. He then sought again the congenial atmosphere
of college life. This time it was the Yale Divinity School, with its
corps of honored names and the spirit of classical learning lingering in
the quiet shade of the old elms, that claimed and held for a season a
willing devotee. The subtle charm of the place and its traditions, with
the pr'eserree^and-influence of such educators as Fisher, Dwight and
Porter, might well have detained for a longer time the young divinity
student—still young, though with the experience of manhood gained
through years of responsibility. But during the single year spent at
Y^le~ the advantages offeredby ther Sheffield Scientific School proved
too strong an attraction to be resisted. The work in German, in
particular, under Professor Whitney, seems to have been one of the
factors that finally turned his thoughts and purposes away from
Hebrew and theology towards the teacher's life and scientific pursuits
to which he has ever since devoted himself.
—In 18.72 Mr, Carhart accepted an appointment-in the Northwestern
University at Evanston, first as instructor, but the next year as Professor
of Physics, which Chair he continued to fill until appointed to the Pro-
fessorship of Physics in the University of Michigan in 1886. Owing to
the lack of sufficient resources, the institution at Evanston was then
unable to make adequate provision for scientific work, and for a time
the Professor of Physics was obliged to add instruction in Chemistry to
the legitimate duties of his department. For this work additional
preparation was sought in the summer school of Chemistry at Harvard.
The fourteen years of his connection with the Northwestern University
witnessed an almost phenominal development of the physical sciences,
partially indicated by the fact that at the beginning of that period the
physical apparatus of the institution consisted of an exhausted air
pump, with a small stock of similar accompaniments, while its close
witnessed the erection of a superbly constructed and well furnished
laboratory, at a cost of forty-five thousand dollars. Changes rela-
tively quite as great have taken place here in the few years that have
elapsed since his taking the chair of Physics in the University of
Michigan. The meager outfit, sheltered on the fourth floor of the
jnain building, with a single instructor in charge, has been superseded


11
by a modern and in many respects model, laboratory, fully* manned
and equipped
In 1881, while still at Evanston, Professor Carhart was granted leave
of absence for a year, which he spent abroad. He first attended the
Paris Exposition of Electricity as one of the International Jurors of
Award for the United States, after which his time was chiefly given to
study and experimental work in Helmholtz laboratory at the University
of Berlin. While thus engaged he undertook an investigation having
for its object the determination of the relation between the electromo-
tive force and the density of the zinc sulphate solution in a Daniell cell.
The methods adopted and results obtained were recognized as consti-
tuting a contribution to science and were widely copied in such publica-
tions as those of Lord Rayleigh, Mascart et Joubert, Wiedemann's
Annalen, the London Philosophical Magazine, and Everett's "Units
and Physical Constants." This work is of further interest as being the
beginning of what he has since developed, into the production of a
standard cell for the measurement of electro-motive force, more perfect
than any that has hitherto been devised. It is now in use in the best
physical laboratories of the United States, including those of Harvard,
Johns Hopkins, Columbia, Princeton, and the Universities of Pennsyl-
vania, Wisconsin and California.
The reputation incident to the successful completion of such a piece
of work, added to that based on many years of exact experimental
research, has naturally resulted in Professor Carhart's often being called
upon in cases involving large interests and requiring the judgment of
an expert in electrical science. Partly owing to the same causes,
though still more to his ability as a teacher and organizer, the depart-
ment of electrical engineering, recently established in the University,
has attracted students in such numbers that the physical laboratory is
already taxed to its full capacity to accommodate those who wish to
avail themselves of its advantages.
As a teacher and worker in science, Professor Carhart is distin-
guished by concentration, clearness and exactness. His students are
accustomed to say that his experiments never fail, which is of course
equivalent to saying that a clear brain, a skillful hand, and a " scientific
conscience" have initiated and controlled them. Yet, while occupied
with the absorbing duties of his own department, he has given careful
attention to educational problems and has been among the foremost to


The Technic.
bring into prominence the disciplinary value of scientific training. He
has been quick to recognize the fact that scientific education, to rest on
a sound basis, requires special preparation, not provided for in the old
method of "preparing for college," and it is chiefly due to his personal
convictions and influence that a knowledge of Physics is now required
of classical students, as well as others, as a part of their preparation for
admission to the University of Michigan. As a member of the Commit-
tee on Physics Teaching of the American Association for the Advance-
ment of Science, he joined with Professor Mendenhall and others in a
report on this subject published in the Proceedings of the Cleveland
meeting in 1888.
In response to urgent appeals, Professor Carhart has devoted a
share of his time to work for which few are adapted, that of giving
scientific instruction in popular form. He has delivered popular
illustrated lectures at Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Chicago and New York,
besides many smaller cities, and at this writing is engaged upon a
course of University lectures at Grand Rapids. He has for years
been an active member of the American Association for the Advance-
ment of Science. In 1889, at the Toronto meeting of the Associa-
tion, he delivered as Vice-President of Section B, the customary
address, choosing as his subject a "Review of Theories of Electrical
Action." The paper is a remarkable illustration of the interest with
which such a subject may be invested when the obscure problems of
physical science are skillfully translated into the language of popular
thought.
Professor Carhart has been a frequent contributor to a number of
leading scientific and technical journals, among them the American
Journal of Science, London Philosophical Magazine, Popular Science Monthly,
Science, the Journal of the American Electrical Society, and London Elec-
trical journals. Not to enumerate at length, the following titles of
articles in the first-named journal will serve to indicate a few of the
subjects to which he has given special study: Relation between the
Electromotive Force of a Daniel Cell and the Strength of the Zinc
Sulphate Solution; Relation between Direct and Counter Electromotive
Forces represented by an Hyperbola; On Surface Transmission of Elec-
trical Discharges; An improved Standard Clark Cell with Low Temper-
ature-Coefficient. He has recently published a work on Primary Bat-
teries, which presents in compact and accessible form the hitherto


13
widely scattered literature of this subject and adds much original
matter.
Contributions such as those already named, together with his long
familiarity with the practical applications of electricity, render pecu-
liarly fitting the appointment which he now holds as Secretary of the
World's Electrical Congress. He will visit England the coming summer
for the purpose of completing necessary arrangements for the work of
the Congress at the Columbian Exposition.
The marriage of Professor Carhart, in 1876, to Miss Ellen M. Soul4,
at that time Dean of the Womans' College of the Northwestern Univer-
sity, brought to him the companionship of a gifted and cultivated
woman, whose literary attainments and rare social gifts form a fitting
counterpart to his own scientific tastes and habits.

DIRECTION OF A LINE.
For needle compass work the following is sufficient: Fig. B is the
Pole Star, a Ursse Minoris, mag. 2. A is &lt;5 Ursse Minoris, mag. 4.5, next
to the pole star in the handle of the little dipper. C is 51 Cepheis,
mag. 5. D is 32 Camelopardalis, mag. 5.4.
The lines A C and B D intersect about 13 minutes of arc from the
pole measured on a line E F parallel to A D. The pole is towards the
side A B.
Set a light over a stake. At some convenient distance south of the
light fix the position of another stake by holding a plumb line in range
with the light and the pole. Estimate the position of the pole by the
found in thus laying down a north and south line nearer than the
needle can be read without a vernier.
The two stars in the inner corner of the little dipper that are the
more prominent, namely, 19 and 21, or 19 and i, Ursse Minoris, are 25J
minutes of arc apart.
For something more precise one may use the process of the pre-
cise method given below and make the observations by means of a
suspended plumb line, and a compass sight, or by the plumb line
and peep sights cut in chips forced into a cleft stake and inclined to
cover the star at its elongation. The practice can be readily adapted
to the means at hand when once the method is understood, as given
below.

vertical, or nearly so, no allow-
ance for the 13 minutes need be
made. Otherwise make allow-
ance accordingly for the distance
of the pole from the intersection
of A C and B D. Repeat the
trials any number of times and
take the average of the positions
obtained for the final place for

Some knowledge of the names and relative positions of stars is
needed. This is best obtained from one of the planispheres now pub-
lished or from some good star map of the north polar region. Whitall's
Planisphere, or Harrington's Planisphere, published by the Register
Printing and Publishing Company, of Ann Arbor, Mich., or R. A.
Proctor's Star Atlas, are good for this purpose.
There will also be needed a table of the Apparent Places of Fixed
Stars, such as is given in the American Ephemeris or some similar work.
This book also furnishes some other data that may be needed by a
beginner in preparing for the observations. After some experience, no
such book will be needed before making the observations (only after-
wards for the reductions), so one can observe at once without any
previous calculations.
Observe the following conditions and notation. It is presumed that
the observer has a knowledge of the elementary astronomical terms in
common use, the kinds of time, and the use of the ordinary mathemat-
ical tables, such as Hussey's, published by the company above men-
tioned.
&lt;t&gt; = latitude of place of observation.
3 = declination, rf0, &lt;5,, 62, etc., for particular stars, and &lt;5m the least
declination that can be used.
a = right ascension, a0, au a2, etc., for particular stars, am the least
and a„ the greatest value of a that can be used.
( = hour angle with same subscripts as a, —i» = 6 hours.
h = altitude with similar subscripts.
T = astromical time of any observation, that is, its time from noon,
with similar subscripts.
i'0 = " Siderial time of Mean Noon " at "Washington for the date of
the observation, taken from the table headed "Solar Ephemeris" in the
American Ephemeris. In case some other ephemeris is used, as that

down the times in the order of their succession with the names of the
proper stars against them, their magnitudes, and a note of their elonga-

looking them up again.

It may be noticed that h„ must be considerably larger than * in
order for the instrument to be used at all. The work of preparing such
a list can readily be abbreviated. With some experience a list may be
written at once without figuring. When continually at work at the
same place the list may be extended from day to day by simple inspec-
tion. The changes in the values of a,„ and a„ depend upon the change
in the value of vv The change in 2 is mainly due to the change in r0.
The extreme detail in the above work is for a novice,—not as an
example of practice. Western elongations are to be preferred for the
smaller field instruments, because, if the star can be observed before it
reaches its elongation it can be seen at its elongation. The data used
being approximate, it may happen that a star at its eastern elongation,
may pass a little too high for the instrument.
Provide some means of illuminating the cross wires so they can be
seen at the same time the star is. Instruments of the more precise
grades intended for night work, and mining instruments, are fitted with
apparatus for this purpose. The common engineers transit for field
use generally is not. For such an instrument, tie a piece of unglazed
white paper (common newspaper) over the objective by a string around
the telescope tube back of the lens, with a hole in the paper centrally
over the objective. This hole may be from \" to J", according to the
size of the lens and its aperture. Light shining upon the outside of this
paper will render the cross wires visible. A lantern with a lens throwing
light in one direction is best. The common lantern may be made use
of by nearly surrounding it with something to shut off the light. The
light must not shine in the observer's face. It must therefore shine
obliquely from the side upon the paper over the objective. It is possi-
ble to observe without an assistant, but difficult. The paper over the
objective is a protection to it. The light may be toned to any faintness
within the telescope by withdrawing the lantern or changing the
obliquity of the beam of light. The lantern will also be used to read
the plate. It must not be held too near the plates or its heat may
change the readings.


19
Choose some point of the line whose direction is sought, or refer-
ence line, from which a clear view of the stars to be observed may be
obtained, for an instrument point. Fasten a lantern at some other
point of the reference line to sight to. A common lantern about a mile
away will do very we'll. If necessary to have it nearer, a fainter light
may be made by covering part of the lantern globe. This light should
be faint enough to look about like a faint star, so that no change of
focus of the objective-will be required.
In good season for beginning the observations, set up the instru-
ment over its point of the reference line. Sight to the distant lantern
■on its point of the reference line. In time for the first star, illuminate
the cross wires and set the line of sight upon the distant lantern. See
that the spindle clamp is secure. Read the plate. Record the readings.
Release the plate clamp. Focus the objective for the stars, if it needs
it, for which purpose the moon or a planet is useful. Point the tele«
scope at'the star to be observed and bring it into its field of view.
Illuminate the cross wires. Set the vertical wire, by means of the plate
clampland slow motion screw, on_the star. Keep this .wire on the star
very carefully as it approaches its elongation, winch may be known by
the increased time taken by the star to cross the wire. Follow the star
with the plate slow motion screw, keeping the vertical wire exactly on
it till it appears to pass directly along this wire. Presently it will leave
this wire and go to the same side it came from. Follow it no. longer
than till it passes directly along the wire. Read the plate. Record the
readings, marked for the star- observed. Point the telescope to the dis-
tant lantern. Illuminate the cross wires and set the line of sight again
upon this lantern by means of the plate clamp and slow motion screw.
Read the plate. Record the readings. Compare them with those before
observing the star. If they differ too much from them the observation
must be rejected. The amount of this difference depends upon the
instrument and the class of the work.
In time for another star, read the plate with the line of sight set
again upon the reference line and record the readings. Release the
plate clamp, point the telescope for the star, illuminate the cross wires,
and observe it as the first one was observed. Record the plate readings
for this star. Set the line of sight again upon the reference line by
means of the plate clamp and slow motion screw, read the plate, record
the readings, compare them with those before observing the star, and


The Technic.
thus examine the position of the instrument as to stability. So do for
every star observed.
Observe at least three stars jn this way that give good observations,
and as many more as may be desirable or possible.
The observations are reduced as follows: Find, from the plate
readings on the reference line and those for each star, the angles
between the vertical circle of the reference line and those of the stars
From these angles find half the angle between the vertical circles of a
pair of the stars. There are two cases: when the vertical circle of the
reference line is between the stars, and when it is not. In the first
instance, take the half sum of the horizontal angles, in the second, their
half difference. If the stars were at the same elongation, that is, both
2? or both W, this will be £ (A0 — At) in the equations below, if one is E
and one W, this will be £ (A0 + AJ. Take from the Ephemeris the
-apparent declinations, d0 and &lt;5,, of these stars for the date of the obser-
vation. By means of the following equations, using the proper one,
compute £ (.40 + .4^ or £ (A0 — At), as the case may be:
Tan £ (A0 -f At) = — tan £ {A0 — .4,) cot £ (&lt;50 + &lt;5,) cot £ (&lt;!„ — &lt;),).
Tan £ (A0 — AJ = — tan £ (A0 + At) tan £ (&lt;f„ + &lt;?,) tan £ (o0 — &lt;J,).
Having thus obtained £ (A0 + Ax) and £ (A0 — ^4,), find A0 and A,.
These are the angles from the meridian to the vertical circles of the
stars. Apply these values of A0 and Al to the horizontal angles from
the vertical circle of the reference line to the vertical circles of the stars,
first above directed to be found, to get the horizontal angle from tbe
the meridian to the vertical circle of the reference line, or its direction.
Notice how these values of A0 and Al must be applied in order to give
the quantity sought. The two values found for the direction of the line
should be identical out to the last figure. If not it shows an error in
figuring which must be found and corrected.
Three stars must be observed in order to get a check up on the fig-
ures and upon the work both. In combining the observations as above
directed, those upon two stars at the same elongation having nearly the
lame 6 must not be put in the same pair, because cot £ (S„ — &lt;SX) will be so
large a multiplier for the errors of observation that the result will be
found worthless. By this method the observations may have any
interval of time between them. When reducing, use the apparent
declinations of the stars at the time when they were observed. This
fact permits all observations from the same reference line to be com-


21
bined. This makes the final result more trustworthy. The observa-
tions are combined in pairs. This gives the greatest number of results
from a given list of observations.
The latitude of the place of observation enters into the work only
in such a loose manner as to enable one to use this method where the
latitude is not known. After some experience it will not be needed at
all. The observations may be made at any time and reduced at any
other.
After the azimuths, A0! Alt etc., of the stars are found, the latitude
may be found by;
cos S„ cos (!, cos 6,
cos &lt;t&gt; — -—— = -: 7- = -:—-f- = etc.
sin A0 sin Ax sin A&gt;
This shows that the latitude may be found by the measurement of hori-
zontal angles alone.

three of them are taken as an example:

Final Azimuth of Line = 89° 55' 26".7.
As the plate was numbered from 0° to 360° in right handed rotation
and all angles read from the reference line round to the right, the
result is the angle from the reference line reckoned to the rightto the
meridian. Since the instrument looked to the northern portion of the
heavens this angle reads to the north point of the horizon and the
direction of this line is
N. 89° 55' 26."7 W.


23
The middle value of the azimuth of the line was rejected because
of its manifest error being some 3' 25" different from the others which
would exclude it from 10" observations. It is thus in error because it
was obtained from two stars at the same elongation whose declinations
were nearly the same. The calculations were given to show the worth-
lessness of such a combination. A more trustworthy value of this angle
from other sources is 89° 55' 30". By this one may perceive the value
of the middle result. While some discrepancy appears in the original
readings the final result is quite good. The changes of temperature the
parts of the instruments experience in night work out of doors with
lanterns held close to them works mischief with the readings, and calls
for constant back readings on the reference line.

&lt;p = 42° 16' 33."1
More trustworthy value from other sources,
0 = 42° 16' 30".
By this may be perceived the value of the method. Had the obser-
vations and reductions been extended somewhat, no doubt very close
results could have been obtained.
It may happen that one may be provided with a comparatively
poor instrument yet need to determine the direction of a line with some
precision. Put the instrument in as good working condition as possible
and in as good adjustment as it can be. Observe a star with it as before
directed but use no reference line and read no angles. After pointing
to the star point downwards and set a stake marked for the star with a
point carefully marked on it in line. Do the same for two or more stars
setting the stakes as far away as convenient yet near enough for the
points on them to be well located. Reverse the telescope about both
axes and level up the instrument anew after observing each star. Make
notes showing the position of the telescope when pointing to each star.
In combining the observations in pairs place together two stars for
which the notes show the telescope to have been in its two different
positions. By so doing the imperfections of the instruments will do
less harm.


The Technic;.
If J, in the figure shows the place of the
instrument, C and. D, the stakes for two stars,
one at its E. elongation and the other at its W.
elongation, and J K the meridian, make the
following measurements carefully with a steel

• where x = CK
and y — K D, the segments of C D formed by
K, the point where the meridian from / inter-
sects C D, x + y = d. Find x and y and locate
the point K with the instrument and steel tape.
As a check on the figuring use
x a cos &lt;S0
y b cos (?!
Since A0 = C/JTand Ax = KID, CID = Aa + A.
Then Tan § (A0 — A1)= — tan £ (A0 + AJ tan J (&lt;S„ + \) tan J (-5,— &lt;*,)
as before when J0 and Ax become known and
cos &lt;5„ COS &lt;&gt;. , „
cos &lt;p —- —.—r- = -—j- as before,
sin A0 sin Ax
Whence it appears that one may obtain the direction of the meridian
and the latitude of a place without reading angles at all. A0 and Ax
may be found directly from the triangles CIK and KID. When the
stars are in the same elongation d = x — y and
, a cos &lt;5„ + 6 cos rf,
x + y — d r r r

Should D' be set in line from I to D so that ID' = IC = a, the figuring;
would be simpler. Measure C D' — d' and
x&gt; _ yi = _ d/ tan i (&lt;S„ + (J,) tan } (&lt;f0 — &lt;!,).
For stars in game elongation d' will = a/ — y' and

Here the same caution must be used about combining values of *
too near alike, as is noted in reducing by angles.

A GRAPHICAL METHOD.
It sometimes happens that an electrical engineer is called upon to
plan a system for the distribution of electricity in which the amount of
current required may be known in advance. For instance, should the
law require all wires to be placed in subways, the company, in whose
interests the engineer is working, would be obliged to do away with its
old lines and to lay new ones. These new lines should be so planned
that they may distribute current at the least cost to the company, con-
sistent with safety and convenience.
To Sir Wm. Thomson belongs the credit of having discovered the
simple law that the annual cost (interest and depreciation) of the con-
ductor should equal the annual cost of the power lost in it in heat. It
follows from this that the cross-section of the wire should be in direct
proportion to the current to be carried. It is the object of this paper to
give a demonstration of this law as applied to currents whose value is
not constant but whose variations are known; and by a graphical method
to show how the equivalent constant current may be determined.
The annual cost of distributing a certain current may be divided
into two parts. One includes items which are not dependent on the size
of the conductor used, such as salaries, right of way, legal expenses,
etc. The second includes items which are dependent on the size of the
conductor. It is evident that these last items alone are to determine
what is the proper size for the conductor. I shall assume that the cost
of the conductor in place is proportioned to the weight of the copper in
it. This is very nearly true for large conductors, though the error
increases considerably as the size of the conductor is decreased. I shall
also assume that the cost of the power wasted in the line is in direct
proportion to its quantity.
Let C equal the cost in cents of the conductor in place per cu. cm.
(1 cu. cm. = 0.00001 ton).

It is next necessary to find the value of - / i'2 dt; that is, to find

the average value of i2. To do this the engineer must have records of
the currents distributed by the old line. These records are preferably
in the form of curves continuously giving the output of current from
hour to hour during each day. If there are no such records, about all
that the engineer can do is to choose a conductor of such size that with
the maximum load it will not heat dangerously or cause too much fall

That is, the area of the cross-section of the conductor should be pro-
portional to the equivalent current which it is calculated to carry.
Let us now give numerical values to the constants of equation [3]
and see what would be the proper current density. R for copper is
about 0.0000016. Suppose electrical power to be worth S100 per H. P.,
per annum; then W would be about 14 cents. Suppose the conductor
in place to cost §900 per ton; then C would be about 0.9 cents. Lastly
take a as 15 per cent. Then
That is, the equivalent current density should be 75.5 amperes per
sq. cm.
This density for a steady current would mean a rise in temperature
of about two and a half degrees and a fall of potential of about twenty
volts per mile. But as the equivalent current is far from being the
maximum current, it is necessary to investigate the rise of temperature
and fall of potential when the current is a maximum. The rise of tem-
perature increases as the square, and the fall of potential increases
as the first power of the current; so if I is half of the maximum,
the maximum would cause a rise of ten degrees and a fall of poten-
tial of forty volts. Such a fall of potential would usually be too much
to allow for a two wire system; consequently the engineer must either
use feeders or arbitrarily increase the size of the conductor until the
fall of potential comes within proper limits, or else he must use a
higher voltage with three or more wires with or without feeders. What
he will do must of course depend upon circumstances, but let him
remember that a great deal of money might have been saved in many
of our cities had a little more been put into copper. Thompson's law
should be understood by every electrical engineer, and it will be found
that the " practical men " who say that it is of no use have, in the great
majority of cases, never taken the trouble to investigate it.

DEAD RIVERS.
Although the process of dissolution usually terminates the activity
and mundane usefulness of our fellow-man, and, after death, his ashes
are generally allowed a peaceful, undisturbed sojourn in the bosom of
mother Earth, the rivers which we are about to consider present a singu-
larly reversed history; in that they have only reached the zenith of their
fame, in their importance to mankind, many years subsequent to their
death and burial. Man and River! Their comparison is singular. The
man is born and, almost from his cradle, fights for recognition—
fame — riches; he dies and becomes a memory which a half-century
obliterates.
The nameless river flows carelessly in its channel, unknown and
perhaps unseen by human eye; it dies—is buried—and ages afterward
leaps to fame. It is the largest producer of the world's store of gold.
Though we are all, to some extent, interested in the accumulation
of gold, few of us ever think it worth the while to pay more than casual
attention to the conditions—geographical, geological and chemical—in
which it is found in the earth's crust; as long as gold—the synonym of
money or riches—is obtainable by our efforts. There are, however,
many facts connected with the occurrence of gold in nature which may
be of general interest, and the statement that probably three-fourths of
the gold produced in the State of California—or something like nine
hundred millions of dollars—has been yielded by them, may lend
interest to our subject—Dead Rivers.
In the above-named State these ancient and defunct rivers have
been most largely exploited for their alluvial gold, and there, conse-
quently, their geological history has been most thoroughly studied
For this reason we shall chiefly consider the history of the Dead Rivers
of California, as affording the most complete knowledge of the genesis
of their singular alluvial deposits.
It may be well, at this point, to consider in brief some of the condi-
tions under which gold practically originated, or is supposed to have
originated, with the idea of making clearer the manner of its segrega-
tion in the deposits of which our subject treats.


The Technic.
During the past few years many theories as to the genesis and
location of ore-deposits have been overthrown, and much has been
added to our knowledge of this subject. Gold has been found in the
most absurd places as regards former theories, so that we are less and
less inclined to restrict it as to its habitation. A terse and happy
expression now passes current: "Gold is where it is found."
Singular or, as far as known, isolated occurrences of gold, either
chemical or geological, are beyond the necessary scope of this article,
and we will only consider it as existing in quartz-veins under the name
of vein-gold, and in alluvium as placer gold, having sought these two con
ditions in the following manner.
Vein-gold is most frequently found in quartz which is enclosed in
metamorphosed rocks consisting of slaty deposits, frequently talcose,
sometimes chloritic or argillaceous, and which are generally referred to
the Silurian age. In California, however, these rocks have been proven
to belong to the Jurassic period. These Jurassic rocks, which now
enclose or form the "walls" of the quartz-veins, are supposed to have
originally carried the gold—having been impregnated by the auriferous
meteoric waters—and, in the process of their change, or metamorphism,
which was ascribable to and simultaneous with the phenomena result-
ing in the formation of the quartz veins, to have given up their store of
gold, which, by some process of segregation, then became associated
with the quartz as vein-gold. This theory as to the collection of the
gold in the quartz veins has many supporters, and it is true that the
slates still carry a little gold and may have carried much more. It is
difficult if not impossible for the human mind to conceive either of the
gigantic forces which, acting through long reaches of time, effected stu-
pendous changes of configuration during the earlier periods of world-
making, or of the vast areas of the earth's crust which were affected
by these forces and whose constituent rocks were metamorphosed by
the evolved heat and heated solutions. Hence, we are more ready to
accept the theory that the gold-bearing quartz veins were ejected as
such from a molten interior—a theory which may be applied to certain
cases as safely as the former.
The quartz-veins, once formed, suffered, together with their enclos-
ing rocks, the various vicissitudes due to sudden climatic changes and
changes of elevation, and, during ages of weathering, erosion and vol-
canic disturbance, were broken off to the level of their present outcrop*,
and such part of their denuded portions as became finely crushed was


31
carried off by the streams and rivers and deposited along with their
detritus to finally offer up its gold as placer gold.
It has been asserted as a singular fact that the fine-grained placer
gold usually carries a larger percentage of gold than the coarser gold,
and several theories have been advanced to account for this phenome-
non. One theory, which has been largely quoted, is that the smaller
particles of gold afford a larger proportionate surface than the coarse
gold or nuggets for the attack of sulphur acids formed by the oxidation
of pyrites, and consequently lose a larger percentage of silver. The
writer is inclined to think that the cause of the difference in fineness,
where any difference exists, should be ascribed to a difference in source of
the two grades of gold, since the smaller particles would naturally be
more at the mercy of flowing waters than would the coarse gold,
and would be carried farther. Sulphurets, or pyrites, are usually
found in gold-bearing rocks and gravels and should, by oxidation,
always exert a similar action upon the gold, rendering the smaller gold
the purer, so that, when we find placers where the coarse gold carries a
larger percentage of silver than the fine gold—a condition which does
occur—both the proposition and its explanation fall to the ground.
By this discussion of the origin of vein-gold and placer gold, we
have been somewhat diverted from the consideration of our ancient
rivers, but to them we will now return.
When the Jurassic rocks which enclose the quartz-veins of California
were in process of formation and consisted of alluvial mud, forming
the bed of the Pacific Ocean, California and a large part of the Grand
Plateau were washed by the Jurassic Sea " and peopled with its life."
At that time—ages before the birth of man—the Sierra Nevada formed
no barrier to the ocean and our western coast-line lay to the eastward of
that range as it now exists. During this period commenced a gradual
uplifting of the western coast, culminating, near the close of the period
in that grand upheaval which formed the majestic Sierra Nevada.
The fissures and cracks in the earth's crust which were formed by
these disturbances were filled with the auriferous quartz-veins, which
had their origin in the manner previously described.
Following the Jurassic came the Cretaceous period, which deposited
its limestones, sands and clays over vast areas to the eastward of the
Sierra Nevada and over the strip of land to the westward from which,
later ©n, emerged the Coast Range. A season of occasional subsidence
of the land was followed by renewed uplifting near the close of the


The Technic.
Cretaceous period, when, it is supposed, the uplifting was so great in
the Far North as to precipitate the cold Arctic waters into the Southern
seas, lowering the general temperature and largely destroying the life.
The Tertiary age succeeded; during which the lower levels of the west-
ern coast were covered by immense, fresh-water lakes which deposited
their mud to the depth of thousands of feet. Violent volcanic disturb-
ances occurred at various intervals, and, at the close of the Miocene
period, the great lakes were much contracted and the story of our
Ancient Eivers begins.
During all the geological periods which succeeded their deposition.
the quartz-veins, and their enclosing rocks alike, had been subjected to
the various dislocations consequent to local changes of level, volcanic
disturbances and abrupt changes of temperature, with the result that
large portions of them no longer existed in place but were distributed
broadcast as sand and gravel. The contraction of the Miocene lakes,
and the various changes in the configuration of the country at the close
of the Miocene period, apparently gave rise to conditions favorable to
the formation of rivers, which doubtless had their source far to the
northward and, flowing in a southerly direction, drained a large section
of country.
Their grades were steep and their currents rapid. Quartz boulders
twenty tons in weight have been found in their beds which were worn
as smooth as pebbles; doubtless they must have been carried for many
miles by the agency of a mighty stream. Immense quantities of gravel
and rock carried along by these turbulent rivers ground their channels
deeper and deeper, to be in turn broken up, ground to powder and
carried on to the sea or distributed in some open basin. Quartz veins
were eroded; the rivers cut their way down to the bed-rock slates, and
all the while a gigantic concentration of the precious metal was going on.
While the gravels previously produced by the decay of auriferous rocks
were being washed down into the rivers by their affluents, the rivers
themselves cut their way through gravels, auriferous rocks and quartz-
veins, ground up the rocks, washed off the lighter sands and deposited
the heavier grains at intervals along their channels as a golden sedi-
ment.
The eccentricities of these ancient rivers, although largely due to
greater and more frequent disturbances of the earth's crust than occur
now, are not so widely different from those of the rivers of the pfesent
day. In wide portions of a channel the heaviest detritus might collect


33
to form a bar over which the rocks and gravels would be subsequently
spread, filling up the channel until an increased flow of water cut
through the bar or around it. Volcanic disturbances have, in some
cases, filled up a portion of a channel, and, indeed, covered it with
many feet of debris; this would cause an abrupt deviation of the river's
course. Thus the rivers flowed; necessarily abandoning portions of
their channels at times, yet always leaving therein more or less of their
golden wash, until the chief agent in their final destruction began to
exert its influence, changing the courses of the rivers, decreasing the
velocity of their currents and everywhere causing the gradual filling of
their channels with their gravel and mud; this was the gradual uplift-
ing of the bed-rock upon which the rivers flowed. This uplifting finally
amounted to at least 2,000 feet, and we can readily understand how the
rivers would gradually deposit their heaviest alluvium, which, in turn,
would be gradually covered with the lighter gravels and sands, and
slowly but surely the channels would become filled up until, actively
speaking, they were channels no longer. We might expect to rind in
these deposits the heavier rocks and pebbles and the nuggets of gold
lying upon the bed-rock, covered by the lighter gravels, sands and mud,
in the order of their specific gravities, the upper portion of the deposit
carrying the finer particles of gold. Such an orderly deposition does
not, however, always—or even usually—occur; for, in places, some of the
large boulders are seen on top of the deposit; beneath these may occur
finer gravel and pebbles, separated frequently from lower beds of a
similar nature by layers of clay and cement gravel; but, in general, we
may say that the largest boulders and coarsest gold are found upon the
bed-rock.
Thus the rivers were gradually filling up as their fall was decreased
by the uplifting of the country over which they flowed.
As time passed on, some new disturbance may have covered miles of
a channel with earth or volcanic deposit, causing the river to seek a
new channel, sometimes parallel to the old one, where the work of dep-
osition of auriferous sands proceeded as before; and finally, at the close
of the Pliocene period, violent volcanic action took place which covered
large areas with lava and may be said to have termintaed the lives of the
ancient rivers, filling their channels and covering them from sight.
Later rivers passed,more rapidly, through similar histories; filling their
channels and changing their courses; cutting at times through the
ancient channels and re-distributing their gravel and gold. The dead


The Technic.
rivers, or, properly speaking, their channels are found today in isolated
fragments lying upon the ancient bed-rock, sometimes capped with
hundreds of feet of basalt or gravel, or both, while the present rivers
take their courses at right angles to the ancient flow. In the beds of
the dead rivers, as they are exhumed, are found pebbles of the various
rocks common to the Sierra Nevada, gravel, sand, clay, volcanic tufa
and fossilized wood, and besides—a noble content of gold. Fragments
of pottery have also been found, indicating the existence of man in the
Tertiary age. The rocky portion of this alluvium consists, in some
places, almost entirely of quartz. It is estimated that, in a portion of
the so-called Big Blue channel, sixty-five miles in length, there was an
amount of quartz equal to that contained in all the known quartz-veins
in the State down to the depth of one hundred feet. Throughout these
masses of gravel the gold is eccentrically distributed, and the immense
amount of the precious metal yielded by the dead rivers, indicates an
amount of erosion of gold-bearing rocks which is almost incalculable^
even when we allow the theory, advanced by a distinguished geologist,
that the eroded portions of the quartz-veins were much richer than such
portions of the veins as now exist. It might be said, however, that, if
the latter idea were fact, we might expect to find a constant diminution
in the percentage of gold in our ledges as depth is gained, which is not
the case.
It is true, however, that larger masses of gold have been found in
placer gravel than have ever been found enclosed in vein-rock, and that
these placer nuggets usually preserve an irregular form, similar to
small pieces of gold as seen in quartz. This form need not so persist-
ently occur had the nuggets of gold been formed by the precipitation
of gold from solutions and its collection about some organic nucleus.
The gold found in the dead rivers usually has a rounded, pebbly
appearance, which is doubtless due to the long-continued tumbling and
hammering it has received. It is of variable fineness, but usually is freer
from quartz than other placer gold.
It may be well to omit the discussion of the methods used in min-
ing and extracting the gold from the old river channels since those
methods partake of the characteristics of the ordinary methods used in
both placer mining and vein mining The existence of several frag-
ments of these dead river channels in the state of Oregon, part of
which have only lately been discovered, has led the writer to take deep-
interest in their singular deposits. One fragment presents the appear-


35
ance of a long ridge rising above the gulches on either side to a height
of from three to five hundred feet; its length is about one mile, its
elevation above sea-level about 5,000 feet, its mean depth from top to
bed-rock is probably two hundred feet and its mean width about the
same. The whole content of this channel consists of "wash " gravel;
rounded and smooth pebbles of various rocks—some foreign to the
county—being distributed throughout the mass from peak to bed-rock;
the whole mass, furthermore, apparently carries gold. The direction
of the fragment just mentioned is nearly north and south, while a
fragment of a similar—or possibly the same—channel, which has been
known for many years, in Baker County, Oregon, has a trend more
nearly east and west. This latter channel has been worked yearly dur-
ing the few weeks when the melting snow yields sufficient water, and
has yielded nuggets to the value of $1,500. It has also enriched certain
neighboring gulches (notably Gimlet Gulch) with the recent wash of
portions of the channel which have been broken off.

A MAMMOTH BUILDING.
[The following article was offered to The Engineering Magazine without our
knowledge and was accepted 1)3' that periodical after it had heen put in type by us.
Although by virtue of its copy-right that magazine has a prior right to the article,
the editor has kindly consented to its publication here.—Eds.]
The coming exposition of 1893 will present to the world one of the
greatest engineering feats yet recorded in history. Paris attracted the
attention of the civilized nations by her monumental Eiffel tower,
and now, not to be outdone by any previous exposition, Chicago
steps forward with the largest building ever erected, as her special
contribution to the wonders of the engineering world of the past and
present.
It is but natural that the Exposition should prove the foster-parent
of such mammoth structures as have been seen at the World's Fairs of
London, Munich, Vienna, Philadelphia and Paris; for the housing of
such collective exhibits as are brought forward at national displays,
necessitates the covering of immense areas, both to suit the classification
and to provide for the public convenience of display. London, in 18-31,
exhibited a Crystal Palace 1851 feet long and 450 feet wide, containing
900,000 sq. ft. of glass. The main oval-shaped building at Paris in 1867
covered 11 acres, while at Vienna in 1873 Machinery Hall had an area
of nearly 10 acres. The main building at Philadelphia was the largest
structure ever built up to that time for exposition purposes, covering
only a trifle less than 20 acres of ground, and this was followed by the
smaller though more remarkable Machinery Hall at the Paris Exposi-
tion of 1889, covering about 13 acres by means of the largest arch or roof
truss that has as yet been constructed.
And now the World's Columbian Exposition, to maintain the pro-
gression instituted by previous exhibitions, provides a building so vastly
beyond all preceding efforts, and of such engineering skill, that a word
in description may be of interest.
The classification of the exhibits for the Fair falls into twelve
groups, as indicated by the buildings shown on the map: Agriculture,
Horticulture, Live Stock, Fisheries, Mines and Mining, Machinery,
Transportation, Electricity, Fine Arts, Archaeology, Manufactures and


37
Liberal Arts. Each of these groups is presented in a special building,
with the exception of the last three, which are combined in the Manu-
factures and Liberal Arts building. And thus it is that we have need of
such a gigantic structure, for in it are housed the subjects of Archaeology,
Ethnology and the Liberal Arts, comprising music, science, literature,
etc., besides all the products of leading industries not included under
any of the other nine groups.
The Manufactures and Liberal Arts building occupies a most con-
spicuous position in the arrangement of the buildings, lying as it does
so near the waters of Lake Michigan, and separated from the gently
sloping stone beach of over a mile's length by only a broad avenue or
promenade, along which are scattered booths and tea houses of the
various nations, intermingled with music stands and floral displays. It
is in the Corinthian style of architecture and in design is severely class-
ical. Its form is rectangular, 1087 feet long and 787 feet broad, covering
a floor space of 30J acres. Hence its length is but a few feet short of
one-third of a mile, while a walk around the building measures only
300 feet less than one mile. Including the floor space of the galleries, a
total floor area of about 40 acres is found in this one building.
The building consists of a central ball 1280 feet long and 386 feet
broad, spanned by the largest steel arches ever built, rising to a height
of 210 feet above the floor. On either side of this hall comes a gallery
40 feet wide, then a continuous nave of 107 feet 9 inches span, and then
an outside gallery of 50 feet. Projecting from these galleries are 86
smaller ones, 12 feet wide, from which the visitor may view the sea of
exhibits beneath him. The galleries are approached by 30 great stair-
cases, 12 feet wide each.


The Technic.
The central hall has an area of 11 acres with not a single supporting
pillar to interrupt this vast expanse. It is calculated that under this
roof could be placed the Auditorium with its tower complete, and that
six such buildings could be placed lengthwise, and still find room, in
this inner hall of the ManufacturesfBuilding. Here, during the dedica-
tory ceremonies in October, seats will be furnished to 75,000 people for
the exercises proper, and on another day of the week of festivities this
vast expanse will serve as a ball-room for such a gathering as has prob-
ably never been seen before.
"Columbia Avenue," 50 feet wide, traverses the entire length of the
hall, and at its center it is crossed at right angles by a street of equal
width. Ornamental poles, bearing electric lights, will serve to light the
various aisles and avenues in the building (as it is contemplated to keep
the exposition open during all evenings), while large clusters of lights
will be suspended from the roof arches to illuminate the whole building.
Some 20,000 electric lights will be used in this structure alone.
I Passing down "Columbia Avenue," through one of the entrance
portals, and viewing the building from the outside, we see a continuous
series of huge arched windows running along the four facades. The
lower portion of these windows, between the level of the ground and
the gallery floor is left entirely open, thus forming a cool open loggia
or promenade directly under the gallery floor, which is about 25 feet
deep, where the crowds can enjoy the view and breezes of the lake, and
where 16 large cafes and 72 private dining-rooms, supplied by 8 hotel
kitchens, will administer to their wants.
In the center of each facade is a huge main entrance in the design
■of a triumphal arch, the central archway of each being 40 feet wide and
80 feet high. These portals will be surmounted by huge sculptured
eagles 18 feet in height, and above the side arches will be great panels
with inscriptions and sculptured figures in bas-relief. The corners of the
building also have great corner pavilions, forming arched entrance
ways, designed in harmony with the main entrance. Beautiful frescoes
will adorn these lofty passage-ways.
The exterior of this building, like all the rest, is to be covered with
■"staff "in highly ornamental designs. The seals of all the different
States will be wrought in distinct relief and immense size, and female
figures representing the arts and sciences will help to beautify the
exterior.
"Staff" is a French invention, though it is largely used at the pres-


39
ent time in all the principal cities of Europe. It was extensively
employed at both of the Paris expositions of 1878 and 1889, though not
to the extent that it is used in our own exposition. It is composed of
plaster, mixed with New Zealand hemp cut in lengths of about 6 inches
to give the plaster body and to make it fibrous. The desired ornamental
work, be it a cornice, frieze, bracket, pediment or statue, is first modeled
in the clay by expert modelers. When the clay is hard, a pliable rubber-
like mould is made from the clay model by means of liquid gelatine,
which hardens quickly. This mould can then be filled with the plaster
and water, packed in with the hemp fibre, as often as that particular
ornament is to be duplicated in the design. The plaster hardens in
about 25 minutes, when it can be taken out to dry thoroughly and the
process repeated. These slabs or ornamental pieces are then nailed to the
wooden furring of the building, the joints pointed up, and the whole
given a coat of some external wash to produce the desired effect. The
casts are of a milky white color, about one inch in thickness, and can be
made to represent marble, cut stone, rock face or carving. "Staff" is
both water and fire-proof, and if properly cared for will last well the
average age of a house.
The roof trusses of this building are the largest ever built. They
span 380 feet, rising to a height of 211 feet at the apex. The width at the
base is 14 feet, 30 feet at the hip, and 10 feet at the apex. There are 27
trusses in number, each weighing 400,000 pounds. They contain
1,600 tons more material than the Brooklyn bridge, and 400 tons more
than the Eads St. Louis bridge. Over 11 acres of skylight will be sup-
ported by them, or some 40 carloads of skylight glass.
There enters into the construction of this work of magnitude about
17,000,000 feet of lumber and 12,000,000 pounds of structural steel. The
lumber represents 1,100 acres of average Michigan standing pine laud.
The foundations, not including the piles, require 4,000,000 feet of lum-
ber, and 3,000,000 feet or over 200 car-loads of lumber are used in the
floor. Five carloads of nails were required to lay the floor alone. This
floor will seat 200,000 persons, giving each one over 6 square feet of
space, and, including the galleries, the building will seat 300,000 people,
or the entire population of Cincinnati. The standing army of Germany
could be massed inside the walls, or to compare it with our favorite
American sport, six games of out-door base ball could easily be played
in it at one and the same time. The building is three times the area of
St. Peter's Cathedral at Eome, or four times the area of the Ancient


The Technic.
Roman Coliseum. The cost of the structure will be $1,500,000. Its
architect is Geo. B. Post, of New York City.
A word, in conclusion, as to the nature of the exhibits in this build-
ing: The classification of the department of manufactures falls into 33
large groups, which are snbdivided into more than 200 classes including
products of all the leading industries and latest inventions. The
department of Liberal Arts, in the south end of the building, will fully
present the advancement and present state of education and learning
in all its branches—science, literature, music, religion, with all included
therein. Archaeology and Ethnology are, for the first time, to form a
separate exhibit. The educational department will cover 12 acres, which
is three times as much room as has ever been allotted to it in previous
expositions.
The department of Archaeology and Ethnology will form one of the
most interesting features of the entire display. Here will be exhibited
all possible traces of prehistoric man in America and the mode of life
of the people whom Columbus found at the time of his discovery.
Some of the phases of prehistoric existence will be shown by pictorial
representations, others by skeletons of men and extinct animals, and
still others by casts of all types of men in life color and native costumes,
together with a collection of the handiwork and arts of those primitive
times, especially types of their architecture and shipbuilding.
Much of this exhibit is to be obtained by new explorations, much
from private museums. The whole will be a most complete representa-
tion of the progressive stages of civilization and learning ever attempted
and will do justice to American* progress and research.

POSITION OF MAXIMUM BENDING MOMENT ON A
BEAM WITH CONCENTRATED LOADS.
When several concentrated loads, at fixed distances from one
another, pass across a beam, as when a locomotive traverses a bridge
stringer, the position of these weights which will cause the maximum
bending moment on the beam is given by the rule that the middle of the
span shall bisect the distance from the centre of gravity of the loads then on
the span to the adjacent wheel. Those readers familiar with the use of the
equilibrium polygon for determining bending moments will readily see
that the maximum moment will then be found at that wheel. If the
centre of gravity falls between two driver weights, it may be necessary
to try two positions in order to ascertain under which of these two wheels
the maximum moment is found.
A demonstration of the above rule may be made as follows:
Denote the weights by Wj, W2, W3, etc.; the distances between them,
beginning at the left, by a, b, c, etc.; the reaction at the right support by
P; the resultant of all the weights on the span by E; the distance from
the left abutment to the wheel near the centre of gravity or point of
application of B by x; and the span by I.
Using the limited number of weights shown in the sketch, where
\V3 represents the weight nearest the resultant E, but indicating such
other terms as would appear, were there more weights between W2 and
Ws or on the right of W4, by the symbol, etc., and taking moments about
the left abutments, we have

A GRAPHICAL METHOD OF COMPUTING BRIDGE
STRESSES FOR CONCENTRATED LOADING-
In specifying the live load for bridges, it is still an almost universal
custom to give an " engine diagram," showing the spacing and loading
of the wheels of one or more locomotives followed by a uniform load
per foot representing the cars. Some specifications go so far as to give
the spacing to the fraction of an inch and loads to the nearest fifty
pounds; others, more sensibly, give even figures; but all expect the
designer to determine the maximum strains that can possibly occur
from any position of the given loading. The bridge engineer, with his
drawer full of moment tables and desk full of specifications—all differ-
ent—is glad to avail himself of graphical methods that obviate figuring
and are not so complicated as to require close mental application to
a void mistakes. This paper will describe the method in use in the office of
the Detroit Bridge &amp; Iron Works. The principles involved are common
to many methods, but it is believed that this method is simpler and
more widely applicable than most of those in use.
Constmction of Diagram (see plate.) Let the loading be the engines
and train as shown on the drawing. Construct a Moment Polygon as
follows:
Lay off the wheel loads from 0 to 18, assume the pole P, and draw
the radiating lines P0, P^ P2, etc. Pu is in this case horizontal, and is
produced to the right; as is also P0. On P13 produced, lay off the
wheel spaces, and draw verticals throught the points of division, wheel
1 being assumed to be at P. Produce 1 P to the first vertical, and from
that point draw the next side of the polygon parallel to 2 P, and so con-
tinue till the vertical over the last wheel is reached. Note that 0 P is one
side of the polygon. Check the work at wheel 18 by measuring the verti-
cal ordinate from the curve to 0 P produced. When multiplied by H, it
should equal the moment about point 18 of all the loads to the left
of that wheel. Any point in the curve may be checked in a correspond-
ing way, for these ordinates are a graphical representation of the
Moment Table described by Mr. George E. Eoehm in The Technic for
1890, page 30. And if any side of the polygon is produced, any vertical


The Technic.
ordinate included between the polygon and this side will represent the
moment of that part of the loading between the ordinate and the side
that is produced. In constructing the portion of our polygon that cor-
responds to the uniform train road, we make use of this fact in the fol-
lowing manner: From x, the last point of the polygon found above,
draw xy parallel to 18 P. Lay off equal spaces of ten feet from the point
where the uniform loading begins and draw verticals through the points
of division. Lay off downwards from xy, on each ordinate, a distance
equal to the total moment of the uniform load to the left of the ordi-
nate in question divided by H; and through these points continue the
curve of the polygon. The curve is a parabola, as it will be found that
the ordinates increase as the numbers 1, 4, 9, 16, etc. And it is well
known that the equilibrium polygon for uniform loading is a parabola.
One setting of the slide rule will give all these ordinates. Finally, write
the weights, spaces, and their summations, above the polygon as shown.
The scales noted on the drawing have been found to be the most conve-
nient for ordinary cases of truss spans and long plate girders. If there
are many short spans to be solved, it is convenient to have a polygon on
a larger scale.
Application.—Assume, fig. 2, a single track, through, single intersec-
tion Pratt truss with inclined end posts; having a total span of 120 ft. = 6
panels of 20 ft. each. Floor system to consist of stringers supported by
floor-beams that connect to the trusses at panel points only. On one
edge of a straight strip of paper, fig. 3, lay off the panel lengths to the
same scale used for laying off the wheel spaces on line 13 P. Mark the
ends of the span and the panel points as shown.
Maximum Chord Stresses.—The position of a load, such as we have
assumed, to produce the maximum bending moment at any point, must
be such that (a) a load is at the point in question; (6) the heaviest loads
are near the point, and (c) the average loads per foot on each side are
about equal. To find, then, the chord stress at the center of the span,
proceed as follows: Place the strip of paper on line P13 so that the
center panel point, Pit coincides with the position of some wheel (con-
dition (a)). To conform to condition (6) try wheel 12. Xote the amounts
of load on the bridge on each side of this wheel and see if they satisfy
condition (c). In the present example we have loads of 107.5 on the
left, and 105.0 on the right. Place P4 at wheel 11. The loads are 107.5
and 110.0, respectively. Placing P4 at wheel 10 we get 107.5 and 115.
It appears that the second position most nearly satisfies condition (c),


but the third position gives- the greatest total load on the span. We will
try both positions. First place the strip with P4 at wheel 11, and from
the ends of the span draw ordinates to the polygon, intersecting it at u
and v. Draw the closing line uv. Then the length of the vertical ordi-
nate over wheel 11, from the polygon to the line uv, will represent the
bending moment at the center of the span for this position of the load-
ing. It is equal in this case to 3,460,000 ft. lbs. Similarly we find the
center bending moment, when wheel 10 is at P4, to be 3,410,000 ft. lbs.
The bending moment from the uniform car loading, supposing it to
—s
1750 X 120
cover the whole truss, is 5 = 3,150,000 ft. lbs.
o
Therefore the maximum bending moment occurs when wheel 11 is at
the center. To find the maximum bending moment at P„ place P3 at
a wheel and experiment as above, till the maximum ordinate is found.
Do the same at P2. Dividing the moments by the depth of the truss, we
obtain the chord stresses desired.
Maximum Shears.—To find the shear in the end panel, place P2 at
wheel 3 for the first trial. From the ends of the span draw ordinates to
the polygon, intersecting it at s and t. Draw st and through P draw
Pm parallel to st; om represents the total reaction at the left abut-
ment. Draw rs, and through P draw Pn parallel to rs. on represents
the portion of this reaction that is carried directly to the abutment by
the stringer, and mn is the shear required. Try the same with wheel 2
at P,. And so on till the maximum is found. If wheel 1 passes off the
span to the left, use line PI in place of Po.
To find the maximum shear in the second panel, place Ps at wheel
3 or 4, etc., and find the maximum reaction as before. The subtractive
shear when wheel 3 is at P3 is On as before, the panels being of equal
length. As the span is moved to the left it will be found that wheel 3,
and then wheel 2, must be at the point where the shear is sought. These
shears give at once the post stresses; and when multiplied by the ratio
of the length of the diagonals to the height of the truss, give the stresses
in the diagonals.
The dead load of a bridge is usually assumed to be uniform over
the whole span, and the stresses from dead load are obtained separately
by ordinary methods.
Plate Girders.—In obtaining the lengths of flange plates of plate
girders, it is usually assumed that the bending moments at different


The Technic.
points vary as the ordinates of a parabola. Having found the point at
which a flange plate should end, according to this supposition, we can
readily find from our diagram the actual bending moment at this point
and see if we have sufficient section.
The maximum shear in a long plate girder will frequently occur
with wheel 14 at the abutment. In this case we place one end of our
span under wheel 14, the other end being towards the left; and draw
onr closing line and a line parallel to it through P. Then we measure
the shear from point 14 to the point of intersection of this line and the
load line.
For short spans, such as stringers, the stresses are usually found
without the aid of the diagram. The maximum bending moment will
usually not occur at the center of the span, but is found as follows:
Place the wheels so that the center of the span will bisect the space
between the center of gravity of the loads and the nearest wheel. The
maximum bending moment will be at this nearest wheel, and will equal
the product of the total load, times the square of the distance of this
wheel from the nearest abutment, divided by the span, less the moments
of any wheels that may be between the abutment and wheel nearest the
center of the span.
The maximum load on a member supporting two discontinuous
spans of equal or unequal length, e. g. a floor beam or trestle bent, is
found from the diagram as follows: Lay off both spans on a strip of
paper and place the dividing point under a wheel. Draw closing lines
for each span and parallel lines through P. The portion of the load-
line intercepted by these parallel lines is the reaction sought.
No attempt has been made in this paper to give proof of all the
statements made, nor to do more than show the application of the dia-
gram in a few very simple cases. It will repay any one, who is inter-
ested in this subject, to construct a diagram and work out the proofs for
himself; and to experiment with trusses of uneven panel length,
inclined chords, etc. Many points will thus be brought out svhich the
limits of this paper have prevented the writer from touching upon.

CONTINUOUS REVOLVING DRAW-BRIDGES.
The object of this article is to explain the writers' method of obtain-
ing the strain, on continuous girders, and more especially its application
to continuous revolving draw-bridges. For the mathematical demon-
stration of the diagrams that will be given see the journal of the Frank-
lin Institute for December, 1888; November, 1889; January and March
1891.
The latter two articles refer more particularly to variable moment
of inertia, but nothing will be attempted in reference to this phase
of the problem here for want of space, especially as the latter
only effects the determination of the fixed points and the quantities
which reduce to A„ and B„ (explained further on) for constant moment
of inertia. We will begin by a few definitions:
P is a weight on a span, a is its distance from the left support and I
is the length of that span.
i is the distance to the fixed point on the left of the center of the span.
j « « k u right " ""
The particular span is denoted by a subscript to the above. If the
rith span is meant we will have Kn = and
A„=-ZPn(2 K„ - 3 K,? +K,?)
Bn=XP„(Kn-Kn3).
M is the moment at the support denoted by its subscript.
H is an arbitrary force (usually the pole distance of the force poly-
gon).
To determine the fixed points (see Fig. 1).
It will be assumed that ln-i — t,.-i and /„ are known and that it is
required to find i,, and _ j. Afterwards it will be shown how the first
are found. This method is for constant moment of inertia.
Let DS = l„-1 — i.-1 and SR = I„
Let BC = AS —-^jp "AB = SC = ~
S is the nth support.

Dd is any convenient length. Draw verticals through A, B and C
and take db any convenient slope and construct the figure.
Then SI=in SJ = ln-1 — In-i.
The analytical demonstration (not given here) shows that i, = 0
hence we can determine h, thence ^ etc., to the last span. Also if a is
the whole number of spans the demonstration shows that L = h, hence
we can determine L-u thence Js_2 etc., back to the first span. In this
manner all the fixed points are found.

The next in order is to determine the quantities A„ and BH. There
are several very good methods. The following for constant moment of
inertia and concentrated load was published in the journal of the
Franklin Institute for November 1889. See Fig. 2.
OL=HK = PI-the span = L
OP = AB — LI — the load taken to a tolerably large scale. GC and
~T&gt;J are parallel to OL.~OA - a„ then AM = A„. KB = B„.
In Fig. 3 is shown the graphical determination of the moment* at
the supports, supposing that this span is the only one that is loaded
and the supports are on a level.

In the figure Ec = Ce — H taken to the same scale that the load
was taken in Fig. 2; Cc is the span EG = B„ and eg — A„ taken directly
from Fig. 2, CA=i„ and Ca = I„. Draw Cg and Gc and drop verticals
from C, A, a and c and draw Mm through the intersections B and b, then

That is, these are the moment ordinates for the left and right sup-
ports respectively.
I will now show how the preceding method is applied to the calcu-
lation of continuous re-
volving draw-bridges. In ^
the following figures the
fixed points and lengths

chosen so as to make a
clear and distinct draw-
ing. For the same rea-
son the length of the

girders is taken much
longer than it would be
in practice.
Suppose the girders

therefore to be consid-
ered as on four supports.

portion is not supposed

For the sake of simplicity a single weight has been assumed, but the
method is similar in principle for a number of weights. In fact, after
one becomes familiar with the cases of loading causing maximum
strains, it is easier and quicker to proceed with all the weights required
on the span at once. The method to employ is (the well known expedi-
ent) to construct the equilibrium polygon for all the loads and to sup-
pose the span to move instead of the loads.
The triangle BSD is the equilibrium polygon for the single load and
the vertical ordinates of the shaded area are equal to the bending
moment divided by the pole distance H. Let the triangle BPO be the
Figure 3.
force polygon for this load. Through 0 draw OL parallel to BJ then
BL = reaction at B. Draw OQ parallel to JF and ON parallel to BD
then LQ-\- NP = reaction at D. Draw Oil parallel to FG then MQ =
negative reaction at E. If ON is parallel to EO then MN = reaction at
G. The reaction at E is the only one that is negative.
It is evident that there must be sufficient dead weight reaction at E
to hold the girder to the support. If not some other hypothesis must
be adopted, such as the theory of partial continuity explained by Prof.
Burr. This theory assumes that the girder is continuous only for loads
on both arms which are identically the same in amount and are sym-
metrically arranged with reference to the center of the girder. The
method pursued by the writer is as follows: Find the maximum strains
on the loaded*arm for all the pieces as if the girder were perfectly con-
tinous, the other arm being unloaded. Also the strains on that arm
unloaded for a full load on the other arm for perfect continuity as
before. Then the correcting strain is to this last strain as the value of


51
Bl for the required load is to its value for full load. These are to be
algebraically added to the maximum first found and are usually oppo-
site in kind, and in practice are quite small for the usual dimension.
The corrected reactions give the correct strains on the central vertical
posts and this method does not apply to them.
If this hypothesis is not to be adopted we mast compute the gir-
der as two unequal spans since it has risen from the third support. In
addition to this we need the moment due to the deflection of the ends
which were just touching the abutments when unloaded. The method
of finding this moment will now be explained.
In Fig. 5 let BD be the left arm of the girder or short span and DG

fixed point for the short span as if it
were fixed at one end and supported
at the other. For constant moment
of inertia it is located at Fand DF =
i BD. Let AR be the value of B1 for
the dead load. Construct the moment

Through F draw PT intersecting the vertical through B at T then
BT = -rm, for constant moment of inertia where 8 is six times the
moment of inertia multiplied by the modulus of elasticity. lx is the
length of the end arm and h is the deflection below a tangent to the
elastic line at the nearest middle support when unloaded. The actual
total deflection is a little greater than this as shown below.
Previous to this the fixed points, C and /, as for two unequal spans
we will suppose have been determined. Multiply the ordinate B f by

Then DV = ~jn\ where /(' is the corrected deflection and I, is the
length of the long span.
Take UG= DV, through / draw UM and through C draw TO; then
OM multiplied by" pole distance is the moment due to the deflection
of the extreme ends. To this is to be added the moment due to both
live and dead loads as for supports on a level which of course are dif-
ferent from those obtained for a three span girder. The method has
already been sufficiently explained.
In conclusion let me say that while there are numerous objections
to the common theory of continuous girders as applied to skeleton trus-
ses yet the fact remains that if such structures are to be built the
theory furnishes the only practicable method of obtaining the strains.
Hence to deduce its results readily and speedily is an object worth
attaining provided it be accompanied with small chance of error. It is
believed that the foregoing satisfies the condition better than anything
ever yet produced.

CALORIMETRIC METHOD OF TESTING STEAM
ENGINES.
In connection with the study of the steam engine, the writer has
found that the calorimetric method of engine testing, usually denomi-
nated Hirn's Analysis, to be of much value and adding greatly to the
interest of the study. In the present article no attempt is made to pre-
sent anything distinctly new, and it may perhaps be considered in some
respects a commentary on thermodynamical treatises, since it has been
attempted to call attention to points often disregarded by the student,
rather than to present new things. The method of studying the steam
engine, by actually measuring the heat-transfers which take place, is, in
the opinion of the writer, likely to add much valuable information to
our knowledge of the steam engine, and is worthy of the closest atten.
tion of the engineer.
The transformation of heat into work forms the basis of all studies
of the theory of the steam engine, and it is interesting to note the origin
and progress of this study. This transformation is but an illustration
of the universal law of conservation of energy, which alone, or in its
general form would furnish us an inadequate basis for reasoning on the
work of a heat-engine. The general law might, however, enable us to
calculate how much work is equivalent to an assigned amount of heat,
and vice versa, provided the transformation could be effected; but it tells
us nothing regarding the percentage of heat that can be transformed,
or under what conditions the transformation is possible. The statement
of the law of transformation of heat energy to work, in such a form
that it could be practically applied was first made by N. L. Sadi Carnot,
in 1824, in a work entitled Reflexions sur la Puissance Motrice du Feu. A
translation of this work, to which is added a life of Carnot, by Dr. R. H.
Thurston, is now published by Wiley &amp; Son, New York. The work shows
a clear conception of the nature of heat, and describes methods of find-
ing the mechanical equivalent, which were not tested experimentally for
a quarter of a century. The principal novelty of the work was the intro-
duction of the idea of a cycle of operations, which should possess the
especial property of being reversible. This apparently unimportant dis-


The Technic.
covery is one on which thermodynamics, as a practical science, wholly
depends, and without which, no application of value could have been
made to explain the action of a heat-engine.
The work of Carnot received very little attention. In 1834 Clapey-
ron stated some of its main features and explained how it could be
applied to an indicator diagram. In 1849 Sir W. Thomson called atten-
tion to the scientific value of the processes in a series of papers.
Thomson's papers on the work of Carnot, following soon after the
experimental work of Joule, which determined the mechanical equiva-
lent of heat, showed the possibility of the dynamical theory of heat.and
secured the attention of Clausius and Rankine, who independently pro-
duced works which established the science of thermodynamics on a firm
basis. Three especially important additions to pure science followed
almost directly from Carnot's methods. (1) The definition of tempera-
ture; (2) the thermodynamic function or entropy; (3) the dissipation of
energy. It can hardly be regarded as within the scope of this paper to
discuss any of the above terms, yet, as the method to be explained, to
some extent, depends on a clear conception of theromodynamic terms
and processes,the writer has taken the liberty to formally set forth some
of the concepts and ideas of pure thermodynamics, although for a full
study of this subject the student is referred to the works of Rankine,
Clausius, Wood, or Peabody.
The reader should, if possible, first gain a clear conception of tem-
perature and heat, and should clearly note the distinctions between the
two; the term heat being used to denote the quantity or amount of a
certain form of energy which is capable of producing the familiar sen-
sation; temperature refers to the intensity of heat, regardless of its
amount, and is measured by the expansion of some substance, in an
instrument termed a thermometer. The total amount of heat may
remain the same and yet the temperature may be changed, as for
instance, if a heated body be dropped into a vessel filled with water, the
heat of the body will in part be transferred to the water, the tempera-
ture of the body will fall, that of the water will rise, yet the total heat
in both bodies, supposing no other transfer, will remain constant, while
the temperatures of both bodies have changed.
If work is performed, a certain amount of heat may be withdrawn
for this purpose, and in this connection two other terms are used:
(1) Isothermal, in which case the temperature of the fluid doing the work
remains constant; this requires the addition of an amount of heat at


55
least sufficient to balance the loss caused by the transformation into
work. (2) Adiabatic, in which case the total amount of heat is
unchanged except by transformation into work; this requires simply
that there shall be no loss of heat by heat-transfer.
The use of these ideas, viz., the transformation into work, (1) with
constant temperature; (2) with constant heat, requires two terms, tem-
perature and entropy, to express the relative value of each. Temperature
is the scale which expresses the relative value of different isothermal
conditions. Entropy is the scale which expresses the relative value of
different adiabatic conditions. Difference of entropy is more difficult
to conceive than difference of temperature since it is not recognized by
any bodily sensations; but it is evidently just as real a concept. If we
denote the absolute temperature by t, heat by H, entropy by &lt;j&gt;
dH
d* = -dT
which is one of the thermodynamic fundamental equations.
The cycle of Carnot, which is the basis of the modern science of
thermodynamics assumes: 1. That work is done by the fluid when in
two conditions, isothermal and adiabatic. 2. That if an equal amount of
work is done to compress the fluid, thus restoring any heat transformed
into work, the fluid being in two conditions, isothermal and adiabatic, the
heat transformed into work in the first case will be restored and the
fluid will be at its original temperature. This reversible cycle is evidently
characteristic of a perfect heat engine, since if it is possible to restore
all heat transformed into work by application of an equal amount of
energy, there can evidently be no loss of heat except that due to work.
The work done by the fluid, in such a case, would be proportional
to the loss of temperature in passing through the engine, and its effi-
ciency would equal the loss divided by the absolute temperature. That
is if T, is the absolute temperature of the entering fluid, that of the
exhaust fluid. The efficiency of a perfect heat engine is
To show the application of the thermodynamic principle just enun-
ciated to a steam engine, we will consider that the steam valve is open
while the piston is traveling during a portion of its stroke, and that
during this time heat is supplied by the entering steam, thus maintain-
ing in the cylinder constant pressure and temperature; this period is


The Technic.
termed that of admission and corresponds to the isothermal condition.
The steam valve is then closed, permitting the steam in the cylinder
to expand, we will suppose without loss of heat producing the period
of expansion which corresponds to the adiabatic condition. During
exhaust the steam valve is opened and the temperature falls and then
remains constant, or is again isothermal. During compression the work
of the moving piston compresses and thus restores heat to the con-
fined steam, thus producing (supposing no other loss) an adiabatic
condition.
This would indicate, provided there were no heat losses except those
due to work, that the action of a steam engine corresponded exactly to
Carnot's cycle.
The thermodynamic efficiency indicates the limit of perfection which
is impossible to pass by any heat engine, it expresses the limitation
regarding the transformation of heat into work, and is of necessity a
very small quantity, rarely exceeding 0.2. Since no engine can utilize
a higher percentage of the total heat than is expressed by the thermo-
dynamic equation of efficiency, it should evidently be the basis with
which to compare the results obtained with the actual engine.
The results indicated by the thermodynamical theory are very
much in excess of those actually obtained in any given case, and it may
safely be stated that the best engine yet constructed has not had an
efficiency exceeding 40 per cent., reckoned from the thermodynamic
efficiency of a perfect engine as a basis of computation.
The following table, from Cottrell's steam engine, shows the ther-
modynamic efficiency for engines working under the conditions given
to be as follows:

The best results obtained with actual engines working between the
above limits, show 40 to 14 pounds of steam per indicated horse power
per hour.
By comparing these results of ideal and actual engines, we see that
the consumption of steam or fuel is more than double that required for
the perfect engine and often from three to four times this amount. The
practical conclusion to be drawn from this is that the thermodynamic
theory gives results which are so at variance with the truth, as to make
a large correction necessary. Not only is a large correction necessary
but the method of making such a correction rests on obscure and empi-
rical formulae, which frequently give results very much at variance
from the truth. In other words while the science of thermodynamics
may give the exact laws which would govern the transformation of
heat into work in an ideal case, where the work is performed in a non-
conducting cylinder, and with a fluid whose condition can be predicted
or which remains constant, its application to the actual conditions of
the steam engine depend on approximate and obscure assumptions.
The causes for the great variation in the results from those indi-
cated by the thermodynamic laws are now well known, and are due to,,
first, the cooling effect of the metal of the cylinder, which varies in;
temperature through the same ranges as the steam. The metal evi-
dently being at the temperature of the exhaust when the steam enters,
and is heated up to that of the entering steam before work is done, thus:
causing a loss of heat and condensation of steam known as initial cylin-.
der condensation. Second, the effect of the heat changes on the steam,
the loss of heat in the steam has the effect of changing its quality with
respect to moisture, and this again has an influence on the action of the
metallic walls. These changes are so complicated in their nature that
a great amount of study from data now obtainable, must be applied
before the thermodynamic theory can be made to express the condition.
Two methods of making this study have been adopted, first, the
geometrical one, in which the form of the indicator diagram is com-
pared with the ideal case: this method is employed by Rankine and
Cottrell; second, the calorimetric process involving algebraic methods
principally as developed by Hirn and Develshanons-Deny.
While much has been accomplished by the first method, there are,
many obstacles to prevent its ultimate success, among which may be
mentioned the small size of the indicator diagram, the mechanical diffi-
culties of making it perfect, and the fact that the quality of the steam


The Technic.
can not be determined from any measurements made on the diagram
itself. The second method of which it is the object of this paper to
explain, traces the heat transformations from point to point in the
passage of the steam through the cylinder, and determines the losses
not by reference to any formula, nor by comparison of the diagram
with any special form but by actual measurement of the quantities
involved.
This method is usually called Hirn's analysis, and the following
explanation.of the principles and processes involved are taken from a
work by the writer of the present paper.*
Although rational and practical laws will no doubt be deduced by
application of this method, it should be understood, however, that in
the present state of the science the designer will still get his rules from
the pure science of thermodynamics modified by approximate formulae:
for the calorimetric method, while well adapted for engines actually
constructed, is not, from its nature, in absence of numerous experiments,
one that can be used with confidence in predicting results.
hirn's analysis.
The principle on which the method is founded is as follows: The
amount of heat supplied the engine is determined by measuring the
pressure, quality and weight of the steam; that removed from the
engine is obtained by measuring the heat in the condensed steam and
that given to the condensing water. The amount of heat remaining in
the cylinder per pound of steam at any point after cut-off can be calcu-
lated from the data obtained from the indicator-diagram; this multiplied
by the known weight gives the total heat.
The heat supplied to the engine added to that already existing in
the clearance spaces gives the total amount of heat available; if from
this sum there be taken the heat existing at cut-off and the heat equiva-
lent of the work done during admission, the difference will be the loss
during admission, due principally to cylinder-condensation. The dif-
ference between the heat in the cylinder at cut-off and that at release
after deducting the work equivalent is that lost or restored during expan-
sion. This method applied to all the events of the stroke, and at as
many places as required, gives full information of the transfer of heat
to and from the metal.

The value of the quantity at any point under discussion is denoted
by the following subscripts: clearance, c; beginning of admission, 0;

The equations are as follows:
Heat in the Entering Steam.—li the steam is moist,
(1) Q = M(q + xr); ...
if the steam is superheated D degrees,
(2) Q = M(q + r + cpD)...
Heat in the Cylinder.—Since the steam in this case is invariably moist,
we have the following equations:
(3) In the clearance spaces, hc = M0 (qc + xcpc);...
(4) At admission, h0 - Jf,(ft+*oP»); • • •
(5) At cut-off, hl = (M+M(1){q1+xlpl);...
(6) At release, = (M+M0) (q2 + X2P2); ■ ■ ■
(7) At compression, hs = (M-\-M0) (qz + x3p3). ...
The external work is to be determined from the indicator-diagram.
Let the heat equivalent of this work be represented as follows:
(8) During admission, A Wa;...

(10) During exhaust, A Wc;...
(11) During compression, A Wa. ...

in which u equals the excess of volume of one pound of steam over that
of one pound of water; u =v—cr.
Substituting the value of u in the above equation,
(13) V= M(xv + o(l— x)) ...
As a is a very small quantity, (1—x)a can be safely dropped as less
than the errors of observation, and in all practical applications the
formula used is
(14) V = Mxv...
In the exact equation (13). or the approximate equation (14), if the .
pressure, weight and volume of steam are known, its specific volume, c,
can be found, and x may be computed.
At any point in the stroke after the steam-valve is closed, the vol-
ume and pressure of steam in the cylinder can be determined from the
indicator-diagram if the dimensions of the engine and its clearance are
known. If the weight of steam used is known from an engine-test,
there can be determined from the indicator-diagram both the quality
and amount of heat in the cylinder at any point, with the single excep-
tion of the steam remaining in the clearance spaces. Thus let Vc equal
volume of clearance; V0-\-Vc, volume at admission, usually equal to Ve;
V\ + Vc, volume at cut-off; Fj+ V,, at release; Vs + Vc, at compression;
M, the weight of steam used; M0, the weight of steam caught and
retained in the clearance spaces. Then, by method used in equation (12)
(15) Vc = M0(xcuc + ac);...
(16) T o + Vc = M0 (x0 m0 + &lt;r0);...
(17) Vx + Vc = (Ma+M) (x, u, + «,);...
(18) Vt+ Vc = (M0+M)(x2u3 + c2);...
(19) V, + V.= (A/0 + M) (x, u, + o,)...
In the above equations we know the volumes and pressures for each
point, and the weight of steam, M, passing through the engine. So that
in the five equations there are six unknown quantities: M0, xe, xt, xt, xt
and xs, of which x0 may be assumed as 1.00 without sensible error. In
the above equations (15) and (16) are usually identical; they differ from
each other only when there is a sensible lead which shows on the dia-
gram.
The weight of steam in the clearance space is computed from equa-
tion (15):
Ma — (rc)-r-(.rc«c+(Tc) = Vc-i-xcve, nearly.
Assume x = 1.00:
(20) Af,= rc-t-vc...


In computing the heat at any point, it is customary to compute the
sensible and internal heat in two operations. Thus in equation (4) make
h, the total heat, equal to H, the sensible heat plus H', the internal heat;
then
K -H0 + H0' = (x0p0 + q„)'M0;

From equation (17),

The analysis determines the loss of heat during a given period, by
finding the difference between the heat in the cylinder at the beginning
of the period and the sum of that utilized in work during the period
and that remaining at the end of the period.
The following directions and example should make the method
clearly understood.
Directions foe Engine-testing by Hirn's Analysis.
Directions.—1. Make a complete engine-test with a constant load,
weigh the condensing water, and measure its temperature before and
after condensing the steam. Obtain the quality of the entering steam,
either in the steam-pipe or steam-chest if convenient, make calorimet-
ric determinations of the quality of the steam in the exhaust, which
may be used as a check on the results, but which is necessary in case
the exhaust steam is not condensed.
2. Calibrate all the instruments used, and correct all observations
where required.
3. From the average quantities on the log, corrected as shown by
the calibration, fill out form I, of data and results. The steam and
condensing water used per revolution to be divided between the forward
and backward strokes of the piston in proportion to the M. E. P. of these
respective strokes, as shown on the log.

4. Draw on each diagram as explained lines corresponding to zero
volume and to zero pressure, and divide the diagrams as shown in Fig.
1 into sections, by drawing lines to points of admission w, cut-off cn,
releas'e oe, and compression od.
Measure for each diagram the percentages of cut-off, release, and
compression, calling the original length of the diagram, without clear-
ance, 100 per cent.
5. Measure the absolute pressure from each card and enter the
averages in blank form No. II, using subscripts as follows: 0, admission:
1, cut-off; 2, release; 3, compression; c, clearance.
Take from a steam-table the heat of liquid, internal latent heat,
total latent heat, total heat and specific volume, corresponding to each
of the above pressures.
6. Compute the volumes in cubic feet, for clearance, total vol-
umes including clearance, at admission, cut-off, release, and compres-
sion, and place the average results in the proper columns.
7. Compute the area corresponding to each period into which the
diagram is divided and find the mean pressure for that period. Also
rind the work done in each period, expressed in foot-pounds and also in
B. T. U. (It is to be noted that the work done during the return stroke
is negative.) Enter the average of these results in the proper place,
noting the use of the subscripts a, b, c, and d.
8. Calculate the heat-losses as indicated on Form III, which is an
account of the heat used during 100 strokes of the engine. The weight


of steam, M, in pounds is 100 times the amount used for one stroke as
given on Form I. The weight of steam in clearance is to be calculated
for admission, pressure, and volume, and with x equal to 1.00. M, to be
calculated in the same manner. Calculate from known weights and
temperatures the heat exhausted from the engine in the condensed
steam K' and in the condensing water K.
Calculate by the formulae, as explained, the heat supplied the engine,
and the sensible and internal heat, at each event in the stroke of the
engine.
9. Calculate the cylinder-loss at admission as the difference between
that supplied added to that already in the clearance, and that remain-
ing at cut-off added to that used in work. If the heat is flowing from
the metal, the sign will be negative, otherwise positive.
10. Perform the same operation for each period of the engine; the
difference between the heat at the beginning of each period and that at
the end, taking into account the work done, is the loss.
11. Take theulgebraic sum of these losses and of the heat equiva-
lent of the external work, and if no error has been made in the calcula-
tions, this sum, which is the total transformation, will equal the differ-
ence between the heat supplied and that exhausted. That is, using the
symbols of the analysis, D — D'. It is also evident that this quantity is
the loss by radiation.
The importance of this check on the accuracy of the computations
should not be overlooked. If no errors of computation are made, in
each case the value of D will equal that of D'.
12. Make the remaining calculations as on Form IV; these give the
quality which the steam must have at various portions of the stroke to
correspond witn the foregoing calculations. The quality is calculated
from the volume remaining in the cylinder. Compute the various effi-
ciencies.
Note that the heat lost during admission is in some respects a meas-
ure of the initial cylinder-condensation.
The following forms filled in part with the results of an actual test
may form an interesting study and are presented as used in the classes
in my charge.
The percentages of the heat transformed at each portion of the step
is well shown in form IV from which we see that, 42 per cent, of the
heat was absorbed in heating the metal of the cylinder during admis-
sion, which had the effect of reducing the steam which entered nearly

dry to a condition in which 52 % only was dry steam. This heat was
partly restored during expansion, but at such a time as to be available
only for a limited amount of work, and the remainder was rejected in
the exhaust.
The analysis traces these heat interchanges in such a manner that
one can clearly see the magnitude of the corrections which must be
made to the thermodynamical laws to approximate the real condition,
and thus makes the test of the steam engine contribute vastly to our
knowledge regarding the relation of heat and work as exhibited in the
steam engine.

THE GENESIS OF PHOTOGRAPHY WITH HINTS ON
DEVELOPING.
Photography has become such a necessary adjunct of all depart-
ments of science and art, and amateur and professional photographers
so abundant, that the public is apt to look upon photography as some-
thing that has existed for centuries. Were we to compare it with other
science we would find that it is yet in its infancy. The birthday of
practical photography actually dates from 1839. Some writers, how-
ever, antedate its history with a much earlier period, assigning as a
reason, therefor, the fact that as far back as the sixteenth century the
alchemists had observed that silver chloride became changed when
exposed to the action of light. In those days, however, their minds
were occupied with the problem of transmuting the baser metals into
gold, and this change was supposed to be a kind of transmutation. In
1777, Scheele found that when silver chloride was exposed to light,
under water, that a substance capable of forming silver chloride on the
application of silver nitrate was held in solution in the water. He, also
found that when the blackened residue was treated with ammonia, the
silver chloride was disolved leaving a black deposit of metallic silver.
In 1801, Eitter discovered the fact that silver chloride was darkened
most rapidly by those spectrum rays lying beyond the violet, but none
of these experiments were in any way applied to true photography. A
year later, Wedgwood and Sir Humphrey Davey began their experi-
ments and were able to make images of tracings or painting upon glass,
but these were not permanent as they would not withstand the action
of light. In 1814, Joseph Xicephore de Niepce spread bitumen upon
metal, and after many hours exposure in a camera found that that
portion of the resin which had been acted upon by the light, had lost
its pristine solubility in certain oils, but the exposure was of such dura-
tion that while it might be applied to -printing, it could not be applied
to practical photography.
The year 1839, may truly be said to be the birth year of practical
photography. In that year Daguerre, in partnership with a son of the
older Xiepce, produced the Daguerreotype process, which was based


69
upon the fact that a highly polished plate of silver exposed to the
action of vapors of iodine becomes sensitive to light. By this method
they were able to produce a single picture, but prints or duplicates
could not be made from it.
In this same year Fox Talbot published his process for reproducing
any number of prints from tracing or drawing, etc. His method con-
sisted in coating white paper with sodium chloride and then brushing
over the surface a solution of silver nitrate. This with the addition of
albumen is the method used to this day for albumen printing. Thus we
may readily see that the history of practical photography covers a
period of little more than half a century, yet, during that period it has
invaded every avenue of science, literature and art. We can scarcely
pick up a book, or a periodical of the better class that does not largely
depend upon photography for its illustrations.
It is capable of application and adaptation to all classes of objects,
from the most minute bacilli to the largest heavenly bodies. In fact a
small volume might well be written upon the uses of photography, and
the time is not far distant when an education will not be considered
complete without some knowledge of this branch. The most important
branch of photography is the plate and its development. It makes
little difference what the'subject may be—whether it is the germs of
bacteria so minute as to require from rV to oil immersion lenses, or
the heavenly bodies requiring the largest objectives, in either case the
the negative is made visible by the process known as development, and
without a good negative the remainder of the work is of little value.
Therefore, all who attempt photographic work should thoroughly
master the application of the principles of development. Without
accuracy and the ability to manipulate these principles, all hopes of
success must be abandoned.
We should begin with the developer, and as this is a complex
substance we should first learn the function of each constituent. All
developers consist of three essential parts; 1st, the reducer; 2d, the
alkali, and 3d, the preserver. The reducer may be made up of one or
more of the reducing agents now in common use. The oldest is pyro-
galol more commonly called pyrogallic acid. With this good printing
negatives may be obtained which are full of detail, though the nega-
tives are not as pleasing to the eye as those produced by the more
recent reducers. Its most objectionable feature is the unsightly stain
which it leaves upon the hands. Hydrochinon has many warm


The Technic.
admirers, producing lots of contrast and density, but is too slow for
rapid work.
Eikonogen is very energetic, producing an abundance of detail,
but less contrast or density than the preceding. It is admirably adapted
for instantaneous exposures.
Paramidophenol has gained many friends, but its high price pre-
vents it from coming into general use. It is an energetic reducer, at
the same time giving good detail and density. The writer is strongly in
favor of a combination of eikonogen and hydrochinon in the propor-
tion of two of the former to one of the latter. This combines detail
with good density, thus producing an excellent printing negative of a
rich, dark color.
2d. For the alkalies, ammonia, carbonate of potash, caustic and
carbonate of soda, are used, caustic soda and carbonate of potash are
used with hydrochinon, but with eikonogen either of the carbonates
may be used. Caustic soda should not be used as it is too energetic and
softens the film.
3d. The preserver consists of sulphite of soda or a mixture of sul-
phite and bi-sulphite of soda. The dried sulphite may be used when
fresh, but upon long standing it is gradually converted into sulphate of
soda. Therefore, the crystallized salt is preferable.
The formula for Eikonogen and Hydrochinon developer accom-
panying Carbutt's plates is a good one, it is as follows:
A. Distilled Water 20 oz.
Sulphite of Soda Cryst 4 oz. av.
Eikonogen 330 grs.
Hydrochinon 160 grs.
Water to make up to 32 oz.
B. Distilled Water 20 oz.
Carbonate Potash 2 oz.
Carbonate Soda Cryst 2 oz.
Water to make up to 32 oz.
Observation has convinced the writer that the majority of amateurs
do not thoroughly understand developing. The following hints may
serve as a guide for future study.
1st. Make several exposures upon the same plate by drawing the
slide out a short distance between each exposure. Then develop the
plate with one part of A, one-half part of B, and three parts of water.


71
Having by a few of these experiments found the correct time for
a full exposure; expose a plate about one-half that time, cover the
plate with a mixture of one part of B to three parts of water, allow the
plate to remain in this solution for five minutes, return the mixture to
the graduate, and add one part of A, and proceed to develop the plate.
A few such experiments will enable one to handle instantaneous or
under exposures successfully. Now make a few over exposures and
proceed as follows:
Cover the plate with three ounces of water containing five or ten
drops of a 10 per cent, solution of potassium bromide. Allow the
plate to remain for a few minutes in this solution. Reject the solution
and proceed to develop with the following: one part of A, one-half
part of B, four ounces of water and add two to four drops of the 10 per
cent, bromide solution to each ounce of the mixed developer.
The bromide acts as a restrainer, and the amount may be varied
according to the length of the exposure. Having now mastered over
exposures, suppose that we have a plate, the exposure-time Qf which is
unknown. Cover the plate with a mixture of one part of A, and three
parts of water, and add, at intervals, small quantities of B, observing
closely. Should the plate show signs of over exposure remove the
developer and place in water with a few drops of bromide solution, and
proceed as in developing an over exposed plate. If on the other hand
the image fails to appear within a reasonable time, treat as for an under

Such experiments may seem an expensive tuition to the Amateur,
but it is time and money well spent, and in the end will prove a far
better economy than the many random shots that will occur unless the
principles underlying the cause and the remedy of the failure be under-

THE STUDY OF GEOLOGY IN AN ENGINEERING
COURSE.
The study of Geology, in the broadest acceptation of the term, is
nothing less than the study of the past history, the present condition,
and the probable future of the earth on which man lives. Its accepted
theories rest upon a multitude of individual observations. It encroaches
upon, if it does not cover, the domain of several sister sciences, giving
aid to, or receiving aid from, them all in turn. There is scarcely any
branch of human knowledge or activity, with the possible exception of
some of the so-called humanities, to which it does not make a direct
contribution.
The student preparing to enter any branch of engineering as a
profession cannot afford to remain in ignorance of the relation geology
has to the affairs of actual life, though he may properly be excused
from trying to follow the geologist in all his search for truth. For
geology frequently has to deal with problems of stupendous difficulty.
Some of these problems involve forces of unknown intensity acting
through periods of time, whose unit of measure cannot be expressed,
even approximately, in years or centuries. The earth has a history as
an individual unit in a countless aggregate of bodies that are constantly
moving in a space whose limit the most far-searching telescope can get
no hint of; and it has, besides, a story to tell of internal development
and unceasing molecular change, whose laws the microscopes of highest
power have not yet been ably fully to reveal. The rocky crust of the
earth has been shaken and broken by powerful agencies of contraction
and upheaval, and vast districts have been covered with silt and
detrital material that must have required long ages of relative quiet
for their deposition. The continental areas and the oceanic depressions,
which to-day are peopled with myriads of living beings, were once deso-
late and barren of organic life; and wide-spread accumulations of fossil
remains supply abundant evidence to establish the truth of the law of
evolutionary progress, under which has been developed the long series
of plants and animals from the earliest palaeozoic types to the fauna-
and flora of the present day.

The ideal geologist must be possessed of great and varied learning.
He must be acquainted with the grand and comprehensive generaliza-
tions established by the patient labor of the astronomer; he must be-
well versed in the deductions of the mathematician; he must be familiar
with the experimental work of the chemist and the physicist, and he
must be at home in the laboratory of the biologist. Few men have the
time or the ability to master more than a small part of the general sub-
ject; and each specialist, however strong in his chosen territory, must
call for assistance upon his co-workers in adjacent districts. Mutual
help promotes the progress of all.
It is sometimes held up as a reproach against the science of geology
that its disciples and expounders are apt to range themselves in hostile
camps; and that the leaders in the science are not in all respects at one
among themselves. But it must be remembered that geology is not
yet numbered among the exact sciences. Geological theories are
necessarily incomplete and tentative, and, therefore, must be held at all
times subject to revision, whenever errors in earlier views are detected
or new truths are brought to light. It is easy to err in interpreting
observed phenomena, especially when the truth can only be learned
by the careful study of many details and the help of numerous auxil-
iary sciences.
It cannot be denied that many of the geological doctrines, prevail-
ing at any one period of time, the present day not excepted, are, at the
best, but approximations to the truth, which are destined to give place
to others at some future day. But the rate of change from year to year
is^small, and will doubtless grow smaller as the years go by. Little by
little man is unravelling the mystery and coming to a better under-
standing of the laws of nature. The amount of agreement and the
consensus of opinion on important cardinal points are constantly on
the increase among leading geologists; among the men, that is, who
have given the best part of their lives and their best energies to the
study of geology, and are thus best qualified to weigh the evidence for
and against the substantial accuracy of any geological theory. Yet no
one will be more ready than they to admit that the final word has not
yet been spoken, that there is {still room for emendation and improve-
ment. They ask no one to put implicit confidence in all the theories
advocated, nor to be absolutely unquestioning in his beliefs. But this
fact should not deter the layman and the non-geological student from
giving proper recognition to geological authority, nor from accepting


The Technic.
as sufficiently accurate for practical purposes the hypotheses that rest
upon this authority. Infallibility is beyond reach. He who waits to see
all doubt removed before acting, will attain to only a low grade of ac-
complishment. A high degree of probability that a given course will
lead to success is an efficient and often a decisive stimulus to exertion.
There is a large body of undisputed geological truth with which it
is for the interest of every student of engineering to make himself
familiar. He will not be apt, it is true, in the practice of his profession,
to get involved in the discussion of nice palseontological distinctions,
nor of the comparative merits of conflicting views as to the origin of
mountains or the cause and duration of the glacial period; but he is
likely to become deeply concerned with what geology has to tell him
about the structure of the earth's outer crust, and about the value and
uses of the rocks and minerals found therein. It is a mistake to think
that this subject can be passed lightly by.
Students are sometimes tempted to speak in depreciatory terms of
any subject of study whose practical bearing upon their plan of life is
not at once .obvious, and to think the time wasted that is spent upon it.
They frequently say, and it may be conceded that they are sometimes
justified in saying, that the matters treated are too far to one side
of their main track to have much attraction for them; that, if the
emergency ever arises where the need is felt of a knowledge of the
neglected subject, it will be possible, and even profitable, to obtain the
services of a recognized expert in that subject and let him settle the
mooted points. With an increasing specialization of professions, and
with an ever spreading diversity of labor there comes a feeling that the
necessity is constantly growing less and less for any one person to sup-
plement his own specific attainments by making excursions into the
domain of another; but it is still the part of wisdom for one to make
himself acquainted with the border strip and the transition district
where he holds a community of interest with others. It is expected
of the physician that he will know the therapeutic properties of the
remedies in the market, and their effects on each other, though he
need not have experience in the actual testing of the purity of all kinds
of drugs, nor possess the pharmacist's manipulatory skill in the com-
pounding of prescriptions. The mining engineer will save himself
much vexation and worry, to say nothing of dollars and cents, if he is
enough of a lawyer to understand the legal principles under which
mining rights are gained and maintained.


75
In some peculiar hypothetical community where all the conditions
and relations of life were accurately adjusted to secure the maximum
of useful effect for every expenditure of energy, it is conceivable that
some enthusiast might advocate a policy of determining at birth the
precise position in the social machine that each person should occupy,
and of training him from infancy to perform the function pertaining to
that position, and to that position only. Under these conditions every
man would be a specialist of the strictest kind, and the " Scarabeeist,"
with whom Dr. Holmes, in his Poet at the Breakfast Table, makes his
readers acquainted, might be a typical student of science, and a typical
member of society. The Scarabee, it will be remembered, while admit-
ting that some of his friends, from an excess of courtesy, were in the
habit of calling him a coleopterist, though he himself laid no claim to
so high a title, refused point blank the name of entomologist, for
entomology, he said, is a study far too extensive for any one human
being to master. But the educated professional engineer of today must
be something more than a scarabeeist among his fellows. It is seldom
the case that a man can so control affairs as to limit his sphere of
activity or of study to any very small portion of his general subject.
A real point of difficulty lies in the fact that no one can tell in
advance just how far he can pursue his collateral studies, nor just how
much he can omit, without detriment to his specialty. The circum-
stances and conditions of professional life will be apt to bring some
topics into unexpected prominence and push others into the back-
ground. No student can hope to make an equal use of all the infor-
mation and training he gets in a university course; and no two students
are likely to make quite the same use of any part of their common
undergraduate work. A favored few, indeed, who have their future
career pretty plainly marked out for them, or who are fitting them-
selves to fill positions already waiting for them in some established
business, may be granted privileges of choice and of specialization in
which it would be imprudent for others to indulge. It must not be
assumed too hastily, however, that the few thus provided for are always
the ones most to be envied. A young man who feels so sure of the
branch of industry his life-work is to be in as to think himself justified
in neglecting anything and everything whose bearing upon his future
he. cannot see, is often in an unfortunate position, and he may have to
learn by bitter experience what a less exacting teacher could give him
more easily.


The Technic.
Herr Wappler, who for many years had charge of the sales of min-
erals at the Freiberg Mining Academy, and for whom there is a warm
spot in the memory of many an American student that had dealings
with him twenty or thirty years ago, used to relate experiences of his
that may serve here by way of illustration. Persons would come to him
early in their course of study, saying, that, as they expected to take
charge of silver mines in the Rocky Mountains, they wanted to pur-
chase small collections of minerals that would show all the known
varieties of silver ores, and that they wished for nothing else. A few
weeks later the same persons would want their collections enlarged
by specimens of minerals likely to occur as gangue, and not con-
taining any silver. Still later the call would be for the earthy mirferals
found in the rocks that enclose the silver veins, and so on until col-
lections were at last gathered, little by little, identical with the ones
Herr Wappler had recommended at the outset and would have fur-
nished for less money.
The differentiation of the engineering courses at the University of
Michigan, and the distinctions made between the requirements for the
bachelor's degree in civil, mechanical, mining, and electrical engineer-
ing, make it impracticable to arrange a scheme of geological require-
ments to be prescribed for all classes of engineering students; and the
case would be still more complicated, if special courses in dynamical,
hydraulic, sanitary, and marine engineering were added. A course of
study that would be a minimum for a mining student would require
more time than can properly be asked, under present conditions, of the
mechanical or the electrical engineer, when account is taken of the
relative importance of the different portions of his work.
The late Professor Alexander Winchell in a paper published a short
time before his death and entitled, Shall we teach Geology? presented
and advocated with much force the claims of the science, in which he
stood a recognized leader, to a rank among the culture-studies, and
urged many cogent reasons why it should be assigned a place in all sys-
tematic curricula required of candidates for academic degrees. But a
student who has once fairly embarked on an engineering course feels
that he has but little leisure for culture-studies, pure and simple. If
he wishes to add in any direction to the strictly technical details of his
work and to pursue some collateral subject in the hours he has to
spare, he is naturally attracted by one that combines the useful with
the agreeable, and that has a practical as well as a culture value.
i


Among studies of this double character geology easily stands in the
front rank.
In a course of geological study planned especially for the benefit
of students of engineering, the broad principles and the most general
deductions of the science would be sketched in outline and illustrated
by a sufficient number of striking examples, without any attempt at
formal demonstration of their truth. The omission of the demonstra-
tion would work no harm. The principal reasons for believing that
the material of which the earth is composed was once in a highly
heated, molten, or even gaseous condition, can be stated by a skillful
lecturer in a few words; and can be readily comprehended by the
average student. But whether the nebular hypothesis or the meteoric
hypothesis has the stronger arguments in its favor, and whether or
not the process of cooling has gone so far as to make the present
earth practically solid to its center, are questions that have taxed
the powers of the most highly trained physicists and mathematicians
of the world, and are still open to further study. They are ques-
tions, moreover, in which the engineering student feels little concern.
The accessible portions of the earth's outer crust, the portions with
which the engineer comes in contact, and which he wishes to make
use of, show, to be sure, some differences in thermal condition, but
the range of temperature is not great and the variations from place to
place are gradual.
There are no reasons for thinking that any rapid changes of crustal
temperature are to be anticipated in the near future, at least not in
regions distant from the centers of active volcanic disturbance. So far
as concerns the affairs of the present generation of men, the earth is
practically constant in temperature, and this view of the case suffices for
the engineer and the practical man of affairs, who does not trouble
himself with the evidences of secular change, that are full of interest
to speculative geologists. •
The present condition of the earth's surface; of its rocks and their
contents, and the geological phenomena that affect their value in sup-
plying the wants of man, are the things the engineers want to know
about, some to a greater, some to a less, degree. The mining engineer
will push his researches farther than the civil engineer, and the latter
in turn will be likely to outstrip the mechanical engineer, but he who
makes any advance at all will be sure of an ample reward for his time
and labor.


The Technic.
Everything that helps in the acquisition and the fixing in mind of
this desirable knowledge will be of direct and positive service to the
student. Theories of formation, of structure, of change, of develop-
ment must be studied, for it is by their aid that the true relations of
facts come to be better understood. The laws that govern the orderly
succession of stratified rocks must be investigated, for this order is a
fact of fundamental significance, and upon a proper interpretation of
the facts in any given case will frequently turn the question of success
or failure in a commercial enterprise. It would be folly for any one
not endowed with an unlimited capacity for memorizing details to try
to grasp the full significance of a mass of isolated facts in geology
without the assistance furnished by geological theory. The two things
go side by side. Theory requires a sure foundation of facts to rest
upon; facts require systematization and marshalling in order for use
under the guidance of theory. Illustrations of this general principle
might be cited in large number, and the peculiar value to the engineer
of specific portions of geology's broad domain, might be enlarged upon
at length, but it is unnecessary. The purpose of the present article is
accomplished if it has suggested the direction in which the study of
geology may be followed to the best advantage in an engineering
course, and has indicated, in a general way, the spirit by which both
teacher and student should be governed.

TEST WITH CARHART-CLARK CELL.
The original Latimer Clark cell, as used as a standard of electromo-
tive force, possessed certain abnormal and irregular values, both of
electromotive force and temperature coefficient. These irregularities
led Lord Eayleigh to undertake a thorough investigation of the cell.
In order to overcome these irregularities Lord Eayleigh made certain
modifications in the Clark cell, resulting in what is now known as the
Lord Eayleigh form of the Clark cell.
In his modified form Lord Eayleigh used a small glass tube with a
platinum wire sealed through the closed end. Upon this a sufficient
quantity of pure mercury, distilled in vacuo, is poured to cover the plat-
inum effectively. The mercury in turn is covered with a paste prepared
by mixing together in a mortar 150 grams of mercurous sulphate, 5
grams zinc carbonate, to neutralize acid and as much saturated zinc
sulphate solution as is required to make a thick paste. After the car-
bonic acid gas has escaped the paste is poured into the tube through a
small funnel, care being taken not to soil the sides of the tube.
On this paste is poured some of the saturated solution of zinc sul-
phate and a few zinc sulphate crystals are added to insure saturation.
A cleaned zinc rod with a copper wire soldered to its upper end is then
passed down into the paste and is held in position by a piece of cork
which is forced down nearly to the paste. The cell is then sealed by
pouring in enough hot marine glue to cover the cork and projecting
portion of the zinc leaving only the copper wire projecting.
The objections to Lord Eayleigh's modified form of the Clark ele-
ment are: the temperature co-efficient is high and apparently variable;
it is not constructed in such a manner as to keep the zinc and metallic
mercury out of contact; and the contact of zinc and mercurial salt per-
mits of local action whereby zinc displaces mercury.
The temperature coefficient is made up of two parts: one a real
temperature effect, the other a secondary change, due to the variability
in the density of the zinc sulphate solution. A rise of temperature
lowers the electromotive force by increasing the density of the solution
in addition to the direct effect of the temperature change.


The Technic.
These objections have been overcome by Professor H. 8. Carhart in
his modified form of the cell known as the Carhart-Clark standard
cell.
Professor Carhart's modifications are as follows: the zinc sulphate
solution used is saturated at the temperature of melting ice, thus
doing away with the abnormal changes in the temperature coeffi-
cient due to change in the density of the solution; and the zinc is
kept out of contact with the mercury by interposing a cork between
the zinc sulphate and the mercurous sulphate, and thus preventing
local action.
lo.ooe* OhlUS
In this paper it is desired to show the change in electromotive force
corresponding to a change in the density of the zinc sulphate solution:
also the extent to which the temperature coefficient will be affected by
changing the density of the zinc sulphate solution.
In this investigation the Carhart-Clark form of cell was used.
Two cells of each density of zinc sulphate solution were made and
the electromotive force and temperature co-efficient of each were accur-
ately determined.
The Lord Rayleigh method of measuring electromotive force was
employed as shown in the accompanying sketch in which P&gt; represent*
the cell -whose electromotive force is to be determined and B' is a Le-
Clanche cell. G is a Thomson long coil galvanometer.
The sum of the resistances in the two boxes was kept constant at
10,000 ohms.

The electromotive force of the standard cell used for comparison
was 1,435 volts at 15° C. It was kept very near 15° C. and reductions
made to that temperature by the co-efficient 0.00039.

EXPERIMENTS WITH FOUNDRY IRON AND ALUMINUM.
The subject of aluminum and its alloys with other metals has of
late, and is to-day attracting considerable attention.
The popular idea seems to be that, soon we are to have carriages,
cars, bridges, etc., made of aluminum or its alloys. This is erroneous.
Scientific men and men well versed in the arts do not entertain such
wild ideas. There would be no object in making a bridge of aluminum
provided we could get it as cheap as iron and could work it as readily.
Aluminum being about one-third as strong as steel and about one-third
as heavy, the structure would have the same weight with three times
the bulk.
Pure aluminnm is too soft and difficult to work to be of much use.
It is used with considerable success in some medical and scientific instru-
ments. It is affected by gases and fumes, a very little.
Aluminum seems to be peculiarly fitted for cooking utensils and
here a great market for it may be developed, from present indications.
Another use for aluminum and the one which interests us most in
this paper, is the alloying with other metals. Some of these alloys are
very valuable while others are not. The copper aluminum alloys are
among the valuable ones. These have been well tested by Prof. Thurs-
ton of Cornell University and Mr. Keen of the University of Illinois.
These alloys have the advantage of being strong but the disadvantage of
being expensive when compared with mild steel.
Aluminum in cast-iron is another alloy which has been much con-
sidered, and some extravagant statements have been made in its favor.
Mr. Keep, superintendent of the Michigan Stove Company of Detroit,
has done some elaborate work in this line, and has come to the conclu-
sion that it is of but little benefit to use aluminum in cast iron. He is
convinced, however, that the hard irons will stand more aluminum
than the soft irons, and that aluminum possesses the power to a great
extent to change combined carbon into graphite.
The writer experimented with commercial aluminum and ordinary
foundry iron, to ascertain what effect aluminum added to cast-iron in •
commercial way would have on the castings.
Making the Test Bars.—The bars were eighteen inches long by onu


inch square enlarged at the ends to fit the testing machine. The bars
were moulded in green sand and cast the same as commercial iron,
except that they were poured on end to insure sound castings.
The test bars in tiie table below, which show high results, were
made from Scioto No. 1 pig and scrap iron, half and half. The bars
that show low results were made from an Ohio iron. The scrap was
selected with care and run about the same all through. The test bars
were made at the middle of heats, ranging from twelve to fifteen hun-
dred pounds each. The furnace used was an eighteen inch plain cupola,
in the foundry at the Engineering Laboratory of the University of
Michigan.
All of the odd numbers in the table represent iron, while the even
numbers represent iron with aluminum. Every odd and every even
number represents an average of three pieces. The links in the table
show that both numbers are from the same ladle of iron.
When test bars were made the furnace was tapped and some of the
iron was taken out and cast into the odd numbers. The rest of the iron
was run into a ladle, which had been weighed with a known amount of
aluminum at the bottom, to allow the iron to pour over it, thus mixing
better than by placing the aluminum in the ladle and stirring it in
from the top. When the iron had filled the ladle, it was weighed and
the ladle deducted. The test bars thus made were allowed to cool
slowly in order to be soft.
The pieces which were high in aluminum looked more like lead
than iron on the outside, the sand peeled off much smoother than from
the castings where aluminum was not used.
One thing was very marked about the iron before it was poured.
The ladles which had less than one-half of one per cent, of aluminum
were very fluid; while those with over one per cent, were not very
fluid. The iron with a small amount of aluminum boiled very freely
and cast into fine, sharp work. One can see by the table that for small
fine castings, a small per cent, of aluminum is of some benefit; (1) It
makes the iron more fluid; (2) it makes the castings smoother and
sharper; (3) it makes the castings a little stronger.
Cleaning and Measuring.—The pieces were cleaned but the scale was
not removed. The specimens were marked every eight inches and the
cross section at the marks measured. The elongation was noted, but
amounted to but little. The reduction of areas at the break was prac-
tically nothing.


The Technic.
Testing.—The testing was done on an Olsen, one hundred thousand
pound testing machine, at the Engineering Laboratory, University of
Michigan.
The elastic limit and the ultimate strength were practically the
same.

On examining the table it can readily be seen that if aluminum is
to be used at all, it must be in small quantities, as it is more apt to do
harm than good. The writer made some experiments on hard iron but
the castings were too poor to make use of and time would not permit of
more work in this line.
The writer has drawn the following conclusions from his own
experiments and those of others.
The condition of cast iron depends largely on the nature of its car-
bon. If the iron has too much combined carbon, it is apt to be hard


and brittle, if it has too much graphite it is apt to be weak. There is a
certain medium point at which we get the greatest strength, therefore,
aluminum would be beneficial only where the carbon needed freeing.
On the other hand aluminum is detrimental where too much free car-
bon exists.
We may safely say, that aluminum should not be placed in the
hands of an ordinary foundry man; but if used at all it must be used in
a scientific manner.
Aluminum if added at all, to cast iron, should be done during the
manufacture of the pig iron at the blast furnace.
It is generally the opinion that aluminum helps to make sound
castings. I found this to be so when small quantities were used.
One reason, however, for not using aluminum in the foundry is
this, it makes the slag very brittle. This slag is apt to break away and
get into the mould. Aluminum iron does not unite well when two sur-
faces come together in a mould, this is another reason for not using it
for certain classes of work.
In conclusion I may say with Mr. Keep, that aluminum is not a safe
thing to use in the foundry.
Experiments were made with much smaller per cents, of aluminum
than is shown in the table, but with but little change to the castings.

TRANSMISSION OF POWER.
The methods of transmission that have been in vogue for a-great
number of years have been by means of shafts, gears, belts and ropes,
but are all confined to very short distances on account of the excessive
friction of the great weight of the materials used in transmitting the
power. They all require constant care and exact adjustment which pre-
cludes any idea of transmission by that means for any considerable dis-
tance.
Of the four mentioned, wire rope transmission is the most efficient
for long distances, but this also has its limit. Its superiority in efficiency
over other methods is limited to from three to four miles, as I will show
presently in a table of comparative efficiencies. The disadvantages of
wire rope transmission are that it is limited to deserted districts on
account of the danger from the high speed at which they must run, for
instance, 100 H. P. can be transmitted 120 yards without intermediate
supports, by an endless wire rope one-half inch in diameter over pulleys
thirteen to fourteen feet in diameter, making one hundred turns per
minute, which is equivalent to a velocity of the rope, upwards of four
thousand feet per minute. From this, it seems that we are limited to
the transmission of small power on account of the prohibitory sizes of
pulleys and also from the rapid decrease in efficiency from the bending
and centrifugal force to which the rope is subjected. It is also very
apparent that this means of transmission must be used in isolated places,
away from malicious persons or else must be covered or run through
tunnels—an expense that few would incur. The transmission must also
have a "bee line" between the two points, as its efficiency is consider-
ably reduced in being turned off at an angle by guide pulleys. The
materials must be of the very best to insure against breakage; yet this
is certainly the cheapest and most efficient means of transmission within
three or four miles. First—On account of the small cost in erecting same,
as compared with others; and, Secondly—As no motor or engine of any
kind is needed to utilize its power at the point to which it is transmitted.
Of course, when first installed, allowance must be made for stretching
of the wire rope, and the bearings of the pulleys must be carefully


89
adjusted. This latter objection is certainly true of other plants; but
they are all grouped in one central station, whereas the pulleys are dis-
tributed over the distance at regular intervals, and a constant surveil-
lance is therefore impossible.
We are now driven to consider the other means that are feasible and
practical for long distance transmission, which are by means of the fol-
lowing fluids or substances i. e., water, air, steam, and electricity. Of
these four, watertis the oldest means, and I will consider it first.
The use of hydraulic pressure for transmitting power dates from the
invention of the cup leather packing, by Brahmin, and the accumulator
• by Armstrong. Its most common usage has been in England, more than
any other place, and has been perfected and carried on on quite an
extensive scale there, especially in Hull and London. One favorable
feature of hydraulic transmission is the high pressure that can be
obtained, which permits the use of small pipes and cylinders in all
hydraulic machinery. This high pressure is best suited for cranes, ele-
vators, and all lifting machinery, where compactness and simplicity of
parts is desirable. One very convenient use of hydraulic power is the
movement and manipulation of the large Bessemer converters in steel
works. The water motor we all know has a very high efficiency, due to
its simple construction, but it is not economical, as it always works at
its maximum power whatever the load may be. Just as much water is
consumed whether it runs one machine or ten machines, and is not like
the steam engine, in which the consumption of steam is proportional to
the load attached.
One claim of the hydraulic transmission advocates was its import-
ance in extinguishing fires that may arise, but when tried it was found
that the stream at 700 pounds pressure was too strong to manage with a
hose and had such a great velocity that it was broken into a tine spray
at a short distance and the quantity was also found insufficient; but later
on a happy combination with the domestic supply furnished a stream
of 150 pounds, which was found very efficient.
An objection to hydraulic transmission, which may prove quite a
serious feature on a large scale, is the low velocity which the water must
have to prevent excessive shocks, on any sudden closing of valves, due
to the inelasticity and inertia of the water. These shocks may become
so great as to cause a large number of leaks or breaks. The leaks may
also be occasioned by the freezing of the pipes. This liability to occa-
sion great damage by leakage may sometimes drive it out of considera-


The Technic.
tion in choosing a system of transmission. Another thing which may
aid in some cases in cheapening hydraulic power is that the water need
not be chemically pure or suitable for drinking purposes, thus permitting
the use of any convenient stream.
In connection with this subdivision I think a short description of
the plant at Hull, England, would not be out of place, and thus give an
idea of the means in use to-day for hydraulic power transmission.
In the first place we must remember that this power at Hull is not
transferred from one station to another distant one, but over a sur-
rounding area of 3^1 square miles to numerous consumers.
The engines are capable of delivering 260 gallons per minute into
the accumulators at 100 pounds pressure per square inch. They have
2 accumulators with rams 20 inches in diameter and 23 feet stroke. The
mains are all 6 inches in diameter and they have about 50 miles of it.
The efficiency of the pump is 76 per cent, and the combined efficiency
has reached as high as 70 per cent. Whether this efficiency could be
attained on distant transmission is hard to say, but I think it would be
cut down considerably by the excessive friction in the pipes and valves.
The average charge for power is 1.25 per 1000 gallons used, as measured
by meters.
The next medium which we have to consider is air. In this we must
use larger mains than for water as we cannot obtain the high pressure
that is possible with water, as air is very elastic, and also the one diffi-
culty of attaining high pressure is the great loss of heat in compressing
the air which is so much work thrown away. One application of air
which is quite in its favor is its use in a simple steam engine without any
change of working parts of same. The friction of air in the pipes is
not very large and part is regained as it becomes heated from the fric-
tion and expands, thus increasing its volume and efficiency. The dan-
ger from leakage is a minimum for the consumers but a maximum on
the purse of the producer of compressed air. A leak in the air pipes is
very difficult to discover, unless the hissing sound of the escaping air is
heard. Compressed air has manj other uses besides that of power. The
air when expanded cold attains a very low temperature and can be
used for refrigeration and also as a means of ventilation which is some-
times a very important feature when power is wanted in con lined
spaces. The existing plants to-day of any importance for transmission
of power by compressed air are at Paris, France, and Birmingham, Eng-
land. Taking up the Paris plant first, which is the oldest, having been


91
installed about 1883, we find that its favor has increased to such an
extent that they erected six compound condensing engines a few years
ago to supply the increased demand. The plant has over 3,000 HP to-
day and transmits same over a distance of five miles from St Fauberg
to Paris.
The air is compressed to six atmospheres and is taken direct from
engine room at a temperature of 70 Fahr. The air is cooled by a jet of
water in cylinder which is admitted during each stroke. If the air were
compressed adiabatically it would attain a temperature of 430° which
is higher than steam at 300 lbs pressure per square inch. This is
cooled by the water to 150" Fahr., but as this is done after air is com-
pressed no benefit is derived from same to any extent. After com-
pressing the air it is conducted to reservoir when the entrained water
is drawn off. The air is then passed through the mains at a tem-
perature that air first had, 70° F. The mains are 12 inches in diame-
ter and f inch thick, and made of cast-iron perfectly plain on the
ends. They are connected by a simple external joint and made air-
tight with rubber packing rings, thus allowing considerable play
without leakage.
On entering a building on its way to a motor it passes through a
meter containing a six-armed fan, the number of revolutions of which
are taken and reduced to even feet by multiplying by a constant deter-
mined experimentally. The meter readings are all taken at atmos-
pheric pressure and a very ingenious device is used to allow for change
of pressure. The motion of the fan is conducted to the counter by
means of friction disks, one of which is raised or lowered, from center
as pressure is increased or lowered. After this the air is passed to a
reducing valve so as to maintain the pressure best suited for the motor
used. Between the motor and reducing valve is placed a heater to
increase temperature of compressed air and thus increase efficiency of
motors. This re-heating of the air has been found economical, as less
air is used by the volume being increased. The volume of air being
compressed per IHP was 348 cubic feet at atmospheric pressure. The
H30 injected filled clearance spaces. The efficiency of compressor
was found to be 61 per cent. The loss of pressure per mile was 1-10
atmosphere when IHP was 1200 at St. Fauberg, and maximum velocity of
air 1550 feet per minute. With an efficiency of valves and mains at 96
per cent, and a total reduction of one-half an atmosphere for five miles
we get the maximum possible work at motor as one-half IHP per IHP


The Technic.
at central station. Under these conditions minimum air used is twice
348 or 696 cubic feet per IHP.
Mechanical efficiency of motor cold was 67 per cent, and hot 81 per
cent., thus proving economy of re-heating the air before using.
In an actual test 890 cubic feet was used instead of 696, giving a total
efficiency of transmission of 39 per cent., or in other words, 2.6 IHP at
central station were required per IHP at motor assuming perfect effi-
ciency of motor, but taking 67 per cent, for motor 4.1 HIP were required,
at station per IHP at motor.
To examine economy of heating, air'was heated from 83° to 315°
Fahr. with .4 lbs coke per IHP which ought to give an increase in vol-
ume of 42 per cent. The volume used was 665 as against 890 cubic feet
cold, and efficiency of motor rose to 81 per cent., so that the real indi-
cated efficiency of transmission is 47 per cent, as compared with 39 per
cent. cold.
With higher temperature and correspondingly higher THP more
economical results were obtained and gave a total transmission effi-
ciency of 56 per cent.
Any system of transmission carried out on a large scale in such a
way as to give an efficiency of 50 per cent, between prime mover and
secondary motor needs no praise to commend it to notice, especially
where its convenience is so extremely great and its uses so varied as
those of compressed air. The figures just cited were taken from a
test in the latter part of 1889, or nearly three years ago and, with
the improvements which must have been made, I cannot doubt but
that they have reached an efficiency of 65 per cent, instead of 56 per
cent.
The absence of heat and leakage, and of noise and smell, in air
motors, is quite an item in its favor as well as the fact of its complete
safety. A reduction of insurance on account of absence of fire risks is
obtained. No discharge pipes are necessary as with H20 power, as air
can be exhausted directly into the room if re-heated.
The air motor seems to supply that most industrial want, a motor
for small industries, which can be carried on in the workman's home or
in any small work-shop; but one advantage that is paramount for cer-
tain purposes is its refrigerating properties, for it can be used to cool or
ventilate by its exhaust, to any extent. The sanitary advantage of this
in cases where work is carried on in confined spaces can hardly be exag-
gerated, as an unbearable atmosphere can be made quite pleasant by


93
■exhausting into the room. By using the air direct from mains, or heat-
ing slightly and then expanding, the exhaust can be so "greatly reduced
in temperature as to serve .for freezing purposes. A very common
practice in Paris is to utilize the work of the motor in charging storage
batteries for lighting purposes and exhaust for freezing. This property
is no doubt of great importance, and in tropical climates it is more of a
necessity than a luxury. In such cases, we might have the apparent
paradox of a motor working essentially for its exhaust. The work done
being secondary and cold air being the principal thing sought for. If
no useful work is to be done, it could be made to pump air back into
the mains and thus halve its consumption. This possibility of "laying
on" cold air is a very important matter in connection with the future
of compressed air. I see no reason why the radiator system used in
heating during the winter could not be used in circulating the cold
exhaust air from the motor during the summer.
In the Birmingham plant, 6,000 H. P. has been erected to deliver
compressed air at a uniform pressure of three atmospheres. This low
pressure is maintained, as they claim higher efficiency of plant. To be
sure, less heat is lost at compresson, but the higher the pressure of the
air the greater is the efficiency of same. There is a point where the loss
in the compressor just offsets the gain in efficiency of the air. It is
supposed to be between five and six atmospheres.
The next substance under consideration is by means of steam, but it
needs no second thought to see that it is wholly unsuitable for any dis-
tance, on account of large losses from radiation and condensation. A
large plant has been established in New York City, but has had consid-
erable trouble with the authorities on account of numerous explosions
from which man-hole covers were sent flying through the air, nearly
killing several persons. With this exception, it is certainly economical
for small districts; but what its efficiency is I am unable to state. Under
this same head may be classed the potential heat-force of fuel or the
transmission of it by means of natural gas from the oil wells of Penn-
sylvania. One notable case is a transmission of some to Pittsburgh, a
distance of twenty miles, and it is stated that the cost of manufacture
has been considerably lessened by this means. Nevertheless, this method
of transmission is purely local, and not capable of general application
and is favorable only to districts near oil regions. For this reason, it
will not be considered further in the comparison of the most economical
and efficient method of distant transmission.


The Technic.
We have now reached the only remaining means left to us and which
is certainly the*most formidable rival of all the systems I have men-
tioned, namely, electricity. This field is so vast that I fear I can scarcely
do justice to it, and it certainly takes considerable study to keep pace
with the discoveries and improvements that are being made every da}*.
The first efforts on distant electrical transmission was made by
Marul Desprez in 1880 at Paris. He had the generator and motor side
by side in the same building. The wire through which transmission
was made was extended a distance of 5} miles and back again to the
motor making a total length of 10J miles. The other 2 poles were
connected by a short conductor. The effect of this was the si me as if
the machines had been o\ miles apart. The number of revolutions
were taken simultaneously on both machines as well as the potential
differences at the poles. The power exerted by the motor was absorbed
by a Prony brake. From 6 experiments it was found that 6.2 H. P.
expended on generator gave a return of 2.1 H. P. at motor, a total
efficiency of 33.7%. Of course this was done nearly 10 years ago and
the continuous current machine was the only kind made then. The
objection of this type for long distance transmission I will speak of
later. The speed of the motor was only 74 per cent, of that of the
generator. One of the main places of loss was at the point of trans-
ference of current, or, at the brushes.
The chief problem that faces us is how to reduce to a miniimum
the waste of energy during transmission. To keep the resistance low,
copper of high conductivity must always be employed, but the practical
limit as regards the size of conductors is soon reached on account of the
high price of that metal. Speaking generally, it may be said that
transmission of energy to any distance by electricity is not economical,
if we depend on reducing waste of energy merely by increasing size of
conductors.
Now the energy of a dynamo, or the number of watts it can give,
equals the product of E. M. F. in volts and current in Amperes or E. C.
The waste energy or work lost in conductors, generators, etc.=C2 R for
a unit of time. From this last equation we see that the only way out
of the difficulty is to decrease the current strength, but it may not be
evident at first sight, how with this reduced current the same amount
of energy can be transmitted in an equal time.
Digressing for a moment, in order to introduce an analogy, we all
know that in transmitting power mechanically to a distance by a


slowly moving cable that the cable and the rest of moving parts should
be strong and massive and consequently the power lost by friction, etc.,
becomes enormous. Again we know that by increasing the speed of
the cable considerably we can reduce the size of the cable and moving
parts and still transmit the same power in the same time and so it is in
electrical transmission, that if we reduce the current and increase the
voltage we can transmit the same power and even more or less energy
is lost in heat.
Going back to our first point regarding the use of continuous
current dynamos we find that since a high voltage is necessary it must
be generated directly at the machine. Now it has been found impracti-
able through long experience to generate a higher voltage than from
3000-4000 volts which is rather low for any long distance transmission.
There are no means known to-day by which a high voltage continuous
current can be generated without moving machinery which needs great
care and is quite dangerous to handle, on account of excessive sparking
across the segments of the commutator. We see from this that the
only apparent solution is the use of alternating current dynamos, which
require no commutators. An alternating current of low tension can
be changed into one of high tension by the use of simple transformers
which are nothing but the well known induction coils having no
moving parts and requiring no attention.
The most notable case of long distance transmission by electricity
is the Lauffen-Frankfort transmission, a distance of 108 miles. The
main object of this plant was to show the feasibility of using very high
tension alternating currents on bare over head wires and a modified
alternating system for running motors. This plant was something of an
experiment as it was not known what new difficulties would be
encountered on the use of such high potential. The great objection to the
alternating current is the fact that it is not as well adapted for running
motors as a continuous current. The class of motors used are called
synchronous motors and are merely alternating current dynamos used
as motors. They must run at a speed which must synchronize with that
of the generator as if coupled together by an unseen shaft. They run
very well after they are started but often come to a dead stop if over-
loaded sufficiently to reduce their speed below that of synchronism.
This makes them unsuited for many purposes where constant power is
of importance. Again the motors cannot be started readily and all
load must be taken off before they can be started at all.


The Technic.
There are in general two methods for transmitting to great distances
by alternating currents. One is to generate the high tension currents
directly at the dynamo and transform it at the distant ends to low-
tension currents suitable for distribution to consumers. The second
method is to generate low tension current at the dynamo, then to
change it to high tension with step-up transformers at the dynamo
station. These high tension currents are then sent through the line to
distant points where they are transformed a second time to low tension
currents; this is the method used at the Lauffen-Frankfort plant.
The advantages of the former is that there is only one transforma-
tion; but a disadvantage which appears to outweigh the objection to an
additional transformation is that the high tension current must be
generated on moving machinery and controllcd.by complicated switches
and other apparatus which is a constant source of danger to the work-
men. This is entirely overcome with the use of transformers.
In the Lauffen-Frankfort experiment a large current of fifty volts
was generated and then transformed to a voltage of 16,000 which is 320
times as large. The current was therefore reduced ^ not counting
heat losses in transformation, and as the loss of energy in transmission
varies as the square of the current the loss was reduced (shr)! °r in
round numbers nnstav
As a partial solution of the motor problem the alternating system
known as the three phase system was used. This system involves the
use of three wires throughout in place of two; but, it is said to overcome
the difficulty of starting motors, and, in addition, that such motors are
simpler in construction than best continuous current motors, a feature
which counter-balances the objection to the use of three wires.
An analogy is made by Mr. Carl Hering, from whose paper I
obtained the greater part of this data on electrical transmission, that
the simple alternating and three phase systems were like the single and
three crank engines. The three phase systems consists of three simple
alternating currents—one in each wire. The waves or impulses in the
three wires following each other in succession similarly to the relative
motions of the three cranks of a triple cylinder engine or the pistons of
a three plunger plump. Such a set of currents produces a rotating
magnetic field, while the simple alternating current produces merely an
oscillating field. An interesting feature of this system is that although
the three currents have different phases they need no separate return
leads, because the nature of the currents is such that each acts as a


97
return for the other two in multiple arc, and are therefore connected
at a common terminal. The line consisted of three fine hard drawn
copper wires .15 in diameter, having a resistance of two ohms per mile.
The distance being 108.5 miles, the resistance in each wire was 217 ohms
which with five amperes makes a loss of about 1,000 volts on each of
the three lines. Large insulators eight inches in diameter were used
containing three oil grooves to prevent leakage. One fatal objection to
these overhead wires was the fact that all the posts were painted with
skull and cross bones, thus indicating sure death to any one getting a
shock. In crowded districts they would then be driven to run the wires
through pipes filled with oil for insulation. Even then the pipes might
mean death if the wires had any contact with its sides. The total
amount of transmission of this experimental plant was 200 H. P. which
they claim was not the maximum.
In conclusion I will state, that in all comparison between different
systems of power transmission precedents are very misleading unless
the fullest weight is given to the ever varying circumstances of each
case. In choosing a system of transmission we ask: What is the distance
over which the power is to be transmitted? For what purposes is it to
be utilized? What is the topography of the district over which the
power is sent? All these facts and many others are important factors
in the suitability of any system of transmission besides that of mere
efficiency.
The following table shows roughly the efficiencies of the most impor-
tant systems for various distances:

Falls Power Co's. plant that contracts to begin operation this Fall
in order to test thoroughly their relative merits. The very latest
improvements will be used and a thorough test will be made, the out-

RELATIVE COST OF PRIME MOVERS.
The natural sources of power are almost infinite in number, but
the principal ones to be considered are steam, water, hot-air, explosion
of gases, and wind-mills. But, of all our sources of power, no matter how
different their physical properties and laws of action are, the origin
is traceable to the one great source of power, the sun.
The choice and even the cost of a prime mover depends almost
entirely upon the location of the plant and the character of the work
which it has to do. Still, as some of the results of this paper will show,
conclusions must not be too hastily drawn.
The motive powers which we have to consider may be divided into
three classes: large, intermediate, and small. This division is necessary
when we consider that a prime mover which would be very efficient for
small power, would be entirely impracticable for large amounts of
power. In other cases the efficiency increases as the power which the
machine is required to develop increases.
By large powers, is meant sources of power from which we can
derive 300 H. P. and upwards. Under this class we consider water and
steam. In the intermediate class we can include H. P. from 300-50.
We find water, steam and gas engines in this division.
Under the head of small powers we have water, steam and gas
engines, hot-air and wind-mills.
I will first consider large powers which include only water, and
steam. The circumstances under which water and steam come into
competition depend entirely upon the geological situation and the
purposes to which they are to be applied. Let us first compare 1000
H .P. water-power and 1000 H. P. compound engine. The water is
furnished by a power company owning land upon which mills are
erected.
In considering the cost of a prime mover the following things
must be considered: interest on initial cost of plant, depreciation of
plant, which includes the repairs, cost of attendance, fuel, and lubri-
cation.

In case the exhaust steam could be used for heating purposes the
odds would be largely in favor of steam, but, if water is to be used in
large quantities, that form of power might be more profitable.
Charles T. Mains in his paper before the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers, cites the case of the water power at Lawrence,
Mass. He shows that the gross cost for 1000, H. P. by steam alone
would be $21.80 per H. P., or $.0597 per H. P. per day and the cost of
water power is about §19.13 or §.0524 per H. P. per day. This gives an
economy of §2670 per year in favor of water power.
Let us now consider the value of a power which is variable and
which cannot be relied on throughout the whole year. The variable
power has of course less value than the constant. If the variation
causes many days of complete or partial shut-downs, the power will be
of no value for most kinds of business, unless supplemented by steam
power, and if the total lack is for many days, the steam plant must be
of the same power as the water power used. We then have the expense
of maintenance of two plants and running of each a portion of the
time.
Take for example a power of 500 H. P. with a head of 28ft., costing
about §130 per H. P. of water plant. To this add §65, cost of steam
plant.


The fixed expenses are:
On water plant 8130X -09 $11.70
On steam plant $65.X.125 8.125
On both power plants 19.825
Running expenses for water power are $ 2.00
Cost of coal, $4.50 per ton, for two months 1.91
Attendance boilers and engines for two months .70
As steam is only used in summer and fall, we must •&gt; 2 ^
add cost of heating, which is J
Total cost power and heat per H. P 27.285
Cost per H. P. per day 0748
Deducting cost of heating, cost per H. P. per day 0669, This gives
a saving in favor of steam of $.0072 per day or .1314 per year for
500 H. P.
Under the head of intermediate powers we have to consider gas and
steam engines and water power.
The expenses for a 110 H. P. gas engine are as follows:
Cost of gas per H. P. per day at $1.00 per 1,000 cubic feet $.21
Lubrication and supplies 01
One-fourth of a days labor at $2.00 pen day 009
Depreciation and repairs at 10% on $4,700 0116
Interest on plant at 5 % 0058

The Technic.
The cost of the gas engine seems entirely out of proportion to that
of steam and water, but in competition with steam where the power is
to be used intermittently it might be as economical.
Under the class of small powers I have to compare an 8 H. P. gas
engine, 8 H. P. steam engine, a 2 H. P. hot air engine, 1.34 H. P. windmill.
The average consumption of gas in a gas engine per H. P., includ-
ing uniting flame, is about 30 cubic feet.
The water used in a gas engine for the jacket will not enter into the
calculation, since by the use of tanks the same water may be used over
again.
The gas engine requires little or no attention, a man only uses J
of his time in taking care of one.
I have considered the depreciation greater in the case of the gas
engine than in the case of steam.
The following is the numerical comparison of the cases in question:
Gas engine 8 H. P. (actual) 10 hours test
2,400 cubic feet gas at §1.50 per 1,000 93.60
Water 0.00
Lubrication and supplies 20

In this class we have the subject of wind-mills to consider. The
employment of wind-mills is necessarily restricted, owing to their uncer-
tainty. The results which are given farther on may be realized on the
average during 8-10 hours of the day. This restricts the employment of
wind-mills to such purposes, where either the nature of the work allows
of its being suspended, as in farm work, or where the work can be
stored, as in the pumping of water, compression of air, or for storing
electricity by means of dynamo machines and electric accumulators.
It can be used to develop power usually between .5—4 H. P. and
for such work as its intermittent character will not preclude its being
used. It is the most economical and servicable prime mover. The fuel
costs nothing. The attendance only consists in rilling three or four oil
cups once or twice a week; the cost of which amounts to nothing
practically.
The figures given below are from actual practice with hundreds of
wind-mills, and wind-mills have been sold guaranteed to realize the
results below:
1.34 H. P. (actual) 10 hours.
Interest on plant at 5% $.081
Cost of repairs 081

Lubrication and supplies 01
Cost per day for 1.34 H. P 117

In a letter from the Otto Gas Engine Co. they state the cost of run-
ning produced and natural gas engines as follows: the produced and
natural gas engines cost about one-half cent per hour or $.05 per day.
Actual test on gasoline engines show the cost to be about $.10 per
day. These figures do not take into account the interest on the invest-
ment or the depreciation and repairs.
In choosing a prime mover for any particular plant we must con-
sider certain things. Is the power to be used intermittently? In such
a case a gas engine or a water motor might be more economical. If
water is to be used in the mill in large quantities a natural water power
would probably be the most desirable, as in the case of the pulp mills.
Often the question of using the exhaust from the engine might make
steam the only power to be considered.
No exact conclusions can be drawn, as the circumstances under
which the prime mover operates may change the results materially. In
this paper I have given as far as possible general results which might
serve as a guide to the choice of a prime mover.
The figures given in this paper are not the result of the author's
experiments, but have been taken from the most reliable sources and
have been presented here for the purpose of comparison.

MISCELLANEOUS NOTES.
ELECTRICAL LABORATORY.
A number of important additions have been made to the Electrical
Laboratory during the year. In the first place the 25 H. P. Westing-
house engine, which was found to furnish insufficient power, was
replaced by a Bussell horizontal engine, capable of working
up to 70 H. P. at 270 revolutions per minute. At the same time a 3"
countershaft 20 feet long with one friction clutch and six pulleys, was
obtained from the Eclipse Clutch works. This countershaft is
supported on four pedestals, bolted to heavy piers of masonry, and
adjustable both vertically and horizontally. It runs at 400 revolutions
per minute.
Another valuable addition is a 300 light alternating dynamo made
by the Fort Wayne Electric Co. It has in reality a capacity of 20
kilowatts at lt&gt;80 revolutions. With it is an exciter, a complete outfit
of instruments for the switchboard, and converters of various sizes from
5 to 50 lights.
A bank of 224 incandescent lamps, additional to the 50 already
in the building, has been installed for experimental purposes. These
are arranged in such a way that they can be run either from converters
as 50 volt lamps, or in series of twos from a Fisher compound dynamo
of 100 volts constant potential. This' machine has a capacity of 15
kilowatts, and has just been completed on a special order for the
laboratory. The series coil can be cut out when desired, so that the
machine can be run also as a simple shunt machine.
The additions to the measuring apparatus comprise two more
Thomson balances, one capable of measuring up to 10 amperes and the
other to 100 amperes. These with the centi-ampere balance, purchased
some time since, are permanently set up in a convenient place so that
they can be used either in connection with the storage battery or with
the dynamos at pleasure.
From Nalder Bros, and Co. of London have been purchased a
tripod mirror galvanometer and a ballistic galvanometer of some

The Technic.
11,000 ohms resistance; also a 1000 resistance box, Ayrton and Perry's
secohmmeter and Ayrton's adjustable standard of self-induction,
graduated in millihenrys.
Two additional voltmeters have been purchased,—a Wist standard,
which is really a potentiometer employing standard cells, and a Weston
standard for alternating currents.
The alternating dynamo is now being fitted with the attachments
necessary to determine the curves of primary and secondary electro-
motive force and current. Arrangements will also be made to test the
efficiency of the converters by the most recent methods.
H. S. Carhart.
GRAPHICAL METHOD FOR POWERS OF NUMBERS.
It was probably explained to us when we were in Grammar school,
that if we multiplied a foot by a foot we would obtain a square foot, or
multiplying a square foot by a foot we would have a cubic foot.
It took a good deal of talking to convince us that this was a false
notion, and to show us that two concrete numbers could not be multi-
plied together. We finally understood that in order to have our result
in square feet our unit must also be in square feet. This was made
plain to us by marking out a square area one foot on a side to represent
one unit. Thus we were made to think of the square of any number as
representing an area and the
cube of any number as repre-
senting a volume.
Professor J. B. Davis has fur-
nished us with the following
graphical method of represent-
ing the different powers of a
number by straight lines. Let
the number be represented by
the tangent of an angle. Thus
in Fig. 1 let A B, the tangent of
the angle ABC, represent the
number, laid off to scale in which C B is unity.
Lay off A E perpendicular to A C, and produce C B till it cuts this
line; then BE will equal the square of A B.


107
For the triangle CAE being right angled, we have the proportion,
C B : A B :: A B . B E
or AB&gt; = CBXS E
but CB = 1
therefore A B* = B E = tang. A C B.
Next draw B D parallel to A C, and from E erect a perpendicular
to B E, cutting B D at D.
AB1 - DE = tang.8 ACB
= ABXSE.
The two figures combined here represent the values when the
number is greater or less than unity. Other functions could be used in
a similar manner.
From the preceding it would easily follow how to represent the
product of any two numbers by a straight line. Let a and c a represent
the numbers.
Find some number 6 such that a : b :: b : c or a c = W and proceed
as before. J. N. Hatch.
ENGINEERING BUILDING.
Upon returning to college next year the students of Engineering
will be gladdened by being installed in the new quarters now in process
of preparation for them.
An addition is building to what was formerly known as the Dental
Laboratory, extending north from and one story above the western half
of the old building. At the same time the interior of the old building
is being extensively remodeled.
The new wing has a frontage of some 50 feet to the west and 44 feet
to the north, and rises through three stories each 11 feet in height. In
the angle between the east wing of the old building and the main
portion of the new wing is an offset, or loga, 32x20ft., a part of whose
space is devoted to a series of short stairways and landings, winding
from an entrance hall-way at the ground floor up to the third story.
The building when completed will contain fifteen rooms available
for class-rooms, and store-rooms for models and apparatus, with one for
the Engineering Society. These rooms are apportioned seven to the
first story, six to the second, and two very large and well-lighted rooms
to the third story. These third-story rooms have spaces 18 feet high


The Technic.
between the roof-trusses and will probably be used to some extent for
setting up large models. The east wing of the old building will have
but two stories as before.
There will be about 1200 square feet of floor space not including
hallways and offices. That portion of the loga not taken up by the
stairway is occupied at each story by a snug office room 12ft.X'3ft. 5
inches, which by virtue of its situation is readily accessible from all the
class-rooms on that .floor and at the same time in direct communication
with the entrances to the building. The main entrance is at the west
front. An arched doorway opens into a hallway 8 feet wide, extending
through the building to the foot of the stairway.
The new structure is of brick and is to be stuccoed on the outside
to harmonize with the old building. The roofing is of American tin,
manufactured at Pittsburg, Pa. The exterior of the building as a
whole, though not unsightly, is exceedingly plain and free from
ornamentation save the modest arch at the main doorway over which
is to be cut in the stone the name," Engineering Building." The open
winding stairway is of oak and is enclosed by walls of pressed brick the
floors are of Georgia pine, and the other woodwork of pine, oiled.
The building will be heated by steam and is being wired for electric
light. Ventilation has received due attention, there being two large
ventilating flues through which draughts are induced by the occasional
introduction of coils of steam pipe. Certain of the rooms are provided
•with water-faucets and sinks. A toilet room will be located in the
basement.
The interior of the building while by no means elegant will yet be
quite pleasant, roomy, and well adapted to the uses to which it will be
put. The first and second floors of the new building will be largely
devoted to the work of Professor Greene and Professor Cooley, the
large rooms on the third floor to Professor Denison, and the east wing
to the work in surveying under Professor Davis. A room on the first
floor will be used as the Engineering Society library and reading room.
The transfer to the new building will be hailed with joy by
professors and students alike, for none can fail to appreciate the great
advantage of this over the old " catch as catch can" arrangement that
has more or less handicapped engineering work in the University for
some time past. With better opportunities, in this more technical
atmosphere, professional enthusiasm must surely lay stronger hold on
the student. H. Baldwin.

It is a matter of general regret to the engineering students that
the Society Library and Reading Room have been during the past
year in an unsettled condition owing to their somewhat temporary
location. With the permanent quarters, expected durijig the coming
year, no pains should be spared to have the room provided with tables
and well supplied with the leading engineering periodicals and ex-
changes.

It will no doubt be noticed that in the pages given to chronicle the
second annual Engineering Society Banquet somewhat of a departure
has been made. The three pages are an exact reproduction of the
souvenir program of that evening which gives a better account of what
transpired than could be otherwise stated. We were honored with the
presence of President Angell and several of the Engineering Faculty.
Some of the responses were witty while others were filled with ideas and
thought that will be long remembered by those who listened. The ban-
quet was well attended and the refreshments were the very best.

The Technic is again late in appearing notwithstanding the fact
that the board has not let the matter lag at any time since college
opened. It is more a growth than a production and if it is to appear
before the close of the term in June steps must be taken by the new
board to have all the copy in the printers hands by the 15th of April
at the very latest. To do this will require considerable pushing for the
first month or six weeks after which the work becomes routine until the-
final close of affairs. The board wish to thank the contributors and the-
advertisers for their co-operation in making the volume of "92 what it is.
