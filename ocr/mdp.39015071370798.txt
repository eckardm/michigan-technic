$44,000 in cash awards!
American Bridge Division of United
States Steel announces a $44,000
Steel Highway Bridge Design
Competition dedicated to stimulat-
ing the engineering mind to a more
imaginative, more effective use of
steel in the construction of small
bridges.
If you, as a professional or design
engineer or as a college engineering
student, can come up with a more
imaginative, attractive and econom-
ical design, not only may you win
up to $15,000 in award money, but
your efforts may contribute mate-
rially to the most challenging road-
building program ever undertaken.
For, according to conservative esti-
mates, the tremendous 41,000-mile
Federal Highway Program will call
for the construction of at least a
bridge a mile!
The competition involves solving
a relatively simple but important
problem that will not demand too
much of your time.

If you're the kind of engineer who wants to do big things
in a big way, perhaps General Motors has a place for
you.
For at GM, "The Inquiring Mind" is free to roam —free
to explore the scientific world in an effort to find new
and better roads to progress.
And the men who search for—and find—these new paths,
also find opportunity without limit.
For GM is quick to recognize ability —quick to reward
it with ever-increasing responsibility —quick to promote
talented men to supervisory and executive positions
throughout its organization.
TEAMMATES—Young physicist Donald Swets—MS 1955—teams up
with GM Research Laboratories physicist Robert C. Frank (r.) to use
mass spectrometer for basic research on gases in metals. Glass tubing
apparatus was developed specifically for this GM Research project.
Where will you use your abilities and talents? The fields
cover the entire spectrum of engineering and science.
Automobiles, trucks, locomotives, aircraft, yes. But
power transistors and solar energy, too. Astronautics,
astrodynamics and electronics, as well. Rocket propul-
sion, missile guidance, the entire field of space engi-
neering and science are all concerns of various General
Motors Divisions.
And you will not necessarily be confined to just one of
these fields. Depending on where your talents lie, you'll
find yourself concerned with many fields at various
times.
Breaking barriers of technology is a specialty with the
engineers and scientists who work at General Motors'
35 Divisions and 126 plants in 71 cities and 19 states —
and at our Technical Center near Detroit. If that's the
kind of work that fascinates you, let us hear from you.

"...versatility recognized"
♦Arthur Herman graduated from Johns Hopkins
in 1955 and went to work immediately in the Metal
Products Division of Koppers as a Design Engineer.
In December of the same year, he was promoted
to Supervising Engineer of the Design Section,
where he found that Koppers offers truly challeng-
ing problems in design engineering.
Then, in September 1957, Art was transferred
to the Coupling Sales Department as a Coupling
Application Engineer. He is serving in that
capacity now.
An employment record alone is seldom descrip-
tive of the opportunities and responsibilities many
positions represent. For instance, Art was recently
designated as Division Representative to investi-
gate the potentialities of a new product developed
by a European manufacturer. This assignment
took him abroad.
Art is particularly articulate about his job and
the constant challenge it presents for him as an
individual.
"When I first started as a design engineer," he
said, "I didn't realize the scope of activities in
which I'd be called on to participate. Sure, I had
good theory and background for design engineering,
but I had little concept of the problems of produc-
tion, and even less familiarity with the techniques
of sales or marketing. My work as an application
engineer gets me into almost every phase of the
business — development, production, marketing,
finance, and so forth.
"At Koppers I feel that I receive the necessary
guidance to enable me to contribute fully to the
Company's activities. I am encouraged to make
decisions. If these decisions involve factors with
which I am not entirely familiar, I can rely on the
judgment and experience of others working with
me. At all times, I feel that I have real access to
upper levels of management where my ideas have
always been received thoughtfully and given full
consideration. Now, I feel confident that I am
doing a job for Koppers, and, what is equally
important, that my associates and supervisors
understand and appreciate it, too! I have found
that through such methods as the Management
Appraisal Program, Koppers makes every effort
to recognize and reward good performance."
A lot of things could be said about Art Herman,
and the career he found at Koppers. But as the
manager to whom Art reports commented recently:
"Art's an able man . . . we're glad to have him. He
is making a real contribution to the Company.
All we in management can do is try our best to
develop a man's best qualities and, when he proves
to have the versatility that Art has, to see that
this versatility is recognized."
If you feel that this is the atmosphere in which
you would most like to build your profession and
mark your progress, write to the Manager of Man-
power Planning, Koppers Company, Inc., Pitts-
burgh 19, Pennsylvania or contact your College
Placement Director.

More than a month has passed since you arrived in Ann Arbor, begin-
ning your careers in the engineering profession. These forty days have
probably been some of the fastest (and slowest) days you've ever lived
through, but you've undoubtedly learned more in this forty-day period
than ever before.
It's common knowledge that you've been packed full of figures, but I
want to add a few that the books and lecture notes won't reveal. There are
over six hundred of you now. When graduation rolls around (after the fast-
est four years of your life), two hundred of you will own the time-honored
sheepskin as engineers; about two hundred more of you will find your-
selves in other schools and colleges of the University, at or near gradua-
tion. The remaining thirty per cent or so of the freshman class will have
departed, for the most part during the first year. This question of survival
is a great one in the eyes of just about every freshman, so I want to add the
encouragement I can to that which I'm sure has been given you by every-
one, from the University President to the house mascot.
I feel a welcome is a little superflous at this stage, since you've been
quite thoroughly welcomed already. Encouragement might be a little more
practical. But, anyway, to get to the essence of this page, it should be said in
simple words, "It's up to you." That's all—I know, you've already heard it
many times, since even before high school graduation, but every year,
those that pack their bags early do so usually because they were hunting
for the short cut, the crutch, or spent too many hours each week with their
heads buried in "Playboy" instead of analytic geometry. You've already
made decisions to yourself about who is going to stay and who you'd bet
your last football ticket would flunk out by the end of the semester. And,
you know why. The important thing is to miss the same pitfall yourself.
But, the straight and narrow can be too much so. A bookworm is no
more popular here than back home, so (unless you hate football) don't
stay home next Saturday afternoon to study—you can't be that desperate.
(If you are, give me a phone call; I know some good tutors). It takes many
facets to live the college life which genuinely benefits the student. In your
four years (or more) at Michigan, there'll be places you'll never visit; there'll
be buildings between South State and East U. that you'll never enter (look
this one up in four years), no matter how diverse your campus life is. So,
you can suit yourself as to what you want. Both extremes will irreparably
hurt your career, but the straight and not-so-narrow is just that. I hope
you enjoy Michigan as much as we of the "Technic" have. And come up
and see us some time (3077 EE); we're always looking for some poor soul to
clean out the magazine racks.
—M. A. W.

Westinghouse is the best place
for talented engineers
Howard Zollinger joined Westinghouse in 1951—
has since earned MSEE and two U. S. patents
At 28, Howard A. Zollinger, a 1951 BSEE graduate of
Michigan College of Mining and Technology is doing
". . . exactly what I always wanted to do." Now a
systems design engineer, he specializes in the develop-
ment of modern materials handling systems to support
increasingly automated production techniques. Since
completion of the Westinghouse Student Training Course
in 1952, he has earned an enviable reputation as an
expert in drive systems; and he has submitted fifteen
patent disclosures, two of which are about to result in
patents in his name.
Most important, Howard Zollinger is doing exactly
what he wants to be doing. At the completion of his train-
ing course, he specifically asked that he be assigned to
his present department. And, when he decided that
additional graduate study would be helpful, the West-
inghouse Graduate Study Program enabled him to
combine this study with his regular job. After complet-
ing all required course work and his thesis last December,
he was awarded his MSEE by the University of Pitts-
burgh in June.
Howard Zollinger is one of many talented young
engineers who are finding rewarding careers with West-
inghouse. You can, too, if you've got ambition and you're
a man of exceptional ability. Our broad product line
and decentralized operations provide a diversity of
challenging opportunities for talented engineers. Guided
missile controls, atomic power, automation, radar, semi-
conductors, and large power equipment are only a few of
the fascinating career fields to be found at Westinghouse.
Why not find out now about the opportunities for you
at Westinghouse? Write to Mr. L. H. Noggle, Westing-
house Educational Center, Ardmore &amp; Brinton Roads,

Why Lockheed-
Lockheed's leadership in aircraft is continuing in missiles. The Missile
Systems Division is one of the largest in the industry and its reputation
is attested by the number of high-priority, long-term projects it holds:
the Polaris IRBM, Earth Satellite, Kingfisher (Q-5) and the X-7.
To carry out such complex projects, the frontiers of technology in all
areas must be expanded. Lockheed's laboratories at Sunnyvale and
Palo Alto, California, provide the most advanced equipment for research
and development, including complete test facilities and one of the
most up-to-date computing centers in the nation. Employee benefits
are among the best in the industry.
For those who qualify and desire to continue their education, the
Graduate Study Program enables them to obtain M.S. or Ph.D degrees
at Stanford or the University of California, while employed in their
chosen fields at Lockheed.
Lockheed Missile Systems Division was recently honored at the first
National Missile Industry Conference as "the organization that
contributed most in the past year to the development of the art of
missiles and astronautics!'

A Division of Avco Manufacturing Corporation/Everett, Mass.
The Avco Research Laboratory was
founded a little more than three years
ago for the purpose of examining high-
temperature gas problems associated with
ICBM re-entry. The success of this
research led to the birth of a new cor-
porate enterprise, Avco's Research and
Advanced Development Division.
The Research Laboratory, now estab-
lished as a separate Avco division, has
expanded to embrace all aspects of physi-
cal gas dynamics. We are currently gravid
with several embryonic projects which we
anticipate will likewise grow into new
corporate enterprises. Our work in the
physics, aerodynamics and chemistry of
high-temperature gases is growing in the
following areas:
Magneto hydrodynamics —
Flight and industrial power-
generation applications
Space flight—
Manned satellites
Electromagnetic propulsion
These developments have created a num-
ber of openings for physicists, aerody-
namicists and physical chemists. If your
background qualifies you to work in any
of these areas, we would be pleased to
hear from you.

Herbert Spencer...on genesis or science
"Without further argument it will, we think, be admitted
that the sciences are none of them separately evolved —
are none of them independent either logically or histori-
cally; but that all of them have, in a greater or less degree,
required aid and reciprocated it. Indeed, it needs but to
throw aside hypotheses, and contemplate the mixed
character of surrounding phenomena, to see at once that
these notions of division and succession in the kinds of
knowledge are simply scientific fictions: good, if regarded
merely as aids to study; bad, if regarded as representing
realities in Nature. No facts whatever are presented to our
senses uncombined with other facts — no facts whatever
but are in some degree disguised by accompanying facts:
disguised in such a manner that all must be partially
understood before any one can be understood."

BENEFIT PROGRAM
MEANS ADDED INCOME
by E L. Johns
Du Pont personnel representative

Don't forget the "extras" of an em-
ployee benefit program when you com-
pare the job offers and salaries of
different companies. At Du Pont, these
extras mean added income that doesn't
always meet the eye. They include
life insurance, group hospitalization
and surgical coverage, accident and
health insurance, pension plan and
paid vacation.
In addition, the Company sponsors
a thrift plan. After two years of serv-
ice, for every dollar you invest in
U. S. Savings Bonds the Company sets
aside 25 cents for the purchase of
common stock in your name. Roughly,
60.000 of our employees are now par-
ticipating in this plan.
If you have specific questions on
Du Pont benefits, just send them to
me. I'll be happy to try to answer
them. E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.

What are Russian scientists up to
now?
Few people in America are better
able to answer this question than a
mild-mannered, unobtrusive man
dressed Like other business executives
on Chicago's Michigan Avenue.
There is no cloak-and-dagger
atmosphere surrounding Jacob G.
Tolpin.
It has been the daily job of Mr.
Tolpin since 1937 to keep track of
Russian scientific advances. He is a
key man on the staff of specialists at
Standard Oil who analyze foreign
technical journals and patents.
The primary purpose of this work
is to keep Standard Oil research sci-
entists informed of developments
throughout the world. But the work
has broader significance. Standard Oil
furnishes important foreign technical
data to nationally important bodies
and to libraries, such as the Library
of Congress. The knowledge gained
from the foreign periodicals thus is
made available to all.
Even the Russians admit, says Mr.
Tolpin, that American knowledge of
petroleum technology is superior to
their own. Standard's research at
Whiting and other centers has re-
sulted in many important discoveries
which have helped to make America
supreme in the field of petroleum and
to strengthen its defenses. In the last
few years alone, Standard scientists
have made outstanding contributions
that have advanced America's missile
program and its jet air defense.
Since our first laboratory opened 68
years ago, we have spent hundreds of
millions of dollars to learn more about
oil—how to find it, produce it, refine
it and make it more useful to more
people than ever before.
What makes a company a good citizen?
One measure is the contribution a
company makes to the economic and
physical strength of its country.
Through constant and intensive re-
search, we at Standard have tried to
make oil yield its maximum useful-
ness—both for civilian and military
purposes. Steadily mounting efficiency
also has helped to keep the price of oil
and gasoline down.

Engineer and Architect alike must be aware
of the direction in which current building design
is heading. Organic architecture has its roots
far back in the history of America bringing
familiar memories to the reader. by BERNARD H. STOLLMAN, '59E
This front porch view of a
home designed by Richard
Neutra strikingly combines
the beauties of nature and
modern architecture.
Though the number of people con-
nected with the building industry
increases every year, the number of in-
dividuals with any understanding of the
aesthetics involved in building design
seems to decrease annually. There was
a time when a person wishing to show
any refinement of taste would have to
be acquainted with the intricacies of
Greek or Roman architecture. Nowadays
the average architect seems to have a
pattern to work from and American
building has consequently assumed a sort
of impersonal, luxurious vacuity which
says little or nothing about its occupants.
For all practical purposes, the architect,
like the engineer, is designing according
to formulae and has forgotten that his
medium is as much an art form as is
painting or sculpture. The fault lies not
alone with the architect but with all who
are connected with the industry. Lack of
imagination or desire to create personal,
individualistic buildings is shown by
engineer and contractor alike. The engi-
neer, as much as the architect, must un-
derstand that sound design is as impor-
tant, if not more so than the soundness
of the structure.
What makes design so important?
Why is architecture the same as painting
or sculpture? What can the engineer do?
An understanding of how American
architecture has developed will help an-
swer these questions.
Architecture today is tending toward
the organic. The quality inherent in
practically all the superior work done
in this country today is one of indige-
nousness, of harmony with purpose, site,
and creator. Influence from abroad is
undoubtedly strong. The fact that so
many superior architects from overseas
are now practicing here shows how
readily we accept European and Asian
ideas. Yet the quality that makes these
architects superior is not their insistence
on a particular school or style but on
their ability to mold American forms
out of American soil. It is a foreign
refinement no doubt, but the buildings
are faithful to the men who live in
them and to the ground on which they
stand.
The idea of intrinsic, original archi-
tecture is not new to this country. True,
innately American forms have been cre-
ated before but far too infrequently.
When the early settlers came to
this world ,they brought various Euro-
pean cultures with them. To these people
the habits and customs of the Old World
represented religious and moral security.
Yet the influence of a new world, of a
new kind of freedom tended to weaken
these habits as time passed. In the battle
to survive, their places of origin were
almost completely forgotten. Life was
not easy; to those who settled new land
there came the hazards of Indians, dis-
ease, crop failure and a thousand others.
As Moholy-Nagy pointed out, "the land-

takers planned their human and vegeta-
tive resources with the same care and cun-
ning of their Neolithic ancestors." Their
homes were, in actuality, shelters. They
had no time for the ornament that they
recalled from Europe. The home was the
center of their lives; when they could
they molded it to express their fears and
aspirations. The rare decoration they
added, the lines carved into the roof and
walls were of them in the same way that
they were of the earth they farmed.
This was an indigenous architecture.
The buildings that survive from this early
period testify to the originality of their
creators though no doubt it was often
only a half articulated originality. Every
foot of these houses were functional, yet
they often were treated with fondness,
with an appreciation for the service they
performed.
When towns and villages were formed,
a system of craft guilds began. These
craftsmen were more conscious of their
European heritage than the early settlers.
There was a classical touch about their
work though basically they were creating
new forms. The carpenter was both the
builder and the architect. He loved his
work as much as any artist today. Af-
fected by life in the new world, he ex-
pressed it with loving care on the forms
he produced. The European influence
is undeniable but yet the work is orig-
inal and spontaneous.
The eighteenth century saw the cessa-
tion of craft guilds and the beginning
of professional architects and formal
plans. The carpenter no longer designed
the building; an architect with a "classi-
cal" education was responsible for the
shape of the final structure.
The link with European culture was
strengthened. Traffic between the two
continents increased and more Americans
became aware of the forms being created
in Europe. Many European architects
began to work in the New World. The
ties with Europe were so numerous that
it is not surprising that American build-
ing was just a copy of that across the
Atlantic.
The American Revolution proclaimed
the freedom of the New World from the
"In a beautiful forest, a solid high rock
ledge rising beside a waterfall, the
natural thing seemed to be to cantilever
the house from that rock-bank over the
falling water. The first house in my
experience to be built of reinforced
concrete—so the form took the gram-
mar of that type of construction."—
Frank Lloyd Wright.
Old. Though the people declared their
independence, architecture continued to
limp along, repeating European ideas and
forms. The Adams-Georgian and the
Federal styles were neither original nor
American. What was not copied directly
from England and France was stolen or
borrowed, as you wish, from the Greek,
Roman and Byzantine periods in history.
No doubt it was a refinement of sorts.
The fine balance and harmony of the
Adams-Georgian style is undeniable yet
it was false to the men who built and
lived in houses of that type. Men who
had gambled their lives in the fight for
political and economic freedom, who de-
clared the rights of the individual, could
express themselves only through a style
which bound them hand and foot.
As Europe launched into a period of
neo-classicism in the nineteenth century,
the United States followed suit. Private
homes had all the massiveness of Greek
temples, government buildings exalted
the monumentality of Rome. A few sig-
nificant buildings were completed during

this period; Thomas Jefferson's Univer-
sity of Virginia being the finest. How-
ever, the majority of the work during
this period showed coherence but no
individuality" as Lewis Mumford puts it,
and have little worth except for historical
interest.
The industrial revolution brought no
immediate change in American archi-
tecture. Architects failed to realize that
the entire mechanics of building had been
altered by this discovery. A Romanesque
movement followed the neo-classic. It
was a turn towards more natural forms,
the use of natural stone rather than
carved columns. New methods and ma-
terials brought an end to this romantic
trend and an age of greater understand-
ing of the machine was begun. New
concepts in engineering, and an aware-
ness of their concepts on the part of the
architect were primarily responsible for
this change.
Louis Sullivan was the originator of
the concept of "organic" architecture. He
realized the decadence in which America
was sheltered. He was concerned with
the freedom of the individual, with the
idea of democracy. He began a style
which was intrinsic to American culture.
The idea that man was of the soil, that
he was rooted to it by his very nature
produced an architecture which was
wedded to the earth. A building was to
be a growing organism, each part the
concern of the whole.
Sullivan's ornament expressed his idea
of freedom but he was unsuccessful at
achieving buildings as whole organisms.
His facades were perfectly executed but
he had no sense of interior space or of
freedom of movement. His student,
Frank Lloyd Wright, discovered the
reality of space in motion before the
turn of the century. His low-slung,
natural forms completely stunned a pub-
lic accustomed to pilasters and pediments.
To understand the schools that have
arisen in the United States and abroad
it is convenient to adopt the simplified
viewpoint ofSigfried Giedion: "Through-
out history there persist two distinct
trends—the one toward the rational and
the geometrical, the other toward the
irrational and the organic."
The age of the machine brought a
movement toward functionalism, toward
the erasure of decorative ornament and
the use of steel, concrete and glass to
span relatively huge areas. Movements
such as the Arts and Crafts Movement
tended to idealize modern technology,
and engineering. These movements
gradually subsided but they left many
young architects with strong ideas about
machine aesthetics.
In 1919, Walter Gropius organized
the Bauhaus school in Germany. The
central idea was to promote a greater
understanding of man's social problems
and at the same time develop, in the
architect, an appreciation for the mate-
rials used in construction and an under-
standing of the importance of machinery
technology. The Bauhaus school influ-
enced all of Europe and also much of
the U. S.
For many years, Le Corbusier in France
has been doing work which is the direct
antithesis of the organic trend in the
U. S. To Corbu (Le Corbusier) the im-
portant element in design is space, but
space permeating the building through
geometrically shaped openings. The
space flows in and out simply because
the plan is open, the interior clearly
visible from the exterior. The shape of
the entire building is almost cubistic,
stereometric. Though architecture itself
is an abstract medium, Corbu designs the
facades as though they were two dimen-
sional and, with careful openings and
enclosures, creates the feeling of space
floating through an abstract painting.
Whereas Wright feels an almost psy-
chological need to bring his buildings
down to earth and requires that the ex-
terior be a function of the interior space,
i.e., the building must grow from the
inside outwards, Corbu observes nature
from a distance. He raises his buildings
on pilotis (stilts) and lets nature pass
underneath; he wants to observe nature
not join with it. Corbu builds from the
exterior inwards. Within the shell
formed by walls and roof, he designs
living spaces. The anonymous architec-
ture of the pioneers was organic in that it
grew outward, adding rooms when nec-
essary, surrounding living space with
walls and roof. The modern housing
development parallels Corbu; a cube or
rectangular box is divided into living
areas.
Corbu's ideas have grown out of the
idea that form follows function—that
the flat, functional surface has an in-
herent abstract beauty. Again, where
Corbu searches for the ideal form,
Wright is concerned with the specific
need and reality of the place, time and
people involved.
Wright's greatest achievement is his
realization that interior space is not a
negative quantity, that it is "positive
reality." A house must be organic, con-
tinuous, an integral whole. In the same

LUNAR POWER PLANT
The photoelectric phenomenon shows a vast
potential for extremely low-weight, high power
generation in the space environment. With so
much scientific and political emphasis placed on
the strategic value of operations on the moon,
photoelectricity will play an important role as
a source of lunar power. by DR. PETER CASTRUCCIO
Every time a vehicle is launched into
space, it must overcome the gravi-
tational pull of the Earth by reaching
escape velocity. The energy requirements
for this feat are well known to the rocket
engineer, and can be concisely expressed
in terms of the required mass ratio:
Jf
Mo = e Is|g
Me = where
Mo -= take-off mass
Me = mass at burnout
Jf = characteristic velocity
of mission
I„„ = specific impulse
of fuel
g = acceleration of gravity
Escape velocity equals 11.2 Km/sec; to
this must be added gravity, air friction
and guidance losses, which raise the total
characteristic velocity considerably.
With present-day fuels (I,p ^ 250),
the effective required mass ratio becomes
180, meaning that every pound propelled
to escape velocity requires a take-off
weight of at least 180 lbs. Since this is
not achievable with a single stage, the
take-off weight is further significantly
increased by the necessity for multi-stag-
ing.
For actual interplanetary missions,
additional characteristic velocity is re-
quired to accomplish the necessary trans-
fer orbits, the midcourse guidance func-
tion, and the terminal orbiting or landing
functions. Finally, of course, for the
return trip, the mass ratio requirements
achieve such proportions that even mod-
est payloads propelled on interplanetary
missions requires truly enormous take-
off weights.
The use of Earth satellites has been
suggested as refueling stations for inter-
planetary ships. Since these space sta-
tions already travel at speeds of the order
of 8 Km/sec, the additional velocity
increment to achieve escape is only of
the order of 3 Km/sec and the mass
ratio are much reduced. It should be
noted, however, that in terms of the
total expenditure of fuel and materials,
the satellite space station represents no
savings; its primary utility is the reduc-
tion in the size of the take-off rockets,
so that instead of a single huge rocket
a number of smaller ones could be em-
ployed. To achieve a true saving, we
need a base in the sky capable of yield-
ing its own rocket fuel and possibly its
own rocket structures. The only such
base available to us today is the Moon.
Since the Moon's escape velocity is
only 2.4 Km/sec, its air-frictional losses
are nil and its gravity losses are much
reduced; the total characteristic velocity
to achieve escape from the Moon is of
the order 3 Km/sec. The required mass
ratio becomes then of the order of 3
(for IB1) = 250) as against the previ-
ously calculated value of 180 for escape
from Earth.
The strategic advantages of a self
suporting lunar base are obvious from
the following simple considerations: to
bombard the Earth with a nuclear war-
head from the Moon (Figure 1), a take-
off weight of about 3,000 lbs. is re-
quired. Practically any small rocket can
do this. On the other hand, to launch
the same warhead from Earth to bomb
the Moon requires a take-off weight of
the order of 500,000 lbs. A military
base on the Moon is thus in the enviable

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


mountain: it can easily rain projectiles
into the valley, but is almost invulnerable
to a valley-bound adversary.
It would, however, not be practical to
construct a base on the Moon with the
intent of supplying it entirely from
Earth. The logistics are shown in Figure
1: a nuclear warhead lifted from Earth,
landed on the Moon, stored there and
subsequently relaunched towards Earth
would require with advanced propellants
an initial take-off weight of the order
of 2 million pounds. By contrast, an
ICBM to accomplish essentially the same-
purpose requires a take-off weight of
only 100,000 pounds. A similar balance
applies to using the Moon as an inter-
planetary stopping point, since the char-
acteristic velocity of an interplanetary
mission is increased in this case by more
than twice the lunar escape velocity.
To make the Moon into a practical
strategic base and jumping off station
for further exploration of space it is
necessary to make the Moon self suffi-
cient. In other words, the Moon must
be made to yield all or most of the
materials and products required by the
missions. Basically, these can be divided
into: biological materials required for
the support of the lunar task force, pri-
marily oxygen, water, and food; mate-
rials for the construction of shelters and
other necessities of human survival such
as plastics and materials; and rocket
materials such as the all-important fuel
plus materials for the construction of
suitable rocket structures. It is interest-
ing to note that moon-made Earth bom-

bardment rockets can be constructed out
of concrete or similar materials in view
of the very small ratios required.
One is thus led to envision a complete
and essentially self-supporting lunar set-
tlement, which would have the threefold
purpose of scientific observatory, inter-
planetary take-off station, and strategic
military base. Figure 2 illustrates a form
for such a lunar settlement, consisting
of a network of caves dug out from a
lunar mountain. The concept of the
strategic base is of course fundamental
to military planners, the effort and ex-

pense of establishing the base are com-
pensated at the end by superior strategic
advantage. Perhaps one of the most
striking illustrations of this technique is
afforded by Hannibal's Strategy in the
Second Punic War (Figure 3): instead
of thrusting directly at the enemy along
the shortest—and best defended—route,
he elected to follow a much longer and
burdensome path, with the aid of a main
base in friendly territory. The effort ex-
pended paid off well in terms of military
success, since he was able to move his
elephants (the nuclear warheads of the
day) and troops into a strategically
superior position.*
It is likely that on, or reasonably near
the surface of the Moon, a number of
technologically usable materials may be
found. After their abundance, qualities,
and locations are ascertained, suitable
technologies can be developed for their
extraction and subsequent transformation
into useful products. As a simple ex-
ample, should the lunar surface prove
abundant in silicon oxide, oxygen can
be extracted by the application of suffi-
cient heat. The presence of hydrides or
other hydrogen-containing compounds
can be used for the extraction of hy-
drogen; the combination of oxygen and
hydrogen yielding then water. Food can
be grown in suitably protected hydroponic

U.S. AIRWAYS
With tragic mid-air collisions increasing at
a rapid rate, the Technic takes a look at steps
that will reverse this trend.
by TOM ADAMS, '60E
Today's increasingly frequent mid-air
collisions of commercial, military,
and private planes are disasters of such a
spectacular nature that their causes are
often obscured in the flood of newspaper
headlines that follows. Close on the
heels of these paper-selling superlatives
comes public indignation and confusion.
But amid all the confusion the experts
agree that considerable headway is being
made in solving this serious traffic prob-
lem. In the following paragraphs we
will examine this situation as it now
stands and see just what is being done
to alter it.
The first and most basic question to
be solved in this situation is one of
separation, for it is obvious that if two
aircraft are flying along separate paths
they cannot collide. The planning of
this separation procedure is done by the
Civil Aeronautics Board, and is enforced
by the Administrator of Civil Aero-
nautics and his Civil Aeronautics Ad-
ministration (CAA) in so far as the
rules which apply to Commercial Car-
riers, and what we shall call general
aviation, are concerned. The execution
of the separation in three dimensions is
carried out by the highly trained CAA
air controllers and by the individual
pilot. The pilot of the airline is highly
trained, and the private or general pilot
is at least more highly trained and care-
fully licensed than the general automo-
bile driver. The combined record of these
men is good. But so long as the execu-
tion of the rules leads to one mid-air
collision, either the rules or their execu-
tion must be improved.
VFR vs. IFR
In terms of the execution of the sepa-
ration between aircraft there are two
types of flights to be considered, whether
commercial or not. First of these is the
flight which originates at airport A and
flies to airport B under VFR (visual
flight rules); and second is the flight
which connects A and B flying under
IFR, (instrument flight rules).
Flights of VFR type are under tower
control at the airport only until they are
off the runway and climbing out to their
cruising altitude. Along the route from
A to B they are on their own. They
must abide by certain rules, (such as not
flying through cloud formations), which
are rather obvious from the fact that they
are flying under visual rules and must
be able to see and be seen by other
aircraft. However, their route is basically
up to their pilot's desires. When they
arrive over airport B they contact the
tower and receive permission to land, do
so by getting into a standard traffic pat-
tern for the airport and particular run-
way, make their aproach, landing, and
taxi clear of the runway primarily under
the safety of what the pilot can see
around him in the air and on the ground.
Flights of the IFR type are continu-
ously under some control by ground-
stationed air controllers. The IFR flight
is planned and controlled from its taxi
for take-off until its last taxi on the final
destination runway. Similar procedures
at airport A are followed until the air-
craft is climbing out to cruising altitude.
This altitude has been pre-assigned.
Under IFR the pilot calls the air con-
troller during his climb-out, and is
turned over to ATC (Air Traffic Con-
trol), by the tower. ATC gives the pilot
information all along the route and vice
versa. The altitude and route of the
flight may be changed for the benefit
of the passengers. Depending on the
length of the flight and the pilot will
check in with a number of ATC stations

This sleek new DC-8 exemplifies progress in making our passenger aircraft both safer and faster. Costing $5,000,000, the

enroute. ATC will know of other air-
craft in his vicinity which are under IFR
(instrument flight rule) and can keep
the pilot informed. But with present
equipment ATC may not know of the
presence of a VFR (visual flight rule)
flight.
If the ATC has continuous chains of
surveillance radar enroute they can keep
the pilot under positive control, and
keep him informed of non-IFR aircraft
in his area, (within the performance
limits of such surveillance radar). Upon
arriving at airport B the pilot shifts
again to the tower and is positioned for
the most efficient landing possible, in
terms of other aircraft desiring to land,
by the air controller at the tower. Often
in the case of commercial aircraft, usually
so configured, the landing will be made
under ILS, (Instrument Landing System).
Old Congestion
In the past ten years there have been
approximately one hundred and fifty
mid-air collisions, and only two of these
occurred under IFR conditions. But the
immediately-suggested solution of put-
ting all flights on IFR is just as quickly
seen to be no solution because of the
great number of aircraft which are not
equipped for IFR, the great number of
pilots not trained for IFR, and the fact
that at present the load on the CAA's
air controllers is so great that the system
would break down if it had to handle
all the flights which occur daily under
both IFR and VFR. Currently the CAA
handles about 17,000 IFR flights a day,
while there are aproximately 200,000
VFR flights each day.
Besides these two types of flight
there appear two main areas of con-
gestion in our airspace. The airspace
over airports A and B is one problem,
while the airspace between airports A
and B presents a different problem.
Again, each problem is one of separation.
No matter how well separated the
aircraft are kept enroute from A to B,
their paths must converge at the end-
points, so special rules and procedures
exist for marshalling their take-off times
and landing times. This special problem
of landing at B is not unrelated to the
flight from A to B in that separation
distance in "minutes of flight time"
must be properly kept between aircraft
by ATC in order to feed the terminal
B with aircraft at a reasonable rate. Con-
versely there is a maximum rate which
the tower at B can land and clear air-
craft.
Generally the flights are kept at ten
minutes flight time separation in each
airlane, and the tower is usually doing
well to land forty to fifty aircraft per
hour. Suppose the distance between A
and B is 500 miles, and that the air-
craft are capable of only 300 mph. A
ten minute separation means that 50
miles will be necessary between aircraft.
Further, assume ten available altitudes
at which to place aircraft between A
and B with the necessary separation for
safety. This gives us a maximum of 100
aircraft in the air between A and B
when they are what would be "bumper-
to-bumper" for automobiles between A
and B. Thus congestions in airspace is
an entirely different thing from conges-
tion on land.
VFR-IFR Mixed

AUTOMATION
With automation rapidly becoming a reality,
unions are evaluating their attitudes toward
this technological change.
by JOE EDWARDS, '58E
One of the current topics of major
interest is automation. Unions
have taken a particular interest in auto-
mation; to a union automation is any
technological change that affects union
membership. Union policies directed
toward automation range from outright
obstruction through competition and
control to concessions and co-operation.
The factors which influence a union in
determining what policy it will adopt in
response to automation are numerous and
varied.
What does labor want from automa-
tion? Labor itself has supplied the an-
swer, "more." This means more wages,
more leisure, and better working condi-
tions, but to a large extent it means
more security of employment and in-
come. Characteristic of most labor
leaders, Carl Huhndorff says, "Essentially
our function is both to protect and im-
prove the conditions of employment of
those we represent." In our rapidly
changing economy, security is often hard
to obtain, since technological changes
result in changing jobs and job require-
ments, which threaten employment op-
portunities, as well as the worker's in-
come and status. Some technological
changes bring greater work burdens, in-
creased nervous strain or greater health
and safety hazards. The union's wage
standards in an industry may be under-
mined if there is a large amount of
technological unemployment in the in-
dustry. Protection of its membership
from these adverse effects of techno-
logical change is a major union objective.
Since the function of a union is to
represent the views of its membership, a
union's outlook is necessarily a narrow
one. Unions are generally concerned
with their own best interests and not
with what is good in the long run for
labor or society as a whole. Most labor
leaders take the view that technological
advance is acceptable as long as labor is
taken care of and is able to share in the
gains. Although resistance to labor-sav-
ing changes does occur, it is usually mo-
tivated by good, old-fashioned, free
enterprise, free-interest, and is usually
carried out through economic pressure
on the employer.
What determines whether a union re-
sists or accepts a labor-saving change?
There are psychological factors that in-
fluence union policy. Fear of any kind
of unemployment is strongly fixed in the
minds of many workers today. This is
largely due to the depression experience
of the 1930's. Towards technological
unemployment workers feel a special
injustice, in that while they suffer un-
employment and loss in income, others
gain in the form of lower prices or in-
creased profits. In addition, the fact that
it is their own employers and not an
impersonal, uncontrollable change in
demand for the goods they produce, may
bring about worker resentment against
the employer, and a feeling that they can
do something to prevent displacement.
Thus, resistance is a natural first re-
action to technological changes that
promise to bring unemployment. Past
experience with technological changes
strongly influences workers' attitudes to-
wards these changes. For example, in
1945 the musicians feared that ". . . the
disastrous unemployment which had oc-
curred in the theaters after the introduc-
tion of sound films would be repeated
with the development of television."
and at first refused to co-operate with
the introduction of TV. On the other
hand, a favorable past experience with
technological changes leads to a greater
willingness to accept new techniques.
In addition to fear of technological
unemployment, there is an underlying
hostility to any change in the way things
are done. This is an aspect of human
nature which is understandably more
pronounced in older, skilled workers
who are less able or willing to adjust
to a new job. Instances have been found
in which ". . . the workers themselves
showed reluctance to accept jobs at ma-
chines or changed methods, even in
industries where technological changes

provided ample opportunity for work at
wage levels comparable to those received
at former operations." When work-
ers have been accustomed to a certain
way of production for a long time,
opposition tends to be greater. Skilled
workers often show great pride in the
quality of their work and resent what
may or may not be the inferior quality
of the machine-made product.
Union politics and organization also
affect the union's choice of policy. If
older workers control the union, there
is the greater likelihood of obstruction
than if younger workers are in power.
This is because older workers stand to
lose more by displacement, and are due
to retire sooner. By obstructing, they
may be able to maintain their employ-
ment at high wages until they retire.
A craft union is usually composed of
workers having a certain skill; any
change that will eliminate or decrease
the demand for this skill represents a
severe loss in employment, income, and
status for all the members of the craft
union. On the other hand, industrial
unions are composed of semi-skilled and
unskilled workers who are employed on
many parts of the productive process.
A labor-saving device is less likely to
affect the entire membership; those who
are displaced are readily able to find new
employment while suffering smaller cuts

in wages. Thus, since a craft union feels
the effects of technological change more
than an industrial union, a craft union
is more likely to vigorously resist a
change than an industrial union.
At times labor leaders, and more often
the workers, are slow to realize the im-
plications of a technological change and
formulate a policy too late to be effective
or stick to a poor policy too long.
National leaders are more concerned
than the local leaders with preserving
the union as an institution, and this
broader, long range view tends to favor
acceptance of technical progress. The
local leadership is subject to more pres-
sure from the workers whose immediate
concern for jobs results in a local ten-
dency to resist change. A typical ex-
ample of a national union's views is this
statement by President Weber of the
American Federation of Musicians,
". . . nothing will destroy the useful-
ness of an organization surer than to
set its face against progress no matter
how unfavorable we may at present con-
sider same to our interests."
The nature of the particular technical
change also helps to determine union
policy. Not only are some changes more
labor saving than others, but also some
may require a different type of labor.
The greater the number of union mem-
bers displaced, the greater is the likeli-
hood of obstruction. But if the old skill
can be used on the new method, the
union workers stand a better chance of
preventing displacement. For example,
the Typographical Union was aided in
its policy towards the introduction of the
linotype by the fact that the hand com-
positor's experience and skill made him
vastly superior to an unskilled worker
on the linotype.
If the old skill is a handicap on the
new job, or if the new job comes under
the jurisdiction of another union, the
union concerned is likely to obstruct the
change. If the labor-saving device means
less burden, strain or hazard on the job,
the device will be more readily accepted
than one whose effects are the opposite.
The way in which a new technique is
introduced influences union policy. If
given prior notice and information of
the change, and if the change is intro-
duced slowly enough for the workers to
adjust, the union is usually willing to
accept. "The . . . AFL-CIO welcomes
the age of automation ... It asks only
that workers be consulted about impend-
ing changes and dislocations, that shocks
be cushioned and that gains be equitably
shared. I concede, in other words, that
automation can be a blessing to everybody
'if we go about it in the right way.'"

dustry and in the nation also affects
union policy. When jobs are plentiful
there is less fear that technological
change will result in prolonged em-
ployment, and there is a greater willing-
ness on the part of the union to accept
labor-saving devices.
The economic position of the firm or
industry affects the worker's attitude to-
ward a particular change. There has
been some evidence that workers felt
large prosperous firms did not pass on
savings in costs to consumers, and there-
fore unions were justified in obstructing
the change.
Union policies have attempted to cope
with the problem of technological unem-
ployment by obstructing, competing with,
controlling, and sometimes co-operating
with the introduction of labor-saving
techniques.8 They may not be revealed
by official statements of national union
officers or by collective bargaining agree-
ments; for not only may national control
over the locals be weak, but also a union
may keep a restrictive clause in the con-
tract as a protective measure in case of
future unemployment.
The policy of obstruction aims at pre-
venting the introduction or use of a new
technique. Some of the conditions con-
ducive to a policy of obstruction are: a
technological change that threatens a
severe loss of employment and income,
poor relations with the employer, a large
amount of unemployment in the industry
and the nation, unhealthy or hazardous
workinig conditions on the new jobs, and
weak national control of the local unions.
Methods of obstruction are varied.
During the nineteenth century workers
sometimes turned to the destruction of
machines or threatened their inventors.
Today obstruction is carried out through
non-violent economic pressure. Most
often the union obstructs by prohibiting
its members from using the technique,
and/or threatening the employer with a
strike if he introduces the new device.
The union is sometimes able to get re-
strictions written into the collective bar-
gaining agreement.
Obstruction can also take the form of
union encouragement of a slow down
or restriction of output on the new ma-
chine. The union may try to prevent
the introduction by making the cost pro-
hibitive. By demanding higher wages or
the employment of unnecessary men, the
union can eliminate any savings in cost
the new technique would bring.
Sometimes unions have used legisla-
tion and building codes to obstruct a
new device. The Amalgamated Associ-
ation of Street Railway Employees in its
fight against the one-man street car tried
and succeeded in some cities to outlaw
the one-man car; it justified this action
by claiming the new car was unsafe and
encouraged robberies. The building
trades unions have attempted to prevent
the use of new labor-saving materials
through the enactment of unnecessarily
restrictive building codes. In 1952,
several cities had restrictive codes that
outlawed the use of new materials in
plumbing, electrical wiring, and the use
of brick and plaster substitutes.
The results of this policy have been
successful in some cases and failure in
others. The sucessful prohibition of a
highly labor-saving change for a number
of years requires a very strong economic
position, a lack of competition from
substitute goods, complete control over
the supply of labor, and a small but
crucial part of production. The fact that
the paint spray gun has been severely
restricted for over twenty-five years is
evidence that obstruction has been suc-
cessful for some unions.
The policy of competition is simply
an attempt to make the old method as
cheap as the new machine method. By
decreasing its wage rate the union hopes
to eliminate the cost superiority of auto-
mation, thereby preventing its introduc-
tion and maintaining jobs for the union's
labor. In addition to wage cuts the union
can make cost-reducing concessions in
the form of relaxed working rules. For
example, the glass bottle blower's union
gave up its usual summer layoff and
ran three shifts instead of two in a vain
effort to compete with the Owens auto-
matic machine.
The policy of competition has never
been completely successful in preventing
the introduction of labor-saving devices.
Generally competition spurs improve-
ments in the old machine, and the in-
creasing cost superiority over the old
method means that eventually the wage
cuts necessary to keep the machines out
are impossible to make. The union must
then face complete displacement of its
workers or change its policy. However,
competition may have slowed down the
rate of introduction of the new device
and prevented suffering on the part of
the workers. If the rate of introduction
can be slowed so that labor is displaced
no faster than the rate of attrition, the
union has achieved considerable success.
But unless the union is willing to sink
into oblivion along with the obsolescent
skill, it must change its policy to that of
control, i.e., accepting the machine but
gaining control over the new jobs.
For many unions the result of the
policy of control has been much more
favorable than either competition or ob-
struction. Through control the unions
have often made the best of some highly
labor-saving changes. This policy does
border on obstruction at times, and the
union, in gaining concessions, has to
watch out for the possibility of non-
union competitors taking business away
from union firms. There is a limit to
the extra costs (higher wages, retraining,
extra men, G.A.W., etc.) that the union
can tack on to a firm in a highly com-
petitive industry and have it stay in busi-
ness. Control is more successful in times
of prosperity when employers are better
able to afford these extra costs.
A big problem arises when control
involves seniority transfers and "bump-
ing"; intra-union squabbles often result.
Automation offers a problem for the
policy of control, in that it seems to call
for fewer workers engaged directly in
production and more highly skilled tech-
nicians and engineers who are typically
harder to organize. Thus control, while
it may not prevent technological unem-
ployment, may do much to cushion the
impact of technological change, and give
the worker a greater amount of security
on his job.
Unions do not always fear techno-
logical changes and there are a number
of cases in which the union allowed the
introduction of labor-saving devices with-
out concessions in return, or actively
encouraged the use of labor-saving
methods of production. This is the
policy of co-operation. It is most often
followed when employment is high and
the industry is expanding. The union
may also co-operate on the introduction
of a device that makes work easier,
healthier or safer. The union may be
in a weak bargaining position, and there-
fore forced to 'co-operate.' Go-operation
in labor-saving changes more often comes
about by the union simply allowing the
device to be introduced.
When a review is made of the many
factors affecting union policy, one sees
that union policy varies among the dif-
ferent national unions, among the locals
within a national union, from one tech-
nological change to another, and from
time to time. These many variable fac-
tors mean that few, if any, generaliza-
tions can be made about union policy
towards automation.

. . J7act ot 7iction?
No longer a subject for science-fiction, the
field of anti-physics has at last been placed on
firm ground.
by ROGER BARNES, '61E
On the day of August 2, 1932, man
made his first encounter with a
startling new positively-charged particle
which definitely was not the familiar
proton. In fact, it corresponded almost
exactly to the electron in every way ex-
cept its charge. Though it appeared to
Dr. Carl Anderson on that day as a thin
track in a cosmic ray photograph, its
existence had been conceived in a more
philosophical sense many centuries ago.
It was Plato who had proposed that all
nature was symmetrical—that is, har-
monizing and in perfect balance. For
example, this proposal is the basis for
all the laws of dynamic-equilibrium
which state that for every action there
must be a reaction. This philosophy of
symmetry also suggested that for every
regular negatively-charged electron, there
also must exist its opposite—the new
positively-charged particle.
The discovery of the positive opposite
of the electron soon prompted scientists
to consider the possibility of the nega-
tive opposite of the proton. About
twenty years later, with the use of the
powerful Bevatron, this pre-conceived
particle was also found as well as an-
other which was believed to be the op-
posite of the suposedly uncharged neu-
tron! The next step was quite obviously
the search for these particles in their
natural states, both in our galaxy and
the universe in general. They likewise
hoped to find some new "atomic struc-
ture" having positive electrons orbiting
around a nucleus composed of negative
protons. Anti-matter was the melodra-
matic name given to these structures that
are symmetrically opposite to the matter
familiar to everyone, but none has yet
been found by scientists.
Anderson's Remarkable Positron
There are presently two theories on
the creation of these positive electrons,
or positrons. The first postulates that
the positrons are fundamental particles
within the nucleus of an atom. When
this nucleus is bombarded by cosmic rays
or gamma rays from radio-active sub-
stances, the positrons are released along
with many other minute particles. The
second and most generally accepted
theory on the creation of the positrons
is foretold in Einstein's Theory of Rela-
tivity. When cosmic rays and gamma
rays, which are forms of energy, strike
a nucleus, they are converted into matter
—the positrons.
Though Anderson of the California
Institute of Technology took succeeding
photographs of the positron after his
discovery, he preferred to merely report
his findings, expounding in them his
ideas on the subject and challenging
others to conduct further investigations.
Not only did he have insufficient equip-
ment necessary for the work, but he also
wished to continue with his research in
the cosmic ray field. Nevertheless, other
physicists did take up his challenge. In
fact, it was Dr. P. M. S. Blackett and
D. G. Occhialini at the Cavendish labora-
tory in Cambridge, England that shortly
thereafter verified Anderson's discovery.
Five hundred photographs were taken of
particles resulting from the bombard-
ment of copper with cosmic radiation of
100 to 300 million electron volts.
Experimentation at the Cavendish
Laboratory indicated that Anderson's first
positrons were created from cosmic rays
which he had fired at the nuclei of atoms.
Moreover, it seemed that the positron
always occurred paired with a regular
electron — further evidence of Plato's
symmetry. The reason that positrons and
electrons don't exist in equal numbers is
that when they collide with one another,
both particles are annihilated, returning
back into energy. This fact seems to
substantiate the theory on the creation
of positrons by the conversion of energy
into matter best.
Anti-Protons Make Their Appearance
Soon after that memorable day in
1932, physicist began a search for a
possible negative proton. Although the
particles had been reported many times,
all of the cases appeared doubtful until
1951. It was in that year that Dr. J. G.
Retallack of Indiana University observed

tracks on a cosmic ray photograph and
was convinced that they were caused by
the negative proton, called the anti-
proton. Again three years later, similar
evidences were reported by Dr. Bruno
Rossi of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. Later in 1954, an even
more convincing photograph of a tre-
mendous outburst of cosmic energy was
taken at 100,000 feet altitude. Accord-
ing to Professor Marcel Schein of the
University of Chicago, who obtained the
extraordinary photograph, the ten mil-
lion billion electron volts of energy re-
sulted from a collision of anti-protons
with protons and their subsequent anni-
hilation.
However, the rarity of anti-protons in
cosmic radiation made it impossible to
accurately measure and investigate them
at any time and under the conditions
suitable to the researcher. It was far
more practical to creat them artificially
in the laboratory using a particle accel-
erator, but none was powerful enough
at that time. It wasn't until the giant
Bevatron was constructed at the Uni-
versity of California that anti-protons
could be created out of energy in fair
quantities.
The creation was accomplished by fir-
ing regular protons into the Bevatron
with energies of 6.2 billion electron
volts. When one of them struck a neu-
tron, about a billion electron volts was
converted into two new particles—the
anti-proton and a regular proton. Know-
ing precisely its character, four physicists
were able to isolate the anti-protons from
all other particles. First, all negatively-
charged particles were separated after
they automatically were repelled from
the magnet of the instrument. Secondly,
those negatives that had a mass the same
as a proton were found by measuring
the momentum and velocity. Momentum
was calculated knowing the curvature of
the particle beam in two magnetic fields;
velocity was found simply by timing the
particles between two counters.
Using this procedure, anti-protons
were first observed on September 1,
1955, and the discovery was announced
by Dr. Ernest O. Lawrence after bom-
bardments on October 17.
When anti-protons collide with pro-
tons, the energy appears first in the form
of mesons which decay very quickly.
Ultimately the carriers of the energy are
neutrinos, gamma rays, very high speed
electrons, and positrons.
Another Anti-Particle
In the course of research with anti-
protons, Dr. Emilio Segre, one of the
negative protons original discoverers at
the University of California, found evi-
dence of still another particle which was
symmetrical to the neutron. Ordinary
neutrons are found in the nuclei of atoms
without any charge and with the same
mass as the proton. This new particle,
the anti-neutron, has the same mass and
is without a charge, but has different
magnetic properties than its counterpart.
The anti-neutron had actually been de-
tected electronically for some time, but
in April of 1958, the first photograph
was made using a liquid propane filled
bubble chamber. In such a chamber, the
liquid propane is at a temperature just
below the boiling point. When a par-
ticle passes through, it leaves a trail of
tiny bubbles caused by the bubbling
liquid.
In Dr. Segre s instrument, anti-protons
were fired at ordinary atoms. Normally
the two particles would just annihilate
each other and turn into energy. These
bundles of energy would in turn leave
tracks on a bubble chamber photograph.
However, this time, the two particles
collided and changed, not into energy,
but into a neutron and the new anti-
neutron. Since neither has any charge,
they left no tracks on the photograph.
Nevertheless, a few inches away from
the point of collision on the picture,
both were annihilated since one is anti-
matter and the other is just ordinary
matter. Is is for this reason that Dr.
Segre maintains that the anti-neutron
does exist. Since energy couldn't have
caused the second annihilation it must
have been a particle of anti-matter, and
this particle must have been the anti-
neutron because it didn't leave a bubble
trail like any other might do.
Anti-Matter in the Milky Way
After each of the above anti-particles
had been created artificially, physicists
hoped to prove that they existed naturally
somewhere. If so, the existence of anti-
matter, the symmetrical opposite of the
familiar matter composed of atoms with
positive protons and negative electrons,
could be verified.
Was it possible that anti-matter could
be found on the earth or on other planets
and stars? No, since the anti-matter
would be annihilated instantly. Else-
where in our galaxy, the Milky Way,
the prospect of finding some seemed
better. First it must be assumed that
the gas in interstellar space is made up
of ordinary hydrogen atoms and some
anti-protons. Of the energy that would
be produced when the anti-protons col-

lided with the hydrogen protons, only
about 10% would be kept within the
galaxy by a very weak magnetic field.
Gradually this would be absorbed by the
surrounding atoms, creating turbulence
within the heated gas. Though highly
turbulent gas clouds are present in inter-
stellar space, they are also caused by
other means. Nevertheless, in order to
obtain some maximum figure of the
amount of anti-matter present in the
galaxy, the turbulence will be assumed
to be caused only by the energy given
off after a proton and anti-proton col-
lision. Since it is known that the total
energy of the gas clouds in the galaxy
is about one 100 billionth of an erg per
cublic centimeter, the ratio of anti-matter
to matter is found to be about one part
in ten million.
The chances that an entire star com-
posed of anti-matter are quite low if
this ratio holds true. However, it is spec-
ulated that some gigantic meteors that
have struck the earth in the past century
were made up of anti-matter. The me-
teor did leave a crater but no remains
were ever found. Certainly this would
be the case if matter and anti-matter had
annihilated each other when the meteor
struck the earth.
The discovery of mysterious radio
waves coming from certain parts of the
galaxy prompted the idea that perhaps
this radiation was also caused by an
annihilation. For example, the remnants
of the supernova, the Crab Nebula, are
thought to be emitting radiation consist-
ing of electrons and positrons accelerated
to high speeds by the magnetic field of
the nebula. If this is true, the radio
waves that are picked up by powerful
radio telescopes could be attributed to
energy given off when matter and anti-
matter collided. By using the ratio of
one part in ten million, the amount of
radiation was calculated to be remark-
ably close to the actual radio output
found by other means—10 23 ergs per
second.
There are also a great many other
sources of radio "broadcasts" in the sky
which have an output equal to what
would be expected if matter and anti-
matter had collided. One such source
is Cygnus A, which is two galaxies in
collision. This instance naturally raises
the question as to whether or not entire
galaxies other than our own are com-
posed of anti-matter.
Laws of Symmetry Are Violated
Recalling Plato's proposal, however, a
basic fault in the estimate of one part
of anti-matter in every ten million parts
of ordinary matter is easily recognized.
The treasured laws of symmetry are vio-
lated since matter and anti-matter aren't
existing in equal amounts. How then
can this apparent oversight be explained?
Another universe, completely isolated
and invisible from our own and yet com-
posed entirely of anti-matter. Though
it is only a philosophical argument, it
actually is the only one proposed that
seems to resolve the question. Its sup-
porters believe that when the universe
began expanding, matter became sepa-
rated from anti-matter.
The point that is most debatable is
how this separation took place for it
would seem that some sort of repelling

proton inside a liquid propane-filled
bubble chamber. This phenomenon was
recorded by Dr. Emilio Segre and Dr.
Wilson M. Powell, both of the Univer-
sity of California.

force was needed. Anti-gravity has been
proposed but since this force is not ac-
counted for in the Theory of Relativity,
most physicists are cautious to attempt
a drastic modification of the new ac-
cepted theory. According to Dr. Segre
at the University of California, there
probably exists some other force that
was responsible for the segregation of
matter and anti-matter.
Anti-matter itself has no practical
value to people on the earth because
it will destroy itself immediately when
it touches our matter. Its real value to
physicists today is that anti-matter may
be the answer they wanted to clarify
the formation of our universe. More-
over, it will probably set the laws of
physics and cosmology on a much firmer
foundation. But an even greater service
that anti-matter has rendered was to give
definite proof of the laws of symmetry
that Plato had first proposed many cen-
turies ago.

ACTIVITIES
Edited by BARRY PEEBLES, '60E
For both new and old students numer-
ous activities in the College of Engi-
neering provide an opportunity for the
up-coming engineer to broaden himself
both technically and socially. The dif-
ferent types of activities range all the way
from the class governing boards to the
technical groups to the honorary societies.
No matter what a student's interests
may be he is bound to find something
that meets his desires and needs. To
help you, the reader, discover which
organizations you might be interested in
participating in, the Technic presents a
short sketch about each of the groups
in the following paragraphs.
The Engineering Council
The Engineering Council is the co-
ordinating body of the College of Engi-
neering. Its membership consists of
members at large who are appointed by a
committee of the Council, the represen-
tatives of all technical societies, the edi-
tors of the MICHIGAN TECHNIC and
the ARCH, the president of the Engi-
neering Honor Council, the presidents
of the four Engineering Classes, and Tau
Beta Pi. Several other organizations such
as Triangles Honorary, Vulcans Honor-
ary, Pi Tau Sigma, etc. The Council has
three faculty advisors, Professors Buning,
Cadell, and Benford.
The Council plans to sponsor a faculty
evaluation, a dance (Playboy's Prance),
a plaque for the late Dean George
Granger Brown, the Engineering Open
House held for the benefit of residents
of the local area and prospective stu-
dents. The Council is planning a new
and coordinated effort in public relations
for the Technical societies. It also will
create a committee to study and make
recommendations to the various societies
on how they can more effectively serve
their purposes and increase membership.
Through these efforts the Council intends
to stimulate among other things a better
knowledge of industry, engineering as
a profession, and further professional
registration.
If you are interested in partaking of
Engineering Council projects, please con-
tact any of the Faculty advisors or J. C.
Boehringer, President.
Executive Boards
The Executive Boards are the elected
governing and administrative bodies of
the freshmen, sophomore, and junior
classes in the College of Engineering.
Mainly the Boards organize and sponsor
such activities and projects that will bene-
fit their class. In addition the Boards
act as a liason body between the students
and the administration.
The Executive Board of the Class of
1960E (Juniors) met late last spring to
lay the groundwork for this falls activi-
ties. A number of ideas were discussed
including the possible establishment of a
"Master Engineering Exam File" by the
Board. The group is considering several
ideas to raise money, some of which
would be donated to the Dean George
Granger Brown Memorial Plaque Fund.
The officers for the year are: Barry
Peebles, President; Fred Hornbacher,
Vice-President; and John Lutz, Sec-
Treas.
The Sophomore Board is also busy
working out their plans for this year.
Included in them are an early fall picnic
or get-together at the Island Park and a
Cinema Guild movie sponsorship. Dur-
ing their freshman year this class were
the victors over the Class of 1960E in
the annual Frosh-Soph Tug-o-War. As
"defending champs" this year they are
looking forward to dry feet again this
year.
The officers for this year are: John
Mertus, President; John Cothorn, Vice-
President; and Bill Sanders, Sec.-Treas.
Honor Council
The Engineering Honor Council, ad-
ministrators of the Honor Code, has two
main responsibilities — educational and
judicial.
Concerning the educational responsi-
bility, it is the duty of the Honor Council
to see that the engineer is made aware
of the many benefits of the Honor Code
and that he understands the mechanics
of its operation. Along this line the
Honor Council is planning an extensive
"educational" program this fall, includ-
ing the erection of a bulletin board in
the new Student-Faculty Lounge which
will illustrate in detail the benefits of the
Code.
Judicial duties require that the Council
hear cases of reported violations of the
Honor Code, decide on the merits of
the case, and levy a penalty if the student
is guilty.
The Honor Council is made up of
eight voting members, an alternate mem-
ber, and a non-voting ex-officio repre-
34
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


members and an alternate are chosen each
semester.
The officers for the Fall semester are
Dave Schultz, President, and Bob Chap-
man, Secretary.
Technic
The Technic is the oldest engineering
college magazine in America, being en-
tered as second-class matter in 1882.
Though old and wise, the Technic is
always in need of fresh ideas and new
blood. There is plenty of room for new-
comers.
Many students think that they have
to be a Sinclair Lewis or a Shakespeare
to be on the staff. Actually, although
good writers are always needed, there
are many jobs on the staff which require
completely different types of talent. To
mention a few, there are advertising, cir-
culation, and illustration. No matter
what you're good at, there's room for
you at the Technic.
The little time that staffers spend each
week is well spent as you get much
valuable experience on how to put a
magazine out, how to twist an article
out of a professor, and how to run a
business. Then of course, there is the
big steak dinner at the end of the year.

Scrubbing the Engine Arch immaculate is the immediate
task of these Triangles neophytes. Tapped in the sophomore
year for this junior men's engineering honorary, the mem-
bers have been chosen for outstanding campus contributions.
Vulcans
Vulcans, founded in 1904, is the
senior engineering honor society which
taps students for outstanding achieve-
ment in extracurricular activities. Each
spring the Vulcans come forth from their
den in the Union Tower to tap worthy

These oil-and-lampblack-covered Vulcans neophytes are pictured going through
the rigors of initiation. Once active members of this senior men's engi-
neering honorary, they will take part in the Vulcans program
of service to the campus community.
junior engineers with oil and lamp black.
A service group as well as an honorary
Vulcans regularly do charitable work in
nearby hospitals and at times provide
financial support for several student
groups. Vulcans have also set up a
scholarship to aid a worthy student.
Tau Beta Pi
One of the highest honors an engi-
neering student can receive is to be
tapped for Tau Beta Pi, whose members
are chosen for distinguished scholarship
and exemplary character. Beyond this,
Tau Beta Pi is also a service organization
with responsibilities to the school and
the community.
Tau Beta Pi is well-known for the
high-quality type of program presented
at semi-monthly meetings. Many men
from business and industry highlight
these meetings as well as discussions and
other informative programs.
They also have quite an extensive
social calendar including two banquets,
a weekend at a nearby lake, and other
social functions.
Triangles
Triangles, the junior engineering hon-
orary, was founded in 1917 for the
recognition of outstanding achievement
in extra-curricular activities and athletics.
Composed of 12 men who are tapped
in May of their sophomore year, Tri-
angles main purpose is to promote in-
terest in and cooperation between activi-

SPOTLIGHTS
PROGRESS
Compiled by MIKE MAUNOWSKI, '61E
Formal education is continuing again
after its temporary three-month halt.
However, science, with its experiments
and innovations, saw no seasonal stop
or even a slowdown. Warm weather in-
stead acted as a catalyst for the count-
less projects that have been developing
in the minds of the scientists throughout
the winter months. Aviation again is in
the news with new fuels and guidance
systems. Progress is being made on auto
exhaust control. There is a new source
of portable power derived from a com-
pact alkaline cell. Besides these, there
is an interesting release concerning the
atmosphere surrounding our solar neigh-
bor, Mars. We will cover these in the
October edition of "Spotlights" for the
new school year.
High Energy
Aviation Fuels
Powerful new aviation fuels to deliver
longer range with smaller fuel loads will
soon be in use in civilian and military
aircraft according to a report delivered
in Dallas today. Several types of fuel
are now in production and others are
being considered and tested.
R. A. Wells, staff engineer for the
Gulf Research and Development Com-
pany, in a paper outlining the new types
of fuel, noted that they cover the whole
range of aircraft from conventional pis-
ton engines to liquid-fueled rockets.
A new high-energy gasoline additive,
now in production, will give piston en-
gines more power per gallon, thereby
enabling commercial flights to increase
either their paying cargo or their flying
range. Despite a higher cost for the
fuel, Mr. Wells said airlines should
realize a net saving in operating cost of
approximately 3%, not even taking ac-
count of anticipated savings in engine
overhaul cost.
For jet engines pyrophoric fuels
(liquids that ignite spontaneously in air)
seems to produce much better overall
results than any other type tested so far.
Three types of pyrophoric fuels under
examination are triethyl aluminum
(TEA), triethyl boron (TEB), and tri-
methyl aluminum (TMA). They can
be produced in large volume at reason-
able prices, said Mr. Wells, and permit
the same amount of thrust to be taken
from a smaller, less complicated and
more reliable engine than do other fuels.
A ram-jet engine that burns pyrophoric
fuel has been designed for constant alti-
tude target drone or missile application.
It weighs only 18 pounds and can de-
velop a velocity one and a half times
greater than the speed of sound. A $600
engine is possible compared with a price
of up to $10,000 for a similar unit using
conventional fuels.
Another advantage of pyrophoric fuels
is that they virtually eliminate "flame-
out," a condition in which the jet engine
goes out in thin air, forcing the pilot
to drop to denser air to relight the jets.
Mr. Wells also said that small amounts
of these fuels added to hydro-carbon
fuels have been found to improve burn-
ing, reduce screech in rockets and allow
more reliable operation at higher alti-
tudes.
Sadly enough for proponents of their
use, said the engineer, pyrophoric fuels
have some unfortunate characteristics.
TEA and TEB are extremely destructive
to living tissue and cause deep burns and
scarring. They ignite spontaneously if
accidentally exposed to air and react
violently or even explode in contact with
water and hydrogen compounds. Mr.
Wells indicated that packaging these
fuels could eliminate many problems, but
that the Navy has not looked kindly on
materials that react with water.
The most widely-publicized of all the
high energy fuel programs was started
in 1952 by the Navy, joined by the Air
Force in 1955 and resulted in a major
fuel technology breakthrough in the
form of a new series of hydrogen-carbon-
boron compounds retaining much of the
high energy of borons but with more
stability and less toxicity. Boron hy-
drides, as they are called, have a high
reactivity, which means that an aircraft
can fly higher with less danger of flame-
out.
Although boron hydrides are 50 times
more expensive than petroleum-type
fuels, they might be used economically
enough in some military planes, espe-
cially long-range bombers. These planes
require servicing en route to a distant
target. By removing the need for refuel-
ing, as these compounds might, it might
be possible to eliminate costly personnel
and equipment.

This new DC-8 makes a pretty picture as it is towed from
the factory to be shipped to United Airlines. One of 40
purchased by United, the DC-8 is driven by pyrophoric
fuels which are not only safer, but also more economical
for the heavier transport jet engines. (See also page 22).

Interchangeable Guidance
Systems for Mace
The United States Air Force TM-76
Mace is being test flown at Holloman
Air Force Base, New Mexico, to check
out its Inertial and ATRAN guidance
systems. The systems are fundamentally
interchangeable with only minor pro-
duction changes to the missile. The
ATRAN-guided Mace is designated the
TM-76A, -while the Inertial Mace is
known as the TM-76B. Results of "on-
range" flights and long range flights
from Holloman to Wendover Air Force
Base, Utah, have been termed highly
successful by Tactical Air Command and
Martin Company representatives.
During six ATRAN flights in a test
vehicle at altitudes below 1,000 feet, as
many as six jammers were employed to
simulate enemy counter measures. In no
case was the guidance system "confused"
and the vehicle continued on its course
with a high degree of accuracy. Jammers
were unable to prevent perfect ATRAN
tracking results at accuracies within a
few feet of course.
ATRAN, a map matching system de-
veloped by Goodyear Aircraft Corpora-
tion, divorces the Mace from any need
for ground control. Since it does not
depend on receiving electronic signals
from the ground, it is almost impossible
for an enemy to jam or confuse it. The
new guidance system relates a film strip,
actual or synthetic, to the terrain over
which the Mace is flying. If there is
any deviation from the programmed route,
the missile's flight is adjusted to rematch
the terrain with the film. ATRAN per-
mits the Mace to fly at extremely low
altitudes, thus complicating enemy radar
defenses. The effective range of the best
radar under development is extremely
small when used to detect low-flying
targets. The number of installations
needed to present a solid radar "fence"
around an enemy country would be
enormous. Further, a Mace must be
traced, not just "detected," before any
defensive steps can be taken. In addi-
tion, the Mace can be programmed to
vary its altitude during a given flight.
The Inertial guidance system gives the
Mace complete invulnerability to enemy
jamming. Not only does it eliminate
the need for ground control facilities,
but the system emits no radiation of any
type, preventing enemy electronic de-
tection. Highly accurate, Inertial guid-
ance permits the Mace to be flown over
any course including wide expanses of
water. No terrain check points are neces-
sary. The system compensates for changes
in wind, temperature and barometric
pressures, is not limited by foul weather
or unlimited climatic conditions.
The Mace can be programmed to fly
a variety of flight patterns to meet
specific tactical situations. The missile
can penetrate enemy territory at altitudes
over 40,000 feet or come in low at high
speed with pre-selected detours around
or over geographical obstacles and enemy
strongholds. Another typical flight pat-
tern is a combination of both the high
and the low . . . the high to increase
range, the low to avoid detection when
near a heavily guarded target. In addi-
tion to altitude changes, the Inertial sys-
tem can be pre-set to provide deviation
to either side of the missile course.
The Mace Inertial guidance system is
a form of "memory-navigation." This
means that the geographic position of
both launch point and target point must
be known and set into the system prior
to launch. The missile then "knows" the
exact distance to be travelled. Once
launched and streaking towards target,
the system is aware at any given instant
exactly how far it has travelled. It then
subtracts this distance from the "remem-
bered" total distance and knows pre-
cisely how far it is to target. This pro-
cess is constantly repeated until distance
to target becomes zero, and the Mace

EXPLORING THE NUCLEUS
Every student at the University is thoroughly familiar with
its primary function, that of pure and applied education.
Not as many students, however, have more than a remote
idea of the research undertaken as a routine matter by a
large University. The research program at Michigan is as
varied as it is vast. Encompassing the main campus and
North Campus in Ann Arbor, The Willow Run Laboratories,
and many installations scattered through the nation and
world, it is even more remarkable that an organization of
this size is so "behind-the-scenes" in its operation. Most
research (other than that of a medical nature) is carried on
by BOB RUSNAK, '60E
under the University of Michigan Research Institute, an
oganization now in its 39th year. In its history, Michigan
research has played an invaluable role in many scentific
and engineering developments (including the recent dis-
covery of the Salk polio vaccine). UMRI last year employed
770 students for its more than 400 projects, with an annual
budget over 11 million dollars.
Beginning with this issue (nuclear spectroscopy research),
The Technic will present each month a feature article on
engineering research at Michigan.
The basic goal of nuclear spectroscopy
is the evaluation and correlation of
the properties of nuclear matter in the
hope and with conviction that we will
one day obtain a more complete under-
standing of the structure and interaction
of nuclei. While the knowledge and tech-
niques of nuclear spectroscopy have
found research applications in such di-
verse fields as chemistry, medicine, ar-
chaeology, geology, engineering, agricul-
ture, etc., it should be remembered that
such applications, while useful in the
specific field of research, do not consti-
tute the ultimate goal for the nuclear
physicist.
History of Development
In many respects the development of
nuclear physics parallels the development
of atomic physics, and it should therefore
be of interest to review some of the high
points in the study of atomic structure.
The earliest indications of the discrete
or atomic nature of matter came from
quantitative investigations in the field of
chemistry. These investigations made
possible the assignment of average atomic
weights to the various elements, and, in
addition, they demonstrated a certain
periodicity in the chemical properties of
the elements. As a result of the rapid
advances in the techniques and instru-
mentation in the field of optical spectro-
scopy about a century ago, a deeper un-
derstanding was gained of interactions
which occur between the particles within
an atom. Many attempts, some of them
partially successful, were made to corre-
late the multitude of available data. It
should be recalled, however, that in these
early days of spectroscopy nothing was
known about the existence of such parti-
cles as the electron and neutron which,
as we know today, play an exceedingly
important role in determining the prop-
erties of the atom.
The first major break-through in
atomic physics came with the Bohr model,
first put forth half a century ago. Niels
Bohr, a Danish physicist, pictured the
atom as a solar system, with the main
mass of the atom being concentrated in
a central core, or nucleus, and with elec-
trons traveling in orbits about this cen-
tral core, the electrons being held in
orbit by electrostatic (Coulomb) forces.
Bohrs representation of the atom could
prove valid only if one applied to it
certain conditions, which appeared quite
arbitrary at that time. For example, not
all orbits were available to the electrons,
and only a specific maximum number of
electrons could occupy each of the al-
lowed orbits. When these conditions
were imposed upon the model, the great
majority of accumulated knowledge fell
into place, and hitherto unexplained
phenomena were clarified. Later devel-
opments, such as the wave nature of
matter, the exclusion principle, etc., led
to a better understanding of the original
restrictions of the model in terms of
more fundamental concepts. In addition,
several refinements, such as the discovery
of the spin of the electron, have brought
about a still better agreement between
the model and experimental facts.
The next logical question concerns the
nature of the nucleus and nuclear forces.
It is at this point that the story of nuclear
spectroscopy begins.
The early progress in the field of nu-
clear physics was slow and difficult. The
correctness of Bohr's assumption that the
tiny nucleus contains all the positive
charge of the atom and nearly all the
mass was verified by the careful scatter-
ing experiments of Sir Ernest Rutherford.
These scattering experiments also yielded
the approximate dimensions of the nu-
cleus, about one one-hundred-thousandth
the radius of the atom. It was also
learned that some of the naturally occur-
ring atoms decay spontaneously with the
emission of certain particles of high

DEVELOPMENT CENTER...
Another Unmatched Engineering Facility to
Advance Propulsion Systems of the Future
Future aircraft and missiles may require propulsion
systems far different from those in wide use today
— different in size, power output, appearance, and
perhaps even in the basic method of utilizing energy.
To probe the propulsion future . . . and to build
and test greatly advanced propulsion systems for
coming generations of flight vehicles, Pratt &amp;
Whitney Aircraft is now operating its new Florida
Research and Development Center. This facility
supplements Pratt &amp; Whitney's main research and
development installations in Connecticut.
The new Florida Center, financed and built by
Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, is unique in America's
air industry. Here a completely air-conditioned
plant with 17 acres under roof is specially designed
and equipped for the development of new power
plants of virtually any type. Testing is handled in
special isolated areas; the nearest is four miles
from the plant and many miles from any inhabited
area. The new Center can be greatly expanded on
its 10-square-mile site. Continued isolation is in-
sured by a vast wildlife sanctuary in which the
Center is located.
Of the many people employed at the Center to-
day, about half are scientists, engineers and highly
trained technicians. By late next year, the total
number is expected to be almost doubled.
The new Florida Research and Development
Center is one more reason why Pratt &amp; Whitney
Aircraft is able to continue producing the world's
best aircraft propulsion systems ... in whatever
form they take.

fashion, space must be continuous: it
must flow throughout the structure the
same way man moves through it. Space
must therefore be in motion, defining
the living space, not changing into areas
of empty uselessness.
American architecture today is a com-
promise between two schools. Gropius
and Mies Van der Rohe, though they
have not desired to include nature in
their work or even recognize its exist-
ence, are tending more towards the or-
ganic through greater space continuity.
They recognize the beauty in pure form,
in the delicately modeled glass and steel
facade, in the carefully modeled interior.
It is this subservience to the beauty of
pure form that restricts their movement
towards the organic.
Marcel Breuer adopts an attitude (an
outgrowth of the Bauhaus) that the very
nature of a building is that it is not an
organism, that it is not natural but a
product of machines and technology . His
emphasis is on the contrast between
homes and natural growth, not on the
similarity. Yet his materials are organic,
and his best work has been done with
wood.
Skidmore, Owings and Merrill have
tended toward the rational. The Lever
Bros. Building was a great engineering
and architectural achievement. It sug-
gested the numerous possible uses of
glass and was in itself a carefully exe-
cuted design. However, the works that
have followed have been standard steel
and glass skyscrapers with little person-
ality or meaning of their own. If any-
thing they seem to testify to the anony-
mity of their designers and inhabitants.
The list of significant American archi-
tects could go on much further to include
Eero Saarinen, Louis Kahn, Edward
Stone, Harrison and Abramowitz, Wil-
liam Lescaze, Minoru Yamasaki and
many others.
We must not interpret the trend in
home building necessarily as an indica-
tion of our architectural success. The
turn of the century saw the birth of an
organic architecture yet the majority of
building done at the time was anything
but indigenous. The important work be-


Built in 1949, the First Unitarian Church in Madison, Wisconsin, surely possesses
radically different lines. The edifice is based upon the triangle (the symbol
of inspiration). Covering the singularly trussed roof is copper, and the
walls are of native limestone. Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.
ing done today is that of the architects
mentioned here and a few others. The
ordinary architect, as the mediocre
painter, tends to copy and imitate the
work of his superiors. It is all the differ-
erence between a work of art and a re-
hashing of current trends. In the last
twenty years many universities have re-
placed their outmoded neo-classic build-
ings with anonymous rectangular night-
mares. The neo-classic was outright eclec-
ticism but it asserted a sort of scholarly
dignity that suited its purpose. The new
buildings tend to express only their lack
of visual maturity.
The engineer as well as the architect
must remember that architecture stems
from a social purpose. It demonstrates
technological prowess but even more im-
portant, combines the social attitude of
a particular culture with a developed
visual sensitivity. It is a measure of our
maturity as individuals and at the same
time, as organized groups.
Some architects are able to develop
deep understanding of the psychological
needs of the public. Others have highly
sophisticated aesthetic sensibilities. Or-
ganic architecture tends, by its very na-
ture, to merge these two abilities whereas
purists or functionalists must always keep
the public in mind since social purpose
may so easily be ignored. The trend
towards the organic which, today, is
characteristic of building all over the
world, is therefore a trend toward the
psychological, physical, and aesthetic
needs of the people. The engineer, be-
ing directly or indirectly responsible for
the final structure, has an obligation to
the public at least to be aware of the
significance and value of each building.
Though at the sacrifice of form for
form's sake, progress in the direction of
the indigenous can hardly be discourag-
ing. The trend toward the organic can
only be interpreted as a trend toward
freedom of expression, toward a greater
understanding and appreciation for, hu-
man motivation.

It takes all kinds
of engineers to do
Western Electric's job
It is Western Electric's job in the Bell System to manufacture some 65,000 different
parts which are assembled into a vast variety of telephone apparatus and equipment.
This job, coupled with our other responsibilities as part of the System, requires the
assistance of engineers in every field.
Their skills and talents are needed to develop new manufacturing techniques, solve
quality control problems, determine machine and tool requirements, devise testing
facilities and methods. They work on new applications for metals and alloys, calculate
raw material needs, seek manufacturing cost reductions.
In helping meet the Bell System's need for more and better telephone equipment,
Western Electric engineers have assignments in the other areas of our job—installation,
distribution and purchasing.
Our engineers are also deeply involved in defense projects entrusted to us by the
government. Because of our specialized experience as part of the Bell System we are
well equipped to handle the job. Among these projects: the Nike guided missile system
and the White Alice communications network in Alaska.
Of course, Western Electric engineers are encouraged and assisted in developing
professionally... in expanding their technical know-how. Company-sponsored pro-
grams — like the full-time Graduate Engineering Training Program and the Tuition
Refund Plan-help them along.
Promotion from within—a Western Electric policy—helps many of our engineers
move into positions of prime responsibility. Today, 55% of the college graduates in our
upper levels of management have engineering degrees. In
the next ten years, 7,000 key jobs must be filled by newly
promoted people—engineers included.
Western Electric technical fields include mechanical,
electrical, chemical and civil engineering, plus the physi-
cal sciences. For more information pick up a copy of

LUNAR POWER PLANT
(Continued from page 21)
from carbon-bearing lunar materials, if
any should prove available.
Any technology of lunar exploitation
would be deeply affected by two prime
environmental factors radically different
than Earth's: the much lower gravity,
which would allow unheard-of perform-
ances from engines of limited power,
and the presence of almost perfect
vacuum. This latter will, for instance,
permit the smelting of metals without any
fear of oxidation. Before we decide the
technological processes required to use-
fully employ lunar materials, it is of
course necessary to obtain a good idea
of the lunar environment, and surface
and subsurface structure.
In any event, we can be certain that
whatever technologies will be evolved
will have as their prime requisite the
use of large quantities of electrical
powers. We thus need to develop light-
weight long-lasting power generators
particularly suited to the lunar environ-
ment.
Among the various prime sources of
power, the sun is one of the most im-
pressive, since at zenith it pours upon
the lunar surface something like 6,000
kilowatts per acre. Attempts to tap solar
power have been made with varying
degrees of success on our planet for over
half a century. Early systems trans-
formed the sun's energy into heat by
means of collecting mirrors, the heat then
being utilized to boil liquids and drive
conventional steam engines. In recent
years, photovoltain solar batteries have
come into existence as well as means of
transforming heat directly into electricity
without the intermediary of rotating ma-
chinery. All these devices suffer from

two drawbacks: fairly low efficiency, and
sizeable weights.
The phenomenon of photoelectricity
was discovered in 1887 by H. Hertz.
Not clearly understood until 1905, when
Albert Einstein gave the correct explana-
tion of the phenomenon and formulated
its theory, the photoelectric effect has
never been used for the generation of
power. One of the prinicple reasons
for this neglect is that photogeneration
requires a vacuum, which is generally
costly to achieve within the medium of
our atmosphere and which is subject to
destruction upon breakage of the vacuum
container. On the lunar surface, how-
ever, and in space generally, vacuum is
freely supplied by nature. Photoelectric
generation is thus a natural form of con-
version of solar energy to electrical
power.
The basic principle of photoelectric
conversion is simple: a light or radiation
quantum impinging upon a metallic
surface, will extract electrons if the
quantum is energy h (h = Planck's con-
testant, * — quantum's frequency) ex-
ceeds the "work function" of the sur-
face. The emitting surface is called the
photocathode: if facing this surface we
place a collecting device, which can take
the form, for instance, of a metallic grid,
the electrons emitted by the photocathode
will strike the collector photoanode and
generate a voltage; upon closing the
circuit between photoanode and photo-
cathode by means of a suitable load,
current can be drawn. The impinging
ight energy is thus converted directed
into electricity.
An obvious prerequisite for the gen-
eration of power is a low internal im-
pedance for the device. Photoelectric
cells which have been constructed in the
past had internal impedances of the
order of one megohm, and thus made
available only micropowers. Work now
being done is yielding cells with internal
impedances of about 3,000 ohms and,
even more important, has led to a more

intimate understanding of the photoelec-
tric parameters. Consequently mode ad-
vanced structures were developed which
promise in the near future internal im-
pedances of the order of 0.1 ohm, with
even lower values forseeable in the not
too distance future.
The next important consideration is
solar conversion efficiency. This depends,
among many other factors, on the work
function of the materials used, since
the higher the work function the shorter
the cutoff wavelength and therefore the
smaller the fraction of solar distribution
spectrum that will be usefully converted.
In Figure 4 are shown the work func-
tions of various materials and their maxi-
mum efficiencies of conversion of solar
energy. In early experiments efficiencies
of the order of 0.1% were achieved:
the insight gained into the phenomenon
now shows good promise of generators
with up to 25% conversion efficiency.
Achievement of this latter figure would
mean power yields of the order of 1,500
Kw/acre when the photosurface is ex-
posed to the sun at zenith.
The photosensitive material consists of
an extremely thin (order of 1 micron)
layer of metallic mixtures. This layer
can be coated on thin plastic sheets to
be stretched between appropriate supports
placed on the lunar surface. A thin
metallic collector grid is then placed
facing the photocathode and insulated
from it: the cell is now completed and
ready to generate electricity. In practice,
since the voltage generated by each such
cells is fairly low (order of a few volts),
several cells need to be connected in
series. This can be done quite easily by
insulated strips which separate the photo-
cathode into individual portions, and
connecting the portions in series. In this
fashion practically any voltage, includ-
ing of course 110 volts DC, is achieve-
able. Figure 5 gives a weight estimate
of an advanced photogenerator for lunar
use.
One of the chief advantages of this
device is its exceedingly long life: even
relatively large meteorites impinging
upon it would merely destroy a portion
of the photo-converting surface, with a
consequent relatively small reduction in
power output (directly proportional to
the area destroyed) but without disabling
the generator. To prevent meteorites
from accidentally severing the power
cables, these will be flat rather than
cylindrical: a meteorite would merely
punch a hole in the flat conductor with-
out severing it.
It should be noted that the power
yields quoted above are valid for the sun
at zenith. The rising and setting sun
would, of course, yield practically no
power while the sun at angles other than
zenith yields decreased power directly
proportional to the cosine of the angle
from the vertical. An orientable gen-
erator would alleviate this difficulty;
however, while this is feasible in the
case of photoelectric-equipped space
craft, it is not practical for the large
surface areas envisioned for the Moon.
In this case, the extremely light weight
of the generator allows for another solu-
tion, namely, making the generator's sur-
face larger to take into account the re-
duction factor caused by the sun's
obliqueness.

Exactly how important are resistor insulations?
In a sense, a resistor is simply a mechanical device for packaging ohms. So it is easy to see
why the materials making up the mechanical package greatly determine resistor perform-
ance. In fact, insulation is so important that more than one-third of the 200 technicians at
IRC are engaged in developing custom-tailored insulating coatings and housings for IRC
resistors. That's why every IRC resistor is better protected from damage and ambient con-
ditions than any other of its type. And at no extra cost.

U. S. AIRWAYS
are just beginning to be solved. Primary
among these conflicts is that the military
jet aircraft have been allowed to fly VFR
flights mixed with the commercial planes
under IFR conditions (Although the
mixing is potentially just as bad when
civilian VFR flights mix with commer-
cial IFR, the usual happening is that
with the coming of bad weather the
civilian small planes leave the air.)
Most of the trouble caused by military
aircraft of high performance type under
VFR when mixed in the same airspace
with commercial IFR is because the pilots
in this situation cannot alone execute
the necessary separation. The IFR com-
mercial pilot depends on ATC to tell
him what aircraft are in his airspace,
and ATC depends to a great extent on
what aircraft should be there. Even if
the ATC had constant radar surveillance
of its planes by a radar presentation at
the control station, (which it doesn't,
yet), there are limitations inherent in
the gear which make it very possible for
a military jet aircraft not to be noticed
by ATC until too late.
This is one of the things which hap-
pened in the Viscount-Maryland Na-
tional Guard T-33 collision May 20,
1958, where the jet was not noticed by
the controller until it was within 500
yards of the viscount. The reason for
this is that it takes a sensitive radar,
operating at peak performance (very
well 'in tune"), to detect even an occa-
sional blip return from the smooth skin
of a fast jet aircraft. The propeller and
the slower moving fuselage of a prop-
driven aircraft give a much better re-
turn. And because the controller is
watching several aircraft blips on his
scope, he may not notice an occasional
blip from a jet even if it happens to
be there.
Another reason that the mixture of
military jet VFR with any type of air-
craft is so dangerous is that the "see
and be seen" VFR rules break down
when the closing speeds are so high as
to cut the time for evasive action to
zero—even assuming the aircraft saw
each other, which is very unlikely if you
consider the difficulty of watching a
bullet. To press this point a bit fur-
(Continued from page 23)
ther, the closing speeds here are actually
much faster than a bullet. In practical
cases they can be supersonic. So, unless
the jet hits the other aircraft, no one
knows he was there.
The CAA, long cognizant of this
problem, had offered to give optional
IFR control to all flights over 24,000
feet, and immediately following the Vis-
count disaster this was put into effect as
mandatory for all non-tactical military
aircraft above 20,000 feet by an emer-
gency presidential order. The problem
here was again one of separation. This
time to be effective the ATC must have
known of all aircraft in a given airspace.
The order is useful, but raises the usual
problems of administration of any emer-
gency order, so it is necessary to find a
general standard solution.
New Congestion
Considering for a moment the conges-
tion problem as regards the likely in-
creases in future air traffic, it appears
that such experts as Presidential Advisor
Edward P. Curtis foretell of a peculiar
way air traffic will increase. While it is
true that more and more passenger
miles will be flown, this will not mean
an appreciable increase in the number of
commercial aircraft in the air. (The
fleet now numbers approximately 1,700.)
What will happen is that the aircraft

will get larger, carrying larger payloads
of 100 instead of 40, fly faster to 600
mph instead of 300, and make of neces-
sity more take-offs and landings. This
idea brings into focus the problem of
landings per hour that can be handled
by an airport.
At Willow Run, for example, they
are now handling five or six hundred
IFR operations per day. This number
can be handled by the present tower
personnel, equipment and field facilities
quite safely. But even now they are
under the necessity of so marshalling
their aircraft that, as one plane on the
runway has slowed sufficiently to turn
off onto the first cross-runway at about
mid-point, the next aircraft to land is
coming in over the edge of the just
vacated runway. This is necessary be-
cause the rate of 600 operations per day
means 2.4 minutes per operation, and
time must be saved for the possible
event of an aircraft missing the first
turn off place to clear the landing run-
way, and being required to continue to
the end of the runway. When this hap-
pens it forces the next aircraft in line
to land to go around again, so a little
time saved along the day's operations is
needed. Suppose the field is covered
with snow, often it is very difficult for
the pilot to distinguish between the grass
and the concrete, so he may well miss
the first turn off. The installation of
better lighting has helped the situation,
but it still exists.
Airport Facilities Needed
One solution which has been proposed
is the construction of high speed turn
offs, which amount to a taxi strip
parallel to the runway necessitating only
a ten degree turn off to it so that the
pilot landing can quickly clear the run-
way at a relatively high speed of, say,
70 mph, insteading of having to prac-
tically stop for a sharp turnoff, as is
necessary at most airports like Willow
Run. This would help save time per
operation. Another suggestion to in-
crease the number of take offs and land-
ings which can be handled is the con-
struction of short runways, parallel to

those now in existence, for use of lighter
planes which need only one tenth as
much space to operate.
But both of these mean the expendi-
ture of cash by the airport owners, and
most airfields have traditionally devel-
oped with no help from the government.
Increasing their facilities is like any
other attempt to get businessmen to "do
it now," to provide for a forecasted
probable increase in demand. The CAA
operates all but a dozen towers at civilian
airfields across the United States, but it
does not own the airports.
Today's busiest airports are feeling
the press of lack of proper facilities to
handle yesterday's 300-mph aircraft.
Boston, Chicago, and Washington are
not going to feel any slow-down from
their already jammed facilities. Today
we have jets with speeds of twice the
300 mph commercial liners just readying
themselves for service. The operational
problems of such jet transports will soon
be acute.
Today's Methods
Assuming that control of aircraft
under IFR conditions will provide them
with a guaranteed separation, and that
VFR aircraft must be separated from
IFR aircraft, let us examine what has
been done to provide these separations
with the existing terminal facilities, ATC
equipment, and personnel of the CAA.
The Air Force has agreed that all
non-tactical flights will operate under
positive control with the CAA unless
over 20,000 feet. The Air Transport
Association has agreed to CAA control
of all flights over 10,000 feet. The
Civil Aeronautics Board has opened
three super skyways between 17,000 and
35,000 feet which will include IFR for
the coming jet transports. The first ele-
ments of automation for ATC have been
put into effect including the use of com-
puters to handle the job of keeping IFR
information on flight progress boards at
the air controllers finger-tips. The old
method of computing the data for posi-
tion of a given IFR flight by hand re-
quired about two minutes with a circular
slide rule and then writing by hand on
a strip of paper the necessary informa-
tion. The new device can compute 50
such strips in a minute, thus keeping
the flight progress boards up to date in
a crowded ATC center.
In addition, at least at Willow Run,
the CAA has a radio channel over which
any aircraft, including the "small boys,"
can call in giving its position, and re-
ceive a reply informing it vocally of the
picture on the CAA towers radar scope
as to aircraft in its area. All of these
uses of existing facilities are helping to
decrease the collision hazard.
As to the equipment and facilities
which have been proposed and we may
expect in the future, high on the list
is a combined system of surveillance
radar, computer, and teletype links,
which would keep the aircraft under
signs over Willow Run

positive control at all times. This sys-
tem would be an extension of the
present one with the added feature that
there would be no gaps nor appreciable
time lag in information as now exist,
and eventually the computer would even
give a warning signal of potential col-
lision situations as the information of
IFR flight position and unknown air-
craft positions were fed into its neces-
sary devices. One of the unknowns
which is still a very sticky problem for
this future computer is the altitude of
the unknown plane intruding on a cer-
tain airspace. A known flight can be
asked for its altitude and assumed to
stay where it says it is. An unknown
flight's altitude must be determined by
an up-to-now non-existent (in a prac-
tical sense) height-finding or "3-D"
radar.
When these systems come into being,
they will allow ATC a continuous posi-
tive control af all IFR aircraft, plus some
method of aiding the pilot in the avoid-
ance of unknown aircraft which may
appear in his airspace. Rules which will
separate certain airspace for IFR only
will also help. One of the future pos-
sibilities is a radar carried in the trans-
port which would warn of the presence
of other aircraft. At present the only
systems available do not have a practical
means of distinguishing between the
nearby aircraft which are unscheduled
potential colliders, and those normally
scheduled in the area. Thus over a

"goes off" all the time and is practically
useless when needed most.
The proposed increases in airport fa-
cilities have been mentioned under topics
of parallel runways and high speed turn
offs. Also in this category are better
radar which are not subject to the usual
clutter from local precipitation and
ground return, and better lighting and
posting of exit rams to and from run-
ways.
Indianapolis Is Advanced
One of today's most modern air con-
trol systems is in use at Indianapolis
where an additional device has found
application for speedy tower control of
landings. It is the use of a closed cir-
cuit TV picture of the main radar scope
whereby the chief controller can assign
assistants to control an aircraft by simply
pointing to the position of a blip on
the display, the image of his hand over
the main console is transmitted with the
whole picture and then the controller
concerned can make immediate identifi-
cation of which aircraft he will control
without having to be told by some system
of co-ordinates. What it amounts to is
this, suppose you were looking at TV
in your living-room and the picture was
of a group of moving dancers. You
could point out one of the group in-
stead of trying to describe the position
in words to the person beside you watch-
ing the same screen. And, if you were
on the phone describing the group of
dancers to a neighbor, instead of trying
to describe the position you could just
point again, for your neighbor has a
closed TV circuit picture of your set and
your hand in front of it.
These are some of the new devices
for controlling the coming aircraft and
keeping them separated both horizontally
and laterally, and for aiding them in
making fast landings and take-offs. We
are coming into an era of automatic
flight processing, and automatic flight
information processing. The equipment
costs money, and money is needed from
Congress, but there is also an obvious
time lag in the construction, installation
and co-ordination of these devices. At
the Naval Air Station at Atlantic City
there is a new National Aviation Fa-
cilities Experimental Center being set up
where teams of scientists, pilots, air con-
trollers and engineers will work on new
navigation and communications equip-
ment at a cost of S3.5 million per year.
This is one of the Airways Modernzation
Boards steps in helping combat the air-
ways collision problem.
Future Work
In the coming days there will come
a Federation Aviation Board to replace
the CAB with authority over all military
and civilian aircraft, which will allow
even more co-ordination of equipment,
and man power. The fact that figures
can be cited to show infrequency of col-
lision per thousand passenger miles is
not the point. Collisions occur but they
are preventable. The young engineer
with imagination will not be just a pas-
senger on these airlines but will be gain-
ing technical training to solve these
problems of air transportation in this,
the air age.
If he continues to keep the ball roll-
ing and works hard on the technical
problems, the incidence of collisions will
at last begin to cease.

ACOUSTIC
NOISE
When huge rocket engines lift a
ballistic missile or satellite vehicle
into the air, the thundering noise of
the engines violently shakes intricate
electronic components and the missile
structure itself. Acoustic noise is
one of the many environments that must
be thoroughly explored and understood
by the missile designer.
But it is expensive and impractical
to conduct acoustic noise tests by
operating rocket engines on the ground.
Noise—of the same frequencies and
amplitudes as rocket engine noise—must
be produced in the laboratory.
Engineers at Avco's Research and
Advanced Development Division have met
this problem by designing a versatile
high-intensity acoustic noise generator.
Based on electromagnetic principles,
it creates noise environments of the
same frequency spectra as rocket
or jet engines.
This successful effort is now part of
the division's complete environmental
testing laboratory, where it is producing
information for Avco scientists and
engineers responsible for ICBM nose cones.
Acoustic noise work is one of the many
development programs that proceed
simultaneously with theoretical and
applied research at RAD. The mutual
stimulation of scientists and engineers
in many disciplines occurs naturally
at Avco, where the search for new
knowledge and its application
go forward under one roof.
Research and Advanced Development is
more than a descriptive title at Avco.
It is a concept that promotes creativity.

STRAIGHT TALK TO ENGINEERS
from Donald W. Douglas, Jr.
President, Douglas Aircraft Company
I'm sure you've heard about Douglas projects like
Thor, Nike-Ajax, Nike-Hercules, Nike-Zeus,
Honest John, Genie and Sparrow. While these
are among the most important defense programs
in our nation today, future planning is moving
into even more stimulating areas.
Working as we are on the problems of space
flight and at the very borderline of the unknown,
engineering excellence in all fields is essential.
For you engineers who can help us move forward,
opportunities are almost as limitless as space
itself.
If you thrive on tough problems — and there
are many —we'd like to discuss a future at
Douglas with you.

Everyone is well aware of the great strides recently
taken in numerous fields of scientific and technical en-
deavor. As never before, the scientist holds a position
enviable in the American public eye. National defense has
brought to every home the importance of scientific and
engineering developments. Less well known, however, is
the diligent, slow (even primitive by today's standards of
rapid progress) work turned in between the turn of the
century and World War I (and earlier), by men who never
won the Nobel Prizes and fame, heaped on today's top
scientists. "Pioneering Progress," a new regular feature in
the Technic, will tell the story of these modern pioneers.
This month's feature could find nothing more appropriate
than guided missiles, which had primitive roots in the by KEN DEC, '61E
century-old rockets of Asia, and were the object of con-
siderable study and research, even before World War I.
Within the past decade the research
and development of rockets has
taken a very important place in the
world situation. Seldom does a day go
by when one can open a newspaper and
read of some country launching a rocket
which carried a satellite out of the at-
mosphere, or could deliver a hydrogen
warhead half way around the world. To
the lay person this sudden surge in rocket
technology may seem recent. In reality
rockets have been on the scene for some
1,000 years. Some historians suspect
their roots go back three or four thou-
sand years. What ever the case, it is
certain that the rocket is not wholly a
product of our modern civilization. Like
so many great developments of the past,
the rocket has come into being through
long, intensive research.
Early History
Rockets have been mentioned several
times in ancient history. Some historians
propose that rockets were used in China
as early as 2000 to 3000 B.C., but as
yet these proposals remain unproven.
Most evidence places the rocket in China
at about 1040 A.D. These early missiles
were probably discovered accidentally
while observing faulty firecrackers. Most
people have seen a defective firecracker
propelled along the ground by a stream
of burning powder. This propulsive
effect was experimented upon by ancient
Chinese scientists, and it was found that
firecrackers could be made "defective"
on purpose. The Chinese immediately
took advantage of the discovery, for in
1230 they inflicted heavy losses on the
Mongolian cavalry with rockets shot
from crossbows.
In subsequent centuries the develop-
ment of rockets was rather limited. Basi-
cally the rocket was a paper cylinder rein-
forced with steel. This tube was filled
with gun powder, sealed, and placed on
some sort of guiding stick. As time went
on the size of these missiles became
greater, and in 1668 rockets up to 132
lbs. were used in Berlin.
Most of the large rockets were used
specifically for warfare. A local ruler
in India defeated the British in the
battle of Gunter (1760) with 1200
rocket troops. In 1805 the British or-
dered a rocket with a range of 2,000
yards into mass production. A year later
the British used 25,000 of these missiles
to completely destroy the city of Copen-
hagen. Rockets for warfare continued
to be used until, on flat terrain, the
Austrian rocket corps were destroyed by
Prussian artillery. This was the last
major rocket battle until World War II.
At about the middle of the 19th cen-
tury scientists began to experiment with
liquid propellant rockets. Previously,
solid fuels, such as gun powder and
resins, were used, but now liquids, such
as hydrogen peroxide or gasoline and
nitric acid were being investigated. At
the end of the century Paulet, of Peru,
claimed to have launched a 5 pound
liquid propellant rocket which developed
a thrust of 198 pounds. Paulet, how-
ever, did not release his discovery until
1927, and therefore was not believed
by many scientists.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Recent progress in the field of rockets and missiles can be seen in this Atlas
intercontinental ballistic missile. As the gantry towers are rolled away, the huge ma-
chine seemingly strains at the leash to begin the trip which will take it far above the
earth's atmosphere, and on which the Atlas will attain speeds of near 15,000 mph.
Modern Rockets
The first quarter of the 20th century
added very little to rocket development.
During World War I both France and
the United States experimented with
solid rocket fuels. Progress, however,
was slow because of the lack of metals
capable of withstanding high tempera-
ture exhaust. Because of the numerous
failures in liquid fuel experiments many
of the missiles of World War I used
solid propellants. Even these solid-
fuel rockets were in limited war use.
Some, shot from moving railroad cars,
accounted for German zepplins.
After the war, two men in America
went back to their private experimenta-
tion with rockets. Dr. C. N. Hickman
continued his research in solid fuel
rockets, especially in the ordnance field.
He is now regarded as the man who
set the solid fuel rocket development into
action during World War II. Dr. R. H.
Goddard, on the other hand, worked
with liquid propellants. In 1926, with
grants from the Smithsonian Institute, he
launched a nose-driven liquid fuel
rocket. This was the first flight of its
type in America.
Goddard, and his research team, con-
tinued to experiment. In 1929 they
launched a liquid rocket containing a
camera and instruments. By 1930 these
men were firing eleven foot, highly de-
veloped missiles. Although Goddard and
his team were 5 years ahead of the rest
of the world in rocket research, the se-
recy of their experimentation was a hin-
drance.
German Rockets
At the time of Goddard's research,
many German rocket societies began to
spring up in that country. These clubs
had the interest of large groups of
people, and were therefore able to lure
scientists and engineers into research
work. This interest and store of man
and brain power caused the German
surge to the top of rocket technology in
World War II.
In the beginning of the war the Ger-
man army took over the records of the
German Rocket Society, and hired Dr.
Werhner Von Braun to lead a "crash
program" in rocket development. The
army built a rocket development station
in Berlin and quickly began to turn out
a series of A vehicles.
The A-l developed a thrust of 660
lbs. from liquid oxygen and alcohol. The
A-2 reached an altitude of 6,500 ft.,
while the A-3, a 25 ft., 1,650 lb. mis-
sile, went up iy2 miles. Before any
more development could take place the
Germans moved their testing center to
Peenemiinde, on the Baltic Sea.
It was here that the A-4 was devel-
oped. The name of this missile was later
changed to V-2 (Vengeance Weapon
No. 2) for propaganda reasons. It was
a huge rocket by common standards,
weighing 14 tons, standing 47 feet high
and developing a speed of 3,600 mph
at 56,00 lbs. thrust. These rockets were
built by the thousands in underground
plants at Nordhausen and elsewhere.
Besides the V-2, the Germans pro-
duced jet propelled buzz bombs and
other designations as the A-4b (a winged
version of the V-2), A-5, A-6, A-7, A-8,
A-9 and A-10. The last two were never
built but are important for their aero-
nautical implications. The A-10 weighed
76 tons and developed 220 tons of
thrust. With this rocket as a first stage,
and the V-2 as the second, the Germans
planned to bomb New York.
After the war, Britain, America and
Russia captured the German laboratories
and development centers. It is from
these centers that the foundations of
modern rocket research have come.
America alone captured over a hundred
V-2's and used them as a catapult for
their present program. Russia is sus-
pected of obtaining the A-9 and A-10
when it over-ran Peenemiinde.
From the end of the war until now
great strides have been made in rocket
research. Though these developments
may seem recent, they are, in reality, a
product of the research and experimenta-
tion of past pioneers in the rocket field.

energy. Rutherford then found that some
normally stable atoms could be made to
undergo nuclear transformations when
bombarded by the decay products of
naturally radioactive isotopes. This type
of work gave a rough idea as to the
magnitude of the forces which hold the
nuclear matter together. The scope of
the problem may be realized when one
considers that the attractive force hold-
ing the nuclear particles together is much
greater than the electrostatic forces which
hold the atom together. In fact, the
binding energy of a particle in the nu-
cleus is of the order of 10 million elec-
tron volts, while the outer, valence, elec-
trons in an atom are bound with an
energy of only about one electron volt.
In addition, the nuclear forces are of
extremely short range.
Progress was accelerated in the early
1930's with the discovery of the neutron
and positron (positive electron) along
with the development of such research
facilities as the cyclotron and Van de
Graaff generator, which serve for the
production of artificial, controlled, nu-
clear projectiles. Moreover, the Geiger-
Miiller counter provided a means for
detecting individual nuclear disintegra-
tions. Due to these developments it was
possible to produce artificially a large
number of radioactive nuclei under con-
trolled conditions and to study their
mode of decay in some detail, thus pro-
viding experimental data which could be
used as a test for any nuclear model.
One of the earliest nuclear models
which was reasonably successful pictured
the nucleus as having many of the prop-
erties of a liquid drop. Much of the
data on heavy nuclei could be analyzed
by this type of presentation, particularly
the phenomenon of fission. It was clear,
however, that this model was not com-
pletely adequate, since it failed when it
was applied to light nuclei. Neverthe-
less, it has served a useful purpose, and
it would seem that any complete model
would have to include many features of
the liquid drop.
Further stimulation was given to the
field of nuclear physics in the 1940 s
with the development of the nuclear
reactor as an abundant source of radio-
active isotopes. The scintillation counter,
along with major advances in electronic
techniques, provided further aids in ob-
(Continued from page 38)
taining more accurate measurement of
nuclear properties.
In general, the nuclear properties
which are of interest are: the positions
of the energy levels, their lifetimes, the
spins associated with them, their parity,
and the nature of the radiations emitted
in making transitions from one level to
another. The positions of the energy
levels in radioactive nuclei may be ob-
tained by the measurement of the energy
of the gamma ray or conversion electron
which is emitted when the nucleus de-
cays from one level to another of lower
energy. The energies of conversion elec-
trons are measured accurately (to one
part in a thousand) by the beta spectro-
graph. When conversion electrons are
not present, the energy of the transition
may be obtained (with less accuracy) by
measuring the gamma-ray energy with a
scintillation spectrometer. At times the
nucleus may remain in a given state for
an appreciable time before decaying to
another state. When this condition exists,
it is of value to measure its lifetime. Tech-
niques are available for measuring life-
times as short as 10'11 second. Spins
and parities of nuclear states and the
properties of radiation emitted may
sometimes be obtained by measuring the
spatial distribution of the emitted radi-
ations from nuclei whose orientation is
known.
Recently some success has been ob-
tained in unifying and interpreting these
nuclear properties by means of the shell
model of Mayer and Jensen and its varia-
tions. In this model it is assumed that
like nuclear particles (neutrons and pro-
tons) couple in pairs, with their spins
antiparallel. In the building up of nu-
clei, these particles are added to the
shell of lowest energy until the shell is
filed. The number1 of particles necessary
for a shell to be closed is called a magic
number (2, 8, 20, 28, 50, etc.). Nuclei
with closed shells, such as those of oxy-
gen and helium, exhibit unique proper-
ties of stability and are relatively abun-
dant in nature. When a particle is added
to the nucleus having a magic number,
the additional particle must go into a
shell of higher energy, and many of the
properties of this new nucleus may be
predicted by assuming that it consists of
a single particle moving under the influ-
ence of the closed-shell core. The prob-
lem then is reduced to a two-body
problem.
Various refinements can be brought
about by introducing certain types of
coupling between the closed-shell core
and the outer particles and by consider-
ing deformations and collective motions
of particles in the core. With the intro-
duction of such refinements, it is possible
to interpret many of the nuclear proper-
ties which have been measured, and in-
deed it is often possible to make pre-
dictions about some nuclear properties
which can be verified experimentally.
While the shell model is not completely
adequate at the present time, it does
show promise of being a step in the
right direction. Considering the lack of
accurate knowledge of the nature and
type of nuclear forces, this experimental
model has been of great service to nu-
clear physicists. It is to be hoped that
with the accumulation of more accurate
data on nuclear properties, further, more
exact, models will lead to a more com-
plete understanding of the nucleus.
Spectroscopy at U of M
The Engineering Research Institute
has been administering research in the
field of nuclear spectroscopy for many
years. One of the principle investigators
in this area was James M. Cork, former
Professor of Physics at the University,
who had supervised numerous Institute
propects in nuclear physics prior to his
death in 1957. Dr. Cork also supervised
the construction of the University's cyclo-
tron and was an internationally recog-
nized authority in the fields of radio-
activity and nuclear physics. Under his
direction the investigations in this field
were expanded and intensified at the
University.
Dr. Marcellus L. Deidenbeck, Profes-
sor of Physics, is the present supervisor
of these projects in nuclear spectroscopy.
Professor Deidenbeck came to the Uni-
versity in 1946 and has been actively
engaged in research in nuclear physics
since that time. He has been particularly
interested in such phases as Van de
Graaff generators, coincidence measure-
ments, beta spectroscopy, and scintilla-
tion spectrometers. He was associated
for many years with Dr. Cork in this

PIONEERS IN EARTH-SPACE COMMUNICATIONS
The exploration of outer space will take a new step for-
ward with the completion of the new giant radio antenna
being installed by JPL near Barstow, California. This huge
"dish," 85 ft. in diameter, will enable the Laboratory
scientists to probe still farther into space problems.
Information thus obtained and combined with lessons
still being learned from the successful Army "Explorer"
satellites, will provide invaluable basic data for the
development of communication systems to serve space
exploration programs. Long range communication will
begin as a one way link from space to earth, developing
later into tracking and communicating with lunar vehicles
at far greater ranges.
This activity will be part of a great research and devel-
opment program to be operated jointly by JPL and the
United States Army Missile Command.

PROGRESS REPORT

Freezing water
to warm a mine
Inco shows a king-size operation
that helps mine more Nickel
The bigger the mine, the more men at work,
the more air they need. Gales of air. Warmed
in winter. Cooled in summer. That's the rea-
son for this mammoth "air conditioner" in
an Inco-Canada mine.
In winter it raises the temperature of cold
air from outside by making ice. In summer
it uses the ice to cool air that's too hot! (See
diagram below)

In winter, cold air is blown through sprays of
warmer water. The water loses its heat, freezes
into mountains of solid ice. In the process, the latent
heat of freezing is transferred to the air, warms it up
for use inside the mine.
At full capacity in a winter season, this
system alone can generate as much heat as
350,000 gallons of fuel oil. During this
period, 150,000 tons of ice may form. (See
photo at left)
Installations like this are expensive in
time and money. Such outlays are typical of
many made by Inco-Canada. Their cost adds
up to millions. Results are—to continue the
increased production of Nickel.

explodes in an air burst or impacts. The
Inertial system is gyroscopically stabilized
so that it maintains its reference to
launch point at all times, regardless of
the missile's altitude. The system also
senses any off-course motion and imme-
diately provides the autopilot with the
necessary data to position the controls
for a return to course. The Mace's In-
ertial guidance system was developed by
the AC Spark Plug Division of General
Motors.
A recovery system, developed by The
Martin Company, permits the re-use of
the TM-76. The section of the missile
containing the warhead is replaced by
the recovery kit. When the flight is com-
pleted, the Mace floats gently to earth
under three giant 100 foot cargo para-
chutes, the landing shock being absorbed
by large air bags of rubberized fabric.
The warhead may be reinserted, in the
field if necessary, making the missile
completely operational in a short time.
In this manner, airmen may be given
much more intensive training in the
launching sequence while the cost will
be considerably less.
Air Force missile teams are now
launching the TM-76s completely on
their own with no help from Martin
Company field test engineers. The early
utilization of service launch teams on
pre-production Maces will promote fast,
efficient training. When the missiles
start rolling off the assembly lines in
quantity, trained missile men will be
ready to form the nucleus of new Mace
squadrons.
The TM-76 Mace weapons system is
completely mobile and designed to oper-
ate in the most rugged terrain. Hidden
launch sites make enemy aerial recon-
naissance extremely difficult. A "Trans-
launcher" serves as both zero-length
launcher and transporter, while a "Tera-
cruzer" serves as prime mover for all
ground support equipment. Both vehicles
travel on huge balloon-type tires which
may be automatically inflated or deflated
by the driver to adjust for terrain con-
ditions.
The Mace, designed and developed by
The Martin Company, is a ground-to-
ground, jet-powered, 650 mph tactical
missile, 44 feet long with a 23 foot wing
span. Travelling at altitudes over 40,000
feet or at extremely low level, according
to the tactical situation, the missile dives
on target at supersonic speeds. Capable
of carrying a nuclear warhead, the Mace's
instant retaliation capability will be an
effective deterrent to enemy aggression.
New Energizer Packs More Power
of Alkaline Cell in Flashlight
Battery Size
A new portable power source packing
the energy and high current drain char-
acteristics of an alkaline cell into the
compact space of a standard flashlight
battery has been announced by National
Carbon Company, Division of Union
Carbide Corporation. This "Eveready"*
leak-proof alkaline cell energizer will
give up to 10 times longer service than
a standard flashlight cell at approximately
3 times the cost.
Described as a significant technological
breakthrough in power sources for elec-
tronic equipment, the new cell is engi-
neered for high-drain, continuous duty,
making possible portable devices using
transistors and vacuum tubes that were
previously not feasible, and resulting in
more efficient operation of existing port-
able equipment. In addition to the
amount of energy available, the alkaline
cell can deliver energy at a much faster
rate than conventional flashlight cells.
Rated at 1.5 volts, the new energizer
is available in two sizes—the "D" stand-
ard cell size, which weighs 3.8 ounces,
and the half-length "D" weighing 1.6
ounces. The two cells have short circuit
amperages of 20 and 8 amperes, respec-
tively.
The alkaline cell has a low temperature
performance rating of approximately
three times that of the best low-tempera-
ture cells previously available. The new
energizer is designed to operate at tem-
peratures from —40 to +200 degrees
Fahrenheit. Physically resembling a
standard flashlight battery, the new cell
is hermetically sealed and encased in
steel.

Vought offers this range
to the young engineer
At Chance Vought the engineer's assign-
ments range from the depths of the ocean to
the farthest reaches of space ... from hard-
ware operating aboard the Navy's nuclear-
armed submarines to space research vehicles
still on the boards.
Here the engineer contributes to projects
such as the record-smashing Crusader jet
fighter series . .. the Regulus missiles .. .
and advanced weapons, details of which are
still classified.
Under the guidance of the Vought engi-
neer, such weapons take shape. He super-
vises critical tests, and he introduces the
weapons to the men with whom they
will serve.
Engineers with many specialties share these
experiences. Today, for example, Vought is
at work on important projects involving:
SPACECRAFT AND ASTRONAUTICS
ADVANCED PROPULSION METHODS
ELECTRONICS DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE
ANTISUBMARINE WARFARE
Vought's excellent R&amp;D facilities help the
engineer through unexplored areas. And by
teaming up with other specialists against
mutual challenges, the Vought engineer
leams new fields while advancing in his own.

Young engineers find in missiles the fast-breaking,
pace-setting assignments they like. At Chance Vought,
missiles also offer the added environmental challenges
of sea and space.
Vought's first space research vehicles — missiles of

"Movies are better than ever" — with much
of the credit due to the engineering advance-
ments of the past few years.
by MAX LEGATSKI, '61E
The achievement of the American
motion picture industry—an inex-
pensive recreation which can be supplied
continuously to people of nearly all ages
and almost every class, geographical loca-
tion, and cultural status—would be re-
garded as incredible if it had not hap-
pened. But today the motion picture in-
dustry is huge and now, after a brief
lull during the TV rage, it is growing
faster than ever. Indeed, the industry's
slogan "movies are better than ever"
must be true.
"Spectaculars," as well as excellent
movie-making material are responsible
for today's boxoffice crowds. Most
people are willing to pay for big screen
realism, but very few of them are even
aware of the differences between Cinema-
Scope, Cinerama, Todd-AO, and conven-
tional movies. A description of these
recent motion picture developments may
allow the movie-goer to more fully ap-
preciate Hollywood's tremendous attempt
to produce realistic motion pictures.
Anamorphic Lens
Turning first to the most common big-
screen system, CinemaScope, which has
been developed by Twentieth Century
Fox in the last several years we discover
that the principle behind it has been
known for more than twenty years. It
was in 1937 when a Frenchman, Henri
Chretien, an honorary professor at the
Sorbonne and at the Optical Institute,
developed what he called an anamorpho-
scope. The anamorphoscope was a lens
which returned a previously distorted
image to its original shape, thereby per-
mitting a 35 mm camera to "reach out"
to either side and "compress" a wide
angle scene into a narrow strip of film.
When this compressed image was pro-
jected through an anamorphic lens onto
a wide, slightly curved screen, the viewer
had the feeling of being surrounded by
the scene, and was therefore not con-
scious of the limitations of the screen's
framework.
The anamorphoscope is the grandaddy
of today's CinemaScope, a completely
engineered system for the practical pre-
sentation of wide screen pictures com-
bined with stereophonic sound. Using
this same general type of system with
only a few of the details different are
Paramounts Vista-Vision and Americal
Internationals Superama. VistaVision
does differ from conventional 35 mm
movies in a big way however. This is
due to the fact that the film is run
horizontally through the camera, rather
than vertically. By this method, the
width of the picture is not limited by
the film, so that a wider picture may be
shown to the viewer.
Big Screens More Complex
While CinemaScope and VistaVision
are quite commonplace throughout the
country there are three big-screen spec-
taculars, Cinerama, Cinamiracle, and
Todd-AO, that have seen only limited
use in large cities due to the extensive
equipment required.
Cinerama and Cinamiracle, are basically
the same. Cinerama employs a wide
screen by using three cameras and three
projectors; Cinemiracle accomplishes the
same thing by using mirrors.
Cinerama employs up to nine sound
tracks, which usually must be manually
controlled. The effect is the same as
that of stereophonic sound.
Projecting from three 35 mm pro-
jectors on a curved screen, Cinerama and
Cinemiracle may at first appear to be
only slightly different from CinemaScope
or VistaVision. The filming of the for-
mer is however much more complex,
since all three cameras and the sound
must be perfectly synchronized.
Conventional 35 mm film (without
anamorphic lens) captures about 40 to
50 degree of surroundings. Using three
cameras, Cinerama captures about 140
degrees, therefore giving the same effect
as the anamorphic lens systems. Pro-
jection from almost three square inches
of film means extremely low film-to-
screen magnification, therefore much
greater clarity.
Todd-AO also projects onto a wide
curved screen, but it uses only one cam-
era and thus has no anamorphic lens.
The large Todd-AO picture is attained
by filming on 65 mm film and projecting
from 70 mm film. "Oklahoma,"
"Around the World in 80 Days," and
"South Pacific" are the only pictures ever

made with larger than 35 mm film, ex-
cept for Fox Films' 70 mm "Grandeur,"
released in 1929, which was "killed" by
the depression. ("CinemaScope 55" is
filmed on 55 mm film but is "shrunk"
to conventional 35 mm film for projec-
tion.) Todd-AO uses six sound tracks.
3-D Returns
The three dimensional films which
were popular a few years ago are now
being re-released. The secret of these
3-D pictures lies in the polarized lenses
used for both filming and projection.
To understand the function of the polar-
ized lens, it must be understood that a
single light wave travels in a plane, and
that reflected light from any point con-
sists of light waves in all planes. A
polarized lens may be considered a filter,
analogous to a slotted screen, through
which light waves, or components of
light waves, in one plane only may
pass. A vertical polarized lens filters

Max W. Legatski, a sophomore
in Science Engineering, is the au-
thor of the article on cinematogra-
phy. A graduate of Bartlesville
(Oklahoma) High School, Max is

or chemical engineering.
While in high school Max was

out all horizontal components of light
waves, as may be seen by the analogy
of the slotted screen.
A three dimensional motion picture is
filmed with two interlocking 35 mm
cameras, one with a horizontal polarized
lens and the other with a vertical polar-
ized lens, with the lenses at eye dis-
tance apart. The two films are then
projected onto a screen, again through
horizontal and vertical polarized lenses,
and viewed through glasses consisting
of a vertical and a horizontal polaroid
filter. The 3-D effect is obtained because
the left eye of the viewer sees only
what was seen by the left camera, and
the right eye sees only what was seen by
the right camera.
If one of the two film strips of a 3-D
movie is shown by an ordinary projector,
it cannot be distinguished from a con-
ventional movie. Because the polarized
lenses act as filters, enormous projection
light is required for three dimensional
pictures.
Sound System Adds Realism

taculars would not be complete without

tem used, most of which are labeled
"Stereophonic." Stereophonic sound em-

Since summer vacation is usually filled
with physical rather than mental exer-
cises, we decided to give you a break
and print a few teasers that won't rup-
ture any brain cells. This will give you
a chance to build up your confidence
for the new semester. Have fun, but
don't expect this generosity next month.
This first puzzle shouldn't be too hard
for the upperclassmen. It's merely a
variation of a connect-the-dot puzzle (a
teaser last semester). Below are twenty-
five dots forming a square. Connect
twelve of these dots with straight lines,
so as to form a perfect cross which has
five does inside it and eight outside.
This next teaser should interest the
crossword puzzle fan.

Our next puzzle requires only a simple
yes or no anwswer. Just read the ques-
tion carefully and you shouldn't have
any trouble. The phrasing may seem a
little confusing but you've probably seen
worse on some of your exams.
"If the puzzle you solved before you
solved the puzzle you solved after you
solved the puzzle you solved before you
solved this one, was harder than the
puzzle you solved after you solved the
puzzle you solved before you solved this
one, was the puzzle you solved before
you solved this one harder than this
one?"
When completed the five words read-
ing across must be the same as the five
words reading down. Including the let-
ters already present in the puzzle there
are 7 R's, 7 E's, 3 V's, 2 N's, 2 D's,
2 Y's, 1 T and 1 O.

Here are a couple of teasers that re-
quire a little mathematics and logic. Do
not fear. The only math requirement
is advanced arithmetic.
Hans, Reinzi, Egbert, and Pedro are
going fare-hunting tomorrow, on a boule-
vard that runs directly North and South,
with no traffic lights. They estimate that
equal numbers of pedestrians walk in
each direction, at an average of four
miles an hour.
Hans says: "You're all crazy to use
up gas cruising around all the time. I'm
going to park beside the curb until a
fare comes along."
Reinzi says: "I'm going to cruise up
and down at four miles an hour, and
I'll have twice your chance of picking
up a fare."
Egbert says: "Eight miles an hour for
me, up and down the boulevard; and
I'll have twice as much chance as either
of you."
Pedro says: "I'm going to average
twelve miles an hour and I'll have twice
as much change as Egbert of getting a
fare."
Just think about this and figure out
the true facts in your head, deciding
who was right and who was wrong.
This funnel was devised by an ancient
king to determine by lot which of his
captives should die. They contained
white sugar-pills and black poison pills.
Each had a spring-release at the end to

let one pill fall at a time when the spring
was pressed in.
Each captive's fate depended upon the
second pill which fell into his hand. He
had to replace the first pill in the funnel,
no matter what its color, and swallow
the second one.
The figure shows 6 pills for three cap-
tives named Joe, Jack, and James. Each
had to spell his name, removing and
replacing one pil for each letter, and
then eating the first after his name was
spelled. (That is, J-O-E swallowed Pill
#4.) Where would you place three
black pills in the funnel, so that no one
would draw one after spelling his name?

Students who major in Engineering Mechanics take advanced work in mathematics,
elasticity, plasticity, dynamics, vibrations, fluid dynamics, and thermodynamics. They are
prepared to work on fundamental problems in all branches of engineering except those
which require extensive knowledge in electricity or chemistry. Many industries are asking
for men specifically trained in Engineering Mechanics.
Engineering Mechanics is often intimately associated with the most modern devel-
opments in engineering and, like other engineers, many have found their way into man-
agement and ownership.
The College of Engineering pioneered in offering a degree program in Engineering
Mechanics and has educated many recognized leaders of teaching and industrial practice
in this field.
The photograph above illustrates the use of models for the study of stresses and defor-
mations. Here a one-quarter size model of a portion of a nuclear reactor is studied under
load by the use of a large number of resistance strain gauges. The general modeling laws
developed in Experimental Mechanics are used to translate the test results into data
applicable to the actual reactor, even though the model and reactor are of different size
and are operated at different temperatures.

Nearly a do2en publications per year
have resulted from this work. In recent
years these articles have dealt with the
decay scheme of various elements such
as platinum-199, molydenum-101, cal-
cium-49, and cerium-143; nuclear levels
in certain metallic elements; radiations
from different isotopes; etc. These arti-
cles have appeared in various scientific
and technical journals, including the
Physical Review and the Bulletin of the
American Physical Society.
Many graduate students in the De-
partment of Physics have participated
in these investigations throughout the
years. During the past ten years approxi-
mately thirty-five doctoral dissertations
have resulted from this work, and five
additional Ph.D degrees will be awarded
in June.
The research on the spectroscopy of
radioactive nuclei is supported in part by
the Office of Naval Research. A portion
of the program is carried out at the
Argonne National Laboratories in co-
operation with the Atomic Energy Com-
mission. For the past eight years one
doctoral candidate has conducted research
for his thesis at the Argonne Labora-
tories, where Dr. Weidenbeck serves as
a consultant. The irradiation of the sam-
ples for these studies is done at the
Argonne Laboratories, Oak Ridge, and,
more recently, in the Ford Nuclear Re-
actor on North Campus, where short-life
samples will soon be obtained a few
seconds after irradiation.

Arch
The Arch, now starting its fourth year
of operation, is printed with the follow-
ing objectives in mind; first, to keep
students abreast of College of Engineer-
ing current events, and second, to create
better school spirit.
Copies are distributed free of charge
to all students and faculty members in
the College of Engineering. In each of
the 16 issues a year an attempt is made
to achieve a good balance of college
functions, current engineering news, peo-
ple, jokes, and advertising.
James Stevens is Editor-in-Chief for
the coming semester.
Quarterdeck
The main objective of The Quarter-
deck Society, in the words of Commodore
Richard Cumming, is to promote an
active interest in the field of Naval Archi-
tecture and Marine Engineering. Open
to any Naval Arch student the Society
achieves this goal in three basic ways—
preparation of papers by prospective
members, contact with groups at other
schools and universities, and addresses
by men active in the field of Naval Archi-
tecture.
Any Naval Arch student may apply
for membership in the Society. After
their application is accepted the pros-
pective member is required to present a
technical paper on some aspect of Naval
Arch or Marine Engineering. Upon de-
livery of the paper the student is voted
to full membership.
Last year guest speakers of the So-
ciety included Harold F. Robinson, Chief
Naval Architect, Bethlehem Shipbuild-
ing; David Maclntyre, Naval Architect,
Alcoa; and Prof. R. B. Couch, Chairman
of the Naval Arch-Marine Eng. depart-
ment.
The officers for this year are: Richard
A. Cumming, Commodore; Andrs Zie-
dins, Vice-Commodore; Neil Miller,
Purser; Judith Robinson, Steward; Frank
Slyker, Program Chairman; Orhan
Gurel, Membership Chairman.
Chi Epsilon
Chi Epsilon, civil engineering honor-
ary, is designed to distinguish those
undergraduates in civil who have an
outstanding scholastic record and to de-
velop those characteristics of scholarship,
character, practicality, and sociability
which are necessary for successful achieve-
ments in engineering.
At meetings usually held twice a
month interesting speakers talk on top-
ics which, in general, are non-technical.
Two of these meetings each are set aside
as smokers for the interviewing of pros-
pective new members. Although the size
of the organization is not limited in any
way only those in the upper third of
their class will be considered.
The officers for this year are: William
Perpich, President; Alan Mollenkopf,
Vice-President; Pearce Klazer, Treasurer;
Shantilal Dani, Secretary.
A.I.Ch.E.
The American Institute of Chemical
Engineers, one of the most active groups
on campus, sponsors a weekly luncheon
for the purpose of providing an informal
social professional period for the chemi-
cal engineering students and faculty. In
the words of President Jon Gaston this
"period" is designed to be something
more than the superficial and competitive
atmosphere encountered in the classroom,
with an emphasis on a worthwhile, pro-
vocative, and educational (as well as
entertaining) program.
At these Wednesday luncheons an
average of 50 students enjoys menus that
have included at various times, hotdogs,
hamburgers, sandwiches and soup. The
programs—as varied as the menus—have
included A. S. Lohwater on "Education
in Russia," Vice-President James A.
Lewis on "Education in the United
States," talks and a film on rockets and
space travel, and a debate between John
Stern (UAW) and Prof. D. L. Katz
(Chairman of the chem-met dept.) on
the pros and cons of unionism.
Officers for this year are: Jon Gaston,
President; John Fitzjohn, Vice-President;
James Stevens, Treasurer; and Phillip
Rice, Secretary.
Alpha Pi Mu
Alpha Pi Mu, industrial engineering
honorary, was chartered in 1957 to con-
fer recognition on IE majors who have
shown exceptional academic interests and
who fulfil certain ethical, social, and
character requirements.
Each November and April new mem-
bers are chosen from the upper quarter
of the Junion class or the upper third
of the senior class.
During the past year one of the groups
main efforts was to improve student-
faculty relationships within the IE De-
partment through a series of coffee hours.
The officers of this year are: Roger
Dalton, President; David Maguire, Vice-
President; R. Tom Jones, Secretary; and
Ascher Eckerling, Treasurer.
S.A.E.
The aim of the student chapter of the
Society of Automotive Engineers is to
help prepare engineering students for
their future role in industry. This goal
is accomplished mainly through talks by
professional engineers on subjects of cur-
rent interest and problems the student
will meet in industry.
Membership, which is open to all en-
gineering students, brings to the student
all advantages that come to senior mem-
bers of the society including all meetings
and tours sponsored by the parent society
as well as a subscription to the SAE
Journal. On the local level most of the
meetings are held in conjunction with
the A.S.M.E. and are known as Mechani-
cal Engineering Club functions.
The student chairman for this year is
Leonard Muller.

More than top quality in valves was required
for this $17,000,000 aluminum-and-glass
building, completed in April 1958 to provide
offices for the Cleveland Electric Illuminat-
ing Company and other industrial and com-

would last for the building's lifetime, the build-
ers sought assurance that a close delivery date
would be met.
Both were assured by the choice of Jenkins
Valves for all plumbing, heating and air con-
ditioning lines.
For almost a century the name JENKINS has
meant enduring quality. Jenkins Valves in

By educating young civil engineers in
aspects of the profession not found in
the classroom the American Society of
Civil Engineers fulfill it's purpose of act-
ing as a stepping stone into the profes-
sional world.
Meeting twice a month the program
usually consists of a talk by a prominent
person on some civil engineering topic.
The officers for this year are: William

Paul Gogulsi, Secretary.
AIEE-IRE
The American Institute of Electrical
Engineers and the Institute of Radio En-
gineers are organizations which promote
programs to aid students and graduates
in EE to keep abreast of the latest de-
velopments in their profession.
The joint student branch of the AIEE-
IRE sponsors lectures by many outstand-
ing men in the field during the school
year, as well as field trips to various in-
dustries.
Weekly student-faculty luncheons for
the EE's with technical and non-tech
films are another service of the local
student branch.
I.A.S.
The Institute of the Aeronautical
Sciences is the representative society for
engineers, scientists, designers and tech-
nical specialists in all the aspects re-
lated to the science of flight and the
design of airborne craft. Its basic mis-
sion is to facilitate by all available means
the interchange of technical ideas among
aeronautical engineers throughout the
world.
As a student member, one will find
that the IAS is eager to contribute to his
professional advancement ... by pro-
moting his knowledge of aero sciences
... by encouraging professional con-
sciousness and fellowship . . . and most
of all by helping him to establish a
solid foundation upon which he will
form and build his career in the years to
come.
ASTE
The American Society of Tool Engi-
neers exists solely for the professional
benefit of its student members. Toward
this aim, a group of programs of tech-
nical interest are being planned for this
year. Last year the dominating topic was
automation.
The second important function of any
student professional society is to help you
to meet your instructors on an informal
social. This is well implemented by
weekly luncheons, where, around a re-
laxed atmosphere of hot soup and sand-
wiches and generally a movie or talk by
a faculty member, students can meet and
talk with their instructors on topics of
common interest.
S.A.M.
The University Chapter of the Society
for the Advancement of Management is
dedicated to helping provide better
preparation for the positions in this field
and to assist in the transition from col-
lege to industry.
The program for S.A.M. this year in-
cludes speakers from industry who cover
general industrial problems as well as
specific cases. Seminars held by leaders
in their field provide further valuable
experience in solving management prob-
lems.
Members of S.A.M. enjoy the benefits
of frequent contact with industrial
leaders as well as with fellow students
with similar interests and goals. In addi-
tion to offering these contacts S.A.M.
makes an active effort to assist its mem-
bers in finding positions.
Officers for this year are: Richard C.

Where will
the '59 Graduate


Industry's demand for capable graduates in the fields of science and
engineering is still exceeding the supply produced by American colleges
and universities. As a result, the most promising members of this year's
class may well wind up with a number of openings to consider.
In such circumstances, who would blame a bright young man for at
least letting the phrase "eeny, meeny, miny, mo" slip through his mind!
Of course, there is one inescapable conclusion to be considered: open-
ings are one thing, genuine opportunities quite another. Thoughtful
examination of such factors as potential growth, challenge, advance-
ment policy, facilities, degree of self-direction, permanence, and
benefits often indicates that real opportunity does not yet grow
on trees.
Moreover, the great majority of personal success stories are
still being written by those who win positions with the
most successful companies.

turer, please write to Mr. Richard L. Auten,

pseudo-stereophonic, sound is recorded

hear a speaker, located on the right side

on the left is heard from the left.
Special-effects speakers located through-
out the auditorium are sometimes used
to reproduce the sound of waterfalls,
overhead airplanes, etc.

Fox Films are now producing most
of their CinemaScope pictures with so-
called MagOptical sound tracks. The
prime advantage of MagOptical sound,
which amounts to little more than optical
and magnetic sound tracks on the same
film, is that exhibitors need not change
their sound reproduction systems so
often. Although most exhibitors are
equipped to use magnetic sound tracks,
which are better than optical sound
tracks, it is advantageous for then to
have the optical sound track available
of the same film to use as a stand-by if
they should happen to have trouble with
their magnetic sound reproduction sys-
tems.
Hollywood's attempt to produce more
realistic pictures has not been without
problems. There have been three micro-

Photography and x-rays pointed
the way for Goodrich-Gulf
Chemicals Inc. to achieve a
synthetic that matches natural
rubber.
Heavy-duty truck and airplane tires
always had to have tree rubber to
assure acceptable performance.
Usual man-made rubber didn't
quite fill the bill. Its molecules didn't
hang together like natural rubber.
But now Goodrich-Gulf scientists,
using x-ray diffraction photographs
to check molecular structure, have
produced Ameripol SN, a man-made
rubber with the same physical prop-
erties as crude rubber even to tack
and stickiness. It's an achievement
that can mean a source of supply for
the nation's new-rubber needs.
Playing a part in research like this
is only one of the many ways photog-
raphy is working for business and
industry today. In addition, it also
delves into problems of product
design, production, and quality con-
trol. It trains employees, dealers and
salesmen—does a selling job right
to the consumer.
Photography is saving time and
cutting costs for all kinds of busi-
nesses, large and small alike. It
works for you in whatever occupa-
tion you choose.

Where do you find better advancement
opportunities—in a large company or a
smalt one? To help you, the college
student, resolve that problem, Mr. Abbott
answers the following questions con-
cerning advancement opportunities in
engineering, manufacturing and tech-
nical marketing at General Electric.
Q. In a large Company such as General
Electric, how can you assure that every
man deserving of recognition will get it?
Don't some capable people become lost?
A. No, they don't. And it's be-
cause of the way G.E. has been
organized. By decentralizing into
more than a hundred smaller oper-
ating departments, we've been able
to pinpoint both authority and re-
sponsibility. Our products are engi-
neered, manufactured and marketed
by many departments comparable
to small companies. Since each is
completely responsible for its success
and profitability, each individual
within the department has a defined
share of that responsibility. There-
fore, outstanding performance is
readily recognized.
Q. If that's the case, are opportunities
for advancement limited to openings
within the department?
A. Not at all. That's one of the
advantages of our decentralized
organization. It creates small oper-
ations that individuals can "get their
arms around", and still reserves and
enhances the inherent advantages of
a large company. Widely diverse
opportunities and promotions are
available on a Company-wide basis.
Q. But how does a department find the
best man. Company-wide?
A. We've developed personnel reg-
isters to assure that the best quali-
fied men for the job are not over-
looked. The registers contain com-

Company: How it Works
plete appraisals of professional em-
ployees. They enable a manager to
make a thorough and objective
search of the entire General Electric
Company and come up with the
man best qualified for the job.
Q. How do advancement opportunities
for technical graduates stack-up with
those of other graduates?
A. Very well. General Electric is
recognized as a Company with out-
standing technical skills and facili-
ties. One out of every thirteen em-
ployees is a scientist or engineer.
And approximately 50 per cent of
our Department General Managers
have technical backgrounds.
Q. How about speed of advancement?
Is G.E. a "young man's Company"?
A. Definitely. A majority of all
supervisors, managers and outstand-
ing individual contributors working
in the engineering function are below
the age of forty. We believe that a
job should be one for which you are
qualified, but above all it should be
one that challenges your ability. As
you master one job we feel that
consideration should be given to
moving you to a position of greater
responsibility. This is working, for
in the professional field, one out of
four of our people are in positions of
greater responsibility today than
they were a year ago.
Q. Some men want to remain in a
specialized technical job rather than go
into managerial work. How does this
affect their advancement?
A. At G.E. there are many paths
which lead to higher positions of
recognition and prestige. Every man
is essentially free to select the course
which best fits both his abilities and
interests. Furthermore, he may mod-
ify that course if his interests change
as his career progresses. Along any
of these paths he may advance
within the Company to very high
levels of recognition and salary.
Q. What aids to advancement does
General Electric provide?
A. We believe that it's just sound
business policy to provide a stimu-
lating climate for personal develop-
ment. As the individual develops,
through his own efforts, the Com-
pany benefits from his contributions.
General Electric has done much to
provide the right kind of opportu-
nity for its employees. Outstanding
college graduates are given graduate
study aid through the G-E Honors
Program and Tuition Refund Pro-
gram. Technical graduates entering
the Engineering, Manufacturing, or
Technical Marketing Programs start
with on-the-job training and related
study as preparation for more re-
sponsible positions. Throughout
their G-E careers they receive fre-
quent appraisals as a guide for self
development. Company-conducted
courses are offered again at all
levels of the organization. These
help professionals gain the increas-
ingly higher levels of education
demanded by the complexities of
modern business. Our goal is to see
every man advance to the full limits
of his capabilities.

CHANGING THE ELEMENTS — page 18




Did you ever hear
atoms move?
The physicist positions a single crystal of age-hardened
steel under the sharp diamond penetrator. He touches
a pedal, and the pyramidal tip of the diamond squeezes into
the polished surface of the steel.
The instant that it touches, things begin to happen inside
the crystal. Atoms begin to slip and slide, in layers. Some
layers abruptly wrinkle and corrugate. If you listen hard when
this happens, you hear a faint, sharp "click." This is the
sound of atoms suddenly shifting within the crystal.
You can see the action, too — or, rather, the results of it.

By studying these patterns, and correlating the information
with other data, scientists at U. S. Steel are trying to learn
what happens atomically when a steel is bent, flexed or
broken. Secrets thus learned are helping us to develop new
and better steels not only for everyday products, but also for
missiles, rockets, submarines, and other intricate machines
to explore the universe above and the world below us.

WHAT CAN A FISH BOWL TELL? The tiny plants and
this "fish bowl" will be similar to those that grew in
that grow in
fifty million
years ago and more. The aim of this experiment is to add to man's knowl-
edge of where to look for oil deposits. Pictured is Dr. F. G. Stehli.

HAY FEVER SUFFERERS may be interested to know that
pollen is helpful—in the search for oil, that is. Here
Dr. A. T. Cross studies traces of pollen in rock millions
of years old to interpret underground formations. A
comparatively new science, this study of ancient pollen
opens previously explored areas to new examination.
THE SEARCH FOR OIL goes on in some of the most
inaccessible regions in the world. And expensive,
specially-built equipment like this "swamp buggy" is
needed to overcome the obstacles of nature and to find
more new oil every year than is taken out of the ground.

Time turned back 50 million years;
Scientists seek new clues to oil!
Tiny marine plants and animals, very like those living when dinosaurs roamed the
earth, are being grown today in a research laboratory.
In glass containers similar to fish bowls, scientists of Pan American Petroleum
Corporation, a Standard Oil affiliate, have transplanted sand and sea water from
an ocean shore line. Then, by controlling temperature, pressure and salt content,
they have simulated the environment of plants and animals that grew 50 to 300
million years ago.
The chemical composition of the microscopic life that grows in the laboratory
will offer more positive clues to the type of environment of ancient fossils; that is,
whether the tiny animals lived and died in deep, shallow, or protected water.
This knowledge will help scientists to map ancient seas with greater accuracy,
to pinpoint the location of prehistoric shore lines and barrier reefs where conditions
were ideal for oil to form. Such knowledge will improve our ability to find oil in
sufficient quantities to meet today's steadily increasing needs.
This is another example of the way research
works at Standard and its affiliates to discover
quicker, surer methods of finding oil, to keep
the supply up and the price down.
As the result of such trail-blazing research
work as the fish bowl project, America's proved
underground reserves have grown larger, prices
have remained reasonable, and America has
been assured of an adequate supply to keep its
defenses strong.
What makes a company a good citiien? One
measure is a company's concern for the welfare
of future generations. In our business, a "let-
tomorrow-take-carc-of-itself" attitude would be
disastrous. Through research, we at Standard
are working to make life more comfortable and
secure for all—today and for the future.

The recent acts of violence and ignorance in our South
have brought to the attention of many of us the need for
anti-discriminatory efforts in the United States. Many of
us are appalled, even shocked, at some of the occurrences
in Dixie. A series of acts, just as wrong in a moral or
ethical sense, and just as difficult to halt, are being carried
on in every corner of the U. S. by organizations very
closely knit with the engineering student—American in-
dustries. As in almost every case of prejudice and dis-
crimination in our country, the victims are usually Negro
or Jewish. Many U. S. firms will not hire a Negro college
graduate, regardless of his personal qualifications; most of
these try their best to avoid hiring Jewish persons.
The most regretful incident I have had personal con-
tact with was a letter sent to a Filipino graduate of Michi-
gan, received by him almost the day after his interview,
informing him that their company had nothing to suit
the man's interests. This was a near impossibility, since
the firm employed over 12,000 in the largest (and one
of the most diverse) single chemical plants in the country.
In talking with Professor John Young of the Engi-
neering Placement Service, I found his experience has
been along similar lines. Discrimination among industries
is widespread, especially in the salaried positions. An
alarming number of firms show the same lack of ability
and desire to remedy the situation as do Faubus &amp; Co.
However, steps are being slowly taken to break down the
barriers, raised chiefly by the hourly workers, against hiring
Negroes and Jews. One of the most effective means of
combatting discrimination in the South will come through
plant expansion there by Northern firms, for the express
purpose of using the Negro labor (and management in
some cases).
A powerful weapon against discrimination, which, be-
sides being immoral and unethical, is absolutely illegal
under the Fair Employment Practices Commission (thus
pointing out the Federal Government's view on the situ-
ation), would be letters sent directly to the personnel and
technical hiring departments of guilty firms. I doubt if
many engineers graduate from Michigan and hear of no
cases of discrimination of this nature. Companies are
sensitive to opinions of potential employees, and they
would feel a stronger compulsion to do something about
the present situation, if these anti-discriminatory opinions
were made known. Unless put under outside pressure,
some firms will continue to resist hiring Negroes for a
long time, because they fear trouble among their hourly
workers. Numerous organizations are urging these firms
to be nondiscriminatory, but more pressure is needed to
convince the management of these companies that their
policies do great harm. Action would certainly result if
the firm thought its reputation on a particular campus were
being harmed.
So, in summing up, the thing to do turns out to be just
what is needed in most other cases of discrimination—
not sitting back, but making a positive effort to tell some-
one directly that he is unfair. Too many of us take a
back seat, complain about what is going on, but somehow
never get around to doing something about it. Let's do
our share in this fight; it's going to affect each one of us
personally before it's over.

Alfred Nortk Wnitehead... on tne passion for discovery
"Disinterested scientific curiosity is a passion for
an ordered intellectual vision of tke connection of
events. But the goal of such curiosity is the
marriage of action to thought. This essential inter-
vention of action even in abstract science is often
overlooked. No man of science wants merely to
know. He acquires knowledge to appease his
passion for discovery. He does not discover in order
to know, he knows in order to discover. The pleas-
ure which art and science can give to toil is the
enjoyment which arises from successfully directed
intention. Also it is the same pleasure which is
yielded to the scientist and to the artist."

THE MAN* WITH KOPPERS
"... versatility recognized"
*Arthur Herman graduated from Johns Hopkins
in 1955 and went to work immediately in the Metal
Products Division of Koppers as a Design Engineer.
In December of the same year, he was promoted
to Supervising Engineer of the Design Section,
where he found that Koppers offers truly challeng-
ing problems in design engineering.
Then, in September 1957, Art was transferred
to the Coupling Sales Department as a Coupling
Application Engineer. He is serving in that
capacity now.
An employment record alone is seldom descrip-
tive of the opportunities and responsibilities many
positions represent. For instance, Art was recently
designated as Division Representative to investi-
gate the potentialities of a new product developed
by a European manufacturer. This assignment
took him abroad.
Art is particularly articulate about his job and
the constant challenge it presents for him as an
individual.
"When I first started as a design engineer," he
said, "I didn't realize the scope of activities in
which I'd be called on to participate. Sure, I had
good theory and background for design engineering,
but I had little concept of the problems of produc-
tion, and even less familiarity with the techniques
of sales or marketing. My work as an application
engineer gets me into almost every phase of the
business — development, production, marketing,
finance, and so forth.
"At Koppers I feel that I receive the necessary
guidance to enable me to contribute fully to the
Company's activities. I am encouraged to make
decisions. If these decisions involve factors with
which I am not entirely familiar, I can rely on the
judgment and experience of others working with
me. At all times, I feel that I have real access to
upper levels of management where my ideas have
always been received thoughtfully and given full
consideration. Now, I feel confident that I am
doing a job for Koppers, and, what is equally
important, that my associates and supervisors
understand and appreciate it, too! I have found
that through such methods as the Management
Appraisal Program, Koppers makes every effort
to recognize and reward good performance."
A lot of things could be said about Art Herman,
and the career he found at Koppers. But as the
manager to whom Art reports commented recently:
"Art's an able man . .. we're glad to have him. He
is making a real contribution to the Company.
All we in management can do is try our best to
develop a man's best qualities and, when he proves
to have the versatility that Art has, to see that
this versatility is recognized."
If you feel that this is the atmosphere in which
you would most like to build your profession and
mark your progress, write to the Manager of Man-
power Planning, Koppers Company, Inc., Pitts-
burgh 19, Pennsylvania or contact your College
Placement Director.

TO
"OLD" MATERIALS
By today's standards, the "old" refractory
metals are outdated. The ultimate in
high-temperature studies of 10 years ago
is several generations behind in terms
of modern aircraft and missile development.
Today's material requirements surpass
anything envisioned 10 short years ago.
Molybdenum and beryllium, for example,
are still exciting metals with much promise
for space vehicles and ultra-high-speed
aircraft. It now appears, however, that
the full promise of such metals may
be fulfilled when they are used, not alone,
nor as alloys, but when combined
with other materials to form totally new
types of structural materials.
Such a "marriage" of metals, ceramics
and plastics is a promising approach to
high-temperature problems that is being
vigorously pursued at Avco. It opens
new potential applications for many
exotic combinations.
These bold steps forward are possible
at Avco, where materials research includes
concurrent basic studies and applied
research, plus developmental programs that
extend through the solution of processing
and testing problems.
The search for new knowledge goes
forward simultaneously with the creation of
advanced technology at Avco's Research
and Advanced Development Division. The
creative man, whether he is interested in
basic studies or practical problems, finds his
effort enhanced by the stimulus of
interdisciplinary contact and feedback
from other related fields.
Research ami Advanced Development is
more than a descriptive title at Avco.
It is a concept that promotes creativity.

Why Lockheed -
Lockheed's leadership in aircraft is continuing in missiles. The Missile
Systems Division is one of the largest in the industry and its reputation
is attested by the number of high-priority, long-term projects it holds:
the Polaris IRBM, Earth Satellite, Kingfisher (Q-5) and the X-7.
To carry out such complex projects, the frontiers of technology in all
areas must be expanded. Lockheed's laboratories at Sunnyvale and
Palo Alto, California, provide the most advanced equipment for research
and development, including complete test facilities and one of the
most up-to-date computing centers in the nation. Employee benefits
are among the best in the industry.
For those who qualify and desire to continue their education, the
Graduate Study Program enables them to obtain M.S. or Ph.D degrees
at Stanford or the University of California, while employed in their
chosen fields at Lockheed.
Lockheed Missile Systems Division was recently honored at the first
National Missile Industry Conference as "the organization that
contributed most in the past year to the development of the art of
missiles and astronautics!'

FIBER OPTICS
Developed by U-M students, fiber optics opens
up a new visual method in fields ranging from
engineering to medicine.
by ROGER BARNES, '61E
This somewhat simple-looking ap-
paratus plays a very important
role in a field of engineering
which has greatly contributed to
medicine—fiber optics. Glass fiber
is being withdrawn from the "fur-
nace" at the bottom as the %-inch
fused rod is being fed into the
top.
The atmosphere in the hospital room
was tense. On the faces of the wait-
ing physicists was an expression of anti-
cipation mixed with one of anxiety.
The reason was that a product of their
laboratories, a new instrument capable
of allowing physicians to observe the
interior of the stomach, was being tested
for the first time. The attending physi-
cian picked up about thirty inches of
what appeared to be ordinary flexible
tubing. After it was well greased, the
"tube" was inserted in a patient's mouth
and slowly passed down his throat into
the stomach. After proper electrical con-
nections had been made, the doctor
peered into an eyepiece on the outer
end of the instrument. What he saw was
the interior of the stomach, fully illumi-
nated; by manipulation of the tube, suc-
cessive regions of the inner surface came
into view through the eyepiece.
The "tube" that was passed into the
body of the patient was actually a bundle
of minute glass fibers arranged in exactly
the same arrangement with respect to
each other at both ends, such that the
bundle had the property of transmitting
an image from one end to the other no
matter how it was bent or twisted. It
has long been known that if a light is
incident on one end of a glass or plastic
rod, the light would be reflected back
and forth between the inner walls until
it emerges at the other end. In "fiber
optics," this same principle applies also
to individual flexible fibers of glass. The
quality of the transmitted image de-
pends upon the number of fibers in the
bundle, much like the quality of a half-
tone photo is dependent upon the num-
ber of printed dots.
Michigan Contributes to Fiber Optics
Fiber optics was first conceived back
in the 1920's by several persons almost
at the same time, but its development
was not pursued until the last five years.
At that time, Professor H. H. Hopkins
of the University of London (one of
the original inventors), resurrected the
idea and challenged one of his students
to investigate its possibilities. This stu-
dent was Dr. Narinder S. Kapany who
today is supervisor of optics research at
the Armour Research Foundation of the
Illinois Institute of Technology. Through
his effort, the true development of fiber

optics began. In the fall of 1955, a
University of Michigan undergraduate,
Lawrence E. Curtiss, undertook a study
of the feasibility of fiber optics in medi-
cal instruments for the Department of
Internal Medicine of the University
Hospital. Under the supervision of Pro-
fessor Peters of the Physics Department,
Curtiss developed and constructed an in-
strument known as a fiber optical gastro-
scope which could be passed into the
body so that the interior of the stomach
could be observed.
Such a flexible tube, as developed by
Curtiss, has many potentialities. Previ-
ously, in order to observe the interior
of the stomach, a pipe containing many
lenses was pushed down into the stom-
ach. With that type of instrument, only
the lower end was flexible, and even
this had a very limited freedom. On the
other hand, with fibers, the tube bends
to conform with the contours of the
throat and mouth. Moreover, the tip
on the lower end has high mobility, and
is able to illuminate and transmit pic-
tures of every square inch of the inner
lining of the stomach.
Three Main Components
The flexible gastroscope is not as com-
plex an instrument as the conventional
instrument. The latter often required
several dozen lenses accurately placed in
the pipe to transmit the image up from
the lower end. With the flexible instru-
ment there are three main sections: a
metal tip containing tiny electrical lamps
and a movable lens to focus an image
of stomach lining onto the end of the
fiber bundle; the fiber bundle that car-
ries the picture from the stomach to the
exterior; and an eye lens to view the
transmitted picture.
Roughly y2 inch in diameter and iy2
inches long, the rounded metal tip houses
the lamp to illuminate the interior of
the stomach and a prism and lens to
transmit the image onto the end of the
fiber bundle. See Figure 1. In this cross
section of the tip, the lamp is visible
at point A behind the prism. Light from
this source passes through the aperture
and onto the surface at point B. The
image is reflected back to the aperture

arrangement, is examined.
but is reflected again at 90 degrees by
the face of the prism at point C. A
small lens below the prism at point D
focuses the image on the end of the
fiber bundle at point E.
The fiber bundle is also about y2
inches in diameter and about thirty inches
long, the length necessary to reach down
into the stomach of the average basket-
ball player. Each individual fiber that
was used in Curtiss's gastroscope is about
.0015 inches in diameter. There are a
total of 40,000 individual fibers which
is about 250 miles of total length of
fiber. Actually about 2500 miles of fiber
was necessary to obtain a perfect bundle.
Each fiber isolates a part of the image
that is transmitted through the lens,
and conveys it to the other end of the
tube. If precisely the same relative ar-
rangement of the fibers is at each end,
the light will be released at the far end
with the same distribution of intensities
that existed in the image focused on the
lower end.
Three layers of protective material
surround the fiber bundle. The first and
closest to the fibers is a helix of spring
steel that permits bending yet is rigid
enough to be pushed down the throat.
A rubber tube next surrounds the pack-
age and is used to protect the fibers
from stomach juices and saliva. Finally,
a special latex rubber tube covers the
bundle. Air may be pumped down in-
side this tube to dilate the stomach.
When the gastroscope is being used, it
is well greased to allow the tube to pass
with a minimum of friction. Also, along
with the fibers in the bundle are wires
connected to the lamps in the metal tip.
Problem of Transmission Quality
Among the problems encountered by
those developing the flexible gastroscope
and also those engaged in the research
of fiber optics is the loss of trans-

igan, inspects the drum onto which the

mission quality. Even though the glass
fiber should ideally reflect internal light
rays and transmit them to the other end
without any loss of quality, there is some
light that leaks out of a fiber at each
reflection. This is largely due to minute
specks of foreign matter (dirt, etc.) on
the surface of the fiber. Since the aver-
age ray is reflected back and forth many
thousands of time before getting from
one end to the other, this reflection loss
is multiplied many times and becomes a
very serious problem indeed. There is
also considerable loss of contrast due to
the leakage of light rays from one fiber
to another that touches it.
It was found that both of the prob-
lems could be effectively eliminated by
using fibers consiting of a high refrac-
tive index glass core with a .0001 inch
coating of low refractive index glass
fused around it. The outer coating not
only acts as a spacer to prevent the cores
from touching and exchanging light rays,

but also as an insulator preserving a
permanently clean surface of the core.
Besides the distinct advantage of the
fiber bundle being flexible, the bundle
can also accept light from a larger solid
angle than the conventional gastroscope.

multiple-lensed instrument has one of

in intensity and permits routine color
photography in the stomach.
Improvement of Refineness
Among some of the companies now
conducting research and development in
the field of fiber optics are Bausch and
Lomb Optical Company, the company
which made up the first fiber bundles for
Kapany; the American Optical Company;
and the American Gastroscope Makers,
Inc. Though the greatest use of the
principle of fiber optics will be in the
flexible imaging of relatively inaccessible
areas such as the stomach, it is also to
be applied to high speed photography,
television, the determination of the re-
fractive index of liquids, and in crytog-
raphy or coding.
Thus the major advances that began
in medical technology in that hospital
room will spread into many areas as a
result of the research and development
propagated by such students as Kapany
and Curtiss that are fascinated by its
possibilities.

Changing the elements, only a dream in the
past, is a reality in this modern age.
by CARL PAGE, '60E
The alchemists of centuries past strug-
gled to produce gold from mercury
with a strange mixture of mysticism and
practical chemistry. What they did not
know was that their cause was hopeless.
For it is well known today that gold
and mercury differ because they are ele-
ments: no amount of chemical manipu-
lation can change one into the other.
Chemical manipulation changes the re-
lationship between the individual atoms
and affects the electrons of the atoms.
Before one can perform the transmuta-
tion of one element into another, one
must ignore the outer electrons and probe
the heart of atomic structure—the nu-
cleus.
It is an interesting paradox of eco-
nomics that now when science and tech-
nology have reached the level where
some gold could be transmuted from
mercury, exactly the opposite is economi-
cally desirable. For ordinary mercury is
a mixture of different isotopes of mer-
cury. (Isotopes of elements have the
same number of protons but different
numbers of neutrons. For example, the
isotopes of hydrogen are: ordinary hydro-
gen with one proton in the nucleus,
deuterium, with one proton and one neu-
tron in the nucleus, and tritium, with
one proton and two neutrons in the
nucleus.) And since mercury is a mix-
ture of different isotopes, when it is
heated the spectral lines of the substance
become superimposed, an undesirable
property called fine structure. However,
mercury produced from one specific nu-
clear reaction is only of one isotope.
Therefore, some mercury has been made
from gold for the analysis of the mer-
cury spectrum.
A nuclear reaction, analogous to a
chemical reaction can be written for the
transmutation of gold into mercury. In
the reaction below, note that the sub-
scripts denote atomic number and that
the superscripts denote atomic weights.
A neutron represented as "on1" and an
electron as "_4e°" are also involved in the
reaction:
79Au197 + ()n' -h&gt; 79Au198 -&gt;
s„Hg"J8 + _,e°
Because of the conservation of charge,
the sum of the atomic numbers on the
left is equal to the sum of the atomic
numbers on the right. And because of
the conservation of mass number, the
sum of the atomic weights on the left
are equal to the sum of the atomic
weights on the right.
The spontaneous transmutation of the
atoms of one element into the atoms of
another element is as old as the universe
itself. But it passed undiscovered until
1896 when Henry Bacquerel observed
the clouding of photographic plates due
to radioactivity. The atoms of a radio-
active material are unstable. At any
time there is a certain probability that
any atom may eject charged particles
from its nucleus, changing its nuclear
charge and hence becoming the atom of
another element.
Artificial Transmutations
But radioactivity is a decay reaction.
Stable atoms, atoms with little chance
of decaying by themselves, can be trans-
muted by bombarding them with vari-
ous sub-atomic particles. A natural source
of radioactivity like radium can be used
to bombard other elements, or a host of
devices which have been constructed for
this purpose can be used. Devices which
give charged particles more energy are
the betatrons, Van de Graff electrostatic
generators, cyclotrons, and linear acceler-
ators. The reader is referred to any ele-
mentary college physics text for the in-
teresting details of their operation. In
recent years, nuclear reactors have made
available intense sources of neutrons,
gamma rays and neutrinos.
Rutherford performed the first arti-
ficial transmutation in 1919 when he

oxygen of atomic weight 17. The ex-
periment was accompanied by the dis-
covery of particles which appeared as the
nitrogen was bombarded with alpha par-
ticles; later they were called protons and
found to be hydrogen nuclei. The ex-
periment can be expressed symbolically:
7N" + „HeJ -» H017 + 1H1
A transmutation reaction performed
by Joliot Curie and Chadwick produced
a formerly unknown particle. It was about
the same mass as the proton and had no
charge, hence it was given the name
'"neutron." In the experiment, beryllium
was transmuted into carbon with alpha
particles. Neutrons and gamma rays were
detected as products:
4Be8 + 2He&lt; _» 6C» + ji* + „/
The symbol "0-y°" stands for the gamma
photons.
There are many ways in which a nu-
cleus can be broken up by a subatomic
particle. Let us consider five common
types in order to gain some idea of the
type of reactions one might expect. Using
the conservation of charge and the con-
servation of mass number, for any given
bombardment one may predict the prod-
uct as long as only one product is formed.
Comparatively low energy alpha parti-
cles or helium nuclei will "stick" in the
nuclei of some atoms, increasing their
atomic weight by four and charge by two.
For example, lithium can be changed into
boron:
,Li' + 2He' -» (BB") -» 5B" + 0y&gt;
The gamma rays on the right are emitted
as the product nuclei assume more stable
configurations.
Protons make excellent nuclear "bul-
lets" when suitably energized, causing
many strange nuclear reactions. Lithium
splits in two in this reaction after ab-
sorbing a proton:
sLi' + 1H' -&gt; (4BE8) -&gt;
,He« + ,,HE'
However, it may have an intermediate
step, releasing a high energy photon:
8Li" + ,H&gt; -» 4Be8 + 0/
The Be8 formed is unstable and decays
naturally in a fantistically short time.
Its half life is only about 2 X 10 14
seconds which means that half of it
decays in about 2 hundred-trillionths of
a second.
Deutrons also cause severe changes in
nuclear structure, and like protons and
alpha particles, different changes in the
same nucleus. When carbon is bom-
barded by deutrons, two reactions have
been observed:
6C" + ,H* -&gt; (7N») -&gt; ,;C13 + 1H&gt;
6C» + -&gt; (TN") -+ ,N» -|- 0n'
In a process called pbolodisintegration
photons can disintegrate nuclei causing
transmutations. The process causes the
reactant nucleus to absorb the photon
and usually emit a neutron to a lower
energy state:
.H» + „/ -» (,H=) -&gt; tH» + on1
High energy gamma ray photons or x-ray
photons of enough energy will trigger
this reaction.
Since the neutron is uncharged, it is
not repelled by electrostatic forces as
are the proton, deutron, and alpha par-
ticle. A reaction which is exactly the
reverse of the previous example has been
obscerved:
,H' + 0n&gt; -&gt; (,») -&gt; + oy°
Bombarding heavy nuclei with neutrons
usually causes them to form radioactive
isotopes. Such isotopes of almost any
element are now available as invaluable
tools of the chemist, biologist, and physi-
ologist. Much work has been done using
the radioactive isotopes of carbon, so-
dium, iron, phosporus and iodine as
tracers.
Energy Transmutations
An important special type of transmu-
tation is the fission of Uranium. It is
important not for the end products of
the transmutation but for the tremendous
amounts of energy available from the
process. Most transmutations require ex-
ternal energy to keep them going but
in the decay of 92U23r' it is possible to
have a chain-reaction. For a single neu-
tron is required to start the fission or
splitting of an atom of 92U235. After it
splits two or three new neutrons are
released. The new neutrons have a cer-
tain chance of splitting other nuclei in
the uranium and continuing the process,
and they have a certain chance of miss-
ing all the uranium atoms and being lost
from the process. If the "chunk" of

EXECUTIVE
With many young engineers aiming for man-
agement positions someday, a Chrysler Cor-
poration specialist on executive development
tells what is expected of the rising young
executive. by WILLIAM C. PORTER
Idon't know of any subject that is
more alive throughout industry to-
day than the development of men for
executive positions.
Each day brings more and more com-
plications to every business, and as a
result the need of more men at the
executive level has become quite acute.
The complex problems have simply be-
come too many and too varied for a few
men at the top to handle efficiently.
Twenty or even fifteen years ago the
idea of executive development would
have been refused by most corporations.
The concept of a few men at the top of
each organization making all of the
executive decisions was still very popular
and considering the state of business at
that time still very effective.
Anyone suggesting executive develop-
ment fifteen years ago would have been
marked as a free thinker, a man who
lacked the understanding of how to run
a business.
Since World War II the philosophy
of developing men for executive posi-
tions has to a very general degree been
accepted. Executives in every industry
have seen the necessity of training men
for general management responsibilities.
The decisions to adopt an executive
development program were made, not
only because of the greater complexity
in running and managing a large busi-
ness but there were other reasons for
these decisions.
Men holding general management
positions at the time immediately follow-
ing the war began to worry about their
successors. These executives had worked
hard to build and create and maintain
a good business and they wanted to insure
a continuing success. They believed that
this could be done in part at least by
developing men to take over their re-
sponsibilities so that there would be a
smooth transition between changes in
managers.
Other people were interested in con-
tinuing good management. The em-
ployees, the stockholders, the banks, and
Wall Street became very concerned about
the men who would take up the reins of
responsibility in industry.
On the other hand, if it wasn't only
a problem of replacing executives who
were about to retire, the problem of
expansion entered the picture. Younger
executives were concerned about the tre-
mendous load of responsibility already
placed on the executives. They realized
that if they expanded their facilities, new
executives must be developed to take
over the new and additional responsi-
bilities.
For these basic reasons the need for
systematic development of men for gen-
eral management positions became clear
and thus the study on industry's part
as to how to develop men for executive
positions was started.
Now, perhaps I should define a gen-
eral management or executive position.
An Executive Example
An individual enters the area of gen-
eral management when his actions and
responsibilities have a positive bearing
on the responsibilities and actions of
other individuals.
Because you are all interested in Engi-
neering, let us take an Engineering
example.
In automotive engineering there are
two basic design groups, the Body De-
sign Section and the Chassis Design
Section.
In order to be more specific in our
example, let us take the case of a Body
Engineer working on the design of a
front grille. This engineer is given a
specific problem and told the limits
within which he must work. He is told
how wide the grille can be, how high
the grille can be, and how deep the grille
may be designed. This individual's ac-
tions and responsibilities are specific and
limited. The problem of fitting the grille
between the fenders and being sure that
there is adequate clearance between the
grill and radiator is not a responsibility
of this Body Design Engineer.
But the man who assigned this par-
ticular problem to the Body Design En-
gineer is at the beginning stage of
general management responsibility. He
had to be concerned with the problem
of fitting this grille between the fenders
and being sure that there was sufficient
space between the grille and the radiator.
As we go on up the line of manage-
ment we find these decisions becoming
more and more difficult and having
greater and more far reaching effects.
At the top of the Body Design Sec-
tion is the Chief Body Engineer who
must coordinate the actions of all his
20
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


the Engineering Division and the Corpo-
ration. He must be concerned not only
with the actual design problems, his
specific and technical area, but he must
be concerned and have a deep under-
standing of production methods and
costs, of the sales advantages, and of the
financial advantages.
This Chief Body Engineer has moved
to a position of true general manage-
ment responsibility.
These positions then, the positions
above the local and isolated problems
are the positions industry needs to de-
velop men for.
It is not enough that the Vice Presi-
dent in charge of Engineering knows
his area alone, he must understand the
problems of production, fiinance, sales
and industrial relations.
Much has been said and volumes have
been written regarding engineers in exec-
utive positions.
There is a tremendous volume of
evidence today that engineers make good
general managers. At Chrysler, for in-
stance, two out of four major division
presidents are graduate engineers.
Another example is American Brake
Shoe: out of 25 top positions in this
corporation, 15 are held by graduate
engineers.
In almost any industry, you will find
engineers holding a fair share of the
general management positions.
The question naturally follows—why
then are we so concerned and why is
so much thought being given as to how
an engineer can prepare himself for an
executive responsibility?
Why Failures?
With all the evidence pointing to the
fact that engineers make good executives,
there is one disturbing point, and that is
too many engineers in the general man-
agement area have failed.
Perhaps the best way to search for
a means of success in achieving execu-
tive positions will be to study the reason
engineers have failed. It has been my
experience to see top-notch engineers
enter industry with every possible fact
pointing to a successful climb up the
ladder. These young engineers have
come from good schools, many of them
Tau Beta Pi men. Their start in industry
has been unusually fast, technical respon-
sibilities have been handed them in rapid
succession.
But suddenly this brilliant young engi-
neer is faced with something foreign to
his nature and his education. A non-
logical problem is injected into his life—
this is a problem of people.
The young engineer's entire back-
ground has taught him to think with
synthetic orderliness. His education has
demanded this approach and his nature
has adopted it.
But what is orderly about a human
being? How can this engineer be orderly
in coordinating the responsibilities and
efforts of other people? The engineer's
training has been to apply a certain set
of formulae to a given set of problems,
and has been able to prove his results
because of his orderly approach to these
problems.
But the human is not orderly and
what will work for one individual will
not work for another.
If the engineer dips a piece of metal
into one solution it reacts in a certain
way. In dipping another piece of the
same metal into the same solution, it
will give the same reaction, but by treat-
ing one person one way a certain reaction
is achieved and treating another person
the same way a different reaction is
achieved.
I would like to quote from William
B. Given, Jr., whose article "The Engi-
neer Goes Into Management" appeared
in the January-February issue of this
year in the Harvard Business Review:
"Contrast the background of those
who are trained in the exact sciences,
such as physics and thermodynamics,
with that of those who are trained
in the humanities. Here is how one
of our younger executives put it:
'Those who major in the humani-
ties deal to a iarge extent with
opinions. Who knows what Chaucer
or Shakespeare had in mind? Every-
one has an opinion, but no one
knows for a fact. However, every
engineer knows what Boyle had in
mind and, furthermore can prove it.
This training can be helpful in some
areas of executive decision, because
once the facts are established, many
questions answer themselves. But it
is far from helpful in the most im-
portant area of executive decision—
dealing wth people.'"
In studying the reasons for engineers'
failures in general management, this is
(he most common one.
There are other road blocks in the
path of the engineer. The engineer can
become too wrapped up in his work.
The scientific details that mean so much
in overcoming technical problems tend
to weight the engineer down to a point
that he forgets many of the necessary
social amenities. He loses track of his
people and forgets that they need more
constant attention if they are to be kept
functioning properly than any piece of
scientific equipment.
Executive Development
Now for a moment let's look at what
industry has done to develop men for
executive positions.
Naturally I am most familiar with the
Chrysler plan for management and execu-
tive development, and very briefly I would

the
NUCLEAR REACTOR
With nuclear reactors being put to more and
more use everyday the problem of controlling
their operations safely but efficiently is of prime
importance. by M. A. SCHULTZ
Nuclear-power-plant control philos-
ophy in this country is primarily
concerned with over-all safety. The
science has not yet progressed to the point
at which efficiency and economics can
be introduced as prime factors. Conse-
quently, in a climate of preoccupation
with safety, the control-system designer
quickly finds himself enmeshed in prob-
lems of basic reactor-design philosophy.
Choice of Reactor
The first problem to be resolved is
what type of reactor shall be built. This
question is usually answered on an eco-
nomic, political or other basis, but there
is also a distinct control-philosophy ques-
tion involved.
The argument develops as follows:
The processes involved in a reactor are
dangerous and, consequently, some con-
trol is needed to operate safely. A power
reactor produces heat. Moveover the heat
must be produced in a slow and steady
manner to be useful.
We can consider here two types of
reactors—inherently stable and inherently
unstable.
External Control
One reactor-design school, first cham-
pioned by Canadian engineers, feels that
nuclear power plants should follow the
pattern of simple reactors with complex
external control. Its argument is, "Re-
actor economics are admittedly poor.
The designer has a tough enough prob-
lem in attempting to design a cheap,
economical reactor without the added
restriction that the reactor must protect
itself. Call on the control engineer to
protect the reactor by means of external
devices.
"Positive temperature coefficients
should be permitted and any economic
grouping of materials should be allowed.
Circuitry is now available to ensure com-
plete protection."
This philosophy usually calls for a
large number of scrams or shutdown
circuits in the control system. Some re-
actors have hundreds of scram circuits.
Internal Control
The alternative philosophy starts by
restricting reactor design to a stable con-
figuration. This is currently used in the
United States and Britain. Many possible
reactor types probably will not be per-
mitted despite the apparent present desire
to try every approach in this country.
This philosophy means a moderate-to-
large negative temperature or void co-
efficient for the reactor and a restriction
to compatible materials.
The question is, "Does restricting the
reactor design to one that can protect
itself necessarily mean a more expensive
core and plant?"
It has been shown that for some re-
actor types, such as pressurized-water or
boiling water, the safety provided by a
large negative coefficient is essentially
free. Changes to alter the temperature
coefficient to an optimum value can be
made by comparatively slight material
proportion changes in the fuel-to-mod-
erator ratio.
Some reactors can be made to protect
themselves simply and cheaply against
most accidents. Other conceivable acci-
dents may then require a minimum of
external circuitry, possibly only one or
two scram circuits. Therefore, there ap-
pear to be reactor designs and confuta-
tions that offer economic performance,
along with low-cost built-in internal pro-
tection. However, the freedom of design
provided by sophisticated external control
systems is most appealing.
Cost Factors
Once the reactor type is chosen, more
detailed concern can be given to the
cost of the safety control system. From
the viewpoint of the reactor builder, the
principal ingredients of plant safety are:
1. Protection of the plant by proper
design of reliable instrumentation and
control systems—not necessarily by mul-
tiple instruments or over-control.
2. Protection of the general public
after an accident by containment.
In most power reactors in this country,
containment appears to be a necessity.
Sufficient experience is not yet available
in power-reactor operation to consider
abandoning containment in complete
favor of better instrumentation design.
A few voices have arisen that this ap-
proach should now be considered and a

external controls is met. This block-
diagram represents the interconnected
loops; startup, operating, and shutdown,
each of which must be designed accord-
ing to technical and economic specifi-
cations.
reasonable risk taken, but clearly more
experience with operation is needed.
Now if it is granted that a foreseeable
accident creates a statistically intolerable
situation to the surrounding neighbor-
hood, no major reduction in reactor
safety costs can presently be made. The
cost of the containment system far out-
weighs the dollar value of any economic
argument on detailed control-system
philosophy.
Control Approaches
We can now look at choices available
in working out the basic control system.
It is assumed that reactor type has been
selected, its nuclear characteristics are
known, and the transfer function giving
performance as a control component has
been determined. External-control design
is then started. Figure 1 is a representa-
tion of the problem in block-diagram
form showing this system as three inter-
connected loops—startup, operating and
shutdown loops. These networks clearly
have the reactor as a common component
and can have other external intercon-
nections.
Each block of Fig. 1 requires a philo-
sophic choice in its conception. Presum-
ably most of these choices can now be
made on a technical or economic basis.
Startup
In the startup loop the choice must
immediately be made as to whether this
loop shall be manual or automatic in
the blocks marked "amplifier" and "actu-
ators." Automatic startup of a reactor
is completely feasible on a technical basis
and some reactors are already using auto-
matic or semiautomatic startup.
The problem can be resolved on an
economic basis, and operating costs and
local labor conditions will probably pre-
vail in the decision. For example, a
power reactor used in a submarine prob-
ably has no great need of automatic
startup in that there is a ready supply
of labor available for reactor operation
at no extra cost. On the other hand, in

a complex electrical generating plant in
a large city with an expensive labor
market, considerable automation can be
written off against operating costs.
Nuclear instrumentation. The next
choice is how much instrumentation in
the block designated "neutron de-
tectors" must be provided. In early
power-reactor designs, excess nuclear in-
strumentation was furnished for extreme
safety. It was felt that nuclear instru-
mentation, being new, would not be very
reliable, and to provide a reactor plant
with just one channel of neutron infor-
mation would be foolhardy.
This argument very quickly raised the
argument against using two channels:
With the same poor instrumentation the
question arose as to which channel should
be believed. Consequently, three-channel
instrumentation was installed in several
plants, and if any two channels read
alike, these are presumed to be correct.
Nuclear instrumentation has proved
to be as reliable as any other type and
perhaps even more so because of the
great emphasis and care taken in its
design. However, other subterfuges are
now being used to retain multiple-chan-
nel instrumentation. For example, the
theory of wired spares has been evolved
around the argument that no one would
operate a nuclear reactor without spare
instruments; and as long as these instru-
ments are on hand, they can as well be
stored in a cabinet; and as long as they
are stored in a cabinet, they might just
as well be wired up in operating channels.
The true situation is that the safety
picture dominates and forces the present
use of parallel nuclear instrumentation.
Despite present reliability of this ap-
paratus, a minimum of two independent
channels appears indicated for each
Plant inputs
function. Coincidence and auctioneering
type circuits no longer appear necessary.
Two independent channels, however,
have the advantage that each channel
can be checked separately even while the
plant is on the line.
Control speed. The next problem is
how fast the control devices shall oper-
ate. Here again performance as well as
safety dictates the answer, but the deci-
sion can be made on a reasonably good
technical basis. The problem of xenon
override and burnout results in one
minimum required control-device speed.
Reactor startups are also limited by
temperature and stress considerations and,
for military plants, tactics. Each reactor
has its own problems, which call for both
a minimum and a maximum required
reacivity-change rate, but quite clearly
safe startup systems can be designed
using reactivity change rates ranging
from 10"1 AVsec t0 10'5 At/sec-
Safety suggests the slower speeds.
Operating Loop
The problems of the operating loop
are accuracy as well as reliability of
output. Generators of electricity are re-
quired ultimately to supply the user with
a fixed voltage at a constant frequency.
What then are the limits to which the
reactor output must be held, and how
reliable is this new source of power to
be? The consumer is not the slighest
bit interested in the fact that a reactor
has shut down because of a bad tube in
a servo amplifier when he plugs his
toaster into the wall socket. Conse-
quently, the present trend is for operat-
ing loops to have no vacuum tubes in
key roles. Magnetic amplifiers or tran-
sistors replace them.

lator rod or a regulating form of leakage
or poison that has little reactivity worth.
General practice is to limit the reactivity
of the regulating device to a value less
than that required to go prompt critical.
However, in reactors where control rods
are combinations of shim, safety and
regulator rods, this criterion need not be
firm if the rods movely slowly.
Shutdown
The shutdown loop differs from the
others in that it normally is not work-
ing. It is used only during an accident
or malfunction and provides signals to
turn off the reactor by either scramming
or cutting back on power level. As pre-
viously indicated, the number of signals
injected into the shutdown loop is a
function of reactor resign philosophy.
The entire basis for scramming, however,
may well need to be re-examined for
future power reactors.
The scram circuit itself is a somewhat
new industrial concept. Safety devices
that turn something off in the event of
overheating are common enough in in-
dustry but differ from the scram in two
important respects—speed and many-
decade shutdown. The type of shutdown
generally means continuing instrumenta-
tion following a scram and also a large
delay before the reactor can go back
on line.
Over-power scram. At present, re-
actors employ for protection what is com-
monly known as over-power scram. If
the power out of the reactor exceeds
normal rating by a given amount, the
reactor will be caused to scram. The
over-power trip point for power reactors
can vary from 110% to 200% of full
power. This use of a scram is proper as
long as reactors are isolated, uncommon
devices.
However, there are both immediate
and longer-range problems in the in-
discriminate use of the scram. It is
granted that in the next decade, power
reactors will be only a very small part
of many utility networks. The loss of
any one electrical generator probably will
not affect the network as it undoubtedly
will supply only a small part of the load.
Hence the over-power scram and any
other supersafe device can be indulged in
to the limit of economic feasibility.
As more and more electrical power is
generated from nuclear energy, power
systems will not continue to find com-
plete scrams tolerable. It appears that
a nuclear power plant will be cheaper
on a dollar-per-kw basis the larger the
plant. Nuclear plants of 1,000-Mw elec-
trical output are not beyond present-day
conception. If one of these plants were
removed from the line by a scram, a
larger ripple might occur on the system
with resulting damage and protest.
Reason for over-power scram. Why
should a present-day power reactor have
an over-power scram? The answer
quickly boils down to separate consid-
erations of energy-handling capacity on
both steady-state and transient bases.
First, for the steady-state condition, let
us assume that we have a reactor that
has an output capability very close to its
rating. That is, the reactor may be
capable of putting out continuously only
1.1 times its rating.
It appears that in normal steady-state
operation, if the power level drifts or
otherwise changes slowly in this reactor
from 100% to close to 110% of its
rating, a violent scram is not justified.
Some milder action would be sufficient.
Most suggested acidents can be ana-
lyzed in terms of a change of reactor
power level. Transients originating at
the load end of the plant usually fall
into the slow-drift category in that many
seconds are available to do something
about them. This effect, coupled with the
fact that a properly built-in negative
coefficient also mollifies the accident,
effectively eliminates the need of a scram
to protect against power-level changes
originating in the load.
Plant Control Philosophy
It is a well-established principle of
control systems that the primary control
point should be as close to the output
or working part of the system as possible.
In the case of a nuclear power plant,
this means that the primary control
should start at the load end of the
system rather than at the reactor. The
bottom portion of Fig. 2 illustrates this
situation. We can consider the control
paths that are involved starting from the
output and working back to the reactor.
In a reactor having a negative tempera-
ture coefficient, it has been demonstrated
that the load reflects back directly into
the reactor so that any change in load
creates a corresponding change in reactor
output. In Fig. 2, in the absence of an
external control path, more load calls for
lower temperature into the reactor and
hence more reactivity via the negative
temperature coefficient. The control path
is essentially through the system itself.
The reactor can be operated indepen-
dently from a reactor control point to
handle such problems as startup, xenon,
or depletion, but esentially the steady-
state minute-by-minute load demands are
taken care of by the control path through
the system.
Demand loop. As there are usually
variables other than power output in-
volved, additional control paths may be
required. Figure 2 indicates the addition
of a demand loop to the basic plant.
Here two control paths permit regulation
of another variable such as temperature
or pressure as well as maintaining the
desired power output. The time con-
stants of these two paths generally are
made widely different for stable control
operation with the control path through
the system usually faster and the demand
loop slower.
Parallel control. Some types of plants
have large amounts of piping or long
time delays in the basic control path
through the system. This may require
parallel rather than the series control
just illustrated. Figure 3 indicates such
a situation for a reactor plant with two
heat exchangers. In the control indicated
the change at the primary control point
is also made immediately at several inter-
mediate control points. Local minor
loops around each major component are
sometimes required to settle out the
system around programmed variables.

STRAIGHT TALK TO ENGINEERS
from Donald W. Douglas, Jr.
President, Douglas Aircraft Company
In your field, as most of you well know, it's easy
to be complicated... it's hard to be simple. At
Douglas, I'm happy to say, we do things the
"hard" way. This matter of simplicity is vitally
important. We work intensive hours, days and
months to achieve it.
Why this extra effort? Well, simple things work
easier, last longer, are more easily maintained
and are lots more reliable. We are rewarded for
our greater engineering effort with a product
that performs better for our various customers.
We know that good engineers, working in an
atmosphere which stimulates them to do their
best, have been largely responsible for our suc-
cess. If you enjoy solving challenging problems in
the simplest manner, we'd like to talk with you
about joining us.

(Continued from page 21)
like to explain our approach to the prob-
lem at Chrysler.
Our first attempt was to clearly estab-
lish the need for executive development.
This meant that we had to get a large
amount of physical information regard-
ing our current executive group. We had
to find out their age, their health and
any other factor that might have a bear-
ing on the replacement of these indi-
viduals.
With this basic information we were
able to set up a kind of time table which
would give us the information necessary
so that we could develop men with
definite positions and purposes in mind.
Management or Executive Development
must be purposeful. If we develop a
man to take on additional responsibilities,
we must see that he gets those responsi-
bilities. If we did not give him re-
sponsibilities after a long development
period, the obvious negative reactions
on the individual's part would destroy
all of our efforts and all of his desire.
A second step of great importance
was to appraise the performance and
potential of all of our management men.
This perhaps is the most difficult step
in the development process. Determin-
ing from past performance whether a
man has the ability to take on additional
responsibility requires a deep insight into
all phases of human emotions.
Having determined what we had and
what we needed for the future we then
set about the problem of developing our
younger men for general management in
executive positions.
This can be done in any one of several
different ways. An older and more ex-
perienced individual can coach the
younger executive. In-plant training pro-
grams can be started to assist in execu-
tive development. Almost every one of
our oustanding educational institutions
offers executive development programs.
One of the most interesting of these
is carried on at the University of Pennsyl-
vania where the American Telephone and
Telegraph Company and the University
of Pennsylvania have worked out a two
year course in humanities for their most
promising executives.
The A.T.&amp;T. personnel are taken off
their jobs for two years and sent back
to school and not once during this two
year period do they study any technical
subject.
The limits set upon industry with re-
gard to executive development are great.
Regardless of what industry does, they
cannot make an individual successful in
a general management position. The very
best industry can do is to see that the
person has ample opportunity to prove
himself. Fundamentally the responsibility
for being a success and gaining a general
management position in industry—basi-
cally this is your responsibility.
Executive Traits
There is no one list of human char-
acteristics which, if contained in one per-
son, would make him absolutely success-
ful. What makes one man successful
does not necessarily make another man
successful, but in my mind there are
certain obvious things that are necessary
and requisite to success in the general
management area.
I.
An executive must be better than
average in his mental ability. He need
not be an intellectual giant. As a matter
of fact it will be much better if he
isn't overly intelligent. The man of su-
per-intelligence is more often misunder-
stood than understood and the resultant
problems cause only confusion.
II.
If an individual desires to be an exec-
utive he must understand the very nearly
fantastic demands of such a position.
The desire to be an executive and the
willingness to be an executive are abso-
lutely essential if you are to be a success
in this area.
The question to those of who can go
on to executive positions will become
very clear. The question is resolved to a
point of how much of your life do you
want to give to your corporation to the
exclusion of the many other interests
that exist?
III.
In my mind the third and most im-
portant obvious requisite for a successful
engineer is that he have faith in his own
ability and faith in the ability of his
company.
The decisions and responsibilties of an
executive and his company are often so
far-reaching that they affect not only the
employees, the stockholders, and the
general economy; these decisions often
have direct bearing on our entire society.
The executive must think and have
faith that his actions and the resultant
actions of his company will be the cor-
rect thing not only for business purposes
but for social purposes.
The executive is an integral part of
society and by way of illustrating this
point the story of the "3 Alls" might
be interesting.
In England there is an inn or tavern
known as the Inn of the Three Alls.
Over the door to this inn is a sign.
At the top of the sign is the name of
the tavern "The Inn of The Three Alls"
and under the name are three figures.
The first figure is that of a Clergyman
and under this figure is the inscription
"I pray for all." The second figure is
that of a Soldier and under the soldier
is the inscription "I fight for all." The
third figure is that of a Blacksmith and
the inscription under the blacksmith is
"I work for all."
It is one of my deepest personal con-
victions that success as an executive de-
pends very largely on the executive
adopting the principle and philosophy
that he is working for his entire society.
In closing I would like to restate a
most important fact. It is you who will
be responsible for your success or failure
as an executive and if you accept this
responsibility, let me quote from the in-
fallible source, the Bible and St. Paul,
who said "Neglect not the gift that is
in thee."

IN
ENGINEERING
In this modern age of "fast living", engineers
should stop and consider the role religion plays
in the engineering world.
by C. J. FREUND
We are living in a great engineering
age. There have been ages of great
explorations and discoveries, ages of
great conquest, ages of great empires,
ages of great learning, and ages of great
artistic achievement. This is an age of
great engineering.
The outstanding characteristic of our
time is amazing advance in engineering
and applied science. Technology enters
into just about everything the citizens
has and does: the food he eats, the
heating and cooling of his home, the
automobile in which he goes about, the
light by which he works, the water he
drinks and even the apparatus in the
hospital to which he goes when he is
sick. Five percent of power required
by industries was supplied by machine
in the United States in 1850, and 79%
was supplied by animals. In 1952, 85%
of the power was supplied by machines
and only 11% by animals.
Religious Renewal
But engineering advance is not the
only thing that is going on in the world
just now. There are other important
movements which may not be quite so
obvious. For instance, there has been a
renewal of religion in the United States.
Anybody who carefully looks about
him can see evidence of this renewal.
For instance, the percentage of Ameri-
cans who belong to churches has multi-
plied more than three times in the past
hundred years. This was reported by
President Eisenhower to the World
Council of Churches in their assembly
at Evanston a few years ago.
In his "Protestant, Catholic, Jew," Will
Herberg, a physicist, incidentally) de-
clares that American church membership
has grown 59.8% between 1926 and
1950, while the population has grown
only 28.6%.
At a downtown luncheon not long
ago I found myself sitting next to the
smart, youngish president of a big steel
distributing corporation. He told me that
he had specialized in marketing and
economics in the university. But before
going to the university he had completed
a course in theology. I asked him why.
He replied, "I was convinced that an
understanding of religion would prepare
me better for life and career than any-
thing else."
Until ten or fifteen years ago, people
who pretended to be enlightened fre-
quently made fun of religion. They
called religion "outmoded superstition."
They took their cue from Robert Inger-
soll, Clarence Darrow and others of an
older generation. The scoffers have ap-
parently disappeared. It is no longer fash-
ionable to belittle religion; the public
would not stand for it.
This suggests the question: why is in-
terest in religion reviving? There is
doubtless a combination of causes. One
of them may be fear. People are afraid
of Russia, afraid of communism, afraid
of nuclear bombs, afraid of modern war-
fare. When people fear they begin to
worship. In the First World War a
platoon of American soldiers included
one who regularly went to church and
some fifty-five or so who poked fun at
him. The platoon was quartered in an
old warehouse in France, well back from
the front lines. None of the soldiers had
ever been in action or in the trenches.
One morning an immense German shell
landed in the yard just outside the ware-
house. All the windows were shattered
and part of one wall was blown in. Not
one of the men was injured but in an
instant all of them were on their knees
praying desperately.

ligion-grounded life are these students
and parents, here seen greeting Rever-
end Alfred Scheips at the University
Lutheran Chapel.

Engineering Religion
Now, why is interest in religion of
concern to engineers? After all, the
Michigan Technic is the journal of a
college of engineering; it is not the
publication of a seminary or school of
theology.
For one thing, religion is becoming
increasingly important in American life,
and engineers must be informed about it.
Engineers must understand the civiliza-
tion in which they live in order to func-
tion properly. Vannevar Bush says that
engineers "minister to the people." But
engineers can't minister to the people
effectively unless they understand the
people; unless they know what people
think about and what they hope for.
Engineers can't minister to the people
if they concentrate exclusively on ma-
chines and structures, and know nothing
about people's aspirations. One of the
people's aspirations is religion.
There are other reasons why engineers
must take religion seriously. In the past
six or seven years the American engi-
neering profession has been paying
sharply increased attention to professional
ethics. In 1952, at Dartmouth College,
the American Society for Engineering
Education appointed a special committee
on ethics. Engineers' Council for Profes-
sional Development featured concentrated
discussion of ethics in their annual meet-
ings at Toronto in 1955, and at Detroit
in 1956. Within the year the National
Society of Professional Engineers has
published a booklet which explains and
amplifies the Canons of Ethics of Engi-
neers' Council for Professional Develop-
ment. There is hardly an important na-
tional engineering society which does not
have a committee on ethics or one on
professional practice.
Engineers have a dual responsibility.
They must not only devise and construct
structures and machines to serve the
needs of people; they must also be
trustworthy and responsible, and they
must be honest with employers or clients,
fellow engineers, subordinates, with peo-
ple who supply them with materials and
equipment, and with the citizens in the
community. In other words, they must
be ethical.
Ethics, of course, is not religion.
Ethics is built upon philosophy and ex-
perience, but religion and ethics go hand
in hand. The engineer has to have a
reason for being ethical. He won't be
ethical just because he has read through
the Canons of Engineers' Council for
Professional Development. He has to
have a reason for doing what is right
and avoiding what is wrong. There are
no such reasons inherent in the kind of
work that he does. There is nothing in
science or applied science to make the
engineer ethical. In "Religious Perspec-
tives in College Training," Dr. Hugh
Taylor of Princeton University has de-
clared that
. . . the data of astronomy, biology,
chemistry, geology, mathematics or
physics have little to tell us con-
cerning the regulation of human
conduct. These sciences provide an-
swers as to observed behavior; but
they do not answer the question
whether such behavior is right or
wrong. The whole area of ethical
judgments or conclusions lies out-
side the province of these sciences.
They cannot answer the question:
should I do this, ought I do that?
Through the ages, religion has been
recognized as the strongest motive for
ethical conduct. The Committee on
NOVEMBER, 1958
31


neering Education puts it this way:
Religion may well be the strong-
est motive for right conduct. All
religions of the Judaeo-Christian
system prescribe the Ten Command-
ments. There are people, of course,
who deport themselves correctly
without subscribing to any form of
religion. But if the experience of
centuries means anything, the great
majority of religious persons can be
depended upon to be ethical. To
worship the Creator, and to have a
high regard for one's fellow man as
the likeness of the Creator, seem to
have inspired most of the person-
ages whom history recognizes as es-
pecially high minded and ethical.
Men who have all their lives been
members of religious denominations
invariably and justly are expected to
be upright in their dealings with
fellow citizens. In fact, this is so
much the case that it is considered
especially disgraceful when a church
member fails to live up to accepted
ethical standards.
People assume that the religious per-
son will be ethical.
The Engineer's Purpose
An intelligent and thoughtful engi-
neer must have an over-all purpose for
the work he does; something beyond the
objectives of each day. From morning to
evening he is driven to finsh his as-
signed tasks, merely to get them out of
the way. But to get behind him a
succession of days is not a particularly
ennobling objective. The thoughtful
engineer needs a better purpose than that.
One such purpose, of course, is to earn
a living. Another is to contribute to the
well-being of his fellow citizens. A
third purpose may be even more im-
portant to the kind of man who thinks
through his destiny and the reasons why
he lives. Such a man recognizes an
obligation to worship the Creator. But
formal religious exercise is not the only
way to serve the Creator. The engineer
who understands his status in total sees
in his professional projects a way to
serve the Almighty. Hugh Taylor ex-
presses this idea very well in "Religious
Perspectives in College Teaching" from
which we have just quoted:
Something will have escaped us
if we fail to recognize beyond the
material considerations, something
in the word that goes back to its
Latin roots: sacrum facere: in mak-
ing sacred our daily effort and toil
in the laboratory, the lecture hall,
the factory, or workshop, we can
achieve the unity of life and the
faith in the future that are essen-
tial for well-being.
A Sense of Proportion
Religion gives to engineers a sense
of proportion. The engineer has the
forces of nature in his hands. He has
a sense of power and control. But there
is danger that he may acquire an exag-
gerated sense of his power. He has to
know where he fits in the total scheme
of things. He must know what he can
do and what he cannot do. He must
realize that his power over the forces of
nature gives him no direct control what-
ever over the souls of men nor over
what they will do in the field of politics,
economics and government. He must not
make a fool of himself. Religion will
make him humble.
Engineers and scientists have not
always realized their limitations. A gen-
eration ago it was expected that super-
men in science and engineering would
take over the world's affairs and create
a terrestrial paradise. But the supermen
blundered. At first they were confident
and arrogant. Then they ran into a
horrible World War. Millions of men
and women died violent deaths. The
supermen ran from the stage and nobody
has heard from them since. They could
build, and goodness knows they could
destroy, but they could not make men
happy.
Religion will prevent engineers from
again attempting the role of supermen.
There is nothing which will give a man
as much wisdom, poise, and sense of
proportion as the worship of the Creator.
An engineer who recognizes the over-
lordship of the Almighty is not likely
to begin work on a project which is
destined of its nature for confusion and
catastrophe.
Americans have been successful organ-
izers. They know how to coordinate and
how to cooperate. Two smart Americans
who have never met before can be work-
ing together successfully and efficiently
within fifteen minutes after they have
got together and assumed responsibility
for a task. Perhaps engineers and clergy-
men should get together and work to-
gether. We are in the midst of an amaz-
ing acceleration of engineering progress.
We are in the midst, likewise, of an
unexpected and widespread restoration
of interest and activity in religion.
The engineer has frequently been ac-
cused, doubtless with some justice, of
being materialistic. Clergymen have prob-
ably inclined toward classical and human-
istic interests, and have not sufficiently
appreciated the significance of applied
science. Engineers and clergymen, closely
coordinated, should be able to work
wonders for us. By joint effort they may
enable us to qualify for our new re-
sponsibility as the world's leading nation.
We had no ambition to be the leading
nation, but the responsibility has been
thrust upon us and we shall have to
meet that responsibility as best we can.
Engineers and clergymen may together
accomplish an important share of this
responsibility.

Development Center. Experimental shops and offices
covering some 17 acres are in the foreground, while the
tests areas, barely visible in upper left, lie four miles in
the background.
LOCATION—The new Center is located at United,
Florida, midway between West Palm Beach and Lake
Okeechobee, in the upper Everglades area. It is almost
surrounded by a wildlife sanctuary. Most employees live
in the cities and towns along the east coast of Florida,
driving to the Center on excellent new highways.

Another Unmatched Engineering Facility to
Advance Propulsion Systems of the Future
Future aircraft and missiles may require propulsion
systems far different from those in wide use today
— different in size, power output, appearance, and
perhaps even in the basic method of utilizing energy.
To probe the propulsion future . . . and to build
and test greatly advanced propulsion systems for
coming generations of flight vehicles, Pratt &amp;
Whitney Aircraft is now operating its new Florida
Research and Development Center. This facility
supplements Pratt &amp; Whitney's main research and
development installations in Connecticut.
The new Florida Center, financed and built by
Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, is unique in America's
air industry. Here a completely air-conditioned
plant with 17 acres under roof is specially designed
and equipped for the development of new power
plants of virtually any type. Testing is handled in
special isolated areas; the nearest is four miles
from the plant and many miles from any inhabited
area. The new Center can be greatly expanded on
its 10-square-mile site. Continued isolation is in-
sured by a vast wildlife sanctuary in which the
Center is located.
Of the many people employed at the Center to-
day, about half are scientists, engineers and highly
trained technicians. By late next year, the total
number is expected to be almost doubled.
The new Florida Research and Development
Center is one more reason why Pratt &amp; Whitney
Aircraft is able to continue producing the world's
best aircraft propulsion systems ... in whatever
form they take.

FIND THE GOING GOOD
As seniors begin to think seriously about their
future work and undergrads start looking for
summer jobs, a Technic editor surveys the place-
ment situation for the past year. Edited by LARRY SELWITZ, '59E
In evaluating the employment picture
for the Engineering College of the
University of Michigan, the Engineering
Placement Office has published a pam-
phlet of findings for the 1957-58
academic year.
The past year was notable for the
first substantial reversal in the upward
trend of engineering demand which
started in 1950. The national demand
for engineers in 1957-1958 has been
estimated at a reduction of one-third
that of the preceding year.
In spite of this large reduction, how-
ever, demand was still at a high level,
and virtually all Michigan engineering
graduates were able to find satisfactory
employment before graduation. This ap-
plied to both the February and June class-
es, in spite of earlier predictions that the
June class would have fewer opportu-
nities. These predictions were based on
the fact that most large employers cus-
tomarily determine their hiring quotas
for the year during the summer and
early fall so that the mid-year graduates

Larry Selwitz, Technic associate
editor, received his B.A. degree in
English from a "small New Eng-
land college," whose name he
guards like a guided missile se-
cret, and is current a senior in ME.
The past summer, Larry worked
with Westinghouse in technical
writing. He is a member of the
Society of Technical Writers and
Editors and past president of Sigma
Rho Tau.
have the total quotas open to them,
whereas many of these openings are
filled by the time the larger June classes
graduate, resulting in fewer jobs for
more people.
Also, the reduction in campus recruit-
ing activity was relatively much less, even
with the reduction in demand. The
principal reasons for this appear to be:
1. The level of demand was still high
relative to the number of graduates, so
there was still strong hiring competition,
especially for the higher quality grad-
uates.
2. It is generally recognized that top-
calibre graduates usually get good jobs
on graduation and are well taken care of
thereafter so that they seldom become
available again and therefore can only
be obtained, in general, through the
campus recruiting.
3. It is also generally accepted that
the long-run need for engineers will
continue to exceed the probable supply
so that much recruiting effort has been
continued, not only as a hedge against
an immediate upturn, but to maintain a
good position for future recruiting.
Effect on Starting Salaries
Practically no change occurred in start-
ing salaries offered during the Fall of
1957 in comparison with those of the
1957 Spring season. Between semesters,
however, a significant increase occurred,

Mathematically Perfect Pipe Support!
The exclusive geometric design of the
Grinned Constant Support Hanger balances
the moment of the vertically shifting load
with a mathematically equal spring
moment at every point throughout the full
range of travel.
GRINNELL CONSTANT SUPPORT HANGERS
may be adjusted over a 70% range of load
carrying capacity, as indicated by the divi-
sions on the load scale. When factory-ad-
justed to a specified load within this range,
there always remains not less than \0c/o for
additional field adjustment.
Compact design, resulting in small size
for the load supported, makes Grinnell Con-
stant Support Hangers easy to install—allows
their use where only limited head room and
space for close nesting are available. Sim-
plicity of design makes these hangers easy
to maintain.
Grinnell designs, manufactures and sup-
plies pipe hangers and supports for every
piping requirement.
In addition, Grinnell offers the services of
trained field representatives and design serv-
ices for consulting engineering firms. Contact

uranium we are dealing with is big
enough, every time new neutrons are
released, at least one will hit nuclei and
cause more to be released. In one mil-
lionth of a second after the "chunk"
is of critical mass, i.e., big enough, the
entire mass of the material is transmuted
into various fission products, along with
a tremendous amount of energy. An
atom bomb slams together two pieces
of 92U23'a which together exceed the crti-
cal mass, hence it explodes immediately.
However, a nuclear reactor has moder-
ators of some material, for example car-
bon, which absorb some of the product
neutrons and keep the reaction from
explosive proportions.
The other type of special energy re-
leasing reaction that will be considered
in this article is the process of fusion.
At very high temperatures, light atoms
will fuse together to form heavier ele-
ments and release energy. Hydrogen
isotopes are used in the device which
is called a "hydrogen bomb." Below are
listed a few possible reactions for a
hydrogen bomb and the energies they
give off:
,H2 + ,H2 -&gt;
,H3 + ,H&gt; -f 4 Mev
,H2 + ,H2 -&gt;
jHe3 + 0n' + 4 Mev
,H3 + ,H3 -&gt;
2He&lt; + 2„n' -f 11 Mev
,HS + ,H! -&gt;
2He4 + on1 -f 18 Mev
Thus far the transmutations have been
of more value for the energy that they
release than the products of the trans-
mutations. Fission and fusion provide
spectacular sources of energy, more valu-
able already than all the gold in the
world.
Synthetic Elements
In considering transmutations thus far,
we have been limited to the case where
one known element changes into another
known element. But about twenty years
ago a transmutation produced a new
element, not found in nature.
The first synthetic element to be cre-
ated was technetium, element with atomic
number 43. It was first produced in
1937 from a sample of molybdenum that
was irradiated with deuterons in the Uni-
versity of California cyclotron. It was
then sent to C. Perrier and E. Segre of
Italy who identified a chemical fraction
that was the new element. One isotope
of technetium has a half life of more
than 100,000 years, consequently it is
stable enough to produce some for chemi-
cal tests. However, its short half life
makes it unlikely that any exists in na-
ture; any which did exist when the earth
was formed would have long since de-
cayed. Technetium has been found to
be one of the many fission products of
92U235, hence it can be had in reasonable
quantities. For every gram of 92U23r'
which breaks up in an atomic pile, 26
miligrams of 43Tc" are formed.
Another synthetic element is the rare
earth promethium, element 61. The
chemical family know as rare earths,
elements with atomic numbers of 58-71,
exhibit similar chemical properties. The
chemical separation of rare earths is an
arduous task, to find a new element in
rare earth ores an almost impossible one.
However, it was possible to prepare the
element promethium from two develop-
ments of the Manhattan project. One
development was the separation of rare
earths by means of ion-exchange resins.
(Rare earths passed through a column
containing resin come off the column in
an order inversely dependent on atomic
number.) It was assumed that if ele-
ment 61 existed it would follow element
62 samarium, which it did. Second and
more direct, promethium of atomic
weight 147 was found in the fission
products from uranium. It has been iso-
lated in the pure state and has a half
life of 2.6 years.
A third element prepared in small
quantities is element 85, astatine. It is a
member of the halogens and was pre-
pared from bismuth by bombarding it
with accelerated ions of helium. There
seems to be no easy way of preparing
it in visible amounts—no known iso-
tope of it has a half life of more than
a few hours. At221 is intensely radio-
active, giving off alpha particles of two
distinct energies.
The fourth element, below uranium,
which was transmuted from another ele-
ment was francium, element 87. In 1936
Mile. M. Perey of France separated a
substance which she proved to be an
alpha decay product of element 89,
actinium. It was a 21 minute beta par-
ticle emitter: indicating that it had a
short half life. Subsequent investigation
has shown that Ac225 decays sometimes
by alpha emission with a half life of
only five minutes. While the short half
lives and difficulty of separating francium
isotopes have made chemical investiga-
tion of the element very hard, francium
is known to behave like an alkali in
solution and has great volatility when a
solution of it is dryed and heated, a
property of alkali elements prominent in
cesium.
Transuranium Elements
So much for filling in the gaps in
the periodic table below uranium. The
next major discoveries were above ura-
nium in atomic number. By bombard-
ing heavy nuclei with neutrons, Enrico
Fermi of Italy and others tried to pro-
duce transuranic elements. Uranium-238
was thought to become U-239 when bom-
barded with neutrons — then would

change to element 93 by beta decay.
Instead of beta decay alone being ob-
served, a bewildering array of particles
were observed. At first, it was believed
that a whole group of transuranic ele-
ments had been created—later the truth
was known, fission was discovered as a
by-product of transmutation research.
Neptunium, element 93 with an iso-
tope with a half life of 2.3 days was
eventually found in fission products. As
well, Np-237 with a half life of two
million years as discovered by A. C.
Wahl and G. T. Seaborg at the Uni-
versity of California. Element 93 pro-
vided new evidence for an old suspicion
of the chemists: actinium began a new
series very much like the rare earths and
including thorium, protactinium and
uranium.
By far the most common of the syn-
thetic elements is plutonium which has
been made in quantities which could be
measured in tons. Plutonium is valuable
because it decays into 92U235 with the
release of alpha particles. As was men-
tioned earlier, fl2U235 is the "explosive"
capable of sustaining of chain reaction
from which atom bombs are made. Plu-
tonium and then U-235 are made from
U-238 by bombarding it with slow neu-
trons forming neptunium and beta par-
ticles. The neptunium decaps into plu-
tonium and beta particles:
„U»» + ^ ^ 92U"» -&gt;
MMpM9 + _iC0
B3Np"9 -&gt; 94Pu239 + _,e°
Only the technical and economic mobil-
ization of wartime made it possible to
produce large quantities of plutonium;
the first and perhaps only synthetic ele-
ment in large quantities.
The discovery that the elements after
actinium formed a new chemical family,
similar as the rare earths are similar,
was a clue in the discovery of elements
95 and 96 (americium and curium).
Using the ion-exchange method as was
mentioned previously concerning the rare
earths, the heaviest transuranic element
comes out of the exchange column first;
lighter ones follow in succession.
Elements 97 and 98 (berkelium and
californium) were transmuted from ele-
ments 95 and 96. Element 95 was sepa-
rated from plutonium from nuclear re-
actors in miligram amounts. Bombard-
ment of 95 with alpha particles pro-
duced element 97; bombardment with
neutrons produced reasonable quantities
of element 96. The element 96 was
then bombarded with alpha particles to
form element 98, californium. Recently
it was announced at the United Nations
conference on peaceful uses of the atom
at Geneva by University of California
scientists that a "chunk" of californium
weighing about one milligram had been
produced in a nuclear reactor. Because
it undergoes spontaneous fission, cali-
fornium may be valuable enough to be
produced in gram or kilogram quantities
like plutonium.
Elements 99, 100, 101 have been pro-
duced and identified since 1952. Ele-
ments 99 and 100 were identified from
material collected on filter paper by drone
airplanes flying through the explosion
clouds connected with the 1952 atomic
tests in the Pacific. Other raw material
containing the new- elements was col-
lected from fallout on a neighboring
atoll. Element 99 was named einsteinium
and element 100 fermium.
Finally, element 101 was detected be-
NOVEMBER, 1958


of californium, spontaneous fission. At
present, the largest amount of it which
have been produced and identified is no
larger than 100 atoms. Element 101 has
been named mendelevium in honor of
the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleyev
who first predicted the chemical prop-
erties of elements using the periodic
table of elements. Without the predic-
tive power of his method, none of the
last seven elements could have been cre-
ated and recognized.
Transmutations For Tracers
An important practical use of trans-
mutation is to produce rare radioactive
isotopes of common elements. Such
radioactive materials are used as tracers
to follow a complicated industrial, chemi-
cal, or biological process. For example,
if one were to test the filter on a gas
mask to determine the degree to which
it absorbed harmful substances, radio-
active tracers could be used. Some of
the poisonous material could be made
from a radioactive element (perhaps
transmuted from some other common
one) and the mixture sent through the
filter. Then the amount of radioactivity
on the inside would be proportional to
the amount of poisonous materials which
passed through and the individual points
on the filter could be checked to deter-
mine where the material was absorbed.
Another similar situation occurs in biol-
ogy when it is desired to follow the flow
of carbon dioxide in a plant. Part of
the carbon dioxide can be made from
radioactive carbon and a geiger counter
used to tell whether the plant uses it in
the leaves, stem, etc. as well as the
amount present by the intensity of radia-
tion. Using radioactive tracers, scientists
recently unraveled some of the mystery
concerning photosynthesis, the process by
which sugars are manufactured by green
plants.
Hence, the idea of transmutation was
an old one, but the method of the mod-
ern transmutations are the subjects of
most of applied nuclear physics. While
a pure isotope of mercury can be manu-
factured from gold at a profit for special
purposes, the best method of making
gold from cheaper elements would be
1000 times more expensive than the
natural element. But many new elements
have been created in nuclear transmuta-
tions and fission was discovered as a by-
product of a transmutation reaction.
Hence the development of atomic power
started with a transmutation and depends
on transmutation reactions for its oper-
ation. The creation of valuable radio-
active isotopes for use as tracers has
invigorated present research in almost
all fields of science and industry. So
the real original goal of the alchemists
has been attained: valuable elements are
created from less valuable ones and the
by-product of nuclear energy has been
found also.

Piloted weapons are continuously adding to man's
knowledge and control of the earth's envelope. At the
same time, they are the vanguard in a giant, new step:
getting man's decision-making power out into space.
These interwoven efforts at Chance Vought form an
unmatched career area for young engineers of all
academic specialties.
For example, Vought engineers recently used
automation to make a single pilot a virtual "multiple
man." In Vought's Crusader HI all-weather fighter, he
is freed from cockpit routine by automated controls,
given unprecedented firepower by others.
In this Mach-2-plus fighter, the pilot has begun his
transition to spaceman. Devices for escape from orbit

HUMAN ENDURANCE
by BOB RUSNAK, '60E
Aeronautical design and power-plant
advancements have given birth to
aircraft with performance records un-
dreamed of a decade ago. In the World
War II era pilot performance was on a
par with that of his aircraft, but is
today's pilot able to match his plane's
increased capabilities? The answer to this
question lies in knowing the limits of
human endurance imposed by modern
flight. This month the Technic presents
an article dealing with extensive uni-
versity research aimed at discovering
these limits through the study of muscle
force and fatigue.
In 1952 the Engineering Research In-
stitute, now The University of Michigan
Research Institute, undertook the admin-
istration of a research project concerned
with arm strength at selected degrees
of elbow flexion for the Wright Air De-
velopment Center. Paul A. Hunsicker,
Professor of Physical Education and
Chairman of the Department of Physical
Education for Men, has been the super-
visor of this project since its inception.
An earlier WADC project had re-
sulted in the construction of a dyna-
mometer for testing human strength.
This apparatus, called the Kinematic
Muscle-Study Machine, permitted deter-
mination of the amount of force a man
can exert on a hand-grip dynamometer
with the trunk and arms in a fixed posi-
tion. The machine, which is adjustable
to a variety of bodily types, can be ad-
justed so that the forces exerted by a
man's arms, whether he is lying down,
sitting straight up, or is in any inter-
mediary position, can be measured. The
University of Michigan group undertook
to determine how much arm force can be
exerted with the body and arms in se-
lected positions.
Extent of Investigation
The investigation was concerned with
the amount of force a subject could exert
with his arms when the elbows were at
angles of 180°, 150°, 120°, 90°, and
60°. The program was divided into two
parts: tests of force exerted in the sit-
ting position and in the prone position.
Subjects were never given both tests on
the same day; in fact, as much as a week
or ten days separated the second test from
the first. Each arm was tested in a
series of six movements at each elbow
position: a pull, a push, a lift up, a push
down, abduction (i.e., pushing away
from the midline of the body) and ad-
duction (i.e., pulling toward the mid-
line). These movements last five seconds
each; a one-minute rest was permitted
between movements. The examiner took
three single-frame exposures of each
movement, usually at the two-second,
three second, and four-second points.
Since the examiner was able to watch the
indicators during the test, it was also
possible to record the maximum effort in
all instances.
Altogether, 120 strength tests were
given to each of 55 subjects, all students
at the University between 17 and 25
years old. Most of these students were
similar in bodily type to Air Force crew
members. A few extreme types were in-
cluded in an attempt to establish an over-
all range in strength for this age group.
Results and Recommendations
The variance in strength, even in this
relatively small sample, was surprisingly
large. A comparison of the extreme
scores revealed that one man exerted ten
times as much strength as another. In
the sitting position the greatest force
could be applied in the push movement;
the others, in descending order, were the
pull, lift up, push down, adduction, and
abduction. The least force exerted in the
sitting position was slightly less than one-
third the amount exerted in the strongest
movement. In the prone position the
maximum strength was exerted in the
pull movement; this was followed by the
push, lift up, adduction, push down, and
abduction. In this case, the best force
was again slightly less than one-third the
maximum strength. The difference in
order between the two body positions
was probably due to the lack of a foot-
rest in the prone position, which would
definitely reduce the pushing force. A
44
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


sitting and the prone positions showed
that, in all cases, the forces exerted from
the sitting position were the greater. It
was also found that the maximum
strength can be applied when the elbows
are at 120° flexion.
As a result of this investigation, it was
recommended that aeronautical engineers
reserve the movements of pushing and
pulling for the operation of those lever-
age systems which call for extreme ef-
forts because the greatest amount of arm
strength can be applied in these actions,
whereas the arms in forward extension
make relatively weaker movements when
lifting, depressing, abducting, or adduct-
ing.
Position Tests
Following this investigation, the Michi-
gan group continued its exploration into
human strength by determining the force
that a man can exert when his hands
and arms are in certain selected positions.
In this investigation tests were adminis-
tered to subjects seated in a simulated
pilot seat with their palms facing either
up or down. Again about a week sepa-
rated the one test from the other. At
elbow positions of 180°, 150°, 130°,
90°, and 60°, six movements with each
arm were made: push forward, pull back-
ward, pull up, push down, abduct, and
adduct. Each test lasted five seconds.
Three single-frame exposures of each
trial were taken. Thirty University stu-
dents, ranging in age from 18 to 27
years, were selected for these tests. It
was found that, on the whole, a subject
in the sitting position can exert a greater
amount of strength with the wrists in a
supinated (palm facing downward)
position than with wrists in the pronated
position, (palm facing upward). The
one exception was the adduction move-
ment, where a greater strength was ex-
hibited with the wrists in a pronated
position. Maximum strength values were
usually obtained when the elbow flexion
was 60°. In general, the right side was
stronger than the left. With the subject
in the sitting position, it was found that
the three strongest movements were lift
up, push forward, and push down (in
this order). The same order was true
for both arms and for the supinated and
pronated positions. The other three ac-
tions (back pull, abduction, and adduc-
tion) were, in general, less than half as
strong. Also, it was once again quite
apparent that there are tremendous differ-
ences in human strength and that some

people are capable of exerting ten times
as much strength as others.
After completing this phase of the
research, it was decided to test the amount
of strength that young men could exert
during wrist pronation and wrist supina-
tion. These movements are called for in
numerous manually operated control
systems. Twenty-five students were se-
lected on the basis of certain anthropo-
metric measurements. The tests were
carried out on a Kellogg Universal Dyna-
mometer, which operates on the principle
of a piston displacing mercury. Each
subject sat erect on a seat, both feet
on the floor, elbows at right angles, and
either the right or the left hand grasp-
ing the handle of the dynamometer. Pro-
nation and supination, each with both
hands, were tested. These tests indicated
that a moderately high amount of
strength was possible in both positions.
The average strength was the same for
pronation and supination, and there was
only a very slight difference between the
strength of the right and left hands.

The effect of loss of sleep on the re-
sults of the strength tests was studied
next. Six subjects, two below the aver-
age in size, two about average, and two
above average, were chosen for this ex-
periment. The subjects got up at 7 a.m.
on Saturday and reported to the labora-
tory at noon. The first tests were made
at approximately 2 p.m. and were re-
peated every hour thereafter until 7 a.m.
on Monday. The subjects were confined
to the laboratory and the adjacent area
except for two meals on Saturday and
Sunday evenings. They had coffee, fruit,
milk, cookies, etc., at their disposal, and
were permitted to sleep a total of four
hours in the laboratory. They were al-
lowed to read, study, listen to the radio,
play cards, or talk throughout the test
period.
For these strength tests the subject
was seated to the left of the Kellogg
Dynamometer, and the dynamometer
handle was adjusted so that it could be
grasped with the right arm fully ex-
tended. For one trial the wrist was pro-
nated, and for the second it was su-
pinated. On a given signal the subject
listed as hard as he could and the maxi-
mum reading was recorded. After com-
pleting the two tests with the right arm,
the subject moved to a chair that was
situated on the right side of the dyna-
mometer and repeated the two tests with
the left arm.
The strength-decrement data collected
during the 42-hour test period indicated
that, in general, there was a decline in
strength during the test period, but that
it was possible for a subject to marshall
sufficient reserve strength for the single
maximum effort called for in this investi-
gation to attain a value that was as good
as his initial test. In fact, the final score
in a number of instances was actually
better than the first, although the general
pattern was a decline during the latter
stages of the test period.
This group has made valuable contri-
butions to aircraft designers by furnish-
ing them with reference material on the
strength of the human arm at selected
degrees of elbow flexion. Although
knowledge concerning human strength
has increased tremendously in the past
few decades, there is still much to be
learned. For instance, additional studies
must be conducted concerning the rela-
tionship between loss in strength and
limited sleep before any generalization
cm be drawn about the effect of sleep
on muscular strength.

THE DEVELOPMENT
OF RADAR
Early radar research has led to the develop-
ment of an important instrument in our nation's
defense.
by KEN DEC, '61E
One of the most useful and important
electronic devices in the world
today is radar. This modern method of
detection is employed daily in the indus-
trial, scientific and military fields. The
last of these fields is by far the most
important, for radar is the backbone of
national defense. It's invisible and pene-
trating eyes are used to give advanced
warning of approaching enemy attack, and
to increase the effectiveness of defense
weapons, such as antiaircraft guns, guided
missiles, and torpedoes. Radar's useful-
ness in warfare was proven conclusively
in the second world war. Many people
mistakenly believe that, because of it's
sudden success as a military weapon,
radar was discovered and developed dur-
ing the war years. In reality, the prin-
ciples and early development in radar
date back well over a half century. Only
through the tireless efforts of many
scientists and engineers has radar been
able to rise to the important position it
holds in the world today.
Signal Corps men are here seen oper-
ating one of the first radar units em-
ployed by our Armed Forces.
Early Ideas
We can trace some important ground-
work for the ultimate idea of radar to
the electrical research, during the 1880's,
of Heinrich Hertz. Born in Germany,
Hertz was a brilliant physicist. Although
he died at thirty-seven, he had com-
pleted many far reaching experiments
in the electrical field. In one of these,
Hertz investigated the properties of elec-
tromagnetic waves and found they could
be reflected, just like light waves striking
a shiny object. This is the heart of the
principle on which radar operation is
based.
Conceivably men like Crooks, Braun,
Hertz and other scientists busy with their
fundamental electrical researches, might
have envisioned the creation of some
such apparatus as radar. The fact that
they did not actually blueprint this de-
vice, even though they pioneered radar's
essentials, is certainly no reflection on
their mental ability or vision. After all,

less was in its infancy, while radio had
not yet been invented.
It remained for scientists and engi-
neers, like Nikola Telsa, to predict the
actual coming of radar years after the
discoveries of Hertz and other early
pioneers. Telsa was born in Yugoslavia
and received a solid backing in mathe-
matics, physics, and electrical engineer-
ing. He came to America in 1884 and,
after working with Thomas Edison for
a short time, formed an electrical re-
search company of his own. In this com-
pany Telsa brought into existence a series
of electrical inventions that gave him a
solid and renowned standing in the field.
But it was his ability to foresee the
possible uses of electrical energy that
caused the lifting of eyebrows. Not the
least of these was Telsa's magazine article
in 1900 predicting the coming of radar.
In this article Telsa wrote, "By their
use (electrical waves) we may produce
at will, from a sending station, an elec-
trical effect in any particular region of
the globe; we may determine the relative
position or course of a moving object,
such as a vessel at sea, the distance
traversed by same, or its speed."
More than twenty years later Telsa's
ideas on a possible radar device were
substantiated by Guglielmo Marconi.
After his invention of the wireless, Mar-
coni devoted himself to a new field of
ultra-short electric waves. In 1922, after
extensive tests, Marconi made this state-
ment before a group of radio and elec-
trical engineers. "It seems to me that
it should be possible to design apparatus
by means of which a ship could radiate
or project a divergent beam of these rays
in any desired direction, which rays, if
coming across a metallic object, such as
another steamer or ship, would reflect
back to a receiver screen from the trans-
mitter on the sending ship, and therefore
immediately reveal the presence and bear-
ing of the other ship in fog or thick
weather.
Marconi urged his listeners to do more
research on shorter electrical waves. Ap-
parently his words were heeded, for soon
the first crude radar sets began to appear.
This beginning took place almost simul-
taneously in the United States, Britain,
France and Germany.

One of the real pioneers in radar work
in the United States was Dr. Albert
Hoyte Taylor, a physicist and electrical

OF
PROBABILITY
From quality control to matching coins, prob-
ability is important.
by JAMES T. MILLER, '58E
How often is it that a person uses
or hears the expression, "What
are the odds?" Matching coins, shoot-
ing crap, or playing poker are games in
which the odds hold keen interest for
the participants. The reasoning that a
person uses to determine the odds is
called the probability calculus.
Probability calculus is used extensively
in the theory of statistical quality control.
The practicing quality control engineer
knows the definition of probability, has
a grasp of probability and relative fre-
quencies of random mass phenomena,
and can draw a random sample to deter-
mine the quality of his raw materials or
finished products.
To the quality control engineer prob-
ability is usually defined as the relative
frequency. A coin has two sides, a head
and a tail. Therefore, the sporting indi-
vidual has a 0.5 probability of flipping
a head. If a certain machine produces
10,000 parts in a week, and of these
10,000 parts there are 100 defective
parts, the probability of a worker's using
a defective part in assembly would be
0.01. It can be stated that, if a set of
objects is classified in a particular way,
so that the classes are mutually exhaustive
and conclusive, the probability of an ob-
ject's being in a certain class is the
relative frequency of that class in the set.
Probability Sets
Probability pertains to a given set of
things, physical or abstract, classified in
in a certain way. It is possible to classify
parts, produced by a machine, according
to color, weight, size, and shape. A
machine could produce parts of two
colors, for example, red and blue. Then
one would speak of the probability of a
red part or the probability of a blue
part. Thus, the engineer is familiar with
the term and process known as prob-
ability set. This term pertains to both
the set of objects being classified, the
machined parts, and the basis of classi-
fication, the color. Probabilities are
always defined with references to a cer-
tain probability set.
The theory of probability is not re-
stricted to small sets. The definition of
probability holds true regardless of the
size of the set. The relative frequency
of a given class in a set determines the
probability. One might consider the out-
put of a machine that runs into the mil-
lions or billions of parts or any other
size of set when determining the prob-
ability of a class.
The real interest in flipping a coin is
not in the fact that the coin has two
sides, but rather, in the question of
whether or not heads would come up
as many times as tails in a number of
flips. With this interest, one considers
the probability and relative frequencies
of random phenomena. These consider-
ations are essentially different, but in a
James T. Miller, a Technic guest author, graduated from the
Engineering College last February in Chemical Engineering. While
at Michigan, Jim included among his activities Alpha Chi Sigma,
chemistry and chemical engineering professional fraternity, and
A.I.Ch.E. A graduate of Menominee (Michigan) High School, Jim
says his primary interests include meeting people, reading books of
a non-technical nature, and all sports—especially golf.
Upon graduation, Jim took a position with Union Carbon and
Carbide in Fremont, Ohio, but has since been transferred to Carbide's
division in Bennington, West Virginia, where he is presently work-
ing with batteries.
50
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


by what may be called a randomizing
operation, the probability parameter be-
comes a reasonably good prediction of
the relative frequency of the given class.
Thus, if our coin is completely uniform,
one may predict on this basis, when the
coin is shaken in one's hand in a ran-
dom manner, the relative frequency of
a head in many shakings will be close
to 0.5.
Randomness
It is to be noted that randomness is
an assumption to the argument. For a
person to tell whether or not a part was
picked at random is pure folly. It is for
the person to prove that the part was
picked in a non-random manner. Sup-
pose that the parts come in a large car-
ton, and the person took the pieces from
the top of the carton. Then it can be
stated that the parts were not picked at
random.
In relating probability to relative fre-
quencies of mass phenomena, two points
must be considered. First, the phe-
nomena must be mass phenomena. It
would be hard to predict that heads
would appear five times when a coin is
flipped ten times. However, if the coin
were flipped 5,000 times, one would be
much safer in predicting heads appearing
ing 2,500 times. The gambling houses of
Monaco rarely, if ever, go broke because
with odds fixed in their favor the law
of large numbers iron out temporary
winning streaks.
The final point to consider is that the
predictions are only approximate, not
exact. How far from being exact the
predictions are the engineer does not
know. But, experience has shown that
one can use the probability theory to
predict the relative frequencies with a
reasonable degree of success.
The control engineer realizes the im-
portance of randomness, and therefore,
must be able to draw a random sample.
The engineer must give every member of
the set an equal chance of being drawn.
If he can assign numbers to the mem-
bers of a set, can thoroughly mix the
set, then any section of the set can be
viewed as a random sample of the whole.
In summary, statistical quality control
uses the method of probability calculus.
The practicing engineer is fully aware of
the definition of probability, the close-
ness of probability and frequencies of
random mass phenomena, and the neces-
sity of drawing a random sample.

so that the average starting salaries were
between 3% and 5% higher than for
1956-1957.
This increase compares to increases of
approximately 10% during each of the
two preceding years, which reflects the
reduction in demand, but to a lesser
degree than was expected at the end of
the Fall recruiting season.
The strong increase in defense require-
ments which started during the spring
will apparently continue through the year
as a result of increased government de-
fense expenditures. This demand will
be predominantly for electronics engi-
neers and scientists, but will include
smaller numbers from all branches.
Commercial requirements have not as
(Continued from page 36)
yet shown significant increase, but the
indications seem to be that business,
in general, has "bottomed-out" and that
possibly an upward trend has been estab-
lished. At any rate, considerable opti-
mism is apparent, except in the auto in-
dustry, which is still very unsettled.
It seems reasonable to predict, there-
fore, that overall demand will probably
be somewhat higher next year, which
should insure adequate opportunities for
engineering graduates.
The total number of University of
Michigan engineering graduates at all
degree levels was 826 last year, com-
pared to 774 the prior year, for an in-
crease of 52, or about 7%. There was no
significant change in the distribution of
graduates by class or degree level.
The total number of offers for regular
employment which were reported to the

in all programs, classes, and degree levels
was 532 compared to 816 last year, for
a reduction of 35%.
All Offers Raised
The average of all offers reported to

so, although the trend continued up-
ward, the rate of increase was consider-
ably reduced this year.
The average salary accepted was lower
at all degree levels than the average
offers reported. This may be due to the
students receiving the highest paying
offers turning down those offers for
other endeavors, such as continuing
school.
In ranking by industries, Electrical
Product manufacturing rose from fourth
to first place this year, with little change
in the rankings of other industries or
in the ranking by programs.

PROGRESS
Compiled by MIKE MALINOWSKI, '61E
Two radical concepts in building de-
sign will be reviewed in this issue.
One concerns a new idea in the Union
Dome building (building without inner
supports) of Baton Rouge, La. The
second is an edifice 340 ft. long by 30
ft. wide. It is a factory of polyester
plastic. New ideas concerning the prob-
lems of high nuclear fuel are also in
the picture. The incessant endeavor to
conquer the unknown of outer space con-
tinues to steal news space. Other minor,
but interesting, scientific and technical
progress briefs include a service station
on wheels, an F-M radio-controlled set
of street lights and an Army mule . . .
of the mechanical variety. These are but
a fraction of the innovations that the
scientific and technical societies have
thrust upon civilization in the past
month.
New Nuclear Fuel Concepts
Two radically new approaches to the
problems of high nuclear fuel, equip-
ment and design costs, which have thus
far prevented the atom from competing
with conventional energy sources, were
proposed today by The Babcock &amp; Wil-
cox Company.
The first concept introduces the use
of mixed "light" and '"heavy" water—
or water of variable density—to control
pressurized and boiling water reactors.
This system would replace the costly and
intricate control rod systems now widely
employed. In addition, the company esti-
mates that this new control method will
"more than double" the useful life of
a water reactor core and increase the
efficiency of fuel consumption up to 30
per cent. Another advantage of the con-
cept is that equipment costs can be re-
duced since it will be possible to extract
up to 75 per cent more heat from a core
of a given size.
To build a reactor core which will
have a long life span, B&amp;W nuclear
specialists explained, it must be loaded
with considerably more fuel than is ac-
tually required to achieve a chain reac-
tion. This extra fuel is then available to
be "burned" to produce heat, power, or
both. When burnup has reduced the
amount of fuel in the core to the mini-
mum required for a chain reaction, the
core can no longer produce heat and
must be replaced.
The fuel placed in the core for burn-
up, they stated, is used up less efficiently
if control rods or other "nuclear poisons"
arc employed to counteract the "reactivity
effects" of the extra fuel. The new
method, they continued, provides a posi-
tive control medium which not only
promises to achieve a low fuel burnup
rate for the amount of heat produced,
but also permits larger amounts of extra
fuel to be added to nuclear cores. This
makes possible a longer-burning and
more efficient reactor fuel cycle.
As a result of the second research
project, the company has developed a
new high temperature reactor coolant con-
sisting of fine particles of solids sus-
pended in gas. The new low pressure
collant, B&amp;W engineers claim, "points
the way to competitive nuclear power
through remarkable reductions in both
size and capital cost of major compo-
nents of nuclear steam generating sys-
tems."
While results of these research projects
have exceeded expectations, B&amp;W re-
ported, additional study will be required
before the findings can be utilized in the
production of power.
Plastics for Construction
A giant air-supported building fabri-
cated from a new polyester film has been
erected in Northfield, Minnesota, by the
G. T. Schjeldahl Company; makers of
stratospheric balloons, air - supported
buildings, and plastic bag-making ma-
chinery.
The building, which is 340 feet long
and 30 feet wide, is being used to house
production lines for the firm's Balloon
and Special Fabrics Division. Thirty
people will work inside the building.
Employees enter and leave the building
through air lock doors.
The new factory—dubbed a "Schjel-
Mile"—is semi-cylindrical with ends of
solid construction. An inside structure,
located at the north end of the building,
houses restrooms and heating and air-

ing to contour.
This is the first time a plastic fabri-
cating firm has made its own factory
from its own product.
G. T. Schjeldahl, 45, president of the
three year old company will market
buildings of this type for use as factory
structures, farm buildings, construction
site covers, swimming pool covers, and
a variety of other uses.
The skin of the building is fabricated
from a new reinforced heat-sealable poly-
ester plastic called "Scotchpak" by its
maker, Minnesoto Mining and Manufac-
turing Company, St. Paul, Minn.
The skin has contained in it a grid
of nylon fibers which tend to form a
rope by combining their individual
strands whenever the plastic is subjected
to a tearing force. This eliminates the
possibility of a "run" in the material.
While no aging tests have yet been
completed on the film, Schjeldahl is
confident the skin will wear well. "When
it needs replacing, we can shed our
cocoon and replace it in less than two
hours," Schjeldahl says, "and at a cost
comparable to that of a paint job for a
conventional structure."
The semi-transparent skin will permit
solar heating of the factory in winter.
The plastic admits as much as two mil-
lion BTUs heat per hour on bright
sunlit days. An ordinary home furnace
has an output of about 90,000 to 120,000
BTUs per hour. Conventional heating
equipment will be used on cloudy days.
A system of sun shades and air condi-
tioners will keep the building cool in
the summer.
Schjeldahl expects that the plastic skin
of the building will pay for itself in heat
savings over a period of the next five
years.
The skin is impervious to moisture,
heat, cold, grease, or solvents. The basic
'"Scotchpak" film from which the build-
ing was fabricated has been used to
package oil, acid, boil-in-a-bag foods,
and both wet and dry chemicals. It has
a workable temperature range of from
minus 70°F to 230°F. It will not dry
out or become brittle with age.
In a press demonstration held inside
the building Schjeldahl graphically
demonstrated some of the building's
properties. He suspended a swing from
the roof of the structure and got onto
it to show that the air supported skin
is very rigid. So rigid, in fact, Schjel-
dahl claims the building can withstand
near hurricane force winds. Yet, the

the contour is about as much as is re-
quired by a person to puff out his cheek.
An air-pressure device on display inside
the building showed one pound per
square inch pressure difference between
outside and inside.
In another test Schejeldahl held a
blowtorch to the side of the building and
melted a hole in it to prove the build-
ing is fireproof and that small holes will
not cause a failure in the structure.
To show this more vividly, an archer
shot arrows from the outside of the
building into a target which was placed
inside the building.
In further tests Schejeldahl cut his way
out of the building with a butcher knife
making a seven-foot-long gash in the
side. The building did not deflate, and
it was quickly repaired with tape. He
also got on top of the building and
walked the length of it.
The G. T. Schejeldahl Company was
organized in Northfield in 1955. The
firm started with a program of strato-
spheric balloon production and research
and the production of heat-sealable tapes
and adhesives.
Today the firm is a dominant manu-
facturer of polyester bag-making ma-
chines. It also is active in classified
balloon production and research for the
government. It has constructed some
1,000 polyester stratospheric balloons,

feet, is 120 feet (10 stories) high, and
is to be used for housing regional main-
tenance and tank car repair facilities.

one of which holds the world's record
of 144,000 feet.
Building Within A Building
The world's largest circular building—
the Union Dome nearing completion at
Baton Rouge, La., by Union Tank Car
Company of Chicago—will enclose a
second dome-shaped geodesic structure
seven stories high.
This unique building-within-a-building
will provide administrative offices, em-
ployees quarters, materials storage and a
Control Tower for operations of the
Union Dome, which houses regional tank
car repair facilities for Union Tank.
The circular inner structure will be
80 feet high, 100 feet in diameter and
provide approximately 7,500 square feet
of floor space. It is of the same geodesic
design as the main Union Dome and is
being constructed of concrete block and
steel. The glass-enclosed Control Tower,
reached by elevator, will serve as the
nerve center for the operations of the
Dome and its facilities.
The huge all-steel Union Dome and
its inner structure are nearing comple-
tion and partial tank car repair opera-
tions are in progress. Full operation is
scheduled in October.
The Union Dome is a clear-span struc-
ture entirely without internal supports
and has a diameter of 384 feet and is
120 feet (10 stories) high. It is the
first major industrial use of a geodesic
dome in this country.
At the ground level of the inner struc-
ture will be an open-space area used for
repair parts and materials storage serv-
icing the various repair stations in the
Dome. At the next level, nine feet above
the storage area, will be an open-deck
mezzanine and an enclosed office for
storehouse supervisory personnel and the
plant's extensive telephone dial system
center.
The main floor of the interior struc-
ture, eighteen feet above the ground, is
supported by fifteen steel pillars. The
7,500 square feet of floor space will in-
clude general administrative offices, re-
ception room, and employees' dining
room, lockers and shower facilities.
Above the main floor is a concrete
observation deck which also will permit
construction of additional offices.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


The Control Tower rises another 50
feet above the observation deck and will
overlook the entire repair area. It will
provide direction of the repair operation
through a two-way communications sys-
tem with tank car repair stations. The
Control Tower elevator is located in the
center column of the structure.
The concrete block areas will be
painted an off-white and the steel struc-
tural members and geodesic framework
rising from the observation deck and
covering the Control Tower, will be
trimmed in royal blue.
Put It Where You Can't See It
A cargo crane that will automatically
select a loading site on board the ship
now is being built. This will solve the
problem of the crane operator who can-
not see the cargo after it has entered the
ship's hold.
Color Converter
A new liquid vinyl color spray that
recolors and refinishes automobile in-
teriors and convertible tops without
changing the original texture of the
fabric is now on the market. The sprayed
finish is available in 12 colors, plus black
and white. A single coat of the finish is
said to be enough for most applications.
It takes about a half-hour to apply the
new coating to the convertible top,
another ten minutes for it to dry.
Between Trains, Autos
Dam-building can make strange bed-
fellows. The Great Northern Railway is
sharing one of its tunnels temporarily
with highway traffic past the Rocky-
Reach Dam construction site on the Col-
umbia River. This will go on until both
railroad and highway are rerouted above
the future reservoir level.
Mechanical Mule
A new vehicle developed for the Army
weighs only 900 pounds, yet can carry
payloads up to 1,000 pounds. The exten-
sive use of light metals includes an
aluminum engine and magnesium plat-
form. Air cooling cuts the weight of the
engine, and balloon tires eliminate all
springing. A driver's seat is provided, but
a jointed steering wheel permits the
operator to walk or even crawl behind
the moving vehicle.

Open here I flung the shutter, when, with ostentatious
flutter,
In there stepped a scraggly rooster—bird I'd never seen
before.
Not the least bit shy he seemed, as atop my lamp he
preened.
Terror struck, I ran berserk and bolted for my chamber
door,
But I tripped upon the rug and dug my nose into the

Crowed the rooster, "Nevermore."
Such a phrase from lowly chicken caused my rapid pulse
to quicken,
Though its statement little meaning, little relevancy bore;
And, apparently demented, I sat there watching this

Refugee from Pathe News, as feathers floated to the

Why should I be thusly cursed by fowl or field before me
Croaking this insipid, "Nevermore?"
Then I had an insipration—this must be a strange creation
Sent to guide me o'er the sea of knowledge to diploma's

Sent from Tutankhamen olden a harbinger of future
golden,
Armed with knowledge, boundless wisdom taken from

Croaked the rooster, "Nevermore."
"Will I be a Wheeler dealer, will I be a dorm free

Tell me bird, this flagrant knowledge I beseechingly
implore
Will the campus queen caress me, and my M. E. readers
bless me,
While my lab reports come back "A's" galore?
Give me light, on mangy beacon, tell of joys for me in
store.
Quoth the rooster, "Nevermore!"
As my sweet illusions shattered, I would cheerfully have
splattered
This old bird against the wall, but reason strong within
me bore,
I must ever be a knave, Engineering's fawning slave.
Back I turned to long forgotten tomes of scientific lore,
As the rooster, slightly steaming, watching me—long

THE DEVELOPMENT
OF RADAR
(Continued from page 49)
engineer for the Naval Research Labora-
tories. In the fall of 1922, Dr. Taylor
was impressed with a special type of
radio wave which, if aimed at steel
buildings or ships, would be reflected
back. He and his associates set up an
apparatus of this type across the Potomac
River, and noticed that every time a
ship passed going up or down river, the
transmitted radio waves of certain fre-
quencies were disturbed.
During the years 1925-1930 the re-
flecting ability of radio waves, and the
newly developed technique of transmit-
ting these in pulse form were used to
study the earth's atmosphere layers.
Gregory Breit and Merle A. Tuve used
electrical waves to measure the iono-
sphere, and thereby confirmed the work
of Kennelly and Heaviside, two physi-
cists who first proposed the theoretical
nature of the ionosphere.
In November, 1930, Dr. Taylor noted,
in a report to his superiors in the Navy
Department, the significance of radio
waves bouncing back from objects in mo-
tion. The Navy was impressed, for in Jan-
uary, 1931, a project was established in
the Radio Division of the Bureau of Engi-
neering for the development of a device
which was to investigate the use of radar
to detect the presence of enemy vessels
and aircraft.
In 1932 Dr. Taylor made a report to
his superiors revealing a few of the
obstacles that confronted him and his
associates. One of these difficulties was
the need for a device that could collect,
record, and make use of the data result-
ing from the radio echo. As an answer
to Dr. Taylor's report, two scientists,
working for the Naval Research Insti-
tute developed a computer device of this
type. This computer hastened the time
in which radar could be brought from
the laboratory and into the field.
In the mid-thirties the Navy informed
the Army of Dr. Taylor's experiments.
The Army Signal Corps immediately be-
gan research work, and, on December
14, 1936, produced a radar set which
succeeded in spotting an airplane in
flight. In the same year the Navy placed
some crude, but highly successful radar
instruments on the destroyer U.S.S.
Leary. The Signal Corps, not wanting to
be outdone, showed off a radar unit, in
1937, which was capable of spotting air-
planes twenty-three miles away. This set
was refined and ordered into production
by November 1938. The Navy, inspired
by its success on the U.S.S. Leary,
equipped the U.S.S. New York with
highly developed radar equipment. The
great success of this equipment caused
one naval officer to say, "Radar is one of
the most important radio developments
since the advent of radio itself."
During the early years radar developed
another phase. The need for new
weapons caused a rapid increase in radar
research. One of the foremost institu-
tions devoted to radar research was the
Radiation Laboratories at the Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology. At the
height of activity close to 4,000 engineers
and scientists were intensely engaged in
improving the production and detection
of electro-magnetic waves.
In any discussion of radar develop-
ments one cannot overlook the accom-
plishments of British scientists. Britain
began radar research in the thirties, and
by 1940 had some extremely well de-
veloped radar equipment. One of the
most important contributions by the
British was the megatron. This new
electron tube created electrical impulses
—called micro waves—which were even
shorter than those used in early radar
sets, and greatly improved radar detec-
tion.
The story of radar from the end of
the war till now is one of increased re-
search and development. It is obvious
that radar is not wholly a product of
modern times. Its development into a
practical device represents the climax of
a long story that goes back to the middle
of the nineteenth century, embracing
many countries and the patient, pain-
staking work of numerous scientists and
engineers.

Parts
i
are Free from Inside Faults
—sound from center to surface

"There's an 'inside story' to the
forged parts we use for swivel
joints on steel hose for oil pro-
ducers. These joints work at
pressures up to 15,000 lbs. per
sq. in., temperatures to 600° F.,
and handle abrasives such as
mixtures of oil and sand, and
wet cement. Under such tough
conditions the forged joints prove tight
against leakage, safe against bursting, and
have lasted for many years in such service.
This remarkable durability is possible be-
cause the forged metal is sound, dense,
non-porous from center to surface. Freedom
from inside faults also saves production
dollars; when we cut into the forged parts
to machine precise, expensive ball-bearing
races and accurate mating surfaces, we do
not find inside faults that would cause
rejections. Any way you look at it, this
inside story helps us and our customers."

Diversification is the key to success in
this month's teasers. An expert in a
given field will easily be able to answer
several questions, but it will take a little
knowledge in several fields plus a little
common sense to get them all.
As this is the time of year when the
temperatures drop and you bring out
your winter clothes, you should have
little trouble with this question:
If you turn your right hand glove
inside out and put it on your left hand,
will the palm of the glove be against
the palm of your hand or the back of
your hand?
This next one should be easy for any
student on the campus.
A paper with printing on only one
side has a crease running from the upper
left corner to the lower right corner,
when held with the printed side facing
you. If you held this paper upside down
and backside foremost, would the crease
run:
A.
ner?
B. From upper right to lower left cor-
ner?
Here is one that should be a soft touch
for all E.E. majors.
If you screw an electric bulb in the
socket by turning the bulb to the right
with your right hand, which way would
you turn the socket with your left hand
to unscrew it while holding the bulb
stationary?
A. To the right?
B. To the left?
Not overlooking the aeronautical engi-
neers, I offer this one.
If an autogyro propeller revolves from
left to right when driven by the motor
to lift the machine into the air, will it
revolve in the same or opposite direction
if the motor is shut off when descending
for a landing?
Just one more of these and we will
progress to something a little different.
Describe four ways of turning a glass
of water upside down without spilling

natural laws. There are a least six
methods of doing this.
Now a short and sweet mathematical
question.
What is the largest number that can
be expressed, using three integers?
Since being able to visualize is a prime
characteristic of the engineer, this puzzle
should be your meat and potatoes.
Here are two brick wall panels sup-
posedly laid without mortar. Each wall
is 8 inches thick. Each brick is 2" by 4"
by 8". How many bricks in the upper
wall?

After you have counted and reasoned
out the number in the upper wall, figure
out without counting how many there
are in the lower wall, also 8 inches
thick. Then, remembering that there
are no broken bricks in either wall,
figure out how many extend right
through the one in the lower sketch.
You may count, this time.

1. Palm.
2. B. From upper right to lower left.
3. A. To the right; and it makes no
difference which hand you use.
4. In the same direction.
5. Six ways to choose from:
a. Covering it first with the palm of
your other hand.
b. Placing a sheet of paper over it and
letting atmospheric pressure do the rest.
c. Freezing it, so that a layer of ice
holds it in.
d. Swinging it at arm's length over
your head, so that the water is kept in
by centrifugal force.
e. Inverting it over another glass of
water; done by holding both glasses
under water at once.
/. Lowering the glass into a basin of
water and turning it upside down below
the surface.
6. 99n, not 999 or [(9)9]9.
7. To count the bricks in the upper
wall, knowing the three dimensions of
each, you might have labeled those ex-
tending right through the wall as 1
(thick); those extending a quarter
through as 4 (thick). Then by adding
up the l's, 2's, and 4's, you would have
come to a total of 54, the correct answer.
However, if you'd reasoned out the
easy way, noting that both walls were
3 bricks long by 9 bricks high by 2
bricks thick, yould would reach the same
answer with far less trouble. This is the
way to solve the problem of the lower
wall without counting, by simply noting
that it is the same size as the upper one.
There are 14 bricks extending through
the lower wall—that is, all the bricks
that show the 2" x 4" end view, rather
than the 2" by 8" side view.

MO

Industry's demand for capable graduates in the fields of science and
engineering is still exceeding the supply produced by American colleges
and universities. As a result, the most promising members of this year's
class may well wind up with a number of openings to consider.
In such circumstances, who would blame a bright young man for at
least letting the phrase "eeny, meeny, miny, mo" slip through his mind!
Of course, there is one inescapable conclusion to be considered: open-
ings are one thing, genuine opportunities quite another. Thoughtful
examination of such factors as potential growth, challenge, advance-
ment policy, facilities, degree of self-direction, permanence, and
benefits often indicates that real opportunity does not yet grow
on trees.
Moreover, the great majority of personal success stories are
still being written by those who win positions with the
most successful companies.

With photography as a tool, the N.A.C.A. Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory studies jet
engine combustion chambers, and compounds that can result in new high-energy jet fuels
How much faster and farther our aircraft
and missiles can go seems now to depend on
developing new high-energy fuels. This is a
job of the Lewis Laboratory of the National
Advisory Committee for Aeronautics.
And as in all kinds of industry, photography
is playing an important role in this work.
Motion pictures are taken of the interior of
jet engine chambers through transparent walls.
From the pictures the scientist learns the
behavior of the fuel, the flame and exhaust
through the engine turbine and tail pipe.
The use of photography in research and
the development of new or better products is
but one of the ways it is helping all kinds of
businesses, large and small alike.

The motion picture camera is seeing into a turbo-
jet combustion chamber operating on a new fuel.

that "C" rations
don't spoil
The tin coating on "C" ration cans does not have to
be thick—but it is important that it be evenly dis-
tributed to give sure protection for the contents. But
how can you measure and inspect a coating that's
almost as thin as a shadow?
U. S. Steel does it with the unique X-ray gage you
see in the picture. A beam of X-rays is directed at
the tinplate. The rays penetrate the tin coating and
cause the iron atoms in the steel base to fluoresce and
emit X-rays of their own. As these new X-rays
emerge from the base, they are partially absorbed
by the tin coating. The X-rays finally leaving the
tin are measured by a geiger counter and this reveals
the amount of absorption and, therefore, the coat-
ing weight.
Research work like this is one of the factors that
accounts for the consistent high quality of all types
of steel made by United States Steel.

VNvC this time every semester students be-
thmkim; of faculty evaluations. Some years
choc proceed quite well and produce the de-
mio.1 results or nearly so, but too often the
evaluations don't prompt or allow the student
to uive the instructor the useful and helpful
information he is seeking.
Of great interest to the engineering student
should be the business of two committees in
the College; the Student-Faculty Liaison Com-
mittee and a faculty committee, presently
headed (when the current form was developed)
by Professor Harris, organized for the purpose
of improving education in the College. This
latter committee recently completed a compre-
hensive survey of both faculty and students of
the Engineering College, for the purpose of
determining the criteria held to be important
in teaching by faculty and students alike. The
results are striking; a remarkable similarity in
the thinking of the two groups was found to
exist. Of the original fifty-plus criteria, thirteen
were found to be primary by both students and
faculty. Including among these are subject
knowledge, mannerisms, technique of question-
ing, etc.
The Student-Faculty Liaison Committee
(formed by heads of the Technic, Tau Beta
Pi, and the Engineering Council, in addition to
three faculty members) is using these thirteen
criteria, with additional suggestions from the
committee members, to formulate a question-
naire which should prove to be of considerable
value to instructors in learning accurately stu-
dent opinion of their teaching methods, and,
just as important, student opinion of the course
itself.
The members of the Student-Faculty Liaison
Committee feel that by streamlining the proced-
ure of administering the questionnaire, allow-
ing the student to fill out the forms at home,
providing for classroom discussion (if the in-
structor desires it) of the results before the end
of the semester, and by combining the thirteen
important criteria of good instruction with
suggestions by the committee members and
students and the best ideas in past question-
naires, they can come up with a permanent
answer to this perennial problem. The Engin-
eering Council urges every student to consider
the evaluation seriously and to answer it to the
best of his ability when it takes place in the
very near future.

Why Lockheed-
Lockheed's leadership in aircraft is continuing in missiles. The Missile
Systems Division is one of the largest in the industry and its reputation
is attested by the number of high-priority, long-term projects it holds:
the Polaris IRBM, Earth Satellite, Kingfisher (Q-5) and the X-7.
To carry out such complex projects, the frontiers of technology in all
areas must be expanded. Lockheed's laboratories at Sunnyvale and
Palo Alto, California, provide the most advanced equipment for research
and development, including complete test facilities and one of the
most up-to-date computing centers in the nation. Employee benefits
are among the best in the industry.
For those who qualify and desire to continue their education, the
Graduate Study Program enables them to obtain M.S. or Ph.D degrees
at Stanford or the University of California, while employed in their
chosen fields at Lockheed.
Lockheed Missile Systems Division was recently honored at the first
National Missile Industry Conference as "the organization that
contributed most in the past year to the development of the art of
missiles and astronautics!'

Benjamin. Franklin... on science an J humanity
"The rapid progress true science now makes, occasions
my regretting sometimes that I was born so soon. It is
impossible to imagine the height to which may be
carried, in a thousand years, the power of man over
matter. We may perhaps learn to deprive large masses
of their gravity, and give them absolute levity, for the
sake of easy transport. Agriculture may diminish its
labor and double its produce; all diseases may by sure
means be prevented or cured, not excepting even that
of old age. and our lives lengthened at pleasure even
beyond the antediluvian standard. O that moral science
were in as fair a way of improvement, that men would
cease to be wolves to one another, and that human beings
would at length learn what they now improperly call
humanity!"

Would you like to be a salesman?
Do you enjoy the thrill of selling against strong competition? Would you
like to be in a field where opportunities are limitless? Many of America's
most successful executives started as salesmen. They rose to their present
heights because the bedrock of American business is competition and
the bedrock of competition is selling. At Standard Oil, salesmen are given
a sound background. They spend weeks as salaried sales trainees, learn-

have added or rebuilt 20 laboratories. And the number of scientists has
been more than doubled. Standard scientists are widely known for inven-

sake of easy transport. Agriculture may diminish its

Would you like to be a salesman?
Do you enjoy the thrill of selling against strong competition? Would you
like to be in a field where opportunities are limitless? Many of America's
most successful executives started as salesmen. They rose to their present
heights because the bedrock of American business is competition and
the bedrock of competition is selling. At Standard Oil, salesmen are given
a sound background. They spend weeks as salaried sales trainees, learn-
ing the methods of successful selling.

OCEANOGRAPHIC
INSTITUTION
With the sea destined to play an important
part in our future, several groups, such as the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, are
leading the way in ocean research. by MAX LEGATSKI, '61E
Exhibiting the type of active re-
search an oceanographer must put
up with, this researcher waits for
his instruments to return to the
surface. Small ships and crowded
conditions make oceanographers

Today, oceanography—the study of
the ocean in all its aspects—is of
great importance to man's future well-
being. If we can harness the power, ex-
tract the rare elements, control the wea-
ther, and farm the food from the ocean
efficiently, we will have an almost in-
finite substitute for the rapidly dwindling
resources on land. "Whether it be for
war or peace, the oceans of the world
probably hold the secret to humanity's
future. The nation that unlocks those
mysteries first will direct the future
course of mankind. One of the world's
outstanding ocean-study centers is the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,"
states the New Bedford (Mass.) Stand-
ard-Times.
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
The Woods Hole Oceanographic Insti-
tution was founded in 1930 at Woods
Hole, Massachusetts, at the recommen-
dation of the National Academy of
Sciences. Construction of the first labora-
tory and the first research vessel was
financed by endowments from the Rocke-
feller Foundation, the Carnegie Corpora-
tion, and other donors.
The Institution is dedicated to all
aspects of the study of the sea, including
the great circulation of the oceans, the
characteristics of the bottom and the
margins of the seas, the interactions be-
tween the ocean and the atmosphere, the
chemicals contained in sea water, marine
plant and animal life and their relation
to the marine environment. These aims
require the services of physicists, chem-
ists, geologists, biologists, meteorologists,
hydrologists, and many others, especially
electronic engineers.
Of approximately 70 scientists on the
staff o fthe Institution, about one-half
have university connections. These scien-
tists are assisted by about 250 technical
assistants, artisans, ships officers, and
ships' crewmen. Visiting investigators
are welcomed by the Institution if facil-
ities for their work are available. Projects
are sometimes undertaken in behalf of
government agencies or private indus-
tries on the basis of actual cost, if they
are of scientific value and the results are
allowed to be fully published.
Fellowships are provided annually
which enable about ten graduate students
and younger instructors from the univer-
sities to work on oceanographic prob-
lems during short periods. In addition,
the Associates of the Woods Hole Ocean-
ographic Institution award three fellow-
ships to graduate students to obtain their
doctoral degrees.
During World War II the facilities
of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institu-
tion and the staff were placed at the dis-
posal of the government, attacking such

echo ranging, the submerged operations
of submarines, the effectiveness of under-
water explosions, the prevention of foul-
ing growth on ships, the prediction of
surface conditions for amphibious opera-
tions, and the behavior of smoke screens
over the sea. The Institution's work on
underwater sound was credited by the
government as "having saved many or
our ships," while the anti-fouling studies
were said "to have saved 10 per cent of
the Navy's fuel bill."
Three sea-going research vessels, the
142-foot ketch ATLANTIS, the 125-foot
motor vessel CRAWFORD, and the 103-
foot motor vessel BEAR, are moored in
front of the laboratory at Woods Hole,
while two smaller vessels used for un-
shore work may be harbored in the near-
by boat basin. Two aircraft, a DC3 and
a Stinson Voyager, also form part of the
research fleet. Another ship, the 250-
foot CHAIN, will soon be added.
Oceanography may have begun in the
ocean, just as life itself began in the
ocean, but as with life, oceanography
could not remain confined to the ocean.
To understand the ocean system, ocean-
ography must deal with the combined
aspects and interactions of the land, sea,
and air. An oceanographer may be
specialized in any one field, but he can-
not isolate his branch of the study of the
seas from the study of at least some of
the other sciences. With the understand-
ing that these sciences are actually in-
separable, the author has attempted to
classify his dissertation on oceanography
and the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution into the primary areas of
biology and chemistry, meteorology,
physics, and geology.
Biological and Chemical Research
Chemistry provides one of the more
important keys to the productivity of the
ocean, since the phosphates, nitrates,
potassium salts, etc., are the fertilizers
which control the growth of plants
upon which the higher forms of life
feed. The concentrations of these sub-
stances vary from place to place, depend-
ing upon circulation and other condi-
tions; to understand these concentrations
may well be the first step in farming the
ocean, and is therefore of concern to the
biologist.
The marine biologist is no longer pri-
marily interested in the discovery of un-
known plant and animal life, but instead
he now wants to know what determines
the abundance of life in the ocean and
what controls the distribution of the
various kinds of life. This knowledge is
the key to the productivity of the ocean
—to its possibilities as an increasing
source of food and other valuable prod-
ucts. The biologists must learn in detail
about the life histories of the different
creatures, their food, and their natural
enemies.
The ultimate objective of those who
believe that the ocean can be farmed is
the control of breeding, feeding, and
harvesting; the first requirement towards
this objective is a thorough understanding
of winds and currents, evaporation, dis-
tribution of chemicals, light penetration
in the sea, and their effects upon ocean
life, so that we can eventually study
plankton as sensitive indicators of their
environment.
An interesting area of biological re-
search is the study of sounds made and
heard by fishes. The fact that fish were
capable of hearing was not proven until
1904, when Dr. H. B. Bigelow demon-
strated that severing the auditory nerves
of goldfish eliminated their responses to
sound. Since then it has been proven
that hundreds of fish are not only capa-
ble of hearing, but also of "talking."
Sea robins, for example, produce drum-
ming sounds by drumming on the sides
of an internal air bladder with special
drumming muscles built into the bladder
walls. Despite anatomical and physio-
logical evidence that fishes are sensitive
to sound, and despite the proven ability
of most fishes to produce and hear sound,
it has thus far not been shown that
sounds play an important part in the
lives of these fishes.
Also of great interest to the marine
biologist is the whale, since the whale,
like man, is a bare-skinned mammal. A
recent expedition to the Norwegian
Coast by several members of Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution concentrated
solely on the whale's adaptability to
different temperature extremes. While
being chased, the rate of internal heat
production in a whale may be ten times
that of a whale swimming leisurely, yet
a whale cannot let itself become over-
heated any more than we can; on the
other hand, the same whales are at
home in polar and in warmer waters. At
times, therefore, whales must conserve
heat, and at other times they must dis-
card it. A knowledge of this capability
could conceivably be of great interest to
man.
The blood circulatory system of the
whale, which is the secret of its tempera-
ture adaptability, is an engineering
masterpiece. While layers of blubber in-
sulate the whale's body, the blood in the
tail and flippers have no such protection.
The Norwegian expedition found that
nature has solved this problem by ar-
ranging the whale's arteries and veins in
such a way that they form countercur-
rent heat exchangers, analogous to a
power plant in which outgoing flue gases
are used to heat incoming air. By this
'heat exchanger' arrangement, blood can
be supplied to the cold areas without
sacrificing large amounts of heat to the
surrounding water. The whale discards
heat when necessary by using separate
blood vessels which by-pass these heat
exchangers.

Meteorological Research
Marine meteorologists are studying the
various interactions between air and sea,
such as the exchange of heat and water
vapor, which influence climate, weather,
and the formation of clouds and fog.
A topic of meteorological research is
the development and structure of trade-
wind cumulus clouds. These clouds are
of particular importance because they
play an important role in world-wide
weather by pumping vast quantities of
moisture from the sea into the high
atmosphere; this moisture can then be
carried to the far corners of the earth,
where its condensation gives off heat
which is used as fuel for wind and storm
systems.
The sea and air may be thought of as
interlinked heat engines of very low
efficiency, doing mechanical work against
friction by carrying the working fluids,
sea water and air, from the "firebox" of
the tropics to the radiation-cooled "con-
densors" of the polar regions. The be-
havior of these interlinked heat engines,
which control the weather and climates
throughout the world, is primarily in-
fluenced by four facts; first, is their
shape—they are essentially two thin
sheets wrapped around a sphere; second,
the sphere is rotating, dragging the lower
layers of air with it; third, the ocean is
not a continuous sheet like the atmos-
phere, but is instead broken up by the
continents; fourth, the atmosphere is
stratified in thin layers which do not mix
readily, therefore having different pro-
perties and behaviors.
The energy needed to drive the sea-
air circulation is only a small portion of
incoming solar radiation, and may at
first seem inconsequential from the stand-
point of the power which might theo-
retically be harnessed. But the winds of
the earth have a total kinetic energy
equal to seven million atomic bombs, or
more electric power than could be pro-
duced by all the power plants in the
United States in 100 years. This energy
is replenished every ten days because of
loss by friction between the winds and
the earth.
Physical Research
The principal interest of the physical
oceanographer is the study of the circu-
lation of the water masses of the ocean.
This is a huge problem, calling for years
of ship's time and many people. During
IGY, ships of the Woods Hole Oceano-
graphic Institution and the British Na-
tional Institute of Oceanography are
making a determined effort to obtain a
better knowledge of the circulation of
the North and South Atlantic Ocean.
Observations are being made on east-
west crossings along each 20° of lati-
tude.
The circulation of the sea is caused
both by prevailing winds and by the
thermal differences between the low and
high latitudes, and is influenced by the
earth's rotation and the land masses.
One of the principal interests of phy-
sical oceanographers, as well as meteoro-
logical oceanographers, is the circulation
of the ocean. The first actual theoriza-
tion of the probable factors of ocean
circulation might be accredited to a paper
published by Goldsbrough in 1933-
Although there were several seemingly
insurmountable restrictions in Colds-
brough's theory at the time, new con-
cepts gradually evolved and were formal-
ly realized by Henry Stommel, of Woods
Hole Oceanographic Institution, in 1955.
Stommel theorized the existence of a
deep countercurrent under the Gulf
Stream. In 1957 an expedition verified
Stommel's theory, calling for a major
revision in the fundamental concepts of
dynamic oceanography. According to
Stommel's thermohaline theory, this
countercurrent is a result of changes in
temperature and salinity, with the earth's
curvature and rotation also being im-
portant factors; previous theories had
been based almost solely on major wind
systems.
In addition to ships, one of the most
valuable tools of the physical oceano-
grapher is the airplane, which is being
used by Woods Hole scientists for such
programs as marine meterology, mapping
the sea surface, and the use of a radia-
tion thermometer which measures the
temperature of the sea's surface from
the air.
The latter of these instruments has
proved to be a great success and has
been useful in the study of the Gulf
Stream. Since an airplane can cover a
much wider area than a ship, airborne
oceanographers have been able to plot
the edges of the Gulf Stream and other
currents much more accurately than is
possible from a ship. Using the radiation
thermometer to study small scale surface
temperature fluctuations in the Caribbean
has made it possible to correlate warm
patches on the surface with individual
trade-wind cumulus clouds.
Another method permitting the air-
borne oceanographer to make physical
measurements is the use of buoys. These
small expendible bouys are usually com-
parable to the more familiar earth satel-
lites, equipped with instruments which
are designed to transmit various types of
information by radio. These buoys might,
of course, be provided with enough power
to transmit directly to shore, but at
present it seems economical to use smaller

NAVAL ARCHITECTURE
and
MARINE ENGINEERING
Although one of the smallest departments at
Michigan, the Department of Naval Architec-
ture and Marine Engineering is the largest of
its kind in the world.
There are few industries which have
done as much to change the his-
tory of the world as the ship building
industry. For many centuries the supreme
countries in the world have usually had
the stronger navies, and it is only with
the very recent developments of the air-
plane and automobile that some of the
attention has been taken away from the
shipping industry. However, although
people might not be so "conscious" of
ships in this present age, the industry
has been steadily growing.
Naval architects and marine engineers
are in more demand today than ever
before. One of the reasons for this is
that accelerating technology in the field
has rapidly outmoded old ships. In per-
vious years, a ship would not "go out of
fashion" for many years, but that is no
longer true. Ships do not become out-
moded as rapidly as the new automo-
biles, of course, but many rapid ad-
vances are being made throughout the
industry. For example, there are now
new methods of power which are being
directly applied to ships. Everyone has
heard of the nuclear powered ships
which have fairly recently been devel-
oped. There are also other new sources
of power such as gas turbine and free
piston gas turbine engines propelling
ships through the seas.
Cargo Handling
Cargo handling is changing too. The
newest thing is "containerization" of
cargo. In this process, a tractor-trailer
truck pulls along beside the ship. Then
its van is completely removed with the
cargo still intact and placed in the ship.
When the ship reaches its destination,
the "containers" are placed upon other
trailers and driven off without ever hav-
ing touched the contents. Since a ship
spends from one-half to two-thirds of
its time in port, anything to speed up
cargo handling is very valuable. Most
surprising of all though are the tremen-
dous advances which have been made
in size. In 1948, the largest super tankers
had a capacity of 30,000 tons. Today
they are able to transport up to 85,000
tons—nearly three times as much. Not
only are there ships of that size now,
but plans have been drawn for ships of
over 100,000 ton capacity. Many skilled
engineers are needed to keep pace with
this dynamic industry.
The industry today relies basically
upon the naval architect and the marine
engineer. The naval architect is pri-
marily concerned with the design and
construction of ship hulls, while the
marine engineer's realm includes the de-
sign and construction of the propelling
equipment, and the general problem of
heat transference. However, these jobs
are in practice rather interchangeable be-
cause the naval architect often holds a
degree in marine engineering and con-
versely.

U of M Has Largest Program
The University of Michigan now has
the largest undergraduate degree pro-
gram in Naval Architecture and Marine
Engineering in the United States. This
year there are seventy-seven undergrad-
uate students and seven graduate students
in the department here at the University.
This was a slight decrease over the en-
rollment of last year, but looking at it
from an overall point of view, the
department has been steadily growing
since its inception. Although it may not
be the largest department at the Uni-
versity of Michigan, it may well be the
friendliest. Each of the four professors,
all of whom hold N.A. and M.E. de-
grees, is personally acquainted with the
students in the program and the normal
formality between professors and stu-
dents is nonexistant. This friendly atmos-
phere is one of the most highly valued
assets of the department and serves to
give the students the benefits of the
closeness of a small school with the
facilities of a large university.
While taking drawing courses, each
student is assigned his own desk in the
large well lighted drawing room. This
is the "heart" of the department, and
he will spend many hours there at his
desk. A unique feature is that the doors
of West Engineering Building are never
closed to the students in the Naval Ar-
chitecture and Marine Engineering De-

partment. Those who have work to do
can obtain a pass key and go up to the
drawing room at any time. In fact many
students virtually "live" in the drawing
room. They may be found there during
the noon hour or in the evening or some-
time late into the night. Anytime that
they want to do some drawing, they
are free to go up to the drawing room.
The department has always had a lot
of foreign students. At the present time
about one-third of the department is com-
posed of students from outside of the
United States. It may be interesting to
note that about one-half of these were
sent here for study by the Turkish Navy.
Started As Option
From 1881 until 1889, Marine Engi-
neering was just an option branch of the
Mechanical Engineering Department. At
that time the College of Engineering
established a full curriculum in Marine
Engineering, and the course of Mechani-
cal Engineering was changed to Me-
chanical Engineering and Iron Shipbuild-
ing. Mortimer Cooley, later Dean of the
Engineering School, taught the first

courses in Marine Engineering. In 1900
Herbert C. Sadler from the University
of Glasgow, Scotland, joined the Uni-
versity staff. In 1904, the tank and all
of its equipment, entirely designed by
Prof. Sadler, was installed. This offi-
cially inaugurated the Department of
Naval Architecture and Marine Engineer-
ing.
The Naval Tank
The naval tank, the largest college
facility of its kind in the world, is housed
in the West Engineering Building. It
was originally built 300 feet long, 22
feet wide, and 10 feet deep. Its sides

and bottom are completely concrete, with
the bottom arched and reinforced with
expanded metal. A concrete bracket runs
along each side to carry the rails for the
towing car. Since the time that it was
built, 60 more feet have been added, so
the tank is now 360 feet long. Early
models which were used in the tank were
made of wax, but due to warping, this
was discontinued. Now the models are
wooden. However, the wax process has
been so improved that it may soon be
used again.
As was said before, Michigan has the
largest undergraduate degree program in
the United States. There are only two
other schools which offer such a program,
M.I.T. and Webb Institute of Naval Ar-
chitecture in Glen Cove, L.I. Michigan's
enrollment approximately equals that of
the other two schools combined. There
are more schools, however which have
graduate programs. Among them are
the University of California at Berkeley
and Stevens Institute of Technology in
Hoboken, N.J.
There are two societies which a stu-
dent in N.A. or M.E. may join. The
local society is called the Quarterdeck
Society and has been on campus for many
years. This is a student run professional
society, and the person who desires to
join must submit an original paper to
be aprpoved by a committee. If his
paper is approved, he is accepted into the
society. About one-third of the depart-
ment belongs to Quarterdeck. The other
two-thirds for various reasons do not

SEAWAY
After surmounting numerous problems and set-
backs, the U. S. and Canada have finally
opened the Midwest to ocean-going vessels. by JAY SKLAR, '60E
Cleveland, Toledo, Toronto . . . huge
industrial cities of America. These
three cities and all the others located
on the shores of the Great Lakes have
looked first with envy on the coastal
production areas in New York and Cal-
ifornia and then with frustration at the
expansive bodies of water lying before
them. Ever since the Mesabi Range with
its rich deposits of iron ore has become
the mainstay of industry in the United
States, and since manufacturing has been
centered around it, there has existed a
simple problem of transportation. This
difficulty has limited the industrial devel-
opment of these cities. One might say
that industry has reached a tremendous
level already, but there has always been
the transportation problem. If the high
cost of an export trade were reduced,
production would increase manifold in
the areas bordering on the Great Lakes.
Although the cost of rail transporta-
tion is not excessive, shipping to for-
eign ports involves first a railroad ship-
ment to a coastal port and then trans-
ferring the cargo to a ship. The extra
labor required for this job increases the
cost of industrial export to the point
where this activity is immeasurably re-
stricted. Developing an inland waterway
to the Great Lakes would be ideal.
Started in 1954
In 1954, the United States and Can-
ada agreed to open up the St. Lawrence
River as such a waterway. By utilizing
a series of locks, the turbulent waters
would be quieted and safe passage to
the sea would be assured. In addition,
strategically placed dams would yield
millions of horsepower in electric power
for both countries.
One must be aware, however, that
this project is not the first attempt to
bring foreign ports closer to the Great
Lakes cities. As long ago as 1825, the
United States government completed the
Erie canal connecting Lake Erie with
the Hudson River. Then in 1850, an-
other path to the sea was added. Cana-
dian interests constructed two canals, the
St. Lawrence and the Welland to connect
Montreal with Lake Erie. These water-
ways were only deep enough for those
boats drawing less than nine feet of
water. In 1904, these were deepened to
fourteen feet.
The next step in developing a route
for ocean-going vessels was undertaken
by the United States as a canal and
locks were built at St. Mary's River near
Sault Ste. Marie. This permitted nine-
foot navigation from the lakes to the sea.
In 1933, Canada completed the Wel-
land Ship Canal to a depth of twenty-
five feet. The way was then ready for
the presently proposed St. Lawrence

the most vital step, since it will enable
ocean-going vessels to reach the Great
Lakes for the first time.
Five Major Sections
The construction work on the river is
divided into five major sections. Since
Montreal is already serviced by the re-
quired twenty-seven foot channels, it is
necessary to extend westward from that
city. The first portion, known as the
Lachine Section, is thirty-one miles long.
Here, there exists rapids too treacherous
for navigation. Although there is at
present a canal bypassing these waters,
its depth of fourteen feet is insufficient.
Instead, a new navigation canal will be
built including two locks to lower the
water level forty-eight feet.
The next area, the Soulanges Section,
is only sixteen miles long. Two more
locks and a deepened channel are being
added. On the Lake St. Francis Section,
the Canadian government is dredging the
existing waterways to give the required
twenty-seven foot depth. The fourth
section, the International Rapids area,
continues forty-four miles westward.
Here the work to be completed is most
extensive and costly; estimated expense
is $600 million. Included are:
1) A dam and associated power house
will back up the river enough to flood
communities so that plans for resettle-
ment in dry areas are necessary. Two new
towns are being built from the popula-
tion of these areas.
2) Dikes will restrain the river from
flooding more villages.
3) A control dam will maintain the
desired water level in the pool.
4) Navigation canals will be pro-
vided.
Finally, the United States will under-
take a small amount of dredging in the
Thousand Islands section. This will clear
the area of rocky shoals and increase
depth to the minimum of twenty-seven
feet.
Size Hard to Imagine
The reader should be aware of the
project's size. In one small section two
million cubic yards of material will be
dredged; in another, fourteen million.
There are places where a million cubic
yards of rock will be rough cut to make
way for the deepened waterway. Thous-
ands of pieces of equipment are being
used to complete the work on schedule.
Rehabilitation is necessary for 6,500
people whose homes will be under up to
eighty feet of water by the time the

Seaway is complete. To supply cement
for dam abutments, a concrete mixing
plant has been constructed. In many
areas, transporting material is unneces-
sary since the excavations double as
quarries to supply sand and gravel for
the concrete. The fantastic size of the
program is hard to imagine. The statistics
above represent only a very small part
of the total effort, but even these figures
are momentous.
In a project of such size, there are
thousands of problems for civil, marine,
mechanical and industrial engineers. To
solve them, cost is usually of little ob-
ject, and many unusual methods are
often necessary. One of the first problems
faced by the contractors was that of
determining a map of the river bottom.
Generally, the best method is to utilize
small boats equipped with echo sounders.
The time difference between a trans-
mitted wave and its echo is noted and
the depth automatically recorded on a
fathometer. However, in the many areas
of swift water, this technique was im-
possible. Instead, meteorological balloons
with piano wire and lead sinkers tied
below were used. Determining the
height of the balloon was equivalent to
determining the depth of the water.
Another method employed included
helicopter sounding systems. These three
methods then gave the civil engineers
a complete mapping of the river bed.
Problems Overcome
A wide variety of soil problems pre-
sented themselves during the course of
the project. As one reads a progress re-
port such as the one appearing in the
April, 1956 issue of Roads and Engin-
eering Constructions, one is impressed
by the tremendous amount of blasting
required. A vein of glacial till runs
across the required excavations in many
places. The entire channel 1300 feet
across and three miles long had to be
blasted away in a part of the Interna-
tional Rapids section.
Further glacial action deposited huge
twenty-five foot diameter boulders here
and there in the excavations. Too widely
spread for full scale blasting, these had
to be dynamited individually.
Clay, occurring in abundance in the
International Rapids section, presented a
stiff problem. In warm weather, the
clay became soupy and impossible to
handle. But in winter, the soup solidified

and draglines could be used. The roads
also froze preventing many trucking
problems that would otherwise occur.
Trouble occurred of the weather was too
cold, though. The clay froze to the truck
bodies and had to be dug out of them.
Heating the trucks with their own ex-
haust helped prevent this.
Aside from the soil, nature presents
many other problems. Cold is one of the
biggest. Concrete pouring in winter is a
tricky operation. To prevent the mixture
from freezing in transit, the truck bodies
require heating with exhaust. The rib-
bing of the body is made into a con-
tinous flow pipe which the gases
traverse before leaving the rear of the
truck. Special fittings keep the circula-
tion constant except when dumping
occurs.
Since many areas of construction were
under water, the St. Lawrence River had
to be diverted in several instances to
allow construction crews to pour dams
and deepen channels. This was one of
the most ticklish operations in the entire
project. Due to the many cities along

pleted Dwight D. Eisenhower Lock

the river, the water level had to be
maintained with a tolerance of two feet.
Excessive or deficient water level would
endanger a city or ruin its sanitation
system. Extreme care was necessary to
avoid radical changes. In one instance,
as the water was being diverted from
one cut to another, ice kept the levels
from adjusting properly. By rapidly
opening and closing the gates of a dam,
the engineers created huge swells under
the ice which served to crack it. Such
emergency methods are typical of the in-
genuity employed by the projectmen.

can see the enclosure dikes and nearly

Vast Expense
To offset the fantastic expense of the
project, both the Canadian and the
United States governments will con-
tribute. Canada will pay $200 million
and the United States $105 million of
the navigation costs. The $600 million
needed to install the hydroelectric sta-
tions will be equally divided between
the two countries. In addition, a system
of tolls will help pay the high price of
industrial growth. These tolls will be
calculated to cover operating and main-
tenance of the Seaway and to enable the
St. Lawrence Seaway Development Cor-
poration to amortize the principal of its
debts within fifty years. As yet, no rates
have been announced.
Thus, the Great Lakes will finally
be accessible for ocean-going vessels.
Already, its widespread importance is
being accepted as the major cities are
building dock and harbor facilities.
Before long, America will have its in-
land ports, and the dream started in
1825 with the Erie Canal, that of bring-
ing international shipping to the Great
Lakes, will become a reality.

Engineering careers all over the
Many young engineers who join Western Electric find
themselves working not too far from home ... for there
are 22 Western Electric manufacturing plants across the
country. But wherever these engineers are located, they
share in exciting assignments that stem from our job as
manufacturing and supply unit of the Bell System.
Since our work is geared to a continual demand for
more and better telephone equipment, Western Electric
engineers are constantly exploring relatively new techni-
cal fields. Some current examples: electronic switching,
miniaturization, microwave radio relay, semiconductors,
automation. They also pioneer in working with metals
and alloys, raw materials, testing devices, chemical proc-
esses and the like.
Added to challenging assignments like these in produc-
tion techniques and processes is our nation-wide distribu-
tion job. Here, engineers have key roles in devising
systems for the supply and repair of telephone equipment.
Elsewhere, telephone central office equipment is installed
in thousands of cities and towns each year using tools,
test sets and methods devised by Western Electric engi-
neers. They also work with our purchasing people in
buying the things needed by the Bell System. And they
are responsible for engineering those defense projects
assigned us by the government because of our specialized
experience. Example: the U. S. Army's Nike guided
missile systems.

To help our engineers keep abreast of technical
advancements, we recently set up three special full-time,
off-the-job study centers — in New York, Chicago and
Winston-Salem, N. C. Here Western Electric engineers
delve into such subjects as computers and semiconductors.
This kind of training helps to insure professional growth.
What's the future for the management-minded Western
Electric engineer? Consider these facts: 55% of the col-
lege graduates in our upper levels of management today
have engineering degrees ... in the next ten years some
7,000 key positions will have to be filled by newly pro-
moted people, engineers included.

POWER
As industry continues to expand rapidly and
demand more and more electricity, we may
soon have to call on power from the sea.
by CARL PAGE, '60E
Power drives the mechanisms of civ-
ilization, lifting the more fortunate
part of the two billion inhabitants of
the earth to unprecendented material
advantages. But modern society consumes
power at an ever increasing rate. Fossil
fuels, coal, wood, and petroleum, are
being depleted. Even the complete devel-
opment of atomic power from the process
of fission will not satisfy the power
needs forever. From present knowledge
of the world supply of heavy fissionable
material, it is estimated that the "atomic
power" supplied by advanced nuclear
reactors will also be depleted in 50,000
years. So eventually, civilization must
either find new sources of power or ad-
just to a less dynamic environment.
But now, the vast swirling waters of
the seas may provide as much power as
any civilization will ever need. All sur-
face waters contain small amounts of
heavy water, the hydrogen of heavy
water being the basic ingredient of the
hydrogen or fusion bomb. In the hydro-
gen bomb, heavy hydrogen is heated to
a high temperature by a fission explosion.
The hydrogen is transmuted into helium
and enormous amounts of energy are
released. Deuterium (hydrogen of mass
2) which is used in this reaction can be
separated from sea water for about 3
cents per gallon now. And there is
enough deuterium in the oceans to sus-
tain an energy production rate of 1000
times the present capacity of the world
for one billion years if a reasonably
efficient thermonuclear power system
could be devised.
The Race for Controlled Fusion
Most of the great powers began their
fusion research programs in about 1951
in the shadows of great secrecy. But in
1955 at the International Conference on
Atomic Energy at Geneva, Dr. Homi
Bhabda of India and Chairman of the
conference predicted controlled fusion
within the next 20 years. Subsequently,
the United States and Russia released
information pertaining to their fusion
research programs.
At present, the race for controlled
fusion seems to involve three world pow-
ers, Great Britain, the United States
and the USSR. From the standpoint of
results we know about, Great Britain
probably leads the world. Temperatures
of almost 5 million degrees have been
produced in their fusion tubes at the
Harwell Laboratories, and intense neu-
tron emission has occured for hundreds
of seconds from the fusion materials.
However, it is usually conceded that the
United States, the USSR, and Great
Britain are all very nearly equal in
capability.
Great Value Now
Besides solving the power problems of
future generations, the controlled fusion
of heavy hydrogen would be of great
value now. Power is essential for the

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


particularly when it is at war or eternally
mobilized for war. Also, fusion has fea-
tures which make it more desirable than
fission as a source of power. Long-lived
radioactive isotopes are formed by fission
reactors; they represent a very real dan-
ger in case of an accident. Fusion reac-
tions produce relatively short-lived
radioactive materials. Present calculations
show that fusion plants would be very
safe. The chance of a runaway or an
explosion would be about the same as
for coal power plants. Finally, schemes
are under development which would
convert heat energy directly into elec-
tricity without heating a liquid to drive
a turbo-generator. Hence, because of its
inherent advantages over fission as a
source of power, and the state of inter-
national affairs, fusion power would be
valuable now.
Problems of Fusion Research
Incredibly difficult technical problems
must be solved before any controlled
fusion reaction can occur. To cause a
fusion reaction, one must in essence
duplicate the conditions of the face of
the sun. The heavy hydrogen must be
heated until the electrons and nuclei are
torn apart and the nuclei are moving at
high velocities. Necessary temperatures
are on the order of 100,000,000 degrees
centigrade, enough to vaporize upon con-
tact any material whatsoever. Once
practical solutions are found for the
high ignition temperature and the con-
tainment problem, there is still the prob-
lem of getting the power from the
reaction and transfering it to some use-
ful function.
Amazing progress has been made
upon the first two of these problems,
ignition temperature and containment.
However, while some basic research has
been successful, much more must be
done before a workable fusion reactor
is constructed.
One of the most common schemes for
fusion uses a mixture of deuterium
(hydrogen of mass 2) and tritium
(hydrogen of mass 3) to lower the
ignition temperature and to raise the
reaction rate by a factor of one hundred
over the reaction rate of pure deuterium.
The equation of the nuclear chemical
reaction looks like this:
,R- 4- ,H3 -&gt; ,He4 + „n' + 17.6 mev.
In the above reaction note that for
every helium nucleus formed, a neutron,
"on1", is released along with 17.6 mev.
of energy.
In order to contain the agitated fluid
of nuclei and electrons, called "plasma"
by the physicists, an elementary fact
about the behavior of a charged particle
is used. (Refer to the diagram). A
charged particle moving in a uniform
magnetic field tends to travel in a helix
around a field line. The particles are con-
tained in a "magnetic bottle," so to speak,
as they tend to follow the same field line.
If one designs a magnetic field in a torus
(or doughnut shape) then one can con-
struct a "bottle" which will keep most of

the charged particles from ever touching
the sides of the enclosure.
If, because of several complicating
effects, an ion should crash into the side
of the enclosure, atoms of the material
are knocked off. Since the contaminating
atoms are heavy and moving slowly, they
absorb some of the energy of the gas as
they are accelerated by collisions. Conse-
quently, the temperature of the gas
decreases and the fusion temperature is
not reached. Various methods are being
tried to trap contaminating atoms before
they "cool off" the reaction too much,
but this is still a difficult technical prob-
lem.
The Plasma Stream
The plasma stream is itself a relatively
new topic of interest to the physicists.
All the mathematics for predicting its
behavior has not been done. As well,
many strange new effects are found as
the temperatures of the plasmas increase.
For example, a surprisingly large dis-
charge of neutrons from the plasma at
about a million degrees centigrade
tricked some scientists in Great Britain
and in Japan into concluding that they
had performed the reaction given by the
equation in the earlier part of this
article. However, now it seems that the
discharge of neutrons is a strange proper-
ty of the plasma itself at high tempera-
tures.
A highly useful facet of plasma be-
havior was predicted by theory. The
"pinch effect," as it is called, predicted
that the flow of heavy currents through
a hot gas will generate powerful mag-
netic fields in the gas which will com-
press the gas, making it hotter. This
turned out to be true and offers one
method of producing ultra-high temper-
atures as well as a reasonable method of
containment.
Thus far, the greatest problems con-
nected with fusion research have been
the erratic movement of the plasma after
it reaches about 1 million degrees. The
compressing magnetic fields are distorted
and the plasma crashes into the walls of
the tube, loosing its energy.
New Fusion Machines
The United States and Great Britain
announced some information on new
fusion machines at the September, 1957,
Geneva Conference on the atom. All of
the machines use the "magnetic bottle"
and the "pinch effect" to some extent.
In the table below is a summary of the
performances of the American and Brit-
ish machines.

THE NAUTILUS
Fulfilling the expectations of the nuclear physi-
cist, the Nautilus is destined to have a bright
future in the defense of America.
by SUE OH, '61E
When, early last August, the world's
first nuclear submarine, Nautilus,
made her modest way under the polar
icecap, passing within a few miles of the
easternmost part of Siberia, the future of
a fleet of such miracle-boats suddenly be-
came vitally important to Americans and,
no doubt, to Russians. How the historic
voyage was accomplished in the first
place is not so important from the mili-
tary viewpoint as it is interesting to the
layman. However, the solution of some
of the problems of the trip gives a clue
to the role Nautilus and her sister ships
will play in future warfare.
Foremost Problem
Probably the foremost problem in the
Pole trip was that of navigation. Navi-
gation anywhere on the surface of the
oceans can be only so accurate, but when
the ship is under the surface, and right
at the North Pole, matters are compli-
cated somewhat.
Ordinary navigation makes use of mag-
netic and gyrocompasses, and celestial
observations. A newer method of deter-
mining one's position is sonar, in which
a ship lines up on radio beams from
two points. Near the poles, the magnetic
compass is completely unreliable; even
the gyrocompass is somewhat inaccurate
and often gets confused by changes in
speed of the ship. If one is under the
icecap, celestial sights are impossible to
take. Therefore, a new navigational sys-
tem was developed for Nautilus, called
the Inertial Gravitational System. It has
three great advantages over the other
methods: (1) Extreme accuracy without
help from earth or sky, (2) Interference-
proof operation, (3) Radio silence is
maintained (no signals are sent out).
The I.G.S. is made of two parts; one
is a Schuler electronic pendulum which
is so constructed as to always point to-
ward the center of the earth. The other
is a conventional gyrocompass which
maintains its plane of rotation, if the
bearings are as frictionless as possible.
The position relative to the starting point
is determined by measuring the angle be-
tween the indicators of the two parts.
The system also has a full complement
of accelerometers, which measure change
of speed; chronometers, precision clocks;
besides several integrators and trackers.
Actually, the navigation of the trip con-
sisted in dead-reckoning (a method of
determining position from courses sailed
and the distance of each) on the instru-
ments for 1,830 miles, quite a feat of
seamanship.
Other Nautilus' equipment consisted
of no less than 13 sonar devices, includ-
ing fathometers, and a sonar detecting
device so sensitive that it is "able to
perceive a small bird in the water at a
distance of one half mile." A closed-
circuit television camera was installed
which took continuous pictures of the
bottom of the ice pack.
The obvious point of the Pole trip,
from the military viewpoint, is the fact
that a missile-carrying submarine can get

Siberia with the best protection in the
world, i.e. the feet-thick polar icecap.
This area is close enough to make the
1,500 mile Polaris quite effective, if need
be . The advantageous position under the
ice is, after all, only a result of the
innate qualities of the nuclear subma-
rine; these are the qualities that make
the submarine as it was meant to be . . .
truly at home under the surface.
Nuclear vs. Conventional
It has been said that anything a con-
ventional submarine can do, a nuclear
sub can do better, faster and longer. As
more official reports of nuclear subs
come in, the statement appears all the
more true. However, one should know
something about conventional submarines
to appreciate all the advantages of the
new ones.
A conventional submarine must have
two complete power plants, a diesel en-
gine for surface running, and a storage
battery system for beneath the surface.
This is simply because insufficient oxygen
is present for the combustion in a diesel
engine. At the outset, this constitutes a
problem of excess weight. Since the sub-
marine has two power plants, it needs
double the weight allowance for pro-
pulsion that a surface ship needs.
The diesel engine is satisfactory on
the surface, although a submarine is not
considered a fast boat* and often can
not keep up with its convoy. The real
hardship develops when the sub must
submerge and rely solely on batter power
for speed and maneuverability, as well as
for light and instruments. A submarine's
lack of speed undersea, it is said, is its
greatest tactical deficiency." A subma-
rine can run at full speed, around 12
knots, for about an hour before it must
surface to recharge its batteries. The
other alternative is that the sub stay
below for as long as 48 hours, running
at 2 knots, barely sufficient to maintain
steerageway. Under these conditions, a
submarine is at a real disadvantage if
attempting to chase a surface ship while
submerged. There is danger in that a
submarine can't maneuver quickly enough
to dodge depth charges every time. A
depth charge is lethal within a radius
of 80 feet. Even a single bullet hole can
ruin the pressure inside; the submarine
is not armor-plated for weight consid-
erations. If time runs out on battery
power, the submarine may be forced to
surface under the enemy's nose. In the
♦Correct nautical terminology; a submarine
is a boat, not a ship.
case of the submarine, there is safety in
depth; until now, submarines have been
limited in this respect ,also.
A New Era
Nautilus has brought a new era. With
a wealth of nuclear power, she can re-
main submerged almost indefinitely (a
sister ship, Seawolf, has entered a new-
record of 60 days independent of the
earth's atmosphere); she can travel at
full speed all the time, if that is desired
—all this without any concern for fuel.
One pound of enriched uranium will
supply the BTU's that either 300,000
gallons of fuel oil or 2,300 tons of coal
will. A nuclear submarine uses about
one pound of fuel a month, and is re-
fueled about once a year. The nuclear
energy not only propels trie boat, but
runs all the instruments, appliances, and
lights. Even the jukebox aboard the
Nautilus depends on the reactor. Inci-
dentally, the jukebox, and other amuse-
ments are not unnecessary weight and a
these subs is probably the type that will
man our spaceships.
In the Nautilus, nuclear power makes
possible the very efficient steam turbines.
They apply uniform rotational force
directly to the shaft. Furthermore, with
steam there are no exhaust fumes to con-
tent with. The same water is used over
and over again with the help of the
condensers.
Nautilus is capable of speeds exceed-
ing 25 knots submerged, roughly double
that of a conventional submarine; she
can descend deeper than 400 feet, and
the deeper a sub can go, the safer she is.
Problems and Disadvantages
The problems and disadvantages of
going to sea with a reactor are not in-
considerable. An invaluble aid to re-
search and the solutions of these prob-

the reactor compartment and the engine
room. This particular reactor is called
"thermal" because the neutrons are
slowed to the thermal speed of molecules
in ordinary matter. This is accomplished
by using hydrogen, a very good neutron-
stopper, in the form of water, as a
coolant.
In the reactor compartment, the heart
of the power plant, the "core,' is sur-
rounded by a very thick shield, called
the primary shield. The core is a lump
of U238, enriched with the fissionable
U235. The primary coolant system is the
pipes which carry distilled water (in the
Nautilus) into the core to be heated, to
the pressurizer so that it won't turn into
steam, to the heat exchanger, where it
heats the water of the secondary coolant
system, and back to the pumps to be put
through the cycle again. The primary
coolant is radioactive through contact
with the reactor pile. Therefore, this
entire area is shielded with lead, called the
secondary shield. From the engine room,
pipes which carry the secondary coolant
pass through the lead wall into the
heat exchanger where the water becomes
superheated steam. This water is not
radioactive and can be piped back out
of the reactor compartment into the tur-
bines. All openings in the lead wall are
carefully sealed and checked constantly
for leaks.
The system is basically quite simple;
however, the weight of the reactor and
the shielding constitute a problem of
buoyancy. Naturally, the weight of the
submarine may not exceed the amount
indicated by its displacement; therefore,
the area to be enclosed by shielding
must be as small as possible. Further-
more, the center of gravity must be kept
as low in the boat as possible, so the
submarine can dive quickly. The reactor
is placed low in the boat on the center-
line and at a point where it can easily
be counterbalanced by torpedoes or other
machinery in another part of the boat.
Second Aspect
A second important aspect of the sea-
going reactor is the safety of its ship-
mates. The amount of radiation a crew-
may be subject to is a function of the
thickness of the shielding. The thick-
ness of the shield depends mostly on (1)
the specified radiation level. (2) the
material used for shielding, and (3) the
primary coolant.
Theoretically, no amount of shielding
will reduce the radiation count to zero.
This is because the radiation count de-
creases by some factor for every inch of
shielding, depending on the material
used. It is up to someone to say how
much radiation would be allowable. For-
tunately, the limits prescribed by the
AEC for civilians are adhered to at sea.
The particles to be stopped are fast
neutrons and gamma rays. Since hydro-
gen is an excellent neutron absorber,
plastics, hydrocarbons, and water are
possible shielding materials. For stop-
ping gamma rays, most substances are
about the same on a weight basis. Mate-
rials were tested to determine if a more
effective shield than lead were possible.
Tungsten, uranium, and boron carbide
were found to save 5% of the weight
of the plant, but the cost of such shield-
ing is prohibitive. As it stands, lead
saves 20% of the weight over steel.
The third consideration which affects
shield thickness is the choice of primary
coolant. Some coolants retain radioactive
products longer than others, and some let
particles pass through it easily. Molten
sodium is the coolant in Seawolf's SIR
(Submarine Intermediate Reactor); its
main advantage is that the same amount
of shaft horsepower delivered by a pres-
surized water system can be produced by
the molten sodium system with only 85%
of the reactor power.
Below, the radioactivity and radiation
levels of water and sodium as primary
coolants are compared:

integration per second.
In water, the fission produces decay
quickly, while in sodium, the rate is con-
siderably slower.
Shielding Important
More than adequate shielding is neces-
sary to protect the crew, so a battery of
radiation monitoring instruments are in-
stalled, such as air particle detectors
inside and outside of the secondary
shield, gamma ray detectors, and boiler-
leak detectors. The control system neces-
sary to any reactor is not neglected,
covering such accidents as boiler break-
down, pump failure, and of course, too
high a degree of fission. In the Nautilus,
the control rods are made of hafnium,
a rare metal which is a very good neu-
tron absorber. The control rods adjust
the balance between neutrons produced
and neutrons absorbed. If all neutrons
produced were absorbed immediately, the
control system would have to be geared
to act in microseconds. Since many neu-
trons are delayed by radioactive particle
decay, the control system need only act
in seconds.
The inaccessibility of the reactor com-
partment seems to be an irremediable
problem. While the reactor is running,
the compartment cannot be entered. How-
ever, if it is running, there seems to be
no reason for anyone to want to enter it.
If water is used as the primary coolant,
in case of breakdown, the compartment
can be entered almost immediately after
shutoff for necessary repairs.
Since the problems of adapting nuclear
power to submarines have, in the main,
been solved, the atomic submarine is
destined to become one of the most

SUBMARINES: Their History
by KEN DEC, '61E
With the recent passage of the atomic
powered submarine "Nautilus"
under the polar ice cap, much of the
attention of the world has been turned
toward the submarine and its importance
in naval warfare. Never before since
World Wars I and II has the submarine
experienced such a rise in prestige as a
lethal naval weapon. This rise in im-
portance within the last 50 years has
led some people to believe that the sub-
marine is a recent invention, developed
specifically for modern warfare. This
however is not the case, for the first
submersibles appeared over 2000 years
ago, and the first submarines about
200 years ago. As in any technological
development, the submarine has come
into being only through the research and
development, success and failure of many
early inventors and scientists.
Early Submersibles
The time, place, purpose, or even
the name of the inventor of the first
submersible has never been definitely
established, but it is said in legend that
Alexander the Great descended to the
bottom of the ocean floor in a water-
tight glass barrel which was lowered by
means of ropes, and sat there defying a
whale. The part of the story about the
whale seems a bit questionable, but the
description of the method used makes
this feat seem quite possible. This being
the case, and until contrary information
is discovered, we may bestow upon
Alexander the distinction of being the
first person to attempt submerging below
the sea in a water tight compartment.
Early history gives evidence of divers'
air tubes, divers' helmets, and diving
bells used by the ancient nations border-
ing the Mediterranean. In 480 B.C. a
Greek diver named Scyllias and his
daughter played an important role in
the defeat of the Persian fleet by cutting
their anchor cables during a storm.
Aristotle mentions that divers and diving
bells were used by Alexander when he
beseiged Tyre in 332 B.C.
Many instances like these may be
found scattered through history. In all
cases the "submarines" of this time were
only reinforced chambers moved along
the bottom of shallow bodies of water
by various methods of propulsion. The
chambers were usually covered with oil
soaked leather and propelled by oars pro-
truding through water tight oar locks.
These early submersibles were not sub-
marines in the strict sense of the word,
for they were simple vessels used under
water for peaceful purposes. The sub-
marine as it is known today is intended
solely as an implement of war.
First Submarines
The submarine for war purposes only,
is an American innovation. The first one
was built in Connecticut in 1775 by Dav-
id Bushneli. Bushneli devoted much of
his early research to the development of
a gunpowder which would explode
under water. After the perfection of this
explosive, he went on to design a sub-
mersible which could deliver a charge
of it to ships at anchor.
Bushnell's submarine was called the
"Turtle," because, he said, it was shaped
like one. Here the similarity ends, for the
"Turtle" floated in a verticle rather than
a horizontal position. It was seven feet
long, four feet wide, and eight feet
high. When on surface, the conning
tower protruded about eight inches out
of the water. This conning tower con-
tained six glass ports instead of a peri-
scope.
Much of the equipment in the
"Turtle" was the forerunner of equip-
ment used in modern day submarines.
There was a depth gauge, magnetic
compass, hand crank for turning the
propeller, tiller for operating the rudder,
100 pounds of lead ballast, immersion
chamber for flooding in order to ob-
tain more ballast, two brass pumps for
emptying the immersion chamber, and
two tubes which passed to the surface
for fresh air.
In 1776 the "Turtle" was used in
two attacks against the British fleet. One
of these came against the flagship
"Eagle" in New York harbor, while the
other was carried out at Fort Lee on the
Hudson River. In both of the attacks, the
British ships and the "Turtle" escaped
unharmed.
Robert Fulton is credited for his in-
vention of the steamboat, but few peo-
ple realize he was also a submarine,
torpedo, and mine expert. He took up
where Bushneli left off, and although he
accomplished little more than Bushneli,
he did focus further attention on under-
water warfare.
At the age of twenty-one Fulton left
America and went on a tour of Europe
to further his chances as an artist. Fulton,
however, soon lost his interest in art,
and devoted much of his time to under-
water explosives and submersibles. He
tried to get the French and Dutch govern-
ments interested in a "plunging boat," but
all initial attempts failed. Finally he
gained an audience with Napoleon Bona-
parte and succeeded in getting the money
for the construction of the boat.
The submarine was called the "Nauti-
lus," and was first tried in Brest. In one
of the first tests in the harbor, the
"Nautilus" made a run of 50 yards in
seven minutes. This speed was too slow
to satisfy Napoleon, for he needed

faster crafts in his attacks on the British
men-of-war.
Fulton was not discouraged, and con-
tinued his experimentation. He made
subsequent dives to 25 feet below the
surface and remained there for a period
of one hour. Fulton also placed thick
glass plate on the "Nautilus" in order
to let light into the chamber, and con-
structed a copper container into which
was compressed 200 atmospheres of air.
This increased his submerged time to
one hour and forty minutes. Fulton,
however, soon turned his interests toward
explosives and steam power, a field in
which he has received his greatest
acclaim.
Civil War Submarines
The first man-of-war to be sunk by a
submarine occured during the Civil War.
I twas the Union sloop-of-war "Hous-
tonic," and was sunk by the Confeder-
ate submarine "Hunley" while anchored
in Charleston Harbor in 1864.
The Confederates became interested in
the possibilities of submarine warfare in
1862 when private citizens of the South
built several sub-sea craft. Horace L.
Hunley was the principal figure in this
group of war workers. He built several
of the "Hunley" type craft during the
war.
The "Hunley" was in the shape of a
cylinder, 25 feet long, and 48 inches in
diameter. It was manned by nine men,
eight of them principally for the purpose
of manning the eight hand cranks on the
shaft connected to the propeller. The
ballast tanks were installed, one in each
end. The vessel had a rudder for steer-
ing, two side planes for controlling
depth, and two hatches.
During the period of her many dives,
the "Hunley" sank to the bottom five
times, taking the lives of a total of
35 crew members. Her outstanding
achievement in sinking the "Houstonic"
was not celebrated by the crew on that
voyage either, for she and her crew went
down with the sloop they had destroyed.
During the remainder of the Civil
War only a few more attempts were
made to develop an operational submar-
ine. Several semi-type submarines called
"Davids," were used by the Confederates,
but none of them met with much suc-
cess. The "Intelligent Whale," built by
the Union Navy in 1864, was a step in
the right direction, for it developed a
speed of 4 knots, but even this vessel
was condemned.
Submarines to the World War
John Philip Holland was the next
American inventor to take up the struggle
for the development of the submarine
into a practical war fighting machine.
Between 1870 and 1900 he accomplished
more than any other previous inventor,
American or otherwise.
After having several preliminary plans
rejected by the Navy, Holland developed
a submarine 10 feet long propelled by
an oil engine. The engine was not a
complete success, but it was a forerunner
of modern submarine propulsion.
The next model was called the "Fenian
Ram." It was 30 feet long, 6 feet wide,
and displaced 17 gross tons. It had verti-
cal and horizontal rudders, and a 17
horse-power engine. A bow tube was
provided for ejecting torpedos by air.
This vessel was a complete success and
definitely progressed development of
submarine construction.
Holland then built a huge submarine
by common standards. It was called the
"Plunger" and was launched on August
7, 1897. The "Plunger" was 85 feet
long, 12 feet in diameter, and displaced
168 tons. It had three engines which
developed a total of 1500 H.P. This
vessel did not reach complete success,
and therefore was never accepted by the
Navy.
Holland then built a new submarine
with personal funds, and money which
he raised. This craft called the "Hol-
land," was 53 feet long, 10 feet wide and
displaced 14 tons. It was Holland's own
"brain child," with no outside inter-
ference from the Navy.
While working on his new craft, Hol-
land met a young engineer named Frank
Cable. He liked the way Cable worked
and asked him to join him in building
the "Holland." Cable accepted, and as
time went on, the two men formed an
ideal team, with Holland the inventor
and Cable the "practical" man.
These two men went on to complete
the "Holland," and built several other
highly developed submarines of the same
type as their first craft. These "Holland"
type vessels were accepted by the Navy
and placed into limited production.
Several of these American-built submar-
ines were sold to Russia and Japan.
At about this time in history, the
dark clouds of war were beginning to
form, and every major navy in the
world became interested in submarine
type craft. This interest soon developed
into intense research programs in coun-
tries like Germany, Japan, and America.
The research programs soon paid off, for
when war finally did break, the deadly
ability of submarines in naval warfare
was rather shockingly revealed to the
world. Even though this rise as a naval
weapon was sudden, it is obvious that
the submarine is no new invention. It
has come into being only through the
hard and diligent efforts of many men
like Bushnell, Fulton, Hunley, Holland,
and Cable.

FROM THE SEA
Is the machine age doomed in its infancy by
exhaustion of our mineral resources or will man
be able to extract metals his civilization needs
from the sea? by BRYAN WHIPPLE, '61E
We're running short of minerals.
Nearly every one of us has felt
concern at one time or another over the
fate of our industrial economy, should
(or when) our mines and wells begin
to scrape bottom. Most of us, being
optimists, and more than slightly com-
placent, trust that the ability of science
and technology will overcome these
shortages as they occur. Society demands
more goods, the wheels of industry
keep clanking, and authors write of the
fabulous world which is to be our to-
morrow. Like a giant tabby cat that has
finished her saucer of milk, industry
closes her jaws, to purr, and rub her
sleek fur against the leg of that benign
uncle, science and beg for more.
Realize Futility
Practicing scientists and engineers are
liable to take a dim view of this. Real-
izing the futility of trying to make some-
thing from nothing, they are not so
confident of their imputed ability for
developing adequate substitutes. How-
ever, they are also optimists. They are at
the fore in fashioning plans for the
future. They do not bear in levity their
quasi-status as seemingly omnipotent
benefactors of the species. Already sci-
ence has begun to cast about for new
sources of old materials, to assay yet
untapped storehouses. The greatest of
these now barely-scratched sources is the
sea.
The sea, mother and erstwhile nourish-
er of all life, may soon be revisited by
her most precocious child, man. The
earth can no longer feed his multitudes
so he proposes to make a garden of the
sea. The soil can no longer give up
metals for his mills and furnaces. The
sea will become his mine.
Sea water is a remarkable substance.
It is heavier than pure water, 64 Ib/cu ft.
compared to 62.4. This additional weight
is added by the treasure that is entrapped
in this remarkable solution, for sea
water is much more than hydogen and
oxygen. It is more than water and salt.
Sea water has been carefully analysed,
then artificially recreated in the labora-
tory. This "sea water" will not support
even the simplest forms of sea life;
however, the addition of even so slight
an amount of natural sea water makes it
completely habitable. So, there are yet
undiscovered mysteries surrounding this
well-known solution. Enough is known
of its composition, however, to provide
plenty of encouragement to the nautical
prospector.
Three Main Classes
There are three main classes of solutes
in sea water which are of interest to
those planning to tap its potential. The
first class includes the fases which are
in solution, or, the radicals whose pres-
ence in sea water depends on an equil-
ibrium with some atmospheric constitu-
ent.
Oxygen and carbon dioxide are always
found in sea water. Their presence is
required for the sustenance of plant and
animal life. Although oxygen is less
soluable in sea water than in fresh
water, as much as 8 cc/L will be ab-
sorbed at 0°C. Nitrogen, accounting for
78 percent of atmospheric gas, consti-
tutes only 64 percent of the dissolved
gases in the sea. This elemental nitrogen
is of no significance biologically unless

Bryan Whipple, a sophomore in
Industrial Engineering, has a keen
interest in highly technical subjects
as this article indicates.
A graduate of Cooley High
School in Detroit, Bryan's inter-
ests include radio, railroading,
camping, philosophy, and the fu-
ture of Alaska. While in high
school Bryan participated in news-
paper, Hi-Y, yearbook, radio club,
and conservation club.

converted to nitrates or ammonium salts
by bacteria. Carbon dioxide is present
in sea water at up to fifty times its
atmospheric concentration, but still ac-
counts for only 1.6 percent of the gases
dissolved in the sea (compared with
0.03 percent of the air). The sea is
considered a reservoir of CCX which the
atmosphere may draw from or add to as
the seasons, and thus, the needs of plants,
change. The carbon dioxide in the sea
is present in a number of forms: as COj
in true solution; as undissociated car-
bonic acid; as dissociated carbonic acid;
HCOa; as carbonates and as bicarbon-
ates. These carbonates and bicarbonates
exist because sea water is slightly basic
due to the predominance of basic metals
—calcium, sodium, magnesium—which
brings us to the second class of solutes.
Famous for Salts
Sea water is famous for its constituent
salts; indeed, saltiness is the trademark
of the sea. Sodium chloride is the best-
known and most abundant of these, con-
stituting 77.7 percent of the salt content
of the sea, at a concentration of over 27
parts per 1,000 of evaporated sea water.
Next in order of abundance are mag-
nesium chloride (10.8%, 3.8 p.p. thous-
and) and magnesium sulphate (4.7%,
over 1.6 p.p. thousand), both sources of
much of the light metal used in airframe
construction. Calcium sulphate follows,
at 1.26 parts per million, and the list is
completed by potassium sulphate, cal-
cium carbonate, and magnesium bro-
mide. While these are not the only salts
found in the sea, they are by far the
most abundant, and present the best pos-
sibilities for recovery. Altogether, about
50 elements have been detected in sea
water, or in the tissues of sea animals.
In the open sea salinity does not vary
greatly, remaining near 35 p.p. thous-
and total concentration of all salts. In
certain regions, as at the eastern end of
the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, the
figure rises to 42, and in inland seas,
such as the Dead Sea, to 200 p.p.
thousand.
The third class of substances in sea
water is dissolved organic matter. August
Krough estimated that the dissolved
organic substance of the sea was equal
to 20,000 times the world's wheat harvest
for one year. This matter is largely the
residue from sea life: the wastes of their
bodies, and the dissolved bodies them-
selves. The chemical composition of these
residues is necessarily various and com-
plex.
Wholly aside from its dissolved con-
tent of minerals, gases, and organic
matter, the sea is a storehouse in an-
other way. At the bottom of the sea
are mountains, valleys, and whole con-
tinents, hiding undiscovered seams of
(probably) any mineral known in dry
land. Already geologists have discovered
methods of recovering oil from the sedi-
mentary rocks underlying such shallow
seas as the Gulf of Mexico. Such seas
show promise of yielding oil at even
greater depths than can presently be
worked. Ancient tin mines in England
have shafts extending out to sea for some
distance; workers alledgedly could hear
the pounding of waves on stormy days.
Frasch process sulphur wells have
waded out into shallow water. Perhaps
one day the miner will be able to work
beneath the floor of even an open sea.
Greatest Promise
The sea's greatest promise, however,
lies in the hydrosphere itself. A single
cubic mile of sea water contains 166
million tons of salts; the entire sea holds
about 5xl013 tons. The discharge of the
faintly salty rivers of the earth adds
several billion tons of salt each year.
Volcanoes on the sea floor discharge
huge quantities of rock, ash, and chem-
ical gases into the water where they are
dissolved.
Historically, the removal of minerals
from sea water began with the Chinese,
who tapped salt wells more than two
thousand years ago. This brine was, and
is, pumped from seas trapped under the
continent to the surface, three thousand
feet up, in bamboo pipes, and conveyed
to vats where the water is evaporated by
sunlight.
More recently, the noted German
chemist, Fritz Haber, became intrigued
by the possibility of extracting gold from
sea water. Even at the enormous dilu-
tion of two parts per billion, there are
eleven tons of dissolved gold in a cubic
mile of sea. As there are more than
three hundred million cubic miles of
water in the sea, her hoard of gold could
make every person on the globe a million-
aire. Haber planned to extract enough

Well, how did you do last month?
What! Not too well? You think you
could do better with more of the same?
All right, here are a few similar to last
month's:
1. The lettering on the glass door of
a barber shop reads correctly when seen
from the street. How does this lettering
appear when seen in a mirror in the shop,
which reflects it from another mirror?
STOP! Don't turn that page to look
at the answer yet. Here is another little
teaser concerning a mirror.
2. If you saw your mirrored image
holding a small printed letter "b" in
your right hand with the letter facing
you, what would you actually be doing
on your side of the mirror at the same
time?

Last month, I asked you to find the
largest number that could be expressed
in three integers. This month, we shall
go from the one extreme to the other.
What is the smallest number, greater
than zero, that can be expressed using
three integers?
Can you draw a triangle? This sounds
almost too simple. Well, if it is, you
can get it right and make yourself feel
good. So try it anyway.
The points A, B, and C are each in
the middle of one of the sides of the
triangle to be drawn.
Also, what is the size relationship of
this triangle as compared to the triangle
ABC, if the points indicated were con-
nected.
This little trick would be good to
know, but don't try it in church.

appreciated by a number of our students:

Vought offers this range
to the young engineer
At Chance Vought the engineer's assign-
ments range from the depths of the ocean to
the farthest reaches of space . .. from hard-
ware operating aboard the Navy's nuclear-
armed submarines to space research vehicles
still on the boards.
Here the engineer contributes to projects
such as the record-smashing Crusader jet
fighter series . .. the Regulus missiles .. .
and advanced weapons, details of which are
still classified.
Under the guidance of the Vought engi-
neer, such weapons take shape. He super-
vises critical tests, and he introduces the
weapons to the men with whom they
will serve.
Engineers with many specialties share these
experiences. Today, for example, Vought is
at work on important projects involving:
SPACECRAFT AND ASTRONAUTICS
ADVANCED PROPULSION METHODS
ELECTRONICS DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE
ANTISUBMARINE WARFARE
Vought's excellent R&amp;D facilities help the
engineer through unexplored areas. And by
teaming up with other specialists against
mutual challenges, the Vought engineer
learns new fields while advancing in his cwn.

to young engineers at Vought
Here, your "feel" for space will come quickly. Vought's
core of seasoned space specialists is introducing the
new medium to a widening circle of colleagues. The
goal is space indoctrination for all engineers — a space
capability comparable to Vought's current stature in
missiles and aircraft.
With experience, the young engineer will join
Vought projects under way this minute: space research
vehicles; cockpits and crew quarters for space; devices
for escape from orbit; nuclear and ionic propulsion.
In astronautics, as in Crusader III fighter and
Regulus II missile development, the Vought engineer's
view will be broad. He will conceive, develop, design
and test complete products. This is an advantage found
only in a company that holds both weapon system
management and detail design responsibility.

buoys and more of them; economy is
a distinct advantage of the buoys, since
they rarely can be recovered. An aircraft
can cover a large number of them scat-
tered over a wide area at costs small
compared to ship's time.
A recent study of interest to those
who work in search and rescue at sea,
and particularly to those concerned with
landing large seaplanes in the open
ocean, is the study of waves from the air.
Oceanographers from Woods Hole have
utilized two aircraft in taking two simul-
taneous stereogrammetricly contoured
photographs, providing an accurate three
dimensional picture of the sea's surface.
Geological Research
Geologists are interested in the ocean
floor primarily because it represents the
largest part of the unexplored world,
and the bottom sediment contains a
"recorded" history of several million
years. New methods of exploration are
making previously inaccessable bedrock
(Continued from page 13)
structures available for study, and have
consequently caused many of the older
theories of the earth's history to be
revised.
The marine geologist and the geo-
physicist realize that the greater part of
our earth is hidden by water and may
provide a clue to the history of our
planet. Of practical importance also is
the study of marine sediments in an
attempt to learn how petroleum was
formed.
To plot the topography of the ocean
floor echo sounders are used with a
system developed at Woods Hole. The
recorders used by the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution, known spe-
cifically as versatile precision high reso-
lution echo-sounding recording systems,
are accurate to one part in 30,000, i.e.,
at a depth of 30,000 feet, readings are
accurate to within one foot.
A newer system developed at Woods
Hole uses a "spark" as a sound source
with a broad spectrum, so that sound
reflected from the bottom and rock lay-
ers below the sediment can be filtered
to develop and emphasize sub-bottom
reflections. This instrument has already
been used for engineering studies in de-
termining the depth to bedrock in bays,
in estimating the cost of channel deepen-
ing, or in the erection of sub-surface
structures.
Approximately one-sixth of the na-
tional budget to oceanography for the
International Geophysical Year went to
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.
This money has been used in conjunc-
tion with programs of several universi-
ties and other oceanographic organiza-
tions to study deep currents and the
carbon dioxide content of the sea and
atmosphere, and to send expeditions to
the Indian Ocean and the Arctic Ocean.
If the results from these and past pro-
jects are representative of results of
future projects, we may yet realize the
full potential of the seas surrounding us.
START TODAY TO
PLAN TOMORROW
By knowing about some of the projects underway at the
Babcock &amp; Wilcox Company, an engineer may see his
personal avenues of growth and advancement. For today
B&amp;W stands poised at a new era of expansion and
development.
Here's an indication of what's going on at B&amp;W, with
the consequent opportunities that are opening up for
engineers. The Boiler Division is building the world's
largest steam generator. The Tubular Products Division
recently introduced extruded seamless titanium tubing,
one result of its metallurgical research. The Refractories
Division developed the first refractory concrete that will
withstand temperatures up to 3200 F. The Atomic Energy
Division is under contract by the AEC to design and
build the propulsion unit of the world's first nuclear-
powered cargo vessel.
These are but a few of the projects — not in the plan-
ning stage, but in the actual design and manufacturing
phases — upon which B&amp;W engineers are now engaged.
The continuing, integrated growth of the company offers
engineers an assured future of leadership.
How is the company doing right now? Let's look at one
line from the Annual Stockholders' Report.

which provided for utmost dependability in everything
mechanical. To assure complete dependability in the con-

Jenkins Valves were chosen.
Because of such confidence, "JENKINS" has been the

Two stellerators have been built at
Princeton University (See the schematic
diagram), and a third improved model is
under construction. It has a torus of a
figure eight shape surrounded by helical
field coils. The unusual shape of the
torus cuts down one undesirable type of

MINIATURIZATION for the MISSILE AGE
Another new design frontier for copper
"The increasing amount of equip-
ment carried on military aircraft
. . . has made it necessary for the
design engineer to cram more equip-
ment into less space."
"To achieve maximum usefulness
from miniaturization, all elements
of the system must be reduced to the
same order of size. New design tech-
niques, components and production
methods have been developed to aid
the designer in reaching this goal."
— Electronics Magazine
Many of these new design tech-
niques are taking advantage of the
properties of a very old material —
copper. One of copper's big jobs is
conducting electricity in control cir-
cuits. Of course, copper is the best
commercial conductor, but when
miniaturization takes over, many
other properties of copper also be-
come important.

Printed circuit of copper bonded to
epoxy glass base, and sheet of the ad-
hesive-backed copper used in its manu-
facture by Rubber &amp; Asbestos Corp.
In the printed circuits
that are the very basis of
most subminiature de-
signs, the conductors may
start out as a sheet of
copper foil. This foil often
has to be very thin — yet
free of flaws that might
cause circuit discontinui-
ties. Here, copper's ductil-
ity is vital.
Good joining properties
are also important. Some
of the tiny connections are
resistance welded. (Cop-
per can withstand the
temperatures.) Others are
soldered. (Easily done
with copper and with very
little solder metal.)
Complex control cir-
cuits can now be wired
with flexible Tape Cable.
This tape may contain as
many as 50 copper con-
ductors, side by side —
and weigh only 2 V2
pounds per 100-ft. roll.
The standard size of each of the
rectangular conductors in the tape
is 0.0015 in. by 0.03 in.
Obviously, with such small cross
sections, no deterioration of the con-
ductor is permissible. Yet tempera-
tures, particularly in missile appli-
cations, are high. The answer is
found in copper which is free of
oxygen—eliminating oxidation, scale
formation and conductivity losses.
In other high temperature appli-
cations, copper's high thermal con-
ductivity can be used to protect more
delicate parts from excessive heat.
For this reason it is useful in missile

nose cones. And, of course, copper's
excellent corrosion resistance is
often valuable in exposed parts and
in tubing.
The field of missiles and rocketry
is but another example of a design
frontier where the versatility of cop-
per and the copper alloys helps make
progress possible.

may join is the Society of Naval Archi-
tects and Marine Engineers (S.N.A.M.E.)
Each year the S.N.A.M.E. offers one
undergraduate scholarship worth $1,000
per year for four years to a student at
the University of Michigan. It also offers
three graduate scholarships worth $1,600
plus tuition for one year of graduate
study at any school in the United States
or abroad. Another source of scholar-
ships is the National Association of En-
gine and Boat Manufacturers which nor-
maly gives two, 2 year scholarships worth
$750 each to students at the University
of Michigan.
Co-Op Programs
Quite a few of the students are work-
ing on the co-operative plan with vari-
ous shipyards. Boston Naval Shipyard
and New York Naval Shipyard both have
a five year co-operative program. The
students in this program work at the
shipyard during the summer after grad-
uation from high school. He then goes
to school full time during his freshman
year, then alternates work and study
periods during the rest of his college
years until his senior year when he at-
tends school full time. During the fresh-
man and senior years, transportation,
tuition, books and equipment are paid
for. Not only are there students on the
co-op plan here, but there are several
students who have been sent here by the
companies which they work for. One of
the biggest shipyards in the United States
now has eight students taking courses
here.
Opportunities in Naval Architecture
and Marine Engineering are excellent.
For example, there were sixteen people
graduated in June of 1956. Due to vari-
ous reasons only seven were available for
employment, and there were an astound-
ing 140 offers of employment for one or
all of them! That hasn't quite been
duplicated in the subsequent two years,
but the demand is still very high. The
recession in the oil business has cut down
the demand sliehtly, but there are still
many jobs which lack people to fill them.
Shipbuilding, one of the oldest trades
in the world, is still going strong today.
In fact it is growing, and demanding
the talents of more skilled specialists
every year. The University of Michigan
has one of the largest and finest depart-
ments in the world, but even it cannot
meet the demand for naval architects and
marine engineers.

of the yellow metal to pay the German
debt of the First World War. His float-
ing laboratory on the Meteor made nu-
merous Atlantic crossings between 1924
and 1928, sampling the water. No eco-
nomical means of extraction was found,
however, although the value of gold
and silver in each cubic mile exceeded
$100,000,000. Indeed, a fellow named
Blackmore spent five thousand dollars to
extract five dollars' worth of gold and
silver from the sea.
Germans Pioneer Field
Since then men have met with greater
success in mining the sea. The Germans
again pioneered the field operating pilot
plants for the extraction of magnesium
salts from the sea before World War II.
Since June, 1942, Velasco Defense Plant
Corporation and Dow Chemical Com-
pany have operated a sea mine at Free-
port, Texas, on the Gulf Coast. Velasco's
operation yields 36,000 tons of the light
metal in a year by the following process.
Oyster shells, largely calcium carbo-

mixed with sea water causes the pre-
cipitation of a sludge, largely magnesium
hydroxide.
CaCO:i -* CaO + CO,
CaO + MgCl2 + H..O
-» Mg(OH), 1 + CaCl,
After being decanted, the hydroxide
is converted back to the chloride with
hydrochloric acid. This is dried, fused,
and subjected to electrolysis, yielding
metallic magnesium, which is dipped
from the surface of the electrolytic cell,
and chlorine, which is recovered for re-
use as hydrochloric acid.
Ninety-nine percent of the world's
bromine is concentrated in the sea, prin-
cipally as magnesium bromide (after
evaporation). Thanks to the ease with
which it can be removed, bromide is
available for gasoline additives, photog-
raphy, and lachrymators such as tear gas.
There is hope of economical recovery
of even the trace elements in the sea.
Certain forms of sea life—animals and
plants—concentrate specific elements and
compounds in their bodies. Fiant kelp
have long been harvested and dried for
their content of potassium carbonate.
Oyster shells have such a high concen-
tration of calcium carbonate that they are
ground and burned directly for lime.
Lobsters and crabs concentrate enough
copper to color their blood blue. Mol-
lusks are nickel-rich; vanadrium is found
in certain sea-slugs. Other lower forms
of sea life concentrate lead and arsenic.
It is not altogether impossible that these
organisms could be profitably put to
work.
There can be little doubt that the sea
contains enough minerals to sustain man
for a long, long time. Technology has
only to learn how to extract the more
dilute ones, and find new uses for the
common ones, such as magnesium. Man's
dream of a better tomorrow seems a
little more secure thanks to the reservoir
of nourishment and materials that are in
the sea.

Chemical industry is expanding at a tremendous rate, providing opportunities for
chemical engineers in research on new products, in development of cheaper processes,
in the design of new plants, in operation of plants or in sales. The broad scientific edu-
cation received in the chemical engineering curriculum equips the graduate to enter
many new fields outside the chemical industry. Traditionally, chemical engineering has
led the enginering fields in proportion of students who seek advanced training by grad-
uate study.
Thermodynamics is a basic engineering science. Measurements of the thermo-
dynamic properties of substances are an important area of research. The console shown

NOT literally, of course, but they are
engaged in so many electronic activ-

world above us that they might well
be broadly identified as "space men."
Many have achieved a high record
of success in research, design, pro-

Vortac, Data Link, VOR, DME, Nava-
screen, Navarho, and automatic
"typewriters" serving the Narcast sys-
tem for in-flight weather reporting.
Other ITT "space men" are mak-
ing important contributions to air
reconnaissance, inertial navigation,
infrared, missile guidance and con-
trol, electronic countermeasures, ra-
dio communications, radar, scatter

ries vital to national defense.
These are only a few of the many

Materials and lubricants used in bearings
today are inadequate for certain foreseeable
needs. To help find answers to such vital
problems, engineers at The Fafnir Bearing
Company are provided with the most up-
to-date facilities for ball bearing research
and development, including a completely
modernized metallurgical laboratory, and
highly refined devices for testing bearings,
bearing materials, components, and lubri-

Industry's demand for capable graduates in the fields of science and
engineering is still exceeding the supply produced by American colleges
and universities. As a result, the most promising members of this year's
class may well wind up with a number of openings to consider.
In such circumstances, who would blame a bright young man for at
least letting the phrase "eeny, meeny, miny, mo" slip through his mind!
Of course, there is one inescapable conclusion to be considered: open-
ings are one thing, genuine opportunities quite another. Thoughtful
examination of such factors as potential growth, challenge, advance-
ment policy, facilities, degree of self-direction, permanence, and
benefits often indicates that real opportunity does not yet grow
on trees.
Moreover, the great majority of personal success stories are
still being written by those who win positions with the
most successful companies.

feared weapons in modern warfare. Con-
ventional submarines were a menace to
surface shipping, but atomic submarines,
with great depth, great speed, and ex-
tended range are a mence to land bases
and cities anywhere in the world.
As soon as any new weapon is de-
veloped, right behind it comes the means
for combatting it; one never knows if
and when the enemy will also discover
the weapon. As yet, US intelligence has
no evidence that Russia has the nuclear
submarine. However, anything possible
for the US is possible for Russia. We
do know that Russia has the largest sub-
marine force the world has ever seen,
500 boats to the US 110. Over half
of the Rusian boats are capable of carry-
ing and firing missiles. Any day, the
Russians may build their first nuclear
submarine; therefore, the ASW (Anti-
submarine Warfare) activities have top
priority nowadays, and more than one
expert has said that it seems impossible
to stop the atomic submarine. It be-
comes more and more imperative that

sir."
"What the devil are you doing 20 de-
grees off course?" asked the officer.
Up came the answer from the young
seaman on helm duty: "Coming back

Other Problems
Speed, depth, and range are not the
only problems which make ASW work
difficult; the ocean itself is a problem.
Sonar seems to be the most effective
means we have at present for detecting
submarines. However, the ocean is filled
with marine fauna which hiss, crackle,
groan and squeak. Sonar has a difficult
time distinguishing an enemy submarine
fr6m the background of noise of a school
of shrimp. As subs go faster, the sound
of water rushing by the hull becomes a
real problem. Some parts of our eastern
coast have an abundance of sunken ships
which echo a ping' exactly like that of
a submarine. An enemy sub could hide
close to our large eastern cities among
the derelicts and be virtually undetect-
able until it was too late.

There we sat, 60 of us crowded to-

No. 33 in a Kodak Series

The Army's first operational rotor-tip
propelled jet helicopter—built by Hiller.
The camera has caught the fuel spray
pattern within the rear end of the ram-
jet engine even though passing by at
about 450 miles per hour.

Project:
Inspect rotor tip jets for a whirlybird
Hiller Helicopters wanted facts on the fuel spray pattern of a ram-jet engine
whirling at speeds up to 700 feet per second. Photography got the job.
WHEN HILLER HELICOPTERS of Palo AltO, Cal.
—a pioneer in vertical take-off aircraft—
developed a rotor-tip ram-jet engine, they knew
the fuel spray would be subject to high air velocity
and centrifugal force up to 1200 G's. Would the
fuel spray be deflected outward and cause the
jet to lose thrust? They wanted to know. So they
set up the camera with its fast eye to catch what
otherwise couldn't be seen. And they learned the
right angle of air intake and nozzle to obtain the
greatest power.
Using photography in research is an old story
with Hiller—just as familiar as using it for
improving public relations. It's an example of
the way photography plays many important roles
in modern-day industry.
In whatever work you do you will find that
photography will play a part in improving prod-
ucts, aiding quality control and increasing sales.

One of a series'
Interview with General Electric's
W. Scott Hill
Manager — Engineering Recruiting
Qualities I Look For
When Recruiting Engineers
Q. Mr. Hill, what can I do to get the
most out of my job interviews?
A. You know, we have the same
question. I would recommend that
you have some information on what
the company does and why you be-
lieve you have a contribution to
make. Looking over company in-
formation in your placement office
is helpful. Have in mind some of the
things you would like to ask and try
to anticipate questions that may
refer to your specific interests.
Q. What information do you try to get
during your interviews?
A. This is where we must fill in be-
tween the lines of the personnel
forms. I try to find out why partic-
ular study programs have been fol-
lowed, in order to learn basic motiva-
tions. I also try to find particular
abilities in fields of science, or math-
ematics, or alternatively in the more
practical courses, since these might
not be apparent from personnel rec-
ords. Throughout the interview we
try to judge clarity of thinking since
this also gives us some indication of
ability and ultimate progress. One
good way to judge a person, I find,
is to ask myself: Would he be easy
to work with and would I like to
have him as my close associate?
Q. What part do first impressions play
in your evaluation of people?
A. I think we all form a first im-
pression when we meet anyone.
Therefore, if a generally neat ap-
pearance is presented, I think it
helps. It would indicate that you
considered this important to your-
self and had some pride in the way
the interviewer might size you up.
Q. With only academic training as a
background, how long will it be before
I'll be handling responsible work?
A. Not long at all. If a man joins a
training program, or is placed direct-
ly on an operating job, he gets
assignments which let him work up
to more responsible jobs. We are
hiring people with definite consider-
ation for their potential in either
technical work or the management
field, but their initial jobs will be
important and responsible.
Q. How will the fact that I've had to
work hard in my engineering studies,
with no time for a lot of outside activi-
ties, affect my employment possibilities?
A. You're concerned, I'd guess, with
all the talk of the quest for "well-
rounded men." We do look for this
characteristic, but being president
of the student council isn't the only
indication of this trait. Through
talking with your professors, for
example, we can determine who
takes the active role in group proj-
ects and gets along well with other
students in the class. This can be
equally important in our judgment.
Q. How important are high scholastic
grades in your decision to hire a man?
A. At G.E. we must have men who
are technically competent. Your
grades give us a pretty good indica-
tion of this and are also a measure
of the way you have applied your-
self. When we find someone whose
grades are lower than might be ex-
pected from his other characteristics,
we look into it to find out if there
are circumstances which may have
contributed.
Q. What consideration do you give work
experience gained prior to graduation?
A. Often a man with summer work
experience in his chosen academic
field has a much better idea of what
he wants to do. This helps us decide
where he would be most likely to
succeed or where he should start his
career. Many students have had to
work hard during college or sum-
mers, to support themselves. These
men obviously have a motivating
desire to become engineers that we
find highly desirable.
Q. Do you feel that a man must know
exactly what he wants to do when he is
being interviewed?
A. No, I don't. It is helpful if he
has thought enough about his in-
terests to be able to discuss some
general directions he is considering.
For example, he might know whether
he wants product engineering work,
or the marketing of technical prod-
ucts, or the engineering associated
with manufacturing. On G-E train-
ing programs, rotating assignments
are designed to help men find out
more about their true interests be-
fore they make their final choice.
Q. How do military commitments affect
your recruiting?
A. Many young men today have
military commitments when they
graduate. We feel it is to their ad-
vantage and ours to accept employ-
ment after graduation and then ful-
fill their obligations. We have a
limited number of copies of a De-
partment of Defense booklet de-
scribing, in detail, the many ways in
which the latter can be done. Just

a million ideas
JANUARY, 1959


Since February first is the date that the Technic changes
hands, this editor feels obligated to summarize the more
important shortcomings and achievements of the sphere
in which our readers live. These are the topics to which
we haven't been able to devote full editorial space in the
past year.
In the Engineering College, we find that much less has
been heard from across campus regarding the old technical-
vs-liberal education argument since October of 1957. (You
may recall that the first Soviet satellite was launched that
month). Perhaps some of us have realized that (even as
highly desirable as liberal and nontechnical subjects are)
learning science and engineering is a full-time four-year
business. The completion of the Fluids Building on North
Campus is just another accomplishment in a long and suc-
cessful history of growth for the College; every building
there is a tribute to the vision and energy of the men who
fostered the idea; men of the caliber of George Granger
Brown, the late Dean of the College. The day should not
be far off when the Science Institute will be founded; this
will be another positive step in the direction of greater
stature (if the State Government can see its way clear to
resume support of its Universities).
In regard to the Michigan State Government, a situa-
tion like the present one in Lansing is certainly deplorable.
It is unusual, to say the least, to have an administration so
one-sided as to have corporation taxes among the highest
in the country (the Technic, May, 1958); an atmosphere
in the state extremely favorable to labor, and conversely
unfavorable to prospective industry; welfare payments to
the unemployed so high that the state faces a 100-million
dollar deficit by June and that unemployment is fostered,
so that our state has one of the most severe chronic unem-
ployment problems in the country; this situation will not
change until the outlook of the state administration is re-
vised to a more realistic one. It will apparently take a state
income tax to get Lansing out of the jam it has gotten
itself into.
In the U.S., race and space are the subjects of interest.
The integration struggle will require great efforts before
its end, still a long way off, will be reached. And the
Southerners have a sharp point when they ask us from the
North to clean up our own back yard first—restricted real
estate policy, one of the most widespread un-American
practices in the nation today, will be with us for a long
time to come, unfortunately. One basic answer to these
problems is an old one—an appreciation of the other's
point of view. This philosophy would give extreme benefit
to many Americans when they try to rationalize the behav-
ior of others. In fact, while discussing the American
citizen, it would do well to point out a Gallup survey of
1951, which asked six questions: Who was Chiang Kai
Chek? What is the 38th parallel? Where is Manchuria?
Where is Formosa? Who is Marshall Tito? What is the
Marshall Plan? Only twelve per cent of the adults ques-
tioned could answer all six—worse yet, nineteen per cent
were unable to answer even one! These are people who
have radios and newspapers, too—perhaps we need to pay
a little attention to what we read and hear. It would
certainly be easier to appreciate the other point of view if
we knew enough about the situation to figure out what is
the other point of view.
Both nationally and internationally, space immediately
surrounds us. Especially as engineers, we are now the
front-line troops of the cold war. The astronautical con-
flict between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. revives an old con-
flict of ideas we first became aware of during World War
II, when discussing the relative merits of the Japanese
Zero and our Navy fighter planes; the same question
was rekindled over Korean skies in 1950. Were armor,
flotation tanks, and other safety devices necessary on air-
craft? Why not replace them with fuel, firepower, and
maneuverability? The continued successes of American
aircraft bear out our conviction on this subject. The people
of our nation should be reminded of the same facts when
told of glittering Soviet successes, in order to present a
true picture, even if pessimistic. For example: an "ICBM"
test by the Soviets a couple of years ago was in reality an
unsuccessful attempt to put up a satellite; the result was
the elimination of about twenty peasants in a Siberian
village. After all, why use safety devices? They waste
payload weight, and payloads are wonderful for propa-
ganda. The American people should at least be aware of
these facts when reading or hearing news (not to men-
tion other Soviet failures clouded in secrecy).
It would be in order to offer my thanks to an admir-
able staff of efficient people, who, by straining hard when-
ever it was needed most, managed to turn out eight issues
of the Technic. For an organization like ours is nothing
more than the sum of a group of hard-working students,
trying to sandwich in some extra work between studying
texts, studying coeds, and studying alcohol. What do we
get out of it, besides experience, companionship, and the
jokes that Davidson continually comes up with? I don't
know but we have a good time at it anyway.
—M.A.W.

Samuel Zimmerman joined Westinghouse in 1955
- now developing missile guidance system
At 27, Samuel E. Zimmerman, a 1955 BSEE graduate
of the University of North Dakota, is already well on
his way in an exciting career in defense electronics.
Now at work in the Electronics Division in Baltimore
on the ground guidance and control system for the
advanced BOMARC missile, he's principally concerned
with the development of special purpose computers
and helped to design the error detection and logic sys-
tems for a new transistorized computer-tracker.
Most important, Samuel Zimmerman is doing exactly
what he wants to be doing. Since completion of the West-
inghouse Student Training Course, he has submitted
four patent disclosures, one of which resulted in a
cash award; and he's now preparing two more. In addi-
tion, he has completed a year of graduate work on wave
theory and analog computers toward a Master of
Science degree at the University of Maryland under
the Westinghouse Graduate Study Program.
Samuel Zimmerman is one of many talented young
engineers who are finding rewarding careers with
Westinghouse. You can, too, if you've got ambition
and you're a man of exceptional ability. Our broad
product line and decentralized operations provide a
diversity of challenging opportunities for talented
engineers. Guided missile controls, atomic power, auto-
mation, radar, semiconductors, and large power equip-
ment are only a few of the fascinating career fields to
be found at Westinghouse.
Why not find out now about the opportunities for
you at Westinghouse? Write to Mr. L. H. Noggle, West-

How to "see" without looking
At a final inspection station how would you
make sure that enclosed parts were properly
lubricated? Until recently, if you really wanted
to know, you had to remove the housing, dis-
assemble the mechanism—a costly, time-
consuming process—and take a look.
But now Standard Oil research has solved
the problem with a new instrument system
that does away with disassembly. It passes

make men-
it is men who make
organizations"
CRAWFORD H. GREENEWALT, PRESIDENT
E. I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS 4. CO. (INC.)


"It is what men bring with them in the way of
character and adaptability and fresh ideas that
enriches the organizational bloodstream and
insures corporate longevity." This is the ob-
servation of Crawford II. Grcenevvalt, President
of the Du Pont Company.
In a lecture given in the past year at Columbia
University. Mr. Grccnewalt outlined his views
on the role of the individual in the organization.
"The DuPont Company's success over the last
150 years," he pointed out, "has come about in
large part through devoted allegiance to two
major themes . . .
"First, the realization that an enterprise will suc-
ceed only to the extent that all individuals as-
sociated with it can be encouraged to exercise
their highest talents in their own particular way.
"Second, the provision of maximum incentives
for achievement, particularly in associating
the fortunes of the individual to that of the
corporation.
"Men are not interchangeable parts, like pinion
gears or carburetors. Individuals differ in ap-
proach and method, and, to perform to best
advantage, they must never be fettered to ap-
proaches and methods not their own."
"Conformity" obviously takes a back seat here.
As Mr. Greencwalt comments, "We conform as
is necessary to good manners, good relationships
and the highest use of individual talent. And
bear in mind that these are strictures on be-
havior, not on creative thought."

TRACKING SATELLITES
With more satellites going up every month, a
number of U. of M. students are performing a
valuable tracking service from the Northern-
most tracking station in the U. S.
Watch that foot! Workmen are
here seen laying the rails which
will connect the new Lincoln plant
in Wixom, Michigan, with the ur-
ban world. This company exempli-
fies the trend toward decentrali-
zation which is now sweeping large
industries. (See story on page 20).

Agroup of University of Michigan
students is providing valuable in-
formation on the United States' arti-
ficial earth satellites from the northern-
most tracking station in the country.
The station was built and is being
operated at Peach Mountain, the site of
the University's radio telescope. The
tracking station was designed mainly for
tracking the Vanguard satellites and pro-
viding information on their orbits.
Basic Design Simple
The University's group, composed
mainly of Aeronautical and Electrical
Engineering students, uses a type of
receiver system called an inferometer,
which utilizes two antennae. The 85 by
18 feet antenna grids, which are spaced
500 feet apart, are constructed of ordin-
ary chicken wire nailed to a wooden
frame which was constructed with an
error of less than 3/100 foot. Eight
T-shaped dipole antennae are evenly
spaced along the grid. The purpose of
the grid is to reflect the weak signals
from the satellite up to the dipole an-
tennae, which are one-half the wave-
by PETE HAMMERTON, '62E
length above the grid. The dipoles are
ordinary cast iron pipes with a capacitor
in them. From the capacitors the weak
signals move along equal lengths of
shielded wire to a junction box where
the signals are combined and put on an
open-wire transmission line. This line is
two thin wires kept a constant distance
apart by plastic spacers every thirty
inches. Although it loses more of the sig-
nal than a shielded cable would, it has
the advantage of being much less expen-
sive. From the junction box the signal
goes to an insulated box, equidistant
from either antenna, containing pre-
amplifiers, signal step-down equipment,
and phasers. The temperature in the box
is kept constant by thermostatically con-
trolled light bulbs acting as heaters.
From this equipment, which steps the
signal down from 108.030 mc to 11.265
mc, a shielded cable carries the two
signals in to U.S. Navy receivers. These
are $2,000 receivers lent to the group by
the Navy for tracking the satellites. The
signal from each grid is sent through a
separate receiver and then into D.C. con-
verters. These provide the impulses that
activate the recording pens as the graph

paper travels past them. In this way, a
separate graph is made for the signal
from each antenna grid showing the
intensity on the signal from the satellite.
By making a third record on the paper,
that of WWV, the Bureau of Standards'
official time signal, the exact moment
when the satellite is in a plane per-
pendicular to the station can be deter-
mined.
Since the group's receivers are at 42°N.
Long., and the satellite's maximum in-
clination to the Equator is 341/2°. prob-
lems not encurred at other tracking sites
appeared. The usual Minitrack station
layout has an East-West antenna line
and a North-South line also. This en-
ables the station to get both longitudinal
and latitudinal bearings on the satellite.
The Michigan station, however, would
have to have such a long North-South
leg to get decent accuracy that it is
obviously impractical. Furthermore, since
the satellite is never directly overhead,
the East-West antenna leg is inclined
22!/2° to the South. This angle was
chosen to get good reception from the
satellite, eliminate ground noise as much
as possible, and to utilize standard pipe
fittings.
Method of Calibration
If the system was built accurately, the
peak of the graph would tell the ob-
servers exactly when the satellite passes
the latitude of the station. Since construc-
tion errors do occur, the system must be
calibrated to get it accurate. This can
be done in various ways. The sun's or
moon's position relative to the Earth at
any given time is very accurately known.
The station to be calibrated can record a
pass of the sun or moon and record a
time signal on the graph. The graph will
show the target passed over the station'5
latitude at a certain time, and the
known facts will show where the target
was at that given time. F:om these facts
the error of the system can be accurately
determined.
Another excellent method of calibrat-
ing the system is to have an airplane fly
over the station at a high altitude and
along a known latitudinal bearing. The
airplane would transmit radio signals
and have a bright flashing light. By
taking a photographic record of the light
and a graphical record of the radio trans-

missions with a time signal recorded on
both, the difference between the visual
bearing and the radio bearing would be
the error of the system. Done correctly,
the system should be calibrated to pro-
duce an error of less than one second of
arc measure. The University group used
a variation of the former method. Since
the orbit of the Vanguard I was known
quite well, it was used as a target in
place of the sun or moon. The graph
was then sent to the Naval Research
Laboratory in Washington D.C., and the
error of the system was computed.
Minitrack Transmitter Used
The Vanguard satellite, from which
most signals come, contains two Mini-
track transmitters broadcasting on a
frequency of 108.999 mc and 108.030
mc with a power output of 10 and 5
milliwatts, respectively. The first trans-
mitter is powered by mercury batteries
with a minimum life expectancy of two
weeks. The weaker transmitter is ener-
gized by six solar cells arranged on the
surface of the satellite. This radio trans-
mitts whenever sunlight falls upon the
solar cells and should continue to broad-
cast for years.
The satellite contains another radio
which the Ann Arbor trackers cannot
receive: the telemetry system which relays
information on cosmic rays, micrometeo-
rite hits, the Earth's magnetic field, etc.
This transmitter is turned on by a radio
signal from the ground when the satellite
is over a Navy receiving station. The one
fact, however, besides location, that the
University students receive is the inside
temperature of the Vanguard. The crystal
in its transmitter is affected by the tem-
perature in the satellite and alters the
frequency it broadcasts on accordingly.
The frequency range of the radio will
vary from 108.923 mc to 108.036 mc
depending on the temperature of the
crystal.
Other Stations
The Navy has constructed nine similar
stations along the Equator with North-
South and East-West antenna legs. These
provide the most accurate data for com-
piling the orbit and receive the infor-
mation from the telemetry system. The
Navy stations and the various university
and other type groups comprise the offi-
cial MoonBeam tracking project. Supple-
menting this is the MoonWatch group
comprised of professional and amateur
astronomers. Once the general orbit of
the satellite is known, the MoonWatch-
ers can set up their telescopes along its
path. Each observer scans one section of
the sky. If the sun is below the horizon,
yet illuminating the satellite, the search-
ers may be able to see it. More often
they will be able to see the last stage of
the rocket that placed the satellite in
orbit. Being larger and tumbling, it is
seen as a pinpoint of flashing light. The
MoonWatch groups provide valuable
visual bearings that compliment and test
the accuracy of the bearings received by
the MoonBeam stations.
Although the station is not in opera-
tion full time since the operators are
students who have classes and studies,
it is furnishing valuable information on
the orbits of the earth satellites while
giving the students experience in prac-
tical application of their studies.

STEREO
"Tlie Majic IVotd in Music
Practically unheard of a year ago, stereophonic
sound has become a big business in the world
of entertainment.
Opncert-hall realism. A new dimen-
sion in sound. These are the terms
that have been applied to hi-fi, the re-
production of distortion-free andr real-
istic sound. After several years of
enthusiastically selling ordinary or mon-
aural high fidelity to the public, the
audio manufacturers are applying these
same expressions to what they claim is
far better than this—stereophonic sound.
In the past year or so, the stereo storm
has been brewing and now it has burst
with full force on the consumer market.
The thing is so new that thousands are
heading for their nearest hi-fi store and
purchasing stereo equipment without
knowing what it is and without even the
slightest knowledge of how it works.
Hi-Fi Came First
As those who have read the advertise-
ments for monaural equipment already
know, high fidelity differs from standard
reproduction in that sound is brought to
the listener without distortion. Hence,
the term high fidelity. All hookups
attempt to fill the listening room with a
full, clear sound which remains at the
proper volume level for all notes. Equip-
ment was perfected to reproduce even the
pitches out of the range of human hear-
ing since overtones, although not direct-
ly audible, do influence the quality of
the notes that can be heard. To maintain
low distortion throughout this wide range
of frequencies, it was found that high
powered amplifiers were necessary. Thus
audio engineers designed: pickups to
take the signal off the record or tape; pre-
amplifiers to control volume, bass, and
treble; amplifiers to boost the power level
to its desired heights; and finally speak-

Jay Sklar, a junior in Electrical
Engineering, was recently voted
into Eta Kappa Nu, the EE honor
society. Jay, who hails from Mass-
apequa Park, New York, graduated
from Hempstead High School on

ers to change the electrical signal to a
mechanical vibration. All these compo-
nents were constructed for wide frequency
response with little distortion.
Nevertheless, with all this effort to
yield conditions in the listening room
equivalent to those in the concert-hall,
something still was to be desired. The
sense of depth and direction was miss-
ing. Somehow, this dimension had to be
added. Lack of this final quality was
caused by the simple fact that while the
orchestra was spread out across a wide
stage and the violin and timpani sounds
came from different sides of the stage,
the loudspeaker was located at one point
in the listening room. Thus the listener
heard the orchestra as though it was
compressed into the small speaker box in
front of the room. To diversify the
sound, two speakers were added to the
output of the amplifier and this crude
method of spreading out the source be-
came the forerunner of stereophonic
sound.
Not A Solution
However, this solution by no means
ended the problem. The sound no long-
er came from a single point, but the
instruments still were not separated as
in the concert-hall. Then networks were
devised to separate the high from the
low notes. (This method had been used
previously in speaker systems to assign
to each of several speakers in the same
enclosure those notes which it repro-
duced most efficiently.) The higher
pitches were sent to one speaker called
a tweeter, and the lower ones were sent
to a woofer. Thus by separating the
speakers, the violins appeared to originate

from a different side of the room than
the timpani.
But this technique created a new
problem. The mid-range instruments,
producing notes at each end of the spec-
trum, seemed to move about as they
ranged over the scale. As they played
high notes, the sound came from one
side of the room. When low tones were
sounded, the apparent source shifted to
the other side. The effect of a symphony
played in this manner was rather like
that of an orchestra playing musical
chairs as they performed.
The whole trouble with methods of
this nature was that basically, each ear
was hearing the same sound. Indeed, this
is not the case in the concert-hall, where
the ears pick up signals slightly differ-
ent from one another.
The human brain includes a marvel-
ous computing system for determining
the direction of a sound's source. By a
combination of three techniques, a per-
son's senses can tell him fairly accurately
the direction from which a sound wave
comes.
First, as we all know, one ear is about
six inches from the other. The study of
physics shows us that sound travels at a
certain fixed velocity, 1100 feet per sec-
ond, in a wavelike motion. Putting this
information together, we come up with
the realization that sound coming from
the left arrives at the left ear about 450
microseconds sooner than it does at the
right ear. Wonderously, the human brain
can detect this difference. The ear is be-
lieved to be sensitive to a time difference
of six microseconds. Throughout most
music, there are a tremendous number of
transients . . . the beginning and end of
continuous tones. This situation provides
reference points for the ear. In this way,
if an instrument starts to play middle
C on your left, the beginning of the
tone is heard in the left ear before it is
heard in the right ear. Obviously, if the
instrument was playing middle C as you
walked into the room, you wouldn't
These instruments are part of the sound-
reproduction system which has fondly
been entitled stereophonic. Pictured
here are the following items: an AM-
FM tuner, a 25-watt amplifier, a turn-
table, and a high frequency speaker.
These elements will combine with the
rest of the unit to produce the concert-
hall-liice sounds of stereophonic.
know the source's direction. At least this
technique would not tell you.
Another Technique
However, the ear has another means
of determining location of sound. Since
sound travels in wavelike motions, and
as the ears are separated by a fixed dis-
tance, there is a phase difference in the
wave picked up by each ear. Consider a
tone of 1100 cycles per second. Its
wavelength is one foot and therefore,
one ear will hear a rarefaction while the
other is hearing a compression (the ears
are one half wavelength apart). Coordin-
ation between this detection system and
that determining the pitch gives the
brain a good indication of the sound's
location. However, this method is only
good for sounds of lower frequencies.
If a tone of higher than 2200 cycles
per second is played, the ear will have
no way of knowing how many full wave-
forms separate the compression and rare-
faction being felt. Thus, phase discrim-
ination is effective at lower tones, al-
though useless at high ranges.
However, the ear has another tech-
nique. Sound has the property of flow-
ing around an obstruction if the object
is much smaller than the wavelength.
As we go to higher frequencies, the wave-
length gets smaller and thus flow be-
comes less and less. One of these ob-
structions is the individual's head and
therefore at higher frequencies sound
coming from the left produces an inten-
sity shadow on the right. This differ-
ence in intensity can be felt by the ear
and direction is again determined.
Therefore the ear is a fairly good
directional mechanism. By means of trans-
ient detection, phase discrimination, and
intensity variation, it relays to the brain
much information concerning the loca-
tion of a sound source.
To get realistic sound reproduction,
it is necessary to put similar, but not
identical, signals into each ear. Just as

THE BATHYSPHERE
Even in this age of atomic submarines, man still
relies on the device that first unlocked the un-
derwater mysteries of the ocean —the bathy-
shere. by DON WITHERS,'61E
The oceans of the world have always
been a challenge and a mystery to
man. Not only is man unadapted to travel
naturally underwater, but somehow it is
thought that his very existance stems
from the sea. Even the earliest man
looked longingly at a deep river and
marvelled at the fishes swimming so
easily there. But the obstacles were too
great for early man to venture beneath
the waves.
History of the Diving Bell
The two obstacles that man has had
to overcome in his conquest of the sea
are a method of breathing artificially un-
der water and a safeguard against the
pressure exerted by the water.
The first divers were concerned only
with how far they could descend. Air
was supplied through breathing tubes or
reeds, the length of which almost always
kept the diver from going below three
feet.
Man wanted to go deeper into the
ocean, but the expansive power of his
lungs was unable to overcome the water
pressure below three feet. Another meth-
or of breathing which could not be
limited by pressure was necessary.
The diving bell with a self-contained
air supply was invented to fulfill this
need. The first recorded diving bell was
used in medieval Europe about 1600. It
consisted of a huge leather envelope
shaped like an inverted pail with weights
tied to the bottom. The device was
strapped to the driver's shoulders by
means of a harness.
The first modern diving bell appeared
about the same time. Created by Buona-
iuto Lorini, the bell was an inverted
wooden box filled with air with a stone
platform suspended beneath. The diver
stood on this platform and the device
was lowered from a ship. When on the
bottom, the diver would take a breath
of the compressed air, swim through
the water, and return to the bell for
another breath.
The astronomer and physicist Halley,
early in the eighteenth century, greatly
improved the diving bell by enlarging
the air chamber, devising a means of
changing the internal air, and using a
diving helmet connected to the bell.
Fresh air was lowered alternately by two
barrels while the stale air was exhausted
at the top by a stopcock. This diving
bell was capable of lowering five fully
clothed men and a lighted candle to a

sphere into the ship's hold.

and hose of the diver supplied adequate
air for breathing because the water com-
pressed the air in the bell.
One of the most important discoveries
which made deep sea diving bells possi-
ble was that of oxygen and a means of
greatly compressing it. This discovery
meant that only the oxygen in a diving
bell, not the entire air, need be replaced,
providing the carbon dioxide was kept
low.
Diving bells were at best awkward in
practical uses such as underwater salvage
and pearl collecting, being practically
immovable under water. Since salvage
could be accomplished more successfully
in diving suits and the sport of diving
became one of the air helmet and com-
pressed air tanks, only a few persons
(oceanographers) retained interest in the
diving bell.
One of the foremost oceanographers
was William Beebe, a man with a great
deal of experience in a diving helmet in
the South Pacific. He had studied tropical
fish underwater in his helmet as deep as
sixty feet but was unable to go deeper.
Thus he conceived of a pressure-tight
observation cylinder which could be
lowered deep into the ocean.
Features of the Bathysphere
The cylindrical design was soon
dropped in favor of a sphere, which
could withstand much more pressure. In
1929, Otis Barton designed and con-
structed a steel sphere capable of hous-
ing two men, being sealed, and descend-
ing extremely deep in the ocean. The
steel sphere measured four feet, nine
inches in diameter, an inch and a quarter
in thickness, and weighed five thousand
four hundred pounds. A previous casting
had been junked because its weight was
more than any of the available winches
could handle.
Three window ports were built into
the casting, into which quartz windows
three inches thick and eight inches in
diameter were securely bolted. Due to
breakage, only two quartz windows were
installed, a steel plug being used to
close up the third opening.
Main Illustration
Opposite the windows was the entrance
hole fourteen inches in diameter. When
the sphere was ready for a dive, a heavy
steel door was fitted over the opening
and tightened by ten large bolts around
the rim. The center of the steel door
contained a large wing nut with a
thread diameter of four inches.
The sphere was suspended from a
seven-eighth inch steel cable. Fastening
the cable to the sphere was accomplished
by spreading out the strands at the end
of the cable to form a cone. Liquid
white metal was poured around the cable
strands and the resulting solid cone
fitted into a corresponding swivel. Near
the swivel the one- and one-tenth inch
electric cable entered the sphere. The
tightly packed snuffing box was the most
dangerous spot for leakage, but the effi-
cient packing around the cable prevented
any leak.
As the sphere was lowered, the electric
cable was securely tied to the main cable

sphere" communication.
at hundred foot intervals to take the
strain from the four electric wires.
Electricity for the telephones and
illumination was supplied by a 110 volt,
1500 watt Kohler generator. Since the
voltage dropped twenty volts through the
half-mile of cable, special 90-volt lamps
were necessary. The telephones were or-
dinary 22-volt dry cell type instruments.
To handle the steel sphere a seven-
ton winch and sheaves, a large open-
decked barge, and a tugboat to tow the
barge were procured. The barge came
equipped with a mast, a derrick, and two
steam boilers capable of driving the
winch. Beebe named the steel craft the
bathysphere.
With the problem of pressure solved,
a breathable atmosphere in the bathy-
sphere was the next step. This consisted
of replenishing used oxygen and remov-
ing moisture and carbon dioxide. Oxygen
was supplied in two eighty gallon, eight-
een hundred pound pressure tanks, one
tank being sufficient for a dive. Moisture
was removed by trays of 8-mesh calcium
choloride carbon dioxide by 6-mesh soda
lime trays. The net results was that the
atmosphere remained as fresh as above
the surface and the humidity was com-
fortably maintained. Air was kept circu-
lating by a palm-leaf fan during a dive.
First Dives of the Bathysphere
The diving began in 1930 in Bermuda
off of Nonsuch Island. With the crew
and the members from New York Zoo-
logical Society on board, the barge was
towed eight miles out to sea. On June
third the bathysphere was lowered in a
test dive. The winches lowered it 200
feet at a time, clamps being placed on
the two cables at each interval. After
remaining at 2000 feet for some time,
the sphere was brought up.
It was found that the main cable had
slowly revolved forty-five times under-
water and the electric cable was wrapped
around it. The bathysphere was slowly
surfaced and the coils of electric cable
slipped down. One whole day was nec-
essary to untangle the two cables, but the
wires were unharmed and more impor-
tant, no water was found in the sphere.
The bathysphere was again sent down
on June sixth. This time the cable had
not turned at all and only a quart of
water was found inside.
With the second trial dive a success,
William Beebe and Otis Barton, the
manufacturer of the bathysphere, pre-
pared to dive. The inside of the sphere
was dried and the oxygen tanks and
chemical trays were seated in their racks.
The two men climbed in the fourteen
inch hole and seated themselves before
the window. Barton manned the telephone
while Beebe made the observations. The
heavy steel door was swung in place and
the ten equally spaced bolts and nuts
tightened. It was necessary to pound the
wrench with a sledge hammer to insure
a tight seal, and the racket was greatly
magnified inside the hollow steel sphere.
The bathysphere was then raised from
the deck of the barge and swung out
over the water. This position always un-
nerved the men inside slightly, for, al-
though the sphere was twenty feet away
from the barge, the quartz windows

DECENTRALIZATION
Plant location factors are important aspects in
today's big trend toward decentralization of
industry.
by BRYAN WHIPPLE, '61E
Look through the pages of any busi-
ness or news magazine these days.
Notice the number of advertisements
enticing industries to build new plants
in a certain region, along a certain rail-
road, or under the wires of a certain
power company. Industry is expanding.
Plants are on the move. Just as America's
people pioneered new regions, her indus-
tries are looking for new horizons. The
present scramble for factories by com-
munities and utilities, as exemplified by
slogans such as "consider Upstate New
York" "look south, young, young indus-
try" and many, many others, has become
so widespread that nearly every munici-
pality big enough to boast a chamber of
commerce has joined in, and has reached
such hectic proportions that the term
"pirating of industries" is often used.
But why are factories moving these
days? What makes one location superior
to another? As an engineer, what factors
must be evaluated to assist management
in choosing a site for a new factory, or
in relocating an existing one? And, if a
firm should decentralize, what type of
management organization is better—cen-
tralized or regional?
Many Theories
Many theories on plant location have
been advanced. Most of these are too
theoretical to be of great value to an
individual firm seeking to locate a single
plant in the jungle of freight rates, wage
scales, taxes, markets, and resources of
our intricately ordered industrial organ-
ization. While a professional industrial
geographer should have a working knowl-
edge of location theory, in practice site
decisions tend to be empirical rather than
theoretical. This discussion will be lim-
ited to more fundamental, practical con-
siderations. If each is given proper
weight, according to the needs of the
individual firm, they may prove sufficient.
At the dawn of industrial America,
location of industries was far simpler.
Firms were smaller and transportation
less efficient. Factories sprang up near
markets, usually in the town of the own-
ers' residence. As transportation routes
stretched westward, factories spread out
along thin lines away from the seaboard.
Development of important trade and
transportation centers in the midwest, to-
gether with the development of America's
own mining centers, brought about a
clumping of industries at the intersections
of trade routes, such as Detroit and Chi-
cago. These established industrial centers
are now mature. The changing labor and
goods markets, an adequate transporta-
tion network, taxes, the exigencies of
national defense, and many other factors
have made the reasons for industrial cen-
ters relatively less important. Also many
firms have assessed regional versus cen-
tral production and have found that the
saving in transportation costs from a
regional plant setup gives them a much-
needed edge on their centralized com-
petitors.
The right location for a plant is both
very important and quite difficult to deter-
mine. In many industries a differential
of ten percent in manufacturing and dis-
tributing costs occurs between competi-
tors purely from geographical considera-
tions. Further, every manufacturing cost
is dependent on the location of the plant.
Thus, industrial location is not a problem
to be considered lightly.
Labor Factor
Labor is one of the prime concerns of
a firm on the move. One might start an
analysis of a proposed location by exam-
ining the availability of the work force
needed for the proposed plant. Popula-
tion lying within a 20-mile radius of the
site is usually considered as potential
labor supply. How large the population
within this radius must be in order to
meet requirements will depend on wheth-
er special skills or general labor is
required, and on the sociological group
or groups predominating. Unless similar
industries are abundant nearby, men will
have to be trained to fill many positions.
It is seldom advisable to "import" a
supply of skilled labor.
When analyzing population figures,
the number of unemployed and unusual-

close scrutiny. In addition, females who
did not previously constitute a part of
the labor market may be employable.
Be certain that population figures do not
include institutionalized persons. Con-
sider the commuting habits of the com-
munity, which may substantially increase
the potential labor force. Labor unions
and government statistics provide the
most accurate data on the amount and
types of labor available. Not all of the
unemployed work force can be tapped
however, there is always some "frictional
unemployment" due to workers changing
jobs, and to the seasonal nature of some
industries. Particularly in resort and fish-
ing regions, where employment fluctu-
ates during the year, workers tend to
leave their "steady" jobs briefly to take
higher-paying jobs in the seasonal indus-
tries.
In general, the availability of labor is
difficult to determine accurately, and it
is well to allow for considerable devia-
tion from expected supply.
Wages Important
The cost of labor is related to its
availability, and is a key factor in decid-
ing on a region for a new plant, if not
in selecting the community. Wage rates
in fresh, undeveloped areas are widely
believed to be lower than in older, estab-
lished industrial communities. While this
is undoubtedly true, new industries in
an area will generally effect an upgrading
of the area's occupational level, bring
a higher standard of living, and eventual-
ly result in rising wages. This is particu-
larly true after the labor force in the new
area tends toward unionization. While
the short-range labor outlook in new
areas is favorable, in a society as mobile
as ours increasing standardization of
wages must be expected in the long run.
Many industries that relocated to take

as industry, in its new decentralized lo-
cations, keeps its connections with the
urban areas.

advantage of lower wages elsewhere are
finding that they and the other firms that
followed them have used up the excess
labor supply and licked the frosting off
their man-hour cake.
Indeed, merely because a man can be
employed to do a job for less does not
make him a better bargain. Just as some-
one can make any product a little more
poorly and sell it a little more cheaply,
someone will always be willing to per-
form a task less well for less wages.
Workers from low-standard-of-living
communities often rate lower in such
costly areas as absenteeism, unsafe meth-
ods, pilferage, and high turnover.
These considerations constitute employ-
ee stability. A worker can be a valuable
asset to the firm if he stays with the
firm long, works safely, and is regular.
Another aspect of employee stability that
merits investigation in a community un-
der study is the strike record. A town
that has a history of unusually long or
violent strikes may prove to be a bad
risk.
Finally, the laws regulating labor in the
state and muncipality of interest should
be examined in light of the company's
needs. What are the minimum wage laws?
Does the state have a right-to-work law?
Fair employment practices law? What
about workmen's compensation? The state
and community attitude toward labor and
labor legislation may be important in the
long-run outlook. All of these factors
will be of different relative importance
in nearly every instance, and care must
be used in estimating their net effect on
wages.
Fuel Costs
Resources are another compelling fac-
tor in the shifting pattern of industry.
Nearly every manufacturing industry re-
quires some sort of fuel, such as coal,
oil, or gas. Those which use fuel to
generate their own electric power will
be especially concerned with fuel costs.
For the present we shall consider fuels
as sources of thermal energy rather than
as raw materials. Thus they become com-
petitive, and may be readily substituted
for one another.
Bituminous coal, a tremendously im-
portant industrial fuel which is in rela-
tively abundant supply, is produced prin-
cipally in West Virginia, Pennsylvania,
Kentucky, and Illinois. Coal is also mined
in scattered regions throughout the coun-
try, but is generally inferior. Price as
well as caloric value per pound determine
the cost of coal as a fuel. Transportation
costs account for a large percentage of
the cost of coal, however, and local coal
often proves more economical. If fuel
costs are any appreciable percentage of
production costs, coal heat values and
freight rates should be scrutinized for
each location under consideration.
Natural gas is the least expensive of
fuels at present, although the future
outlook will depend on finding new gas
fields as old fields are exhausted. The
eventual depletion of the nation's gas

More and more men are realizing that human
factors as well as mechanical are important in
today's production methods. by DONALD A. GORDON
Man-machine systems of great com-
plexity are becoming common in
today's industrial and military establish-
ments. The necessity of dealing with
these systems has created the new tech-
nology of Human Engineering. The
Human Engineer attempts to design the
machine in the light of the operator's
capabilities and limitations, and advises
on the division of labor between man
and machine.
The idea of designing for human use
is not new—it has always been implicit
in equipment construction. The cave man
must have considered strength and hand
size when he designed his stone-age axe.
The explicit consideration of human
factors, however, is a recent development.
It came about during World War II, as
the result of experience in designing
fighter planes. It became apparent that
military aircraft were taxing the human's
ability to function. Under conditions of
high g-pressure, the pilot was required
to deal with an overwhelming number
of displays and controls, (see Fig. 1).
The Human Engineering solution was to
redesign the equipment to bring the
tasks within the pilot's performance
capacity.
The principles formulated in cockpit
design were later applied to other aero-
nautical, electronic, and mechanical
equipment. Human Engineering groups
were created in military and industrial
establishments. The widespread accept-
ance of these principles is indicated by
the standard clause, in military procure-
ment contracts, which requires that the
equipment be given Human Engineering
attention.
The new demand for Human Engin-
eers has created a critical shortage of
trained practitioners. To remedy the
situation, courses in the subject have
been set up at Harvard, Johns Hopkins,
Ohio State, and the University of Cali-
fornia, among other educational institu-
tions. At the University of Michigan, a
course was initiated in the Industrial
Engineering Department last Fall (I.E.
125), and others are being planned in
the Psychology Department.
Human Engineering the Automobile
Within the automobile industry, re-
search on Human Engineering is current-
ly being performed at Chrysler (Dr.
John Versache), General Motors (Dr.
David Learner) and at Ford (Leonard
Jensen and Lyman Forbes).
The automobile and driver, together,
may be considered as a system perform-
ing a transportation function. The driver
obtains information about his machine
from visual displays—the speedometer,
temperature, and oil pressure gauges,
etc., and in turn influences the machine
by manipulating the controls—the accel-
erator, steering wheel, brakes, etc. The
visual displays should be easy for the eye
to see and the mind to comprehend,
and they must furnish the required infor-
mation. The controls must be within the
driver's limits of reach and strength,
and positioned to avoid confusion. The
seating arrangement should provide ade-
quate space; the ride must be comforta-
ble. The automobile should be usable by
prospective drivers without requiring ex-
cessive training. Realizing these objec-
tives, and solving the related problems
is the concern of the Human Engineer.
McFarland and his associates at Har-
vard University have made a review of
truck models manufactured in 1956.
Many and serious defects were noted.
Some speedometers read as high as 110
miles per hour. Since such speeds are
never reached, their inclusion in a dial
causes crowding in the useful portion of
the scale. Over a fifth of the controls
were placed too far from the driver to
be comfortably reached. Many controls
were crowded against other controls.
Foot brakes, for example, were placed
under the steering wheel column, gear
shifts too close to the brakes. McFar-
land proposed that vehicle cabs have the
minimum dimensions shown in Fig 2.
These dimentions will safely accomodate
95% of the population.

This is, as you've probably already
guessed, an aircraft instrument panel.
The difficulty in reading and reacting
to this type of display, especially under
adverse flying conditions, gave impetus
to the development of Human Engineer-
ing.
Experimentation on Indicator
Instruments
Human Engineering experimentation
differs from both Engineering (equip-
ment) and Psychological (human) re-
search, as it is the man-and-machine sys-
tem performance that is measured. The
machine must be typical and in good
working order; the man's training, moti-
vation and fatigue must be carefully con-
trolled. An evaluation of an indicator
instrument, carried out in the Industrial
Engineering Department this Summer,
will serve to illustrate this type of ex-
periment. The instrument, a "Dimension
Indicator" is used to show distance of
travel on industrial machines (see Fig-
ure 3). The valuation was carried out
on a group of students who had had no
experience with lathe work, and on a
group of machine shop operators with
an average of 25 years experience. It was
found that the new device was equal in
accuracy to the standard method, gave
over iy/r more output per unit time,
and required less training.
Human Engineering Research at the
University of Michigan
A number of University of Michigan
scientists have made contributions to the
Human Engineering literature. Professor
Paul Hunsicker, Chairman of the Physi-
cal Education Department founded a
research laboratory for the investigation

of body strength. Studies were made of
arm strength of men in the sitting and
prone positions. Professor F. Thieme,
former Chairman of the Anthropology
Department, made and published exten-
sive anthropometric measurements of
school age children. Professor Wilfred
T. Demster, of the Anatomy Department,
has been concerned with human joint and
limb mobility. He has published articles
on the space requirements of seated oper-
ators. Professor Paul M. Fitts, Depart-
ment of Psychology, has been active in
Human Engineering since its inception.
His pioneer research on aviation equip-
ment has set the direction of much sub-
sequent work.
The Future—Man in Space
One of the most challenging problems
that Human Engineers will have to assist
with is designing a manned space ship.
Human problems of space travel are al-
ready being studied at a number of mili-
tary and industrial laboratories.* The
procedure for designing a human space
ship follows that of developing more
earthbound systems, although the prob-
lems are more numerous and difficult. An
analysis must first be made of what the
system must do. Functions may then be
allocated between the man and machine.
In navigating to the moon, the vehicle
may depart from the earth or space sta-
tion, acquire and adjust to a selected
orbit, move to a new orbit around the
moon, approach and land on a suitable
landing spot etc. Each phase must be
analyzed to see what duties the man can

with human factors in space travel are: The
School of Aviation Medicine, USAF, Texas,
the Aero Medical Laboratory, WADC, Ohio,

man AFB, New Mexico, Army Medical Re-
search Laboratory, Kentucky, and the Navy
Medical Research Laboratory, Johnsville, Pa.

carrying on this research.
best perform, displays must be developed
to give him the required information, and
controls designed for making the needed
adjustments. Both displays and controls
must be combined into a functional
pattern.
Space travel imposes novel stresses on
the human operator. He will be exposed
to multiple-g forces, as well as weight-
lessness. There will be danger from
meteorites, cosmic rays, and other un-
predictable forces. The 24-hour cycle of
day and night which normally guides our
routine may be replaced by duty cycles
of eight or even four hours. And there
will be psychological effects of isolation
and confinement to be reckoned with.
Reduction in sensory stimulation has
been shown to have a serious effect on
normal functioning. In one series of ex-
periments, subjects were confined to
severely reduced stimulation for several
days. The subject lay on a bed, in a
small soundproof cubicle, 24 hours a
day, with time off only for eating and
going to the toilet. The room was always
lighted. He wore transluscent goggles
which transmitted diffuse light, but pre-
vented pattern vision. Touch stimulation
was limited by gloves and cardboard cuffs.
Auditory stimuli were restricted by a U-
shaped foam rubber pillow covering the
ears. Wires were attached to the subject's
scalp to permit the experimenter to re-
cord his brain waves.
At first, the subjects slept. Later, they

DEARBORN CENTER
The opening of the Dearborn Center is another
milestone in the expansion of the University of
Michigan.
by SUE OH, '61E
In 1956, the Ford Motor Company
presented the University of Michigan
with 210 acres of Dearborn land, in-
cluding the Ford estate. The stipulation
made was that it and the $6,500,000,
courtesy of the Ford Motor Company
Fund, be used for development of a
Dearborn branch of the University. The
combined donation constituted the larg-
est contribution ever made by a company
to an educational institution.
As we all know, there is a great need
at the present time for college and uni-
versity expansion. College enrollments
are expected to swamp existing facilities
within the next two decades. The Uni-
versity itself anticipates on campus a
student body in excess of 40,000 by
1970. Not only is the number of appli-
cants rising, but industry demands more
and more engineers, scientists, and busi-
ness administrators yearly.
This situation is particularly acute in
Wayne county; a study made of the sit-
uation indicated that Dearborn was the
ideal place to set up a future branch.
Dearborn is at the center of a rapidly
growing area and the majority of its
citizens is employed in the type of job
calling for a college education. Appar-
ently, the Dearborn Center of the Uni-
versity of Michigan (as it is officially
known) comes none too soon.
Construction Started
Construction on the four buildings of
the Center was begun in April of this
year. These buildings will be the fol-
lowing:
1. Classroom building; 28 classrooms,
2 lecture halls, 4 research offices, 5 engi-
neering design rooms, nurse's office, and
the following laboratories: 2 biological,
2 chemistry, 1 physics, 1 psychology,
1 statistics.
2. Engineering laboratory; 9 comput-
ing rooms, 10 offices, and space for
laboratory course work in automotive,
fluid flow, engine ring mechanics, elec-
trical, metallurgical, machine tools.
3. Faculty office building; 40 single
offices, 25 doubles or triples, 8 secretarial,
2 seminar rooms.
4. Student activities building; library
facilities, including open stacks, audio
room, typing room. Building will also
house a snack bar, faculty dining room,
kitchen, food storage area, multi-purpose
areas (student dining, entertaining or
social events).
Physical education facilities :ind an
auditorium were considered, but too little
money is available to finance these nice-
ties. Ideas have been put forth for the
use of the 1914 vintage Fair Lane, home
of Henry Ford I, but as yet no plan has
been decided upon.
The land is 28 miles from Ann Arbor,
and 11 miles from downtown Detroit.
As received, most of the land is farmland
or wooded, and requires utilities, roads,
sewers, etc. What is left of the $6,500,-
000 gift after $4,200,000 erects the
buildings, and $1,000,000 furnishes them
will be spent on this improvement.
Not "Little U of M"
The Dearborn Center will not be sim-
ply a "little U of M," but an indepen-
dent unit, which will work closely with
Henry Ford Community College, Dear-
born's 2-year junior college. Since HFCC
is already well established, the Center
will not attempt to repeat work now be-
ing adequately done, but will continue
on the junior, senior, and graduate levels.
Undergraduate studies in literature,
science and arts, industrial and mechani-
cal engineering, and business administra-
tion will be conducted. For those who
wish to earn a Master's degree, graduate
work in engineering and business admin-
istration will be offered. Together,
HFCC and the Dearborn Center will pro-
vide the area's students with 4 years of
undergraduate and 1 year of graduate
college opportunity. Not only full time
students will be welcomed, but late after-

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


This model of the much-needed Dear-
born center shows the four buildings
which will be completed about the mid-
dle of this year. These structures are
slated to be the following: a classroom
building, an engineering laboratory, a
faculty office building, and a student
activities building.
noon and evening classes will be con-
ducted for the convenience of people
who are full time employees.
The Dearborn Center will represent
the University's first real effort in the
field of co-operative education. Many
schools throughout America offer this
type of program; the University of Cin-
cinnati was first in 1906. The work-
experience plan is most often associated
with engineering, but at the Center, it
will be applied to business administration
and in some part to liberal arts; there
is no good reason why it can't be suc-
cessful.
The expected enrollment is 2,700
students, broken down as follows: 600
liberal arts, 500 undergraduate and 300
graduate business administration, 1,000
undergraduate and 350 graduate engi-
neering. The Center will be run on the
quarterly system to accommodate the co-
operative plan; that is, students will have
two 3-month periods of course study and
two 3-month periods on the job. They
will be paired off; one will study at the
Center while the other has supervised
job-experience. Because of this, only
half of the student body will be on cam-
pus at any given time.
Stirton Named Director
On the first of October, the appoint-
ment of Dr. William Stirton as vice-
president and director of the Dearborn
Center went into effect. Dr. Stirton is
qualified because of his years of experi-
ence as principal of Detroit's Cass Tech-
nical High School and as vice-president of
both Wayne State University and the
University of Michigan. Dr. Stirton says
that the admission standards, quality of
instruction, and student performance will
be at least as high as those on the Ann
Arbor campus. He feels that the appli-
cants may require more careful sifting
to find the ones right for the particular
type of program to be carried on there.
Co-op Advantages
Co-operative education has several ad-
vantages as pointed out by President
Harlan Hatcher in a statement regarding
educational policy at the Center.
1. The student picks his career more
intelligently. There is less waste of his
educational opportunities. The student
doesn't get the wrong impression of his
future job, running the risk of disillu-
sionment after graduation.
2. A high degree of individual atten-
tion makes for rapid advancement.
3. The financial burden is lighter.
Better use is made of talented resources
which otherwise might go to waste, if
an "on-campus" college education is too
expensive.
However, the co-operative plan is not
designed to let the student "earn while
he learns." Work-experience is an in-
tegral part of the total educational pro-
gram.
A Literary College study has this to
say:
"High academic quality is the para-
mount requirement. The aims of co-
operative education do not differ from

Only the methods of achieving those

Each job (provided under the co-
operative plan) must yield educational
values and supplement and vitalize the
theoretical instruction. There must be
a progressive increase in the demands
and responsibilities of successive jobs
as the student gains in experience and
maturity. Earnings, convenience of loca-
tion or the preference of the student
must yield to educational advantages, if
these advantages cannot be achieved
otherwise."

The Dearborn Center of the University

September, 1959—but chances are it
won't. The University's operating budget
has been so drastically cut that several
University projects have been curtailed
or completely dropped because of finan-
cial straits. At a time when college fa-
cilities are needed so badly, it would in-
deed be a shame for the Dearborn Center
to have to wait another year.

The Willgoos Turbine Engine Test Facility is the world's most
extensive privately owned turbine development laboratory. De-
signed and built specifically to test full-scale experimental en-
gines and components in environments simulating conditions at
extreme altitudes and speeds, it is currently undergoing expan-
sions that will greatly increase its capacity for development test-
ing of the most advanced forms of air breathing systems.


In chambers like this at the Willgoos Turbine
Engine Test Facility full-scale engines may be
tested in environments which simulate condi-
tions from sea level to 100,000 feet. Mach 3
conditions can also be simulated here.

In the new Fuel Systems Laboratory engineers
can minutely analyze the effects of extreme en-
vironmental conditions on components of fuel
systems — conditions such as those encoun-
tered in advanced types of flight vehicles
operating at high Mach numbers and high alti-
tudes. Fuel for these tests can be supplied at
any temperature from —65°F to +500°F.

As we are beginning a new year, it
would be a good idea to resolve
that we are going to work out some of
these teasers before we turn to the an-
swer page. To help you get off to the
right start and to give you some moral
support, I'll start you out with some very
easy teasers.
Rich Mr. Vanderford buys a bottle of
very old French brandy in a liquor store.
The price is $45.00. When the store
owner hands him the wrapped bottle, he
asks Mr. Vanderford to do him a favor.
He would like to have the old bottle
back to put on display in his window,
and he would be willing to pay for the
empty bottle. "How much?" asks Mr.
Vanderford. "Well," the store owner
answers, "the full bottle costs $45.00 and
the brandy costs $40.00 more than the
empty bottle. Therefore, the empty
botttle is . . ." "Five dollars," inter-
rupts Mr. Vanderford, who, having
made a lot of money, thinks he knows
his figures better than anyone else.
"Sorry, sir, but you can't figure," says
the liquor dealer and he was right. Why?
* * *
In a Tennessee mountain community
the miller retains as his fee one-tenth
of the corn the mountaineer delivers for
grinding. How much corn must a farmer
deliver to get back 100 pounds of corn
meal, providing there is no loss?
* * *
In how many ways can you express
1,000 as the sum of two or more consecu-
tive numbers?
* * *
Reducing fractions may seem quite ele-
mentary but don't skip over this one, for
it should give you quite a workout.
If we delete the numeral occurring in
both the numerator and denominator of
the fraction 26/65 we don't change its
value because 26/65 = 2/5. What other
fractions consisting of two-digit figures
in the numerator and denominator can
be similarly reduced?
* * *
You say you're having trouble and
need another moral booster? Okay, here
it comes.
This is suposed to have happened in
London during the war. The sirens
screamed; all lights go out. A man
jumps out of bed and starts running for
the air raid shelter. Then he realizes that
it will be cold in the basement and that
he had better get a pair of socks. He
turns back and opens the drawer which
holds his stockings. Only then is he
aware that all the lights are out, which
makes it impossible for him to see what
he grabs in the drawer. He is a man of
self-respect and order and would hate to
be seen with two socks of different colors.
He knows that the drawer contains noth-
ing but black and brown socks which,
unfortunately, he cannot distinguish in
the darkness. Now, what is the mini-
mum number of socks the man must
grab to be sure he will find a matched
pair among them when he reaches the
shelter?
* * *
That will be all the gifts for this
month. This next one may seem difficult
but it can be solved by following a logi-
cal pattern.
Express the number 1,234,567 as the
difference of the cubes of two consecutive
numbers.
Many, many years ago, a king decided
to reward the inventor of the game of
chess. The inventor was a very wise
person and asked the king to place one
grain of wheat on the first square of his
chess board, two on the second, four on
the third, eight on the fourth, etc. The
king was very pleased with this, for he
thought the man would ask for gold or
jewels. However, the king was never
able to fulfill his promise. Why?
* * *
Many of you have heard the question,
"Which weighs more, a ton of feathers
or a ton of bricks'" Well, let's see you
answer this one.
What is the difference in weight be-
tween 5,760 lbs. of feathers and 7,000
lbs. of gold? Don't be hasty. It isn't as
easy as it looks.
* * *
A ship sprang a leak and a square
piece was needed to mend the hole. The
only piece available was shaped like the
diagram. The captain wanted this to be
cut into the least number of pieces to
form a perfect square. The carpenter
could do no better than five pieces, but
the captain showed him how to do it
with less. What can you do?

"...what arouses our moral feeling at the thought of a
future cessation of all living creation on earth, remote as
this may be, is above all the question whether all life is but
an aimless sport, which will ultimately fall prey to destruc-

we begin to see that not only pleasure and joy, but also
pain, struggle, and death, are the powerful means by which
nature has built up her finer and more perfect forms of life.
And we men know that in our intelligence, our civic order,
and our morality we are livi ng on the inheritance which
our forefathers gathered for us through labor, struggle, and
sacrifice; we also know that what we acquire will in like
manner ennoble the lives of our descendants. Thus the

if in a modest position and in a limited sphere of activity,
can bear without fear the thought that the thread of his
own consciousness will one day break."

UPPER AIR RESEARCH
edited by BOB RUSNAK, '60E
The experiment had reached its crit-
ical stage. University of Michigan
researchers and engineers waited expec-
tantly to see if their long hours of work
would be successful. With a brilliant
flash, the booster stage of Nike-Cajun
AM 6.02 rocket ignited and started the
University's upper-air research instru-
ments on their long climb to the fringes
of space. Two and one-half seconds
later, at an altitude of 5,300 feet, the
booster burned out. It separated, and the
Cajun rocket coasted up to 28,300 feet
in 11.5 seconds, where its rocket ignited
for two seconds and propelled the rocket
to a height of 515,925 feet. On its way
up, the rocket ejected a 7.5" sphere at
178,000 feet. The sphere coasted to
about the same altitude as the rocket and
then fell to earth, telemetering to the
ground valuable information on the den-
sity of the upper-atmosphere.
This was the first falling sphere experi-
ment carried out by the University's
Aeronautical Engineering department at
Fort Churchill, Manitoba, Canada
(59°N) as part of the United States'
IGY program. Three other similar ex-
periments were successfully carried out
at Fort Churchill in the early part of
1958. The department also conducted
experiments determining winds and tem-
peratures at very high altitudes during
the IGY from Fort Churchill, which is
on Hudson's Bay. The Electrical Engin-
eering department conducted experiments
measuring the ambient pressure and tem-
perature of the upper air.
Two Rockets
The two rockets used to propel these
experiments to the upper-atmosphere
were the Nike-Cajun, recently developed
by the University and NACA, and the
Aerobee, in use since 1948. The Nike-
Cajun, a solid-propellant two-stage
sounding rocket, consists of the Nike anti-
aircraft missile booster and the Cajun,
a solid fuel version of the Deacon. At
Michigan, a coasting period between the
booster burnout and the Cajun ignition
was predicted and fins and a nose cone
for the Cajun were developed to with-
stand the increased aerodynamic loading.
The first test firings of this combination
were carried out at the NACA test site
at Wallops Island, Va., in June, 1955.
These rockets, instrumented with the fall-
ing sphere experiment, performed suc-
cessfully, reaching an altitude of approx-
imately 348,000 feet.
The complete rocket system is approxi-
mately 26' long, 16.5" at its greatest
diameter, and weighs 1550 lbs at take-
off. The Cajun at separation weighs 250
lbs. and can carry a payload of 50 lbs.
Relatively inexpensive, the Cajun costs
$4,000 with fins, exclusive of instrumen-
tation and booster. The boosters used by
the University have been donated by U. S.
Army Ordnance. The launcher, a modified
Nike launcher, is power operated and
does not require a major launching in-
stallation. The most convenient feature
is the solid propellant which eliminates
fueling, tanks, pumps, pressure checks,
and other operations making a trained
firing crew necessary. The main features
of the system are the booster fins of
welded magnesium plate and casting
construction, hinged together, specially
developed for the high aerodynamic
loads encountered; the unmodified Nike
booster; the cast magnesium coupling,
which separates the booster at burnout
by differential drag, the Cajun fins, per-
haps the most difficult part of the design,
are made from extruded Dural and are
hinged together; and the Cajun itself,
a threaded bottle to which the fins and
nose cone are screwed.
The Aerobee
Developed by the Navy, the Aerobee
can carry a payload of 150 lbs to an
altitude of 400,000-800,000 feet, de-
pending on the model. The 20' rocket
is 15" in diameter and uses red fuming
nitric acid and aniline as propellants. It
is coupled to a 575-lb. solid propellant
booster that burns for 2.5 seconds and
brings the Aerobee to a velocity of about
1000 feet per second. The main engine
functions for 45 seconds and boosts the
velocity to 3,500 miles per hour. The
Aerobee is launched from a tower that
has rails to guide the rocket on the first
part of its flight. The Aerobee is the
first American-developed sounding rocket
and has been the backbone of research
in this country for the past ten years.
The University has been actively en-
gaged in developing better and simpler
sounding rockets and support equipment
for the use of universities and other
small groups for the past five years. The
first rocket developed was the Nike-
Cajun, of which about seventy will be
fired by various agencies during the IGY.
Recently developed was the Exos, a three-
stage combination of the Nike booster,
Honest John, and the Recruit. This is
one of the possible choices for a vehicle

NASA for the development of rockets
and instrumentation for synoptic meas-
urements of temperature, density, press-
ure, and composition of the air in the
320,000-650,000 feet region. The rocket
choice is to be made this spring, and the
first firings will take place by the end of
the year. Another sounding rocket now in
development is the combining of five
slightly modified current solid-propellant
rockets to form a vehicle to propel a
payload to the altitude of 1000 miles.
Big Obstacle
In the study phase is an attitude con-
trol system for small sounding rockets,
such as the Exos. This system would
combine a gyro sensor and auxiliary
vernier jets. Devices of this type are com-
monly used by the military, but are far
too expensive and complex for small
groups. The University is also develop-
ing computer techniques to facilitate the
automatic reduction of data received from
the sounding rockets. This was on big
obstacle in the path of all researchers.
The actual experiment took only a few
minutes, but useful information could

not be received for months. Again, the
military and other big groups use com-
puters to break this bottleneck, but they
are too big and expensive for use by
small groups. The raw data received from
Michigan's Fort Churchill firings are now
undergoing reduction on the group's
small computer.
The aforementioned experiment with
the falling sphere to measure upper-
atmosphere density was carried out by
the Aeronautical Engineering department

under sponsorship of the Air Force
Cambridge Research Center. The retard-
ation of a falling body is proportional
to the size, velocity, and coeffecient of
drag of the body, which are known, and
the density of the air through which it
is falling. The sphere is constructed of
aluminum, is 7" in diameter, and weighs
11 lbs. It contains a transit-time accelero-
meter which measures the drag accelera-
tion directly. This is accomplished by a
small bobbin equidistant from the sides
of its chamber. As the sphere falls, the
bobbin is centered in its container and
released. The bobbin and the sphere are
then falling at the same rate. As the
atmospheric drag slows the sphere, and
the bobbin chamber, the bobbin's inertia
causes it to contact the side of the cham-
ber. In low density air, the time from

developed Nike-Cajun and its launcher

The fins, which were developed by the
University expressly for this 26-foot,
1550-pound rocket, are clearly visible
in the picture.

bobbin release to bobbin contact is great-
er than in denser air. The bobbin is
centered, released, and contacts the side
of the chamber many times during the
sphere's fall. The times of release and
contact are telemetered to the ground,
where they are used to calculate the air
density. Using this data, it is also possible
to calculate the ambient air temperature.
Rocket-Grenade
Ten successful firings from Fort Chur-
chill by the University in conjunction
with the Signal Corp have carried rocket-
grenade experiments to high altitudes to
determine upper-air temperature and
winds. The vehicle carrying the experi-
ment was the previously described
Aerobee. In this experiment, each rocket
contained nineteen 2-and 4-lb grenades
and ejected them at intervals between
81,000 and 310,000 feet. The intensity
and angle of the grenade's explosion's
sound waves returning to earth were
measured and used to compute tempera-
ture and wind velocity and direction. A
6-gm charge of black powder ejects each
grenade. The grenade is attached to a
14' lanyard which pulls the grenade de-
tonating pin. The last grenade is fired
with a lanyard length of a few inches to
destroy any unfired grenades. The ground
equipment consists of nine T-23 hot-
wire microphones arranged in a North-
South and an East-West leg. Although
only three microphones would determine
the two angles of arrival of the sound
waves, the extra microphones "smooth

out" the meteorological effects on them.
On the ground is a DOVAP (Doppler
Velocity and Position) tracker which
determines where the grenades were
ejected. Ballistic cameras were also in-
stalled at Fort Churchill to complement
the DOVAP system in determining the
grenade explosion co-ordinates.
The University's Electrical Engineering
department fired 12 Nike-Cajuns instru-
mented with Alphatron pressure gauges
for measuring upper-air pressure, temper-
ature, and density. The Alphatron is an
ionization gauge that utilizes a radio-
active ionizing element. Pressures meas-
ured by the gauges, along with data from
the ground tracking units, are used to
calculate the experimental results.
As busy as the Michigan researchers
have been during IGY and the preceding
years, they are not content to stop now.
A group of nine recently returned from
Guam in the Pacific where they carried
out the grenade experiment. The Univer-
sity is continuing development of simple,
inexpensive sounding rockets for small
groups. Definitely included among future-
plans is the instrumenting of satellites
to be fired in the U. S. earth-satellite
program. After that, plans are not final-
ized. But it is certain that whenever and
wherever research is being conducted,
the University of Michigan will be one
of the prime agencies.
The atmospheric density as it relates to
the retardation of a falling body was
investigated with the use of this 7-inch
diameter, 11-pound sphere. The small
size of the instrument is quite startling
in comparison with the number of de-
vices which it contains. The figure in the
open sphere stays on the ground.

Recorded Sound's History
by KEN DEC, '61E
Within the past five years Hi Fi
and Stereo have become important
supplements to the field of entertainment.
Previous to these innovations, the phon-
ograph was used to bring many happy
hours of relaxation to the world. Both
the new innovations, and the basic in-
vention itself depend on one principle—
Recorded Sound. Most people have some
idea of the history of the recording in-
dustry, from the turn of the century to
the present; but few individuals know
of the very early developments which
laid the foundations for the success of
the recording industry. Most of these
developments came in the short span of
25 years, and were based on the extensive
research of several pioneers in the elec-
trical acoustical fields.
The very first recording machine was,
of course, made by Thomas Edison in
1877. Edison was, at the time, working
on the improvement of the telegraph,
but noticed that the rapid punching of
a ticker tape gave a musical, if not hu-
man sound. He reasoned that the human
voice, due to its varied frequency, could
be recorded on some sort of tape or drum
mechanism.
Edison then ran several experiments
by using a diaphram connected to an em-
bossing point to impress voice waves on
paraffin paper or tin foil. Based on these
experiments, he sketched a machine
which he believed would record and re-
produce sound waves. The sketch was
given to one of Edison's mechanics, John
Kruise, and within 30 hours Kruise had
the apparatus built.
It consisted basically of a metal cylin-
der with fine spiral groves impressed in
its surface, and two diaphram needle
units, one for recording and one for
reproduction. The cylinder was mounted
on a screw, which, when turned with a
hand crank, would both revolve and
move from left to right. A piece of tin
foil was mounted on the cylinder and
the recording needle would follow the
spiral groove to indent a pattern of
sound vibrations directed into the mouth-
piece. The stylus moved vertically, cre-
ating a "hill and dale" pattern in the
trough of the groove. On replay, the
reproduction needle would convert the
impressions back into sound waves.
On receiving this mechanism from
Kruise, Edison quickly mounted a piece
of tinfoil on the cylinder, turned the
crank, and uttered the profound state-
ment, "Mary had a little lamb" into the
diaphram. The diaphrams wer e then
changed, the machine reset, and the
crank once again turned. In the stillness
of that room recorded sound was born.
So impressed was Edison with the repro-
duction of his voice that he said, "I was
never so taken back in all my life."
Edison then proceeded to patent his
invention as the "phonograph." The first
few models were merely a means of re-
peating, once or twice, a few spoken
words. True, it was a great invention,
but it was useless. The "record" was only
good for two or three plays. After this
the impressions were destroyed, and no
recognizable sound was produced. The
tinfoil records could not be removed
without destroying the ability to play
back the impressions. Lastly, it was im-
possible to duplicate one record, and
therefore each was unique. Even with
these handicaps, some records and record-
ing machines were put on the market and
sold to the public.
The first commercial machines of any
significance to come on the market were
called "Gramaphones." Invented by
Charles Tainter and Chichester Bell,
these machines were much like Edison's,
but possessed definite advantages. The
gramaphone used a special point to en-
grave or cut a groove in wax, instead of
tinfoil. The cylinder was a paper shell
coated with hard wax, and therefore
could be removed without destroying the
voice impression. These changes made
possible the first steps in the commercial
development of recording machines.
It was in 1887 that the first grama-
phone appeared on the market. It had
taken nine years for the phonograph to
reach this rudimentary stage of commer-
cial exploitation. The Columbia Company
was formed to sell Edison's phonograph

of duplicating records was still present
and artists still slaved night and day to
meet demands for "one at a time" rec-
ords. The manufacture of records became
a small industry all its own, and business
increased.
But there were still a number of fun-
damental advances to be made before the
phonograph could reach a mature form.
About the time the Bell-Tainter grama-
phone came on the market a young
German-American named Emile Berliner
began to experiment with some of his
ideas on reproducing sound. The Bell-
Tainter and Edison inventions both re-
corded sound by revolving cylinders, and
both made use of vertical grooves on
which to store the sound. Berliner was
convinced that a groove which waivered
from side to side at an even depth would
give improved reproduction. He also
proposed that the grooves be run in a
spirial on a disc rather than a cylinder.
A third idea of Berliners was that instead
of embossing, (Edison's patent) or
gouging (Bell-Tainter controlled) the
impressions, the grooves be created by
etching with acid.
It took Berliner a long time to solve
the problems of these ideas. Some that
might seem trivial were almost impossible
to solve. The type of fat or compound
to be coated on the zinc, and the thick-
ness of this coating which would insure
sharp, clear grooves after etching, were
important questions. The fact that no
research of this type had ever been car-
ried out before did not help the situation
any. Without previous records Berliner
had to carry on the "hit and miss" type
of experiments, with the hope of striking
on the right combination.
Persistent as any scientist is, Berliner
solved these problems, and managed to
record and reproduce sound on his new
flat disc. He officially demonstrated his
invention in Philadelphia on May 16,
1888, a day almost as important to the
phonograph as the day of the first record-
ed sound by Edison. The etched surface
gave a desirable and better method of
producing sound. The flat disc allowed
the stylus to follow the record grooves,
thereby abolishing the necessity for the
screw arrangement required in the Edison
and Bell-Tainter machines. Berliner's
system was good, and soon he was doing
a brisk business selling recording ma-
chines and making recording discs.
Berliner, however, was not through
with his experiments. The problem of
duplicating records was still present, and
perplexing the recording industry. Ber-
liner was determined to solve the prob-
lem, and after three or four years of
hard work, found a process which is still
used today. The original recording disc
was first coated with copper and nickel
which, when split off, made a negative
record which had ridges for its grooves,
This record, when suitably mounted and
stiffened, could be used to stamp out
duplicate records in heated material.
Even this process was plagued with
some problems. When first attempted it
was found that no substance known was
suitable for pressing into records. Hard
rubber could not be heated high enough,
and would not take a complete impression
at lower temperatures. Celluloid (the
first man made plastic) was tested, but
did not fill the requirements. Finally, by
some quirk of fate, Berliner heard of a
plastic compound used by a button manu-
facturer. He went to the manufacturer,
and convinced him to press two discs
for a test. These discs were a complete
success, and the "Durenoid" material was
essentially the shellac of all the billions
of records in many years to come.
The last problem facing Berliner was
that of a constant speed motor to drive
his phonograph. The mass production of
records was useless if the speed of re-
cording could not be standardized. The
solution was another semi-accident. One
day Fred Gaisberg read an advertisement
for a clockwork sewing machine motor.
He went to the manufacturer and ordered
a phonograph motor designed and built.
The motor was a complete flop. Another
stroke of fate struck, for one of the tech-

nicians, named Eldridge Johnson, who
worked on the motor became interested
in the problem, and, after some time,
saw the required changes in the original
motor.
With Johnson's motor, Berliner's
gramaphone was at last a commercial
proposition. Side to side spiral grooves,
flat disc, etched zinc electroplated matrix,
and shellac duplicating pressing made
the system complete. Eldridge Johnson
stayed on with Berliner, and took charge
of gramaphone production at Camden,
New Jersey. A few years later he started

From this period to the present the
phonograph has increased in popularity.
The coming of electricity with its motors,
vacuum tubes, and tuning systems, has
turned the phonograph into one of our
more important entertainment media. It
must still be kept in mind, however, that
the phonograph would have been impos-
ible without the pioneering experiments

MICROWAVE RESEARCH
The expanding role of electronic equipment in
modern military operations has given high pri-
ority to microwave research. No field today offers
greater challenge to the scientist and engineer.
In support of current electronic countermeas-
ures programs and in anticipation of future
systems requirements, Ramo-Wooldridge Divi-
sion is engaged in microwave research to develop
new techniques and to refine conventional com-
ponents.
Research is under way at Ramo-Wooldridge
for new methods and new designs to reduce sub-
stantially the over-all size, weight and complexity
of electronic equipment for both airborne and
ground-based uses.
For example, the low-loss delay line in the
photograph above was designed, developed and
manufactured by Ramo-Wooldridge for use in
airborne equipment. Packaged for use in the
system for which it was designed, this miniature
ceramic unit weighs less than two pounds. It re-
places a component which weighed more than
twenty pounds and occupied more than five
times as much volume.
Special opportunities exist for those with
qualified experience in microwave research—in
technique evaluation, component development,
and design of such systems equipment—at
Ramo - Wooldridge.

(Continued from page 21)
reserves is an important consideration for
any industry now using gas, as well as for
any contemplating its use. Gas is much
cheaper at the field than after transpor-
tation, despite the relatively low cost
of pipeline transmission. Gas is not
available in many locations, and even
those locations which are served by
pipelines may not have sufficient reserve
capacity to allow an industrial user of
any size to tap into the line. Local com-
panies must be consulted by potential
gas users to determine availability, rates,
and reliability of supply. Many factories
in the midwest have been forced to shut
down when nearby gas wells were ex-
hausted.
Oil is available along pipelines and
major waterways at rates only slightly
higher than at the well. It is presently
the most expensive fuel in many areas,
and the long-range outlook for oil pro-
duction is uncertain at best. The govern-
ment is promoting the use of fuels other
than oil for industrial use due to the
fixed demands for oil by automotive and
chemical users.
In analyzing fuel costs for any location,
do not overlook the possibility of using
a different fuel than employed at other
plants, should the customary fuel be
relatively expensive at an otherwise
attractive location.
Electric Power Costs
Electric power, like fuel, is an extreme-
ly heavy factor in determining the most
economical location for a plant. Many of
the new industrial areas of the future will
be developed for no other reason than
that they offer a tremendous amount of
cheap electricity. The Tennessee Valley
Authority has been largely responsible
for creating an industrial belt in Tennes-
see and northern Alabama. The great
Kitimat aluminum plant in British Co-
lumbia, far from transportation and labor,
was built because hydroelectric power
could be tapped. Generally, electric rates
are lower where a large part of the
power is generated hydroelectrically, and
highest where fuel must be shipped over
long distances. Electric power rates,
roughly speaking, are lowest on the
Pacific coast, and near TVA. Rates are
highest in New England, the Dakotas,
and Florida. Throughout the rest of the
country rate variations are not great.
Rates within one state are usually very
close.
In some areas, however, a heavy user
could not get sufficient power for his
needs at any rate, due to shortages. Most
of the capacity of the low-rate areas has
already been snapped up by power-
hungry industry. Many big power users
have had to locate in the hinterlands in
order to satisfy their electrical needs.
Land itself is of form of natural re-
sources used by every industry, and like
everything else, it costs money to use it.
Usually several tracts of land are avail-
able near any community; the decision
of which to build on, wholly aside from
civil engineering considerations, depends
on proximity to rail facilities, highways,
power lines, and other utilities. These
factors are fairly obvious, once the com-
munity for the new plant is finally decid-
ed upon. The sites that any one com-
munity offers will often be a factor in
selecting the community, however, and
this is not so obvious. Many industries
have special land requirements dictated
by secrecy, dangerous operations, noise,
parking, and material stockpiling. Not
every community can offer a site that
will meet these needs, even when the
community seems ideally suited other-
wise. Each firm should decide whether
it has special needs such as these early
in its search.
Water Important
Water is an important and critical
natural resource, needed in unusually-
large quantities by many types of indus-
try. Some industries need be little con-
cerned by water supply, but the chem-
ical, metallurgical, rubber and brewing
industries, among others, need huge
quantities. It takes 600,000 gallons of
water to produce a ton of synthetic hub-
ber, and 65,000 gallons to produce a
ton of steel. Such industries ordinarily
must locate on a large body of fresh water,
such as a lake or major river, and most
pump and treat their own water. Plan-
ners for such industries are aware of
their special needs and will not consider
a site that does not have adequate water
supply. Another important consideration
of water supply is the hardness of the
water. Water used for cooling or wash-
ing seldom needs special treatment, but
that used in boilers and in chemical re-
actions must be relatively pure. Any
industry requiring pure water must deter-
mine the cost of purifying their water
supply and add this to the delivery cost.
In some areas industrial water is
drawn from wells. Before locating in
such areas, data on water-table levels over
several years must be studied to determine
whether an adequate supply seems as-
sured. Even where surface water is
supplied, shortages may occur, making it
advisable to secure evidence of sufficient
supply in all seasons.
Industries intending to pump their
own water from wells or from surface
bodies on which they might locate
should first determine whether local
water-conservation restrictions will per-
mit this practice.
Disposal Problem
Akin to water supply is the problem
of waste disposal. Each industry is aware
of its peculiar waste-disposal problems,
and will be able to evaluate a site in
terms of its needs. However, when mov-
ing a factory into a region hitherto not
industrialized, greater precautions some-
times must be taken to avoid stream con-
tamination, air pollution, and other such
problems which may cause considerable
friction in a community and which might
be violations of the law.
Mineral resources have not played such
48
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


dustries in America as might be expected.
The finished product is frequently pro-
duced at a great distance from the mine.
Many metal ores are concentrated at the
mine and shipped elsewhere to be refined.
Sometimes this has been a result of the
greater economies of being near fuel
than raw material, as in the case of the
steel industry. Often mines are in moun-
tainous or unpopulated areas, such as the
copper mines of Nevada, Arizona and
Michigan, or the lead-silver mines in
Colorado. Freight rates on finished goods
are much higher than on bulk commodi-
ties, making it cheaper to manufacture
near markets. Also, the sources of metals
have shifted as mines played out, and
metalworking industries have not found
it economical to follow them. As a re-
sult, it is frequent practice to transport
raw materials in bulk to a location where
other factors are most favorable.
In locating a new plant, one must
decide whether to transport raw materials
or finished products. Raw materials will
likely be transported in bulk along a
single transportation route from a single
source, requiring a heavy-duty, one direc-
tion transport system, such as a freighter
line, pipeline, or heavy-duty rail line.
However, distribution of a finished prod-
uct generally requires radial transport
routes reaching all parts of the nation.
The subject of raw materials cannot be
judged adequately as a factor in plant
location without a thorough study of
transportation, which will now be con-
sidered.
Transportation
Transportation is naturally a key factor
in locating an industry at a given point
on the map, for transportation makes it
possible to move goods and materials to
and from that point and any other point
on the map. Transportation influences
many of the other factors previously con-
sidered; water, electric power, any man's
labor, fuel, minerals, and even markets
would be at the doorstep of any factory
anywhere if these things could all be
transported there efficiently.
The railroads form the basic industrial
transportation system in the U. S. Nearly
every industry depends directly upon rail-
road transportation in some form, either
carload service at its own siding, less-
than-carload service, or Railway Express.
The cost of railway transportation per
100 pounds between any two given
points varies for different classes of com-
modities, the highest rates being for
light, bulky objects of relatively high
value, the lowest being for heavy, com-
pact objects of relatively low value. For
example, coal is carried for much less
per 100 pounds than lampshades. In
addition, the rate per 100 pounds of a
given commodity varies for each combin-
ation of terminal cities, often irrespective
of distance between them. The strange
system usually results in lower, not
higher, rates, as in the days of railroad
trusts, although it may be just as baffling
to the shipper. It makes things even
tougher for the industrial geographer,
since he can't draw circles with a com-
pass on a map to find points of equal
freight cost. Usually one must decide
which will be the several most important
commodities shipped to and from a cer-
tain plant, and locate in general the areas
where the sum of the costs for shipping
these items will be least. If three raw
materials are used in approximately equal

quantities by a plant, find the sum of the
rates for a station near the center of the
triangle formed by the sources of supply.
Then sum the rates for stations slightly
closer to each of the three sources. De-
termine the line along which the sum
falls most rapidly. The station which
offers a minimum sum can then be lo-
cated easily. With luck, perhaps a suit-
able location may be found nearby.
Along the line of a given railroad, or in
a given area, rate gradations are usually
negligible.
Motor Freight Used
Many industries depend on motor
freight, either common carrier or com-
pany-owned vehicles. In the case of the
former, rate structures are not unlike rail-
road rates. Company-owned transporta-
tion cost are more closely tied to distance.
Capacity and quality of highways may
be a critical factor, particularly in remote
or rural areas. The highway system, be-
ing more far-reaching than the railroad
network, reaches almost any potential in-
dustrial site. Industries requiring rail
sidings must obviously locate along a rail
line.
Water transport is cheaper for bulk
commodities than any other form. Heavy
industry that can utilize this form of
transportation must investigate sites
directly on navigable bodies of water,
preferably those affording direct access
to the port of origin of the commodity
to be transported. Adequate port and
docking facilities, as well as attendant
loading and dumping devices, must be
available.
Industries that will utilize oil or gas
must locate at some point along the pipe-
lines carrying these products. Mere
presence of a line does not imply that
it is tapped at a given point, however.
Pipelines operate "straight through" un-
less there is sufficient demand to warrant
a tap and a distribution system to the
trunk pipeline.
Air transportation of freight is of
minor importance to most industries;
however, some, such as drug manufac-
turers, may find themselves frequent
enough users of this very fast service
to warrant locating near an airport where
air freight service is offered in a number
of directions.
Industries which also distribute their
final product to the nation as a whole,
rather than to other industries or dis-
tributors, have special transportation
needs. For example, the large mail-order
houses are located in Chicago, near the
center of population of the U. S. and

highway routes diverging to all points.
This problem brings us to markets, which
have some effect on the location of in-
dustries, particularly those which sell
directly to the public, or to a large num-
ber of other firms.
The first firms to decentralize were
those that must maintain close contact
with a diverse market. They found that
by shipping finished products from sev-
eral plants in widely separated parts of
the country, transportation costs and time
gave them an advantage over competitors
who operated from a single location.
Other firms found that as the nation's
center of population moved west, so did
its center of spending. Branch plants
became necessary to serve an expanding
nation, particularly in industries whose
products did not lend themselves well
to economical long-distance transporta-
tion. One wire mill might serve the
nation, or at least a state, but ice cream
plants had to be closely spaced.
Civil Defense Factor
Decentralization has always been fa-
vored by the Pentagon as the easiest way
to protect our war-production capacity
from mass bomber attack. Since the in-
vention of nuclear bombs and missiles,
decentralization has become even more
urgent. The Office of Defense Mobiliz-
ation has even threatened to cancel con-
tracts for military aircraft held by certain
large West-Coast firms if they did not
agree to locate new plants in less heavily-
industrialized areas.
Too much of too many vital industries
is too close to ground zero. While there
is no need to hide factories in the woods,
the interests of the safety of the nation
demand that new plants of strategic in-
dustries be located where they ;ire rela-
tively safe.
Another area worthy of consideration
in locating a state or municipality are
the laws regulating industry in that state,
particularly as they relate to taxes. Most
states have some sort of tax on the
profits of industrial firms, but there is
a great deal of difference in the level
of these taxes. Some states will offer
special tax reductions to new industries;
many other inducements and exemptions
are offered. Many of these might be in-
fluential in deciding where to locate a
plant, but one can but wonder what is
wrong with a state industrially if it has
to dole out special dispensations in order
to lure industry.
Some communities run counter to the
trend of seeking new industry. Residen-
tial and conservative agricultural com-
munities often would rather not have
industries locating nearby. Zoning laws
and community character are easily dis-
covered on first seeking a site in such a
community, however.
Climate is in some degree a factor in
industrial location. A few industries are
eminently unsuited for any but special
climate conditions. Aside from these,
climate has effects on labor efficiency,
heating costs (or cooling costs!), and
market conditions. Smog is an example
of ill effects resulting from poor coopera-
tion between industry and climatological
conditions.
One final requirement that must be
met before a plant site can be deemed
suitable is that of a supply of manage-
ment. Will it be necessary to relocate
salaried employees? They are often much
more difficult to find locally than laborers,
especially if the new plant moves into
a non-industrial area.
Final Problem
This final requirement leads to an in-
teresting problem that has grown out of
decentralization: Shall management be
regionalized, or remain on a departmental
basis? Each method of management has
its own advantages (Russia recently de-
cided to switch to the regional rather
than departmental type of control).
For smaller companies the depart-
mental system has advantages. It allows
specialists to use their abilities to the
maximum. It gives a unity of policy and
control. It is usually cheaper. For a
very large organization, however, the
regional system has advantages. It pro-
vides a responsible and inclusive author-
ity not too far from the problem. It
trains lower officers in more fields, thus
preparing them for top positions. It
permits comparing statistics on the oper-
ation of each division to help spot the
more profitable and less profitable enter-
prises. The esprit de corps of each re-
gion is improved if it is more or less on
its own and expected to prove itself.
Location of industries by anything
aproaching precise scientific methods has
only recently become widespread. Indus-
trial geography promises to become an
important special field within the engi-
neering profession. It involves an excel-
lent knowledge of the requirements of
the industry, of transportation systems
and tariffs, and of economic geography—
and entails great responsibility.

than just the size of the FISH
and the size of the POND
O
We've been told that an engineering graduate is frequently attracted to
companies our size because of his understandable human desire to be "a big
fish in a little pond".
While it is true that (numerically speaking) our employee team is small
compared to some, we encounter great difficulty in trying to think of Sikorsky
Aircraft as a "little pond". Our contributions to the field of rotary-winged
aircraft have not been small, nor can our field be considered limited or pro-
fessionally confining. Quite the contrary. Sikorsky Aircraft is the company
which pioneered the modern helicopter; and our field today is recognized as

AIR CONDITIONING, REFRIGERATION, HEATING
and HEAT TRANSFER PRODUCTS

*lnner-fin tube has on
"R" factor (internal
coefficient) of 5.05.
This spirally wound sur-
face is an excellent tur-
bulence promoter. It
positively prevents
channeling and has the
highest value of overall
heat transfer coeffi-
cient of all types of
heat transfer coils.
Inner fin is the patented Dunham-Bush
development which has revolutionized the
design of heat transfer equipment. It has
introduced a basic new concept of heat
transfer engineering, permitting units of
smaller, lighter construction.
Engineering developments such as inner-fin
tubing are commonplace at Dunham-Bush
. . . where progress in heating, air condi-
tioning, refrigeration and specialized heat
transfer products is an everyday occurrence.

made the distance seem to be less than
one yard.
Once beneath the surface, the two men
observed the change in color of the
water due to absorbtion of respective
wavelengths of light.
Observed by spectroscope, red was
completely absorbed at 50 feet, orange
at 150 feet. At 300 feet the whole spec-
trum was dimmed and yellow almost
gone. From there to 450 feet, the water
turned a deep blue of surprising brill-
iance. This mind-penetrating blue brill-
iance was always one of the features of
the dives.
A searchlight was carried in the sec-
ond window in later dives. While it had
no effect at 600 feet, a brilliant yellow
swath was cut through the water at 1050
feet. The beam was always sharp and
distinct due to the clarity of the water.
The primary purpose of the dives was
to observe underwater sea life, not to
set records as to depth. But it was ine-
vitable that the bathysphere should set
depth records because the previous depth
record was 565 feet. During the eighth
dive the bathysphere reached the depth
of 1400 feet, more than a quarter mile,
carrying the flags of the Explorers' Club
and the New York Zoological Society
on the outside of the sphere.
At this depth the pressure against the
hull was tremendous. With six hundred
and fifty pounds pushing on every square
inch, the total pressure on the hull was
3366 tons!
The last four dives of 1930 were
contour dives. This practice involved
bringing the bathysphere close to shore
and slowly towing it out to sea over the
bottom. Commands to raise or lower it
a few feet at a time were rapidly exe-
cuted, so only one close contact with a
coral reef was experienced. Much of the
underwater Bermuda glacial beach was
mapped this way.
The Observation Dives of 1932
The next series of dives was conducted
in 1932. The bathysphere, now soiled
with oil grease stains, was painted a
deep marine blue. The electric cable was

re-installed, and the sphere was ready
for test dives. The party decided to try
and install a spare quartz window in
the third port. Since exact knowledge of
installation was lacking, the port was not
successfully closed on two dives. Both
times, first with the quartz window and
then with the steel plug, the sphere re-
turned to the surface full of water under
tremendous pressure. The air in the
bathysphere had been forced into a bare
fraction of its former volume and thus
pressurized the water.
The wing nut was slowly turned out,
but both times the tremendous pressure
hurled it at the winch, making two large
dents in the winch handle. The water
immediately spurted out and turned to a
fine mist as the dissolved air exploded
out.
The steel plate was again repacked,
but this time the crew brought as much
pressure as possible against the window
nuts. The bathysphere was again sent
down and came up free of water.
On September 22nd the first dive of
the season was made. The National
Broadcasting Company had set a trans-
mitter up in the barge and was ready to
broadcast the dive across the country
from Bermuda. The transmission con-
sisted of a half hour of preparation
description and a half hour of Beebe's
spontaneous observations.
This dive was made during a heavy
swelling of the ocean, and later in the
dive the barge began to pitch. This was
transmitted directly down the cable to
the bathysphere, so Beebe and Barton
decided to come up from 2200 feet.
After more dives of observation the
bathysphere was retired to the Century of
Progress Exposition in Chicago and the
expedition disbanded.
Final Dives of the Bathysphere
After a year of remaining in public
view, the bathysphere was called to its
final service by the National Geographic
Society. Beebe and Barton agreed to the
final series of dives. Once more the crew
and all equipment assembled in Bermuda
and waited for the arrival of the bathy-
sphere. For this set of dives the bathy-
sphere was completely refitted with
modern equipment, only the steel sphere
itself remaining the same. Some inno-
vations were a small blower to pass the
air over the chemicals, a stronger search-
light, and three new quartz windows.
With the usual test dives past, the
bathysphere was ready on August 7,
1934. The next two manned dives were
routine as far as observation goes, but
on the second dive the bathysphere
reached the record depth of 3000 feet.
The record caused a slight celebration up
on the barge, but the primary purpose of
the expedition remained, as always, to
study undersea life.
After a few more dives, the bathy-
sphere was permanently retired from
service and placed on public display.
Altogether the sphere had made some
forty dives down into the ocean and had
never failed in use.
Future Bathyspheres
At this date the bathysphere has been
superceedcd by a deep sea craft which
is independent of any surface control
during a dive. This craft, the Trieste,
consists of a large metal float with the
observation gondola suspended beneath.
The Trieste*s float is filled with lighter-
than-water gasoline which, when par-
tially released, causes the craft to sink.
To surface, the craft releases many tons
of steel shot which it carries. Thus it
can rise or sink at will.
The Trieste has a motor and power for
one hundred feet of foreward travel. A
lack of foreward motion was one fault
of the bathysphere.
The Trieste has sunk to the fantastic
depth of 20,000 feet off of the coast
of France and Italy, where the pressure
reached 600 atmospheres!
The dives of the Trieste have been
sponsored by the United States Office of
Naval Research, and under its support,
a new craft is being built to go deeper
than 20,000 feet.
The bathysphere was the first of the
truly deep sea diving vessels. Although
only a steel ball on the end of a long
steel cable, it permitted a great advance-
ment to take place in deep sea knowledge.
It now takes its well deserved rest and
serves as a curiosty to man. But Beebe
and Barton probably will never forget
the sight of the myriad luminous dots in
the darkness of the sea.

Two duck hunters were sitting behind
their blind, one drinking from a thermos
of coffee, the other from a jug of whis-
key. After some hours of sipping they
spotted a lone duck winging through the
sky. Taking quick aim, the coffee drinker
rose, let fire, and missed. The whiskey
drinker rose, let fire, and brought the
duck down. His companion, properly
amazed, complimented him on the shot.
He replied, "Aw, it's nothing. I usually

Probably the reason that God made
woman last was that he didn't want any
advice while creating man.
Seems that a wife, who was dearly
loved by her husband, died. This devoted
husband believed in cremation. After
which he placed the ashes in a vase.
Wishing to display his love for his de-
parted mate by having her ashes near
him, he placed the vase on his study
desk.
After a while, as is the human habit,
he more or less forgot her "presence"
and became quite careless with his cigar
ashes by using the vase for an ash tray.
One evening, a friend who knew the
departed well, was visiting the widower,
and casually glanced into the vase.
"Ah," he said, "I notice your wife
has put on a little weight."

The colonel was lecturing a class of
ROTC students.
"A 40-foot flagpole has fallen down,"
he said. "You have a sergeant and a

The students thought, then made sug-
gestions about block and tackle, derricks

"You're all wrong," said the colonel.
"You'd say, 'Sergeant, get the flagpole

STRAIGHT TALK TO ENGINEERS
from Donald W. Douglas, Jr.
President, Douglas Aircraft Company
The "Space Age" isn't going to become a fact
by itself. We engineers have to make it happen.
Here's what Douglas is doing about it:
We've formed a top level engineering council
to bring all our knowledge and experience to
bear on the new problems relating to extreme
high speeds and altitudes and to outer space.
This council is composed of the bonds; of our six
major engineering divisions and is chairmanned
by our senior engineering vice president. It will
map out the most important goals in aviation and
mobilize the scientific and engineering resources
required to achieve them.
If you would like to become a part of our stim-
ulating future, we'll welcome hearing from you.

THE ULTIMATE DEFENSE
Knowledge is the ultimate defense if kept free to repel
the evils that besiege mankind. To give knowledge the time to win,
it must be protected—on its outer perimeter by weapons.
Weapons are created with knowledge, built with know-how, and produced
in quantity with technical skills. Foremost in Grumman's plans for the future
are men who have the imagination to create and the insight to solve.

(Continued from page 17)
in the concert-hall, each ear must hear a
different sound so that the illusions of
depth and direction are achieved. This is
the basic concept of sterophonic sound.
The earliest attempts at this were
known as binaural reproductions. A re-
cording contained two sets of grooves,
one on the inside of the record and one
on the outside. Thus two pickups were
required. Both were mounted on the same
arm and the resultant separate signals
were amplified individually and converted
to mechanical vibrations by special ear-
phones. One electrical signal went to each
earpiece. Generally, this was not too suc-
cessful. Each record could only contain
one half as much music, earphones were
required, and as the head was turned,
the orchestra seemed to move around the
room. After brief attempts to perfect
this system, it was abandoned.
Already Popular
Following this came the system in use
today. Promising to be very successful, it
is already immensely popular. By careful
engineering, the audio equipment manu-
facturers have been able to devise a rec-
ord that contains the two channels for
stereo in a single groove. To accompany
such a record, cartridges have been de-
veloped to convert the stylus movement
into two separate electrical waves. Then,
just as in binaural reproduction, each
signal is amplified separately. However,
earphones are not necessary. The record-
ings are made in such a way that if two
speakers are used, and they are placed
properly, the sound waves in the air will
reach the ear very much like those in
the concert-hall. In this way, sterophonic
sound has developed and is now ready
for home use.
A first look at stereo might lead the
reader to believe that purchasing the new
outfit will cost twice as much as mon-
aural. Actually, this is not so. Although
two amplifiers and speakers are required,
only one turntable, tone arm, and car-
tridge assembly is necessary. And the two
amplifiers can be of smaller power ca-
pacity than one monaural amplifier.
Finally, a saving can be made due to the
fact that the low tones contribute very
little to the stereo effect if they are
separately reproduced. Thus only one
low range speaker is required.
Those who already have monaural high
fidelity equipment should not be afraid
that their equipment is obsolete. It is
felt that for good stereo sound, one
should use a transcription quality turn-
table and arm instead of a changer. How-
ever, some newer cartridges are claimed
to be well-enough designed so that any-
one who already has an automatic changer
may not need to purchase a turntable.
Only a second speaker and amplifier are
then necessary.
According to trends in the hi-fi market,
with the consumers buying madly and the
producers trying to keep up with the
demand, it is certain that stereo is no
longer a gadget or pipe dream. Highly
developed and readily available, stereo
is a new electronic wonder for everyone
to enjoy.

talked to themselves, tapped their cuffs
together, or explored the cubicle with
restless random movements. In the later
stages of the experiment, vivid and
weird hallucinations were produced. One
subject reported seeing a procession of
squirrels with sacks over their shoulders,
walking across a snow field. Changes in
the subjects' brain waves have been noted,
similar to the disorganization produced
by drugs or lesions. It was difficult to
keep the subjects under confinement for
more than two or three days, despite a
high rate of pay.
Evidently, the man's task in the space
ship must be kept novel and interesting
to avoid these bizarre effects of confine-
ment. The Human Engineer must provide
a work environment neither so demand-
ing as to cause irritation and fatigue,
nor so simple as to result in feelings of
solitariness and boredom.
A reasonable question which may be
asked is: "Why is the man required in
the space ship in the first place? Could
he not be replaced by machinery which
would do the job better?"
The man, of course, is uniquely able
to report the interesting human reactions
to space travel. But beyond this purpose,
the man has very valuable abilities for
sensing and processing information, and
for decision making. It has been calcu-
lated that the best equipment available
for duplicating man's space functions
would weigh at least a thousand times
as much as the man. Such equipment
would probably be too complicated to be
reliable. Nor could it fully duplicate
man's ability to make decisions. It has
been said of the human, that: "nowhere
else can you obtain a self-maintaining
computer with built-in judgment which
can be mass produced by unskilled labor."
The Human Engineer must insure that
these abilities are used to best advantage.

than the bottle.
2. Exactly 111 1/9 pounds.

6. The cube of 642 is 264609288, the
cube of 641 is 263374721, and so
the difference is 1,234,567. The
method used is as follows:
P3 - Q1 = 1234567
(P - Q) (P2 + Q2 + PQ) r--
1234567
Let P - Q = 1 then P = Q + 1
or 3Q2 + 3Q + 1 = 1234567
3Q2 + 3Q - 1234566 = 0
Q2 + Q - 411522 = 0
This must be the product of two num-

welds were made with a 15,000,000-
volt betatron. Every bit of the
special steel, every weld had to be
proved sound and flawless.
Combustion Engineering designed and built this "couldn't-
be-done'' reactor vessel for America's first full-scale
nuclear power station. And photography shared the job of
testing metals, revealing stresses and proving soundness.
Countless unusual—even unique-
problems faced Combustion
Engineering in creating this nuclear
reactor vessel. Nine feet in diameter
with walls 8V2 in. thick, it is 235 tons
of steel that had to be flawless,
seamed with welds that had to be
perfect. And the inner, ultrasmooth
surface was machined to dimension
with tolerances that vie with those
in modern aircraft engines.
As in all its construction. Combus-
tion Engineering made use of
photography all along the way. Pho-
tography saved time in the drafting
rooms. It revealed where stresses
and strains would be concentrated.
It checked the molecular structure
of the steel, showed its chemical
make-up. And with gamma rays it
probed for flaws in the metal, imper-
fections in the welds.
Any business, large or small, can
use photography in many ways to
save time and money. It can go to
work in even' department—design,
research, production, personnel,
sales, and accounting.

Teaching—
A Career Opportunity
For the Engineer
Leading educators, statesmen and in-
dustrialists throughout the country are
greatly concerned with the current
shortage of high-caliber graduates who
are seriously considering a career in the
field of science or engineering educa-
tion. Consequently, General Electric has
taken this opportunity to explore, with
one of America's eminent educators, the
opportunities and rewards teaching of-
fers the scientific or engineering student.
Q. Is there in fact a current and con-
tinuing need for educators in technical
colleges and universities?
A. Colleges and universities providing
scientific and engineering educational
opportunities are hard pressed at the
present moment to obtain the services
of a sufficient number of well-qualified
teachers to adequately carry out their
programs. Projected statistical studies
show that this critical need could ex-
tend over the next 15 or 20 years.
Q. Why is this need not being met?
A. There are probably three main rea-
sons. These might be classed under con-
ditions of financial return, prestige as-
sociated with the position, and lack
of knowledge and understanding on the
part of the college student of the ad-
vantages and rewards teaching as a
career can afford.
Q. What steps have been taken to make
education a more attractive field to en-
gineering students?
A. Steps are being taken in all areas.
For example, we have seen a great deal
in the newspapers relating educators'
salaries to the importance of the job
they are doing. Indications are that
these efforts are beginning to bear fruit.
Greater professional stature is being
achieved as the general public under-
stands that the youth of our nation is
the most valuable natural resource that
we possess ... and that those associated
with the education of this youth have
one of the most important assignments
in our country today.
Q. Aside from salary, what rewards can
a career in education offer as opposed
to careers in government or industry?
A. The principal rewards might be free-
dom to pursue your own ideas within
the general framework of the school, in
teaching, research and consulting activ-
ities. As colleges and universities are
normally organized, a man has three
months in the summer time to engage
in activities of his own choice. In addi-
tion, the educator is in direct contact
with students and he has the satisfac-
tion of seeing these students develop
under his direction ... to see them take
important positions in local and na-
tional affairs.
Q. What preparation should an en-
gineering student undertake for a teach-
ing career?
A. In college, the engineering student
should obtain a basic understanding of
science, engineering science, humanities
and social sciences with some applica-
tions in one or more professional en-
gineering areas. He should have fre-
quent career discussions with faculty
members and his dean. During graduate
work, a desirable activity, the student
should have an opportunity to do some
teaching.
Q. Must an engineering student obtain
advanced degrees before he can teach?
A. It is not absolutely necessary. On the
other hand, without advanced degrees,
advancement in the academic world
would be extremely difficult.
O. How valuable do you feel industrial
experience is to an engineering or scien-
tific educator?
A. Industrial experience for a science



educator is desirable; however, with a
senior engineering educator, industrial
experience is a "must". An ideal en-
gineering educator should have had
enough industrial experience so that he
understands the problems and responsi-
bilities in carrying a project from its
formative stages to successful comple-
tion, including not only the technical
aspects, but the economic and personal
relationships also.
Q. What do you consider to be the op-
timum method by which an educator can
obtain industrial experience?
A. There are many methods. After
completion of graduate school, perhaps
the most beneficial is a limited but in-
tensive work period in industry. Con-
sulting during an academic year or
summer is a helpful activity and is
desirable for older members of the
staff. Younger educators usually need
experience in "living with the job"
rather than providing consultant's ad-
vice to the responsible individual.
Q. Based on your experience, what per-
sonal characteristics are possessed by
successful professors?
A. Primarily, successful professors have
an excellent and growing knowledge of
their subjects, are interested in people,
and transmit enthusiasm. They have an
ability to explain and impart informa-
tion with ease. They generate ideas and
carry them out because they are de-
voted to developing their fields of
knowledge. They desire personal free-
dom and action.

career opportunities in the field of
science and engineering education, write

tion, University of Illinois, Urbana, III.

Diversification of effort makes for versatility—and ver-
satility pays off in business as well as on the athletic
field. We've found that to be especially true here at Koppcrs.
Koppers is a widely diversified company—actively en-
gaged in the research and production of a wide range of re-
lated and seemingly unrelated products, such as remarkable
new plastics, jet-engine sound control, wood preservatives,
steel mill processes, dyestuffs, electrostatic precipitators, coal
tar chemicals, anti-oxidants and innumerable others.
Because we are diversified, our work is interesting. Through
a system of lateral movement, our engineers and manage-
ment personnel are given the opportunity to learn many of
the diverse operations at Koppers. The result? Versatility.
While you are moving laterally at Koppers, you are also
moving up. Your responsibilities are increased. Your ability
is evaluated and re-evaluated. And you are compensated
accordingly.
You don't have to be with Koppers for 20 years before you
get somewhere. If you have ability, ideas, spark—you'll move
ahead, regardless of seniority or tenure.
At Koppers, you'll stand on your own two feet. You'll get
responsibility, but you'll also have free rein to do the job the
way you think it should be done. No one will get in your way.
Koppers is a well-established company—a leader in many
fields. Yet, it's a forward-looking company, a young man's
company. Perhaps, your company.
Why not find out? Write to the Manager of Manpower
Planning, Koppcrs Company, Inc., Pittsburgh 19, Pennsyl-

hand, spearheading a technological development or improvement and on the
other, explaining in non-technical terms the significance of the work. The first
calls strenuously upon his technical ability and knowledge, quite often in a
field other than that in which he was trained (a survey has revealed that some
83 percent of engineers in industry were working in fields other than those in
which they had been educated). He must have a strong grasp of the basic
fundamentals of engineering and science, especially mathematics. For with
these, he has the foundation upon which to build new knowledge, knowledge
that cannot possibly be accumulated while in college.
Secondly, he must have the ability to discuss the project clearly and con-
cisely, both verbally and in writing. This might concern a talk to a Chamber of
Commerce interested in a highway, bridge or dam project; it might be to a
board of directors; or, in these days of missiles and satellites, it might be to a
group of newsmen. Technical journals and projects reports as well call for a
command of understandable English.
Our society essentially is a technological one and requires an increasing
number of engineers and scientists motivated and dedicated to doing that
which has not been done before, and to improving our present technology.
These tasks will not be easy and will call for engineers who can work with
others as a team, and yet have the background and ability to be leaders when
the occasion demands.
In short, today's needs demand well-rounded engineers. Young men inter-
ested in engineering or those now enrolled in some field of engineering at the
college level must realize this. Others have already. Eighty percent of all
college-educated executives in industry are engineering graduates.

Why Lockheed-
Lockheed's leadership in aircraft is continuing in missiles. The Missile
Systems Division is one of the largest in the industry and its reputation
is attested hy the number of high-priority, long-term projects it holds:
the Polaris IRBM, Earth Satellite, Kingfisher (Q-5) and the X-7.
To carry out such complex projects, the frontiers of technology in all
areas must be expanded. Lockheed"s laboratories at Sunnyvale and
Palo Alto, California, provide the most advanced equipment for research
and development, including complete test facilities and one of the
most up-to-date computing centers in the nation. Employee benefits
are among the best in the industry.
For those who qualify and desire to continue their education, the
Graduate Study Program enables them to obtain M.S. or Ph.D degrees
at Stanford or the University of California, while employed in their
chosen fields at Lockheed.
Lockheed Missile Systems Division was recently honored at the first
National Missile Industry Conference as "the organization that
contributed most in the past year to the development of the art of
missiles and astronautics!'

WES YOUR FIRST JOB ASSIGNMENT
BENEFIT PROGRAM
MEANS ADDED INCOME
by A. F. Hartford, Jr.
DuPont personnel representative

Don't forget the "extras" of an em-
ployee benefit program when you com-
pare the job offers and salaries of
different companies. At Du Pont, these
extras mean added income that doesn't
always meet the eye. They include
life insurance, group hospitalization
and surgical coverage, accident and
health insurance, pension plan and
paid vacation.
In addition, the Company sponsors
a thrift plan. After two years of serv-
ice, for every dollar you invest in
U. S. Savings Bonds the Company sets
aside 25 cents for the purchase of
common stock in your name. Roughly,
60,000 of our employees are now par-
ticipating in this plan.
If you have specific questions on
DuPont benefits, just send them to
me. I'll be happy to try to answer
them. E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.

ing, Wilmington 98, Delaware.
PERSONALIZED TRAINING
RELATES TO POLICY OF
PROMOTION FROM WITHIN
Where do your interests lie? What
courses have you taken? What are
your special abilities? Du Pont tries
to match these factors with available
openings to determine your first as-
signment within the Company.
Once the assignment is made, the
Company helps you apply your knowl-
edge to a problem right away. You
learn by doing and by consulting with
your supervisor and others working
on various phases of the same project.
Your performance on the job is
evaluated periodically to assist you in
knowing where you stand in the eyes
of your management. And, as you
might guess, DuPont's personalized
training is closely related to its pro-
motion policy. Practically all promo-
tional opportunities are filled by ad-
vancement from within the Company.
It is especially important for the
college student to know that manage-
ment authority at DuPont is decentral-
ized through many departments into
small groups—small enough so that
the new man's capabilities can be
recognized. This type of organiza-
tion, plus the Company's steady
growth, produces many opportunities.

Francis Bacon...on studies
"To spend too much time in studies is sloth; to use
them too much for ornament is affectation; to make
judgment wholly by their rules is the humor of a
scholar. They perfect nature, and are perfected by
experience, for natural abilities are like natural
plants, that need pruning by study; and studies
themselves do give forth directions too much at
large, except they be bounded in by experience.
Crafty men contemn studies, simple men admire
them, and wise men use them, for they teach not
their own use; but that is a wisdom without them,
and above them, won by observation."

THERMOELECTRICITY
Electricity from a bonfire's heat or atomic ener-
gy without a moving part — it's all possible now
using the long known, but seldom applied,
principles of thermoelectricity.
by BARRY PEEBLES, '60 E
The direct conversion of heat into
electricity at elevated tempera-
tures— Hmm — perhaps a little
high sounding, but a new class of
thermoelectric materials capable
of this phenomenon is prepared
on a laboratory scale in this spec-
ial furnace at the Westinghouse
Research Laboratories.
Courtesy Westinghouse
Ever think of powering your TV set
by using the heat from a bonfire or
air-conditioning your home with a sim-
ple plug-in device that has no moving
part? These and many other applications
of thermoelectricity may soon become
commonplace as scientists the world over
diligently apply two principles that have
laid dormant in the minds of men for
nearly 100 years.
Prototypes Developed
Already these two principles—the See-
beck effect (creation of electricity from
heat) and the Peltier effect (heating or
cooling directly with electricity)— have
been utilized in the U.S. by Westing-
house Corp. to provide prototypes of
electronic bottle warmers (or coolers)
and a hostess cart containing a warm
and a cold compartment. Meanwhile,
Russian scientists have developed a kero-
sene lamp generator that is being used
to power radios in remote regions, a full
size refrigerator, and several small re-
frigerated holders and containers for use
in biological studies.
Of course, we have just touched the
surface of possible use for this electronic
marvel—thermoelectricity. Just a mom-
ent's thought suggests such things as
combination freezer-cookers, electric ther-
mos bottles, refrigerated mixing bowls,
photo developing trays, and cooled draw-
ers for vegetable storage.
The future uses are indeed bright but
a number of problems must first be con-
quered. Such things as the types of mater-
ials used, the thermal efficiency obtained,
and electrical conductivity are obstacles
that must be cleared. But before studying
problems and the efforts being made to
solve them, let us look first at the See-
beck and Peltier effects—their birth, slow
growth, and fiinally their rapid maturing.
Seebeck Effect
The Seebeck effect was discovered in
1821, only a year after Hans Christian
Oersted opened the door to electromag-
netism with his discovery that a magnetic
needle is deflected by currents flowing in
a nearby wire. Then came the report by
Thomas Johann Seebeck that a magnetic
needle also deflected when it is held
near a circuit consisting of two conduc-
tors and one of the conductors is heated.
To us it seems a logical step to say that
a current is flowing in this circuit also
and that it is probably caused by the
heating of one of the conductors.
But, alas, Seebeck did not arrive at this
conclusion. He though that a difference
in temperature was the cause of magnet-
ism and attempted to explain terrestial
magnetism on the basis of a temperature
difference between the Poles and the
Equator. Seebeck's friends at first wanted
to follow the "logical" path but See-
becks unyielding battle discouraged any
attempt to use the effect for creating
electric currents.
This was indeed a shame! It was later
proven that the materials Seebeck used
could transform heat to electricity with
an efficiency of 3%, which compared
quite favorably to the steam engines of
his day. However, at that time the steam
engine had not been utilized to provide
electric power so the Seebeck effect would

It may look like a new game, but actually it is a semiconductor. The white circles

have provided a good source to replace
the weak currents used in the laboratories
of that day. Had this effect been pursued
the whole future development of elec-
tromagnetism would have been altered.
Peltier Effect
A few years later the converse of the
Seebeck effect was discovered, but again
its full potential was not understood. In
1834 Jean Charles Athansase Peltier, a
watchmaker by trade, reported that a
thermal effect was associated with the
passing a current through a conductor
made of two different materials.
It is understandable to see why See-
beck and Peltier did not arrive at what
we call the "logical" conclusion. How-
ever, four years after Peltier's discovery
the marvel of thermoelectricity should
have become an established fact. At that
time Emil Lenz placed a drop of water
on the junction of the two conductors.
By running the current in one direction
he discovered that the water froze while
if he ran it in the other the ice melted.
Again, however, the impact of its poten-
tial use was not felt.
In the 1850's scientists, led by the
work of Lord Kelvin, began to appreciate
and understand the Seebeck and Peltier
effects but not until the 1930 s—over
100 years after Seebeck's discovery—
was any intense effort made to find prac-
tical applications of these effects. In this
country notable research on these effects
were undertaken by Lar O. Grondahl in
1928 and Dr. Maria Telkes in 1937, as
well as several others.
With the quantum theory as a foun-
dation, and aided by the work of these
early researchers, we are now able to ex-
plain basically what happens inside the
conductors to make the Seebeck and
Peltier effects possible. Although what
follows is indeed a simplified explana-
tion it should be sufficient to explain the
unseen action.
We all know that when one end of a
conductor is heated electrons tend to
flow towards the cold end, thus causing
it to become negatively charged. (Fig.
one). Since like charges repel each other
the cold end will soon impel the flow
of more electrons toward it. The result
is that soon an ecjuilbrium is reached.
Charges do not continue to accumulate
but a voltage difference between the hot
end and the cold end is still maintained.
It is this voltage difference that is the
important factor.
Semi-Conductors
Now a very interesting point arises.
A higher voltage difference can be
reached if their are fewer electrons avail-
able for the return flow in the conductor.
In other words, more electrons accumulate
at the cold end before an equilibrium
is reached. For this reason the materials
used in today's applications are not metals,
or "full" conductors, but semi-conductor
materials. Today much of the research in
thermoelectricity is being done in an
attempt to find better semi-conductor ma-
terials—a point we shall return to later.
One more basic advantage of semi-
conductors must be mentioned before we
show how this theory is actually applied
today. This advantage is that in certain
semi-conductors a voltage difference is
obtained not by the flow of electrons, but
by the flow of positive charged "holes"
vacated by the electrons. (Fig. two). The
result is that the hot end is negative while
the cold end is positive, exactly the oppo-
site of the other materials.
With this information it is now a
simple step to create electricity by use of
the Seebeck effect. If we join the hot
end of an "a-type" (hot end positive) to
the hot end of a "b-type" (hot end nega-
tive) we can cause a motor to operate
by connecting it to the cold ends and
thus completing the electric circuit. (Fig.
three). Of course, it is true that unless
heat is maintained at the hot ends the
flow of current would bring the two

By use of the Seebeck effect, it is possi-
ble to convert heat to electricity. Heat
applied to the ends of two different
types of semiconductors creates a volt-
age difference that can be utilized for
power generation.
Fig. 4
The Pelteir effect can be used by con-
stantly heating the left ends and apply-
ing current in the same direction. These
ends will become colder, absorbing heat
and cooling the surroundings.

Reversing the direction of the current

materials back to a "normal" electric
state.
From this example we can show how
the Peltier effect would be utilized to
cool an area. If we remember the
example above we realize that the
flow of current tended to cool the hot
ends and we continuously had to apply
more heat. Now if we were to feed elec-
tricity into the circuit in the same direc-
tion that it was flowing before we would
tend to cool down the hot ends while the
cold ends would heat up. If we keep
applying current the left ends (figure
four) become colder and colder, cooling
the area about them.
By utilizing the effect that Lenz and
Peltier discovered—changing the direc-
tion of the current—we can use the
Peltier effect to heat an area. In this
situation the opposite flow of current in
the circuit causes the charges on the end
of the materials to reverse and the ulti-
mate effect is to switch the hot and cold
ends and we have heat flowing into the
area on the left (figure five).

Problems Remain
That, in a simple way, is how ther-
moelectricity is being applied in principle
today. But in spite of great strides of
progress made there still remain, as
mentioned, numerous obstacles to be con-
quered. Not the least of these is that a
cell similar to those mentioned above
generates only lOths of volts. Of course,
this can be solved, at least partially, by
connecting hundreds of these little cells
together.
More important than thermoelectric
power obtained are the electrical and
thermal conductivity. If the material is
to be suitable it should be highly con-
ductive so that as little as possible current
is dissipated in the circuit itself. On the
other hand it is desirable for the materi-
als to have a low thermal conductivity
so that the whole purpose is not defeated
by a rapid heat transfer within the ma-
terial and not outside it. Finally, the
material must be able to withstand the
high temperatures needed to increase the
voltage difference.
This problem of materials at high
temperature has been one of the hardest,
but also the one on which the most prog-
ress has been made. Dr. TeIkes' research
in the late thirties first opened the door
to the use of semiconductors for thermo-
electric purposes. By using a zinc-anti-
mony and lead sulfide pair she was able
to obtain an efficiency of 7% at tempera-

CRYOGENICS
In the field of cryogenics researchers toil dili-
gently for a thus far unobtainable goal—abso-
lute zero. by ROGER BARNES, '61E
That which was supposed to be un-
attainable has always been an intense
object of curiosity for man. Columbus
was very interested in what lay beyond
the Old World's limited horizon; the
Wright Brothers dared to fly a machine
that would actually enable man to imi-
tate the flights of birds; and more recent-
ly, the possibility of man entering outer
space has no longer remained a fantasy
as it has been in the past. A similar case
history is now being written for research
and investigation in the region of abso-
lute zero. Absolute zero and temperatures
close to it had long remained vague,
without much scientific explanation of
the behavior of matter here. Though
many theories had been advanced explain-
ing what might be found, it was
long believed that the actual attainment
of very low temperatures in laboratory
experiments was impossible.
However, in recent years, with the
development of better equipment and
more precise measuring devices, the pos-
sibility of reaching low temperatures is
no longer as remote as before. In his
attempts to attain absolute zero, man has

done considerable investigation of the
properties of various substances of tem-
peratures in this region. In fact, some
of this low temperature research, called
cryogenics, has been carried on at the
University of Michigan. Specifically, such
research has been in the measurement of
the heat capacities of various materials
over low temperature ranges.
Helium Known First on the Sun
Helium, the last of the inert gases to
be discovered, was first noted in the spec-
tra of light coming from the sun during
the solar eclipse of 1868. Though new
spectral lines were found in these spec-
tral photographs, they were uncommon
to the spectra of substances on the earth.
Therefore, its discoverers called the new
material helium. Peculiarly enough, heli-
um was not found on earth until
thirty years later. The first work with
helium then began and soon the gas was
liquified at the extremely low temperature
of 4.0 degrees Kelvin at a pressure of one
atmosphere.
By subsequent research, a very unusual
vapor pressure—temperature phase dia-
gram was plotted. As shown in Figure
1, there is no triple point on the graph.
That is, at no point does helium exist
in equilibrium in all phases at some

temperature and pressure. In fact, the
line that divides the liquid portion on
the graph, actually divides the liquid por-
tion into two distinct fluids that differ
considerably in their properties. That on
the left is known as helium II, while
that on the right is helium I.
Though helium I behaves very much
like any other liquified gas, it is the
liquid helium II that exhibits very un-
usual properties. One of these is called
mobile transfer. When two containers of
liquid helium II (hereafter referred to as
just liquid helium) are adjusted such
that the smaller one is immersed in the
liquid of the other, the two levels will
tend to toward the same level. What act-
ually happens is that the liquid in the
container having the higher level will
climb out of that container and fall into
the other. Furthermore, if an inner con-
tainer is completely lifted out of the
liquid, the helium in the container will
again climb its walls and can be seen
to drip off the bottom though no obvious
hole is present. Various measurements
give a value for the thickness of this
film of the magnitude of 10 ".
Fountain Effect
A second remarkable property of liquid
helium is known as the "fountain effect."
A very small tube, packed tightly with
emery powder, is immersed in liquid
helium with both ends open and the
upper end protruding above the surface.
When a light is shown upon the emery
powder, a long column of the liquid will
spout out of the upper end of the tube
to a height of a foot or more. As might
be expected, both of the above unique
properties indicate that liquid helium II
has a very low viscosity.
At the time that liquid helium was
first produced, experimenters tried vainly
to produce helium in the solid phase.
Though their attempts were fruitless at
that time, the efforts showed that if solid
helium was first made. Observation of
that which was produced indicated that
it was impossible to tell it from liquid
helium as the indexes of refraction and
densities were nearly identical.

Man v6 The Group
Right-to-Work laws—a crucial issue in the No-
vember elections—are viewed from both sides
in the 1958 Cooley Essay Winner.
The debate over right-to-work laws is
basically a question of establishing
the employment rights of a non-union
worker, his equality of opportunity, ver-
sus establishing and maintaining the
bargaining security and strike-leverage
power of a union within a given com-
pany.
The controversy is based upon the
difference between two fundamental
premises:
"No one may be compelled to belong
to an association." 1
"True liberty . . . implies a sacrifice
for each one of us of some of his
rights in order that other people
may have their rights too." 2
The discussion of these conflicting views
will disclose two modes of present-day
thought concerning Man Versus the
Group.
Right-to-Work
The term "right-to-work" has several
meanings. Right-to-work when used in
this paper implies the right of a worker
not to be debarred from employment
under union security clauses.3 It will not
mean a "claim to continuous employment
which workers have, or are by some peo-
ple supposed to have, on the state, on
society, or industry." * More precisely,
the right to work, as intended here, is
the claim to equal opportunity for work
without regard to union membership
during any stage of employment. It also
means that a worker may have the right
to work in a struck plant when he is not
a member of the union.
The Taft-Hartley Act, passed in 1947,
aided the right-to-work movement con-
siderably. It specifically outlawed the
closed shop in Section 8(a) (3) and
provided that states could outlaw the
union shop if they so desired:
"Nothing in this act shall be con-
strued as authorizing the execution
or application of agreements requir-
ing membership in a labor organiza-
tion as a condition of employment
in any state or territory in which
such execution or application is pro-
hibited by state or territorial law."
(Section 14(b))
A closed shop agreement requires that all
employees must be members of the bar-
gaining unit before they can be hired
for employment. The union shop agree-
ment is merely a modification of the
closed shop requiring that all employees
become members of the union after a
short initial period of employment,
usually thirty days.
It is quite significant that eleven of
the present eighteen state right-to-work
laws were adopted in 1947, the year the
Taft-Hartley Act was passed.
The right-to-work movement, it must
be remembered, is not a movement
sympathetic to organized labor. Unions
describe the movement as anti-labor."'
Realistically, it is anti-z/wo/; because it
allows employees in right-to-work states
to choose between joining or not join-
ing the union. The issue then is spread
somewhat to asking whether the aims
of unions are in keeping with the com-
mon good. If they are, then we may
truly say that the right-to-work move-
ment is open to severe criticism.
by W. PHILIP ARDUSSI, '59E
Man's Right to Free Association
The problem of protecting the right
of free association may seem to be a
problem of our present-day society. This
is not true. In 1892, Herbert Spencer
defended the right of a man to work
without having to pay for it:
"Marvellous are the conclusions men
reach when once they desert the sim-
ple principle that each man should
be allowed to pursue the objects of
life, restrained only by the limits
which the similar pursuits of their
objects by other men impose. The
right to labor is (now) a trade-
union right, which the trade-union
can sell and the individual worker
must buy!" 0
The discussion in the United Nations
concerning articles in the Declaration of
Human Rights must have been extremely
interesting from the standpoint of the
rights of the individual versus the power
of the State, or group, over the indi-
viduals' rights. Dr. Malik of Lebanon
supported the rights and liberties of in-
dividuals:
"Is the State for the sake of the hu-
man person or is the human person
for the sake of the State? That, to
me, is the ultimate question of the
present day. I believe the State is
for the sake of the person and there-
fore our Bill of Rights must express
that for the sake of which everything
else exists, including the States." 7
We may infer that Dr. Malik considers
the issue as one of Man Versus the
Group.

In 1949, the Supreme Court upheld
the right of North Carolina and Nebras-
ka to prohibit employment discrimination
against non-union workers:
"... employers must not discrim-
inate against either union or non-
union members because they are
such." 8
The Court appears to have viewed the
problem of discrimination as being con-
trary to the trend of national labor
policy:
"The national labor policy as set forth
in the Norris-LaGuardia Act, the
Wagner Act, and the Taft-Hartley
Act, always has been that individual
employees should be free to join or
not to join unions just as they
choose. Both the Wagner Act and
Taft-Hartley Act have forbidden em-
ployers to discriminate against em-
ployees either to encourage or dis-
courage union membership. That is
national policy." 9
The Virginia Supreme Court of Ap-
peals in Hawkins v. Finney (1949) em-
phasized that protection of minorities is
"part of the spirit of our fundamental
law." Legislation affording this protection
"does no violence" to this spirit and in
fact is the "basis of our superiority over
totalitarian regimes." 10
Senator Andrews of Florida proposed
in 1946 that the following amendment
to the Constitution be adopted:
"The inherent right of a person to
work and bargain freely with his em-
ployer, individually or collectively,
for terms and conditions of his em-
ployment shall not be denied or in-
fringed by any federal or state law,
or by any organization of whatever
nature." 11
The next year, of course, Taft-Hartley
was passed and aided the right-to-work
movement as this amendment would
have done.
James Carey of the CIO states:
"We have a great heritage of freedom
and equality for all men. The only
way for each individual to obtain
useful employment is at his highest
skill. Race, color, creed, and national
origin are not measures of skill.
Without equality of opportunity the
individual is deprived of the chance
to develop his potentialities and to
share the benefits of our free society.
Our society also suffers through the
loss of the contributions which
might have been made by persons so
denied.
The CIO was founded upon the
proposition that every citizen should
enjoy freedom and equality, without
any exceptions." (emphasis mine)
This statement from the CIO pamphlet
on Federal Employment Practices sug-
gests a paradox to many concerned man-
agement-oriented observers: The CIO,
founded upon freedom and equality,
turns its back, so to speak, on the non-
union citizen's right to associate freely.
Rather, it coerces the non-union worker
by means of the union shop agreement
to join the union.
On July 5, 1935 as President Roose-
velt signed the Wagner Act into law,
he expressed the desire that the Act, "by
preventing practices which tend to des-
troy the independence of labor (would)
seek, for every worker within its scope,
that freedom of choice which is justly
his." 13
Thus far we have seen that the work-
er's right to free association has been
recognized by Herbert Spencer in 1892,
the United Nations, the Supreme Court
in 1949, and President Roosevelt. The
right of free association has been sug-
gested by a United States Senator as
worthy of a Constitutional amendment
and has been allowed for by means of
the protective clause, 14(b), of the Taft-
Hartley Act. Fuurthermore, the CIO, at
least with respect to race, color, and
creed, recognizes the worker's claim to
equality of opportunity.
What about union claims that the
"individual worker in a democratic so-
ciety has some obligations to join to-
gether with his fellows in a union for
the common good"?11 The "common
good" is our next consideration.
Man's Sacrifice for the Common Good
A group may be composed of indi-
viduals who join together in order to
attain common goals which they could
not otherwise achieve. Workers need to
bargain collectively in order to achieve
and "protect interests common to all." 15
"The union is in a much stronger po-
sition to bargain effectively than the
individual worker; because if the
terms offered by the employer are
not satisfactory, they can call a strike.
(An agreement reached by both
sides) will usually be such as to
give employees a better deal than
they could have obtained without
union organization." 10

sacrifice some rights, very often, in order
to acquire more desired ends—the CIO
states that the man who is compelled to
join a union is "deprived of a certain
amount of his individual liberty." 17
"... the mere assertion of rights
will get us nowhere without an
eager willingness towards duty, an
acceptance of sacrifice as a part of
life. True liberty—liberty for all . . .
implies a sacrifice for each one of
us of some of his rights in order
that other people may have their
rights too." 18
The former dean of the School of Law
of Duke University analyzed a recent
Supreme Court decision in the case of
Railway Employees' Department, A F of
L v. Hanson:
"(The Supreme Court) treated the
right-to-work not as a personal lib-
erty, but as equivalent to the long-
range general welfare of the mass of
workers." 19
This Supreme Court decision took the
"common good" point of view in 1955
in contrast to their previous decision in
1949 recognizing the individual's right
to free association.
Differs from Communism
Communism, frequently called "totali-
tarian collectivism," 20 claims the group
principle may be used by government to
achieve economic ends. Mr. Ribinikar of
Yugoslavia presented to the United Na-
tions his government's analysis of the
individual's relation to the common
good:
"We are more and more aware that
real individual liberty can be reached
only in perfect harmony between the
individual and the collectivity. It be-
comes quite obvious that this com-
mon interest is more important than
the individual interest, and that
man can liberate himself only when
the mass of a population is free." 21
It is hoped that Mr. Ribinikar's statement
will be accepted as an excellent descrip-
tion of one particular relationship be-
tween man and the group.
It may be argued that the worker is
morally obligated to support the union
because the Taft-Hartley Act requires
that the union must represent all of the
workers in a unit whether or not they are
members of a union:
"Representatives designated or selec-
ted for the purposes of collective
bargaining by the majority of the
employees in a unit appropriate for
such purposes shall be the exclusive
representative of all the employees
in such unit for the purposes of col-
lective bargaining in respect to rates
of pay, wages, hours of employment,
or other conditions of employment."
(Section 9(a))
The worker who benefits from an or-
ganization that represents his interests
should, it seems, share the costs of the
organization:
"All we ask is that people who bene-
fit from collective bargaining share
the responsibilities and the costs of
union membership." 22
This point is well taken. For example,
we all benefit directly or indirectly from
the Community Chest and should, there-
fore, help to support it.
We cannot say that the common good
of a group of individuals is essential to
personal liberty as Communist philosophy
claims—there is an abject forfeiture of
rights to a greater power inherent in this
view:" . . . this common interest is more
important than the individual interest. . .
However, we may say, purely as a
matter of fact, that all workers who are
a part of the American labor movement
have, first of all, a right to join together
in organizations that are campaigning to
improve working conditions, wages, and
hours; this right has been established
by the Wagner Act. Secondly, we may
also assert that members of the American
labor movement have a "clear and pres-
ent" duty to support authentic repre-
sentatives of the labor movement if such
advocacy is within the dictates of their
conscience and beliefs.
Although man's sacrifice for common
good may not be an immediate sacrifice
for immediate gains, it could result from
his belief that he is morally obligated
to belong to a labor group whose aims
and purposes are in keeping with the
needs of both labor and society as a
whole. This, it seems, is not too much
to ask of individual workers.
Initial Purpose
The purpose of this section has been
to establish the fundamental soundness
of each of the two premises upon which
the right-to-work controversy is based.
Those supporting the individual's right
to free association do so out of an honest
belief that no one should be compelled
to join any organization unless he so de-
sires. On the other hand, many people
feel that the individual is morally obli-
gated to support a group who must repre-
sent him at the bargaining table if he
enjoys advantages which that group has
won for him.
The problem can not be to determine
who is in error in this controversy any-
more than it would be correct to reject
the rights of the individual in favor of
the security of the group or vice-versa.
Both these objectives are important goals

in varying degrees and situations:
"The aim of a society is its own com-
mon good, the good of the social
body. But if we fail to grasp the
fact that this good of the social
body is a common good of human
persons, as the social body itself is
a whole made up of human persons,
this formula would lead in its turn
to other errors, of a collectivist type
■—or to a type of state despotism." 23
The problem is, then, to determine a
course of action with respect to the right-
to-work laws themselves that is in keep-
ing with the needs of our society in this
particular situation: either certain rights
of the individual or security for groups
of individuals will need more emphasis
in order to best serve the common good.
Now that we are confident that neither
the advocates nor the opponents of re-
quired union membership are fundament-
ally in error, significant issues raised by
right-to-work laws will be brought into
sharper focus in the following para-
graphs.
Very definite causal relationships are
advanced by the advocates and opponents
of required union membership. Oppon-
ents, on the one hand, assert that the
need for right-to-work laws has been in-
duced by the growing labor monopoly of
unions and by wage inflation. Advocates
contend, however, that right-to-work
laws will cause the ultimate disintegra-
tion of the free labor movement.
Each claim deserves our serious con-
sideration so that we may decide whether
the threats and dangers presented are
real and therefore compelling. The prob-
lem of "overlegislation" suggested by
Herbert Spencer will also be presented
due to the direct bearing of society's needs
to its laws.
Labor Monopoly and Compulsory
Unionism
"We had been so very powerful and
so very prosperous, that even the
humblest of us were degraded into
the vices and follies of kings, we
lost all measures between means and
ends; and our headlong desires be-
came our politics and our morals." 24
Edmund Burke, a well-known British
statesman 200 years ago, thus expressed
the principal argument against "compul-
sory unionism—the root of monopoly
power." 2r' The claim that union leader-
ship is ignoring the needs of its mem-
bers, "vices and follies of kings," ques-
tions whether labor-unions are indeed
authentic representatives of workers. The
questionable activities of James Hoffa,
the proven fact of misuse of members'
money by Dave Beck, and the vicious
attack upon union critic Victor Riesel
provide ammunition for perhaps the most
verbal among the right-to-work advo-
cates, the National Association of Manu-
facturers:
"The National Association of Manu-
facturers position can be stated simp-
ly. It is against monopoly powers,
their inevitable abuse, whether in
industry, government, or labor. And
it is for individual freedom for
businessmen, for workingmen, and
for the American public." 28
Union power, they claim, generates an
"economic hurricane of menacing pro-
portion—inflation":
"A study of industrial wage, price,
and profit trends recently completed
by the NAM shows that between
1948 and 1956, the dollars paid for
each hour of labor increased twice
as fast as the dollars produced by
each hour of labor." 27
The union leaders, NAM says, "control
the source of labor" and create a wage-
price spiral:
"Once a basic industry is taken into
camp, a chain reaction of price rises
is set into motion. A manufacturer,
forced to pay more for steel because
of wage hikes in that industry, must
increase the price of his product.
His customers, in turn, must pass the
advance on to their outlets, and soon
every segment of the economy has
been infiltrated." 28
The same relationship is also suggested
by Leland Hazard. The classic causes of
inflation, shortage of goods or an over-
abundant supply of bank credit (money),
are not prominent enough today to ex-
plain what is happening to prices:
From all of this a new term has
emerged—wage inflation. Higher wages,
higher prices. The circle is vicious.29
The opponents of required union
membership reason that right-to-work
laws will attack the chief cause of two
immediate and pressing problems—wage
inflation and corrupt labor practices.
Is Right-to-Work A Solution?
Is a right-to-work law the logical ans-
wer to these problems? Will right-to-
work laws help to achieve honest labor
practices? Do right-to-work laws help
combat wage inflation? Insofar as these
particular issues are involved, one must
answer with a qualified "yes."
A right-to-work law will assuredly
make "compulsory unionism" illegal,
thus securing for labor unions a mem-
bership that has joined of its own free
will. This condition, it is argued, will
create an even more effective labor move-
ment that will consist of the "concerned."
The interested workers will then make
their voices heard and will maintain
cleaner unions. They will elect authentic
representatives to further their cause at
the bargaining table.
A right-to-work law will also shake
the control of unions over basic indus-
tries. Less union control, one may say,
will result in less pressure on manage-
ment to provide increases in wages out
of line with industry's increase in pro-
ductivity. The consumer will be protected
from the costs inherent in wage infla-
tion.
Right-to-work laws, however, are not
the only means available for combatting
wage inflation if such a condition, in all
fairness to labor-unions, exists. Indeed,
passage of such laws is secondary to the
foremost method—the long established
and well-recognized process of collective
bargaining. Leland Hazard furnishes this
method for combating wage inflation:
"I think that we in management must
begin now to refuse wage increases
even though we know certainly
that our refusals will produce strikes
. . . labor has got the habit of ask-
ing increases and management has
got the habit of granting them and
passing on the cost by increasing
prices . . . the fact is that manage-
ment does have the power to say no.
. . . Management has more indepen-
dence than does union leadership.
. . .and should begin now to exer-
cise its greater power to say no." 30
It would be unfair not to present Mr.
Hazard's second proposal for combatting
wage inflation:
"I believe that top-level labor and
top-level management and top-level
government must come together in
an open, public, widely publicized
conference—one in which all masks
come off, all pretenses are aban-
doned in a collaborative search for
the key to greater capitalistic suc-
cess. The more quickly decent man-
agement and decent labor define
areas of agreement and explore the
true nature of their honest disa-
greements, the harder it will be for
the shysters and the crooks to oper-
ate." 31
We must remember one basic idea:
Right-to-work laws purport to protect
the individual's right to free association.

OVERSEAS OPPORTUNITIES
Today, more than ever before, foreign lands
beckon engineers to take advantage of the
many and varied overseas job opportunities.
by DON WITHERS, '61E
22
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


a very important decision to make
in the next few years. You must choose
a career to follow, most likely, for a
large part of your life. Chances are very
great that you already have chosen the
type of company with which you wish to
be employed, and possibly have narrowed
the field down to a few specific compan-
ies. Almost inevitably, these companies
are in the United States and possibly
Canada.
But before you make the final choice,
or even before you start narrowing down
to specific companies, give some thought
to foreign employment. Foreign employ-
ment offers many opportunities for en-
gineers, under conditions sometimes
different from those in America. But
how different are these conditions? What
are living conditions like? What is the
pay scale like? What chance for advance-
ment is there? What job security is
offered?
Let's take a brief look at foreign em-
ployment for engineers. Although en-
gineers might find employment in law,
business, and light manufacturing firms,
only the heavy industries of petroleum,
mining, and large scale manufacturing
will immediately interest us.
Job Opportunities
Contrary to some opinion, employ-
ment in other countries is not plentiful
for the American engineer or, for that
matter, for the American. This is because
nationals occupy most of the positions;
even in foreign branches of American
companies nationals fill 97% or more of
the jobs. They even occupy most of the
management positions. Such personnel
policies of American companies promote
better relationships with the country in
which the branch is located.
A starting professional man has a bet-
ter chance of obtaining foreign employ-
ment than a liberal arts student, although
only 3% of the personnel of American
overseas oil companies are American.
Foreign countries usually lack the trained
engineers necessary to explore for and
refine crude materials such as petroleum
or minerals. This is where the American
engineer comes in. Also, many foreign
manufacturing firms want technicians
trained in the field of automation, most
prevalent in the U. S.
Desirable Personal Qualities
What qualities do domestic firms look
for in a prospective engineer seeking em-
ployment in a foreign branch? First and
foremost, the qualities sought for by all
companies, overseas or not, are a sense of
loyalty, a capacity for honest diligent
work, and a sense of responsibility. In
addition, foreign employment places a
greater emphasis on some qualities than
do domestic jobs. An important one is
the ability to get along with people, es-
pecially those of different ideas and cul-
tures. Since the great majority of the
engineer's co-workers are trained nation-
als, this quality in itself quite often deter-
mines his qualifications for the job, be-
cause overseas companies want the Amer-
ican employees to be good-will embassa-
dors. Another very important quality is
that the prospective engineer desires
foreign experiences and an exposure to
other cultures, but fully realizes that
foreign employment is not a picnic or
extended vacation. One other quality
sought by a company is the ability to
work diligently and make accurate deci-
sions away from the presence of an im-
mediate supervisor.
In some companies which specialize
in field exploration, such as Schlumberger,
require that the engineer be single when
employed in the field, due to the short-
age of accomodations in camp.
Overseas Job Security
When an American engineer looks for
a foreign job, he seldom wants to be-
come part of a wildcat firm with a 50-
50 chance of success. He, naturally, will
seek employment in an American firm.
All firms of medium or large size repre-
sent a sizeable investment of capital, and
the investor or supporting company has
found the investment to be sound and a
good risk. New companies are usually
foreign branches of established compan-
ies and offer the same domestic security
to prospective employees.
Overseas employees, once they have
been accepted, represent a sizeable in-
vestment of company money and time
and are considered valuable to the com-
pany. Therefore, the company will do as
much as possible to keep the engineer
satisfied with his job and its future se-
curity. In most companies, domestic in-
surance and pension plans are carried
over for the American engineer in a
foreign land.
Chances for Advancement
Opportunity for advancement over-
seas is somewhat greater than that in the
United States, providing the engineer is
willing to work hard. After some experi-
ence with refinery or metal processing
equipment, the engineer is put in a po-
sition of importance which is similar to
his would-be position in a domestic com-
pany. As the engineer gathers experience
and training, he is moved upwards to
suit his capabilities.
Most American engineers accept a
foreign job with the intention of working
up through the ranks overseas, thereby
gaining a more general training than his
domestic contemporary, and eventually
stepping into a management position.
Most of the engineers in foreign man-
agement positions are preparing to return
to America and manage.
When he returns to the States after
some years of foreign experience in man-

A NEW CONCEPT
Less than four years old, Science Engineering
has already blazed a new trail in engineering
education. ~ by MAX LEGATSKI, '61E
Today's engineers are faced with prob-
lems that their elders never dreamed
of. For example, even the engineers work-
ing on some of our more elementary
rocket guidance and control systems must
have a range of knowledge which includes
radio electronics, circuit techniques, auto-
matic computation facilities, mathema-
tics, and even industrial psychology.
More important, they must be versatile
enough to comprehend the scope of
most problems concerning the rockets
and the rest of the complicated mechan-
ism of which they are a part. But no
matter how complex or huge the system
is, there must be men at the controls,
familiar with every aspect of the opera-
tion, who can make decisions.
We may now ask, "Will the education
which is offered us today prepare us for
jobs like these and the even bigger jobs
which will be waiting for us when we
graduate?" Unfortunately, many people
think that it will not.
Large electronic and mechanical sys-
tems are growing in size, number, and
the variety of component parts, and
as they grow, they become more closely
related to important economic considera-
tions and large business organizations.
Though they are designed and construc-
ted by large groups of people, many corn-

plex systems will be supervised by us,
tomorrow's engineers, and as these sys-
tems grow, we may expect an increasing
trend of engineers into responsible man-
agement positions.
It is this trend which marks the differ-
ence between yesterday's engineer and to-
morrow's engineer, and it is therefore the
change for which today's engineering
student must prepare.
Engineering began with the need for
men with a knowledge of industrial arts,
and it thrived because universities teach-
ing engineering added scientific knowl-
edge and placed engineering graduates
in a position of intellectual leadership.
However, our education must face up to
the fact that it is now almost a hopeless
task to teach industrial arts completely
and effectively in four of five years, the
time allotted to the universities in accord-
ance with society's demand that a young
man establish a home in his early twen-
ties. Yet most present-day engineering
curricula are based on the premise of
teaching a considerable quantity of know-
how, rather than basic knowledge.
The universities, then, are faced with
the basic problem of educating the aver-
age man over a period of about four
years for his participation in a complex
technical world which is constantly
changing and evolving. Since this pur-
pose will not be served by increasing the
technical content of curricula at the ex-
pense of content which develops social
and philosophical perspective, it is ap-
parent that the universities can solve this

24
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC



problem only through increased effective-
ness in the technical stem of the engin-
eering curriculum. This is being done at
the University of Michigan through the
development of a new program known as
Science Engineering.
Science Engineering
The title of "Science Engineering,"
instead of "engineering science," is used
to emphasize the use of science in en-
gineering rather than in scientific investi-
gation. The Science Engineer is expected
to make use of an understanding of na-
ture, rather than provide an understand-
ing of nature; the former is the objective
of engineering research and design,
while the latter is the objective of scien-
tific research.
A more complete statement of the
problem faced by the designers of the
Science Engineering program is in part
a reiteration of what has already been
said; nevertheless, it is necessary in
order to appreciate the need for this
rather radical development in the con-
cept of engineering education.
The competent teacher is expected to
keep the content of his courses abreast
of the changing times. However, when
course content becomes greater than can
be handled in the available number of

any particular field, the curriculum be-
comes crowded and unbalanced.
The addition of specialized courses
and required courses in math and physics
leads to curricula with a minimum of
flexibility and to the elimination of non-
technical or non-essential courses, giving
the student a disconnected survey of
physical theories, facts, and devices, and
a small acquaintance with the humanities
and the social sciences. Admitting that
there will always be a need for the spec-
ialized engineer, this sort of education
nevertheless, does little to prepare the
versatile "management" engineer, for
which the real need is only beginning.
Two rather fundamental problems seem
to arise from the rapid technological ad-
vances in industry. The first—about which


FEBRUARY, 1959
25



little has been said—is the need for more
basic science coupled with the need for
more effective use of mathematics in cur-
ricula. A step towards the solution of
this problem is the integration of curricu-
la where required basic science courses,
instead of running in parallel and in
series, are interdependent and closely re-
lated. The second, the crowding of cur-
ricula brought about by piling on spec-
ialized courses, is at least partially solved
by the integration of subject matter into
fewer courses built around fundamentals
and illustrated by specialized examples,
in place of courses which are built around
specialized examples.
What Is Being Done at Michigan
Since the Science Engineering curricu-
lum is elected primarily by students wish-
ing to build up a strong background for
postgraduate work or to obtain an edu-
cation suitable for a career in research
and development, the Science Engineering
Committee has stated the objectives of
the Science Engineering program to be:
1) "to provide a strong educational
basis for postgraduate work in the
various engineering specialties" and
2) "to provide a broad scientific
education in engineering through a
curriculum which incorporates the elec-
tive flexibility necessary to satisfy the
diverse interests of modern engineer-
ing."
Thus the primary purpose is to devel-
op habits of thought, initiative, and im-
agination, rather than to teach "hand-
book courses," built around specialized
examples, which may be obsolete by the
time the student graduates. This requires
a solid grounding in the basic and en-
gineering sciences, supplemented by
"socio-humanistic" subjects, with an
emphasis on mathematics early in the
curriculum; it also requires a minimum
degree of specialization to provide depth
as well as perspective.
To acquire a more effective knowledge
of mathematics, it is desirable to give the
student more freedom of election during
the last two years of his education, so that
he has an opportunity to develop mathe-
matical maturity and to practice the apli-
cation of fundamentals in the area of his
interest. This means, of course, that the
integrated curriculum is possible only dur-
ing the first two years of his education.
An additional feature of this arrangement
is that the student, after two years in the
Science Engineering curriculum, may
transfer to any other department in the
College of Engineering without loss of
credit.
The structure of the Science Engineer-
ing curriculum is based on the premise
that required courses should include only
that subject material which all engineers
must master. The English, drawing,
mathematics, chemistry, and physics
which are required during the first two
years of the curriculum, represent the
basic level of achievement that is required
of all engineering students in every pro-
gram. The advanced math, science, and
engineering science represent a broad un-

derstanding of the engineering sciences
which is common to all engineering pro-
grams, though the level of attainment in
science is equivalent to that usually re-
quired for MSE degrees. This arrange-
ment has obvious advantages from the
standpoint of the engineer in a manage-
ment position.
Possible Electives Many
The electives in engineering include a
professional sequence composed by the
student, with the aid of a faculty advisor,
according to the special interests of the
student. This sequence must be an inte-
grated sequence, and it must include at
least one course in analysis or design. All
prerequisite courses are provided in the
engineering science sequence during the
first two years, so that the professional
sequence need only to include the most
important subject matter from the par-
ticular specialization.
A number of courses have been devel-
oped, and a few have been revised (*),
to meet the requirements of the Science
Engineering program. They are listed on
page 52 so that the reader may note the
generality of the subject matter, i.e., they
are not peculiar to any particular field of
engineering alone:

COLOR T.V.
While there are still problems and difficulties
that must be conquered, Color TV is on the
verge of becoming as common as black and
white. by JAY SKLAR, '60E
Now that black-and-white television
has found its way into the homes
of millions of Americans, and has be-
come as commonplace as the radio or
telephone, one might readily imagine
that most of the problems of transmission
and reception are solved. This is certain-
ly true. Although there are still a few
difficulties remaining, the major prob-
lems have been solved. Clarity and con-
trast have been improved tremendously
since the early days of TV. Larger screens
have been economically developed. Mea-
sures to reduce the excessive depth of the
picture tube have also been successful.
Surely the contrast between the television
set of today and that of ten years ago is
a fantastic one. Thus the TV industry
has prepared itself for the final, most
striking improvement—the addition of
color.
Basically, color on the television screen
is reproduced by a process involving the
mixture of colored lights. If a color slide
or motion picture frame is observed care-
fully, there can be seen three layers of
emulsion. One of these is devoted to the
red tones, a second to the yellow colors,
and the final one to the blues. Utilizing
these three color layers, all tones can be
obtained. For example, if orange is de-
sired, layers of yellow and red in equal
densities can be overlapped. Then if a
red-orange is wanted, a low density yel-
low can be layed over a high density red.
Colored reproductions of all types use
this basic technique including the famil-
iar Kodachromes, lithographs, and dot-
process reproductions. It is not surprising
then, to find that color television obtains
its chromaticity in this same way.
In considering color on the TV screen,
there is one factor that must be continu-
ously remembered: the image on the
screen is almost instantaneous and changes
many times each second. This considera-
tion alone presented most of the diffi-
culties encountered when color television
was developed.
Many Fields Involved
These problems ranged into many fields
and involved scientists of various train-
ings. Since the coating on the screen must
be capable of retaining the image long
enough for it to be seen, yet not so long
that a succeeding image would run into
it, special phosphors in different colors
had to be developed. This involved the
chemist. Since the adaptation of the eye
to these varying images had to be con-
sidered, the psychologist played an im-
portant role in developing color TV.
And since the whole technique of putting
electron beams in the picture tube was
an electronic one, the electrical engineer
and physicist were necessary. Thus the
problems of color TV embraced many
fields. A great deal of cooperation among
them made possible the rapid develop-
ment of this new dimension in television.
Since color TV is essentially an em-
bellishment of black and white, it might
be well to include a brief summary of
the methods employed in bringing these
pictures into the home. Television is it-
self an elaboration of the radio. Both
radio and television include a transmis-
sion system capable of broadcasting and
receiving electrical waves. The radio
waves include information pertaining to
the reproduction of sound at the listen-
er's end of the system. Television waves
include this information, but also con-
tain a great deal of data necessary for
reproducing a picture. Therefore the tele-
vision system consists of four sections:
a device to convert the light image in the
studio into electrical waves, a signal
broadcasting network, a receiving station,
and finally additional equipment in the
home to reconvert the electrical waves in-
to light images on the TV screen. The
image orthicon tube is used to perform
the first function and the cathode ray
tube to perform the last. Transmitting
and receiving is done by cicuitry essen-
tially the same as ordinary radio equip-
ment. (Details concerning the operation
of these are too complex for this article).
As mentioned before, color television
receives its chromaticity from three images

each of a different primary color. All
three pictures are placed on the screen
simultaneously by electronic means to give
the illusion of full color operation. Each
of these pictures is derived from an

of any color can be formed by mixing
various proportions of three primary
colored lights. Similarly, light of any
color can be separated into its three pri-
mary components. After separation, the
three light beams will each be of the
proper intensity so that if they are
mixed together they will again form
light of the original color. Separating the
scene inside the studio into three pri-
mary images must be accomplished in the
TV camera. The television industry uses
red, blue and green as primaries.
Two Methods
There are two common means of doing
this. However, both methods employ
what are known as filters. A filter is a
piece of glass which will allow only
light of certain colors to pass. The first
method of separation simply uses three
image orthicon tubes each equipped with
the proper filter so that only one primary
color will pass into each tube. All the
red components of the lights in the scene
will enter one tube, all the green a sec-
ond and the blue a third. The orthicon
tubes convert the separate primary images
into separate electrical waves.
Another method commonly used is to
separate the light by special mirrors.
Suppose a single beam of light of assorted
wavelengths passes into the TV camera.
First it comes upon a special mirror
which has the property that it will reflect
light of a certain frequency and pass the
remaining light. Then if the mirror is
placed at forty-five degrees to the beam,
the reflected light beam will end up at
right angles to the incident light beam.
Thus the incident beam will continue
through the camera without the color
that is reflected. After meeting this
mirror, the remaining light hits a second
mirror that reflects a separate frequency.
In this way, another frequency is re-
moved. A correctly designed system con-
tains mirrors such that one mirror reflects
red and the other blue. Therefore, the
three primary colors are separated from
the incident light. (No mirror for the
green is necessary, since, after red and
blue are removed, only green remains.
The three separate light beams are each
converted to electrical waves by a sep-
arate orthicon tube.
Most of the equipment employed in
the color TV industry is based on Grass-
man's Law. Without this law and the
equipment associated with it, color TV
would be practically impossible. The law
states: when equivalent lights are added
to equivalent lights, the sums are equiva-
lent. Indeed, this sounds complex. Actual-
ly, it implies that lights based on one
primary system can be linearly converted
to lights in another. Consider a color X
made up of so much, say r, of primary
A, so much, say s, of primary B, and
t of primary C. Thus:
X = rA -f sB + tC
Now consider a second primary system of
primaries L, M, and N. A, B, and C,
the primaries of the first system can be
represented, according to Grassman's Law
by equations in L, M, and N and a trans-
formation can be made so that X is
linearly represented in the second system
of primaries. It is a simple network
problem to arrange circuitry to perform
this transformation automatically. Grass-
man's Law allows us to convert readily
from one primary system to another on
a continuous basis.
Compatibility
Compatibility is a word much heard in
connection with color TV. When color
was first conceived, there was the concern
that all black and white sets would be
outmoded. Any program broadcast in

color would not be tunable on black and
white equipment. Also, programs broad-
cast in black and white would not be re-
ceivable on color sets. Grassman's Law
allows compatibility to become effective.
Instead of using the red, blue, and green
system as the broadcasting signals, the
electrical waves received from the image
orthicon tube system in the camera are
put through a transformation network to
convert them to a new primary system.
In this system, one of the primaries corre-
sponds exactly to the black and white
signal. Thus this signal is the one re-
ceived on black and white sets and is the
one tuned on the color sets when the
program is broadcast in black and white.
Since there are three separate waves
transmitted for color, another problem
arises. Broadcasting requires a certain
bandwidth in the radio frequency spec-
trum. When a radio is tuned to, say 880
kc, the signal is not only at 880 kc, but
also extends a few kilocycles to either
side. In the same way, television signals
occupy a certain bandwidth. Because of
certain sidebands that cannot be elimi-
nated, the Federal Communications Com-
mission set up a standard of six mega-
cycles as the maximum allowable band-
width for television. It was felt that this
would be ample for practical transmitting
technology and would also allow a suffi-
cient number of channels to operate over
the limited existing spectrum. However,
in the case of color TV, there are three
broadcasting signals. It would certainly
be impractical for each channel to use
This diagram shows how it is theoretic-
ally possible to transmit color TV signals.
three six megacycle bands, or a total of
18 mc to broadcast one program. Some-
how band space had to be conserved.
Therefore, a principle known as multi-
plexing was established and techniques
devised to put it into practical use. Al-
though the techniques are too complex
for this article, the principle is easy to
understand. Instead of using three sepa-
rate channels for the three separate sig-
nals, all three signals are broadcast in the
same channel space. The signals are sep-
arated either by a time difference as in
the time-sequential system or by phase as
in the simultaneous system. It is enough
to say that it is very possible to limit
the bandwidth and to transmit sufficient
information on six megacycles so that the
receiver can put a good color picture on
the screen.
In the receiver, the multiplexed signal
is unscrambled in the detector stages. By
this means, the same three separate elec-
trical signals that existed in the camera,
now exist in the receiver. The only re-
maining operation is to convert these
electrical waves to a single full color pic-
ture. This is done in the picture tube.
Three Picture Tubes
There are three basic types of picture
tubes, all differing in the principle em-
ployed throughout their design. First,
there is the variety based on the super-
position principle. Utilizing three pro-
jection guns and a series of converging
mirrors, this tube achieves its aim by
focusing three primary images on a com-
mon screen. The various colors are mixed
directly on the glass. Because of the com-
plex methods needed to change the elec-
tron beam to a light beam, this method is
not common. In addition, a difficult
problem arises in aligning the three pic-
tures.
The second type of tube is more prac-
tical and was even seriously considered
as a possible standard by the Federal
Communications Commission. Instead of
combining the colored lights directly in
a screen, this tube relies on the persistence
of vision effect of the human eye. The
three electrical waves are each delayed a
few microseconds and then combined.
Thus we have the information concern-
ing the red following the data for the
green. The blue data follows both of
these. Therefore when this single elec-
trical wave is fed to a cathode ray tube,
an image of those objects containing
green shades is first flashed on the screen,
then an image of the reds is seen, and
finally an image of the blues appears.
However, the face of the screen is cov-
ered with a white phosphor. To add the
color effect, a wheel with colored glass
blades is rotated before the screen. When
the black and white image of the red
objects is seen on the screen, a red blade
is in front of it. Thus the red objects
appear red. Similarly with the other

THE HISTORY OF TV.
by KEN DEC, '61E
This month's edition of Pioneering
Progress will salute one of the big-
gest entertainment mediums in America.
. . . Television. Each year millions of
dollars and billions of hours are spent
across the country producing and watch-
ing TV shows. Its sudden success as
an entertainment medium identifies Tele-
vision as a recent development of the
electronics industry. This identification
is false, for even before the turn of the
century, the ideas and early experiments
in the transmission of pictures over elec-
trical circuits were begun. Television is
unique in the annals of scientific inven-
tion for it is a development of not one,
but a huge number of scientists and en-
gineers from a variety of different coun-
tries.
Rapid Developments of the 19th Century
No discussion of television develop-
ment can be made without first giving
credit to the very early researchers in
electronics and chemistry. Although
these men had no idea of electrical pic-
ture transmission when they first conduct-
ed their experiments, their discoveries
became the foundation for all future
electronic development. To mention all
of these men and their discoveries would
be tedious, but a few of the more im-
portant contribution were Bevzelius, Oers-
ted, Wheatstone, Faraday, Sturgon, Her-
schel, Bequerel, and Edison. Some of
these men and their discoveries will be
mentioned again in further discussions.
The story of Television "begins" in
1873 with the discovery of the photo-
electric nature of crystalline selenium.
This metal possesses the strange proper-

touched photograph taken at the first
demonstration of television, given by
Dr. J. T, Baird at the Royal Institute.
ty of having lower electric resistance
when subjected to a light source. The
realization of selenium's photo-electric
quality led to the first Television meth-
ods. In that same year May (first name
unknown) built a machine to transmit
pictures electrically. The machine did not
work, but at least the eye of Television
had blinked.
Two years later, in 1875, an American,
G. R. Carey of Boston, designed what
was probably the first Television system.
He tried to imitate the human eye by
sending a view of a picture all in one
"lump." The picture was focused on a
huge bank, or mosaic of individual
selenium cells, each with its own elec-
trical circuit. The receiver was a bank
of electric bulbs, each bulb connected to
a selenium cell, and having the same
relative position in the bank as the cell
had in the mosaic.
Thus, when the reflected light from
the object struck the mosaic, it changed
the resistance of the cell, and therefore
the amount of light emitted from the
corresponding light in the receiver bank.
A very clever invention true, but very-
little detail could be produced—only-
rough outlines. A detailed picture would
have required a quarter million cells,
lamps and circuits, and this device would
be obviously too cumbersome.
In the following years three discov-
eries, important to the future of Televi-
sion, were made. Carey continued his

experiments and found a way to devide
the picture into segments before trying
to transmit it. John Kerr invented the
"Kerr Cell," a device used to control
light rays in a number of T.V. systems
of later years. In 1878 Crooks generated
the first cathode rays, thus beginning the
development of the Cathode Ray tube, on
which present day T.V. is based. Maurice
Leblanc, in 1880, developed the idea of
"scanning" a picture, a principle used in
all modern T.V. cameras and receivers.
In 1884 Paul Nipkow, a German, real-
ized the limitations of Carey*s method of
transmitting images, and the importance
of the theory of scanning. Instead of us-
ing banks of cells, he invented the
"Nipkow Disc," a revolving metal disc-
perforated with a series of holes. This
disc was used to scan the picture and
separate it into tiny sections, and was
the basis of most Television methods
until the 1930 s.
As the nineteenth century was coming
to an end, Karl Braun made his "cath-
ode ray" tube, the forerunner of the T.V.
picture tubes of today. He learned that
electrons were attracted, and could be
controlled by magnetic forces. By coating
the screen of his tube with flourscent
substances, he was able to trace the paths
of electrons, just as in modern day re-
ceivers.
The first few years of the twentieth
century did not add much to the devel-
opment of Television. Radio, however,
began to flourish, for it was at this time
that Marconi found it was possible to
send radio messages across the Atlantic
Ocean. It was also during this time that
a man named Albert Einstein announced
the theory of the Photo electric effect, a
fundamental of the T.V. camera. It de-
fined the way in which cameras would
turn pictures into electricity.
In 1904 Fleming produced the first
"two element" thermodynamic valve
(diode). This valve pointed the way to
an efficient method of amplifing elec-
trical impulses millions of times. The
method came in 1906 when an American,
Lee De Forest, invented the three ele-
ment triode. The triode has become the
heart of modern radio and television, for
it builds up and pumps out the electrical
"bloodstream."
The next important contribution to
television research came in 1907 by way
of a great Russian Physicist Boris Rosing,
of St. Petersburg Technological Institute.
Rosing patented a T.V. system using a
receiver essentially the same as modern
sets. This set was based on the cathode
ray tube and a system of revolving
mirrors. The set, however, did not form
satisfactory pictures for the cathode ray
tubes and selenium cells used were in the
crude form and contained many imper-
fections. Rosing also lacked a method of
amplifying electrical impulses, for De
Forests triode had just been invented
and was in his laboratory four and a
half thousand miles away.
Rosing did not know it at the time,
but one of his students, Valdemir Zwoiy-
kin, was destained to perfect the first
satisfactory television camera, twenty-six
years later.
During the years of Rosing's experi-
ments, the real surge for T.V. develop-
ment was born. Men in Europe and
America proposing all types of television
systems. One of the most important of
these came from an English scientist, A.
A. Campbell-Swenton. His idea was sim-
ilar to Boris Rosings, in the use of a
cathode ray receiver, but the Campbell-
Swenton system also employed the use
of a cathode ray T.V. camera.
With this last missing link, the Camp-
bell-Swenton camera, most of the funda-
mental points on which modern tele-
vision is based were known. Had it not
been for the First World War, the world
might have had Television in the 1920's.
But as it was, the war brought T.V. de-
velopment to a standstill for almost a
decade. The consequence of war after
the fighting was over also slowed down
the western civilizations and stopped
T.V. progress for another decade. Finally,
when the before mentioned Vlademir
Zwoiykin developed his camera and revo-
lutionized television in the 1930's, prac-
tical Television was born.

Another Unmatched Engineering Facility to
Advance Propulsion Systems of the Future
Future aircraft and missiles may require propulsion
systems far different from those in wide use today
— different in size, power output, appearance, and
perhaps even in the basic method of utilizing energy.
To probe the propulsion future . . . and to build
and test greatly advanced propulsion systems for
coming generations of flight vehicles, Pratt &amp;
Whitney Aircraft is now operating its new Florida
Research and Development Center. This facility
supplements Pratt &amp; Whitney's main research and
development installations in Connecticut.
The new Florida Center, financed and built by
Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, is unique in America's
air industry. Here a completely air-conditioned
plant with 17 acres under roof is specially designed
and equipped for the development of new power
plants of virtually any type. Testing is handled in
special isolated areas; the nearest is four miles
from the plant and many miles from any inhabited
area. The new Center can be greatly expanded on
its 10-square-mile site. Continued isolation is in-
sured by a vast wildlife sanctuary in which the
Center is located.
Of the many people employed at the Center to-
day, about half are scientists, engineers and highly
trained technicians. By late next year, the total
number is expected to be almost doubled.
The new Florida Research and Development
Center is one more reason why Pratt &amp; Whitney
Aircraft is able to continue producing the world's
best aircraft propulsion systems ... in whatever
form they take.

se, is not to combat so-called labor mon-
opoly nor is the intention to "clean up
the labor movement." We have already
agreed that the intended purpose of
right-to-work laws is fundamentally
sound. However, if our intention is to
clean the labor movement of corrupt
practices or to combat wage inflation, our
laws should reflect that intention as we
shall see in Part C, "Over Legislation."
Because the advocates of required union
membership claim that right-to-work
laws may cause the loss of a justifiable
strike-leverage power within a given com-
pany, we must consider the issue of
union security as an integral part of the
controversy.
Right-to-"Wreck" Laws and Union
Security
If a union loses the power to enforce
observance of a contract it has signed
with management, its effectiveness as a
bargaining agent is radically reduced.
The union members will no longer have
confidence in the ability of the union to
achieve those ends which have been asked
of it. Such a situation can arise when all
the workers in a company are not mem-
bers of the union:
"(The union) can never be certain
that it can actually call out the men
on strike, or that it can enforce ob-
servance of an agreement it has
signed." 32
The reduced effectiveness of the union
may become a vital issue:
"Many a union has come to grief
through the blighting influence of
the open shop, or has saved itself
from ruin by shifting to the closed
shop basis before it was too enfee-
bled to make the move." 33
A labor writer proposes only one alter-
native to the union shop:
"The only alternative to the union
shop is the ultimate disintegration
of the free labor movement. Over
the long run either the union will
attain 100% membership or be-
come completely ineffectual." 34
A labor economics textbook showed that
union security is bound by its very roots
to the union shop:
"One's attitude toward the union shop
is bound to depend on how one an-
swers the following questions: It it
desirable to maintain strong, sta-
ble, and permanent unions in Ameri-
can industry?" 35
Furthermore, the loss of union security
may have consequences within society
itself.
"... union security is also in the
social interest. Without it, no union
can be expected to accept the respon-
sibility for labor relations and for
contract observance which our so-
ciety must demand of a successful
union movement." 36.
In view of the weak position of one
worker, acting alone, to bargain with an
employer over terms of employment and
his right to receive an equitable return
for his services,37 we must admit that the
aims of labor unions are in the worker's
interest. We should also say that the
common good of society requires an effec-
tive labor movement and also requires
clean unions that are authentic represen-
tatives of labor—such unions should be
maintained in a position of strength,
stability, and permanency in American
industry.
Union security is therefore justifiable
on the grounds that it aids collective
bargaining and is necessary to protect
the collective interests of the workers.
The elements of the labor movement
that need "cleaning up," and such ap-
pears to be the case, are subject to judi-
cial action within the framework of our
present laws.
Whether a right-to-work law is a
valid means of combatting labor corrup-
tion is open to discussion. We may con-
sider a right-to-work law as a convincing
bit of "over legislation." Herbert Spencer
provides us with some pronounced views
concerning over legislation.
Over Legislation
A collection of very penetrating and
far-reaching essays about Man Versus the
Group were written by Herbert Spencer,
a British nineteenth-century philosopher:
"Strong as it looks at the outset,
State-agency perpetually disappoints
everyone. Puny as are its first stages,
private effort daily achieves results
that astound the world." 38
Spencer was concerned with the growing
trend of governmental control in England
and devised a system for explaining so-
cial action. What we as individuals do,
he says, is directly dependent upon the
urgency of all our needs. The most im-
portant needs are satisfied first and, "if
need be to the neglect of the weaker
and less important ones." 39 Social action,
as a whole, will naturally follow this
"order of relative importance" even more
uniformly because individual idiosyncra-
sies are averaged.
Spencer is quite convincing when he
speaks about the evils of over legislation:
"No man or men by inspecting so-
ciety can see what it most needs; so-
ciety must be left to feel what it
most needs." 40
He speaks from the past with alarming
relevancy:
"Take up a daily paper and you will
probably find a leader exposing the
corruption, negligence, or misman-
agement of some State-department.
Cast your eye down the next column,
and it is not unlikely that you will
read proposals for an extension of
State-supervision." 41
The extension of State-supervision will
probably result in the proposal of some
law to cure the evils of society:
"Moreover, when these topical reme-
dies applied by statesmen do not
exacerbate the evils they were meant
to cure, they constantly induce col-
lateral evils; and these often greater
than the original ones." 42
Spenser's views apply directly to our dis-
cussion of the need for right-to-work
laws.
Right-to-work laws, we have seen, are
based upon the desire to protect the right
of the individual to associate freely from

SIGNALS FROM VEHICLES IN SPACE
The exploration of outer space has taken a new step
forward with the completion of the new giant radio
antenna which has recently been installed by JPL at Gold-
stone near Barstow, California. This huge "dish," 85 ft.
in diameter, enables the Laboratory scientists to probe
still farther into space problems.
The Goldstone antenna is presently tracking rocket
probes far out in space. Information thus obtained from
Explorer satellites and Pioneer space probes is being
reduced and studied to provide invaluable basic data for
future space programs.
The Goldstone link from space to earth will be extended
from the present range of 500,000 miles to many times
that figure, bringing the planets Mars and Venus within
its reach.

SPOTLIGHTS
PROGRESS
Compiled by MIKE MALINOWSKI, '61E
During the past few years, interest in
science has increased at a rapid
rate. If scientific progress was moving
at the speed of sound during the '40's,
then it's surpassing the speed of light
at present. Each month we can only
cover an infinitesimally small amount of
progress in our limited space. We try
to take a good cross-section of news,
with the idea of presenting only the
interesting.
Here is a summary of what "Spot-
lights" is covering this month. There is
a review of a college physics course be-
ing taught on TV. A new satellite is
being readied to observe the sun 24 hours
a day. New means of predicting atomic
fuel life is being sought. For the de-
fense of our country a radar system
35,000 ft. high is being developed.
Uranium, the super fuel, now is being

Physics Taught on TV
The facilities of a major television
network have been turned into a three
million square mile classroom for a full
credit college course in atomic age
physics.
Called Continental Classroom, the pro-
gram is telecast across the country every
morning from 6:30 to 7:00 (local time)
by the owned and affiliate stations of
the National Broadcasting Company.
The course is being offered for credit
by more than 300 colleges and univer-
sities and will cover two semesters of
physics review—from a discussion of ex-
perimental method to a lecture on inertial
guidance systems.
It is the first time in the history of
television that a full year course in any
field of education has been offered to
the general public on a nation-wide basis.
Conducted by Dr. Harvey E. White,
Professor of Physics at the University of
California at Berkeley and consultant to
the Atomic Energy Commission, the
course started October 6 and will run
through June 5, 1959- Occasionally dur-
ing the class year guest experts, drawn
from the ranks of the nation's leading
physicists, will conduct special lectures.
Experiments and demonstrations pre-
sented with standard teaching aids and
unusual scientific instruments are an in-
tegral part of the daily lectures. Unique
among the devices being used is a stand-
ard engineering drafting machine adapted
to fit Continental Classroom's 21-foot
blackboard. Called the Paragon Auto-
Flow, the machine's projector and draw-
ing rule have been equipped with over-
size calibrations and numerals for easier
reading on camera.
The Continental Classroom is a chal-
lenging and rugged proving ground for
many kinds of scientific demonstration
device.
"Since this educational venture is
aimed largely at high school science
teachers," said M. G. Thomas, educa-
tional sales manager, "we regard it as
an excellent opportunity for instructors
to see and evaluate instruments under
specialized conditions."
There is also a seven-foot demonstra-
tion slide rule employed by Dr. White
in sample problem solving. The king-
size rule is idneitcal to the instrument
used for years in engineering schools
throughout North America.
During the first semester Continental
Classroom will stress those physical prin-
ciples necessary for an understanding of
atomic and nuclear physics: kinematics,
light, dynamics, electricity, hydraulics
and magnetism. In the second semester
emphasis will be on atomic and nuclear
physics. Television lectures will be sup-
plemented by tests administered by the
colleges, textbook assignments, problem
solving and other out-of-class activities.
In the opening session of Continental
Classroom Dr. James R. Killian, Jr.,
Special Assistant to President Eisenhower
for Science and Technology, called the
show "truly a bold experiment in the
nation's interest."
"We need more and better teachers
and students of physics in the United
States if we are to realize the potential
inherent in science," Dr. Killian said as
guest on the premiere telecast.
Continental Classroom is sponsored
jointly by NBC, The Ford Foundation,
the American Association of Colleges for
Teacher Education and the Fund for the
Advancement of Education.
Participating colleges and universities
may utilize the program at no cost and
may charge regular tuition fees for those
registering for credit. The AACTE
recommends that a minimum of three
hours of credit be given each semester;
however, the amount of credit a college
or university offers will be determined
locally.

Satellites Observe Sun
Satellite observatories for getting an
unobstructed, 24-hour a day look at the
sun, may be just around the scientific
corner, a University of Michigan astron-
omer said.
The observatories are part of "the
bright future for astronomers as they
enter this momentous revolutionary era
of all time," said Prof. Leo Goldberg,
chairman of the U-M Department of
Astronomy.
Such a solar satellite has already been
designed by a St. Louis Aircraft Manu-
facturer, Professor Goldberg said.
The U-M scientist was selected to pre-
sent the 25th Annual James Arthur Lec-
ture on the Sun at the Smithsonian
Institution.
The biggest problem of solar observa-
tion has been obstruction by the earth's
atmosphere of ultra-violet radiation
emitted from the sun—important to the
study of the sun's characteristics. Visible
light, which is what observers on the
ground use as a basis for their study
of the sun, doesn't tell the whole story.
The satellite observatory, scheduled
for intensive laboratory experimentation,
would circle 400 miles above the earth
and thus interference by the atmosphere
should be completely eliminated, Gold-
berg said.
Describing the satellite, he revealed:
"The entire instrument package will
weigh less than 300 pounds and will
include a stabilization and control sys-
tem for precision pointing of instruments
at the sun, power supply, and equip-
ment for recording data and transmitting
the information upon command from
earth."
Professor Goldberg cautioned, how-
ever:
"Much in the way of laboratory ex-
perimentation will be required to ensure
that the satellite and instrumentation will
withstand the severe accelerations and
vibrations during launching operation,
and also to make sure the systems en-
visaged for the stabilization and pointing
control system and for the recording,
storage and transmission of data func-
tion correctly."
Goldberg added that the experimental
scheme is based on satellite payloads
"that will quite certainly be feasible
within the coming year or two."
Up to now, he said, the greatest Iimita-

Here it is, the start of another semes-
ter. If you're reading this, you
must have made it through finals, so the
teasers this month should not be too
hard. Or will they? Well, try them and
find out.
A certain farmer received an order
for four crates (A, B, C, and D) of
eggs. The order stated that the number
of eggs in any two crates was to be a
perfect square, and the number in whole
four crates must also be a perfect square.
Now the farmer's problem is: What is
the smallest number of eggs that can
be put in the crates to fulfill these condi-
tions—a different number being in each
crate.

It's not exactly the time of year for
fishing, but here is a fish story.
A man caught a shark and when
boasting about it, he would only say that
the head was 14 ft. long, the tail was as
long as the head and one-quarter of the
back while the back was as long as the
head and twice the tail. Find the length
of the fish.
* * *
If you are thinking ahead of spring
vacation and are planning to take a trip,
this teaser should provide some useful
figuring.
A car makes three trips all of equal
length. The speed in miles per hour of
the second trip was three times the
speed of the first trip, and the speed of
the third trip was double that of the
second trip. If the average speed of all
trips was 30 m.p.h., find the speed of
each trip.

A man, who had three sons passed
away. In his will he directed that his
total cash should be divided among them,
except for a gift to the local hospital. He
had a mathematical turn of mind, and
after the will was made, he had worked
the matter out and found that if he made
the hospital gift to his eldest son, he
would then have as much as the other
two sons. But if he had given it to the
second son, he would then have twice
as much as the other two, while of he
had given it to the youngest son, he
would have three times as much as the
other two. Now, if the man left a total
of $1800, can you calculate how much
each son and the hospital received as
their share?

Dr. Edward Kasner, Professor of
Mathematics at Columbia University, has
introduced a new mathematical term
called the "googol." It is an extremely
large number. Do you know what it
equals?

Suppose you were outside the moat

the threat of compulsory membership in
a union. In equal counterbalance is the
charge that authentic representatives of
labor (this would probably include most
labor-unions but not necessarily) may call
upon workers to support unions out of a
sense of moral obligation.
As a result, the justification for right-
to-work laws reverts to the need to
combat "labor monopoly (wage infla-
tion) and corruption in labor."
A right-to-work law is a "topical rem-
edy applied by statesmen" the purpose
of which is intrinsically good but of
necessity narrower in its effect than the
evils it would cause, i.e., we should not
attack the security of the union move-
ment in order to remedy evils within a
portion of that movement. The right-to-
work laws will "... induce collateral
evils; and these often greater than the
original ones." When we admit a force
in society is for the common good, we
should not attack the entire force but,
rather, apply ourselves to the particular
evil in question.
The way to rid the labor movement of
corruption, then, is to use the judicial
processes that are intended to be used
for prosecution of corruption and law-
breaking. Compulsory union membership
when established by collective bargain-
ing in a company and upheld by the
Supreme Court certainly cannot be con-
sidered to be corrupt in itself and should
not be outlawed by legislation.
There is some question as to whether
the collective bargaining process will be
sufficient to keep labor unions from con-
tinuing to increase wages out of pro-
portion to productivity. Continued con-
fidence in collective bargaining and its
consequences is natural if one believes
that social action is dependant upon the
relative urgency of all the needs of so-
ciety. When society realizes, through the
well-developed communication media we
fortunately have in our country today,
that wage inflation is hurting us to a
major extent, that is, to an extent where
the "hurt" pierces enough of our shells
of security, we will collectively and dem-
ocratically arrive at a group policy that
will be in the manner of Taft-Hartley,
e.g., a register of public opinion and
sentiment."
Finally, with regard to compulsory
union membership, if labor monopoly
and its supposed facet, compulsory union
membership, are against the common
good—if it is shown that the power of
unions is too great to be countered by
management power, and this is truly
doubtful, such union power should be
made subject to judicial action in par-
ticular cases where the effects are most
harmful. This judicial action would prob-
ably set a precedent by overruling another
piece of legislative action, the Clayton
Act (1941) which protects labor unions
from anti-trust prosecution.
A Course of Action
The union shop should be a subject
solely for negotiation between labor and
management in individual companies
and, if established, should be a condi-
tion of employment.
When a worker is hired by a company,
he accepts certain conditions of employ-
ment. These conditions are provisions of
his agreement to work for the company
as well as the company's agreement to
hire the worker. Because many workers
already are required to donate to group
hospitalization funds, old-age pension
funds, and other similar reserves, it is
not unreasonable to expect him to agree,
as another condition of employment, that
after thirty days he will join the union.
This condition will be another factor an
individual must consider when he makes
the decision to work for a given com-
pany.
The element of compulsion is not a
unique feature of employment nor is it
unrealistic. A group without some ele-
ment of individual sacrifice or compul-
sion is an extremely rare social phenom-
enon.
Furthermore, if opponents of required
union membership would admit that the
union shop is necessary for the security
of a needed force in the economy, and the
advocates of required union membership
would admit that the union shop is not
needed in every existing company, the
settlement of differences would be logic-
ally and equitably defined.
We must realize that the solution does
not consist in a blanket right-to-work
law to be applied indiscriminately to all
of American industry. The solution lies
in the ability of each company to nego-
tiate a union shop proposal with its
union.

Westinghouse-proposed solar sail
may permit 60,000 mph speeds in space. s s
and it will need no fuel at all!
Lunar reconnaissance—and manned lunar colonies—may become realities
in the not-too-distant future.
But the exploration of deep space is entirely another matter. Distances
are tremendous—fuel requirements for chemical rockets are staggering—
navigation must be almost unbelievably precise.
As a partial answer to these problems, a Westinghouse scientist has
proposed the use of a solar sail which will harness the light of the sun. This
sail will require no fuel, it will be capable of fantastic speeds, and its design
will permit in-flight navigational corrections. More important, this West-
inghouse approach could be cheaper and simpler than any other system
proposed for this same purpose.

agement, the engineer has the advantage
over the domestic engineer. Of course,
the company expects the engineer to work
hard and to start repaying its investment
in him within a year to a year and a half.
Type of Employment
You, as an engineer, will be used in
technical positions much the same as you
would Stateside. The supervisory engin-
eering positions are staffed by men who
have started out as technicians and have
gained enough experience and knowledge
of the particular process to qualify as
supervisors. Engineers just out of college
or coming from basic company training
in America are assigned to the process
plants to plan and build new equipment,
maintain and supervise the present equip-
ment, and explore for raw materials.
Depending on his choice or marital
status, the engineer may work on explora-
tion, drilling, or mining crews for a few
months. Oil and minerals have the bad
habit of being located under remote
lakes or in dense jungles, and American
engineers are at a premium here. In
spite of the remoteness, if the deposit is
a large one, the company will establish
a camp with as many conveniences as
possible to offset the sometimes rugged
conditions of exploration crews.
As has been said before, the engineer
will most probably choose to work in a
domestic-type job when overseas. A few
engineers, trained in comparatively new
sciences such as nuclear or materials en-
gineering may immediately occupy a high
position, especially if the company is
lacking personnel trained along these
lines.
Salary Scales
In general, engineers employed over-
seas get slightly higher salaries than do-
mestic engineers, mainly because they are
well chosen and expected to show a
little more results than the domestic en-
gineer, and because of the slight drop
in living conditions, depending on loca-
tion. Some companies offer very good
wages, and expect much hard work and
odd working hours in return. Schlum-
berger, for instance, pays its field engin-
eers in Venezuela an average of $650 a
month for the first two years of service.
This is exclusive of housing, which is
supplied free in a company camp or cov-
ered in salary when outside living is
necessary.
The majority of overseas companies
pay a little higher than the same type of
company in America, the exact figure
depending on the type of work and the
individual company.
Next Month
IN THE MARCH TECHNIC:
Auto Strying—the future will be
even brighter than before for
the auto buyers.
Video Tape—electronic marvel
for TV reproduction.
Highways of Tomorrow—More
and better roads are in store
for tomorrow's motorist.
In addition, overseas companies give
very liberal vacations to American em-
ployees. Besides yearly vacations in the
particular country, it is customary for
the company to allow a three month va-
cation in the United States after three
years of service, with the company pay-
ing for the transportation.
American engineers employed over-
seas generally retain more of their salary
than do domestic engineers. After resi-
dence in the particular foreign country
for more than eighteen months, the en-
gineer only has to pay income tax to the
resident country, which is seldom higher
than that in America and usually very
much lower.
Cost of Moving and Establishing
Companies with overseas branches,
once they have gone to the trouble and
expense of screening the many job appli-
cants and have chosen the few suitable
ones, want to make sure that the new em-
ployee is satisfied with the company and
has to make no great sacrifice in moving
from the United States. As a consequence,
the company will pay the costs for travel,
within reason, from the United States
and will give a liberal allowance for per-
sonal belongings and furniture. This is
especially true if the engineer has a fam-
ily. In addition to these benefits, the com-
pany will do much to see that the engin-
eer (and his family) get settled immedi-
ately. The less time that the American
engineer takes to establish himself, the
sooner he will begin to repay the com-
pany's investment.
Living Conditions
Many factors decide the living condi-
tions of overseas personnel. The two most
important are the degree of development
of the country, and the location of the
engineer's job. Since the engineer will
most likely be hired by a large oil or
mineral firm, his living conditions will
practically be the same as in the United
States. Large processing plants must lo-
cate near ample power, manpower, and
transportation sources, which demand a
closeness to a large town or city. How-
ever, some large towns have grown and
developed as a result of a large plant
and its personnel.
Creole, a division of Standard Oil in
Venezuela, has been in operation since
1920 and now encompasses an enormous
amount of land and equipment. The
wells and refineries deal with literally
millions of barrels of oil per day, and
the capital poured into the company has
caused an economic boom in that part of
Venezuela. All the features of American
living have come to the towns near the
sites and to the company-built towns for
the American and advanced national em-
ployee. Supermarkets, the latest Holly-
wood and European movies, modern

electric conveniences, and modern schools
are some of the many conveniences avail-
able.
Many other companies of considerably
less scope have furnished homes with
water, electricity, heat, and many other
domestic conveniences. Some conveniences
are lacking, but an American engineer
realizes this when he accepts a position
with an overseas firm. Many times the
rewards of the foreign job offset the lack
of some comforts of home.
Living conditions are quite a bit differ-
ent in the field at mining, drilling, and
exploration sites. The company responsi-
ble has erected housing for the engineers
and employees, but the Engineer must
be prepared for the lack of many con-
veniences in the field. Sometimes, the re-
moteness of the site allows transportation
only by boat or helicopter, which further
cuts back on the conveniences. Living
conditions are clean, however, and the
food is good.
Rent will usually be higher in foreign
countries than in America, but most com-
panies make allowances for this extra
expense in the salary. In addition, a
"cost of living" bonus is added by com-
panies to offset the high cost of living in
some countries.
In summary, foreign employment offers
many opportunities to the American en-
gineer if he is suited to the job. Com-
panies stress the cultural advantage and
opportunity for an education in foreign
employment, as well as the opportunity
for advancement and a rewarding job.
But at the same time, companies stress
the point that foreign employment, while
offering many cultural advantages, is a
little more demanding than a domestic
job, and that the engineer must start to
return the company's investment as soon
as possible.
If you wouldn't have much trouble in
making a break with the United States
for a few years, are willing to work, and
would like some exposure to other ways
of life, foreign employment may be just
the thing for you.

Westinghouse Astronautics Institute
now probing basic problems
of interplanetary travel
It was a wise man who first said, "A problem well defined is half solved."
Space exploration is no exception to this rule. Many of the complex
activities at Cape Canaveral and our other missile test sites are devoted to
better denning the problems involved in space flight.
Westinghouse, for its part, has established an Astronautics Institute to
investigate such matters as space craft stabilization, orbital injection, space
guidance and communications, the equipment needs of a manned lunar
colony, etc. This Westinghouse group has already made significant con-
tributions toward a better understanding of space problems. It has also
developed a number of solutions.

lie lithium, characteristics of beta and
gamma radiation, and the separation of
radioactive isotopes. Experiments of this
caliber are rarely encountered in "tra-
ditional" engineering laboratories before
the senior year.
Depth As Well As Perspective
As was mentioned, the engineer must
have some depth, as well as perspective.
With this in mind, we can see that the
electives in engineering should include
a professional sequence, composed by
the student with the aid of a faculty ad-
visor, designed to satisfy the special inter-
ests of the student. This sequence must
be an integrated sequence, and it must
include at least one course in analysis or
design. All prerequisite courses are pro-
vided in the engineering science sequence
during the first two years, so that the
professional sequences need only include
the most important subject matter from
the particular specialization.
Inasmuch as the "humanities and the
social sciences" have already been referred

to a number of times, we should define
these terms before discussing them fur-
ther. The "humanities" primarily include
literature, languages, philosophy, and
history. The "social sciences" include
anthropology, economics, geography, po-
litical science, psychology, and sociology.
For want of better terminology, it is
said that "engineers are deficient in 'cul-
ture,' therefore they should take a speci-
fied number of hours of 'non-technical'
courses to become 'cultured.'" Quite
often the purpose of these courses is not
clear to the student or the faculty advisor,
and it is therefore not served.
As was pointed out by a member of
the Science Engineering Committee, these
courses actually serve two purposes.
First, the student is made aware of the
variety of intellectual endeavor and meth-
ods in fields other than his own. Second,
he learns to appreciate the possibility of
intangible and unmeasurable elements,
to recognize the shades of meaning in
spoken and written communication, and
to appreciate that these elements very
often enter into important decisions.
Again, this is a necessary part of the
education of an engineer who may some-
day be in a management position.
The student's electives in the socio-
humanistic fields should consist of more
than survey type courses, so that he has
an opportunity to formulate a first hand
appraisal of the reasoning employed by
the men who developed these "different"
fields of knowledge. Moreover, the stu-
dent should express this appraisal in
expository form to acquire a concept of
the problems involved. Study in a reason-
ably well defined area should allow the
student to obtain a working knowledge
of the subject.

ence Engineering program, although one
natural objection has been that a number
of informative subjects have had to be
dropped from courses: e.g., friction,
simple machines, shear modulus, and
pumps have been eliminated from Physics
53, although some of these subjects are
picked up later in other courses.
Again using Physics 53 (a first semes-
ter course) as an example, it is to be
noted that calculus is used as the basic
framework for all analysis, whereas tra-
ditional first semester physics courses
treat calculus as a supplementary aspect,
if at all. The remarkable results of this
procedure have caused a member of the
physics department to state that, "The
teaching of calculus in the context of phy-
sical topics has . . .resulted in a better stu-
dent appreciation of both disciplines than
we have ever before observed. This aspect
of the course has not, in our opinion,
been difficult for the students."
"Students reaction has been enthusias-
tic, though they regard the course as
difficult ..." and it is therefore a
course that the faculty can enjoy teach-
ing."
"It has been a success because we are
watching other courses, as well as our
own, with more than usual care."
When the first Science Engineer grad-
uates from the University of Michigan
this June, he may well consider himself
to be the forerunner of a new era in
engineering education. The need for this
engineer has been established; only time
will tell how well he has been prepared
for the position which he must fill. If his
enthusiasm is a measure of his success,
he will be justified.

Westinghouse develops new skin
for space craft... so they won't burn up
re-entering earth's atmosphere
At 6,000 mph, air friction is a problem for space craft re-entering earth's
atmosphere, because skin temperatures can exceed 2,500°F. Without ade-
quate thermal protection, the incoming space vehicle will burn itself up
like a meteor.
Westinghouse has developed a new ablative material for use as the pro-
tecting outer skin for space craft. It has already been service-proven in
actual re-entry tests involving firings of ballistic missiles equipped with
nose cones of this material.
This new Westinghouse development should do much to help advance
our nation's space exploration effort.

METEOROLOGY... a potpourri
edited by BOB RUSNAK, '60E
Although the meteorological program
here at the University is a baby
compared to such granddaddies as the
civil and mechanical engineering pro-
grams, there is much interesting research
work being carried on through this de-
partment. Students may think that this
department is restricted to weather fore-
casting. Meteorological research, how-
ever, covers a much more extensive scope.
Descriptions of several meteorlogical
projects are printed here to give the
student an idea of the variety of re-
search being carried on by the depart-
ment.
Study of Contaminant Dispersal
The United States has developed a
growing concern over air polution and
its effect on public health. Coupled with
this concern is the desire of many manu-
facturers to minimize the ground level
concentrations of stack effluents. These
manufacturers call on the meteorologist
to specify dispersion patterns and diffu-
sion conditions so that air pollution may
be minimized by releasing the contain-
ments when conditions are poor for
wide-spread dispersion.
One of the near future sources of air
pollution will be the atomic power plant.
The atomic reactors in these plants may
emit radioactive materials from time to
time. It is, therefore, essential that the
meteorologists study the diffusion pat-
terns at the sites of these atomic power
plants.
Late in 1956, the University of Michi-
gan announced a program of meteor-
ological measurement and analysis at the
atomic power plant being built near
Monroe, Michigan and the shores of
Lake Erie. This study is imperative not
only for the sake of United States public
health but also for the sake of our
friendly neighbor, Canada, which borders
Lake Erie.
The Power Reactor Development Com-
pany is currently sponsoring two research
projects with the Meterological Labora-
tory of the University of Michigan. The
first of these consists of the gathering
and analyzing of meteorological infor-
mation at the plant site. Through the
use of 100 foot towers located within
50 feet of the Lake Erie shore, enough
data has been collected and analyzed so
that the climatology of the site has been
well established for the past two years.
The second project involves the study
of diffusion patterns in the western end
of Lake Erie and in the area surrounding
the reactor. Initial measurements are to
be taken this fall. Fluorescent particles
are to be released and two aircraft will
be used to sample the air. The planes'
positions will be determined by their
altimeters and the radar sets located at
the site.
The information obtained from this
study will be used to determine periods
of good and bad diffusion so that the
health physicist at the plant will know
when to release the radioactive material
for minimum air pollution.
Snow Studies
The strategic importance of the north-
ern wastes has put the problem of travel
over large expanses of snow in the spot-
light. This problem is attacked through
the study of the physical characteristics
of the snow, especially those relating to
its bearing strength. The physical prop-
erties of the snow are dependent on
meteorological conditions and the ther-
mal character of the underlying earth.
Data for the study of snow character-
istics is obtained at the United States
Army Keewenaw Field Station in north-
ern Michigan. Measurements are made
of incident and reflected solar radiation
and the interchange of infrared radiation
between the atmosphere and the snow
surface. Conduction of heat from the
underlying soil is determined by direct
measurement and by analysis of soil
temperature and thermal properties. Also,
measurements are made of density grain
size and other properties.
The results in this project tend to sub-
stantiate similar findings by the Russians
in Siberia and the Scandinavians in Ant-
artica.
Raindrop Size
The importance of radar in our na-
tion's defense makes the study of condi-
tions which hamper its effectiveness im-
perative. The weakening of a radar echo
is a function of the raindrop-size distri-
bution. Thus, the measurement of the
size distribution will furnish advance in-
formation on the capabilities of radar
on a given night.
An instrument used for this measure-
ment is the raindrop spectrometer. The
spectrometer consists of two basic com-
ponents, a light source giving a colli-
mated beam of light and a photometer
which views a certain portion of this
beam. The rotation of these components
increases the field considerably. As the
beam sweeps past a raindrop, a certain
portion of the light scattered by the drop
is received by the phototube, the amount
of scattered light received being propor-
tional to the drop size. The signals
from the phototube are amplified and
fed into a bank of electronic counters
which then record the number of drops
in given size ranges.

Westinghouse designs power plant
for the moon to provide electricity
for man's first space colony
Lunar explorations are no longer the mere dream of a few. Dedicated men
all over the world are now actively at work on lunar projects. The first
reconnaissance space craft have been launched.
Westinghouse, as part of its effort in the area of space technology, has
already designed and demonstrated a practical power plant for use by
man's first space colony on the moon. This Westinghouse plant will be very
lightweight and compact to facilitate its transport, and it will produce a
substantial quantity of electricity from the rays of the sun.

tion of rockets in solar research has been
the short space of time they have had
to record data. Placing a large rocket in
stable orbit high above the earth, which
now looks possible, will give the astron-
omer an "unobstructed view of the uni-
verse," he said.
American astronomers were far from
shocked by Russia's early lead in the
field of satellites, the U-M scientist said.
"However, even our scientists were taken
aback by the enormous sizes of the Rus-
sian Sputniks.
"The initial shock has now worn off
and has been replaced by eager antici-
pation of the consequences for astronomy
of artificial satellites that can carry several
thousand pounds of scientific equipment
into orbits hundreds of miles above the
surface of the earth."
Our sun—-"the most important star in
the sky—should have the highest priority
for investigation from satellites," Gold-
berg said, because:
1. The sun is such an intense source
of radiation that instrumental problems
are at a minimum;
2. The influence of the sun upon earth
is of "very great interest to geophysicists,
and meteorologists as well as astronomers;
3. Observations from the ground dur-
ing the past have clearly defined goals
of satellite research.
"Solar activity initiates various events
on the earth, chiefly in the upper atmos-
phere, and hence its study has very im-
portant practical consequences for the
human race," he said.
"To comprehend the physical nature
of (the sun) and to understand the
causes of disturbances to the earth's at-
mosphere, it is necessary to observe
directly the ultraviolet radiation that is
now screened from observation by the
earth's atmosphere," Goldberg declared.
Atom Fuel Life
One of the nuclear industry's most
serious roadblocks is its dependence on
theoretical calculations to determine re-
actor behavior under actual operating
conditions. The Babcock &amp; Wilcox Com-
pany expects to place this phase of power
reactor technology on firmer ground
through the use of a combined research
and test reactor and "hot exponential"
facility which the firm began operating
at its Critical Experiment Laboratory.
The new unit, according to Company
spokesmen, will provide industry with a
means of determining accurately how
reactor cores will behave at operating
temperatures. In the past, they said,
reactor behavior for these conditions has
been determined by calculations based on
experiments at room temperature. Now,
with this new facility, the first of its
kind in the country, reactor characteris-
tics at high temperatures can be measured.
Designed and engineered by the B&amp;W
Atomic Energy division's physicists and
engineering staff, the research reactor
will be operated at a nominal power of
10 KW. The reactor, however, is capable
of powers up to approximately 200 KW.
It will serve primarily as a neutron
source for test which will be conducted
in the exponential facility. The reactor
pool, essentially an open concrete shell
7 by 13 by 18 feet, will be filled with
highly purified, demineralized water.
The reactor will also be employed for
reactor physics experiments, neutron
beam experiments, reactivity testing, and
nuclear quality control of materials.
The core, located at the same end of
the pool as the exponential facility, will
consist of an upright assembly of 16
plate-type fuel elements of uranium-
aluminum alloy containing 30 per cent
by weight of enriched uranium.
The exponential facility is essentially
a pressure vessel, 3 feet in inside diam-
eter by 9 feet long. It is designed to
duplicate reactor operating temperature
and pressure conditions. A hydraulically-
operated, quick-opening door at the
outer end permits rapid and frequent
access to the test assemblies inside the
vessel both for prompt removal of test-
ing equipment and rearrangement of core
assemblies.
During test operations, B&amp;W officials
explained, a sub-critical assembly of fuel
rods is placed in the vessels together
with wires which record the neutron dis-
tribution along the axis of the fuel rods.
The vessel is then filled with water. An
external heater and pressurizer produce
operating conditions up to 500 degrees
Fahrenheit and 720 pounds per square
inch of pressure. The adjacent reactor
serves as a neutron source for the test
assembly. A boral gate minimizes re-
acticity coupling between the reactor and
the assembly under test.
After the wires have been exposed to
neutron bombardment within the assem-
bly, they are removed and their radio-
activity is measured on the automatic
scanning device to determine both the
radial and longitudinal neutron flux dis-
tribution throughout the assembly. The
neutron distribution is known to fall off
exponentially along the axis of the as-
sembly, giving rise to the name "expo-
nential facility."
Believed to be the first commercial
installation of its kind in the nuclear
industry, a Teleflex wire activator system,
based on a design by Knolls Atomic
Power Laboratory, is a vital part of the
exponential facility. Neutron flux meas-
urements at high temperatures and pres-
ures are now possible without the re-
quirement for first lowering the tempera-
ture or opening the exponential facility
door to remove test material.
As utilized by B&amp;W, the Teleflex
system consists of a drive mechanism
which directs 8 dysprosium-aluminum
wires, .020" in diameter and encased in
hollow titanium flexible cables, into stain-
less steel conduits leading into the ex-
ponential facility.
Following a predetermined exposure to
neutron bombardment from the reactor
core, the cables are withdrawn and the
exposed wires removed. The wires are
then attached to a 27-inch diameter
power-driven wheel or "scanning drum."
An electronic timer rotates the aluminum
drum and causes it to stop for a pre-
determined time for "counting" purposes.
A scintillation detector measures the
gamma radiation emitted by the wires.
A digital printer translates the impulses
either on tape or on an IBM card punch
system. Reactor operating test conditions
are thus automatically classified for sub-
sequent analysis by R&amp;W nuclear physi-
cists with an electronic computer.
The new reactor and hot exponential
facility unit is housed in a newly con-
structed bay of the Critical Experiment
Laboratory, the first such laboratory to
be licensed by the Atomic Energy Com-
mission and built entirely with private
funds.

Westinghouse is the best place
for talented engineers
The preceding four advertisements have only touched upon Westing-
house activities related to space. Some of the other projects in this area
include the investigation of electronic and mechanical phenomena in
high vacuums, work with special metals, and the development of various
devices for satellite reconnaissance purposes. There are also a number of
highly-classified projects.
The wide variety of engineering and scientific work at Westinghouse
demands the services of really talented engineers. This diversity of oppor-
tunity is one of the biggest reasons why so many outstanding engineers
have chosen Westinghouse over the years, and the variety of work being
done today is greater than it has ever been before. Guided missile con-
trols, atomic power, automation, radar, semi-conductors, and large
power equipment are only a few of the other fascinating career fields to
be found at Westinghouse.

uses.
tures near 800 degrees. But later work
proved that, although semi-conductors
show great promises for refrigeration,
their efficiency drops too low at high
temperatures to be useful in power gen-
eration.
Recently Westinghouse Research Labo-
ratories have been doing considerable
work on materials that may be usable
at much higher temperatures. In the early
fifties, Dr. Clarence Zener, director of
the laboratories, proposed a new theory
concerning the atomic structure of the
so-called transition metals (ones lying
near the center of the periodic table) and
including such metals as manganese, iron,
copper, and nickel. Early work on this
theory led Westinghouse scientists to be-
lieve that certain compounds of these
transition metals might have unusual
thermoelectric properties. Later experi-
ments proved them right and develop-
ment work on these metals is continuing.
Already the efficiency obtainable with
these materials is about 10% and may
soon reach the 20-30% range. Some of
these materials will probably be used for
power generation at temperatures near
2,000 degrees.
Of course, in some cases a 30% effi-
ciency is not a minimum requirement for
commercial use because the cost of steam
electric equipment (furnace, condenser,
boiler, dynamo) may make it more profit-
able to use a 10 or 15% efficient thermo-
electric setup (which requires only a
heater and a cooler).
Of course, these are just a few of the
problems and the work being done on
them. A great deal of work still must be
done, but scientists the world over are
now beginning to break through the

Vought offers this range
to the young engineer
At Chance Vought the engineer's assign-
ments range from the depths of the ocean to
the farthest reaches of space ... from hard-
ware operating aboard the Navy's nuclear-
armed submarines to space research vehicles
still on the boards.
Here the engineer contributes to projects
such as the record-smashing Crusader jet
fighter series . .. the Regulus missiles .. .
and advanced weapons, details of which are
still classified.
Under the guidance of the Vought engi-
neer, such weapons take shape. He super-
vises critical tests, and he introduces the
weapons to the men with whom they
will serve.
Engineers with many specialties share these
experiences. Today, for example, Vought is
at work on important projects involving:
SPACECRAFT AND ASTRONAUTICS
ADVANCED PROPULSION METHODS
ELECTRONICS DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE
ANTISUBMARINE WARFARE
Vought's excellent R&amp;D facilities help the
engineer through unexplored areas. And by
teaming up with other specialists against
mutual challenges, the Vought engineer
learns new fields while advancing in his twn.

Exciting Careers at Chance Vought
Outer space and ocean depths present a tremendous
challenge to young engineers. Deep space and deep
water are becoming new avenues of attack, and con-
sequently broad studies are now going on at Chance
Vought for safeguarding these approaches with
advanced weapons systems.
Toward space security, Vought's propulsion specialists
are analyzing nuclear and ionic power. Astronautics
design teams are studying crew quarters for spacemen
and devices for escape from orbit... drawing on the
near-space cockpit and capsule experience of Vought's
Crusader fighter developers.
Earth's ocean basins, too, are potential theaters of war.
Under the Office of Naval Research, Vought engineers

are seeking improved ways of detecting and identifying
the submarine — a weapon they know well. Since 1953,
U. S. Fleet subs have carried Regulus missiles and
support equipment.
Engineers of all academic specialties can find at
Vought an unmatched career area... as new capabil-
ities are forged ... weapons for deep water and deep
space defense.

START TODAY TO
PLAN TOMORROW
By knowing about some of the projects underway at the
Babcock &amp; Wilcox Company, an engineer may see his
personal avenues of growth and advancement. For today
B&amp;W stands poised at a new era of expansion and
development.
Here's an indication of what's going on at B&amp;W, with
the consequent opportunities that are opening up for
engineers. The Boiler Division is building the world's
largest steam generator. The Tubular Products Division
recently introduced extruded seamless titanium tubing,
one result of its metallurgical research. The Refractories
Division developed the first refractory concrete that will
withstand temperatures up to 3200 F. The Atomic Energy
Division is under contract by the AEC to design and
build the propulsion unit of the world's first nuclear-
powered cargo vessel.
These are but a few of the projects — not in the plan-
ning stage, but in the actual design and manufacturing
phases — upon which B&amp;W engineers are now engaged.
The continuing, integrated growth of the company offers
engineers an assured future of leadership.
How is the company doing right now? Let's look at one

"THE COED"
Between the sincerity of old age and
discrimination of chilhood there is a
strange and uncanny age of the "coed".
Coeds come in assorted sizes, weights,
shapes and colors. They can be found
everywhere—-inciting panty raids, read-
ing the latest edition of True Confession,
and bragging about that date with the
campus hero they wish they could get.
A coed is exotic with mascara on her
eye lashes, demureness in a sweater, and
"the future homemaker" with a can op-
ener. A coed is composite—she is as
funny as a train wreck, as modest as
Lady Godiva, as subtle as a kick in the
pants, has the taste of "pheasant under
glass" and when she wants something, it
is usually a date. Who else can talk
more and say less? She is as cunning as
a rattlesnake, as meek as a tiger and as
graceful as a giraffe.
She likes flattery, champagne, big cars,
wedding rings, windy street corners, her
roommate's clothes, and boys—anytime.
She is leery of cheap dates, house moth-
ers, western movies, hilbilly music,
work, and other girls. Nobody else can
cram into one little billfold a complete
picture album, 5 recent love letters, a
box of Kleenex, her boy friend's car
keys, 8 safety pins and a flashlight for
emergency on dates, a comb, bobby pins,
one crushed corsage, a record of "Band
of Gold," and one "I Go Pogo" button.
After 4 long years of faithful com-
panionship during which she has accumu-
lated your ring, your "Hall-hockey"
sweater, your Tapa Keg Ada pin, your
autographed picture of Roy Acuff, and
all your contract checks, you receive

Triptane, whose formula is shown above, represents
one of the most important challenges in petroleum re-
search. Although oil companies have been working
with this valuable gasoline anti-knock component for
15 years, no method for low-cost commercial produc-
tion has yet been developed.
We don't have all the answers...yet!
We already know quite a bit about triptane,
whose formula is shown in the picture. It is a
branched heptane. Scientists at Standard Oil's
laboratories can tell you that its octane num-
ber is 113. It is one of the best gasoline ingre-
dients ever discovered.
As far back as 15 years ago, triptane could
be produced in tank truck quantities. But no
one has yet developed a large volume commer-
cial method of making this valuable material.
Triptane represents but one of the creative
research challenges that exist in the oil indus-
try. A commercial way to make cyclopentane,
another anti-knock material, ranks high on the
list of unsolved problems. The same is true of
certain hydrogenated polymethyl naphtha-
lenes; their high energy content and low pour-
point make them ideal for jet fuel.
At Standard Oil, young scientists and engi-
neers have the opportunity to help solve im-
portant problems such as these. Here they can
use their skills and knowledge to build satis-
fying, lifetime careers.

to land America's first jet airliner
YOU see above the axles of the Boeing 707—
America's first jet airliner. They have to be tough.
A cross-wind landing could put the whole landing im-
pact of this 122-ton plane on one wheel—instead of
eight. And these axles have to be light. Manufacturers
of the 707's landing gear had built landing gears for
dozens of other models using an analysis of seamless
steel tubing specially developed by the Timken Com-
pany. But to be strong enough for the much heavier
707, the steel would have to be cleaner. Any impurities
in the finished part would cause its rejection. Timken
Company metallurgists said the steel could be made
clean enough for the 707. And it was—met highest
specifications, stood up to the terrific landing impacts.
Timken steels have solved the toughest steel prob-
lems. Problems that you may face in your future job in
industry. Our metallurgists will be ready to help you.

ported" by automobile from the Argonne
National Laboratory near Chicago by E.
E. Westrum, Associate Professor of
Chemistry. Its importation involved very
rigorous insulation since the liquid was
very easily vaporized and was also quite
expensive. However, in 1954, a Collins
Helium Cryostat was installed in the
Chemistry Building and today is capable
of producing four liters of helium liquid
per hour.
Measurement of Heat Capacities
One other problem in low temperature
research is the measurement of the speci-
fic heat or heat capacity of substances.
These values give the quantity of heat
required to raise the temperature of a unit
mass of the substance one degree of tem-
perature. Though the heat capacity for an
ideal gas or a monotic solid approximate-
ly equals six calories per degree, for most
substances it is a function of the temper-
ature. It may vary from zero at absolute
zero (predicted by the Third Law of
Thermodynamics) to values above 6 cal-
ories per degree at quite high tempera-
tures. Precise values of the heat capacity
are necessary over the entire temperature
range, both low and high, if one is to
tell how this particular substance would
react with other substances.
Values for the heat capacity at any
temperature may be calculated from a
third power law known as the Debye
Law, also, values down to 20 degrees
Kelvin could be plotted and the curve
could be extrapolated back to zero de-
grees. However, for quite precise values,
experiments are usually conducted at the
low temperatures using a vacuum calori-
meter.
In the University of Michigan labora-
tories, liquid helium is employed to cool
the substances down to the desired tem-
perature. Moreover, the helium is also
kept cool by liquid nitrogen. With such
an arrangement, the substance or appara-
tus can be cooled to 4.2 degrees Kelvin.
A few grams of the substance are first
sealed in a gold calorimeter and placed
in a calorimetric cryostat containing the
helium. The temperature of the calori-
meter and its contents is then recorded
by a precision thermometer that can mea-
sure temperature changes to 0.0001 de-

Metallurgy is both a science and a field of engineering. It begins with a study of atoms and atomic
bonding to give the student a basic understanding of the source of metallic properties. The crystal struc-
tures and the properties of metals are then investigated. Finally the production and development of new
metals and alloys for all industry are explored.
For the student with an interest in chemistry or physics, metallurgy offers a variety of challenging
problems. There is a great shortage of metallurgists and a continually mounting backlog of new frontiers
to explore.
In 1958, just over 1% of the total engineering graduates were metallurgical engineers. By contrast 1570
of American industry is basically metallurgical, including products sjch as steel, aluminum, magnesium,
titanium and nickel. However, less than half of the graduates entered these traditional metallurgical
fields because of the tremendous demand for their services in the aircraft, automotive, and electronic
industries.
For students desiring to add metallurgy to their present field of engineering combined programs are
arranged.

grees. A known quantity of heat is then
put into the system and the change in
temperature is noted.
Data Tells Procedure of Reaction
From the above measurements and
data, the heat capacity of the substance
in the calorimeter is determined after
correction for the heat capacity of the
calorimeter. Thus knowing the heat ca-
pacity of the reactants and products at
any temperature, the enthalpy, entropy,
and the free energy of the reaction can
be calculated. These three factors then
tell just how the reaction will proceed.
The probability of a reaction proceeding
depends upon whether or not energy is
given off and this energy is related to the
thermodynamic term, enthalpy. Entropy
is the randomness that a substance is
under any laboratory conditions (sub-
stances tend toward greater random con-
ditions). Free energy tells whether the
reaction will go at the desired laboratory
conditions of temperature and pressure.
Thus from low temperature experiments
in heat capacity, it is possible to deter-
mine not only the lowest temperature at
which a reaction will proceed, but also
what the ideal conditions would be for
that reaction.
Though there are many problems that
are being worked out and using low
temperatures, it was the discovery of
helium in a liquid phase that enabled
all such experiments to be conducted
below 4 degrees Kelvin. Future work in
this field will probably be determined if
there are any reactions which could take
place at extremely low temperatures to
give a high yield of some substance. If
this particular substance was hard to pro-
duce at ordinary temperatures, the above
reaction would provide a more economical
source.

than just the size of the FISH
and the size of the POND
We've been told that an engineering graduate is frequently attracted to
companies our size because of his understandable human desire to be "a big
fish in a little pond".
While it is true that (numerically speaking) our employee team is small
compared to some, we encounter great difficulty in trying to think of Sikorsky
Aircraft as a "little pond". Our contributions to the field of rotary-winged
aircraft have not been small, nor can our field be considered limited or pro-
fessionally confining. Quite the contrary. Sikorsky Aircraft is the company
which pioneered the modern helicopter; and our field today is recognized as
one of the broadest and most challenging in the entire aircraft industry.
And what of the size of the "fish"?
Unquestionably, that is a matter involving your own indi-
vidual potential for growth. Like any far-sighted company,
we're always willing to talk with "young whales"!

I AM AN ENGINEER. In my profession I take pride, but without vain-
glory; to it I owe solemn obligations that I am eager to fulfill.
As an Engineer, I will participate in none but honest enterprise. To
him that has engaged my services, as employer or client, I will give the ut-
most of performance and fidelity.
When needed, my skill and knowledge shall be given without reser-
vation for the public good. From special capacity springs the obligation to
use it well in the service of humanity; and I accept the challenge that this
implies.
Jealous of the high repute of my calling, I will strive to protect the
interests and the good name of any engineer that I know to be deserving;
but I will not shrink, should duty dictate from disclosing the truth regard-
ing anyone that, by unscrupulous act, has shown himself worthy of the
profession.
Since the Age of Stone, human progress has been conditioned by the
genius of my profesional forbears. By them have been rendered usable to
mankind Nature's vast resources of material and energy. By them have
been visualized and turned to practical account the principles of science and
the revelations of technology. Except for this heritage of accumulated ex-
perience, my efforts would be feeble. I dedicate myself to the dissemina-
tion of engineering profession in all its arts and traditions.
To my fellows I pledge, in the same full measure I ask of them, in-
tegrity and fair dealing, tolerance, and respect, and devotion to the stan-
dards and the dignity of our profession; with the consciousness, always,
that our special expertness carries with it the obligation to serve humanity
with complete sincerity.

Photography teams with electronics and adds
new certainty to flight
Now a visual computer pictures a plane's
precise position and heading on projected
photos of aeronautical maps.
Arma Division, American Bosch Arma Corp.,
working with the Air Navigation Development
Board and C.A.A., has developed a valuable new
aid in air navigation using photography.
With it the pilot, high above the weather, flicks
a switch and before him appears a map of the area
he's over. On the screen a tiny shadow of a plane
moves and shows exactly where he is, where he's
heading and whether he's on course.
This spells added certainty. Even more! It can
mean savings in time and money, too. For the
flight can proceed by plan rather than by dog-legs
on the beams.
So again we see photography at work helping
to improve operations—doing it for commercial
aviation just as it does for manufacturing and
distribution.
Photography works in many ways for all kinds
of business, large and small. It is saving time,
saving money, bettering methods.

to explore . . .
Teaching—
A Career Opportunity
For the Engineer
Leading educators, statesmen and in-
dustrialists throughout the country are
greatly concerned with the current
shortage of high-caliber graduates who
are seriously considering a career in the
field of science or engineering educa-
tion. Consequently, General Electric has
taken this opportunity to explore, with
one of America's eminent educators, the
opportunities and rewards teaching of-
fers the scientific or engineering student.
Q. Is there in fact a current and con-
tinuing need for educators in technical
colleges and universities?
A. Colleges and universities providing
scientific and engineering educational
opportunities are hard pressed at the
present moment to obtain the services
of a sufficient number of well-qualified
teachers to adequately carry out their
programs. Projected statistical studies
show that this critical need could ex-
tend over the next 15 or 20 years.
Q. Why is this need not being met?
A. There are probably three main rea-
sons. These might be classed under con-
ditions of financial return, prestige as-
sociated with the position, and lack
of knowledge and understanding on the
part of the college student of the ad-
vantages and rewards teaching as a
career can afford.
Q. What steps have been taken to make
education a more attractive field to en-
gineering students?
A. Steps are being taken in all areas.
For example, we have seen a great deal
in the newspapers relating educators'
salaries to the importance of the job
they are doing. Indications are that
these efforts are beginning to bear fruit.
Greater professional stature is being
achieved as the general public under-
stands that the youth of our nation is
the most valuable natural resource that
we possess . . . and that those associated
with the education of this youth have
one of the most important assignments
in our country today.
Q. Aside from salary, what rewards can
a career in education offer as opposed
to careers in government or industry?
A. The principal rewards might be free-
dom to pursue your own ideas within
the general framework of the school, in
teaching, research and consulting activ-
ities. As colleges and universities are
normally organized, a man has three
months in the summer time to engage
in activities of his own choice. In addi-
tion, the educator is in direct contact
with students and he has the satisfac-
tion of seeing these students develop
under his direction ... to see them take
important positions in local and na-
tional affairs.
Q. What preparation should an en-
gineering student undertake for a teach-
ing career?
A. In college, the engineering student
should obtain a basic understanding of
science, engineering science, humanities
and social sciences with some applica-
tions in one or more professional en-
gineering areas. He should have fre-
quent career discussions with faculty
members and his dean. During graduate
work, a desirable activity, the student
should have an opportunity to do some
teaching.
Q. Must an engineering student obtain
advanced degrees before he can teach?
A. It is not absolutely necessary. On the
other hand, without advanced degrees,
advancement in the academic world
would be extremely difficult.
O. How valuable do you feel industrial
experience is to an engineering or scien-
tific educator?
A. Industrial experience for a science


educator is desirable; however, with a
senior engineering educator, industrial
experience is a "must". An ideal en-
gineering educator should have had
enough industrial experience so that he
understands the problems and responsi-
bilities in carrying a project from its
formative stages to successful comple-
tion, including not only the technical
aspects, but the economic and personal
relationships also.
Q. What do you consider to be the op-
timum method by which an educator can
obtain industrial experience?
A. There are many methods. After
completion of graduate school, perhaps
the most beneficial is a limited but in-
tensive work period in industry. Con-
sulting during an academic year or
summer is a helpful activity and is
desirable for older members of the
staff. Younger educators usually need
experience in "living with the job"
rather than providing consultant's ad-
vice to the responsible individual.
Q. Based on your experience, what per-
sonal characteristics are possessed by
successful professors?
A. Primarily, successful professors have
an excellent and growing knowledge of
their subjects, are interested in people,
and transmit enthusiasm. They have an
ability to explain and impart informa-
tion with ease. They generate ideas and
carry them out because they are de-
voted to developing their fields of
knowledge. They desire personal free-
dom and action.

Communication Precedes Success
What are the statics that you, the student en-
gineer, can sit down and write a successful com-
munication on the first try? Not very high are they?
Well, don't let it bother you; not every student
can. But of course, you might as well consider your-
self as "run of the mill." Does that nomenclature
knock your ego; if it does, now is the time to do
something about it.
The engineer is a practitioner; he has to put the
knowledge of science into a workable product. Any
worth-while industry pays and advances their en-
gineers on the merit system, (i.e., the engineer is
paid for what he produces, not how smart he is).
You, the student engineer, should recognize this
fact early in your career and begin to develope your
efficency in writing communications, reports, papers,
etc., or you will be doomed to be that run of the
mill engineer.
Before you go any further in your thoughts of
improving your writing ability, regress in history
for just a second. Your profession is very young; the
College of Engineering was only founded in 1895—
engineering can hardly be over a hundred years old.
Engineering is only an infant compared to law and
medicine, and yet one could say that it is more
specialized than either of these two put together.
Specialization means that the student must devote
the major part of his college life to his field of study,
leaving no time to broaden himself to a "well
rounded engineer," as the Dean recently put it. But
one must recognize the fact that the University
is not helping the student any in the respect that it
still thinks that the engineer can obtain a well-
rounded' education in four years, which is far short
of any other specialized profession. Therefore, the
student must recognize the shortcomings of our
society and learn how to cope above them.
Now back to communication and how to better
one's talents at it. How does an engineer improve
his communication skills? The answer lies all
around you. In fact, that is the answer; your very
environment is a wealth of education, just waiting
to be plucked. Everyday, there are countless papers,
reports, technical journals, lectures, etc. that are
given and available to you so that you may scrutin-
ize them and learn from the talents of their authors,
methods of presentation, delivery, and even facts
about other fields.
You may now be asking of yourself the question
of how can being prepared for communication help
you in your field. Consider the following analogy.
Often in his work, an engineer must cope with
problems that are completely outside his own field
and with which he has no familiarity. Progress on
the work is completely stopped, unless the en-
gineer can get outside help. Communication is the
only alternative, and assuming the engineer has
been aware of his environment, he will immediately
know where to direct his communication and just
how to present the problem so that it is clearly
understood. Thus, the work can again proceed on
to completion, landing another feather in the engin-
eer's cap.
In conclusion, the individual should be an expert
in his field, know it thoroughly, but he should not,
by all means, fail to take a look around. Remember,
be critical of the words of others so that you may
benefit by their talents and their mistakes. Experi-
ence is what counts in this world, and the more you
can broaden yours, the better off you will be. All
in all, too many engineers are ill prepared to combat
the coming age of complete specialization. Be pre-
pared is the only way to meet specialization and
whip it, and this can only be done through an open
mind, alert and ready to learn from the ways of
mankind.

James Reeder joined Westinghouse in 1955—
now working on jet aircraft power systems
At 26, James R. Reeder, a 1955 BSEE graduate of
Vanderbilt University, is fast becoming an expert on
aircraft electrical systems. Now the project engineer in
charge of designing and developing control and protec-
tive equipment for the AC electrical system of North
American's A3J-1 twin jet fighter, he previously de-
signed transistorized protective equipment for the power
system in the Boeing 707 Stratocruiser.
Most important, Jim Reeder is doing exactly what he
wants to be doing. Upon completion of the Westinghouse
Student Training Course, he was assigned to the Aircraft
Equipment Department in Lima, Ohio. He has sub-
mitted 12 patent disclosures (which have resulted in
awards totaling more than $800.00); and he has four
U.S. patents pending. Active in the AIEE, he has com-
pleted more than half the work required for his MSEE
at the University of Pittsburgh through the Westinghouse
Graduate Study Program.
Jim Reeder is one of many talented young engineers
who are finding rewarding careers with Westinghouse.
You can, too, if you've got ambition and you're a man
of exceptional ability. Our broad product line and
decentralized operations provide a diversity of challeng-
ing opportunities for talented engineers. Guided missile
controls, atomic power, automation, radar, semicon-
ductors, and large power equipment are only a few of
the fascinating career fields to be found at Westinghouse.

research challenges of the petroleum industry. Shown
above are (1. to r.): Kemp Bunting, mechanical engi-
neer; Arthur Sisko, physical chemist; ThorntonTraise,
organic chemist; Wilbur Hayne, chemical engineer.
They are members of the research team that developed
Standard Oil's revolutionary new Supermil ASU
greases. These amazing lubricants are the first to
deliver normal performance at both extremely high
and low temperatures.
Four heads are better than one
Seldom is a major petroleum advance the work
of one man—or one kind of knowledge. It is the
result of a group of scientists whose skills
encompass many fields.
Take Standard Oil's amazing new Supermil
ASU greases, for example. These revolutionary
lubricants assure normal performance at fantas-
tic temperature extremes—from 70° F. below zero
to 480° above. Their development has made
possible major advances in America's Space Age
defense program and its industrial efficiency.
The story behind the development of Supermil
ASU greases is as fascinating as the products
themselves. For it is a story of Standard Oil
research teamwork. Physical chemists, organic
chemists, chemical engineers, mechanical engi-
neers and technicians worked together for five
years to break down a major barrier in the
lubricant field.
At Standard Oil, scientists and engineers of
many types have the opportunity to work on a
wide variety of challenging projects. That is one
reason why so many young men have chosen to
build satisfying careers with Standard Oil.

Alfred Marshall... on the tendencies of human action
"The laws of economics are lo be compared with the
laws of the tides, rather than with the simple and exact
law of gravitation. For the actions of men are so various
and uncertain, that the best statement of tendencies,
which we can make in a science of human conduct, must
needs be inexact and faulty. Th is might be urged as a
reason against making any statements at all on the sub-
ject; but that would be almost to abandon life. Life is
human conduct, and the thoughts and emotions that
grow up around it. By the fundamental impulses of our
nature we all — high and low, learned and unlearned —
are in our several degrees constantly striving lo under-
stand the courses of human action, and to shape them for
our purposes, whether selfish or unselfish, whether noble
or ignoble. And since we must form to ourselves some
notions of the tendencies of human action, our choice is
between forming those notions carelessly and forming
them carefully. The harder the task, the greater the need
for steady patient inquiry: for turning to account the
experience, that has been reaped by the more advanced
physical sciences; and for framing as best we can well
thought-out estimates, or provisional laws, of the ten-
dencies of human action.

INTO SPACE
With the ever-approaching reality of manned
space travel, a research tool capable of briefly
exploring space has been revealed—the X-15. by KENDALL BORN, '61E
First pilot to the moon? Not
quite. The "human factors" dummy
pictured here is being used in an
engineering test on the X-15. In-
formation from such dummys
make flights safer for human
pilots.
All photographs in this article cour-
tesy of North American Aviation.
High above Wendover Air Force
Base, Utah, two jet airplanes are
streaking at 40,000 feet; one is a huge
eight-jet bomber with a small rocket-
like plane snugged up under its wing,
and the other an F-100 chase plane. In
the cockpit of the rocket plane the pilot
is carrying out final preparations for the
beginning of a historic journey . . . .
"Fuel tanks on; automatic cameras roll-
ing; all gauges o.k. . . " Down the
check-out list he goes until all prepara-
tions are completed. Then the pilot
reaches over the switches on the all-im-
portant green drop light, notifying the
B-52 pilot that the rocket plane is ready
for flight. Over the intercom is heard
the dramatic count down: . . . "five—
four—three—two—one—Drop!''
Down, down drops the rocket plane,
falling from its mother ship like a huge
bomb. The pilot quickly pulls the throt-
tle into start position and the powerful
rocket engine blasts off, shooting the
plane forward with a sudden jerk. As
the plane accelerates, the pilot points the
nose straight up. Faster and faster—
hurtling toward outer space.
This is how the first United States
manned space flight will begin. The
vehicle? The newly developed rocket
plane—the North American X-15.
Although the X-15 seems revolution-
ary, actually, it is merely the latest of a
series of X-craft or "manned rocket
planes" which have slowly and painfully
evolved during the past decade. The first
of these rocket planes was developed in
1947 and was the first airplane to cross
the "sound barrier" in level flight—the
Bell X-l. This plane was soon followed
by a faster model, the X-l A, which was
capable of speeds two and one-half times
the speed of sound, or approximately
1,650 mph. Later another X-l model was
introduced—the X-lB. It was built pri-
marily for research on high speed fric-
tion heating. All the X-l planes were
air-launched from specially adapted
bomber-type airplanes. This was neces-
sary due to the short time in which the
planes could sustain full power—from
three to five minutes.
Soon there arose a need for the ex-
ploration of the thermal barrier encoun-
tered in high speed flight. The rocket
plane that was built for this purpose was
the Bell X-2. In 1956, Capt. Ivan Kinche-
loe of the United States Air Force flew
an X-2 to the present altitude record of
126,000 feet. Two weeks later another
Bell X-2 set the present speed record of
2,200 mph. Both the X-l and X-2 were
strictly research aircraft and both have

tion.

Man's dreams of space flight are rapidly becoming a reality with the X-15 leading
the way. The plane seen here is used in upper air research.
X-15 Most Advanced to Date
To carry on the work started by the
X-l and X-2 crafts, the X-15 has been
developed. This plane is not a completely
new design, but rather represents very
advanced concepts of proven design. Its
configuration is basically a body of revo-
lution, with triangular shaped blisters
running down each side of the fuselage
from just aft of the pilot's compartment
to the tail.
A look in the small, compact cockpit
reveals three control sticks. One is de-
signed for use when the pilot is under
the high load factor resulting from the
plane's acceleration upon blast-off or the
plane's deceleration upon re-entry into
the atmosphere. This stick can be opera-
ted by wrist action. A second stick will
be used in space flight when the pilot
encounters weightlessness. This stick,
also wrist operated, will control steam
jets located in the nose and wings. These
jets, powered by hydrogen peroxide
mono-propellant acting with a chemical
catalyst to create a steam, will keep the
ship on course in space flight where con-
ventional controls are ineffectual. Back
in the atmosphere the third control stick
will be used and will operate in the
conventional manner.
Directly aft of the cockpit is the in-
strumentation bay. In this area scientific
data-gathering equipment will record in-
formation on various research phases of
the flight. Also included in this section
is an inertial reference platform; a
unique navigating system that will con-
stantly inform the pilot of his position
in three dimensions.
Located adjacent to this area is the
auxiliary power unit which supplies
energy for both electronic and hydraulic
systems throughout the mission. This
unit is a small steam turbine, also oper-
ated on hydrogen peroxide and a catalyst.
From this compartment, aft, the fuselage
is filled primarily with liquid oxygen,
ammonia and helium pressure tanks.
Powerful Engine
The rocket engine, known as the
XLR-99, will burn liquid oxygen and
liquid ammonia and will develop 50,000
pounds thrust and more power (500,-
000 h.p.) at full speed than the carrier
Forrestal (260,000 h.p.). This engine
will not be available until late next year.
Meanwhile, two XLRll-5 rocket engines
of the type used throughout the X-1
program have the advantage of proven
engines for the early phases of the pro-
gram.
The propellants will be fed by a
pressure system causing flow in excess of
10,000 pounds per minute. This com-
pares with a rate of flow in a modern
jet fighter with afterburner (such as the
North American F-100) of from 500 to
666 pounds per minute, which means the
X-15 will gulp propellants about twenty
times as fast.
The blisters that extend down each
side of the fuselage house all the con-
trols, plumbing, and wiring from the
pilot's station to the powerplant section
and the control surfaces. Projecting from
these blisters are the small, thin wings,
which have blunt trailing edges and fair-
ly sharp leading edges. The horizontal
all-movable stabilizers also have blunt
trailing edges and have swept leading
edges. The vertical stabilizers are of
rather advanced design—wedge-shaped—
with an extremely blunt trailing edge
(12 inches across). This design was a
result of extensive wind-tunnel tests
The count-down over, the X-15 is re-
leased from the B-52 and begins its
solo flight into the ionosphere.

which revealed that the wedge-shape is
more efficient than conventional stream-
lined shapes for keeping the rocket plane
aligned on course at high altitudes when
the atmosphere thins out.
Inside the lower vertical stabilizer are
two retractable skids which are used in
conjunction with the nose wheel when
landing.
Liquid nitrogen, which will not sup-
port combustion, will be used as a cool-
ant for both pilot and equipment. The
pilot will carry a private oxygen atmos-
phere inside his specially-designed space
suit.
Initial Space Flight
The historic journey will begin at Ed-
wards Air Force Base, a testing center
for experimental aircraft in the desert
flats northeast of Los Angeles. Early be-
fore the sun rises, the X-15 will be
snugged up under the right wing of its
mother plane, a modified Boeing B-52.
Just before take-off time Capt. Robert A.
White of the United States Air Force
will be bolted into the small pilot com-
partment. The B-52 will then take off
and fly northeast toward Wendover Air
Force Base, Utah. En route the X-15's
tank of liquid oxygen will have to be
continually fed because of the fast evap-
oration of the LOX. In flight Capt.
White will be making all necessary checks
preparatory to "drop" time. At 40,000
feet above Wendover, the mother ship
will swing around toward Edwards and
pour on maximum power. At the "o.k."
signal from Capt. White the B-52 pilot
will release the X-15. Capt. White will
then fire the powerful rocket engine and
shoot off toward outer space. Rapidly
accelerating, the X-15 will cross the
"sound barrier," then the "heat barrier,"
and as the fuel diminishes, the velocity
will increase until the top speed of
approximately 3,600 mph. is achieved.
After a few minutes the powerful rocket
will sputted out, but at its terrific velocity
the X-15 will sail much farther. At the
top of the trajectory (over 100 miles up)
Capt. White will be in actual space
flight and will experience weightlessness.
Next comes the most ticklish leg of
the flight: re-entry into the atmosphere.
The problem here is the aerodynamic
heating which occurs as the atmosphere
becomes more dense and the load factor
builds up. At this point, the leading
edges of the X-15 are expected to ex-
ceed 1,0003F., which will cause them
to glow red. There are two re-entry pro-
files being considered. One would be to
plunge straight down into the thick air,
hoping to slow the craft as quickly as
possible. The other would be to strike
the atmosphere in a shallow descent and
decrease the speed gradually. If in this
gradual descent the plane began to over-
heat, the pilot could swing away from
the atmosphere until cooling took place.
Either method will require a reasonable,
experienced, courageous pilot.
After dropping back into the atmos-
phere, the pilot will glide down toward
a dry lake located near Edwards. Low
over the ground the ventral, or lower
tail fin, will be jettisoned and in its place
two stubby steel landing skids will pop
down. A conventional nose wheel will
unfold and the X-15 will swoop down
onto the lake at a terrific speed. The
entire trip, from drop to touchdown, will
consume about twenty minutes and will
be tracked over a precision radar range
running from Wendover to Edwards.

A miracle of highway engineering, this view of the Ford-Lodge Interchange in
Detroit typifies the trend of new high speed highways
through America's modern cities.
HIGHWAYS
OF
TOMORROW
by PETE HAMMERTON, '62E

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


longer a long-awaited promise but
are finally beginning to be built. After
many bitter fights and much lobbying,
the Congress passed Public Law 627 on
June 29, 1956, known as the Federal
Highway Act of 1956. This law calls
for increased aid to primary and secon-
dary roads and the building of a 41,000
mile system of freeways and super-high-
ways.
This new network of freeways is of
special interest to everyone: driver, land-
owner, engineer, and taxpayer. They will
link 90% of all American cities with a
population of 50,000 or more and bring
the new roads to many smaller commun-
ities. Though less than 1.2% of the
nation's 3.4 million miles of highways
will be covered, the system will handle
14% of the traffic load. The new high-
ways will also create many new jobs
while taking a bigger bite out of the
motorist's pocketbook.
Twenty-eight thousand miles of the
$24,825,000,000 net of freeways will
be of four-lane construction with a di-
viding median. Five to six thousand miles
will be two-lane roads with a center
strip, and seven thousand miles will
have two lanes with no center strip.
Most of these latter roads will be in the
little-traveled sections of the Middle
West. Built to expected 1975 demands,
all roads will have room to add more
lanes as needs dictate. In general, the
four-lane portions will resemble the best
Turnpikes in the country, such as the New
York Thruway. The right-of-way will be
Just as the sign says, this truck is test-
ing pavement in a constant effort to
improve highways for better wear and
travel.
150-300 feet wide depending on the lo-
cation and existing conditions. Each lane
will be twelve feet wide and the center
median will be greater than 36 feet wide
in rural areas and greater than four feet
wide in urban regions. The rural medians
will be landscaped with bushes and trees
to promote good drainage and cut the
glare of approaching headlights. The
shoulders will be of all-weather construc-
tion six to ten feet wide. Safety will be
promoted since there will be no traffic
lights, intersections, or railroad crossings
at grade, except in little-travelled areas.
All traffic will enter and leave the new
roads through interchanges at convenient
locations with speed change lanes to al-
low the motorist to adjust to the speed
of other traffic. In rural areas the min-
imum speed limit will vary between 50
and 70 miles per hour with a minimum
speed of 50 mph in urban areas. To
facilitate pleasant driving, no inclines
will be greater than 4% so the long line
of cars behind a truck laboring up a
steep grade will be eliminated.
Each state is responsible for planning
and building the new roads within its
borders while the federal government
sets up standards, supervises, and co-
ordinates the overall project. Actually,
building the new roads is a cinch com-
pared with the planning end of it. To be
useful, the freeways must be where the
people are. Unfortunately for the high-
way engineers, where there are people,
there are also houses, factories, schools,
businesses, and churches. And since no
two bodies can occupy the same place at
the same time, these aforementioned ob-
jects have to make way for the freeways.
Of course, even though an individual
is all in favor of progress, he sees little
reason and often is quite right in object-
ing to the new roads that would cut
through his front room. It is easy to see
that highway engineers and city planners
have to do some fancy talking to satisfy
everybody and still keep the new road
in the same county as they planned it.
Many new highways have been com-
pletely bogged down by public hearings,
petty politics, and charges and counter-
charges of this and that. A particularly
severe headache that officials have is the
actual purchase of the right-of-way.
When people discover the route of a
new highway, they buy up the land and
then charge the state many times its
worth to build a road on it. A few
states, such as California, are foresighted
enough to set up a special fund to pur-
chase proposed rights-of-way before the
routes are made public. With all these
problems encountered in building just
one road, try to imagine the planning
that has to go into 41,000 miles of road
using one million acres of land.
The Federal Highway Act has given
a gigantic boost to the construction busi-
ness, adding a total of 300,000 new
jobs. For each $1 billion increase in the
pre-1956 rate of $4.6 billion spent a
year, the industry will need these mate-
rials extra: cement—16 million barrels;
aggregates — 76,415,000 tons; steel —
510,000 tons; timber piling—2,823,000

To satisfy the demands of the public, auto-
makers are forced to play cloak and dagger
roles to keep future car designs a well - kept
secret. by SUE OTT, '61E
Door locks that can be changed in a
matter of seconds and a high-pow-
ered telescope trained an surrounding
buildings: this is Ford's styling center se-
curity force on the job. Not only can
every lock in the building be changed
within an hour, but the locks themselves
are put together inside the building to
prevent unauthorized persons from gain-
ing access.
Auto makers must have the element of
surprise if they are to remain in busi-
ness. There are two reasons for this.
First, the auto maker wants to produce
something new that the public will like
without having the other manufacturers
come out with the same thing at the
same time. Otherwise he would have to
share the market, so to speak. Secondly,
he feels that the public likes a grand
unveiling each year of his newest crea-
tion. He lives in constant fear that the
car-buying public will know all about
it before it ever reaches the showroom.
This is why the veil of secrecy closely
shrouds Detroit's styling activities.
Other devices employed at Fords in-
clude the badge system. Each studio has
a different color for its badges—for in-
stance, people who work in the Ford
studio wear red badges with their pic-
tures on them and Edsel personnel wear
brown ones. Persons wearing one color
are not permitted to enter other studios.
This is based on the premise that if em-
ployees want to talk about what they've
seen, they will talk—the only thing that
can be done is to limit what they see.
Executives have badges that permit them
to go anywhere in the styling center.
Visitors to the center are not allowed
out of the lobby unescorted. They are
screened by a receptionist while a guard
watches nearby. The badge system is
backed up by weekly posters entreating
employees to "Think Before You Speak"
in an effort to prevent leakage of infor-
mation by word-of-mouth. The security
force does all badge-making within the
building. The contents of locked waste-
baskets in which restricted material is
disposed of are burned under security
force supervision—the same precautions
are taken when old models are destroyed.
Topped off with the 60-power telescope,
this system is so effective that on three
occasions, vice-presidents of the company
were stopped at the door because they
were not wearing their badges.
As long as things are kept within the
styling department, secrets are generally
safe. But when the dies for the new
model are to be made, outsiders must
be brought in on it. The way the auto
makers try to get around this is to parcel
out the work. That is, a Cleveland tool
and die maker will make the front
fender dies, while one in Flint produces
the rear deck lid dies. Newspapermen
often track down the various parts; an
experienced eye can reconstruct the whole
car quite accurately with little informa-
tion.
Security System Relatively New
Not too many years ago, styling was
of practically no importance, and such
shenanigans as locked wastebaskets would
have been laughed at. Some auto makers
even let the people who made their dies
design the car. There was no need to
pour millions of dollars into styling, when
the main selling points were performance
and dependability. If a car got you
where you wanted to go and home again
without coming apart, it was a good car.
Shortly after the end of World War
II, Studebaker came out with a radically
new design which was an immediate suc-
cess. Other companies began to follow
suit. In 1949, the Ford had been
changed from a lumpy, unlovely sil-
houette to a comparatively sleek, inte-
grated whole. The trend had been set.
Really, it had been set by the public.
Car stylists do style for the car buyers.
And, perhaps not so obvious is the fact
that they style more to please the woman
than the man. Years ago, the purchase
of a car was a man's prerogative; the
rest of the family had no say-so in the
matter. Then women began to indirectly
influence car sales. They wanted colors
and so cars became colorful. They wanted
attractiveness and comfort, and today
these are major selling points. Nowadays,
one takes for granted that the car will
run and run well. The deciding point
is the style of the car.
Therefore, stylists do not style cars
to win design awards (although some
do)—they try to produce what the public
has indicated it likes. The only sure way
to tell what the public prefers is by sales.
There are agencies such as Ward's Auto-
motive Report and R. L. Polk who gather
such data and sell it to the auto com-
panies. From it, they can tell what
colors are selling best industry-wide,
whether the public likes lots of chrome.

studio at Ford's—La Galaxie envisions
the use of such operating features as
an electronic device which would warn
of oncoming cars. One can hardly tell

carefully has it been sanded, painted,
and ornamented.

or if they like "fins" (known in the in-
dustry as "blades"). If the more deluxe
models of a "series" such as the LeSabre,
Invicta and Electra, are selling better than
the standard model, the indication is that
chrome is popular. Stylists hate chrome,
but the public likes it, so many models
are styled with lots of nice, shiny chrome.
Sometimes, designs which are esthetically
wrong to the artist are ones which sell
the best. But as one public relations man
says, "Auto makers are not philanthropic;
we don't aim to educate the public in
art appreciation."
When one enters a styling studio
(which this writer was not al-
lowed to do, since few are), he sees
teams of artists working together. One
man does not do it all alone. Most
often, groups of stylists work on one
specific part, i.e., roofs, grills, or rear
fenders, making hundreds of sketches of
these parts, which are called idea
sketches. Working closely with the styl-
ists are engineers, who keep the stylists
in the realm of the practical. There is
one exception to this, and that is the
advanced styling studio. Here, the de-
signs needn't be practical at all; the sky's
the limit.

A stylist has some general problems
involved in his job. First, the car should
have recognizable individuality, and
second, it should have an "institutional"
look, that is, the look of the company
that manufactures it. At Fords, the
Edsel, Mercury, Lincoln and Ford studios
are kept separate to discourage the ten-
dency for each car to resemble another.
Styling Process
The process a new model undergoes
from inception goes something like this:
About 30 months before introduction
date, the artists start work on the idea
sketches. While this is going on, the
"package" is being developed by the en-
gineers. A package is the skeleton of

One of the stalwart females still
in the College of Engineering is
Susan Ott, the author of this
month's article on Auto Styling.
Naval Architecture is Sue's field of
specialization and she is expecting
her degree in 1961.
Sue came to Ann Arbor two years
ago as a graduate of Detroit Luth-
eran High School. While in high
school, she was in dramatics and
the choir and wrote for the school's
yearbook and newspaper.
the automobile; it includes such things
as inside and outside dimensions, speci-
fications for head room and leg room,
locations of door handles, window lifts
and arm rests, new developments in en-
gines and transmissions, and includes the
factors of comfort, visibility, and a low
center of gravity. It is up to the stylists
to conform to the package, to put flesh
on the skeleton.
When desirable style trends are estab-
lished, the best of these are made into
full-scale drawings, to give a better idea
of the styles. Since a decision can't be
made just on the basis of a two-dimen-
sional drawing, three-dimensional clay
models are constructed which are 3/8
full size. Every step of the way, engi-
neers, cost estimators, and manufacturing
experts make certain that the styles will
offer no insolvable problems. Then com-
pany officials make the final decision re-
garding "sheet metal," that is, the body
contours. The choices regarding orna-
mentation and interior styling are not
made until later. This is about 20
months before introduction.
Then modelers make up a full-scale
clay model, which is revised time and
again. When the exact contours are
approved by company executives, a plas-
ter cast is made of it, because the shrink-
age of clay involves dimensional inac-
curacies. The clay model is painted and
ornamented so that one can hardly tell
it from the real thing. Concurrently, a
full sized "seating buck" is made up to
prove beyond doubt that the dimensions
of the package have been maintained.
MARCH, 1959
19




Then the interior stylists go to work on
the buck. Having studied fashion and
interior home decoration, they try to
choose fabrics for seats and floors
that are currently in style—as well as
up-to-date color combinations. Since a
woman has come to think of her car as
an extension of her living room, and
since it is believed that a woman may
be behind as much as 80% of car sales,
this part of automotive styling is aimed
most especially at her.
Meanwhile, the plaster casts have been
sent out to various shops for tooling,
and the fabricators are making up the
six or eight handmade cars to be used
on the proving grounds and in the "tor-
ture chambers." These cars can cost as
much as $100,000 to build, but they
are never sold. They are, instead, even-
tually broken up.
With this, the stylists have completed
their job on that year's model. In the
studios are 3 or 4 cars to follow. At
the present time, car manufacturers have
started the 1962 model, have just ap-
proved the sheet metal on the 1961, and
are road testing the I960.
Artists work on carefully constructed
clay model whose dimensions must be
constantly checked for accuracy against
the original specifications of the "pack-
age" by means of an aluminum bridge
over the model. From this full-sized
model will be made the plaster casts
used to prepare the dies, if this par-
ticular design is chosen.
Thirty-Month Cycle
Stylists would like to have 36 months
to complete a car—more often they have
only 30 months. This writer was told
that this could possibly be cut to 20
months, but that this would constitute a
"panic" program, something to be
avoided at all costs. Auto styling can't
be automated—no one has yet invented
a machine that will produce original
ideas. Thus, the whole industry is gov-
erned by the 30-month cycle.
One may ask how companies can pre-
dict what the public will like three years
hence. They can't exactly, but it is ex-
tremely unlikely that general tastes would
make a complete reversal in that time.
Furthermore, each car is a natural out-
growth of its predecessor, so that a pat-
tern or trend is followed.
The Big Three auto companies can't
be too quick to jump into something
unproven in the auto field, for instance,
small cars. It costs hundreds of millions
of dollars to design and tool a new
model. This is why automotive styling
is often called the world's biggest gam-
ble. Smaller companies like American
Motors and Studebaker can afford to be
more daring than their giant brothers.
They are presently taking advantage of
the "small car market," by manufacturing
"compact" cars. However, figures of
small car sales of a couple of years ago
(53,000) brought this comment from
one Big Three official: "Fifty-three
thousand? Why, shucks, we mislay that
many cars in transit." Sales for 1958
may reach 400,000—still a mere drop in
the bucket.
If the Big Three become convinced
that the "small car market" will continue-
to increase, and remain permanent, they
may go into production. However, the
feeling in Detroit is that they and small
cars can coexist peacefully.

special Operating Engineers Training Program at
Bell Laboratories. This 19-month course of study
—with full pay —deals with advanced techniques
and new concepts in electronics which signal a
new era in telephony. It involves both classroom
theory and practical laboratory applications.
When Jim and his colleagues return to their
companies, they'll review major engineering proj-
ects. This will assure the best use of equipment
for current engineering, as well as for expected
new developments in communications.
"I wanted a job I could grow with," says Jim,

In only five years, ingenious engineering tech-
niques have produced a new piece of equip-
ment second only to color in importance in the
television world. by JAY SKLAR, '60E
Probably the most valuable of all
entities existing in the modern world
is time. For time, once lost, cannot be
regained. More and more, man is trying
to make better use of his time and to
develop means for conserving it. Today,
cash value is placed on time; in the fac-
tories of an industrial world, workers
are paid by the hour, and as these hours
are more efficiently used, production on
an hourly basis increases. In the world
of radio and television, time is purchased
much like a page is bought for advertis-
tising purposes in a newspaper. Thous-
ands of dollars are often paid for a sin-
gle minute; therefore, the television or
radio producer desires to make the best
possible use of the time allotted to his
program.
One of the biggest difficulties these
producers encounter is presenting a show
throughout the country at the same hour.
If a television advertiser purchases a very
desirable viewing time, say eight o'clock
in the evening, for a national telecast, he
will want the entire nation to see his
program at eight o'clock. However, if
transmission is simultaneous across the
country, and a telecast is made at eight
in New York City, the Los Angeles
audience will see the program at five
o'clock in the afternoon. No advertiser
will pay eight o'clock rates for a five
o'clock audience! Even if the rates are
adjusted to account for this difficulty,
the Los Angeles audience will still want
to see the eight o'clock show at a more
convenient time for them. Television and
radio producers desire some means of
delaying program material to allow tele-
casts to be viewed at the same hour
everywhere in the United States.
Another problem for the producer is
one of errors. Live broadcasts are often
filled with mistakes because of insuffi-
cient rehearsal; many hours are required
for these sessions. If there were some
way in which short scenes could be prac-
ticed individually, recorded, and then
pieced together, this headache could be
eliminated. Costs of actors' time would
be reduced and higher quality programs
would result.
Preservation of Program Material
Very often a great deal of money is
spent for a "spectacular" or some other
extravaganza. For many weeks, the actors,
producers, and cameramen will rehearse
over and over again some program that
will last an hour or so on the air. Then,
all will be lost and no one in the future
will reap the benefits of this work. Some
method to preserve these precious mo-
ments of superb program materials is
therefore desired.
The advertiser is also interested in the
preservation angle. Since he must pay
huge sums of money for his brief an-
nouncement, he would like the option to
approve the advertisement before using
it. If it was unsatisfactory, changes could
be made. It is obvious at this point that
the need for permanent recordings of
radio and television broadcasts is strong
enough to prompt large investments for
its satisfaction.
The radio industry did not have to
look far to find one. Even older than
the radio was the phonograph, and at
first this was the usual means to a per-
manent record of radio broadcasts. Sim-
ilarly, the television industry turned to
the motion picture. However, these meth-
ods were not ideal. Disc recordings be-
came scratched after several replays and
they could not be easily edited. In ad-
dition, each disc could be used only
once. Motion picture film was expen-
sive, could not be reused, and required
lengthy processing. Although these meth-
ods were used for a considerable number
of years, money was being spent, mean-
while, to find better methods.
Audio Tape Ideal for Radio
The radio industry's problem was re-
lieved first. After a long period in de-
velopment, the magnetic tape recorder
was introduced. No processing was re-
quired, editing was easily accomplished
with scissors and "Scotch" tape, and each
piece of tape could be re-recorded an
indefinite number of times. Immediately,
radio stations adopted this technique and
magnetic-tape-recorded broadcasts com-
pletely replaced disc programs.
Soon after the perfection of audio
magnetic tape, the idea of using mag-
netic tape for television recordings arose.
Certainly, this was not unnatural; how-
ever, the increased complexity of televi-
sion broadcasting made it impossible to
utilize standard audio recording meth-
ods.
The audio magnetic tape consists of a
plastic strip coated with a magnetic ma-
terial. At a speed of three to fifteen
inches of tape per second, this ribbon is
fed through the narrow gap of a horse-

shoe electromagnet. As the audio signal
is sent through the coils of this magnet,
a proportional field is set up around it.
This field affects the magnetic material,
leaving the various portions of it in
various stages of magnetization. There-
fore, the tape leaves the recording head,
as the electromagnet is called, with in-
formation concerning the audio signal
stored in a magnetic field, the strength of
which varies along the tape in a way that
is related to the audio signal.
Why not apply magnetic tape to
record television material? There is one
reason which renders this impossible.
Magnetic tape recorded at the usual
speeds did not have the frequency re-
sponse characteristic required to record
the information necessary to reproduce
a television or video signal. Just why this
is so depends on the frequency-wave-
length principle.
Problem of Tape Speed
From the study of physics, the reader
is probably aware that frequency and
wavelength are inversely proportional.
High frequencies, therefore, have short
wavelengths. To record a video signal,
the tape must be capable of storing, with
a fair degree of accuracy, an extremely
short wavelength.
One way to do this involved speeding
up the tape. Suppose we want to record
a frequency of one megacycle. (Frequen-
cies up to five megacycles are common
in video signal.) This means that there
will be one million complete cycles
attempting to get onto this piece of tape
each second. If the tape is only moving
at fifteen inches per second, the usual
audio speed, this means we are trying
to fit one million cycles on fifteen in-
ches of magnetic tape. They simply will
not all fit. Therefore, let us speed up the
tape. RCA's first experimental model in-
corporated a tape speed of 240 inches
per second. Evidently, this was suffi-
cient, because hopes ran high that video
tape would soon be commercially avail-
able. There were two big problems. At
this speed of about twenty-five miles per
hour, a seventeen inch reel would only
record a four minute program and any
variation in the speed would cause ex-
treme distortion of the picture. Some-
how, slower tape speeds had to become
an essential feature of the video tape
system.
Bing Crosby, Inc., an equipment man-
ufacturer in California, attempted to get
the same information on the tape by
utilizing multiple tracks. Also, experi-
ments with sampling of the video signal
were tried. However, none of these sys-
tems were very effective. Tape speed still
remained high and picture quality con-
tinued to be poor.
Ampex Engineers Successful
While attention in the video world
was focused on RCA and Crosby, Inc.,
and while these groups were developing
high and constant speed motors for use
with their high speed tapes, the Ampex
Corporation was quietly working on a
completely different system based on a
new principle. Suddenly, they made an
announcement of their system's capa-
bilities and of their intention to have
commercial models available soon. The
surprise was almost dramatic.
The Ampex engineers were well exper-
ienced in magnetic tape recording. Al-
ready well-known as the leader in audio
tape technique, they had previously solved
most of the problems of audio recording.
Now they turned their efforts to video
tape.
Certain that high speed tape was
essential to successful video recording,
the engineers at Ampex set out to apply
the basic laws of dynamics concerned
with relative motion. Although they con-
ceded it was impractical to run the tape
at a high constant speed, they did not
admit they were defeated in maintaining

AND
RESEARCH
The Technic is happy to announce a new look in "Michigan—

several recent on-campus developments.
However, the Technic will still continue to report interesting
and outstanding local research projects in greater length
in the regular articles section.

Luminescent Chamber
Two University of Michigan assistant
physics professors have found a new
method of photographing the tracks of
nuclear particles which should prove to
be a valuable contribution to the study
of atomic physics. The device, called a
"luminescent chamber," has been devel-
oped through the efforts of Martin L.
Pearl and Lawrence W. Jones, assistant
professors of physics, during the past
nine months. Their project was co-spon-
sored by the Office of Naval Research,
Project Michigan, and the Michigan
Phoenix Atomic Energy Program.
The luminescent chamber makes it
possible to photograph the tracks of
nuclear particles such as electrons, pro-
tons, and mesons. The operation of the
device relies upon the fact that when
atomic particles collide with certain sub-
stances, called scintillating crystals, flashes
of light of very small magnitude are
produced. The scintillating crystal con-
cept is used to advantage in such elec-
trical devices as television picture tubes
and fluorescent lights. These devices pro-
duce light when millions of particles col-
lide with scintillating crystals. The scien-
tists, however, wanted to record the light
from a single collision, a flash so weak
that its intensity would have to be
strengthened over 100,000 times to re-
cord on the most sensitive photographic
film. Strengthening of the flashes was
achieved through the use of newly de-
veloped "image" tubes which gather the
light, intensify it, and pass it along to
similar tubes for further intensification.
The new tubes were developed through
the efforts of the Westinghouse Electric
Company and the Radio Corporation of
America.
Further refining of the luminescent
chamber made it possible for the device
to record a single scintillation without
recording the scintillations of other par-
ticles. Thus, for example, scientists can
record the path of a single electron while
excluding the reactions of protons, me-
sons, or other electrons.
Together with the newly developed
bubble chamber, also perfected at the
University of Michigan, the luminescent
chamber will give scientists a new oppor-
tunity to explore the properties of atomic
particles and reactions,
Faculty Appointments
At their meeting of January 16, 1958
the University of Michigan Board of
Regents approved the appointments of
three new professors to the College of
Engineering. The promoted men are
Newbern Smith, Kuei Chuang, and An-
drejs Olte.
Dr. Smith, who has been a member of
the Willow Run Laboratories staff since
1954, will assume his new duties as
professor of electrical engineering at the
beginning of the 1959-60 academic year.
His education includes three degrees
from the University of Pennsylvania, a
Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engi-
neering, a Master of Science in Electrical
Engineering, and a Doctor of Philosophy
in Physics. Since joining the University
of Michigan in 1954 his activities have
included the direction of the Willow Run
Radar Laboratory and a consulting posi-
tion with Project Michigan.
Dr. Chuang assumed the position of
assistant professor of electrical engineer-
ing at the beginning of the second
semester of the 1958-59 year and will
continue through the 1959-60 year. He

has earned two degrees from the Uni-
versity of Michigan, a Master's and a
Doctor of Philosophy. Feedback control,
an important part of the electronics field,
is Dr. Chuang's specialty.
Olte has been apointed as half-time
assistant professor of electrical engineer-
ing for the period of February 1, 1959
to June 30, I960. His education includes
an Associate in Arts degree from River-
side (California) College and Bachelor
of Science and Master of Science degrees
from the University of California. From
1954 to 1958 he worked on research
projects at the University of California.
"Analog Engine"
Simulation of a free-piston engine
through use of analog computers has
been demonstrated by two University of
Michigan scientists. Vernon L. Larrowe,
research engineer, and Margaret M.
Spencer, associate research engineer have
developed the simulation which will al-
low engineers to determine the char-
acteristics of a free-piston engine without
actually building one. Free-piston en-
gines, comparatively new and untried in
the automobile industry, must be de-
signed to get the highest possible effi-
ciency in actual use.
The computers allow engineers to slow
down the events of a cycle so that an
operation which would take one-hun-

dredth of a second in a real engine takes
ten seconds in the simulated engine. By
feeding all possible mechanical possibili-
ties into the computers engineers can
determine the most efficient way to build
the engine. By using the computers the
necessity of building many test engines
of different designs is eliminated.
A second advantage of the simulated
engine lies in the fact that when pressure,
temperature, or mechanical limits are ex-
ceeded in the similated engine a warn-
ing signal is produced by the computer
while an actual test engine would break
down and possibly cause serious dam-
age. Scientists feed known engine equa-
tions into the computers in such a way
that the engine simulation is the result.
About 144 hours are necessary to set up
the computers for the simulation.
Proposed Moon Lab
A device to determine the structure of
the moon's surface by means of reflected
radar waves from a laboratory orbiting
around the moon has been proposed by
three University of Michigan faculty
members. The three, Keeve M. Siegel,

professor of electrical engineering, Wil-
liam E. Fensler, research engineer, and
Thomas B. A. Senior, associate research
mathematician, say that the laboratory
can be built from materials already in
production.
The laboratory would be 150 feet long,
six feet in diameter, and weigh less than
4,000 pounds. After its trip through
space the laboratory would orbit about
100 miles above the surface of the moon.
It would bounce radar waves of ten diff-
erent frequencies off the moon's surface
to determine the consistency of its outer
layer. The device would transmit its
data back to earth to be analyzed by
scientists. The final results would con-
firm or deny growing scientific evidence
that the moon's outer layer is composed
of sand or dust-like materials. The data
would also provide valuable information
about the contour and secondary layers
of the moon. The advantage of having
the laboratory circling the moon lies in
the fact that certain radar waves are in-
terfered with considerably by the earth's
atmosphere.
The rocket which would launch the
laboratory would weigh about 500,000
pounds at take-off with the first stage
rocket engine producing about 750,000
pounds of thrust. When the laboratory
neared the moon additional rockets would
come into play to reduce the speed and
allow it to go into orbit.
Operation of the translucent chamber
depends upon image amplifying devices
contained in plastic boxes (background).

The Willgoos Turbine Engine Test Facility is the world's most
extensive privately owned turbine development laboratory. De-
signed and built specifically to test full-scale experimental en-
gines and components in environments simulating conditions at
extreme altitudes and speeds, it is currently undergoing expan-
sions that will greatly increase its capacity for development test-
ing of the most advanced forms of air breathing systems.

In the new Fuel Systems Laboratory engineers
can minutely analyze the effects of extreme en-
vironmental conditions on components of fuel
systems — conditions such as those encoun-
tered in advanced types of flight vehicles
operating at high Mach numbers and high alti-
tudes. Fuel for these tests can be supplied at
any temperature from —65°F to +500°F.

Unmatched Engineering Facilities for Developing
Advanced Flight Propulsion Systems
Operations at Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft are essen-
tially those of an engineering and development
organization. As such, an engineering atmosphere
dominates the work being done, much of which di-
rectly involves laboratory experimentation.
In the past three decades, expansion at Pratt &amp;
Whitney Aircraft has been almost tenfold. In
recent years, greatest emphasis has been on extend-
ing engineering facilities to meet the needs of ad-
vanced research and development programs in flight
propulsion.
Among the Connecticut P &amp; W A facilities are
many that are unequaled in the industry. Thus
today, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft is better prepared
than ever to continue development of the world's
best aircraft powerplants ... to probe the propulsion
future ... to build and test greatly advanced pro-
pulsion systems for coming generations of flight vehi-
cles — in whatever form they take.

ENGINEERING MECHANICS
by FRANCIS FAY, '60E
ngineers were once described by a
Fi man now in industry as those men
who knew that: "F = m times a and
that you can't push on a rope!" As
humorous as this description is, however,
it is true that forces do play an important
part in every engineer's life. Not only
are there mechanical forces, but also
electrical forces. Then too, the effects
of forces on structures and in fluids are
studied by some engineers. Thus, forces
have been interwoven into every branch
of the engineering profession, and me-
chanics, the field of science which deals
specifically with forces, can be seen to
be basic to all of them.
Mechanics has always been an essen-
tial part of engineering curricula at the
University of Michigan. Prior to 1911,
the basic courses in mechanics at the
University were taught by two depart-
ments. Courses in dynamics were offered
by the Department of Physics and Mathe-
matics, while the Department of
Civil Engineering offered instruction in
strength of materials. This arrangement,
however, proved to be unsatisfactory.
At the turn of the century, engineering
fields other than civil became interested
in advanced studies in mechanics. Fur-
thermore, these new interests were in
areas such as dynamic loading, resilience,
and stress concentrations, which were of
little importance to the departments of
Civil Engineering, and Physics and
Mathematics. Therefore a change was
imminent, for this educational system had
to be revamped to serve the new interest
in mechanics.
In 1911, the Department of Engineer-
ing Mechanics was established at the
University. The department was to offer
the elementary or basic courses in me-
chanics, which were common to all en-
ginering curriculums. The objectives of
this change were threefold. First, the
elementary courses were to be of such
a nature that any type of subsequent or
advanced work could conveniently be
pursued. Secondly, these courses could
also serve as complete instruction for
those curriculums which only require a
general background in mechanics. Finally,
the new program would permit instruc-
tors in the Departments of Civil Engi-
neering, and Physics and Mathematics
to devote more time to advanced studies
in their particular fields. Beyond these
objectives, moreover, there was a pro-
vision for advanced courses. Any de-
partment could request special mechanics
courses to be offered by the Department
of Engineering Mechanics.
Since 1911, the Department of Engi-
neering Mechanics has grown steadily.
Today the department not only has a
comprehensive group of courses in engi-
neering mechanics, but also has both
undergraduate and graduate degree pro-
grams.
Three Areas of Department
The scope of engineering mechanics
is very broad. To gain an idea of what
engineering mechanics is, it is convenient
to arbitrarily divide the field into three
areas—statics and dynamics, strength of
materials, and fluid mechanics. Beyond
these definitions a better understanding
can be gained through illustrations of
industrial applications.

Engineering mechanics comes
easy to Francis Fay, the author of
this article, as he is presently en-
rolled in that department of the
College. In addition, he worked for
about eight months on the Red-
stone missile as an aide in the
dynamics testing section of Crys-
ler.
Now a junior, Francis comes
from Rochester, N. Y., where he-
was quite active in high school
sports. He is a member of the

EXPOSURE PROTECTION

TOO LATE ^
to prevent serious heat exposure, a valiant attempt it made
by firefighters to prevent rupture of tankage, not already
involved in flames, with relatively ineffective hose streams.
GRINNELL WATER SPRAY SYSTEM
shown under test at the Marietta, Ohio plant of the Bakelite
Union Carbide Plastic Company, a division of the Union Carbide
Corporation. Water - when it is applied in time and distributed
over the surfaces efficiently by a properly engineered system-is
most effective in limiting tank fires and controlling their spread.
Proper safeguards are uppermost in importance in
protecting tanks which contain gases and flammable
liquids in the event of fire. For example, tanks must
be guarded against extreme heat exposure. Leaking
gas, if it should develop, must be diluted to the point
where it will not burn. And fire, if it should occur,
must be localized and controlled or extinguished.
With a Grinnell Water Spray System, you get
protection against all these eventualities.
Before heat raises tank temperatures dangerously,
an enveloping spray of water provides instant cool-
ing, reducing internal pressure which helps prevent
rupture. In addition, air turbulence is created (even
in still air) which, in conjunction with the water
vapor from the spray, helps dilute the flammable
vapors controlling or extinguishing the fire. Flam-
mable products which cannot be safely extinguished
can be burned off under the protecting water spray
with no damage to adjacent protected equipment.
There is a Grinnell Fire Protection System for
every fire hazard. Call on Grinnell for advice about

STRAIGHT TALK TO ENGINEERS
from Donald W. Douglas, Jr.
President, Douglas Aircraft Company
In this fast-moving age we find that we can no
longer insure leadership... or even survival...
by doing things the traditional way. If there's a
better way, we must find it.
Our DC-8, C-133, Thor, Nike-Hercules, Genie,
Sparrow and other aircraft and missiles are all
the finest of their type and time. But their
success, and that of our many new projects,
depends on superior engineering.
That's why I'm looking for engineers dedicated
to quality work. Only through such dedication
can the extra performance and reliability of our
products be attained. If you feel as we do about
this principle, we'd certainly like to hear from
you in regard to a future at Douglas.

PROGRESS
Edited by MERV ROBERTS, '62E
During the past few months there
have been many important developments
in industry. General Electric has devel-
oped a quartz thread with startling new
properties. Women will receive more
help from the University of Michigan
scientists who are doing research on
dishwashing. A new type of mechanical
counter utilizes a planetary gear drive
and a new metal finishing process has
been developed to give metals a frosted
appearance. For the details—
"Frosted" Metals Now Available
A new-—real cool—finish called "Fro-
Zon" is now being applied to stainless
steel, giving the shiny metal a frosty
appearance.
Developed by Stamping Service, Inc.,
of Detroit, Mich., the new finish is being
used on automobile trim sections of stain-
less steel supplied by Allegheny Ludlum
Steel Corporation.
The new finish is made possible by a
type of "semi-blasting" technique which
gives the metal a frosted look by forming
tiny mounds on the surface of the metal.
This process, which is put on very lightly
and does not penetrate the surface of the
metal, diffuses light rays and gives the
frosted appearance.
All kinds of patterns, lettering, bossed,
deposed, flat or contoured surface, can
be handled by the new process. Also, the
finish is applied after the stainless steel
part is formed.
At the present time the company has
done work only in the automotive in-
dustry, but expects to take this process
to other fields shortly. The developers
are aiming at the home appliance, archi-
tectural, furniture, toy and related fields.
Cooking utensil manufacturers are ex-
pected to be interested in the new finish,
too.
Stamping Service, Inc. engineers will
not disclose the method of applying the
unique finish. They report that they can
put it on any size, type or gauge of a
shiny surface of stainless steel. They
have done most of their work on Type
430 stainless steel. This is the type used
in the automobile industry for window
trim, side and body mouldings and
numerous other trim and functional parts
of today's automobile.
Neither heat nor cold has any effect
on the surface treatment, and under ac-
celerated field tests weathering doesn't
seem to have any effect either.
Mechanical Counter Utilizes
New Concept
A new concept in mechanical counters
called "PlanetGear" has been developed
by the Haydon Instrument Company,
using a planetary gear drive to rotate the
numerals, instead of the usual Geneva
movement.
The quick transfer of numbers is ac-
complished by means of a nylon cam and
roller compensating device, which moves
the planetary gear. There is no possi-
bility of skips or misses since the gears
are always in mesh.
An outstanding feature of the Haydon
counter is the uniform low torque re-
quired to turn the drums. Any device
capable of turning the first numeral drum
is capable of driving the entire counter
reliably, as there are no peak load points
in the operation of the counter, such as
when turning from 999,999 to 000,000.
The smooth rolling action of the plan-
etary gears makes it possible to drive the
counting wheels at continuous speeds of
1000 R.P.M. (or 10,000 counts per
minute). Life tests have been run in
excess of 100,000,000 counts.
The bearings, gears, cams and rollers
are nylon. The main shaft is centerless
ground, polished stainless steel. The
large 5/16" numbers for easy reading
conform to military specifications.
U-M Scientists Do Research on
Age-Old Problem—Dishwashing
Woman's oldest drudgery and man's
newest atomic research techniques will
be combined in a three-year project just
starting at The University of Michigan
School of Public Health.
The scientists will smear mountains
of dishes with radioactive bacteria and
kitchen greases, then put them through
ordinary cleaning and washing processes.
Their goal is to learn the health
hazard of the invisible "grease film" that
sticks to household dishes and utensils
despite repeated washing.
Housewives know the film as an
annoying blur that clings to glassware
and dishes and makes them feel slip-
pery after even the most thorough clean-

or "chemicals in the water," but the U-M
researchers say it is neither.
According to Edward H. Armbruster,
principal investigator on the project, the
film "consists of various vegetable and
animal greases, thin as a fingerprint."
Ordinary household cleaning merely
spreads the film over the surface. It is
almost impossible to remove.
One simple test for grease film is to
wet the article with clear water. If the
water forms into droplets that cling to
the sides, a grease film is present. If the
glass or dish is perfectly clean, the water
will sheet off evenly.
While the film itself is harmless,
Armbruster says the danger lies in its
ability to trap and shield bacteria through
repeated washings.
He and Prof. Gerald M. Ridenour of
the U-M Department of Environmental
Health will explore this protective func-
tion of the grease film, and will seek new
ways to remove it from typical home and
restaurant equipment. Their study will
include dishes and utensils made of
china, plastic, steel, glass and aluminum.
Three additional research specialists will
be employed on the project.
In the first stage of their work, they
will soil various kitchen articles with
radioactive tallow, cooking oils and ani-
mal fats. At each stage of the washing
and cleaning process, the researchers will
measure the radiation to learn the amount
of grease film remaining.
Later, they will contaminate hundreds
of dishes and glasses with radioactive
germs (Staphylococcus aureus), and
again put them through routine wash-
ings. A similar radiation count will then
determine how many germs are present
on seemingly "clean" dishes.
The project is being supported by a
$60,000 grant from the U. S. Public
Health Service.
"The information obtained from our
study," Armbruster said, "will be ap-
plicable to homes, restaurants, bars and
food processing plants."
But of the U-M scientists succeed,
they will bring on the emancipation of
millions of husbands throughout the na-
tion.
"Because," Armbruster remarked "once
we get rid of the grease film, no one
will have to dry dishes anymore. The
water will sheet off rapidly and evenly,
and the dishes will literally dry them-
selves."
General Electric Announces
Quartz Thread
General Electric recently announced
development of a quartz thread, one of
the most heat-resistant materials on earth
for its weight.
Gossamer-thin, continuous monofila-
ments of fiber, made from pure quartz,
have been successfully twisted into thread
and woven into cloth on textile equip-
ment, according to the G.E. Lamp Glass
Department in Cleveland, Ohio.
Quartz thread, in the form of cloth,
may be used to reinforce plastics now
widely used in aircraft and missiles, and
would greatly improve strength-to-weight
ratios and increase the potential pay-load
of space vehicles.
A wide range of possible commercial
and industrial applications are foreseen
for the new quartz thread and cloth,
including such uses as filters, thin insula-
tion in flexible or irregular form, safety
devices and heat-resistant plastic struc-
tural forms for industry, machinery and
building. However, the properties of
quartz that make it of great value as a
product, cause difficulties in manufacture
that result in a price many times that of
ordinary fiber.
Key to the G-E discovery is the un-
paralleled ability of quartz thread and
cloth to withstand elevated temperatures
and still retain tensile strength far in
excess of any other textiles. Due to the
chemical inertness of quartz it has ex-
cellent resistance to weathering. The
same property limits the possibility of
dyeing or staining quartz cloth. Fused
quartz is exposed in industrial use to
continuous temperatures over 1800°F,
and for short periods of time over
3000°F.
Plastics are presently reinforced with
many materials introduced in the form
of thread, mesh or cloth. Cloth made of
the new G-E quartz thread will provide
greater reinforcement to plastics, making
them much stronger at the extreme tem-
peratures they meet in rocket and missile
applications. And where the plastics re-
inforced with quartz replace metal, there
is a potential weight reduction of more
than 10-to-one.
As a rule of thumb, designers allow
at least 500 pounds of gross missile
weight for each pound of pay-load that
the missile can lift to orbiting altitude.
Thus, any significant reduction in mis-
sile weight achieved by substituting light-
weight, high-strength quartz fiber means
an increase in precious pay-load capacity.
Describing the new product, Engineer-
ing Manager Kenneth D. Scott, told how
the quartz thread starts with continuous
fused quartz fibers. Almost invisible,
these monofilaments are approximately
.0005 inch in diameter, 1/5 the diameter
of a human hair, Scott said. Several
hundred of these monofilaments are
twisted, plied into yarn, and woven into
fabric, he explained. The unique result
has the basic properties of glass fabric,
the very high temperature resistance of
quartz, and good tensile strength at ele-
vated temperatures.
He pointed out further properties
which make quartz a material unequalled
for many applications; its purity, low
thermal conductivity, extremely low co-
efficient of expansion, high softening
point, and high viscosity.
For that soft frosted effect in auto trim
parts a new finish called "Fro-Zin" has
been developed. It makes use of a new
semi-blasting technique.

BUILDI

A NEWS RELEASE
Plans for a permanent "moon build-
ing" to house living quarters for
moon explorers, laboratories for scien-
tific research, maintenance shops for
space vehicles and stations for earth-
moon communications have been an-
nounced by the Wonder Building Cor-
poration of America, Chicago.
A detailed 5 by 6 foot scale model
of the structure—a cigar shaped corru-
gated metal cylinder covered by a pro-
tective metal "meteoric shield"—was re-
cently unveiled to military and federal
government officials at a presentation in
Washington, D.C.
Because of the present lack of knowl-
edge and great divergence of opinion
concerning the moon's surface, the moon
building has been designed for the worst
condition anticipated—a sea of dust
upon which the building would float,
anchored by heavy weights suspended
by cables from the body of the structure.
If the moon's surface proves to be solid,
it could then provide normal support
for the building.
In its true size, the moon building
would be 340 feet long, 160 feet wide
and 65 feet high. Including air lock
and plastic observation bubble, it would
measure 520 feet in length. The build-
ing would be fabricated of aluminum
alloys which combine high strength and
low weight with ease of fabrication.
Aluminum also provides a good reflecting
surface which eases cooling problems.
Above and separated from the roof
of the building is a slightly curved um-
brella-shaped protective meteoric shield,
designed to ward off the gnatlike rain
of interplanetary meteoric dust which
descends with great velocity on the bar-
ren surface of the moon. The shield
would be 460 feet long, 280 feet wide
and 83 feet high.
The entire shell of the building, and
the protective barrier, would be fabri-
cated of pre-engineered metal sheets se-
cured by simple nut and bolt fasteners
and welded structural connections. A

off the thought barrier
Over the years, we have been hearing of many "bar-
riers" in science . . . the sound barrier, the water
barrier, the thermal barrier.
Of all the barriers, the hardest one to break through
has always been the thought barrier. Every one of
these "barriers" has been conquered by men to whom
the word, impossible, means:" hasn't been done, yet."
The sound barrier is a shattered concept, as dis-
credited as the phlogistic theory.
Don Campbell's Bluebird stopped all talk of the
water barrier.
The heat of air friction against the metal "skin"
of an airplane was supposed to create a heat barrier
at Mach 3. Materials now in production can safely
withstand the much higher temperatures involved in
flight at Mach 5.
Today the thermal barrier is being called the
"thermal thicket"—evidence in itself that no barrier
exists.
An interesting point that all of these "barriers"
have in common: each was conquered with the help
of nickel-containing alloys.
This is not surprising when you stop to consider
how many useful properties and combinations of
properties are offered by the various nickel alloys:
Corrosion resistance to a wide variety of solids,
liquids and gases . . . strength at high temperatures
. . . toughness at sub-zero temperatures . . . unusual
electrical properties . . . ability to protect product
purity . . . spring properties.

gate Nickel and its alloys. Inco's List "A" and List

the
Individual

Training at DuPont begins the day the
new graduate joins the Company, and
it continues throughout his career. He
is usually given a specific assignment
at once, so he learns informally in con-
sultation with his supervisor and his
associates assigned to the same project
This informal approach to training is
supplemented by frequent meetings and
seminars and by scheduled perform-
ance reviews by each man's supervisor.
It is partly through this method of
training that DuPont develops its man-
agement men of tomorrow. And the
need is increasing every day for quali-
fied people to supervise the develop-
ment, production and distribution of
new products as well as Du Pont's 1200
existing products and product lines.
So if you join DuPont you can be sure
that you will retain your identity as an
individual and be prepared for ad-
vancement as quickly as your abilities
—and job openings—permit.

feet; bituminous materials — 995,000
tons; petroleum products—122,994,000
gallons; explosives—18,345,000 tons.
For each $1 billion increased capacity,
the industry will also need an extra
57,000 machines costing a total of $550
million. With all these demands, the
industry planners foresee no shortage
in materials, if severe strikes do not
cripple them. The only shortage will be
in engineers. Colleges and universities
are not graduating enough civil engi-
neers to keep up with the present de-
mand, much less the demands of the new
program. Over the planned fifteen year
construction period the road construction
industry will use a grand total of 439
million tons of steel, cement, and bitumi-
nous materials. With the crushed rock
they plan to use as the base of the
highways, they could build 500 pyramids
the size of Cheop's Pyramid, four city
blocks square and 40 stories tall!
Ask any motorist and he will tell you
why the new highways are necessary.
The present roads are a mess. Many of
our so-called "first class roads" were
built for 1940 traffic loads, which are
now totally inadequate. Most of the
roads we now drive on were built during
World War II and the traffic load has
increased on them more than 70% since
the war. In order to stop abuse by large
trucks, load and axle weight limitations
will be strictly enforced on the new high-
ways. The limits are 18,000 lbs. on a
single axle and 32,000 lbs. on tandem
axles. The gross weight of the trucks
cannot exceed 73,200 lbs. The width
limit is 96 inches or the state limit on
July 1, 1956, whichever is greater.
Many problems have cropped up to
plague and stall the highway planners.
The people concerned with billboard
construction and sale have created a loud
furor over the fact that the planners
hope to eliminate billboard advertising
and let the motorists see the countryside
along the new freeways. The billboard
people are afraid that their jobs will be
cut off. Some people want unlimited
access to the new freeways, thus doing
away with interchanges. Without these,
however, the new roads will end up in
a maze like the present ones. Inflation
is another worry of the planners and
financiers. They are going to find it very
difficult to hold the costs down to the
original estimates. The new plan calls
for roads to pass through cities, which
means unified planning between the city
and the state: something that hasn't
worked out too well in the past. More-
over, some states are slower getting
started than others, meaning there will
be just a patchwork of roads until the
whole project is completed.
The only unpleasant aspect of the new
highway program is that somebody has
to pay for it. Main target to provide
the almost $50 billion needed for the
entire project is John Q. Cardriver,
namely you and I. For almost three
years now, John Q. has been paying an
extra penny for every gallon of gasoline
and diesel fuel he has used, three cents
for every pound of tires he has used,
and 8 to 10% more tax for buses,
trucks, and trailers that he bought. In
addition, John Q's trucks weighing over
13 tons have to pay an extra yearly
registration fee of $1.50 per 1000 lbs.
It is estimated, however, that John Q.
will save four cents per mile in operating
expenses by using the new freeways
rather than the present roads. Most of
this new tax money goes to the federal
government since it is paying 90% of
the bill and the individual states are
paying only 10%.
You may be wondering how these
41,000 miles of new highways can cost
$24 billion. Actually, the cost of super-
highway construction is fantastically
large. Just to build a freeway in Kansas,
with not too many towns and inter-
changes to consider, costs $250,000 per
mile. In more developed New Hamp-
shire, the cost rises to $500,000 per mile.
An expressway in Chicago cost $10 mil-
lion for one mile, and the New Jersey
link to the Holland Tunnel with its
many overpasses and interchanges cost
a whopping $15 million per mile. Massa-
chusett's Turnpike, which is used as one
of the models of the new Interstate
system, cost $2 million per mile. Of
course, this cost will be less in less-
settled areas where only two lanes will
be built.
Even if all the aforementioned bene-
fits do not convince you that the new
freeways will be beneficial, the Automo-
tive Safety Council has estimated that
the new highways wil cut the yearly
traffic death rate of 35,000 by 10%.
Surely this will convince the firmest
skeptic that the new roads are not only
beneficial, but necessary.

a high relative speed between tape and
recording head. Instead of moving just
the coated ribbon, the Ampex recorder
moved both tape and recording head. In
this way, the tape was slowed to the
standard audio speed and fidelity was
preserved.
In addition, it was decided that the
extremely wide bandwidth required for
video could not be resolved on tape. Sig-
nals ranging from DC to five mega-
cycles were usually encountered. To elim-
inate this, Ampex employed an FM mod-
ulator to convert the usual AM video
signal to an FM waveform with fre-
quencies in the narrower bandwidth
from 1.5 mc to 6.5 mc. Let us look
more closely at the Ampex recorder VR-
1000.
Ampex VR-1000
The VR-1000 uses a two inch wide
tape that moves at fifteen inches per sec-
ond. In a plane perpendicular to the
motion of the tape, there is mounted a
flat disk on a motor shaft. Under oper-
ating conditions the motor runs at 14,000
rpm. The motor-disk assembly is mounted
so that the edge of the disk is tangent to
the tape. When the disk rotates, four
recording heads mounted on the rim of
the disk maintain continuous contact
with the tape. To insure this intimate
contact, a tape guide is furnished which
shapes the tape to the curvature of the
disk. The motion of the disk is such
that when the tape is moving, and the
disk is rotating, the four recording heads
move across the tape from one edge to
the other at a writing speed of 1500
inches per second. Certainly, this is far
better than the rapid tape system. For
illustration see Fig. 1.
It is obvious that with relative motion
of this sort, difficulties concerning con-
stand speed do arise. Ampex doubted
that they could maintain absolutely con-
stant speed with any motor. Synchronous
motors which depend for their speed on
the frequency of the current applied to
them are the most perfect in this regard.
As long as line frequency is constant, the
motor speed will be fixed. But any vari-
ation in line frequency will cause a corre-
sponding change in the motor speed. To
prevent this from occurring, a narrow
band along the edge of the tape records

information concerning the frequency of
the power applied to the motor during
recording. When playback is desired, an
adjustment can be automatically made to
assure that at every moment of the play-
back, the motor moves at the same speed
as during recording.
Note in Fig. 1 that the curved guide
for the tape subtends about 120° and
the four recording heads are 90° apart.
Through this arrangement, continual con-
tact between the tape and one of the
heads is assured. Each head will be in
contact with the tape for about 30° of
rotation before it is switched into use.
During this brief period, definite con-
tact can be established and undesirable
transients eliminated.
High Quality Tape Necessary
Under the Ampex arrangement, very
high quality tape is required. Small wave-
lengths must be carefully recorded since
imperfections of 1/10 of a wavelength
cause the signal to drop out. If there is
an imperfection in the coating .00003
inches long, the intimate contact between
disk and tape is momentarily discontin-
ued and the signal is partially lost. This
results in a blank on the screen. There-
fore, perfect sterility is imperative during
manufacture.
Very strong plastic tapes are neces-
sary. Just consider that the recording
head is moving across the tape at over
120 miles per hour and exerting on the
tape a pressure of 20,000 psi! Friction
becomes quite a problem under these
conditions, making heat resistant plastics
indispensable.
Other problems with the manufacture
of the special Videotape arose. Most
efficient recording is accomplished when
the recording head moves parallel to the
grain of the magnetic crystals. But in
manufacture these crystals run along the
length of the tape. Special processes to
turn the crystals, aligning them with the
direction of the tape head, across the
width of the tape, had to be worked out.
These and other difficulties in tape man-
ufacture have still not been completely
solved. Fifty percent of all tape com-
pleted must be discarded because of some
imperfection. Indeed, it is poor practice
to scrap one of every two rolls of Video-
tape at the price of $306 per roll.
Having worked out these many pro-
cedures, Ampex engineers have been able
to solve most of the major problems of
video tape recording. Where a nineteen
inch roll of quarter inch width tape
played for only four minutes with rela-
tively poor definition, now a twelve inch
reel of two inch wide tape will play
for a full hour. The tape can be record-
ed and erased one hundred times before
it becomes useless. Clarity is better than
is theoretically possible on the home re-
ceiver.
In recent months, now that there are
over a hundred video tape systems in
commercial use, the same equipment is
being applied to color TV. One year ago,
RCA announced that they would have a
color video tape recording console ready
for marketing in December, 1958. Con-
sidering that five years ago, black and
white systems were far from the com-
mercial market and that the principles
ultimately standardized were not yet con-
ceived, this is certainly a marvelous ad-
vancement.
Although other companies have supple-
mented the original Ampex system, we
must not forget their pioneering efforts.
By thinking imaginatively, this group of
engineers was able to design a video
tape system giving to the television world
a little drama and a great addition to
basic television equipment.

caught redhanded, by ordering him to
walk up and down, past the seven col-
umns of the temple of Diana, counting
them until he reached the one-thousandth
column. The columns were in one line
and the slave was supposed to count
them by walking from the left to right.
When he reached the seventh he was to
turn and count the sixth as the eighth,
moving from the right to the left. When
he again reached the first column, he
was to turn and count by moving left
to right again. After finishing his march,
he was to report to the mathematican
which column had been the one-thou-
sandth. The mathematician, however, had
easily calculated the answer. He just sat
back and waited for the slave to finish.

ME Test Problem:
A crosseyed woodpecker with a cork
leg and synthetic rubber bill required
one-half hour to peck one-fourth of the
distance through a cypress log 53 years
old. Shingles cost 79 cents per hundred
and weigh eight pound apiece. The log
being pecked upon is 34 feet long and
weighs 46 pounds per foot. Assuming
that the coefficient of friction between
the woodpecker's bill and the cypress
log is 0.047 and there is negligible re-
sistance to diffusion, how many units of
vitamin B, will the woodpecker require
in pecking out enough shingles for a
$75,000 barn with detachable chicken
house? The woodpecker has an efficiency
of 97% and gets time and a half for
overtime.

INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
Ind lstrial Engineering is concerned with the design, improvement and installation of integrated systems of men,
materials and equipment; drawing upon specialized knowledge and skill in the mathematical, physical and
social sciences, together with the principles and methods of engineering analysis and design, to specify, pre-
dict, and evaluate the results to be obtained from such systems.
The Industrial Engineer is primarily interested in problems which involve economy in the use of money,
materials, time human effort and energy. The Industrial Engineer should combine the aptitudes of an engineer,
accountant and business executive. About one-half of the program of study for the B.S.E. degree consists of
basic science and engineering courses, accompanied by studies in the humanities. The rest of the work is in
areas such as plant analysis work and compensation, evaluation, operations research, engineering economy,
production engineering, probability and statistics, organization and management, including the use of new
mathematical techniques for solving industrial problems. As an aid to education the department has a well
equipped laboratory.

MAN' FIRST PROBE INTO SPACE
(Continued from page 15)
Flight Purpose
The purpose of this first manned space
flight and the many flights that follow
is to collect preliminary information on:
1. Structural problems in airloads, as
well as aerodynamic heating and
accelerations.
2. Aerodynamic control, stability, and
maneuverability in the atmosphere,
on its fringes, and in outer space
at hypersonic velocities.
3. Human factors, such as the effect
of weightlessness and accelerations.
4. Flight techniques for re-entry and
deceleration which are two critical
areas.
5. Later flights will involve testing
new materials.
The bulk of research measurements
will be made with onboard equipment.
Vital information concerning the pilot
will also be obtained, such as his body
temperature, heart beat, and so forth.
Much of the information obtained by
the instruments in the plane will be re-
corded and some will be directly relayed
to information centers on the ground.
Not one, but three identical X-15's
will be built and used simultaneously.
After the initial flight into space, many
varied tests will be carried out using
these three crafts. Two and even three
flights a day might be accomplished, us-
ing all three vehicles, or day-after-day
flights might be made, using the vehicles
in sequence.
North American has thus designed a
craft which, with minor modifications, is
capable of orbiting flight. With the vari-
ations available in boosters and in possi-
ble propellant combinations, the X-15
may someday carry man into prolonged
space flight. Even if the X-15 is used
solely for short hops into space, the in-
formation obtained from these flights
should clear a path for the fast approach-
ing era of manned space flight.
MOON BUILDING
(Continued from page 42)
unique "Truss-Skin" design developed
by the Wonder Building firm provides
completely useable interiors, without in-
ternal supports of any kind.
With space at a premium inside the
moon building, the trusslike concept
would eliminate space wasted by ordi-
nary structural supports, while the pre-
engineered design would permit quick
erection with minimum labor and tools.
Inside the moon building are:
• Living quarters, including rooms for
sleeping, cooking, eating, and recreation.
• Physics, chemistry and biological
laboratories.
• A control tower for communication,
meteorological studies, earth observations,
astronomical observations, traffic control,
etc.
• Air conditioning, heating, power and
refrigeration plants, oxygen producing
units, extreme-temperature regulating de-
vices, water supply and sewage processing
plans.
• Machine shop and equipment main-
tenance areas.
Entrance to the moon building is
made through an airlock at one end,
adjacent to which would be constructed
a rocket landing area. Complete internal
pressurization of the hermetically-sealed
building provides an air pressure of at
least 10 pounds per square inch, close
to earth's normal atmospheric pressure
of 14.7 pounds, the same pressure as
used in high altitude airliners.
Special refrigerating and heating plants
cope with the extreme temperatures and
tremendous gradients which abound on
the moon. Day and night on the moon
are about two weeks long, with tempera-
tures at lunar midday reaching 214 de-
grees F; at sunset, 32 degrees F, and at
midnight, —243 degrees F.
There are no windows in the moon
building, since ultraviolet radiation nor-
mally absorbed by the earth's atmosphere,
would be sufficiently intense to render
panes or plastic useless through discolor-
ation. Metal shutters protect the plastic
observation bubbles.

than just the size of the FISH
and the size of the POND
O
We've been told that an engineering graduate is frequently attracted to
companies our size because of his understandable human desire to be "a big
fish in a little pond".
While it is true that (numerically speaking) our employee team is small
compared to some, we encounter great difficulty in trying to think of Sikorsky
Aircraft as a "little pond". Our contributions to the field of rotary-winged
aircraft have not been small, nor can our field be considered limited or pro-
fessionally confining. Quite the contrary. Sikorsky Aircraft is the company
which pioneered the modern helicopter; atid our field today is recognized as
one of the broadest and most challenging in the entire aircraft industry.
And what of the size of the "fish"?
Unquestionably, that is a matter involving your own indi-
vidual potential for growth. Like any far-sighted company,
we're always willing to talk with "young whales"!

Statics and dynamics are fundamental
to all studies in engineering mechanics,
but they are also quite wide in their
scope. Statics concerns itself with the
effects of forces on bodies in equilibrium.
Dynamics, on the other hand, is the study
of bodies in motion, and consists of two
separate fields—kinematics and kinetics.
Kinematics is the study of motion with-
out consideration of forces, while kinetics
encompasses both forces and motion. The
relationships of dynamics are essential to
the guidance and control of ballistic
misssiles, for the trajectory of a missile
is determined from the kinetic relation-
ships and the controls depend upon the
effect of forces on the vehicle.
Strength of materials is the study of
the effects of forces on engineering
materials, and the use of resulting re-
lationships for engineering applications.
Elementary courses in this area deal with
problems of elastic stress and strain
arising from the application of forces to
structures. Advanced courses encompass
the plasticity of materials, and it is the
plastic deformation of materials that is
becoming more important to engineers.
For example, the nose-cone of the Red-
stone missile is designed in the plastic
range so that it deforms while re-entering
the earth's atmosphere, but will still
deliver its payload. By designing in the
plastic range a considerable weight re-
duction is possible.
Fluid mechanics deals with the prop-
erties of fluids, both compressible and
incompressible, and concerns itself with
such factors as force, energy, and vis-
cosity. Supersonic flight and rocket pro-
pulsion are some of the areas of ad-
vanced study in this field, and some
important applications are in the field of
pneumatic and hydraulic servo-mechan-
isms (i.e., controlling device) used in
missiles. Servo-mechanisms are used to
control such important functions as fuel
mixing and guidance manipulations.
Present Curriculum
The current program leading to a
degree of Bachelor of Science in Engi-
neering (Engineering Mechanics) is de-
signed to prepare the student to integrate
the science of mechanics with engineering
applications.
Like all engineering students at the
University, the engineering mechanics
student must fulfill the requirements of
professional subjects, and can do so
under either the "traditional" or the
"science" engineering sequence. These
courses include basic instruction in Eng-
lish, math, physics and chemistry. The
English courses develop the student's
ability to communicate both in writing
and in speech, and they also stimulate
his interest in literature. Mathematics,
the most fundamental engineering subject,
will, if mastered, aid immeasurably in
the student's subsequent work. Survey
courses in physics and chemistry familiar-
ize the student with two sciences which

have made great contributions to engi-
neering and are in themselves engineer-
ing specialties. Collectively these pro-
fessional subjects comprise approximately
35% (ie., 44-53 credit hours) of an
engineer's academic work.
For his foundation in mechanics, the
engineering mechanics student is required
to take advanced courses in both engi-
neering mechanics and mathematics. The
math requirement is necessary because
of its use in the treatment of advanced
engineering mechanics courses. At least
nine credit hours of math are required
beyond sophomore year calculus. The
engineering mechanics requirements can
include subjects such as the theory of
plasticity, vibration analysis or the me-
chanics of inviscid fluids, and together
with the math requirements give the stu-
dent a specialized background, which also
comprise about 35% (i.e., 42 credit
hours) of his academic work.
The remainder of the program is com-
posed of miscellaneous subjects, such as
economics and non-technical electives,
and a sequence in one of twelve other
engineering programs, such as aerody-
namics, electronics, hydraulics, instrumen-
tation and structures. This minor field
forms an area of application for the
student's special background in me-
chanics, and in this field he is better
prepared to handle a special problem in-
volving mechanics than the engineer who
was trained for the field.
Opportunities For E.M. Students
The engineering mechanics student
with a bachelor's degree is as suited for
graduate work as any other type of engi-
neer, and he can profitably continue his
academic work to the master's or doctor's
level.
With a bachelor's, master's or doctor's
degree the engineering mechanics grad-
uate is probably best suited for research
and development. This is to his advan-
tage, for civilian industry is emphasizing
more and more research and develop-
ment for new and better products, while
national defense spending is also creat-
ing a critical shortage of such engineers.
Progressive corporations and defense in-
dustries are increasing their specific re-
quests for engineering mechanics gradu-
ates.
Not only is mechanics becoming more
necessary to old engineering functions,
but new fields are developing which
can best be filled by engineering me-
chanics graduates. The age of airplanes
and missiles requires careful application
of mechanics to minimize overdesign
and increase reliability. Topics such as
vibration engineering present needs
which can best be filled by the engineer-
ing mechanics graduate. The increasing
complexity of the technical world fore-
shadows the continued growth of engi-
neering mechanics, and the continued
demand for engineering mechanics grad-
uates.

Where do you find better advancement
opportunities—in a large company or a
small one? To help you, the college
student, resolve that problem, Mr. Abbott
answers the following questions con-
cerning advancement opportunities in
engineering, manufacturing and tech-
nical marketing at General Electric.
Q. In a large Company such as General
Electric, how can you assure that every
man deserving of recognition will get it?
Don't some capable people become lost?
A. No, they don't. And it's be-
cause of the way G.E. has been
organized. By decentralizing into
more than a hundred smaller oper-
ating departments, we've been able
to pinpoint both authority and re-
sponsibility. Our products are engi-
neered, manufactured and marketed
by many departments comparable
to small companies. Since each is
completely responsible for its success
and profitability, each individual
within the department has a defined
share of that responsibility. There-
fore, outstanding performance is
readily recognized.
Q. If that's the case, are opportunities
for advancement limited to openings
within the department?
A. Not at all. That's one of the
advantages of our decentralized
organization. It creates small oper-
ations that individuals can "get their
arms around", and still reserves and
enhances the inherent advantages of
a large company. Widely diverse
opportunities and promotions are
available on a Company-wide basis.
Q. But how does a department find the
best man. Company-wide?
A. We've developed personnel reg-
isters to assure that the best quali-
fied men for the job are not over-
looked. The registers contain corn-

plete appraisals of professional em-
ployees. They enable a manager to
make a thorough and objective
search of the entire General Electric
Company and come up with the
man best qualified for the job.
Q. How do advancement opportunities
for technical graduates stack-up with
those of other graduates?
A. Very well. General Electric is
recognized as a Company with out-
standing technical skills and facili-
ties. One out of every thirteen em-
ployees is a scientist or engineer.
And approximately 50 per cent of
our Department General Managers
have technical backgrounds.
Q. How about speed of advancement?
Is G.E. a "young man's Company"?
A. Definitely. A majority of all
supervisors, managers and outstand-
ing individual contributors working
in the engineering function are below
the age of forty. We believe that a
job should be one for which you are
qualified, but above all it should be
one that challenges your ability. As
you master one job we feel that
consideration should be given to
moving you to a position of greater
responsibility. This is working, for
in the professional field, one out of
four of our people are in positions of
greater responsibility today than
they were a year ago.
Q. Some men want to remain in a
specialized technical job rather than go
into managerial work. How does this
affect their advancement?
A. At G.E. there are many paths
which lead to higher positions of
recognition and prestige. Every man
is essentially free to select the course
which best fits both his abilities and
interests. Furthermore, he may mod-
ify that course if his interests change
as his career progresses. Along any
of these paths he may advance
within the Company to very high
levels of recognition and salary.
Q. What aids to advancement does
General Electric provide?
A. We believe that it's just sound
business policy to provide a stimu-
lating climate for personal develop-
ment. As the individual develops,
through his own efforts, the Com-
pany benefits from his contributions.
General Electric has done much to
provide the right kind of opportu-
nity for its employees. Outstanding
college graduates are given graduate
study aid through the G-E Honors
Program and Tuition Refund Pro-
gram. Technical graduates entering
the Engineering, Manufacturing, or
Technical Marketing Programs start
with on-the-job training and related
study as preparation for more re-
sponsible positions. Throughout
their G-E careers they receive fre-
quent appraisals as a guide for self
development. Company-conducted
courses are offered again at all
levels of the organization. These
help professionals gain the increas-
ingly higher levels of education
demanded by the complexities of
modern business. Our goal is to see
every man advance to the full limits
of his capabilities.

APRIL, 1959


Students Dedicate Plaque
"Educator, Inspiring Teacher, Vigorous Leader,
Prominent Engineer . . ." reads the inscription.
For one climactic moment, the unveiled plaque
stands before that small group of persons in a most
unique form. This group were gathered in a quiet
room of the Michigan Union on the morning of
April 6, 1959. Their calling was to consecrate this
plaque in honor of George Granger Brown, the late
Dean of the College of Engineering.
Yet the plaque was only a mute testimonial of
the achievement of a great man—the true greatness
was realized in the minds of those persons who had
gazed at the suggestive inscription. For one, Brown
was a prominent engineer, contributing his talent
to the welfare of mankind; for another, he may
have been an educator, where his knowledge found
new uses; and for a third, his dynamic and respected
leadership seemed most outstanding.
Brown had been connected with the University
since 1920 when he joined the faculty as an in-
structor in chemical and metallurgical engineering.
In just ten years, he had advanced to a professorship,
and later, chairman of his department. Again, he
was honored in 1947 when his title was changed
to Edward DeMille Campbell University Professor
of Chemical Engineering, a recognition that was
bestowed on only eight professors at that time.
George Granger Brown's great capacity for leader-
ship was fully realized beginning in 1951, at which
time he was appointed Dean of the College.
Soon after the death of the Dean in 1957, an
idea was fostered in the Engineering Council to
honor this great man. Traditionally, outstanding
men of the College have been memorialized in the
form of a plaque erected in the Engine Arch. The
Council was presented with this idea in the fall of
1957 and reacted with great enthusiasm and ap-
proval.
James Shedlowsky was appointed the chairman
of the committee designed to raise the necessary
funds, hire an architect, and handle other arrange-
ments. Shedlowsky's work was carried on by Jon
Erickson during the next semester. During that
school year, Mr. James E. Miller of the Art Depart-
ment was contracted to design and construct the
plaque. Also, a widespread donation campaign was
inaugurated among the faculty and a bucket drive
in the Engineering buildings allowed students to
express their respect for their former dean.
In the fall of 1958, the Council appointed Roger
Barnes to handle the final arrangements for the
plaque. The Dean Brown Memorial Fund was
further increased by a large donation from the
Council who had raised the money by sponsoring
the Playboys' Prance and a Cinema Guild movie.
The necessary goal of money needed was reached
early this Spring when the faculty came through
again with a substantial number of contributions.
The plaque itself was then finished and was
dedicated on April 6. In order that all students,
faculty, and visitors may see the work, the plaque
has been mounted in the lobby of the Fluids Labora-
tory on North Campus.
Students honoring the late Dean has obviously
been the central theme throughout the entire plaque
project, from the fostering of the idea to the dedi-
cation. Students conceived the project, raised a
large portion of the money, and handled all arrange-
ments. What better honor could anyone bestow on
a respected educator in the University than to have
his students be the integral part in the setting up
of an everlasting memorial in the form of the plaque?

Frank Willard joined Westinghouse in 1954—
now designing punched card control systems
At 28, Frank G. Willard, a 1953 BA and MSEE gradu-
ate of Dartmouth College, is already one of very few
experts in an entirely new area in electrical engineering.
Now a development engineer in the Westinghouse Con-
trol Division at Buffalo, N. Y., Frank is specializing in
advanced industrial control systems. He helped to de-
velop PROD AC* control, the first programmed digital
automatic control system for heavy industry; he was
responsible for the first industrial application of com-
putor-type magnetic core information storage; and,
through major creative work in logic circuits, he was a
key man in the team which designed the first completely
automatic blooming mill control system for the
steel industry.
Most important, Frank Willard is doing exactly what
he wants to be doing. Upon completion of the Westing-
house Student Training Course, he was assigned to the
Control Division and, soon thereafter, was selected to
attend the Westinghouse Advanced Design Course at
the University of Pittsburgh. He has submitted 12
patent disclosures; and he has 8 U. S. patents pending.

The newest of the big campus traditions makes
its debut at Michigan next month.
by BARRY PEEBLES, '60E
The Engineering Arch as seen
several years ago. The greenery
will soon be apparent on campus
as the Engineers' Weekend ap-
proaches—those three days when
the engineers will take over the
campus.
East, West, North, and South. Cam-
pus, community, state, and nation.
From all directions and all areas hun-
dreds of people will be aiming for just
one thing on May 7, 8, 9—the 1959
Engineer's Weekend.
From the nation will come industrial
corporations with interesting, educational
exhibits and the Weekend's keynote
speaker. From the state will come 1800
high school students for the annual Uni-
versity Day. From the community will
come people from all walks of life to
find out what engineers are and what
they do. From the campus will come
special speakers, elaborate exhibits and
demonstrations by local technical socie-
ties and, most important, students from
every college and school in the Univer-
sity.
Why all the effort and preparation for
this gigantic undertaking? The reason is
two-fold. First, to promote an under-
standing of engineers and engineering
by high school students, the university
community, and the public in general.
Second, to instill in the engineering stu-
dent body an "esprit de corps" by unit-
ing them behind this common project.
Since early February the E-Weekend
Central Committee, under the sponsor-
ship of the Engineering Council, has
been laying plans and making prepara-
tions for this event. A glimpse of these
plans was given above—now the details.
Early in March about 100 letters were
sent out to industrial firms and corpora-
tions inviting them to set up displays and
exhibits for the three-day affair. About
20 or 30 of these companies are expec-
ted to be on hand when the big day
arrives several weeks hence. At about
this same time in March local technical
societies, in conjunction with department
faculty members, began making plans for
their own display or demonstration.
These exhibits will form the founda-
tion for the first annual "Weekend,"
but this is only part of the story. The
special events committee has been busy
arranging for three or four special cam-
pus speakers, including several well-
known professors from other schools of
the University as well as a prominent
engineering faculty member. All of these
interesting talks will be in addition to
the nationally known person who will
deliver the keynote address on Thursday
evening. This committee has also made
arrangements for class elections and the
Frosh-Soph Tug-O-War to be held dur-
ing the Weekend. It is also rumored that
an honorary initiation may take place.
A special feature of E-Weekend that
will be of interest to many engineering
students as well as outsiders is a North
Campus Open-House during one after-
noon of the Weekend. Efforts are now
being made to arrange free bus service
from the Arch and back for this occas-
sion.
The exact schedule of these events, in-
cluding the times of speakers and loca-
tions of the various exhibits, will be
available in a special 20 page program
booklet at the start of the Weekend.
Admitedly this has been only a brief
look behind the scenes of this newcomer
to campus traditions but in just a few
short days the curtain will go up on
Engineer's Weekend—1959.

LANDINGS
Getting an airplane over the terminal is one
problem, but a far greater problem is guiding
the planes into the airport in all kinds of weath-
er.
Since February's crash of an
American Airlines' Electra in New
York's East River, the safety spot-
light has swung from methods of con-
trolling airways to methods of landing
the airplanes once they are over the
airport.
In this crash, the Flagship New
York was attempting a bad weather
landing at La Guardia Airport with
clouds down to 400 feet, two mile
visibility, and a freezing rain. The
plane flew over the final checkpoint
three miles from the runway and
descended for its landing. Moments
later the plane crashed into the East
River, lined up with the runway but
a few thousand feet short. The crash
killed 65 of the 73 persons aboard.
The runway that the ill-fated plane
was attempting to land on was not
equipped with a complete Instrument
Landing System. If it were, the plane
probably could have landed safely,
saving 65 lives.
by PETE HAMMERTON, '62E
"Air Force Three-Seven-One, this is
Willow Run control. Visibility is one-
half mile with clouds down to 200 feet.
There is a light rain on the field."
"This is Air Force Three-Seven-One.
I understand. Request permission to
make an instrument landing."
"Three-Seven-One, this is Willow Run.
Permission granted."
As you are reading this article, some-
where in the country an airplane is re-
peating a conversation similar to the one
above and making a landing in poor
weather. Coming down through clouds,
rain, or storms, airplanes are able to
reach the runway and land safely with-
out even seeing the runway.
Bad Weather Landings Necessary
All-weather landing capability is a
necessity. Without it, long range flights
would be impossible since the weather
Ground controlled approach systems
utilize two radar scopes. The one at the
left shows all aircraft around the air-
port, while the one on the right shows
an individual in relation to the estab-
lished glide path.

Pete Hammerton, '62E, a recent
addition to the Technic articles staff
is aiming for a degree in Aero-
nautical Engineering. Pete, a grad-
uate of Royal Oak High School in
Michigan, has just received a nom-
ination to the USAF Academy for
the class entering in June, 1959.
Along with technical writing
Pete's interests include reading

ming, and Hi-Fi.

completely after an airplane takes off
from Los Angeles. Even more important
would be the complete uselessness of the
interceptors guarding America against
a sneak attack, since modern aircraft can
fly above clouds and storms and bomb
targets by radar. It is therefore easy to
see that bad weather landings are a neces-
sity to the national economy and defense.
However, what type of a device would
make it possible for a pilot to land when
he can't even see the wing tips of his air-
plane?
The two systems currently used con-
sist of recently developed radar and radio
techniques. In the Instrument Landing
System (ILS) radio beams direct the
pilot to the runway, while in Ground
Control Approach (GCA) landings a
man on the ground watches the plane on
a radarscope and tells the pilot where to
fly in order to reach the runway. Both
systems have their advantages and disad-
vantages.
Instrument Landing System
The ILS system has two primary com-
ponents; the localizer which tells the
pilot in which direction to fly, and the
glide path, which tells him how high
to fly. These are radio beams which
broadcast a certain signal in a certain
direction. The localizer broadcasts its
signal along a line extended through the
center of the runway for a distance of

ten miles in both directions. The beam is
5° wide which makes the signal approxi-
mately seventy feet wide at the end of
the runway and one mile wide ten miles
from the end of the runway. It sends
out a signal on the left side of the ex-
tended center line and a different signal
on the right side of the line. When a
pilot is flying exactly down the extended
center line the two signals are equal in
intensity. At this position the needle of
the localizer pointer in the cockpit is
centered. If he flies to the left of center
the needle swings to the right, indicating
he should fly in this direction to get back
on the center line.
The glide path, or altitude indicator,
works on the same principle. It is
directed upwards 2l^° with a height
of approximately one degree. The beam
is about 1400 feet thick ten miles out.

an angle of 2y2° the needle on the glide

Revolution
Higher power and gas economy — both can be
yours if you have a fuel injection system in your
car. by RAY IKOLA, '62E
It's cold outside. You hesitantly press
the starter of your automobile half-
expecting the engine to remain silent.
To your delight, however, it roars into
life and idles quietly and smoothly. Driv-
ing away you are at once aware of the
smooth acceleration with no "flat" spots
noticeable. You are aware that this new
car you are driving has much more "pep"
than your old one. No doubt it is
equipped with a fuel injection system,
the revolutionary new method of fuel
feeding. It certainly is a pleasure to drive
this car!
Fuel injection is claimed by many to
be the biggest revolution in the automo-
tive industry since the development of
the high-compression V-8 engine. Al-
though the type of fuel injection system
varies with the manufacturer, they all
claim the same general attributes. The
chief selling points are: (1) a boost in
the horsepower output by 10-20%; (2)
an increase in the gasoline mileage by 5-
15%; and (3) better cold weather start-
ing is achieved.
Replaces Carburetor
What is this magical device which can
perform these feats? Basically a fuel
injection system is a method of fuel feed-
ing in the automobile engine which re-
places the carburetor by separating the
functions of vaporizing the fuel and sup-
plying the air. The carburetor engine has
long had many drawbacks. For instance,
fuel is not fed to each cylinder in exactly
the same amount. This is due to the
clumsiness of the manifold system in
metering the fuel. The effect is that dif-
ferent cylinders are caused to operate at
different temperatures. At high engine
speeds there is a difficulty in supplying
a sufficient amount of air to the cylinders
because the intake manifold is necessarily
small. If it were made larger, the air
would move too slowly and the gas vapor
would condense in the manifold. Also a
carburetor requires heat in order to
vaporize the gas for delivery to the cylin-
ders. This heat causes the air to expand,
thereby making it less dense. This all
necessitates the use of several devices that
help maintain the combustion efficiency,
such as higher compression ratios, and
leaded fuels. Among other faults of the
carburetor engine are the problems of
changing bowl level due to the motion
of the car, and the tendency of many
fuels to separate out in the manifold
causing the cylinders to receive fuel with
different octane ratings. The fuel injec-
tion system, due to its inherent design,
bypasses these faults.
Essentially the idea of fuel injection
is to deliver the air and the fuel to the
cylinder without vaporizing the fuel and
mixing it with the air first. Instead the
fuel is injected into the cylinder by
spraying it from a small nozzle just ahead
of the intake valve. This means that the
air is brought to the cylinder cold and
dense, making it easier to maintain the

Fi to instrumental music.

his home town radio station
(WJPD) as a staff announcer.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


In most fuel injection systems, the fuel is delivered just ahead of the intake
valve. Since there is only air in the manifold, it can be brought to the cylinder
cold and dense, thereby making it easier to maintain the ideal combustion ratio.
ideal combustion ratio of 15 parts of air
to 1 part of fuel. Although fuel injec-
tion as used on diesel engines and some
aircraft engines delivers the fuel directly
to the combustion chamber, this method
is not commonly used in conventional
automobile engines.
Two Basic Systems
There are two basic types of fuel in-
jection systems, namely, the continuous
flow system and the timed system. Since
the continuous flow system is simpler
and more generally used than the timed
system, let us use it as a model. There
are four essential parts in this type: (1)
a pump to maintain pressure in the fuel
lines to the cylinders, (2) a valve to
supply fuel in the proper ratio to the air
flow, (3) a system to control the fuel
flow by working off the intake air vacuum,
and (4) the atomizers or nozzles at the
cylinders.
An ordinary fuel pump is employed to
deliver the fuel from the storage tank to
the injection pump. During this process
it is necessary to filter the fuel to prevent
any impurities from later clogging the
delicate nozzles. Receiving this filtered
fuel at low pressures, the injection pump
in turn delivers it at high pressures,
which sometimes will reach as high as
300 pounds per square inch. An im-
portant point to note is that the injection
pump always ejects an excess of fuel as
the amount that reaches the cylinders is
regulated by the next component of the
system.
Metering of Fuel Important
The method by which the flow of fuel
is regulated is perhaps the most delicate
portion of the system. The valve which
suplies the fuel in the proper ratio to
the air flow is regulated by a vacuum
control system. In all injection systems,
the throttle directly controls the flow of
air. The fuel valve is connected to a
diaphragm which is in turn connected
by a small pipe to the intake manifold.
The amount of pressure in this pipe indi-
cates how much air is being fed to the
cylinders. For instance, a relatively high
pressure (or minimum vacuum) would
indicate a lot of air and an open throttle.
The valve itself acts as a two way faucet,
for it controls both the amount of fuel
being delivered to the cylinders and the
amount of excess fuel being returned to
the pump reservoir.
As was stated earlier, most automobile
engines are built so that the fuel is in-
jected just ahead of the intake valves.
The fuel enters the cylinder with the air
from the intake manifold. The vaporiz-
ing of the fuel and the passage of air
both have a cooling effect on the nozzles.
Therefore, is is not necessary to build
these nozzles to withstand the high heat
and pressure of the combustion chamber.
However, it is obvious that in this type
of system the fuel may enter the com-
bustion chamber only when the intake
valve is open. This works well up to
engine speeds of about 5,000 r.p.m.
Above this speed, however, the intake
valve is open so briefly that a full charge
of fuel cannot be delivered. In this type
of situation, cylinder injection becomes
favorable. This type of design is used
quite frequently in European cars, which
usually have higher engine speeds than
the American cars.
Other Necessary Controls
Of course, extra control measures must
be included for conditions other than the
normal road-load. During the starting
operation, a lever operates the valve so
that the amount of excess fuel returning
to the pump reservoir is reduced and the
amount flowing to the cylinders is in-
creased. As the engine warms up, a bi-
metal spring used in conjunction with
an electric heating coil operates the valve
in such a way as to "lean out" the en-
riched mixture. During coasting and
idling, when the throttle is closed, aux-
iliary air is pumped directly to each
nozzle. Otherwise the increased engine
vacuum produced under these conditions
would cause fuel to be drawn into the
cylinders without sufficient air to burn it.
This of course would cause the engine
to die. At the same time, a ball valve
operates in such a way as to prevent the
injection pump from building up any
pressure in the fuel lines. We see then,
that during coasting and idling periods,
the nozzle itself is converted into a small,
temporary carburetor.
The pulse flow or timed system is
basically the same as the continuous flow
system described. The chief difference is
that in the timed system the injection
pump is designed so that fuel is delivered
from the nozzle only when the intake
valve is open. This leads, however, to
a slightly more complicated system, with

COMPACTNESS
These compact, miracle devices are making the
conventional vacuum tube obsolete.
by BRYAN WHIPPLE, '61E
Transistors—we've all heard of them
for years, but how many know ex-
actly what has been done with these little
gadgets? How deep are the inroads they
have made on vacuum tubes? What of
their future? And exactly how do they
work, anyway?
Ten years and more have elapsed since
the birth of the transistor in Bell Labora-
tories, as the result of research in solid-
state physics by Bell scientists Bardeen,
Brattain, and Shockley. Unlike many oth-
er newly-discovered phenomena, the po-
tentialities of this device were realized
almost at once. No sooner had the prin-
ciple of solid-state amplification been
devised, than the first crude transistors
were being hand-made, and passed out
to engineers, with orders to find uses for
them.
Advantages Many
Uses were found, indeed! Perhaps a
brief look at the advantages of the trans-
istor over the vacuum tube will serve to
demonstrate the inevitability of this.
Primarily, small size is an advantage
of the transistor. While some tubes are
smaller than some transistors, units cap-
able of doing the same job (say, oscil-
lating at low power) may have volume
ratios on the order of 50 to one. Along
with the saving in bulk directly due to
the transistor, huge additional weight and
space savings are realized from the use
of miniature components in the asso-
ciated circuits. This is possible because
of the second major advantage of the
transistor over its predecessor. Vacuum
tubes require a hot cathode to evolve
electrons. Semiconductor devices do not.
The elimination of the heating elec-
trode does away with a major part of
the ventilation problem, as well as per-
mitting a power saving of from l/2 to 5
watts over typical tubes. Power saving is
not so important in equipment to be
operated from power lines (usually) but
in portable (for instance,) space equip-
ment, it is vital.
Additional power savings from tran-
sistorizing are due to the lower anode
potential required—typically one-tenth
that of vacuum tubes, often a one-hun-
dredth. These low voltages, and the low
currents normally associated with them,

permit the use of extremely small com-
ponents—transformers and capacitors in
particular.
The service life of a transistor is an-
other of its many advantages. Originally,
an average transistor was good for about
85,000 hours. Failures were erratic, due
to imperfections in manufacture rather
than in physical consumption or wear-
ing out. Recent refinements in manu-
facturing have extended the socket-hours
per failure figure to 1,000,000, this in
comparison with 2000 hours for the aver-
age vacuum tube in critical television cir-
cuits. Of course, the theoretical life of a
transistor is nearly infinite, and when
failures do occur they are unpredictable
and for various reasons, usually asso-
ciated with techniques of manufacture.
The quality and characteristics of even
factory-fresh transistors fluctuate.
Mechanically, the transistor is simple
and rugged. Encased completely in plastic
or like material, it is unaffected by vibra-
tion that would make a tube microphic
(generate audio signals due to tuning-
fork like vibrations of its internal ele-
ments), or shocks that might crack its
delicate glass envelope.
Some Disadvantages
Transistors also have certain disad-
vantages which should be aired before
discussing their uses, lest one wonder
why tubes are still used at all. One factor
which has restricted the use of transistors
—more so previously than recently—is
the relatively low cutoff frequency, above
which the transistor refused to function.
Transistors were at first primarily audio-
frequency devices, and only slowly pushed
their way into the radio-frequency spec-
trum. In the last several years units satis-
factory for broadcast-band equipment
became generally available, and now the
upper limit is high enough that all-tran-
sistor television sets can be built—except,
of course, for the picture rube.
Cost is another reason for the restricted
use of transistors in non-critical appli-
cations. For a time after their release to
the general market, it seemed that tran-
sistor price quotations in radio-parts
catalogs were cut in half every year. The
lowest-priced units are now quite com-
petitive pricewise with tubes, but tran-
sistors for special applications remain
more costly. Yet lower transistor prices
seem inevitable as the technology ad-
vances.
Applications of transistors to quality
audio amplifiers have been limited be-
cause of an inherent noise-generating
property of the device. Transistor audio
amplifiers have a faint "Wind-in-the-
trees"' hissing which annoys purists.
This may be partially overcome by use
of special circuitry, and by careful selec-
tion of transistors.
Because excessive heat destroys semi-
conductor devices, transistors did not at
first appear to be capable of serving
power-handling applications. Most types
cannot handle full power at ambient
temperatures above 25°C and must be
de-rated for safe operation. Some of the
latest types will handle 50 watts or oper-
ate at up to 100°C.
The variation in characteristics of new
transistors of the same type that we have
already mentioned is a strike against
them from the start, insofar as use in
mass-produced devices are concerned. If
transistors have to be selected by trial
and error, or circuit values adjusted to
available units, the manufacturers of such
devices will stick to tubes, where any
unit will replace any other, with perhaps
a small adjustment in alignment.
First Uses
Telephone handsets with amplifiers
built in for the hard-of-hearing were the
first use to which Bell put its new de-
vice. Hearing-aids proper were soon
being manufactured almost exclusively
with transistors. Next transistor target
was the computer field, where the sav-
ings in heat generation, size, and power
consumption resulting from their substi-
tution were a true godsend to that indus-
try and all potential computer users.
Desk-top machines could then serve in
place of devices requiring large air-
conditioned rooms.
The military uses of transistors re-
ceived high priority in the early days,
making civilian supplies scarce, and
various space and defense projects still
use a good chunk of our production.

batteries would be much more costly in
relation to the amount of information
received, provided that they could even
be gotten aloft without transistorized
guidance systems. Even very small artill-
ery projectiles may contain transistor
guidance and detonation controls.
Recently, portable radio production
has become an exclusive dominion of the
transistor, while many new cars sport
tubeless auto radios. There are now some
all-transistor home radio sets on the
market, and a battery-operated all tran-
sistor TV has been demonstrated.
Of course, glass cathode-ray picture
tubes will have to be used in "all tran-
sistor" televisions when (and if) they
appear on the market. However, Hugo
Gernsback, the far-seeing editor of
Radio-Electronics magazine, suggests
that it may be possible to devise a flat
semiconductor device to replace even this
use of vacuum tubes!
About 30 U. S. manufacturers now
produce transistors of over 500 official
types and 400 additional types not
Electronic Industries Association regis-
tered. Since 1948 transistor sales have
increased in geometric proportion from
less than a million units to an estimated
120 million units in 1959, and the same
rate of increase in sales may continue
for another decade, according to an esti-
mate made by a large transistor manu-
facturer.
The increase in the dollar volume of
sales presents a more gentle curve, due
to the many price reductions. The dollar
volume of transistor sales in 1958 was
about one-third that of receiving tubes.
Extrapolations of sales trend curves with
estimated inflections for predicted trend
changes show transistor dollar sales vol-
ume passing that for tubes by 1964. By
1966 transistor sales may reach one-half
billion dollars.
A breakdown of the market in the
NED A Journal (National Electrical Dis-
tributors' Association) shows a fairly
consistent year-to year third—each di-
vision of transistor sales between com-
mercial-industrial, home entertainment,
and military uses. The percentage of the
market consumed by domestic uses seems
to be falling while the percent of tran-
sistors employed in military applications
appears to be rising.
How It Works!
We will attempt to explain briefly the
operation of a transistor. The adequacy
of our description will depend on the
reader's familiarity with conventional
electronic circuits, especially vacuum
tubes. Transistors, particularly the widely-
used junction type, are analogous to tubes
in function and circuitry, if not in mode
of operation.
The junction transistor is a three-
terminal device, with each lead connected
to a tiny wafer of germanium (or other
semiconductor). These wafers are ar-
ranged like a sandwich. The two exter-
nal, or "bread" layers are of one type,
while the "meat" layer is another type
of semiconductor—the same metal, but
with different impurities. Germanium,
which has four valence electrons, are
added and electron deficiency ("holes")
results. Two such elements are gallium

and indium. This product is called
P-type (for positive) germanium. The
other type, N-type (negative) is made
by alloying the germanium with ele-
ments of five valence electrons such as
arsenic and antimony. Transistors may be
arranged NPN or PNP—either electron-
deficient or excess-electron type german-
ium may be used as "bread," so long
as the "meat" is different.
Let us discuss the operation of an
NPN transistor. The only reason for
choosing this type for discussion pur-
poses is that the polarity of the applied
voltages follows the tube analog more
closely. A PNP works the same way,
but the applied voltages are of opposite
polarity.
The P wafer in the center is known
as the base, and is analogous to the grid
of a vacuum tube. One of the N wafers,
the emitter, corresponds to the plate.
The other corresponds to the grid.
Just as vacuum tubes may be connected
in grounded cathode, plate, or grid cir-
cuits, transistors may be connected in
common emitter, collector, or base cir-
cuits. The circuit chosen depends on the
imput and output impedances desired.
If we choose the frequently-encountered
common-base circuit and consider its
function as a simple audio amplifier, it
is connected as follows: input across
emitter and base; output across collector
and base, with a voltage source in series
with the output load, positive to the
collector side and negative toward the
base. This voltage source may be quite
small and is the only power supply need-
ed for the basic circuit. Indeed, the
transistor will operate as an oscillator on
the power generated by a flea on a tread-
mill (assuming a suitable generator) if
the flea makes one large jump per min-
ute!
Acts As Amplifier
When a signal voltage is applied
across the input, whose impedance will
be on the order of 60 ohms, the emitter
N-layer injects electrons into the P-layer
(electron deficient) across the junction
area. (Both junctions act as rectifiers—
the resistance to the flow of electrons
from N to P is far less than the resistance
to flow from P to N.) This causes the
P-layer to become less effective in pre-
venting the reverse current flow in the
output circuit, which contains a voltage
source trying to push current through the
second junction the hard way. This tend-
ency of the second to allow a wrong-way
flow is proportional to the extent to which
the signal crossing the input junction
changes the characteristics of the P-layer
from P to N. This in turn depends on
the input level. Hence, the output cir-
cuit current is proportional, or nearly so,
to that of the input. When the output
current is larger, the transistor is func-
tioning as an amplifier.
As in the case of the vacuum-tube
amplifier, a small input is used to regu-
late a battery-supplied current of greater
strength. Since the waveform of the in-
put is reproduced in the output, we say
that the input was amplified.
As with tubes, transistor uses are not
limited to amplification. They serve as
oscillators as well, and make excellent
electronic switches or relays (which is
a form of amplification). Tetrode tran-
sistors with four layers are being tested.
Semiconductors are being put to other
uses related to transistor technology. A

Here's how PPG research put more FUN in boating
Take your pick—water skiing, skin diving, or just
skimming along the surface. Afloat, boats mean fun.
But there's a big difference ashore. Some boats de-
mand wearisome hours of work—caulking, repaint-
ing, replanking. And here's where PPG* research
comes in. Thanks to hulls made from PPG Selec-
tron® and Fiber Glass, boat owners never have to
worry about upkeep and cosdy repairs. PPG Fiber
Glass hulls can't peel, can't rot or corrode. And what
a beating their one-piece construction can take!
There are no seams. No nails. No screws. No rivets
to rust or loosen. There's new styling freedom, too.
Boats of PPG Fiber Glass can take any shape, yet
they're strong, light and durable.
Fiber Glass and Selectron polyester resins are just
two of a long roster of products developed from the
many facets of PPG's research. Every day, the
scientists and engineers at PPG work toward de-
veloping new products and new applications for
established products to benefit our living in count-
less ways. Right now, long range research is being
directed toward finding new uses for Selectron res-
ins and Fiber Glass, toward screening and improv-
ing original ideas and molding them into practical
applications. The possibilities are endless.

rr-ihe largest glass telescope mirror
I blank made since completion 25
years ago of the 200-inch disk for the
Hale Observatory has been cast by Corn-
ing Glass Works.
Designed as the giant reflective piece
for a new national observatory, the disk
is 84 inches in diameter and weighs over
3500 pounds. It is 13 inches thick and
has a center hole 26 inches in diameter.
Melted down at temperatures reaching
approximately 2300 degrees Fahrenheit,
the molten blank has been transferred
from the furnace to a specially-built an-
nealing kiln for scientific cooling which
will continue for seven months. The
regulated cool-down is necessary to elimi-
nate internal stress in the glass.
The disk was formed by a sagging
process in which separate chunks of glass
are placed on the mold and melted to
shape. It is the largest piece of glass
ever produced by this method. The 200-
inch disk, world's largest, was cast by
ladling molten glass into the mold.
The new mirror is being made for an
observatory under construction atop Kitt
Peak, 40 miles southwest of Tucson, Ariz.
The observatory will be operated by The
Association of Universities for Research

pants include the universities of Cali-
fornia, Chicago, Michigan and Wiscon-
sin, and Harvard, Indiana, Ohio State
and Yale universities.
Nine separate pieces of glass were
melted down to form the big blank. The
largest piece weighed 2,796 pounds.
Glass used is a hard, low expansion
borosilicate composition selected because
of its mechanical strength and resistance
to temperature change. The mirror must
retain its shape to prevent distortion of
images.
Like the 200-inch disk, the new blank
is of ribbed construction on the back face.
It is the fisrt large-sized ribbed disk made
by sagging. The honeycombed pattern
was engineered to reduce weight while
retaining necessary strength and rigidity.
The pattern was formed by use of
ceramic cores, bolted and cemented to
the floor of the mold.
With completion of the annealing
cycle, the disk will be crated and shipped
to Tucson where it will be ground and
polished before being hauled to the ob-
servatory site, a 6,875 foot mountain
peak.
The finished mirror will serve as the
primary reflective piece in the larger of
two telescopes being built for astro-
nomical research. The second telescope
is 36 inches in size.
The project is being sponsored by the
National Science Foundation. Along
with the National Radio Astronomy Ob-
servatory at Green Bank, W. Va., the
Arizona observatory will be the first in
the U.S. to be constructed with federal
funds for use of all qualified astronomers.

Bad-weather landings are made safer by the use of Instrument Landing Systems,
which is aptly illustrated by the plane shown here. Unable to land by sight, the
pilot will be safely guided to his landing by this system.
path pointer is centered. If he should
happen to get below this pre-determined
glide path, the needle will point up—
the direction he should fly to reach the
center of the glide path.
Although these two basic instruments
are sufficient to make a bad weather land-
ing, others have been added to the sys-
tem to make the landings easier. Radio
transmitters located along the landing
path throw radio signals vertically so the
pilot will pass through them and be able
to tell how far he is from the runway.
The outer marker (OM) is about 3^2 t0
seven miles from the end of the runway
and the middle marker (MM) lies be-
tween 0.8 and four miles from the run-
way. Some Air Force bases have an inner
marker (IM) 250 feet from the runway
to give the pilot an exact idea of where
he is.
All ILS installations have a certain
pre-determined minimum, usually when
the clouds are below 100 or 200 feet
above the runway. In case of an emer-
gency, the pilot could continue to de-
scend and probably make a good landing.
An advantage of this system is that the
transmitters are automatic and do not
need constant supervision, thus making
it fairly inexpensive. This is seen by the
fact that many airports have installed ILS
systems. One serious disadvantage is that
the pilot has to constantly watch the ILS
indicators, thus taking him from the
important task of watching other instru-
ments and flying the plane. Lately, auto-
matic pilots have been developed that
automatically receive the ILS signals and
keep the plane on the landing path.
Relatively few planes are equipped with
this device.
Ground Control Approach
The Ground Control Approach (GCA)
system eliminates the need for the pilot
to constantly monitor the landing instru-
ments by having a man on the ground
watch a radar set to determine exactly
where the plane is. For this purpose, two
radar sets are used.
The long range radar set keeps track
of the airplanes within 30 miles of the
airport and up to 4,000 feet high. While
the planes are waiting their turn to land,
they appear on this radar.
Once the plane has been cleared to
land, it is picked up on the short range
(10 miles) radarscope by the approach
controller. The controller is in direct
contact with the pilot by radio and orders
him to make certain maneuvers in order
to establish positive identity. Once prop-
erly identified, the pilot is told to fly a
certain course so that he will intercept the
glide path. The controller then gives the
pilot the course to fly and the rate of
descent so he can reach the touchdown
point on the runway. While the pilot is
trying to keep on course and descend at
the proper rate, the controller talks to
him constantly advising him of his posi-
tion and where to fly in case he drifts
off course.
All GCA systems have pre-determined
minimums similar to those used by ILS.
In an emergency the pilot can fly under
them and land in zero visibility without
damaging his aircraft. Most of the time,
however, the clouds are above the mini-
mums and the pilot can make visual con-
tact with the runway and take over con-
trol of the plane.
As mentioned previously, the GCA
system has the great advantage of leav-
ing the pilot free to make corrections
without making him determine what cor-
rections to make. In this way he has
more free time to watch other instru-
ments and make his pre-landing check
of engine(s) wheels, and other equip-
ment. The primary disadvantage is the
cost of having three ground controllers
on duty constantly. However, many mili-
tary bases use the GCA system.
It is regrettable that these two land-
ing systems are taken for granted too
much, since modern air passengers have
little idea how flying would be without
them. To get an idea, though, place a
long plank of wood from the top of a
ten story building to the ground and try
to walk down it in complete darkness
and rain. This should give you a fair
idea how landing would be without these
two bad weather landing systems!

IBM Engineer Richard R. Booth
explores electronic frontiers
to develop new, faster and
larger storage devices
for tomorrow's computers.

Computing time cut from six months to one day
"My job is to design and develop new, high-speed
storage devices for a powerful new computer that
will perform, in one day, operations requiring six
months on present equipment," said Dick Booth
as he began a typical day recently. A product de-
velopment engineer at the IBM Laboratories in
Poughkeepsie, N. Y., he started his morning with a
conference on a product of great interest to him: a
magnetic core storage device with a nondestructive
read-out feature. For an hour, he discussed with
circuit design engineers the logical devices needed
for the register—such as magnetic core drivers and
sense amplifiers. Should such devices not be avail-
able, the group wou Id work on designs for new ones.
Dick Booth next met with members of the Mag-
netic Materials Group to establish specifications for
the magnetic core memory elements to be used in
the register. He also discussed with the group the
development of equipment to test the memory
elements. "This magnetic core register is based on
an original idea of mine," he explained. "When you
have a worthwhile idea, you will be given a free
hand in proving it out, backed by IBM's resources
— plus the assistance of skilled specialists."

Increasing responsibility
At 10:30, Dick Booth reviewed the status of the
entire project with the two engineers, two tech-
nicians, and one logic designer who make up his
team. "My present position is staff engineer," he
explained. "It's the second promotion I've had
since I joined IBM three years ago with a B.S.E.E.
degree from the University of Illinois. I know that
there are plenty of other opportunities to move
ahead. Furthermore, parallel advancement oppor-
tunities exist for engineers in either engineering
development or engineering management."
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Preparing for the future
In the afternoon, Dick Booth went to the 704 Com-
puting Center to supervise some complex preci-
sion computations. "You see how quickly the 704
arrives at the answers," he said. "The computer
being developed is expected to multiply more than
500,000 fourteen-digit numbers a second and add
them at the rate of one million a second. The com-
puter may be used for design computations for
reactors, as well as calculations of satellite be-
havior. Of course it should have hundreds of other
applications."
At 3:30 P.M., Dick Booth attended a weekly class
on Theoretical Physics that lasted until 5:00. After-
ward, he commented, "You know, IBM offers
excellent educational opportunities both in gen-
eral education and for advanced degrees. One of
the engineers in my group has just received his
Master's degree from Syracuse University, after
completing a postgraduate program given right
here at the IBM Laboratory."

A chance to contribute
As he was leaving for the evening, he said, "Yes,
I'd recommend an IBM career to any college gradu-
ate who wants to exercise his creative ability. IBM
will appreciate his talent and he'll have the oppor-
tunity to work with specialists who are tops in
their fields. I doubt that he'd be able to find a
more sympathetic and stimulating atmosphere.
Furthermore, he'll have the added incentive of con-
tributing to vitally important projects . .. projects
that will take him to the frontiers of knowledge in
computer electronics."

When a boy asks
"WHY?"
...anything can happen!
This scene can be duplicated thouaands of times throughout the country.
And aa long aa it goea on, America can be sure of continued progress.
Here Bob Hansen (left) and two friends explore the mechanical wonders
of an engine (1933 model). The two other boys are Tony Riccardi (cen-
ter) and Bill Hess. They are all students at Niles Township High School,
Skokie, Illinois.
Ever since Bob Hansen was old enough to
hold a wrench, he has been tinkering with
machines. Next year his repair shop on his
driveway at home will disappear because
Bob, an honor student, is going to college to
study engineering.

Th« efficiency ml goiolinc and lubricant* is improved constantly in Standard
Oil's huge automotive laboratory in Whiting, Indiana. Here fuels are
designed, too, for automobiles that will not be on the street until five
years from now. Robert W. Boydston, above, is working on a "fuels of
the future"
Bob is one of thousands of American boys
with a restless curiosity about things
mechanical. What makes a clock tick? What
makes a bicycle brake hold? What makes a
car run? From such curiosity comes the
mechanical progress that has helped to make
America great.
In Standard Oil's big
automotive laboratory in
the research center at
Whiting, Indiana, engi-
neers are going through a
similar process every day
—asking questions and
rinding answers. How do
fuel additives affect com-
bustion? How do they
affect engine deposits?
How do burning rates
differ?
And the questions con-
tinue outdoors, too. In all
kinds of weather—hot,
cold, wet, dry, low barom-
eter, high barometer
— different blends of
gasoline are tried to see what happens under
what conditions. Fuels are designed in the
laboratories for experimental engines that
won't appear in an automobile for five years.
Standard Oil products are under constant
improvement to give the finest performance
possible. You get years-ahead quality with
Standard Oil products—and at a reasonable
cost.
Where does progress start? Does it start
on the private driveway of a boy's home or
in a huge research laboratory? Progress
starts whenever someone asks "Why?" and
sets out to find an answer.
What makes a company a good ciliz.n?
Perhaps even more than an individual, a
company must have a healthy respect for
the future. Many companies, like Standard
Oil, have large families—tens of thousands
of people who depend on Standard for their
livelihood. Progress through research is one
way of protecting the future of both employ-
ees and investors and of helping to i
economic stability for the
which they live and work.

North Campus, one of the most important additions to
the University since its founding, is intended to be a train-
ing center primarily for engineering in all its phases. It has
some of the most modern, up-to-date buildings, equipment,
and other facilities such as large parking areas with well
planned access to the various units. The large area, with
provisions for future expansion and improvement, will make
this training center one of the greatest of its type, now or
in the forseeable future. The research facilities provided by
industry will enable students to gain experience which can
be obtained at few other institutions. On example is the
Ford Nuclear Reactor built with funds provided by the
Ford Motor Company.
At present, North Campus consists of the Aeronautical
Engineering Laboratory, Automotive Engineering Labora-
tory, Library Stacks, Mortimer E. Cooley Memorial Labo-
ratory, Printing Building, Phoenix Memorial Laboratory, and
Northwood Apartments for married students. Plans are
under way for a Materials, Metallurgy, and Structures Lab-
oratory; Highway Laboratory; nd Sanitary Engineering Lab-
oratory, as well as additional classrooms. The College of
Engineering hopes to make a complete transfer of all func-
tions to North Campus within a few years. The following
photographs indicate that the dream of the Engineering
College is at last becoming a reality.

The equipment you will design most
probably will have to stand up
against one or more of these 6 differ-
ent forms of corrosive attack:
1. General tarnishing or rusting with
occasional perforations in highly af-
fected areas.
2. Highly localized attack by pitting.
3. Cracking induced by a combination
of stress and corrosion.
4. Corrosion confined to crevices, under
gaskets, or washers, or in sockets.
5. Corrosion of one of an alloy's con-
stituents leaving a weak residue.
6. Corrosion near the junction of two
different metals.
HOW CORROSION OCCURS
The basic cause of corrosion is the
instability of metals in their refined
state. Metals tend to revert to their
natural states through the processes
of corrosion. For example, when you
analyze rust, you will find it is iron
oxide. When you analyze natural iron
ore, you find it, too, is iron oxide.
In all of the six forms of corrosion
mentioned above, corrosion has the
same basic mechanism. It's similar
to the electrochemical action in a dry
cell.
The electrolyte in the dry cell cor-
responds to the corrosive media,
which may be anything from the
moisture in the air to the strongest
alkali or acid.
The plates of the battery correspond
to the metal involved in corrosion.
A potential difference between
these metals or different areas on the
same metal causes electricity to flow
between them through the electro-
lyte and a metallic bridge or contact
that completes the circuit.
At the anode, a destructive altera-
tion or eating away of metal occurs
when the positively charged atoms
of metal detach from the solid sur-
face and enter the solution as ions.
The corresponding negative
charges, in the form of electrons,
travel through the metal, through
the metallic bridge, to the cathode.
Briefly then, for corrosion to occur,
there must first be a difference in
potential between the metals or areas
on the same piece of metal so that
electricity will flow between them.
Next, a release of electrons at the
anode and a formation of metal ions
through disintegration of metal at
the anode. At the cathode, there must
be a simultaneous acceptance of elec-
trons. Action at the anode cannot go
on alone, nor can action at thecathode.
CONTROLLING CORROSION
When corrosion occurs because of
the differences in electrical potential
of dissimilar metals, it is known as
galvanic action. Differences in poten-
tial from point to point on a single
metal surface causes corrosion known
as local action.
When you plan against galvanic
corrosion it is essential to know
which metal in the couple will suffer
accelerated corrosion . . . will act as
the anode in the corrosion reaction.
The galvanic series table shown
below can supply this information.
In any couple, the metal near the top
of this series will be the anode and
suffer accelerated corrosion in a gal-
vanic couple. The one nearer the bot-
tom will be the cathode and remain
free from attack or may corrode at a
much slower rate.

HOW TO USE THE CHART
Notice how the metals are grouped
in the galvanic series table. Any
metal in one group can be safely used
with any other metal in the same
group. However, when you start mix-
ing metals from different groups,
you may run into serious galvanic
corrosion of the metal higher on the
list. And the further apart these
metals are listed, the worse this cor-
rosion may be.
But, if you have to mix metals, pay
particular attention to the electrical
contact between them. Eliminate any
metallic bridges or contacts of metal
to metal that will permit the flow of
electrons through them. You can do
this by separating the metals physi-
cally, or by using insulation or pro-
tective coatings. Another factor is
the relative areas of the metals in
contact with each other. Parts hav-
ing the smaller area should be of a
metal with a lower listing on the
galvanic series table than the metal
used for the larger area.
When you plan against local action,
keep in mind that the corrosion proc-
ess is similar to galvanic action . . .
a movement of electrons from one
point on the metal to another. Natu-
rally, the easiest way to avoid local
action is to use a metal with little or
no impurity ... or an alloy with con-
stituents that are listed closely on
the galvanic series table. Local ac-
tion on other metals, however, can
be controlled by stopping any flow of
electrons . . . such as with protective
coatings. Environment, too, is a fac-
tor for consideration.

JENKINS VALVES control
important service lines
Designed to be the most modem glass container plant in the world,
covering 619,000 square feet and highly automated, this new Owens-
Illinois plant can produce millions of glass containers annually.
In the glass manufacturing operations trouble-free service piping
lines are an essential. Cooling operations require a flow of recirculated
water equal to 2-million gallons per day. The furnaces consume about
3-million cubic feet of natural gas per day.
The fact that Jenkins Valves, in large numbers, are used to control
water, gas, steam, compressed air and air conditioning lines in this new
plant will not surprise most experienced architects, engineers and con-
tractors. For nearly a century, "JENKINS" has been a common specifi-
cation to assure maximum reliability.
It will pay you to have this important assurance when you specify or

SPOTLIGHTS
PROGRESS
Compiled by MURRAY PATTERSON, '60E
In these fast moving days when start-
ling news of satellites and missiles seem
commonplace, ordinary progress in indus-
try and science is pushed into the back-
ground. The TECHNIC is attempting
to point out some of the more interesting
advancements that have recently been
made.
The news this month includes the re-
vealing of a "hot-cold-light" panel which
controls the temperature as well as the
color and intensity in a room, an interest-
ing application of a computer, the prog-
ress of the design and construction of a
nuclear merchant ship, and an amazing
robot which responds to sound.
Paint Resists Blistering
A house paint has been developed
which resists blistering under extremely
severe conditions. The new paint is
chemically engineered to allow moisture
vapor to breathe through while shutting
out water penetration coming from the
outside. It is claimed to be 50 per cent
more durable than oil type coatings, dries
to the touch in 30 minutes, is ready for
second coat in an hour, and can be ap-
plied to damp surfaces.
Hot-Cold-Light
A full-scale wall panel that promises
to light tomorrow's home while also heat-
ing or cooling it has been unveiled by
Westinghouse Electric Corporation. The
"hot-cold-light" panel responds to a set
of dials which can change its temperature
from a low of 55 to a high of 120 de-
grees Fahrenheit, and vary the intensity
and color range of the light source.
The versatility of this "hot-cold-light"
panel results from combining into a
single operating unit two of man's latest
technological advances: thermoelectric
heating and cooling, and electrolumin-
escent lighting, according to Chris J. Wit-
ting, Westinghouse vice president and
general manager, consumer products.
"The panel," he said, "opens up entirely
new concepts for modern living."
"Where we now have separate com-
ponents for lighting, heating, and cool-
ing the home," Mr. Witting said, "the
panel integrates them into a single unit
which is at once functional and decor-
ative. The possibilities for interior design
are tremendous. A living room could
be illuminated with a white or golden
light during the day, for example, and
then by converting to soft blue tones the
same room could be transformed into a
totally different mood for evening time.
"For festive occasions the color and
intensity could be bright and cheerful.
For a restful effect, tones could be soft
and subdued. Entire sections of the ceil-
ing could be covered with electrolumin-
escent panels in full or in pattern.
"This achievement, however, is still
very much in the developmental stage,
and Westinghouse has no plans at this
time for introducing such a panel as a
commercial product."
The actual light screen of the demon-
stration panel provides a range of hues
from blue to blue-green to green. Other
color combinations including the entire
spectrum are possible, according to engi-
neers at the Westinghouse lamp division
in Bloomfield, N.J.
Part of the thermoelectric assembly is
superimposed in artistic designs or "mo-
biles" of anodized aluminum in front of
the electroluminescent screen of the panel.
These mobiles serve to heat or cool the
air of a room. The remainder of the
thermoelectric assembly is hidden from
view behind the glowing screen.
Controls for the entire panel consist
of four dials: one to change color com-
binations; a second to vary the light in-
tensity; a third to select either heating
or cooling; and finally a thermostat for
automatic temperature control.
In dimensions, the panel is 6 feet long
and 4 feet high. It glows with a diffused
light which is complimentary to the ap-
pearance of a room.
The thermoelectric effect is accom-
plished without the aid of any moving
parts such as are present in the conven-
tional refrigeration. Thermoelectric re-
frigeration produces cooling in special
solid materials directly from the flow of
an electric current. Heating occurs when
the direction of current is reversed.
Electroluminescent lighting is pro-
duced by exciting a phosphor coating
with an alternating current. This phos-
phor coating is sandwiched in a panel
no thicker than a pane of window glass.

How large an air conditioning unit is
required by a seven-room ranch house,
facing northwest, and shaded by a grove
of oak trees? An electronic computer
developed by engineers of the Westing-
house Electric Corporation will analyze
the facts about this dwelling and in 24
seconds come up with the answers to its
cooling needs.
The answers for other homes as well
can be provided by the Westinghouse
computer which was exhibited for the
first time on January 26 at the Industrial
Heating and Ventilating Show in Phila-
delphia.
"This computer presents a new ap-
proach to an old industry problem—that
of determining and properly specifying
how much air conditioning capacity is
required in a particular house at a par-
ticular location," said Raymond K. Ser-
fass, manager of the Westinghouse air
conditioning division. "Research and de-
velopment work that went into the West-
inghouse computer during the past two
years," Mr. Serfass said, "testifies to our
belief that electronic computation of this
type will play a greater and greater role
in the air conditioning industry."
In ordinary commercial practice, de-
termining and specifying the proper cool-
ing needs by the installer leaves much
to be desired. When a unit is undersized,
insufficient cooling and poor temperature
control may result. When oversized, the
initial cost is excessive, penalizing the
customer. In addition, the unit may run
too infrequently to provide proper
humidity control.
Mr. Serfass explained that "we intend
to use the computer for training pur-
poses so that our salesmen, distributors
and dealers will be better equipped to
determine the air conditioning needs of
our customers. We do not plan to use
it in calculating air conditioning require-
ments for the individual home owner
at the present time, because its develop-
ment has not yet progressed to the stage
where this would be economically feas-
ible."
The principle behind the analog corn-
Air conditioning is no longer hit or miss,
an electronic computer developed by
Westinghouse scientifically analyzes
over fifty factors affecting the cooling
needs of a home and in twenty-four
seconds a tape like that pictured gives
the information indicating the size air
conditioning unit needed.
puter's operation is that voltage repre-
sents temperature, and current is equated
to the flow or transfer of heat. Capacitors
serve to denote the storage of heat
energy; and resistors are comparable to
thermal resistance. Four basic compo-
nents make up the computer: the gen-
erator section, analog section, amplifier
section, and recorder.
In the generator section of the com-
puter, a knob is present to indicate the
effect of the sun's rays upon the house.
In order to provide the computer with
this information, the time of year and the
latitude of the location must be shown.
Another dial is used to set the direction
in which the house faces. A control
for outdoor air temperature is also in-
cluded in the generator section.
In the analog section, factors taken into
consideration include the type of struc-
ture of the house as represented by the
windows, floors, walls, ceilings, and roof.
Other variables accounted for are:
amount of insulation, shading on the
exterior walls, wind velocity, ventilation
loads, average occupancy, heat generating
from cooking meals, etc.
The amplifier section has controls to
set up the exact area in square feet of
walls, floors, ceiling and glass. Here
also is a dial for indicating the desired
indoor temperature.
Once all of these adjustments have
been made the operator selects an air
conditioning unit in terms of cooling ca-
pacity anywhere from 0 to 110,000
Btu's. Then a switch is set for either air-
cooled or water-cooled unit ratings. A
push of a button puts the computer into
operation. In 24 seconds its recorder
feeds out a strip of tape containing a
chart with a record of the actual outdoor
and indoor temperatures for the house
under consideration over a 24-hour pe-
riod. This tape indicates exactly how an
air conditioning unit will perform in
cooling the home in question. And by

a pipe welder, pipe cutter, fifty ton capacity crane, and a mobile manipulator able
to duplicate forty-eight arm and hand functions are being developed for
radioactive research uses.
varying the factors which have been set
on the dials, much valuable information
may be learned.
By turning up the dial which controls
the occupancy of the house, for example,
it can be ascertained what temperature
the air conditioning unit will maintain
while a number of guests are present for
a party. It is also possible to determine
what effects additional insulation would
have upon the cooling requirements of a
home. Such changes which are made in
the dials on the computer are reflected
on the tape from the recorder as it
charts the temperature variations for a
24-hour period.

A wall of bubbles controls the waves

bles are released at regular intervals.
The created turbulence sets wave energy
working against itself. Result is a 50 per
cent reduction in the height of the waves.

vises critical tests, and he introduces the
weapons to the men with whom they
will serve.
Engineers with many specialties share these
experiences. Today, for example, Vought is
at work on important projects involving:
SPACECRAFT AND ASTRONAUTICS
ADVANCED PROPULSION METHODS
ELECTRONICS DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE
ANTISUBMARINE WARFARE
Vought's excellent R&amp;D facilities help the

NEW VOUGHT CRUSADER FOR FLEET NEXT YEAR!
Navy orders fourth version of flexible, economical fighter
For the fourth time in three years, a new Crusader type
is extending the power of the Fleet. Chance Vought's
F8U-2N has been ordered by the Navy for delivery next
year. It will deploy alongside the Navy's swiftest photo-
planes and two first line day fighters — all Crusaders.
The F8U-2N is another step in Crusader growth. Speed
of this newest version has been advanced to near
Mach 2. It will carry the deadliest air-to-air missiles.
It is instrumented and radar-equipped for supersonic
combat in darkness or bad weather.
This will be a new capability for the Fleet. Yet it is
being acquired at low risk and cost. The F8U-2N's basic
design has been proved simple, serviceable and econom-
ical ... compiling an enviable performance record in a
year of foreign duty with two Fleets.
Again, the growth provisions of the Vought Crusader
have provided immediate, low-cost upgrading of the
Fleet's aircraft inventory.

LIFEBLOOD OF INDUSTRY
Ammonia production requires both accurate
control of processing techniques and a proper
choice of materials for the apparatus.
Ammonia has always been such an
essential raw material in industry
that its successful snythetic production
began nearly a half-century ago. Since
then, modifications have been made to
the original process in order to supply
the tremendous demand for the gas from
manufacturing concerns of all sorts. Like-
wise, greater success has been achieved
by choosing better materials for the con-
struction of the process equipment. This
paper will present a brief description of
a typical process in current use for the
production of synthetic ammonia and a
discussion of the selection of materials
for the important pieces of apparatus.
First Production Attempts
By 1900, it had been fully established
that nitrogen and hydrogen would com-

bine directly in the presence of a catalyst
to yield ammonia, but up until that time
no appreciable amount of the compound
had been produced in this way.
In 1901 LeChatelier attempted to pro-
duce ammonia by the high pressure com-
bination of nitrogen and hydrogen over
an electric spark. Unfortunately, a severe
explosion caused by the accidental pres-
ence of some oxygen destroyed his
apparatus, and he gave up further
attempts along this line.
Further work was done on the deter-
mination of accurate ammonia equilib-
rium data by Nernst and Jost in Ger-
many. Haber's attempts to develop an
ammonia synthesis process also contribu-
ted to the knowledge needed for the
later commercial success of this process.
Finally after several years of research,
a suitable catalyst was found that would
give reasonable conversion at about
500 C. This catalyst consisted of iron
promoted with metallic oxides.
The first commercial process appeared
in Germany in 1913. World War I was
a great stimulus to the ammonia indus-
try both in Germany and in the United
States because ammonia is an important
raw material in the production of ex-
plosives. World War II provided a fur-
ther stimulus. Thus in 1941, our govern-
ment instituted an extensive construction

program for new synthetic ammonia
capacity using the technical skills and
personnel of the ammonia producing
companies. Since then the ammonia in-
dustry has continued to grow until now
over 4,100,000 tons of anhydrous am-
monia are produced annually.
During wartime synthetic ammonia
is used chiefly in the manufacture of ex-
plosives. Peaceful applications are mainly
centered in the production of fertilizer,
although it is also used in the textile,
petroleum, synthetic-resin, rubber phar-
maceuticals, and the pulp and paper in-
dustries, as well as in refrigeration, water
purification and metallurgy.
Present Day Processes
Several different processes are now
being used for ammonia synthesis, but
practically all of them are modifications
of the original Haber-Bosch process. The
most important modifications are in the
sources of hydrogen and nitrogen and
conditions of temperature and pressure
for ammonia synthesis. Most processes
in the United States make use of thermal
reforming of natural gas with steam as
a source of hydrogen, and obtain nitro-
gen from the air. Reaction temperatures
range from 400-600 C. Reaction press-
ures fall into two classes; (1) those near
350 atm. and (2) those near 1000 atm.
Major emphasis will be placed on the
low pressure process because it is the pre-
dominant one.
A typical low pressure process for the
production of ammonia is shown in the
flow diagram in Figure 1. Synthesis gas
is first produced from natural gas by the
following steps:
1. The natural gas is heated and
passed over a bauxite catalyst to re-
move sulfur.
2. It is mixed with steam and allowed
to react to produce carbon mon-
oxide and hydrogen in a tubular
reforming furnace containing a
nickel catalyst at temperatures up
to 1700 F. Since the reaction is
endothermic, heat is supplied
through the reactor tube walls.
3. Sufficient air is added to give the
proper nitrogen to hydrogen ratio
in the final gas and additional
natural gas and steam are added.
This mixture is sent to the com-
bustion chamber where two reac-
tions take place to produce carbon
dioxide and hydrogen.
4. The gases leaving the combustion
chamber have a temperature of 2000
F. and are quenched to 800 F. in
the quench chamber.
5. The gases then pass through a
converter where some carbon mon-
oxide reacts with steam to form
carbon dioxide and hydrogen.
6. Practically all of the remaining car-
bon monoxide or carbon dioxide is
absorbed in appropriate absorbing
solutions and the synthesis gas is
then ready for compression before
being sent to the reactor.
The last traces of carbon dioxide react
with a small percentage of ammonia in
the recycle gas necessitating an ammon-
ium carbamate trap. After passing
through this trap the gas is put through
a separator where a small amount of
ammonia is condensed out. Then it
passes to the converter where reaction
takes place at about 300 atm. and 925 F.
Synthesis gas for the high pressure
processes can be made in the same way
as described above for the low pressure

processes. The chief difference between
the two types of processes is the higher
temperatures and pressures used in the
formation of the final product. These
higher temperatures and pressures require
a more careful choice of the materials
of construction for the synthesis con-
verter which will be discussed in the
next section.
Problem of Equipment Materials
Since steel is practically the only ma-
terial available at reasonable cost with
the necessary physical properties required
to withstand the high mechanical stresses
and temperature effects imposed by
ammonia synthesis, it is used in the con-
struction of most of the process equip-
ment. In a few pieces of equipment very
high temperatures make it necessary to
use a fire-brick lining. Hydrogen attack
and nitriding of the steel are the only
serious corrosion problems encountered
in ammonia synthesis.
Several steps are involved in hydrogen
attack. First hydrogen in the atomic state
is adsorbed on the surface of the steel.
It then enters the lattice of the metal,
apparently becoming ionized in the pro-
cess. The protons thus formed gradually
diffuse through the lattice. Over a period
of time they react with the iron carbide
of the steel to form methane which can-
not diffuse away. The methane molecules
collect at the grain boundaries causing
a tremendous pressure which results in
Assuring, blistering and intercrystalline
cracking. The metal is weakened con-
siderably by these fissures and cracks and
also by the loss of carbon in methane
formation.
A distinction should be made between
hydrogen attack and hydrogen embrittle-
ment. Hydrogen embrittlement is differ-
ent from hydrogen attack in that it
apparently does not involve a chemical
reaction, but is a physical embrittlement
caused by the hydrogen itself. It does
not become evident until pressures of
2000 atm. and above are reached and
therefore is not a problem in ammonia
synthesis.
Since carbon is involved in the mech-
anism of hydrogen attack, there are two
obvious methods of trying to prevent it.
One is the use of low carbon steel and
the other is the addition of alloying
elements that form very stable carbides.
A combination of both methods is used.

SUCCESSFUL highway engineers
There's a real need for qualified men in America's
100 billion dollar highway program. It's a big job.
For example, for the new Interstate Highway Sys-
tem alone, 35,000 miles are still to be built.
Choice assignments await engineers at every level.
They will go to the men who prepare for them.
As part of that preparation, you must have basic
material on Asphalt Technology. For if you don't
know Asphalt, you don't know your highways.
Asphalt is the modern paving for today's and
tomorrow's roads. Asphalt surfaces more than
4/5ths of all roads and streets in the country.
We have put together a special student portfolio
to meet that need for information on Asphalt. It
covers the Asphalt story, origin, uses, how it is
specified for paving . . . and much more. It is a

Engineering Materials
A new semiconductor is being prepared by this student. Its eventual use may be in a transistor, a
computer, or some other newly designed piece of equipment. The demand lor new engineering materials
is terrific. It has been estimated that 50 percent of the materials used by engineers in 1970 will be devel-
oped between now and then. Following years will require still greater numbers of additional materials
to satisfy the demands of high speed travel, power generation, communications, and consumer goods.
The Engineering Materials Curriculum of the University of Michigan is designed to train students in
fundamentals so that they may be among those who will be developing and utilizing materials to meet
the more exacting electrical, thermal, mechanical, and radiation requirements of advanced engineering
designs. This curriculum was the first of its kind to be accredited by the Engineers Council for Profes-

a need for reciprocating parts. The con-
tinuous flow system described is essen-
tially the system which was first offered
on the 1957 Chevrolet as an optional
feature. There are, however, wide vari-
ations in the design of injection systems.
Expense At First Prohibitive
If fuel injection can do all it is claimed
to be able to do, why has it been so long
in coming? An answer to this lies in the
cost. Some racing and aircraft engines
have used it before now since in their
case, cost was a minor factor. Carburetors
are relatively simple in comparison to
injection systems. There are no fuel fil-
ters, injection pumps, complicated meter-
ing systems, or atomizers. The automo-
tive engineer has long considered fuel
injection only to rule it out because of
the expense. As long as the carburetor
was simple and cheap, nobody was in-
terested in fuel injection. However,
when the high power V-8 engines ar-
rived on the automotive scene, the old
two barrel carburetor was found to be
inadequate. It was replaced by one with
four barrels and consequently the cost
rose. In some cases two of these four
barrel carburetors were mounted on the
same engine, causing a still greater in-
crease in price. It then became economi-
cally practicable to consider fuel injection
systems for the method of fuel feed in
the conventional automobile engine. Even
after fuel injection was realized to be
practical, there were still problems that
had to be ironed out before it could be
installed on ordinary automobiles. One
of the chief ones was the problem of
priming for cold starts.
Carburetors, however, have not com-
pletely faded into the background. They
are still less expensive than a fuel injec-
tion system and this fact will probably
keep them around for some time to
come. On the other hand, some automo-
bile executives claim that fuel injection
will be as common as automatic drives by
1962. In any event, fuel injection is
certainly a stride forward in the automo-
tive field and offers advantages that may
be available on all cars in just a few
years.

THIS revolving clock sign, the world's largest,
weighs in excess of 77 tons, has numerals 25 ft.
high. And it turns day and night atop the Continental
National Bank in Fort Worth, Texas. To keep this giant
clock turning, the engineers specified two double-row
Timken® tapered roller bearings for the Brewster RSH
18" Rotary Table which turns the clock.
Timken bearings are used because the full-line con-
tact between their rollers and races gives extra load-
carrying capacity. Their tapered construction lets them
take both radial and thrust loads in any combination.
And Timken bearings are geometrically designed and
precision-made to roll true. They practically eliminate
friction.
Timken bearings solve countless problems wherever
wheels and shafts turn. Problems that you may face in
your future job in industry. Our engineers will be

Chromium is the alloying element used
most because it forms a stable carbide
and in addition gives greater corrosion
resistance when it is in solution in the
iron. Nickel, vanadium, and molybdenum
are also beneficial alloying elements.
As the temperature increases, hydro-
gen attack becomes more serious. The
table in Figure 2 gives the maximum
safe temperature for resistance of hydro-
gen attack for several common steels.
Iron and its alloys including stainless
steels are also subject to nitriding. This
is damaging because it makes the metal
brittle, but it is not nearly so serious as
hydrogen attack. The nitride layer which
forms at the surface provides a barrier
to further inward nitrogen diffusion.
This barrier seems to be most effective
in type 347 stainless steel.
Copper, nickel and nickel rich alloys
are not subject to nitriding. Strongly
deoxidized copper is immune to both
nitrogen and hydrogen attack. In fact
it is the most resistant material to con-
ditions of ammonia synthesis yet dis-
covered. It might be expected that
ammonia would attack copper but this
does not happen because the ammonia
formed is in the anhydrous state and
ammonia only corrodes copper in aqueous
solutions. (A copper-ammonium com-
plex is formed in aqueous solutions.)
Unfortunately low creep strength limits
use of copper to heat exchanger tubes
where the pressure is practically equal
on both sides of the tube wall.
Since nitriding cannot be eliminated
in steels, a steel which will not become
heavily nitrided must be chosen when
the temperature and amount of nitrogen
present are high enough to cause in-
significant nitriding.
Essential Parts of Apparatus
From the standpoint of choosing con-
struction materials the most significant
parts of the process are the reformer
furnace, combustion chamber, water gas
converter, and synthesis converter. These
four will be discussed below. The remain-
ing equipment can be constructed of car-
bon steel.
In the reformer furnace natural gas
and steam are passed through reforming
tubes containing a nickel catalyst. Since
the reaction is highly endothermic, the
reforming tubes must be heated from
outside to 1700 F°. To withstand this
high temperature and to resist the attack
of hydrogen formed in the reaction, the
reformer tubes must be made from a
high chrome-nickel stainless steel such
as type 310 (25% Cr, 20% Ni). Type
310 was commonly used in the wartime

plants. Recently, Incoloy, a new coarse
grained alloy containing 0.07% C, 21%
Cr, 34% Ni, and the balance iron was
proposed to replace type 310 because it
permits reforming at higher tempera-
tures.
The shell of the reformer furnace
can be constructed of carbon steel but
it must be lined with fire brick because
of the very high temperatures in the
furnace.
The combustion chamber and the water
gas converter are similar to the reformer
furnace shell in that they can be con-
structed of carbon steel, and they, too,
must be lined with fire brick because of
the high temperatures involved.
In most ammonia synthesis converters
cool incoming gas passes down the
periphery of the shell, then up through
a heat exchanger where it is heated by
outgoing gas before being passed through
tubes in the catalyst bed where the re-
action takes place at about 500 C. Since
the reaction is exothermic the proper
reaction temperature must be maintained
by cooling tubes in the catalyst bed.
The shell of the reactor vessel is made
from high strength carbon steel but a
liner of chromium steel usually is placed
inside the shell to protect it from attack
by hydrogen and nitrogen. Chemical
attack is also minimized by passing cool
incoming gas down the reactor wall and
by insulating the wall from the internals
of the converter so that the wall temper-
ature is considerably below the reaction
temperature.
It has been found that type 501 steel
(4-6% Cr) can be used for construction
of the catalyst cooling and heat exchang-
er tubes for use at temperatures up to
500 C. in the low pressure converters.
Above 500 C. the rate of nitriding in-
creases. At temperatures above 500 C.
type 304 stainless steel (18-20% Cr,
8-11% Ni, 0.08% C, 0.5-2% Mn, bal-
ance Fe) has been suggested because ni-
triding action is slow and embrittlement
does not proceed below the case depth.
In addition austenitic chromium-nickel
types such as 304 have been found to
be the most resistant to nitrogen and
hydrogen attack.
The high pressure converters differ
from the low pressure converters in that
certain critical parts must be made from
a special alloy known as BTG metal
(60% Ni, 12% Cr, 2.57cW, balance
Fe). BTG metal is particularly adapted
to withstanding hydrogen attack at high
temperatures and elevated pressures. Its
yield point remains high at elevated tem-
peratures. In present high pressure
plants it is used only where the combina-
tion of high pressure and temperature is
unavoidable.

rules out the second and fifth integers.
The digital root of a square is always
1, 4, 7, or 9. This rules out the first,
third, and fourth integers. Only the
sixth, with a root of 7, can be a square.
There are 1,578,528,000 ways. In
dealing with the A's, be sure to reckon
the permutations of 3 out of 30, not
merely the combinations. The puzzle
asks, "How many ways to pick out and
arrange," implying that each different
permutation of the same 3 A's among
the 3 positions is to be considered a
different arrangement.
The sum of a Fibonacci Series can be
found by multiplying the sixth term by
11; in this case 80 X 11 = 880.

to verify that the shortest path from B

"obvious" path. Notice that the shortest
path traverses 5 of the 6 walls.

BIG FEET
by WALTER WILLIS, '60E
Once upon a time, as a fairy tale
goes, there was a man with truly
enormous feet. It was not true, however,
that everywhere he went he was met with
ridicule. Far from it—he was the object
of envy in his primitive society for when
he went hunting he trampled down so
much brush that he flushed several mul-
tiples of the game seen by other hunters
and so enjoyed a high protein diet. In-
deed, the signs of his passage were so
pronounced that other hunters would sur-
vey the landscape, shrug and go another
way.
* * *
Engineers, too, must have big feet.
Bigger than the mythical hunter's, for the
signs of the engineer's progress are to be
found in all directions. Everything from
safety pins to satellites have had engi-
neering attention in their design and con-
struction.
The current era finds us at a point
where the activities of mankind have
assumed such proportions that a new
force of nature has appeared on the face
of the earth. It is significant that engi-
neers share in any or all parts of the
conception, planning, and direction of
the tremendous projects of the human
race. This can lead to a different stress
on 'must' and 'have' in saying that engi-
neers must have big feet. The important
part the engineer plays in the physical
aspects of civilization confers upon him
a large measure of influence on the course
of society, whether he seeks it or not.
Concomitant with this influence should
be a sense of responsibility on the part
of the engineer. It is not enough that
he be competent in his field; he should
also consider at all times how his work
will affect the intangibles of civilization,
the things which do not submit to meas-
urement or calibration but which never-
theless constitute so important a part of
what we refer to as Freedom, Home, and
Mother. The fact that a man has become
an engineer is in itself an indication that
he possesses the qualities of mind and
application required for intelligent action.
The fact that he is engaged in a pro-

Walfer Willis
Tau Beta Pi essay winner.
fession which affects human life indicates
that he should possess the moral attitudes
desirable in a leader. When an indi-
vidual combines these qualities of char-
acter and intelligence he is representative
of that portion of the population best
suited to carry the responsibility of direct-
ing the course of human progress.
Thus the engineer owes it to society
to participate in the governmental and
cultural activities of his community to the
same degree that he influences that com-
munity by his work. This is not to say
that every engineer should rush out and
become a politician. Far from it, since
he has another important job to do. But
he should keep himself informed of the
significance of current events and be pre-
pared to take issue with those who seek
to confuse and mislead people less well
equipped to judge the merits of a course
of action. Further, he should consider
the effect of his own actions. If he makes
discoveries which are potentially destruc-
tive to society he should consider the risk
of bad effects against the chances of
benefitting humanity before he decides
whether to conceal or to make public
his new knowledge.
* * *
In the last analysis, the engineer must
get out and mingle, not just with other
engineers, but with all classes of people
and participate in many of the activities
of his community to satisfy both sides of
the coin. On the one hand, when he
challenges the actions or words of an-
other, he must be well enough known to
make himself heard. On the other hand,
he must know his fellow man well so
that his decisions about his own actions
will be based on an accurate knowledge
of what will be best for society as a
whole. To adequately cover all this
ground calls for big feet indeed, but it
can be the most difficult and provocative
challenge the engineer is called upon to
meet.

One of a series
Interview with General Electric's
Hubert W. Gouldthorpe
Manager—Engineering Personnel
Your Salary
Although many surveys show thai salary
is not the prime factor contributing to job
satisfaction, it is of great importance to
students weighing career opportunities.
Here, Mr. Gouldthorpe answers some
questions frequently asked by college
engineering students.
Q. Mr. Gouldthorpe, how do you deter-
mine the starting salaries you offer
graduating engineers?
A. Well, we try to evaluate the
man's potential worth to General
Electric. This depends on his quali-
fications and our need for those
qualifications.
Q. How do you evaluate this potential?
A. We do it on the basis of demon-
strated scholarship and extra-curric-
ular performance, work experience,
and personal qualities as appraised
by interviewers, faculty, and other
references.
Of course, we're not the only com-
pany looking for highly qualified
men. We're alert to competition and
pay competitive salaries to get the
promising engineers we need.
Q. When could I expect my first raise
at General Electric?
A. Our primary training programs
for engineers, the Engineering Pro-
gram, Manufacturing Program, and
Technical Marketing Program, gen-
erally grant raises after you've been
with the Company about a year.
Q. Is it an automatic raise?
A. It's automatic only in the sense
that your salary is reviewed at that
time. Its amount, however, is not
the same for everyone. This depends
first and foremost on how well you
have performed your assignments,
but pay changes do reflect trends in
over-all salary structure brought on
by changes in the cost of living or
other factors.
Q. How much is your benefit program
worth, as an addition to salary?
A. A great deal. Company benefits
can be a surprisingly large part of
employee compensation. We figure
our total benefit program can be
worth as much as 1/6 of your
salary, depending on the extent to
which you participate in the many
programs available at G.E.
Q. Participation in the programs, then,
is voluntary?
A. Oh, yes. The medical and life
insurance plan, pension plan, and
savings and stock bonus plan are all
operated on a mutual contribution
basis, and you're not obligated to
join any of them. But they are such
good values that most of our people
do participate. They're an excellent
way to save and provide personal
and family protection.
Q. After you've been with a company
like G.E. for a few years, who decides
when a raise is given and how much it
will be? How high up does this decision
have to go?
A. We review professional salaries
at least once a year. Under our
philosophy of delegating such re-
sponsibilities, the decision regarding
your raise will be made by one man
—the man you report to; subject to
the approval of only one other man
—his manager.
Q. At present, what salaries do engi-
neers with ten years' experience make?
A. According to a 1956 Survey of
the Engineers Joint Council*, engi-
neers with 10 years in the electrical
machinery manufacturing industry
were earning a median salary of
$8100, with salaries ranging up to
and beyond $15,000. At General
Electric more than two thirds of our
10-year, technical college graduates
are earning above this industry
median. This is because we provide
opportunity for the competent man
to develop rapidly toward the bigger
job that fits his interests and makes
full use of his capabilities. As a
natural consequence, more men have
reached the higher salaried positions
faster, and they are there because of
the high value of their contribution.
I hope this answers the question
you asked, but I want to emphasize
again that the salary you will be
earning depends on the value of
your contribution. The effect of such
considerations as years of service,
industry median salaries, etc., will be
insignificant by comparison. It is
most important for you to pick a job
that will let you make the most of
your capabilities.
Q. Do you have one salary plan for
professional people in engineering and
a different one for those in managerial
work?
A. No, we don't make such a
distinction between these two im-
portant kinds of work. We have an
integrated salary structure which
covers both kinds of jobs, all the way
up to the President's. It assures pay
in accordance with actual individual
contribution, whichever avenue a
man may choose to follow.

Dean
W. J. Emmons

"Sit down, my boy, and tell me all about it."
These words, familiar to many a troubled Michigan En-
gineer, will no longer be heard from behind the door marked,
"W. J. Emmons, Associate Dean," after July 1, the day the
Dean retires from the job he has held for some 15 years.
As Associate Dean of the Engineering College, Walter
Johnson Emmons is the man who meets the students; the
man who has helped scores of students with their academic
and personal problems; and the man who listens to numerous
complaints of engineering students. For occasional students,
who drop in at all hours of the day, he is also a man who can
always find time to stop and just "shoot the breeze" for a
few minutes.
If you happen to be one of these students you know that
Dean Emmons is capable of discussing subjects ranging from
the Turkish Air Force to students' big problems, to highway
construction. He believes that the majority of the students
who come to see him are bothered by the same basic problem
—they are uncertain of their objectives and of the purpose
of their college education. Quoting a number of students as
telling him, "I don't know what I want to do," he claims that
"it is the students obligation to determine his own goals and
to make himself a success, for no professor or dean can do
this for him."
As an example he cites the story of a sophomore engineer
who, in his words, "wasn't worth the shoe leather to kick
him out of school." This individual was on probation when
he left school to serve his time with the Armed Forces; by
the time he came back he was married, had a kid and a dog.
He had a terrific record then, and in fact he's now General
Manager of a General Electric plant. You've got to want what
you're after, as well as have the ability to get it."
"But," he added, "I'm not advocating that these guys
should all be bookworms. Everybody wants them to have a
good time in school. They should go to at least one football
game each year. But they should remember that they're here
to go to school."
"I'm in favor of fraternities, for instance—they give a
fella an opportunity to take on responsibilities, to prove him-
self. But it is an unfortunate fact that a few men devote so
much of their time to their fraternity that they neglect an
even more important part of their education—study."
"I've never tried to tell anyone that their work here at the
university should be easy for them," Dean Emmons remarked.
"This isn't a finishing school. Our selective admissions policy
makes only room for students with excellent potentials and
the competition is inclined to be a bit tough. Some students
can't make it, for anyone of a number of reasons and they
fall by the wayside. Other students discover their goals while
they're at the university, and they make it. These students
somehow provide me with a sense of satisfaction which makes
my job the enjoyable one that it is."
Turning his comments to another area it is obvious that
Dean Emmons has a high opinion of the Engineering College
faculty, as well as the student body. He remarks that, "The
students should meet the faculty. They'll find them much
different than their high school teachers. Whereas the high
school teachers are interested in teaching, the university
faculty members are also actively engaged in their respective
professions. Their research projects and their consulting jobs
give them a feeling of living in a world of applied knowledge,
not just a world of education. If more students would just
make up excuses to go in and meet their instructors, they
would find them to be very interesting people."
Twenty-two years after he first began his Civil Engineering
career at Michigan by squirting tar on our roads for the State
Highway Laboratory, Dean Emmons is bowing out. When
asked what he planned to do after he retires, the dean paused
reflectively for a moment before replying, "After I retire I
intend to make a profession of what has previously been only
a hobby—procrastination."

Tkorstein Veblen... on the place of science
"In creative art. as well as in critical taste, trie faltering
talent of Christendom can at the best follow the lead of
the ancient Creeks and the Chinese. In myth-making,
folklore, and occult symbolism many of the lower bar-
barians have achieved things beyond what the latter-day
priests and poets know how to propose. In political
finesse, as well as in unreasoning, brute loyalty, more
than one of the ancient peoples give evidence of a
capacity to which no modern civilized nation may aspire.

of sober reflection, all these things that distinguish the

barbarian civilizations seem of dubious value... futile
in comparison with the achievements of science. They
dwindle in men's esteem as lime passes. This is the one
secure holding-ground of latter-day conviction, that 'the
increase and diffusion of knowledge among men' is inde-
feasibly right and good. When seen in such perspective
as will clear it of the trivial perplexities of work day life,
this proposition is not questioned within the horizon of
western culture, and no other cultural ideal holds a

STRAIGHT TALK TO ENGINEERS
from Donald W. Douglas, Jr.
President, Douglas Aircraft Company
I've been asked whether non-aeronautical engi-
neers have good prospects for advancement in
the aviation industry.
The answer is yes, definitely! At Douglas many
of our top supervisory people have moved up from
other engineering specialties. The complexity of
modern aircraft and missiles requires the greatest
variety of engineering skills known to industry.
For example, we now have pressing needs for
mechanical, structural, electrical and electronics
engineers in addition to aerodynamicists, physi-
cists and mathematicians. Whatever your back-
ground in the engineering profession may be,
there are prime opportunities in the stimulating
aircraft and missiles field.

How to "see" without looking
At a final inspection station how would you
make sure that enclosed parts were properly
lubricated? Until recently, if you really wanted
to know, you had to remove the housing, dis-
assemble the mechanism—a costly, time-
consuming process—and take a look.
But now Standard Oil research has solved
the problem with a new instrument system
that does away with disassembly. It passes
radiation through the assembly and measures
the amount that gets through. Inspectors can
tell whether or not the proper level of lubricant
is present without looking inside.
This remarkable device is just one of hun-
dreds of ways in which Standard has helped
industry solve problems connected with lubri-
cation. It was developed by a team of Standard
Oil scientists and engineers who saw the need
for a new approach to an old problem.
Such creative thinking is the product of the
atmosphere in which Standard Oil scientists
work. They have the time, the equipment and
the opportunity to contribute to the progress
of their industry and their country. That is
why so many young scientists have chosen to
build satisfying careers with Standard Oil.

Maillart was a bridge-building genius, yet the
public refused to approve his futuristic designs.
Salginatobel Bridge 1929-30
This three hinged arch bridge
leaps across the valley below with
an extraordinary feeling of free-
dom and strength. Only the solid
side walls mar its appearance.
After weeks and months, or even
years, of struggling with a problem
an engineer may finally make an im-
portant decision—to start with the most
basic fundamentals and aim for the
solution, disregarding all preconceived
notions. The result may well be a com-
pletely new and astonishing answer to
the problem. Again and again this has
been the story of many of our great
leaders in science and engineering.
Another Problem
As often is the case, however, this
may bring a problem that makes the
initial technical one look small in com-
parison. The new problem is that his
design or solution may be so advanced
for his day that the reward for his de-
termination to create an original solution
may be lack of commissions, the censure
of colleagues and a general lack of sym-
pathy on the part of the public.
This was the fate of Robert Maillart.
An early twentieth century bridge de-
signer, Maillart is now hailed by archi-
tects, as well as engineers, an one of the
very few real "artists" to emerge from
the engineering profession, but still he
was (and is) practically unknown even
within his own country, Switzerland.
Indeed, officials were so shocked with
his designs that they permitted him to
construct his bridges only in remote and
lonely alpine valleys. Thus they took
advantage of the phenomenal low cost of
his work while not disturbing their own
by BERNARD STOLLMAN, '59E
senses by having to look at his radical
designs.
Maillart was an artist—an engineer
in the real Leonardian sense. His bridges
are alive, bursting with the exhilaration
of freedom and strength. Yet it was
these same qualities which completely
bewildered the public throughout his en-
tire career. Though communities might
have wanted to accept his designs be-
cause of their amazing low cost, few
wanted to risk building anything as
radical as the Tavannes bridge. One
spokesman declared he "wanted none of
those powder-puff bridges." Unwittingly
he was reflecting both the success of
Maillart's designs and the public's own
inability to emerge from a 19th century
way of thinking.
We can best understand the funda-
mental aspects that gave Maillart's bridges
such qualities if we remember, first of all,
that while architectural design is dedi-
cated to the molding of interior space,
bridges express themselves through
structure and materials alone. A bridge
has no interior space and thus it frees
itself from many of the psychological
problems involved in the creation of
something so intangible. Instead a bridge
cuts through space—its essence being in
a controlled movement between two
points. This continuity of movement
requires an abstractness, a quality of
which most bridge designers are un-
aware. Maillart knew what continuity
meant; even his earliest work shows his

attempt to incorporate it in his bridges.
It was a concept which he applied with
vigor to every design he produced.
Actually it is this quality which suprises
and pleases most people who see Mail-
lart's bridges for the first time.
Turning now from the generalities
let us examine in more detail the evolu-
tion of Maillart's ideals and how he
applied them to bridge designs. Little
information is available as to Mail-
lart's personal life and even this scant
amount is relatively unspectacular. Suf-
fice it to say that he was born in 1872
at Berne, Switzerland, received a struc-
tural engineering degree, and worked for
several years with Francois Hennibique,
then the most eminent designer in con-
crete.
Hennebique was aware of the strength
inherent in concrete but he was unable
to take advantage of it. Bridges like his
Ourthe Bridge in Belgium demonstrated
that he was aware of the way in which
concrete lent itself to smooth flowing
structures. Yet it was Maillart who was
convinced that reinforced concrete was a
revolutionary new material, possessing
characteristics quite distinct from any
material in popular use at the time.
Aesthetic Values
Although a Frenchman named Monier
was the first to experiment successfully
with reinforced concrete in slabs and
arches, it was Maillart who first realized
that constructors were ignoring the possi-
bilities of which concrete was capable.
His considerations were aesthetic as well
as structural. He wrote in 1938:
"Reinforced concrete Joes not grow
like wood, it is not rolled like steel and
has no joints as masonry. It is most
easily compared with cast-iron as a mate-
rial cast in forms, and perhaps we can
learn something directly from the slowly
discovered cast-continuity between the
members that serve different functions.
The condition of this beautiful continuity
is the conception of the structure as a
whole. The automobile and aircraft con-
structors have attained this in the highest
degree, while it is an exception for the
reinforced concrete constructors to per-
ceive this. It is not only the feeling for
beauty which makes desirable the con-
ception of the whole primary to that of
Schwandbach Bridge 1933

bines maximum economy, continues the
existing roadway without interruption—
with an extremely striking design.
the single elements. Seeing the structure
as a whole nearly always brings eco-
nomical advantage as well. . . .
"The engineer should then free him-
self from the forms dictated by the tra-
dition of the older building materials,
so that in complete freedom and by con-
ceiving the problem as a whole, it would
be possible to use the material to its
ultimate. Perhaps then we would also
arrive at a new style as in automobile
and aircraft construction, as beautiful,
and in the same way determined by the
nature of the material."
Until Maillart's time the slab had little
or no structural use. Strength in con-
crete was achieved through concrete
beams, columns and piers. Yet, Maillart
found that proper reinforcing enabled
the slab to become an active bearing sur-
face, of sustaining great amounts of
stress.
The Tavannes bridge over the Rhine,
begun in 1905, was Maillart's first at-
tempt to put his newly forming knowl-
edge of his material to test. He produced
a bridge which alarmed authorities to the
extent that he was unable to design an-
other bridge for seven years. The Ta-
vannes bridge was only the beginning of
a life-long struggle to build bridges
which conformed to his ideals.

music, writing and photography.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Maillart's first attempt at an organic
approach to bridge design . . . unfor-
tunately, this plastic creation in con-
crete was destroyed in a landslide
in 1927.
Engineering had begun to emerge as a
separate trade (distinct from architecture
in the 18th century). While architecture
went through periods of classic revival,
and generally refrained from doing any-
thing original, engineers were striving to
create new forms in their bridges.
Throughout most of the 19th century,
bridge builders did far more to seek out
new and exciting structures than did
even the most prominent architects. How-
ever, the end of the 19th and the begin-
ning of the 20th century saw a curious
reversal of positions. Starting with H. H.
Richardson and Louis Sullivan, architec-
ture began to recover from the classic
revival. Engineers, on the other hand,
thought that the problem of bridge de-
sign had been solved permanently with
the perfection of the heavy masonry
bridge. Both the public and bridge de-
signers felt that, since mass was the
factor that enabled a bridge to sustain
loads, the reality of a bridge, the key to
its structure, lay in its mass. This myth
handicapped bridge designers for nearly
half a century.
This was the situation when the
Tavannes bridge was constructed — a
"powder puff bridge"—the direct anti-
thesis of what the public wanted.
By restricting his bridges to remote
valleys and rivers, the authorities suc-
ceeded in eliminating his work from
view. But far from ruining the impact
of Maillart's work, these lonely valleys
enhance them in a way the authorities
had never dreamed possible. The Sal-
ginatobel bridge, for example, leaps with
amazing power and smoothness across its
chasm. Conceived as a whole, it ex-
presses itself as a whole; in a word, it
is natural, as natural as the valley over
which it hovers.
Two Types
In the main, Maillart*s bridges are
either of the stiffened slab-arch type or
of the three hinged arch with integrated
road-slab. Of the slab arch type the
Val Tschiel is the earliest bridge that
can still be seen in its original form.
Constructively it is supported by an
arched rib stiffened by longitudinal
beams, between which are solid supports




in the form of cross walls. The smooth
flowing effect of the structure is ruined
by the massive end walls and the rather
distasteful ornamentation, both of which
rather were the additions of somewhat
ignorant authorities.
The Schwandbach bridge is one of
Maillart's most imposing solutions. Span-
ning a deep ravine, it swings through
an ellipse to enable the trafficway to
continue uninterrupted. The concept of
a whole bridge as a whole unit becomes
a reality in this bridge—a plastic cre-
ation of strength and motion.
In the Wulflingen bridge, the subtle
reverse curve of the deck is typical of
Maillart's artistry. In the only mono-
graph on Maillart's life, Max Bill de-
scribes it as having "the ease and pleasant
naturalness as if it had grown there and
had sought to span the river itself."
In his three-hinged arch bridges Mail-
lart showed a more obvious conscious
development of a single kind of solution.
With the Tavanassa Bridge he commenced
experimentation with a shape that one
critic described as "two enormous skates
joined toe to toe." Reducing the arches
to box sections, he also carved out the
side to reduce the weight and at the
same time to give the bridge an amazing
aesthetic character. The fact that the
bridge still looks "modern" to viewers
of photographs of it (it was destroyed
by a landslide in 1927) is both a tribute
to Maillart's creative sense and evidence
of the slowness with which engineers
have evolved more lithe and plastic
structures.
The box section was also employed
on the Salginatobel bridge but with dif-
ferent results. The success of the bridge
may be attributed both to the extraordi-
nary setting and to the charm of the arch
itself. The design is marred, however,
by the solid walls which were probably
added by the authorities, not by Maillart.
The Rossgraben bridge carried the
solution one step further; the heavy side
walls were removed.
The Thur bridge uses two box sections,
allowing the same shuttering to be used
twice. For the first time, Maillart uses
the pointed arch, rejecting the traditional
one on constructive grounds. However,
the solid side walls again ruin the ap-
pearance of the structure.
The Aarve bridge also employs two
box sections. The structure of the sup-
ports is striking; they have been reduced
to the statically permitted minimum and
yet attain a kind of elegance equaled
perhaps only in the supports of the Thur
bridge.
His Best Not Built
Amazingly, most of Maillart's super-
ior designs were never constructed.
The most striking and very likely the
finest, both technically and artistically,
of these unbuilt bridges was one which
was to cross the Rhone River. Struc-
turally, it consisted of a continuous
girder with built-in slab and cantilevered
sidewalks. As one critic points out, "it
does no credit to the authorities and
their advisors that this bridge was never

Project MICHIGAN
The University's Willow Run Laboratories are
the site of Project MICHIGAN — a multi-million
dollar, top secret research contract. by JAY SKLAR, '60E
Not far from Ann Arbor lies Willow
Run Airport, the only university-
owned commercial airport in America.
To the casual observer, the bleak run-
ways and faded hangars present the
usual picture of a major U. S. airport;
but, air traffic is not the only activity
there. Across the landing field from the
air terminal is a group of low, barrack-
like buildings and hangars. Inside them
engineers, scientists, and technicians are
pushing back the frontiers of knowledge
and technology. This is the site of Wil-
low Run Laboratories.
Willow Run Largest
The University of Michigan maintains,
on main campus, north campus, and at
Willow Run, many separate research
activities in science and engineering; of
these, WRL is the largest, with 750 em-
ployees. The Laboratories carry out a
diversified program of contract research,
in order to make available to govern-
ment and industry the resources of the
University, and to broaden the educa-
tional opportunities for students in sci-
ence and engineering. The largest of
these contracts, known as Project MICH-
IGAN, will form the basis for our study
of this nationally known research center.
To the casual observer the words
"Project MICHIGAN" and "Willow
Run Labs" are somewhat synonymous.
Lest this misconception be furthered by
our concentration on Project MICHI-
GAN we hasten to add that numerous
other projects and studies are being un-
dertaken by WRL. These other studies
are not as large as Project MICHIGAN,
but they are certainly important in their
own right.
For the Michigan engineer, however,
the activities at Willow Run have an
additional significance. Many of the em-
ployees at WRL are U-M graduates
while a large portion of the others have
also studied at Michigan during some
phase of their education. Still others are
pursuing graduate and undergraduate
studies in the University at this time.
It is certainly conceivable that many of
today's undergraduate engineers will seek
future employment there, either while
pursuing graduate studies or as perma-
nent full-time researchers. If so, they
will see some of their former professors
and instructors; many of these partici-
pate in the Project on a part-time basis.
To find out more about Project MICH-
IGAN—and to see what place the
Michigan graduate has at Willow Run
and the place you, the engineer of to-
morrow, might have there—a "trip" to
the labs will be very rewarding. Of
course, the first thing you would notice
as you arrive at WRL is that the nature
of the project requires security guards
and that every visitor is continually ac-
companied by a responsible employee.
Everywhere you would see shopping-type
bags with the bright red lettering "Class-
ified Waste." You are always aware that
the project is important and highly se-
cret. It is most important at Willow
Run, that no details get beyond the ten-
foot fence which surrounds the area.
In 1953, the U. S. Army awarded to
the University of Michigan one of the
largest and broadest contracts—namely,
Project MICHIGAN, ever given to an
educational institution with the mission
of carrying out a research and develop-
ment program for advancing the Army's
long-range combat surveillance capabili-
ties. After six years and many millions
of dollars, this complex problem is not
yet solved, but some major steps have
been taken. At the present time the em-
phasis of the Project is upon basic and
applied research in radar, infrared,
acoustics, seismics, information process-
ing and display, navigation and guidance
for aerial platforms, and systems con-
cepts. Particular attention is given to
all-weather, long-range, high-resolution
sensory and location techniques, and to
the evaluation of systems and equipment
through simulation and by means of
laboratory and field tests. The Project
is sponsored by the U. S. Army Combat
Surveillance Agency of the Signal Corps.
It should be kept in mind that the
major purpose of Project MICHIGAN
is not to develop hardware. The equip-
ment being developed is all experimental
and its primary objective is to test the-
oretical concepts. After the theories have
been proven, the development of equip-
ment is left to other organizations. Typic-
ally, industrial firms are now constructing
experimental models of two Project
MICHIGAN radar systems, under sub-
contract to the University, for delivery
to the Army for test, evaluation, and de-
velopment into field-worthy form.
One Question
Basically, there is one question which
a surveillance system hopes to answer
12
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


He wants to know, "where is the enemy,
and what is he doing?" His dream, so
to speak, is a little black box that he
could carry with him continually. Up-to-
date details of the enemy's whereabouts
and other valuable information about
him would immediately be relayed to
the commander. This may sound like a
pipe dream, but, if Project MICHI-
GAN'S successes continue, this dream
could approach realization.
There are three stages in answering
this question. The first is sensing. By
various means, sensing devices detect
where the enemy is and tell what he is
actually doing. Radar and infrared (or
IR) are two of the more modern meth-
ods.
From an airborne or ground-based in-
stallation, high-frequency pulses are trans-
mitted outward. As these pulses continue
through space, they are reflected by
objects in their path and are returned
to the installation. In addition to the
transmitter, there is a receiver at the in-
stallation which measures the time differ-
ence between transmission and reflection,
and the directions from which the re-
flections return. In this way, the loca-
tions of objects are determined. But,
although this tells where things are loca-
ted, it does not tell exactly what they
are or what they are doing. Project
MICHIGAN is working on advancing
this radar capability. Certainly, this type
of information will be helpful to the
battle commander.
Infrared is a fairly recent method of
military surveillance. All objects, natural
and man-made, give off infrared radia-
tion by virtue of their temperature. All
of these objects can be detected to a
degree by IR sensing devices. The Proj-
ect has a program ranging from basic
research through experimental model
development aimed at capitalizing on
this potential.
Acoustic and seismic equipment is also
being developed for sensing. When a
bomb or large gun goes off, for example,
shock waves are transmitted through the
air and earth. Agan the Project's activi-
ties range from basic research in wave
propagation through development of ex-
perimental models of acoustic and seismic
subsystems.
After the data are collected by the
various sensing methods, the second stage
begins. The data must be compiled into
useable form. Perhaps one sensing unit
will pick up a small bit of information
on enemy movement. This will not tell
the whole story. However, if all avail-
able data were relayed to one central
place, they could be processed and gen-
eral trends in enemy action could be
ascertained.
In recent years, various methods of
compiling data have been developed for
civilian purposes. Project MICHIGAN
is, in effect, adapting them to its pur-
poses. However, the military problem is
much more complex. The many sensing
devices have collected small bits of in-
formation from the various areas of the
battlefield. But in this form, they will
do little good. A complete system for
transmitting, receiving, correlating, and
storing these data must be worked out.
Final Stage
Now the third and final stage of the
system must be considered. After the
battle conditions are sensed and proc-
essed, they must be presented to the com-
manding officers. This problem of pre-
sentation is perhaps the most important
because, in the ideal case, it is not merely
a listing of facts. The facts must be
made available so that the most impor-
tant are emphasized and the trivial de-
emphasized or discarded. If, in some
way, an error is made in this phase of
the system, an extremely important piece
of information may not be brought to
the commander's attention. Therefore,
Project MICHIGAN experts are working
with room-sized computers and other
devices which simulate the various battle
conditions in order that this complex
problem can be studied and analyzed in
the laboratory. These analog and digital
computers, as they are called, can take
into account many phases of a problem
and after scanning all possible combina-
tions can yield the optimum information.
History and the experience of trained
military personnel form a major basis
for the programming of these laboratory
machines.
The resultant information must be
presented in a form readily useable to
the commanders. At WRL, for example,
research is being carried out to show in
a large map-like display the battle area
and to superimpose upon this symbols
representing fighting units. These sym-
bols are not little flags such as one sees
in the movies, but come rather from
oscilloscope traces. Special paper allows
this information to be automatically re-
corded.
A Closer Look
Briefly, we have looked at a part of
the over-all structure of the Project
MICHIGAN research program. Now we
might consider how they are attacking
the problem.
As mentioned previously, WRL has a
large staff for an organization of its
type. Not too surprisingly, more than
half of their workers are college gradu-
ates, while the remainder of the 750 or
so are technicians, draftsmen, and other
supporting staff members. Most of the
trained personnel are graduates in en-
gineering, physics, and mathematics, al-
though there are many staff members
with degrees in psychology, linguistics,
history, and philosophy. Because the
problems under study are so broad, ex-
perts in many diverse fields are re-
quired.
The facilities are excellent. The Proj-
ect MICHIGAN research staff even has
at its disposal nine aircraft including a

Jay Sklar, '60E, a graduate of

Island, is expecting a B.S. degree

tion to being a member of the
1960E Executive Board, Jay is a
member of Eta Kappa Nu, the
electrical engineering honorary.
During his spare time Jay pur-
sues his hobbies, which include
tennis, swimming, Hi-Fi and pho-
tography.

Lady scientists perform many of the
more complex tasks as physicists, psy-
chologists, technical writers, and math-
ematicians at Willow Run Laboratories.
Here is Margaret Spencer (Miss), asso-
ciate research engineer, solving a
problem on an Analog Computer.
Observing is Dr. Robert Hess, head of
Project MICHIGAN.
World War II C-46. Technicians are
highly skilled and available to serve the
entire research staff. Thus, for the re-
search-minded graduate, WRL offers
excellent opportunities to carry out ex-
tensive work with fine facilities.
To gain deeper insight into the pro-
gram, one might look into the specific
jobs of several engineers. Jack Neuhardt,
U-M, is one of those concerned with
sensor development. His special interest
is mathematics, having received his A.B.
and M.S. degrees in that field. He is
now going on for a Ph.D. in Math. Dur-
ing this advanced study at the University,
he has been working in the Radar Labo-
ratory at WRL. His particular task is the
elimination of the errors involved in air-
borne radar tracking systems. As an air-
craft flies over an area, it emits pulses
from its radar equipment. As mentioned
before, the time interval for the reflec-
tion of these signals is measured and
the distance to the reflecting body thereby
determined. But, although the measure-
ment of this time span is simple for
land-based radar equipment, this calcu-
lation is extremely complex for airborne
equipment. During this interval, the air-
plane has moved along its route. Linear
motion, due to the airplane's normal
movement, must be considered. In addi-
tion, oscillatory motions due to air
turbulence and steering variations must
be taken into account. Mr. Neuhardt is
working on methods to determine the
magnitude of these errors and to elim-
inate them from the computation of dis-
tance to the reflecting body.
Reed Maes is another member of the
WRL research team. While working on
his master's degree at the University, he
worked at the laboratories on a three-
day-a-week basis. This points out the
opportunities for work-study programs
with the Willow Run Labs. Part of the
surveillance program involves determin-
ing target locations from sensor returns.
This may sound simple enough. Indeed,
many readers are familiar with the tri-
angulation techniques employed to locate
foundering ships. But, under battle con-
ditions, there are some considerations
that cannot be discussed here which can
make it quite a problem. Solving it is
Mr. Maes' job.
Master Research
Basic research is being done by Robert
Terhune, among others. He received his
Ph.D. in 1957 from the University in
physics. Dr. Terhune is a supervisory
member of the research group which has
discovered and developed the ruby maser.
During work on the surveillance system,
the need was seen for low-noise ampli-
fiers for microwave or radar signals. Con-
ventional vacuum tubes were completely
inadequate and gas masers introduced
large quantities of noise into the signals.
Therefore, work was begun on methods
to reduce the noise. Working under Dr.
Chihiro Kikuchi, Dr. Terhune was helped
to predict and demonstrate the rather
remarkable characteristics of ruby as a
maser material, and has helped devise a
means to employ this ruby maser in a
microwave amplifier. Much of the noise
in gas masers was caused by random
molecular motion, but the ruby maser
is kept at a cool eight degrees above
absolute zero. At this temperature, mole-
cular motion practically ceases and the
noise is virtually eliminated. In one phase
of this solid-state physics program,
Project MICHIGAN'S ruby maser will be
used with the University's radio-tele-
scope at Peach Mountain.
Space prohibits discussions of more
individual tasks. But throughout WRL's
buildings, hundreds of engineers and sci-
entists are working to solve such prob-
lems. Many of them have graduated from
the University and continue to study
there on a part-time basis. Thus, for the
research-minded engineer, there are al-
most endless possibilities in the areas of
applied and basic research at the Willow
Run Laboratories, both during and after
his studies at the University.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


from the day he started work
James C. Bishop got his B.S. in Electrical
Engineering from the University of Illinois on
June 23, 1953. On July 1, he went to work as a
lineman in the Illinois Bell Telephone Company
management training program. On July 2, he
was "shinnying" up telephone poles.
And he's been "climbing" ever since. A
planned rotational training program, interrupted
by a stint in the Army, took Jim through vir-
tually every phase of plant operations.
He was promoted to Station Installation
Foreman in July, 1957. Then came more train-
ing at company expense —in human relations
and other supervisory subjects—at Knox College.
Since early 1958, Jim has been Central
Office Foreman in the Kedzie District of Chicago,
which embraces about 51,000 telephone stations.
He has 19 men reporting to him.
"I was hired as 'a candidate for manage-
ment,'" he says. "I know I'll get the training
and opportunity to keep moving ahead. How far
I go is up to me. I can't ask for more than that."

AND
RESEARCH
Compiled by PETE ANDERSON, '62E
This month's articles cover everything
from the colonization of space to research
on the shape of wheels. Other articles
of possible interest, such as a report of
a new scientific survey are also included.
Satellite Critics
Urbanization of space, in which whole
populations may live in satellite commu-
nities, was one of a number of possibili-
ties for space age of the future mentioned
by a University of Michigan electrical
engineer here recently.
Speaking at a luncheon following
ground-breaking ceremonies for Adrian
College's new Science Building, Prof.
William G. Dow, chairman of the Uni-
versity Electrical Engineering Depart-
ment, said, "A satellite community might
consist of rotating structures which,
through centrifugal force, simulate grav-
ity, which in turn can be as little or as
great as desired.
"Movement from one building to an-
other could be accomplished by moving
to the axis and then jumping to the next
structure, guided by a reaction air jet
on the person's back. The control of
gravity and absence of atmosphere might
make easier and less expensive certain
manufacturing and industrial processes,
such as metal purification without need
for crucibles. Temperatures in a satellite
community could be determined by con-
trolled radiation of the sun's heat."
Other possibilities mentioned by Pro-
fessor Dow in his talk on "Space, Science
and Humanity," were:
(1) Global communication by means
of a chain of small satellites which could
reflect radio signals;
(2) National television coverage from
a single, very powerful station which
would bounce its signal off a satellite,
thus getting around the present diffi-
culties of "line-of-sight" transmision;
(3) Navigation of ships at sea
through use of permanent satellites as
reference objects instead of the sun or
moon;
(4) Satellite air transport to Australia
in one hour, permitting a day's business
and return the same day;
(5) Much improved weather forecast-
ing through television transmission from
satellites to weather stations of cyclonic
cloud coverages.
New Wheel Shape
The wheel, which ranks with the
alphabet and the printing press as one
of man's greatest inventions, is being
made more efficient by University of
Michigan engineers. They are improv-
ing it's "off the road" use.
For from the time some 6,000 years
ago when some inspired and nameless
soul created a wheel of wood or stone
to replace the log rollers being used
under sledges, the emphasis on the wheel
has been to roll it over harder and
smoother surfaces.
This has been so since the first char-
ioteer bounced over a now ancient road,
right down to the millions of dollars
that have gone into finding the most
suitable rubber and synthetic for auto-
mobile tires and toward perfecting super-
highway design and construction. Curi-
ously enough, until now no basic research
has sought to get the best performance
from a wheel on a vehicle moving over
hill and down dale.
How would the engineer at present
determine the diameter, width and sur-
face shape, for instance, of the wheels
on a vehicle designed for swampy or
very soft ground except by building the
vehicle and seeing if it works? What's
best for rocky, bumpy surfaces? How
will various soils respond to repeated
pressure of many wheels on many ve-
hicles?
The research in the University's North
Campus Automotive Laboratory is pro-
ducing for the first time scientific data
applicable to "off the road" wheel be-
havior.
Automatic Automobiles
In a generation or two, kids may for-
get about pestering father for the keys
to the family car.
A Philadelphia architect told a Univer-
sity of Michigan meeting "As surely as
we meet here today, our grandchildren
will simply jump into their air sled, con-
nect to a community digital computer,
dial inputs of destination, speed and
altitude, and be anywhere in a twinkling."
This concept of the future came from
Herbert H. Swinburne, one of 36 experts
from architecture and related disciplines
meeting at the U-M under the auspices
of the American Institute of Architects
(AIA), March 10-12.
Their purpose is to formulate a pro-
gram of architectural research. The pre-
liminary work, still in an exploratory
stage, is financed by a grant of $6,000
from the National Science Foundation.

IBM Engineer George 0. Philip
studies new manufacturing
techniques to apply to production
problems of tomorrow.

Stimulating environment
"IBM uses some of the most advanced electron-
ically controlled production machinery in the
manufacture of its data processing equipment.
My job is to help design and develop even more
'automated' machinery," says George 0. Philip,
Manufacturing Engineer. "I am in charge of the
Machine Tool Automation group of the Manufac-
turing Research Department at Endicott, New
York. Our assignment is to anticipate, three to five
years in advance, future manufacturing methods,
applying new research techniques."
George Philip began a typical day recently by re-
viewing the assignments of the twenty engineers,
designers, and technicians in his group. "Actually,
I don't closely supervise the routine daily activi-
ties of individuals in my group, except in the case
of new men," he explained.
A short while later, he joined several engineers
engaged in developing optical tooling techniques.
"What we hope to do," he explained, "is to take
advantage of the high degree of accuracy and pre-
cision of optical tooling instruments for such
manufacturing applications as gauging, inspect-
ing, and controlling."

Achieving results
Next, he met with one of the designers. Together,
they worked on design changes for a static-switch-
ing element to be included in the logic circuit of
a new machine.
Later, he was called to the manufacturing floor
where one of his finished projects, an automatic
boring machine, was being displayed to engineers
from another plant. He outlined how the machine,
programmed by punched cards, bores holes in the
side-frames of units forming a part of the IBM 650
electronic data processing system. After the visi-
tors had gone, George Philip said, "Working on
the production boring machine provided a tremen-
dous challenge, and its development has been
the most satisfying achievement of my career.
I co-designed the automatic tool-changing device,
and carried it through development. I also used
this subject for my Master's thesis."

Other benefits
Having received his Bachelor's Degree in Mechan-
ical Engineering from Lafayette College, George
Philip earned his Master's Degree in M.E. from
Syracuse University through IBM's Advanced De-
gree Program. This program is available to many
IBM engineers at several locations.
In the afternoon, George Philip worked on the ex-
ploratory designs for another project: a machine
that automatically strings parts onto copper wires
so that the parts can be more easily plated. "This
is one of the three devices for which I have patents
pending," he said. "If you have a worth-while idea,
special equipment and technical advice will be pro-
vided to give your idea every chance for success."
Later, he welcomed a new employee to his group.
This new man, an engineer, came to IBM directly
from college. He asked many questions about
courses available in the General Education Pro-
gram. After he left, George Philip remarked that
in addition to a comprehensive education program
the new employee would have available such other
employee benefits as medical, insurance, and
retirement plans. "Most important, perhaps, is
that you work in small teams, in modern plants
and laboratories. The atmosphere is relaxed and
friendly, and many of our colleagues are tops in
their fields."

Opportunities for advancement
As he was leaving for the evening, George Philip
talked about his chances for advancement. "I've
had two promotions in four years, and I'm pre-
paring for an even more responsible position. The
way IBM is growing, opportunity is assured."

OF AMERICA
by PETE ANDERSON, '62E
Steel is the Iifeblood of America. This
statement was justly made recently
by a government official addressing mem-
bers of the American Steel Institute. For
both defense and civilian purposes steel
is easily the most important fabricating
material. Today's huge intercontinental
ballistic missiles are constructed with
stainless steel to withstand heat and cor-
rosion. The recently completed Mackinac
Bridge which spans the water between
northern and southern Michigan is built
almost entirely of steel. New and stronger
steels are constantly being put into use
in such industries as aircraft, shipbuild-
ing, automobile and construction. Last
year the total steel produced was 148
million tons, more than 30 million tons
more than the capacity at the end of
World War II.
The growth of the steel industry has
been made possible by steady techno-
logical advances in the manufacturing of
steel. The steel industry has developed
and improved for 4,000 years to emerge
today as one of the world's most ad-
vanced. Let us look at the technological
improvements which have made steel
making easier and more profitable.
Prehistoric man first used flint in fash-
ioning his implements. Flint was useful
because it was hard, yet capable of being
shaped. Later he found that ores of
such metals as copper and tin, com-
bined to form "alloys," could be reduced
to yield usable metal. The period in
history during which copper and tin
were used extensively is called the Bronze
Age.
The use of iron implements is evident
during Biblical times, being mentioned
in the early books of the Old Testament.
Iron tools were common in Egypt over
4,000 years ago. The Egyptians and
Assyrians developed a method of ex-

tracting iron from its oxides and thus
obtaining the pure metal which could
then be fashioned into saws, chisels, etc.
Egyptians were making iron swords as
early as 1000 B.C.
The method by which the early iron
tools were made is a relatively simple
one. Ores of selected metals were thrown
on top of a wood fire. The carbon pro-
duced from the burning of wood acted
as a reducing agent to remove the oxy-
gen from the metal oxide (ore). The
formula for the reduction of iron oxide
(Fe.,0.,) is as follows:
2Fe203 + 3C 4Fe -f 3C02
or
Fe20:l + 3C -» 2Fe -f 3CO
The result of this reduction was an
iron that was very brittle and not malle-
able at all. Its high carbon content, which
was near 4% gave it this brittleness. The
iron produced by this method was rela-
tively impure due to deposits of sulfur,
silicon, phosphorus and manganese.
The first blast furnace, perfected near
the beginning of the Norman conquest
of England (1066), was the first of
several inventions which made possible
production of great quantities of iron
and steel. Through the use of the blast
furnace iron oxides were reduced by car-
bon from the combustion of wood. High
temperatures in the furnace made the
reduction of iron oxide easier. The prob-
lem still remained, however, of making
the iron soft and malleable.
Blast furnace improvements soon fol-
lowed. One of the first Watt steam
engines was used to power a blower
which induced a powerful draft in the
furnace. By this method the wood was
made to burn more rapidly, and the use
of coal as a fuel was also introduced
during this period. By 1730 coke, a coal
product, was greatly increasing in popu-
larity over coal. It was also during the
18th century that metallurgists began to
realize that the difference between
wrought iron, cast iron, and steel was in
the carbon content.
Probably the most important inven-
tion in the steel industry was that of
Henry Bessemer in 1856. The Bessemer
converter was a device which reduced
the carbon content of cast iron, thus
producing steel. One day while melting
carbon-rich cast iron Bessemer noticed
that portions of the iron which were ex-
posed to the air had become soft and
malleable. Deducing that the contact
with the atmosphere had brought about
the de-carbonizing, he set to work to
design a furnace which would allow a
maximum amount of air to reach the
cast iron. The fruit of his efforts, the
first Bessemer converter, was a melting
furnace with an air pipe projecting down
into the molten metal. When the metal
was fully melted he introduced air into
the pipe. The air bubbled through the
molten metal. After 30 minutes he
stopped the process and examined the
metal. He found that it was soft and
ductile, indicating that the carbon con-
tent had been greatly reduced. Thus,
Bessemer had found the first practical
method of producing low carbon steel

and iron in great quantities and at low
cost. Careful investigation uncovered the
fact that oxygen combined with the car-
bon in the steel according to the follow-
ing formula:
2C + 02 -&gt; 2CO
or
C -f o2 -&gt; co2
The invention of the open hearth fur-
nace soon followed. The open hearth
made it possible to produce low carbon
steel and iron of higher quality than
possible with the Bessemer converter.
Today the open hearth process produces
the bulk of steel and wrought iron in
this country.
Today's steel industry goes further
than just producing good quality low
carbon steel. In addition to reducing
the ore and removing much of the car-
bon, many steel plants roll and shape
steel into beams, rails, and sheets. This
forming process is usually done while
the steel is hot and easily formed. l arge
rollers continually reduce great rectang-
ular blocks into long rolls. Rolled steel
is used to a great extent in the automo-
bile industry where such items as fenders,
doors, and bodies are stamped out much
like cookies are cut out by a cookie
cutter.
Thus, through great technological ad-
vancements, today's steel industry is pro-
ducing quality steel in quantities which
were undreamed of in the nineteenth
century—only an instant ago compared
with the ancient history of the steel in-
dustry.

These devices, whose basic principle of opera-
tion lies in quantum theory, amplify sound with-
out the slightest distortion. by RAY IKOLA, '62E
Improved reception of radio waves
from outer space—timing devices
which are unbelievably accurate—both
of these are now possible through the
use of a new device in the field of micro-
waves. This device is known as a
"maser." The word "maser" is actually
an abreviation of "microwave amplifica-
tion by stimulated emission of radiation."
The chief advantage of the maser over
the conventional vacuum tube amplifier
is its noise-free operation. This intrinsic
noiselessness makes it possible for the
maser to detect a very weak radio wave.
Thus, masers are now being used in con-
junction with radio telescopes to detect
very weak signals from outer space.
The basic theory of the maser was
developed only a few years ago by several
men working independently of each
other. Among those to be noted for this
development are C. H. Townes of
Columbia University, J. Weber of the
University of Maryland, and N. G. Basov
and A. M. Prokhorov of the U.S.S.R.
As the reader is probably aware, the
vacuum tube amplifier utilizes a stream
of electrons upon which the incoming
signal imposes certain variations. How-
ever, the electrons in the stream itself
each have certain small variations of their
own. These small variations are detected
as noise in the output of the tube. A
maser eludes the inherent noise of the
vacuum tube by dispensing with the use
of a stream of electrons.
Relies On Quantum Theory
To understand the underlying prin-
cipal of the maser, we must accept the
quantum theory of matter and radiation.
According to this theory, all electrons,
atoms and molecules may exist in one of
a number of different fixed energy levels.
The difference in energy between any
two levels is equal to the energy of one
quantum. A quantum, by the quantum
theory, is a discrete bundle of energy of
which all electromagnetic radiation is
composed. In other words, all radiation
is discontinuous, being made up of many
of these discrete quantities of energy.
The energy of a quantum can be calcu-
lated from Planck's equation which states
that:
E = hv
where E = energy of a quantum,
h = Planck's constant = 6.624
X 10"'-'T erg-sec,
v = frequency of radiation in
sec."1
Since there is a difference of one quan-
tum between energy levels of the elec-
tron, we can see that if an electron should
jump from a low energy level to a high
one, it would necessarily absorb one
quantum of energy. By the same reason-
ing, if an electron jumped from a high
energy level to one below it, one quant-
um of energy would be emitted. Keep-
ing these facts in mind, we now turn to
the effect of radiation on matter. It is

on matter by passing radiation through
it, it is necessary that the energy of the
radiation be exactly equal to the dif-
ference in energy between any two energy
levels of the electron. If the energy of
the radiation is not equal to this differ-
ence, no effect on the matter can be
observed. However, if the radiation is
of the correct energy, either of two dif-
ferent effects may be produced. In the
first case, a quantum strikes an atom
whose electrons are in a low energy level.
This causes the electron to jump to a
higher level, and the quantum of radia-
tion is absorbed. This is usually the
effect observed, since the electrons tend
to seek the lowest energy level, thereby
producing a greater density of low
energy electrons. Of course this means
that the radiation has a greater chance to
strike a low energy electron than a high
energy electron. If, however, the quan-
tum strikes a high energy electron, the
opposite effect is produced. In this case
the collision causes the electron to jump
to the next lower energy level. We have
already seen that this sort of jump (from
a high energy level to a low energy
level) produces a quantum of energy.
Therefore, we now have two quanta
where originally we had only one. If
we can somehow excite a great number
of electrons to the high energy level,
where normally they would be at low
energy, we can succeed in amplifying the
initial radiation. This, then, is the prin-
cipal under which the maser operates.
The only problem remaining is to put a
sufficient number of electrons into the
high energy state.
Ammonia Maser Not Ideal
In the line of history, the first oper-
ational maser to be developed utilized
an ammonia molecule. Since the purpose
of this article is to discuss a more recent
development, that of solid-state masers,
let it suffice to say that the ammonia
The complicated apparatus in this pic-
ture is used extensively in research of
traveling solid state masers.
maser utilizes the energy jump of whole
molecule rather than the energy jump of
an individual electron. For many rea-
sons, the ammonia maser is usually used
as an oscillator rather than an amplifier.
It has been postulated that if an ammonia
maser were used to regulate a clock, the
clock should be true to within one second
in a few hundred years! However, as an
amplifier the ammonia maser falls short
of ideality. It is difficult to change the
central frequency. In other words, it
cannot be easily tuned. (Hereafter, we
will refer to the central frequency of the
maser, rather than the difference in
energy levels, since by Planck's equation
the energy is directly proportional to the
frequency). Another disadvantage of
the ammonia maser is that it has a very
narrow band-width. Any radiation that
differs from the central frequency of the
maser by more than 3,000 to 5,000
cycles will not be amplified.
Electron Jumps Used
The solid-state maser is able to over-
come the problems of the ammonia
maser, thereby making it more suitable
for use as an amplifier. The basic dif-
ference between the solid-state maser and
the ammonia maser is that the solid-state
maser utilizes the jumps of electrons be-
tween energy levels rather than an
energy jump of a whole molecule. It is
an accepted fact that each electron can
be looked upon as a small spinning
magnet. If all the electrons in an atom
are paired, they are arranged so that op-
posite poles are nearest each other,
thereby cancelling each others magnetism.
However, all the electrons are not paired
in some substances. In this case, the
substance takes on magnetic properties
and is called "paramagnetic." Let us
place a substance such as this in a mag-
netic field and observe what happens.
Again referring to the quantum theory,
we find that there are two possible ways
for the electron to orientate itself in this
magnetic field. In one case, the spin
axis of the electron is pointed in the
direction of the external field, and in
the other case it is pointed in the op-
posite direction. These two positions
correspond to the different energy levels
of the electron. The electron is in the
high level when the spin axis points in
the same direction as the external field
and in the low level when the spin axis
points in the opposite direction. Under
normal conditions, there is a greater
tendency for the electrons to be in the
low energy state. The difference in
energy levels is dependent on the
strength of the magnetic field into which
the electrons are placed. We see, then,

MAY, 1959


that we can tune the maser (change its
central frequency) by simply changing
the strength of the magnetic field. This
is the big advantage of the solid-state
maser.
In order to get maser action, we must
put a sufficient number of electrons into
the high energy state. This is best ac-
complished by first cooling the maser
substance down to the region of absolute
zero. In this super-cooled condition, most
of the electrons drop to the lowest energy
level. (Keep in mind that the maser
substance is in a magnetic field during
this process.) It is then possible to pass
a microwave corresponding to the cen-
tral frequency through the substance.
This boosts the electrons to the high
energy level, with the original microwave
being attenuated. If we then pass
through the maser the signal you wish
to have amplified, the electrons will jump
back to the lower energy level, with a
corresponding radiation of energy. Thus
the signal is amplified. Remember,
however, that the frequency of the signal
must correspond to the central frequency
of the maser.
Generally, there are two types of solid-
state masers. They are called the "two
level" and the "three level." These terms
describe the basic difference between the
two types. In the two level maser there
are two different energy levels available.
Similarly, the three-level maser has three
energy levels available. The two-level
maser utilizes a material which has one
extra electron. This type of arrangement
is not completely desirable, since it can
only be operated in "spurts." It is neces-
sary to keep repeating the cycle of ex-
citing the electrons to the high energy
state and then causing them to jump back
down upon amplifying the signal. The
signal can be amplified only when the
electrons are in the excited state, and
therefore the maser cannot be operated
continuously.
Continuous Amplification
The inherent problems of the two-level
maser were overcome with the develop-
ment of the three-level maser. Nicholas
Bloembergen of Harvard University is
the man credited with this. For this type
of maser it is necessary to have a sub-
stance which has more than one un-
paired electron in each atom. Two ex-
amples of this type of substance are the
elements iron and chromium. Chromium
has three unpaired electrons per atom,
and has four possible energy levels.
Chromium is also present in an artificial
ruby crystal of which a great many solid-
state masers are made. The point is, we
need at least three energy levels. If we
have four available, as in the ruby crystal,
we may use any three. Let us use the
ruby crystal to illustrate the operation
of the three-level maser. As we have
shown before, the crystal is first placed
in a resonant cavity and cooled in a bath
of liquid helium to the region near ab-
solute zero. The electrons are now ar-
ranged so that there are just a few at
the highest energy level, a few more at
the middle level, and still more at the
lowest level. A microwave is then passed
through the crystal to "pump" electrons
from the lowest to the highest level (to
produce this jump the microwave must
be of the frequency corresponding to the
difference between energy levels of the
electrons.) The electrons are now dis-
tributed so that there are more electrons
at the lower and higher levels with fewer
electrons found at the middle level. The
frequency of the signal which boosts the
electrons to the higher energy level is
called the "pumping" frequency. The
frequency of the signal we wish to am-
plify is the frequency which corresponds
to the difference in energy between the
highest and middle energy levels. The
cavity into which the crystal is placed
must be resonant to both the "pumping"
frequency and the amplifying frequency.
Since there are three levels available, it
is possible to continue the "pumping"
action at the same time the signal is be-
ing amplified. We then have an amplifier
which operates continuously.
Research Continues
Research on the maser has by no means
come to a halt. Throughout the country
scientists and engineers are trying to im-
prove the characteristics of the solid-state
maser. At the University of Michigan
work is being carried out to improve the
bandwidth through the use of a traveling
wave type of maser. Perhaps in the near
future we will see masers come into gen-
eral use by the public in place of the
present vacuum tube amplifier.

Vought offers this range
to the young engineer
At Chance Vought the engineer's assign-
ments range from the depths of the ocean to
the farthest reaches of space ... from hard-
ware operating aboard the Navy's nuclear-
armed submarines to space research vehicles
still on the boards.
Here the engineer contributes to projects
such as the record-smashing Crusader jet
fighter series ... antisubmarine warfare
studies . .. missile system and space capsule
development, details of which are classified.
Under the guidance of the Vought engi-
neer, such weapons take shape. He super-
vises critical tests, and he introduces the
weapons to the men with whom they
will serve.
Engineers with many specialties share these
experiences. Today, for example, Vought is
at work on important projects involving:
SPACECRAFT AND ASTRONAUTICS
ADVANCED PROPULSION METHODS
ELECTRONICS DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE
ANTISUBMARINE WARFARE
Vought's excellent R&amp;D facilities help the
engineer through unexplored areas. And by
teaming up with other specialists against
mutual challenges, the Vought engineer
learns new fields while advancing in his own.

ASTRODYNAMICISTS. OCEANOGRAPHERS. Their perspectives are worlds apart.
But a broad search for advanced weapons is bringing them and other diverse specialists
together at Chance Vought.
Opportunities are unlimited for young engineers as Vought advances into new
weapons areas.
This advance is the natural outcome of 42 years of successful design and manufacture
of high-performance weapon systems. Vought ranks among the nation's topmost
sources of fighter aircraft, with the F8U-1 Crusader fighter and the F8U-1P Crusader
reconnaissance aircraft on duty with both Fleets. An even deadlier version of the
Crusader, the F8U-2N, is scheduled for Fleet service in 1960.

DALLAS, TEXAS
Today at Chance Vought, development work fans out into virtually every dimension
of weapon systems.
ANTISUBMARINE WARFARE (ASW). Vought is engaged in ASW studies under
the Office of Naval Research and the Bureau of Aeronautics. Extensive research and
development is being done in the vital detection and classification phases. Goal is
to bring detection abreast of destruction capabilities.
Vought applies to this work a pre-eminent background in sea-going missiles: II
years' experience in installing, testing, observing Regulus Fleet missiles; an intimate
knowledge of submarines.
ASTRONAUTICS. Vought is advancing the technology of the man-carrying portion
of space vehicles. A reputation for "human factors" know-how in advanced aircraft
development has won contract assignments for space capsule development. The
company is adding research and test facilities for advanced regimes of speeds and
heats. And, through "space seminars," the company's most experienced space scientists
are orienting the entire engineering organization for space projects.
WEAPON SYSTEM PLANNING, ANALYSIS. Vought specialists are determining
future weapons requirements; defining new areas for closer evaluation. For example,
Vought's advanced weapons thinking has branched out into the area of new, sophisti-
cated battlefield weapons. This area has proved promising and well within Vought's
weapons development capabilities. Also under way are studies of nuclear-powered
missiles and other original applications for today's growth of propulsion possibilities.
In this area, breakthroughs already have been scored in antenna design, in structural
design for re-entry heat, and in controls and hydraulics.

A gang of boys made a raid on the
Perkins orchard and came back with a
quantity of apples, which were then
pooled and divided equally among them.
Micheal said he thought it would be
fairer to share by families instead of by
individuals. As there were two John-
son brothers and two Fairbanks brothers,
redivision by families would have in-
creased each share by 3 apples. With the
argument at its height, along came Fred,
who, being the oldest of the gang, was
appealed to as arbiter. Fred decided that
it would be unfair to share by families.
Furthermore, he pointed out, he himself
would certainly have participated in the
raid, to the great increase of booty, had
he not been detained by a compulsory
engagement with a rugbeater. But as
head of the gang he was entitled to a
share. Fred had a way of winning his
arguments, so each boy contributed one
apple to him, making equal shares all
around. How many apples did the boys
gather?

The flight testing of second generation missiles—more versatile
and powerful than their predecessors—requires a device for sure
termination of any missile flight that might endanger the test
range or surrounding area.
Ramo-Wooldridge engineers, under a United States Army Signal
Corps contract, have successfully developed and delivered the
first sub-miniature, completely transistorized radio "command
destruct" receivers.
Specifically designed for missile flight safety operations, the
receiver (AN/DRW-11) can actuate safety mechanisms or destruct
devices. It has three command channels, each of which actuates
a control relay.
The "command destruct" receiver accepts frequency modulated
signals in the UHF radio command control band. It is designed
to operate with closer radio frequency and command frequency
channel spacing than has been used to date, thus making possible
more efficient use of the available radio spectrum.
Compact and rugged, the radio receiver's modular construction
permits rapid and complete accessibility to all components. One
module houses the basic receiver. The second module contains
the three command channels and relays. This integrated package
occupies 115 cubic inches, and weighs 4 pounds. The receiver
requires no pressurization and operates reliably under the adverse
environmental conditions encountered in missile flight testing.
Engineers and scientists interested in being associated with some
of the nation's most advanced research and development programs
are invited to acquaint themselves with current opportunities at
Ramo-Wooldridge. The areas of activity listed below are those
in which R-W is now engaged and in which openings exist.

built; however, the project is valid for all
time as an unexecuted masterpiece in
the art of concrete construction."
Maillart deplored the idea of the "cal-
culator." He felt that a constructor should
continually experiment, constantly alter
and improve his work. Maillart dictated
changes in construction on the spot, ad-
justing his structure to the existing con-
ditions of terrain and materials. It is no
coincidence that the architect Frank
Lloyd Wright also constructed his build-
ings in this manner, changing the design
again and again as the structure was
erected. The work of both Wright and
Maillart is organic, each one has a sense
of what his materials are capable of.
Both have produced structures which are
unique in their plastic qualities and at
the same time are charged with freshness
and strength.
Since Maillart's death in 1940 there
has been a great reevaluation of his work.
Max Bill predicts eventual pilgrimages
of people from all over the world to see
his work. He expects the "discovery" of
Maillart to parallel the discovery of
other abstract painters who have re-
mained relatively unknown.
What Next?
Any reevaluation of Maillart's work
leads inevitably to the question "what is
the next step?" Does the reinforced con-
crete bridge end with Maillart? If Mail-
lart had lived another 20 years what im-
provements would he have made in this
type of construction?
Some critics retort that the Aarve or
Thur bridge was the culmination of rein-
forced concrete design. Little improve-
ment could be made either in its aesthetic
or economic properties.
Other critics have disagreed. Bridge
design must inevitably invade the realm
of architecture. It must retain its own
purity of expression while attempting
to conquer interior space. Designs for
bridges have been submitted where the
plasticity of the material is utilized to
form an interior so that the traffic flows
through the structure.
In any case, we see now that Robert
Maillart was a rare man. In an age when
the engineer is credited only for the
magnitude of his performance—"the
longest pipeline," "the highest sky-
scraper," Maillart's achievement is even
more noteworthy. The ability to merge
technical as well as artistic ability seems
to grow rarer. Maillart's example must
serve to convince not only the public,
but practicing engineers as well, that cre-
ative expression is not the function of
the painter and sculptor alone.

Electrical Engineering
Research in properties of the Earth's "upper atmosphere," the region above an altitude of approximately
twenty miles, is receiving new emphasis with the coming of the "Space Age."
Rocket probing of the upper atmosphere, including the measurement of the air pressure, temperature,
density and composition has interested University researchers for over twelve years and has been inten-
sively pursued through the launching of over fifty rocket experiments by the Space Physics Research
Laboratory of the Electrical Engineering Department and the High Altitude Engineering Laboratory of the
Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering Department. Pressure gages have been carried to high
altitudes and bottles have gathered samples of air. More recently, objects specifically tailored to their
measurement objective have been and are being launched. The illustration above, an artist's conception
of the ejection of one such device into the Earth's ionosphere, shows how scientists can carry out experi-
ments in space away from the pernicious effects of rocket carriers. In this instance new localized meas-
urements of ionospheric electron temperature and density are being made. Reception of the telemetered
information at ground stations will provide a large volume of new data which will be studied by the
researchers to obtain the desired scientific results and to enable equipment improvements.

PLAN TOMORROW
By knowing about some of the projects underway at the
Babcock &amp; Wilcox Company, an engineer may see his
personal avenues of growth and advancement. For today
B&amp;W stands poised at a new era of expansion and
development.
Here's an indication of what's going on at B&amp;W, with
the consequent opportunities that are opening up for
engineers. The Boiler Division is building the world's
largest steam generator. The Tubular Products Division
recently introduced extruded seamless titanium tubing,
one result of its metallurgical research. The Refractories
Division developed the first refractory concrete that will
withstand temperatures up to 3200 F. The Atomic Energy
Division is under contract by the AEC to design and
build the propulsion unit of the world's first nuclear-
powered cargo vessel.
These are but a few of the projects — not in the plan-
ning stage, but in the actual design and manufacturing
phases — upon which B&amp;W engineers are now engaged.
The continuing, integrated growth of the company offers
engineers an assured future of leadeiship.

How to look out a window before the building is up

With 180 "view'apartments

turned to photography
to get a jump on sales
A feature of The Comstock, San

the spectacular panoramic views
of the Bay area from their picture
windows.
How could these views be spread
before prospective buyers—before

opers, Albert-Lovett Co., found the
answer in photography. From a
gondola suspended from a crane,
color photos were made from the
positions of the future apartments.
Now, the sales representative not
only points out the location of a
possible apartment on a scale
model, but shows you the view
from your window as well.
Photography rates high as a

General Electric interviews
Dr. Richard Folsom, President of
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,
to explore . . .
Teaching—
A Career Opportunity
For the Engineer
Leading educators, statesmen and in-
dustrialists throughout the country are
greatly concerned with the current
shortage of high-caliber graduates who
are seriously considering a career in the
field of science or engineering educa-
tion. Consequently, General Electric has
taken this opportunity to explore, with
one of America's eminent educators, the
opportunities and rewards teaching of-
fers the scientific or engineering student.
Q. Is there in fact a current and con-
tinuing need for educators in technical
colleges and universities?
A. Colleges and universities providing
scientific and engineering educational
opportunities are hard pressed at the
present moment to obtain the services
of a sufficient number of well-qualified
teachers to adequately carry out their
programs. Projected statistical studies
show that this critical need could ex-
tend over the next 15 or 20 years.
Q. Why is this need not being met?
A. There are probably three main rea-
sons. These might be classed under con-
ditions of financial return, prestige as-
sociated with the position, and lack
of knowledge and understanding on the
part of the college student of the ad-
vantages and rewards teaching as a
career can afford.
Q. What steps have been taken to make
education a more attractive field to en-
gineering students?
A. Steps are being taken in all areas.
For example, we have seen a great deal
in the newspapers relating educators'
salaries to the importance of the job
they are doing. Indications are that
these efforts are beginning to bear fruit.
Greater professional stature is being
achieved as the general public under-
stands that the youth of our nation is
the most valuable natural resource that
we possess . . . and that those associated
with the education of this youth have
one of the most important assignments
in our country today.
Q. Aside from salary, what rewards can
a career in education offer as opposed
to careers in government or industry?
A. The principal rewards might be free-
dom to pursue your own ideas within
the general framework of the school, in
teaching, research and consulting activ-
ities. As colleges and universities are
normally organized, a man has three
months in the summer time to engage
in activities of his own choice. In addi-
tion, the educator is in direct contact
with students and he has the satisfac-
tion of seeing these students develop
under his direction ... to see them take
important positions in local and na-
tional affairs.
Q. What preparation should an en-
gineering student undertake for a teach-
ing career?
A. In college, the engineering student
should obtain a basic understanding of
science, engineering science, humanities
and social sciences with some applica-
tions in one or more professional en-
gineering areas. He should have fre-
quent career discussions with faculty
members and his dean. During graduate
work, a desirable activity, the student
should have an opportunity to do some
teaching.
Q. Must an engineering student obtain
advanced degrees before he can teach?
A. It is not absolutely necessary. On the
other hand, without advanced degrees,
advancement in the academic world
would be extremely difficult.
Q. How valuable do you feel industrial
experience is to an engineering or scien-
tific educator?
A. Industrial experience for a science

educator is desirable; however, with a
senior engineering educator, industrial
experience is a "must". An ideal en-
gineering educator should have had
enough industrial experience so that he
understands the problems and responsi-
bilities in carrying a project from its
formative stages to successful comple-
tion, including not only the technical
aspects, but the economic and personal
relationships also.
O. What do you consider to be the op-
timum method by which an educator can
obtain industrial experience?
A. There are many methods. After
completion of graduate school, perhaps
the most beneficial is a limited but in-
tensive work period in industry. Con-
sulting during an academic year or
summer is a helpful activity and is
desirable for older members of the
staff. Younger educators usually need
experience in "living with the job"
rather than providing consultant's ad-
vice to the responsible individual.
Q. Based on your experience, what per-
sonal characteristics are possessed by
successful professors?
A. Primarily, successful professors have
an excellent and growing knowledge of
their subjects, are interested in people,
and transmit enthusiasm. They have an
ability to explain and impart informa-
tion with ease. They generate ideas and
carry them out because they are de-
voted to developing their fields of
knowledge. They desire personal free-
dom and action.
