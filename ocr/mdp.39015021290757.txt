How the Department of Engineering Research
of the University of Michigan Serves
.. the Industries of the State
The Department of Engineering Re-
search of the University of Michigan is
designed to assist the industries of the
State in placing at their disposal the en-
tire scientific resources of the Univer-
sity.
It is not organized for the mere run-
ning of routine tests or the solution of
minor shop problems, but for the ex-
haustive study;^anji investigation of
scientific maniifa-cfuring problems crit-
ical to the progress of forward look-
ing industries.
Through this Department the manu-
facturer may secure the service of
trained scientists, special laboratories,
library facilities and testing equipment
of exceptional sort, and the sustained
and thorough quality of research work
which is to be found in a great uni-
versity.
Under the present generous patent
arrangements, clients of the Depart-
ment may, by the payment of a some-
what higher service charge, secure the
benefits to be derived from all inven-
tions, patents and patenable processes
resulting from the investigations made
in their behalf.
All problems submitted to the De-
partment should be addressed to the
Director. Such problems will be care-
fully studied and only those will be
undertaken in which it is felt that the
Department may be of service to the
prospective client. The regular service
charge for such work is thirty per cent,
based on labor.

EURTH down! Seconds to playl De-
ending a slender one-point margin
of victory, eleven husky bodies have
valiantly repulsed three smashing at-
tacks which have advanced the ball a
scant foot to the fifteen-yard line.
With success almost certainly within
the defenders' grasp, the field goal
specialist drops far back behind his
stalwart line. A crashing impact — a
blur of rushing bodies — and his
nimble foot sends the ball spinning
high between the goal posts for the
winning points!
Shift this scene to a battle ground of
modern business. The goal is an im-
portant contract ... a substantial
order for electrical equipment or ap-
pliances. Salesmanship, backed by a
product of established quality, plays
its important part; but a Westinghouse
representative is more than a salesman.
The background of specialized engi-
neering knowledge that so often en-
ables him to serve his customers as a
consultant in electrification, is what
supplies the necessary "punch"' to win.
To many a younger college man
with Westinghouse has come the op-
portunity to apply his talent toward
the conclusion of a worthwhile trans-
action. The young men whose photo-
graphs appear on this page are but a
few of many who, with college only a
few years behind them, are finding
success with an organization offering
such a variety of opportunities in the
world's electrical work.

GENESIS CE THE SKYSCRAPER
RANDOLPH SCXTCN, A. I. A.
THE social, economic and industrial condi-
tions, in fact, the whole mode of living of the
people of a community, as well as the traits
of the individuals, are very markedly influenced by
the prevailing climate. In a
country of such vast size as ours
it is, therefore, only natural, on
account of the difference in clim-
ate in the various sections, that
the habits and customs charac-
teristic of the people of one lo-
cality are so much at variance
with those of another. To a
certain extent this is unfortu-
nate, for the peculiarities and
characteristics of the people of
the country as a nation are less
easily distinguished, and our na-
tionalism is to some degree, thus
lost sight of. New Englanders
have, for example, always taken
a certain pride in the customs
which distinguish them from
New Yorkers. Chicagoans claim
that they can recognize a neigh-
bor, no matter how far from
home; as for a New Yorker—
well, he is insulted if someone
thinks he comes from Main
Street. So an American is first
of all a Bostonian, New Yorker or Chicagoan. And
so it has always been with our architecture.
There is not, and until recently it seemed as if
there never would be, a distinctly American style
THK BUHL BUILDING IN DETROIT
EXEMPLIFIES THE TRANSITION-
AL SPIRIT OF MODERNISM
of architecture. There are certain types of build-
ings that are especially characteristic of certain lo-
calities, but no one type can be said to typify the
American style of design. This state of affairs, too,
can be traced to climate and
consequent social conditions,
for architectural design, based
as it is on structure, is itself
very largely governed by clim-
ate. Certain building mate-
rials are more popular in cer-
tain localities for they with-
stand the climate of that partic-
ular section of the country,
while in another section they
would soon perish. Then, too,
old traditions have an influ-
ence on architecture, just as
they do on habits and customs,
and another line is drawn be-
tween buildings of different lo-
calities. In the great South-
west the design of buildings
follows closely the tradition of
the old Spanish settlers and
their missions, which were pe-
culiar to the climate and cus-
toms of the people of that lo-
cality in both design and
structure. In the Middle At-
lantic section the Grecian influence, typical of Co-
lonial days, is still discernible. In New England
the characteristics of the early American inhabi-
tants continue in evidence, while in New York the

skyscraper has become the feature. All these types
can be directly traced to climate which dictates
building materials and methods of construction.
The resulting habits and customs of the people, and
even geographical status, especially in the case of
New York, has had some influence. And so we
have come through these one hundred and fifty
years minus a style of architectural design that we
can definitely point out as being distinctly Ameri-
can, in a truly national sense.
Of these various types of buildings, typical of the
various localities of this country, the skyscraper
stands alone as being purely American. The origin
of some of the other types may be readily traced as
to early English, the Spanish, or to the Roman
classic, but the skyscraper is based on a precedent
written in the entire history of architecture
throughout the world. It represents actually a style
of architecture rather than a
type of building. The prob-
lem of design and construc-
tion, which it has always of-
fered, differs so from any-
thing that has ever been pre-
sented in architecture and
building before, that tradition,
and precedent too, are of no
value whatever in its solution.
The skyscraper differs from old
time building principally in its
mass. Never in the history of
architecture and building have
structures risen to such
heights! Its problem, as all
problems in architecture have
always been, was based on the
relationship of mass and voids,
but while the voids remained
the same as they had always
been—for the sizes of doors
and windows are practically
fixed—the mass was of pro-
portions never before even con-
sidered. It is only natural,
then, that architects centered their interest on the
designs of the mass, and gave little thought in com-
parison, to ornamental details. And such an un-
usual problem as this one seemed to offer unlimited
opportunities and possibilities to the architect.
In the history of architecture, during the last four
hundred years especially, styles and periods in arch-
itectural design were distinguished by their orna-
ment more than their mass. The mass was prac-
tically unified after Gothic times, and the style of a
building was characterized by its ornamental de-
tails. The difference in building materials and con-
sequent methods of construction characteristic of a
building of the Louis XVI period, as was opposed
NEW YORK SKYSCRAPERS ILLUS-
TRATE DESIGN AT A HIGHLY
DEVELOPED STAGE
to those characteristic of a structure of the Georgian
style, was primarily in its ornamental detail. Just
so, the early American house differs from the Ja-
cobean house in England, if it differs at all, in its
detail, not in its mass. To anyone who is in the
slightest degree observing, this characteristic of de-
tails is easily noticed. The clear, crisp lines of the
early American details reflect the cool graceful atti-
tude of the early Colonists. It was amidst these
settings that the merchants first began to barter
with land and buildings which resulted in our mod-
ern skyscraper.
The American skyscraper, however, reversed the
old order. It was not only a new style of archi-
tecture, but in reality a new architecture. It is not
strange, therefore, that architects turned their at-
tention entirely to this phase of its design and rele-
gated the design of ornamental details to second
place. But the skyscraper
suffered by this condition.
The American skyscrapers rep-
resentative of a new Ameri-
can architecture, clothed in
European ornament of four
and five centuries before, lost
its nationality entirely. For
fifty years, from its earliest
conception to most recent
times, one might well say that
the American skyscraper was
not American at all. For orna-
mental detail, architects and
designers of skyscrapers adopt
(as we say, to avoid plagiar-
ism, but we mean actually to
apply) forms and motifs of old
European styles and periods
without regard to materials or
structure, to say nothing of
habits and customs, climate or
tradition.
In spite, then, of certain fea-
tures which would seem to
stamp it as purely American,
the skyscraper, adorned and embellished witn orna-
ment of European origin, lost whatever individual-
ity it possessed, and in our large cities Classic,
Renaissance, Gothic and even Italian skyscrapers
vied with one another for prominence. In at-
tempting to adopt forms and details peculiar to
European conditions of the sixteenth and seven-
teenth centuries to a structural mass characteristic
of America of the twentieth century, progress in the
new architecture was delayed.
In attempt to perfect mass design, intensifying on
that problem to such an extent that ornament was
relegated to second consideration, the architect in

WHAT SHALL I READ?
I9IOC3RAPI-HEJT
J. PALEIGH NELSON, PECEESSCP €P ENGLISH
I will admit at the outset that I chose the two
books on which I am commenting this month
from quite selfish and personal motives. I really
did not have my section in the Technic nor its read-
ers much in mind. It was summer time and I
wanted to read what I wanted to read. But as some-
times happens, I found so much of interest in the
books of my choice that I cannot refrain from shar-
ing with my readers some of the
impressions I received. I believe
also that I can recommend them
both to anyone who is interested
in extending and enriching his
background by familiarizing him-
self with two great epochs in his-
tory.
I was prompted to read The
Raven partly, I suppose, because
it is a study of the life of Sam
Houston, one of the most ro-
mantic and picturesque figures in
our American history,—a dim,
epic figure that has fascinated me
from my boyhood, about whom
has gathered a rich tradition of
seemingly impossible achievement.
I was most consciously influenced
to read the life of Houston, how-
ever, by the fact that it had re-
ceived the Pulitzer prize for 1929,
as the best biography of the year.
I find it necessary occasionally to
check my own judgments against
those of some of the prize-awarding boards. I
sometimes find myself quite at variance with their
decisions. Often I am baffled to know on what
basis they have proceeded. I do honestly try, how-
ever, to get their point of view, and to see in the
blue ribbon specimen of their choice what they
have seen and pronounced good. Even though I
may, and often do, hold to my more conservative
ideals, I do manage in this way to keep my critical
faculties from falling too far behind the changing
standards of my age. The reading of The Raven
was, therefore, a sort of intelligence test.
Having read this prize book, I am quite ready to
accord enthusiastically with the judgment of the
Board. It is a typical "new biography": it appeals
to the imagination like fiction; it stirs ones blood
with its conscious use of great dramatic episodes;
it rises to thrilling climaxes; it is frankly more
IT is with genuine en-
thusiasm that we again
welcome Professor Nel-
son to our readers. We
have long been conscious
of the interest that "What
Shall I Read" has created
among our readers. This
month the discussion con-
cerns two renown figures
of history. Sam Hous-
ton, the turbulent threat
from Tennessee, who
stormed through the
tragic era of Andrew
Jackson is one. The other

emotional than critical in its use of historical mate-
rial. But it lacks the evidence of hasty composition
that mar some of the "new biographies": it com-
mands respect and credence. One feels that the
figure of the great empire builder is reasonably au-
thentic, and the political background is sufficiently
detailed without being confused.
No figure in American history, unless it be Aaron
Burr, would seem to lend itself
more easily to this vivid, romantic
treatment. At thirty-six Sam Hous-
ton had already an honorable mili-
tary career, held the rank of a ma-
jor general, had been a member of
Congress, was not only governor
of Tennessee, but as the protege
of Andrew Jackson, seemed clear-
ly marked for the presidency of
the United States as Tennessee's
young Man of Destiny. Then,
for reasons which he never di-
vulged, following a brief marriage
of three months, he suddenly left
his young wife and went into vol-
untary exile among the Chero-
kees. He destroyed his civilized
clothes, changed his name, and
renounced his American citizen-
ship and his English tongue. He
was adopted into the tribe as the
son of Oo-loo-te-ka, the grept
chief, whose dreams of empire
rank him with Pontiac and Tecumseh, and within
eight weeks had thrust himself into a position of
leadership over seven thousand Indians who con-
trolled the country from Missouri to Texas.
But as he himself wrote, the fruit of this world
had turned to ashes and the charm of life was
broken. His swift dramatic entrance into the tangle
of Indian affairs was followed by a dark year in
which he sank to the depths to which the squaw
man often sinks. In August of that dark year he
was summoned to the death bed of his mother
whom he adored. Her death roused him from the
dull lethargy which had possessed him. He took
his place in the National Council of the Cherokees
and within a few months was in Washington as their
envoy to the National Government. Here a public
caning which he administered to Senator Stanbery

STONE THROUGH THE AGES
E. DAVID HEEGET
"X"T T"^"HEN our ancient ancestors faced the
\ V / necessity of providing their families with
VV permanent homes and when they erected
memorials for the generations following to admire,
history the world over shows the kind of product
sought after. In the early stages it was customary
to carve temples and statutes from the rock hills.
The ancient city of Petra, located about ninety miles
from Jerusalem, in Syria
was hewn out of stone in
this manner. Man's genius
for creating the beautiful
was written in stone by
the ancient builders.
Eternity was the aim of
the Egyptians.
A triumph of the use
of quarried stone is found
in the Pyramids. Blocks,
weighing over five hun-
dred tons apiece, perfect-
ly squared, polished, and
inscribed with hiero-
glyphics, have a charm
that is irresistable, though
the architecture is
solemn. In reviewing the
history of basic architec-
ture we see the use of
stone in the Parthenon at
Athens, the great temples,
ampitheaters, and monu-
mental pillars of the
Romans, the Cathedral of
Cologne and Notre Dame
of the Gothic period and
the St. Peter's in Rome,
St. Paul's in London and
the Louvre in France of the Renaissance style.
The cut stone industry of today represents the
development of one of the country's richest natural
resources. From ocean to ocean and from the gulf
to the ice-bound extremes of the north, this conti-
nent is blessed with an abundance of fine building
stone, ranging from the many varieties of marble
and granite, rich in color and exquisite in texture,
to the unsurpassed limestone deposits, ideally
adapted to structural requirements.
There is a physical side of the subject that is in-
teresting. How and when the deposits were formed
is, of course, a matter of wide speculation. Scient-
ists agree that for aeons of time the entire limestone
EXPERT STONECUTTERS CHISEL OUT ALL

CRAFTSMANSHIP OF PAST AGES
districts were the shores of a vast ocean. For ages
the stormy sea currents lashed onto these shores bil-
lions upon billions of minute shell-bearing animals
and other marine substances, known as oolites. The
formation expanded, hardened, petrified, and finally
became largely uniform in substance and color as
it is found today. The stone consists of wholly
these shells cemented together with a film of simi-
_ larly pure carbonate of
lime. From this forma-
tion the words oolitic
limestone are derived.
In testing and choosing
a limestone deposit for
building purposes the first
consideration is the ex-
tent of its availability.
As an illustration take a
building and site costing
$10,000,000.00. If the
completion were delayed
only three months over
the expected time the
gross revenue loss at 15%
would be $373,000.00.
The loss in many cases
exceeds the cost of the
stonework. This means
that regardless of the
size of the project the
user can be assured of no
delay as far as the sup-
ply of the material is
concerned either at the
quarry or at the job.
There are many quarries
the United States.
n
Outstanding among the
quarries of the world are those in the oolitic lime-
stone district of southern Indiana. There the
geologists and mathematicians see a solid sheet of
stone forty miles long, five miles wide and seventy
feet thick, which is equivalent to eighteen billion
tons. Fancy a single freight train two hundred and
fifty miles long, a train with thirty thousand cars.
This train, loaded to the last car, would represent
the building stone drawn from the district in one
year, and yet the district's surface has hardly been
scratched. In 1929, according to government re-
ports the Indiana limestone district supplied 65.9%
of all architectural building stone.
Another feature is the strength of the stone. The


Page Eleven
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
average crushing strength of Indiana Limestone is
about 6500 pounds. The solid masonry shaft of the
Washington Monument, 555 feet high, puts a pres-
sure on its foundation of only about 313 pounds per
sq. in.; and the stone piers of the Brooklyn bridge
exert a pressure of but 396 pounds per sq. in. on
their bases. It is thus seen that limestone can sup-
port very much more than any load likely to put on
it. Also, the material must withstand extreme con-
ditions of atmospheric exposure. As it is a product
that is chosen to face and trim the exterior of the
building, permanency and protection against ex-
tremes in temperature assure the safety of the in-
vestment. Besides its strength and permanency the
stone must have an easy-working quality and yield
itself to the mechanical miracles, invented by labor
saving genius. The final feature that proves its
success is the appearance of color. Walls of light
colored Indiana Limestone are warm, cheerful, and
pleasing to the eye, while walls of brown or dark-
red stone impart an appearance of gloom. The most
popular colors are the different shades of buff, gray
and variegated. It is this variation in colors that is
sought by the designer.
Modern quarry operations use machines of iron,
steam, steel and electricity that drive all before
them. In the famous Indiana limestone district,
machines do the work from the very first operation,
which is stripping the top earth. Hydraulic strip-
ping has replaced the former slow, cumbersome
method that added so greatly to costs. Powerful

streams of water are forced through specially con-
structed pumping stations. Under the terrific pres-
sure the top earth is whipped off and swept away
like autumn leaves before a gale. Refuse rock, that
layer between the top soil and the age-old stone used
for building, is then removed by simple process.
The entire ledge is pierced with small holes about
three feet apart. Explosives are placed in these
holes with a thin copper wire leading from a central
charging station. At the signal an entire section of
the debris is torn loose. The waste rock is removed
by steam shovels.
It is then that the marvelous channelling ma-
SLABS OF STONE ARE CUT IN WHOLESALE QUAN-
TITES BY A MULTIPLE SAW WHICH SLICES

chines are set to work. On one side of the engine
is a gang of steel chisels. As the machine moves
back and forth upon a temporary track topping the
ledge, the chisels cut channels in the stone about
two inches wide and to a depth of about ten feet.
A great block is then ready to be turned over and
split to mill proportions. Huge derricks stretching
their gaunt, naked arms skyward pull the dimen-
sioned blocks out of the quarry. Heavily laden
trains crawl slowly through the hills to the stack-
ing yards for storage and seasoning. In these
stacks are found the different colors and textures
used by the architect for all building purposes.
Cut stone demands spring from the office of the
architect. There are between six and seven thou-
sand architects in the United States. These arch-
itects are producing between seven and eight bil-
lion dollars of new construction each year. It is the
architect that the cut stone plant must satisfy with
reference to quality, appearance and workmanship.
It is a highly technical industry. After receipt of
the general plans and all necessary information
trained draftsmen prepare shop drawings which
show the size and number of all the different pieces
in the building. From these a shop ticket is made
for each stone describing how it is to be fabricated
and finished. Accompanying the tickets are the
necessary patterns, moulds and models for the more
intricate pieces. The manager of the cut stone mill
receives the shop tickets. A ticket follows each
piece of stone through its entire operation.

THE life of a man of the Goodhue calibre and
the Goodhue accomplishments is most ex-
ceedingly difficult to picture. He was super-
normal in every sense of the world—professionally,
publically, and personally. He lived and worked
much like any other human yet the heights he at-
tained through living and working as he did is com-
parable to none. A dominating personality—
sparkling and vivacious; boundless energy, in-
exorable to his last hours; and divine genius, such
as architecture has seldom

Bertram G r o s v e n o r
Goodhue dreamt away his
youth in sketching, paint-
ing and avoiding school.
He passed into manhood
and into the profession
totally unprepared from a
scholastic point of view
yet he carried with him
the most precious asset
available—an artistic soul.
Once having become en-
gaged in architectural
work he felt the necessity
for a more comprehensive,
material knowledge of the
arts. His reading was stu-
pendous. Book after book
in endless file was care-
fully perused and gleaned
of all its worth until, at his
death, he had assimilated
an education far superior
to that from even the bet-
ter universities. He
moulded onto his art talent
an art tool with which he might fashion abstract
genius into firm reality.
His success as a self-educator was complete. It
served him as a life-long argument against the aca-
demic policies of the technical school. He main-
tained that an organism as delicately constituted and
as perfectly proportioned as was the architectural
mind need must be diplomatically developed along
paths of natural and spontaneous effort rather than
by methods of forced pedantry. He navigated many
BERTRAM GROSVEXOR GOODHUE
impoverished and subsequently disappointed drafts-
man into a course of self-betterment paralleling his
own.
His experience in early years was gained through
contacts with several Boston firms, until, in his
thirty-fifth year, he joined in partnership with Cram
and Wentworth, architects already very prominent.
Here he showed first evidences of that innate en-
dowment that makes him greatest of modern Amer-
ican architects. He seemed to sense a building as a
living entity, pulsing and
breathing in its every de-
tail—and detail—crisp, vig-
orous, and impeccable de-
tail—how he gloried in it!
He soon mastered the in-
tricacies of Gothic orna-
ment, burying himself
within it almost entirely
during his early stage of
development. This is at-
tributed to his association
with Ralph Adams Cram,
that able planner, who as-
sumed the bulk of the re-
sponsibility for general
plan and working of the
buildings while Goodhue
handled the ornamentation
and the allied arts.
In later years, when the
firm had changed its no-
menclature to Cram, Good-
hue, and Ferguson, a New
York office was opened and
Goodhue was put in charge
of its operation. Here he
drifted away from the in-
fluences of his senior asso-
ciates and began the origi-
nal development by which we know him. Responsi-
bility for the design of entire buildings was then
cast upon his shoulders, resulting in the play of an
uncanny ability at planning. The Gothicizm that
was Cram's and that Goodhue had come to worship
and to master now passed through the mill of his
original creative powers, discarding its time-worn
cloak of archeological exactitude and assuming a
new lease of life and meaning. The West Point

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
CHRCMATIC ARCHITECTURE
BY WALTER J.
IT is a curious fact that architecture from the
time of Inigo Jones, who transmitted the mono-
tone architecture of Palladio to England and
thence to America, has been an incomplete and an
unnatural art expression. Man has ever shown an
innate predilection for color and has always evi-
denced pleasure in its use. Until the time of
Palladio, color, as an im-
portant medium of decora-
tive expression in architec-
tural design, was recog-
nized and employed in greater
or less degree throughout all
the important periods in
which great styles of archi-
tecture were developed. In
America, color has never
played a significant role in
architecture; it has, in fact,
been relegated so minor a
part that it has now almost
disappeared. In view of the
promising possibilities of de-
veloping a truly great modern
American style, perhaps this
has been well, for its neglect
has allowed designers to de-
vote greater attention to an
understanding of form which
must fundamentally form the
basis of all good architecture.
Judging by the portent of
signs, it seems apparent that
such an unnatural condition
of a colorless architecture, in
which the achievement of
beauty would appear to de-
pend largely upon form alone, is on the threshold
of a renewed conception of art based on the premise
that form and color are insolubly linked together
and that the one may not only aid in expressing the
other, but that both may far better achieve that
elusive quality called beauty than could one of them
possibly do alone.
Present day American architecture is in a great
transition period in which the most obvious phe-
nomenon seems to be a startling emancipation from
traditional conceptions of the past to new experi-
mental tendencies in tune with the discoveries of
new materials and methods of treating them. It is
noteworthy that in the production of these new ma-
terials, and an increased variety of old ones, manu-

facturers, through their research laboratories, are
providing the architectural profession with a build-
ing materials color palette practically limitless in
its potentialities. The hesitancy of designers to em-
ploy significant color on important buildings can no
longer be explained by the existence of a fear that
any particular design in which color does play an
prominent part would be un-
realizable because of a lack
of available and appropriate
building materials. Any real
limitations which may exist
are rather a lack of sufficient
American precedent to pro-
vide those designers who do
have color imagination suffi-
cient courage to experiment
in a medium with which
they have had but little
actual working experience
and in which, consequently,
they feel ill at ease. Here
and there, however, may be
found a few with such cour-
age who, through their pio-
neer work in the color me-
dium, are paving the way to
i promise, at least, of better
things to come. Their efforts
indicate that our monotone
architecture, as a tradition, is
gradually giving way to an
American architecture in
which color is to play an in-
creasingly important role.
In our present day newly-
awakened interest in chro-
matic architecture, and for want of immediate
precedent, the natural impulse would be to go back
to those more distant architectural periods in which
color added glory to the structures it clothes, and
probably much of an inspirational nature might be
gained from such a study; but, if there is to be sin-
cerity and an achievement of enduring beauty in
our use of color it must be evolved out of those
new forms and materials in which our modern
modes of construction are being expressed, just as
those new forms themselves have been and are be-
ing evolved, and not by a prolonged and agonizing
process of attempting to adjust the color schemes

history as monuments because they solved prin-
ciples which made possible later masterpieces. The
Eastern-Columbia Building, an interesting and sat-
icfactory modern design, is not a tremendously im-
portant structure in itself as an expression of pure
form; but as a successful and purely modern ex-
periment in the use of color as the most distinctive
feature of its design, it stands out among other at-
tempts of the past few years as a veritable mile-
stone along the road to a solution of the color
problem as it applies to the architecture of the time
in which we live. As such it is of far-reaching sig-
nificance for those with ability to read its message.
Claude Beelman, the architect, obviously intended
that color would dominate and give distinction, as
well as superlative importance, to a building on a
north-west corner site which had to be designed
within the narrow confines of the City's one hun-
dred-fifty foot height-limit law, and at the same
time seems to have borne in mind the inherent dan-
ger of a monumental building so conceived and
actually constructed in close association with
neighboring buildings of less colorful tone. That
Mr. Beelman used just the right amount of re-
straint to that end and at the same time achieved
his original conception is a testimonial to his fine
artistry and good taste in an unusually difficult and
daring problem. The color scheme is really quite
simple in itself, yet breath-taking in its attainment
of sheer beauty. It consists of only three very care-
fully considered color tones: main body color of
pure turquoise blue in middle value and slightly
neutralized, sparingly used modelled trim in violet
of a slightly darker value and also somewhat
grayed, and a smaller amount of more richly model-
led and effectively distributed ornament used for
accent and contrast done in pure burnished dull
gold. All three tones, including the gold which is
produced by a perfected process, are in terra cotta.
The turquoise blue blocks that cover the greater
portion of the building are surfaced modelled with
small vertical grooves paralleling each other at
close intervals, while the decorative members in
violet and gold are treated in a coarse granular
effect. To this well considered surface treatment of
the material may be largely ascribed the success of
so bold a use of pure color and to creating the im-
pression that the color is an integrad quality of the
material itself rather than an artificial surface glaze
run monotonously over the blocks an effect so often
displeasingly apparent in colored terra cotta. The
high lights of the arrises and the shadows of the
fluted hollows, playing vertically over the surfaces
of walls and projections, and a similar play of in-
numerable small lights and shadows, but less ap-
parent in direction, on the decorative members,
serve as a common harmonizing element to bring
the three color tones together, producing an ap-
parent depth in the color themselves, and also di-
minishing their intensities with a richly softened
though not weakened effect. The total result is
one in which the architectural forms employed are
revealed and glorified through the effective and ap-
propriate use of beautiful color which seems not to
be skin deep but to permeate the entire structure
in a most satisfying way. The daring and courage
which brought it forth are worthy of emulation.
That it has aroused the not-to-be-mistaken interest
and pleasureable admiration of a public whose
pathy toward architecture—perhaps because it
has been monotone—is too well known to need
comment, indicates that its example will undoubt-
edly be followed. It is only to be hoped that it
may not bring forth a wild orgy of color pyro-
technics in architecture for dramatic advertising
purposes, but as a stepping stone to the threshold of
a sane and beautiful modern American chromatic
architecture.

Military Academy illustrates the transitional stage
in his development, his severance from the Cram
influence; while the Nebraska State Capitol ex-
presses the ultimate in his career.
Shortly after the West Point Commission, dis-
sention sprang up among the members of the firm
and Goodhue graciously withdrew to establish a
practice under his own name. Now he had af-
fected a complete independence from the style of
his associates, permitting his own reasoning powers
and his evolutive sense to be his only dictators. He
turned his attention toward the study of a style, or
rather, a manner, in the terminology of the mod-
erns, which he dubbed "God-knows-what-kind-of-
Classic" and many of his later and better attempts
were executed in this type. The Los Angeles Pub-
lic Library, the proposed Kansas City Memorial, the
Nebraska Capitol—all favored this unique mode of
Goodhue expression. Although borrowing a trace

ARCHITECTURAL MCDELS
BY JAMES RUSSELL BAILEY, 32A
THERE are many good reasons for the use of
models in the study of architectural form.
There are, however, two main points that suf-
ficiently cover the field of their usefulness. First,
it is very obvious to anyone who has ever tried
to work in third dimensions that the best way to
get good perception of values, of
mass and shadow, of outline and
projection, of approach and en-
vironment, is to study the problem
at small scale. All of this may
be advantageously attained by the
use of the medium of scaled model
delineation. The se'cond point of
view is taken from a business out-
look and again it is only natural
that a client would much rather
see his building as it" actually built
than to look at a clever architec-
tural rendering that may or may
not mean anything to him. By
way of a side-light, it may be well
to observe that an architect, as an
artist, is at a greater advantage
when he is able to create his work
and then see it, than when he
must see his abstract idea, hoping
to later create the work.
Architects for hundreds of
years have studied with models.
It is an interesting fact to note
that even in model building the
materials used express the culture
of the period. The Greeks and
Romans built models of wood,
fashioned in the true spirit of
their art. Later, Bramante and
other great, Renaissance archi-
tects built intricate plaster models
and presented them for judgment in their big com-

to be expressed. A detailed presentation of an in-
terior is a good example of their use. The principal
material used is mounted water-color board. This
affords the possibility of careful rendering. The tools
can be purchased or made at any man's workbench.
A good strong knife with a sharp point is the first
useful tool. This is used to make
a preliminary cut in the board.
The object of this being to make
a surface line on which to cut
with a razor blade. As the razor
blade is too flexible to cut accur-
ately it must be drawn carefully
across the preliminary cut several
times until the board is complete-
ly severed. A razor blade screwed
into a chisel handle makes an
excellent cutting tool.
In forming the body of a model
it is best to make the four walls
from a single piece of cardboard.
By cutting V-shaped grooves in
the back of the card it can be bent
to form the corners of the build-
ing. Before bending the corners,
it is necessary to score the surface
of the paper slightly with a knife.
This makes a sharp corner that is
free from curves. On the inside
there should be glued, back to
back, some of the same kind of
board, this serving as a protec-
tion against warped surfaces an 1
acts to stiffen the structure. Tne
principle of cutting of all shapes
is the same throughout the re-
mainder of the model.
Gluing is a complicated trick
and the key word in the proced-
ure is neatness and caution. Keep
a bowl of water and a towel handy in order that the
petitions. Today models are being constructed of tools and hands may be kept free from glue. Use
many materials—cardboard, soap, plaster, clay and fish glue and apply pressure when possible. Any
metal—representing an art and science that not
only reflects our culture but rivals many other
mediums in genuinely effective results. Cardboard,
clay and plaster models arc the most generally used
types, and it is these that this discourse shall be
chiefly concerned.
Cardboard models are first of all most advantage-
accidents with the glue are apt to spoil the render-
ing.
The rendering should be hard and sharp so that
it will compose properly—and it must be consid-
erably simplified. Bits of entourage are helpful.
Small scale automobiles and grass help to give the
model a natural setting. The trees can be made of
ously used when careful details are to be shown in pieces of rubber sponges and wire, being painted to
color and when the working parts of a building are

The Architectural Editorial Program
With this first issue, the Architectural Number,
The Technic inaugurates a new change in its
architectural policy. Up to the preceding year, no
definite program in the publication had adequately
represented the College of Architecture. Articles
found themselves scattered in the midst of
technical subjects and engineering news. This
custom was undoubtedly justified by the lack of
relative importance of the Architectural School, but
now, due to the occupation of the new building and
the influence of a well-trained faculty, the enroll-
ment has increased to the point where the former
degree of architectural representation is insufficient
and unfair.
Consequently, last year, first steps were taken
to organize a regular architectural section. This
end was attained and, in addition, a complete archi-
tectural number was published. The present year
sees a renewal of this scheme but with certain
changes in editorial policy which, the staff feels,
will improve the magazine from a literary point of
view and at the same time make it of real profession-
al advantage to the student. Several prominent men
in architectural practice, as George D. Mason, Irv-
ing K. Pond, Francis Keally, Wirt Roland, Glenn
R. Snyder, and W. S. Wolfe, have submitted arti-
cles which will be printed in the monthly archi-
tects' section. The faculty of the school has also
offered to contribute while the students plan their
usual number of amateur writings.
The introduction of the professional element
opens a new path to editorial development which, it
is hoped, will provide the architectural student with
something of the practical note now missing from
the academic curriculum.
The University and the Profession Speak of
Residences
A very prominent member of the faculty of the
College of Architecture recently went to exhaustible
length to vindicate its antagonistic attitude toward
residential design. He states that there is no place in
the four-year program for a detailed or even a general
consideration of the problem. The study of larger,
more ambitious, and imaginative projects absorbs the
time of the student to better advantage. This policy
has long been questioned from both within and without
the University, attracting a generous measure of at-
tention from the architectural profession and from the
building industry in general. Students realizing their
opinions distorted and unreliable heretofore have de-
clined to take a vigorous stand. But now the profes-
sional world speaks.
Two eminent Detroit architects, interviewed by the
"Technic" this summer, vociferously attacked the
school for its neglect of the housing problem. One says,
"Residences are not the profession's largest commis-
sions but by far its most numerous, yet we find few
college men reasonably capable of handling their design
or even their construction."
The other more specifically criticizes the University
by stating that "the faculty has contemptuously ignored
the small house as a subject below its plan of endeavor
and unworthy of its genius, inflicting upon the student
a similar attitude which often proves unprofitable,
financially and professionally."
The more authentic opinions are doubtlessly those of
the practitioners, tried by experience and customed by
the home-owner himself. They more thoroughly realize
the comparative advantage of the man trained to assume
the normal duties of the professional world over the
man trained, as Shelley wrote, "to soar the glorious
heights on wings of fancy and sprite imaginings." They
prefer, and rightly too, the practical to the practical))-
—the useful to the theoretical.

The Frontispiece
This month the frontispiece is a very excellent
pencil study by C. Wayne Mead, 3lA, made on a
summer sketching tour throughout the Eastern
States. It pictures a street in Marblehead, Massa-
chusetts, a quaint town which, as few others, is yet
free from the deluge of modern commercial enter-
prise. The sketch is one of a number of equally
good studies which will soon be put on exhibition
in Ann Arbor. Mr. Mead's activity in artistic fields
has extended to the use of water colors, pen and
ink, and etching. He has particularly excelled in
the latter medium.
The City Planning Convention
Last June the annual City Planning Convention was
held in Denver, Colorado with a very large representa-
tive body of City Planners and professional men and
women of allied interests in attendance. Here were
gathered the very best, the most distinguished technical
and scientific men in the country to demonstrate and
discuss the results of their experience and discoveries
in this very vital problem which is confronting every
growing and progressive city of today.—namely, the
planning or re-planning of the Modern City to meet the
needs of 2Oth century conditions. The convention was
presided over by Edward M. Bassett of Denver who
had secured for his speakers men who have attained
distinction in all phases of city planning other than
professional City Planners—engineers, landscape archi-
tects, lawyers, public officials, and architects. Notable
among these men were the two eminent City Planning
Consultants—Robert Whitten and Jacob L. Crane of
New York and Chicago respectively; Robert Kinger,
General Manager of the Chicago Regional Planning
Association; Major Gilmore D. Clark, Park Commis-
sioner of New York City; Major Carey H. Brown of
the Civic Improvement Association of Rochester, N. Y.;
and John Nolen, City Planner, Cambridge, Mass. The
problems discussed were of acute interest to all who are
acquainted with the major problems that Regional
planning and zoning boards, as well as all civic improve-
ment councils have to meet in carrying out their respec-
tive programs. Some of those problems discussed
were: "The Regulation of Subdivisions in Unincor-
porated Areas"; "The Better Use of the City Street,"
in which the loading and parking problems were em-
phasized; "Modern Motor Arteries", in which their
relation to minor streets, parks, and public buildings
were discussed, as well as their primary use as limbs
of the great transportation network; "The Acquisition
of Land" treated from the preliminary problem of
acquiring it to the question of using it to its best ad-
vantage, "The Administration of Zoning Ordinances'';
"Recreational Planning in Western Cities"; "Airports
and the City Plan", in which the results of The Aero-
nautical Engineering Research of Harvard University
were expounded.
But the Conference was more than a series of meet-
ings, discussions, and banquets. The City of Denver,
host to the convention stood as a living example of what
a truly progressive city interested in Civic Improvement
can accomplish. The results of which were shown to
the delegates in two very thorough motor trips in and
around the city.
Denver, of course, is very fortunate in her splendid
location among some of the finest natural scenery of
which the United States can boast. Situated as it is
in a region of remarkable climate nestled in among
the high peaks of the Rockies—notably Mt. Evans
which attains the very dignified elevation of 14,259 feet
above sea level; in a region abundant with cold spark-
ling rock bound mountain lakes, and flower laden
mountain meadows, and surrounded by the great,
somber, green masses of virgin timber of the National
Forest Preserve. Denver was quick to realize the value
of her natural heritage and has instituted a very com-
plete system of parks and parkways both in and far
outside the limits of the city. This development is
called the "Denver Mountain Park System", a system
which links all the city parks with the remote mountain
parks far up the sides of Mt. Evans in a network of
very modern highway parkways, and made all the more
complete by reason of the co-operation of the National
Forest Service in allowing the use of the National
Mountain Preserves and primitive territories to com-
plete the connection and enhance the beauty and
grandeur of this collossal park system which aggregates
a total of 12,000 acres. It has been Denver's idea to
relieve any congestion in the city parks, of which there
are many, and to send her great picnic and tourist
crowds up into the mountains where the sheer natural
beauty and grandness of scale cannot be surpassed,
where there is room for all within a few hours driving
distance. At the time the delegates at the convention
visited these parks, Summit Lake, which is just below
the highest point of Mt. Evans was over three quar-
ters enclosed in ice.
But Denver has more than her Park system of which
to be proud. A civic center is in progress which will be
modern in every detail from the great boulevard con-
nections which are being cut through the residence and
factory districts at a tremendous cost, to the beauty of
its design and increased utilitarian value achieved by its
arrangement.
A Recreation system makes a playground for young
and old readily available to all residents of the city,
large plots of grounds in every district having been
reserved and equipped for this use.
All in all, the city of Denver proved to be a wonder-
ful object lesson to the City Planning Convention. The
abstract and technical problems were discussed to their
fullest extent at the meetings, the city in which the con-

Dean Mortimer E. Cooley—
As I vision the future, the engineering profession
must inevitably take upon itself more and more of
the responsibility of management of the affairs of
our country, which has come into its position of
major influence among the nations almost wholly
because of its achievements in engineering. That
engineers are aware of this fact is evidenced by the
broadening scope of their activities in less technical
fields than those which have for fifty years absorbed
most of their interests and attention. What the
world needs today is the habit of straight and hon-
est thinking from cause to effect. That, perhaps, is
the engineers most valuable attribute.

Will Grigg's sudden death during the past
summer was a disturbing and poignant loss to
those of us who were his friends at the Univer-
sity of Michigan. His cheerful disposition and
his friendliness made of him a fine companion,
while his intelligent capacity for knowledge,
coupled with his industry, produced one of the
best students in our engineering school. His
scholastic record was one to be justly proud of
and he has set a precedent that will be difficult
to follow.
Will entered the university as a freshman in
the fall of 1927 and soon distinguished himself
by winning entrance to Phi Eta Sigma, fresh-
man honorary society. This scholastic victory
was but a stepping stone to future heights and,
as a result of his following years work, he was
admitted to Tau Beta Pi in the spring of 1930.
A Donovan Scholarship, created for self-sup-
porting engineering students, was recently
granted to him. His outside activities were
chiefly confined to The Michigan Technic

iency and was recently made Publication Edi-

little of these wonders, is it
strange that mere man, can

Yet are there men in the
world whose accomplishments
in combining practical engi-
neering with illusive art will
stand always as living testi-
monials of the thought and
skill that created them. Such
are the Architects, men trained
to see the practical as \vell as
the aesthetic, and to blend the
MR. WILLIAMS AND HIS TWO SONS
two into a perfect, beautiful, whole.
Michigan is a fruitful university as far as the
architect is concerned, for upon its beautiful cam-
pus may be found every type and style of archi-
tecture used in modern construction, (and some
not so modern). With such an environment, it is
not strange that the college of Architecture should
be noted for the achievements of the graduates to
uated from Central High school there, and was de-
sirous of wearing the little red and yellow button
to be seen upon the pots of architectural freshmen.
He further stated that he was named David Hamp-
son Williams, after his father, and was entering as a
special student. The youth was accepted, and went
about his studies earnestly,
earning for himself a bid to
Alpha Rho Chi. National Arch-
itectural Fraternity. In 1914,
Mr. Williams graduated, and
turned from study to the ap-
plication of what he had stud-
ied.
His first work was with the
George W. Groves Company,
of Detroit, Michigan. While
in this position, he was as-
signed to the work upon the
large Masonic Temple, erected
in Highland Park. Later we
find Mr. Williams working
with Robinson-Campau, Archi-
tects of Grand Rapids, Michi-
gan. After severing connec-
tions with this company, Mr.
Williams finally found his
native element in the George
D. Mason Company, with
which he has been affiliated ever since.
During the world war, Mr. Williams turned a
patriotic back upon his love for the profession, and
worked for some time with the Lincoln Motor Com-
pany, then entered the air service. His ground
school work was completed at Champaign, Illinois,
the location of the University of Illinois. His air
schooling was completed in Lone Oak, Arkansas,

Mason, in the capacity of Vice-President. Shortly
after the war, the project of the huge Masonic
Temple in Detroit, was announced, and The Mason
Company began work on the plans of one of the
finest buildings of its kind in the world. Mr. Wil-
liams had charge of drafting, layout and detail dur-
ing the construction, and can now point with pride
to the beautiful edifice that is partially the product
of his own mind. Another of Mr. Williams' out-
standing projects is the Young Men's Christian As-
sociation, of Highland Park, Michigan, which is
now being completed.
Work, Originality, and Personality won for him
the Annual award of the American Institute of
Architects, in nineteen twenty-nine, the award go-
ing to the Mason Company for its work on the Cen-
tral Woodward Christian church, in Detroit.
It is remembered that Mr. Williams was one of
the first to recommend that the College of Engi-
neering and architecture be made two separate and
distinct colleges, a step that has been only recently
taken, and one that seems to be functioning ad-
mirably. Mr. Williams still keeps his interest in
rtre University as a member of the Alumni Ad-
visory Committee of President Ruthven, represent-
ing the College of Architecture. He is also promi-
nent in the Inter-Collegiate Alumni Club.
Mr. Williams is married to Miss Madge Norton,
of Duluth, and has two sons, both of which will en-
ter Michigan someday, we'll wager. The eldest,
David, is eight, and John, despite his tender four
years, is said to be the youngest swimmer in the
Detroit Yacht Club.
Besides Alpha Rho Chi, Mr. Williams is a mem-
ber of Tau Sigma Delta, The Detroit Yacht Club,
the Cadillac Athletic Club, all Masonic bodies,
especially the Commandary, and the Inter-collegiate
Alumni Club.
Mr. Williams finds his most interesting hobby
to be boats, and things pertaining to boats. Per-
haps his old classmates will recall that it was he
who tried so hard to get a crew started at Michi-
gan, and that it was he who was instrumental in
starting a boat club in connection with the Union,
which had a short but happy career, dying out
shortly after the mind that conceived it left the
campus. Boats are still his great interest, and we
are afraid that Mrs. Williams is finding herself a
specie of yacht widow, for when the editor called,
he was at the yacht club, which he was instrumental
in designing. He is interested in sailing, canoeing,
outboard racing, canoe racing, ice boating, and in
fact, any sort of transportation by water, solid or
liquid.
Michigan points with pride to one of her sons who
has left the field of his youth and cleft for himself
a place in the Hall of Fame in a strange land. She
is proud to acknowledge the son to whom she gave
the first conception of constructive beauty, to be
well used in her name, and in the glory of the pro-
fession of architecture.

The Colleges of Engineering and Architecture
have made several additions to their faculties for

you a bit about the new men.
Edward Leerdrap Eriksen, new Professor of En-
gineering Mechanics, is of Danish origin and began
his education in a private school. He attended the
Gymnasium of Copenhagen, the public school in
Lindsay, Nebraska, and received his degree of
Bachelor of Civil Engineering at the Copenhagen
School of Polytechnic.
Mr. Eriksen has had a great deal of experience
in the civil engineering field and he has been em-
ployed as Junior Engineer at the waterworks of
Copenhagen. For a time he has served as drafts-
man for the Canadian Northern Railway and after
this he was employed as a designer for the Ca-
nadian Pacific Railway. While he was in the serv-
ice of the St. Lawrence Bridge Company, he helped
with the plans of the Quebec Bridge. In 1915 he
was made Instructor and later Assistant Professor
of Engineering Mechanics at the University of
Michigan. Purdue University has claimed him as
Professor of Structural Engineering for the past
few years and now he is returning to the old stamp-
ing grounds. Professor Eriksen is a member of the
Danish Engineering Society, the Michigan Engi-
neering Society, the Society for Promotion of En-
gineering Education, the U. of M. Faculty Club, and
is a life member of the Michigan Union.

When you start for the big game, from the time
you pull away from the cement curb until you
park your car at the concrete bowl, you are
never out of sight of cement.
Cement is the most widely used building mate-
rial in the world, because it is the lowest priced
high grade material obtainable.
The low price of cement has been made pos-
sible by mechanical handling. Every step of the

cement mills, Rex Conveyors and Elevators carry
the rock from quarry to car, from car to mill,

Professor Menefee's materials testing laboratory
is now the proud possesor of a new Telemeter and
a new 70,000 pound testing machine. The Tele-
meter is a strain testing machine, utilizing current
changes as an index of elongation or contraction in
stressed metal specimens. The old carbon pile type
of resistance is used in direct mechanical connection
with the test specimen so that increasing or de-
creasing pressure on the carbon discs decreases or
increases the resistance, which causes the current
changes on the recording apparatus. The meters
are calibrated, in terms of strain, proportional to
current. The Telemeter is one of the few readily
portable types of strain measuring machines and
it can be used for any conceivable type of work in
this line. An oscillograph and a camera are pro-
vided for recording permanent variations of read-
ing. The machine has been in possession of the
department for about a year but it was only dur-
ing the past summer that experimental work had
been done with it.
The Amsler testing machine is an imported ma-
chine of the hydraulic type. The instruments con-
nected with it are also hydraulically operated. This
method assures smooth operation and, as there are
several stress ranges to the gauge, very accurate
readings may be taken.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
WHAT SHALL I READ
(Continued from page 9)
for an insulting remark brought him to a trial be-
fore the House of Representatives under circum-
stances so dramatic as to thrill him back into some-
thing like his former magnetic self. He became
again the protege of Andrew Jackson and from that
moment conceived the grand enterprise to which he
devoted the rest of his life. He would capture an
empire and lay it at his old chieftain's feet.
The story of how Houston wrested the great
territory of Texas from Mexico,—the Alamo, St.
Hyacinth, St. Jacinto, and the rest,—how he cre-
ated the Republic of Texas, how he finally saved it
for the Union, his long losing fight against dis-
union, all the dramatic episodes of this great Man
of Destiny, read much more like fiction than fact.
And without exaggeration or resort to melodramatic
efforts, the author has made the most of his ma-
terial.
Thomas Masaryk of Czecho-Slovakia, to whom
in this year when he is celebrating his eightieth
birthday, the whole world is uniting to pay tribute,
is in most respects a striking contract to Sam Hous-
ton. The hero of San Jacinto was the product of a
rough, pioneer age of which fire-eating Andrew
Jackson and the fighting parson Peter Cartwright,
were the ideal expression. He was almost wholly
without schooling; except for his passion for pagan
poetry which led him to carry his Iliad into the wil-
derness with him, he was fashioned more by the life
of his Indian friends than by any of the conventional
influences of civilized life. He was without refine-
ment or culture; he was rough, violent in his tem-
pers and passions,—the almost perfect symbol of
the wild times in which he lived. Masaryk, on the
other hand, though he began life as the son of a
coachman in an obscure Moravian village, has risen
to his recognized place as leader of the whole
Czecho-Slovak people, largely because he has been
guided throughout by his philosophy and his ideals.
He is the fruit of the finest Kuropean culture; a
Doctor of Philosophy from the University of Vien-
na, a graduate student of Leipzig, lecturer in Phi-
losophy at Vienna, at the University of Prague, the
University of Chicago, King's College in London,—
the author of a number of books that have had
great influence on world politics.
In one respect only are he and Houston to be
compared. They were both empire builders. Each
created a state: the one by the swashbuckling meth-
ods of a buccaneer; the other by the unwavering
devotion to a philosophical ideal. It was this curi-
ous parallel in the careers of the two men that led
me to read the two biographies in relation to each
other.
Even as a lad in the Grammar School at Brno,
Masaryk had become conscious of Czech national-
ity. E-ven then he had the chivalrous dream which
became the obsession of his life to save the culture
of the Czech from final absorption by the German
culture that surrounded it. As he himself later
stated his purpose, "Not by violence, but by peace-
ful effort: not by the sword, but by the plough
share; not by blood, but by work: not by death, but
by life and the striving for life,—this is the reply of
the Czech genius, this is the lesson of our history
and the testament of our great ancestors." And so
with this inherited passion for freedom which had
inspired the Czechs of the sixteenth century,
Masaryk began to play his part in arousing the
sense of nationality which was to lift the Czechs and
Slovaks after nearly three hundred years of servi-
tude to the status of an independent nation.
To quote from Mr. Street's account: "He became
a national leader, as it were, by force of circum-
stances. In order to elevate the Czech people, it
was necessary to teach them patriotism, not the
form of patriotism which evinces itself in intrigue
but with a quiet and confident patroitism which
relies upon a sense of rectitude. Let the Czechs as
a nation revert to the virtues of their forefathers:
their destinies could then safely be trusted to look
after themselves".
"His political sense taught him that this place
could not be gained by force or through revolution.
The Czechs must first display a national conscious-
ness, and then their position would automatically
fall to them through a revolution of hearts and
heads. History taught that humanity founded upon
religion had been the characteristics of the Czechs
in the days of their prosperity, and a return to this
principle was the way in which a new salvation
must be found. The Czech Reformation had its
origin in a love of truth and of real Christianity,
and its success showed that these principles were in
accordance with the nature of the Czech people."
Mr. Street's account of Masaryk's long struggle
to realize his dream is interestingly told. From the
time when Masaryk entered the Austro-Hungarian
Parliament in 1890 as a member of the Young Czech
party till he returned from \Tew York in 1918 to
take his place at the head of the Czecho-Slovakian
Republic as its President, he was unwavering in his
purpose. He had to effect a political union of the
divided Czechs, to combat the imperial ruthlessness
and dishonesty of the Austrian Government, and
finally to guide the destinies of his people through
the complicated circumstances of the Great War.
Without even the credentials authorizing him to
speak for a united Czecho-Slovak nation he set out
on a world tour to preach his crusade and win the
support of the Allies. As Mr. Street says "He knew
that his cause was just, and that justice must,
sooner or later prevail with those before whom he
had to plead. And finally he had an implicit faith in


Page Thirty-Three
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the future, a faith as profound as that which in-
spired Moses to lead the chosen people to the Prom-
ised Land". His mission took him to Italy, to
Switzerland, to London, to Paris, to Russia, and
finally to Chicago, which next to Prague is the
largest Czech city in the world. The summer of
1918 saw his final triumph. The Allies and Asso-
ciated Powers recognized the independence of the
Czecho-Slovakian Nation. That was in August. In
November, a National Assembly proclaimed
Thomas Masaryk unanimously the President of a
free and Democratic Republic.
Some one has said—:"If ever a nation was the
work of one man, Czecho-Slovakia is that nation,
and Masaryk is the builder."

STONE THROUGH THE AGES
(Continued from page 11)
The modern cut stone plant is an interesting con-
trast with the plant of half a century back. In-
stead of scattered derricks, sheds and hand oper-
ated appliances the mill is a long, up to the minute
plant containing all the machinery for fabricating
the limestone ready for shipment. The spectator
marvels at the overhead traveling cranes, electrical-,
ly driven, that move and handle all of the stones.
The visitor is intrigued by the gang saws. They
produce slabs of different thicknesses from the large
blocks. The sawing is accomplished by the use of
water and sand, chat or steel shot, from an auto-
matic feed. The saw consists of a gang of blades
numbering from four to twenty or more. A popular
surface finish for plain ashlar is the gang sawed
finish. Ripple face and shot sawed are trade terms
describing the coarser finishes secured by sawing
with a heavier abrasive.
The operation of sawing stone has also been
speeded up by the diamond saw. This saw has a
circular blade of steel with steel teeth set in grooves
and fastened with a copper rivet. Into each tooth
from four to eight black diamonds are moulded.
These are true diamonds, but unlike the costly
jewels that grace dainty fingers they are not trans-
parent and consequently have no value as jewels,
but being the hardest substance known they can
actually cut through hard stone at the rate of about
a foot per minute.
Replacing the heavy handwork, planing machines
with their remarkable speed of forty-two feet a min-
ute are another industrial victory. Each one does
the work of about seven stone cutters with their
mallets and chisels. It faces all the stone for ashlar,
moulds the courses around the building and is in-
dispensable in the mill. With certain types of plan-
ers are machined the elaborate arches over en-
trances and windows.
No less revolutionary is the milling machine.
With amazing precision it covers tracery work,
dentils and sunken panels. Stone cutters also fash-
ioned balusters before the lathe with its accuracy
and speed made its bow. Today the machine,
speeding at one thousand revolutions a minute turns
out a finished baluster in fifteen minutes or one
twelfth of the time required by mallet and chisel.
The very essence of a beautiful column is in its im-
posing upward thrust, unbroken by joint or crevice.
The only limit to the size of a block from which a
column is turned is what a derrick and freight car
can carry.
Not all of the work is finished by machines. The
more intricate, elaborate and classical designs go
to the stone cutter and carver. Songs and stories,
woven about the stone cutters, have drifted down
through the ages. Around his work there has even
been an atmosphere of reverence. The stone cutters
of the Egyptian Pharoahs, the masons of classic
Greece and Rome, and the great builders of the
Gothic style and the Renaissance all left the in-
delible print of their personalities upon their work.
The old stone cutter with his mallet and chisel who
walked down the pages of history has now walked
off to obscurity. Mechanical miracles of stoneland
have increased his efficiency and have lowered pro-
duction costs. With the pneumatic air hammer and
its many different shaped chisels the artist-artisan
gives life to a block of stone.
History concedes to stone priority as a building
material. The modern architect turns to stone from
deliberate choice. It is the craftsmanship of one of
the greatest industries in the United States that
interprets in stone the architectural grandeur that
personifies the determined leadership of American
architects.

of inspiration from. Greek art, the manner is entire-
ly Goodhu-esque, possible of his, and only his, ac-
tive constructive mind.
Goodhue made a world of friends within his pro-
fession as without. Sculptors, painters, craftsmen
who worked with him gave every ounce of energy
to assist him in his ambitious projects because they
loved him as a man and as an artist and because
they needed his stimulating inspiration and guid-
ance. Lee Lawrie, world famous sculptor, worked
with Goodhue in brother-steadfastness. His work
appears on many of the better, more ornate ex-
amples and especially on the Nebraska Capitol
where he, like Goodhue, attained his zenith and
glorified his name to art.
He will always be remembered by his associates
as not only an outstanding genius but also as a real
man—a clean man—who loved his friends as he
loved his work—who would give his last breath to
further either—that was Goodhue. And now, six
years after his death, comes news of the successful
completion of his Nebraska enterprise, a great at-
tainment, embodying in immortality the principles,
the ethics, and the supreme genius that were Good-
hue's.

123,000 tests a year
In the Crane testing laboratories, the weight arm
of a specially designed machine measures the
steadily increasing load suspended from a small
cylinder of metal. Watching it intently is a man
who has at his command instruments that meas-
ure to .00005 °fan inch. The cylinder begins to
yield; he notes the weight. It snaps; he notes the
weight. Disengaging it, he measures the stretch
and diameter at the breaking point. These tests
form a part of the 123,000 determinations Crane
Co. makes on its own materials every year.
63,000 of the tests are chemical; not one compo-
nent from pig iron to limestone flux is charged in
a Crane melting furnace whose suitability has not
been determined by analysis. 60,000 are physical;
not one hour's melt is drawn ofFin a Crane foundry
whose physical properties — tensile, transverse,
and torsional strength, yield point,breaking point,
elongation, and reduction of area are not known.
By such exhaustive tests and by researches of
scientists in Crane laboratories, a vast body of
authoritative data on metals and their properties
has been collected. It is embodied in a book,
"Pioneering in Science", which is an invaluable
reference book for students. On request we will
send it to you.

Naval Aviation
The naval aviation course has gotten under way
and it shows much promise of being especially in-
teresting this year, as several new features have
been added.
More intense study of fewer subjects is the aim
of the naval instructors, and less attention will be
devoted to naval tactics and operations. The course
will consist of elementary aerodynamics taught by
Mr. Burke, aerial navigation, airplane construction
and equipment, naval regulations, some radio work,
and aircraft engines. Professor Lay will give the
lectures on engines and, as he is a recognized au-
thority on this type of work, his part of the course
is exceedingly instructive and interesting. Physical
examinations will be given early during the period
so as to allow slightly deficient students to get in
condition for the final physical check at the end of
the term. Moving pictures of naval flying oper-
ations will be shown from time to time; this should
tend to liven up the course as it will give a vivid
picture of the type of flying to be expected by the
embryo aviators.
Very little technical knowledge is required as a
prerequisite to the course and it is open to "lit"
students as well as to engineers.

ELECTRICITY TO YOU
IRESS a button —snap a switch—and modern industry moves
forward with electric power, light, and heat. When you tap electricity you are tapping
a force that surges through wire nerves from giant dams or huge turbines perhaps
hundreds and hundreds of miles away.
In all the important phases—generation, transmission, and distribution—electricity
depends on explosives.
Explosives blast dam foundations and help to drive miles of tunnels for hydroelectric projects; wrest from
the earth the metals and other materials used in millions of miles of wire and cables and in other
electrical equipment; and mine the coal that supplies energy which operates steam generators.
Not only in electricity but in almost limitless ways, explosives contribute daily to the comfort and
convenience of living. In these achievements, Hercules explosives have played, and will continue to
play, an important part.
As an engineer you should know more about explosives. Write for a sample copy of THE EXPLOSIVES

The electrical department has obtained the serv-
ices of Arlen R. Hellwarth as Instructor in Elec-
trical Engineering. Mr. Hellwarth has his B.S. from
the University of Michigan and, since his gradua-
tion in 1925, has been working with Western Elec-
tric and the Aluminum Co. of America. His work
has been chiefly associated with telegraphic and
telephonic transmission systems and he has had
valuable experience with the equipment used in
these fields. He is a member of the Western So-
ciety of Engineering and the American Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Science.
Colloquium in Applied Mechanics
The colloquium was organized to encourage tech-
nical discussion in the College of Engineering. The
organization was first set into motion some years
ago by W. M. Coates, formerly of the mathematics
department. Some interesting papers on various
technical subjects have been presented in the past;
most of these papers being given by faculty men.
Last year, however, some members of the student
body read several excellent papers.
Applied mechanics, being part of the foundation
of practically all branches of engineering, provides
a common ground for discussion for almost every
type of engineer. The programs for this year will
be interesting and varied in their scope. Some of
these will be given by:
F. Everett, of the engineering research depart-
ment
L. H. Donnell, of the engineering mechanics de-
partment.
A. A. Jakkula, civil engineering department.
D. H. Young, graduate.
W. O. Freyberg, engineering research depart-
ment.
The colloquim meets every alternate Thursday
evening and the engineering student is always wel-
come to participate. The papers are usually pre-
sented first, then an open discussion of the topic is
started. Every one present may enter the dis-
cussions.

SKYSCRAPERS
(Continued from page 8)
our cities became a conglomeration of elongated
boxes and ill-proportioned towers, marvelous feats
of engineering' skill, but lacking in their design, the
very basic principles on which architecture is
founded. With buildings striving to outdo one an-
other in height, the streets became canyon-like in
appearance, the sun finding its way there only for
an hour or two during the middle of the day, play-
ing havoc with business, the very thing which the
tall buildings were intended to aid most. From the
land valuation point of view, conditions improved,
which can be easily understood when it is realized
that three and four story buildings were replaced
by others twenty-three and twenty-four stories
high. But from an artistic point of view, an arch-
itectural viewpoint, they deserve little praise. The
remedy seemed to be in stabilizing in some way
these roaring masses of various shapes and sizes.
Such stabilizing could only come by law. No law-
could fix the shape or design of a building, but a
law can fix its height.
A zoning law for New York City, where the
skyscrapers had originated and developed, was sug-
gested and promptly enacted, by which a structure
is allowed to rise straight up from the street line
only to a height determined by the width of the
street upon which it faced. If the building is car-
ried beyond that height, it must, from that point
upward, slant backward, and must be kept within
a line drawn from the center of the street through
the top of the wall on the street or building line.
Different height allowances determined various
zones. The law' of zoning means that a pyramid be
superimposed on a cube. A pyramid is especially
unsuited for windows, for example, unless they be
dormers, so architects developed a series of set-
backs or terraces that, as they stepped backward
and upward, kept within the pyramidal line.
In certain other cities where a zoning law is en-
forced, as in Chicago, for example, the height
straightup from the building line is fixed at so many
feet and set-backs, also definitely established. There
is a provision in the New York zoning law that
upon twenty-five per cent of the aera of the plot
the building may be carried to an unlimited height.
This clause is responsible for the towers which
frequently surmound these structures.
It has taken us some years to learn that a style,
worthy to be so called, must come from the people.
An American style of architecture must bear the
marks of American nationalism, and not represent
only the ideas of a select few. Furthermore, a
style of architecture must be based on building ma-
terials and methods in vogue in the country where
the style originates. To overcome, then, the varia-
tion in climate, prevalent in the different localities
of this vast country, building materials and methods
of construction must be developed that will with-
stand the various climates, and at the same time
be as appropriate in one temperature as in another.
Or, designs must be originated that will adapt
themselves to the various materials and methods of
building in use in the various localities.
The modern skyscraper seems to have solved
these problems so far as the tall building is con-
cerned. Its mass, at least, is just as appropriate to
the structural qualifications of San Francisco, St.
Louis, Cleveland or Xew York. Its success is due
primarily to its natural development wherever it is
erected. Its mass and its ornamental details arise
naturally from its structural plan. In a building
designed in a pure style, materials and methods of
construction are never challenged. That is one of
the first principles on which the modern American
skyscraper is being developed.
ARCHITECTURAL MODELS
(Continued from page 15)
the desired colors. Grass can be represented by a
mixture of sand and powdered paint spread over
glue. Lolly-pop sticks can be made into small-
scale columns if shaped with fine sand paper. A
clever little tool to use in clamping on small parts
of cardboard is a wooden spring clothes pin.
Clay and plaster models are best used in the study
of the massing and composition of a building. Large
scale details may also be studied to advantage in
this medium. Plasteline is a material that is com-
monly used in preliminary studies. It is easily
worked, makes possible many changes, and can be
used many times for different subjects. It is also
worked to final scale to form a core from which a
cast for the plaster model is made. The model is in
turn carefully studied, photographed, and finally
used to give the actual scale dimensions for the
working drawings.
A clever device for handling the plasteline may
be described as a box built up to the desired scale
and outline of a facade. In this guiding box is
pressed a sufficient amount of the plastic material.
T-square and triangles with a steel point for a
pencil are employed to draw the outlines of the
windows, setbacks, and other features. Cutting
edges can be shaped in zinc plates and built to slide
along a track to model mouldings. The object of
guiding and cutting surfaces is one of accuracy as
well as of efficiency. In the case of buildings with
similar facades, it is simple to join these flat pieces
together to get quick results. A model of this type
can be built for study in a very few hours.

Ivory soap is a material that possesses an excel-
lent texture on which to carve intricate detail. It
takes color successfully and may be invaluable to
those who make garden models or other similar
types. The major fault of the soap in models is its
distortion due to shrinkage. The fault may be
largely overcome if the carver takes the trouble to
dry his model before he puts on the finishing
touches.
The trick in this medium is that of joining the
cakes of soap. First, cut away a thin layer of the
soap from all sides to form plane surfaces. Cover
the bottom of a large shallow pan with hot water
to a depth of about one half inch, place the pan
over a slow fire and into it put two cakes of soap
that are to be joined with the two bed-faces resting
in the pan. When the heat has softened the faces
of the soap to a semi-solid state, take one piece
from the pan, press into the softened side two sliv-
ers of wood or tooth picks; the cakes may then be
forced together, making a permanent joint. By re-
peating this process the desired mass is easily built
up.
An important point is not to start carving until
the soap has been joined for about five hours; the
rough blocking out may, however, be done after a
few minutes of drying.
Tempera color may be applied directly with a
brush. Grass can be made of melted soap and glue.
This mixture, in a liquid form, will adhere to a wire
armature shaped to form the structure of a tree,
producing very natural foliage.
Since the model is an exact replica of the finished
product it should represent the artist's conception of
the problem in hand. The substance of the art of
model building depends entirely upon the ability of
the artist to completely sense the desired effect and
to effectively execute it.

G-E Floodlighting Wins Favor for
Football - Hockey - Track - Baseball - Tennis
G-E floodlighting equipment has a winning record. Its victories are
counted in terms of pleased spectators, increased attendance, satisfied
coaches and players.
The development of G-E athletic-field floodlighting equipment was
planned with every consideration for the fundamental and special playing
conditions it must meet. That is why the big Novalux projectors give
ample and evenly diffused light over the entire playing area.
The development of General Electric floodlighting equipment has
largely been the work of college-trained men in the G-E organization

leadership of General Electric in furnishing the many other products
which bear the G-E monogram.

How the Department of Engineering Research
of the University of Michigan Serves
the Industries of the State
The Department of Engineering Re-
search of the University of Michigan is
designed to assist the industries of the
State in placing at their disposal the en-
tire scientific resources of the Univer-
sity.
It is not organized for the mere run-
ning of routine tests or the solution of
minor shop problems, but for the ex-
haustive study and investigation of
scientific manufacturing problems crit-
ical to the progress of forward look-
ing industries.
Through this Department the manu-
facturer may secure the service of
trained scientists, special laboratories,
library facilities and testing equipment
of exceptional sort, and the sustained
and thorough quality of research work
which is to be found in a great uni-
versity.
Under the present generous patent
arrangements, clients of the Depart-
ment may, by the payment of a some-
what higher service charge, secure the
benefits to be derived from all inven-
tions, patents and patenable processes
resulting from the investigations made
in their behalf.
All problems submitted to the De-
partment should be addressed to the
Director. Such problems will be care-
fully studied and only those will be
undertaken in which it is felt that the
Department may be of service to the
prospective client. The regular service
charge for such work is thirty per cent,
based on labor.

MODERN TRANSPORTATION
ROLLS ON TIMKENS
Swiftly... smoothly ... silently ... the modern train gathers speed or
slows to a stop without a jar or jerk. Looking for the reason, student
engineers find Timken—the same bearing that has licked the toughest
jobs throughout all Industry—the most powerful weapon available to
them in their future war against mechanical waste and inefficiency.
In railroad cars Timkens have justified their use and proved their
supremacy in one hundred million car miles of travel on one rail-
road alone.
And why not? For thirty years and more, Timken Bearings have
reigned supreme over friction; have carried not one type of load, but
all loads—radial and thrust—measured in pounds or thousands of tons.
In the air and on the water, by road and rail, Timken tapered construc-
tion and Timken-made steel roll on to new triumphs—saving power
and lubricant... promoting dependability ... assuring extreme econ-
omy of maintenance with supreme defiance of depreciation.
In train service they afford the luxury of smooth, silent travel, with
starting resistance reduced 88%.
One hundred and thirty-four railroads are now using or testing
Timken Bearings, so it does not seem a far cry to the time when
all transportation—passenger cars, freight cars, mine cars, motor

The Chicago World's Fair
A New Contribution to Architecture
lly RAYMOND M. HOOD, A. I. A.
DESIGNING world's fair buildings presents
for solution, problems entirely out of the
ordinary run. The cost of such structures
must be amortized in the short period during which
buildings have a useful life.
In the Exposition at Chicago in 1933, only one
of the buildings is permanent. This is the Adminis-
tration Building. All of the others must be built
with a view of immediate demolition and removal at
the close of the Fair.
These conditions demand a low initial cost, an
ease of demolition, and a relatively high salvage
value of materials used.
The more effective organization of shop labor has
direct bearing on all building projects. Economic
construction is most easy when light materials are
used and processed before delivery upon the
grounds. This facilitates an economical fabrication
of materials into finished structures.
Another factor arising from the temporary char-
acter of the buildings is that higher working stresses
in materials can be used than would be permitted
by the usual building code. Less durable mate-
rials and lighter sections can easily be used.
Buildings designed up to the present for the Ex-
position consist of steel frames with bolted con-
nections to permit easy demolition. Because of the
lighter materials which are used in all parts of the
structure, lighter steel frames have been used. Ex-
terior walls of the Administration Building, which

ERAL VIEW OF THE MAIN FACADE OF THE ADMINISTRATION BUILDING AT THE CHICAGO

is almost completed, are made of highly compressed
slabs of Portland cement and asbestos fibre. Slabs
are mounted on metal studs fastened to the steel
frames. The interior walls are gypsum board. The
space between these two walls is filled with an in-
sulating material shot in by air guns to prevent
heat radiation.
The Administration Building is the only one to
be equipped with heating facilities. Interior parti-
tions are of gypsum board mounted on metal studs.
Two fire walls of gypsum divide the building into
three sections. The building is three hundred and
forty feet in length in the form of an "E" with
wings extending back one hundred and fifty feet.
It is two, three and four stories in height. It con-
tains the offices of the world's fair staff, an exhibit
hall and pre-fair displays, and a large reception
room for the trustees of the Fair.
Floor levels in _______^^^^^__^^__
the wings of the
buildings are stag-

tween different de-
partments.
After careful
study of require-
ments and econom-
ics, gas was se-

Floor standards are plugged in to meet conditions
of organization.
This Administration Building of the new World's
Fair has, to the north of it and on the west, the
Greek lines of the Shedd Aquarium and the massive
Field Museum. To the southwest is the imposing
Soldier's Field, Chicago's memorial to her soldier
sons. The thoroughly modern lines of the Admin-
istration Building, especially on its western front,
complement the other architectural lines and fill
out a picture of symmetry and beauty.
The eastern front of the Administration Building,
facing the lagoon, is terraced two and three and four
stories. It is designed to supplement the lines of
buildings to be built adjacent to it within the ex-
position grounds.
The display theme of the new world's fair is to
tell the romance and drama of the development of
_^^^^^^^^___^^_^_____ science and all of
the scientific arts
during the century
in which Chicago
has grown from a
desolate and un-
promising site to

cause of the quick

ically controlled. Lighting of this building has sev-
eral interesting features.
Continuous factory type sash is used but each
alternate vertical muntin bar in standard factory
sash design has been omitted to improve appear-
ance and to facilitate washing the glass. Improved
methods of glass manufacture practically abolished
the former economy in the use of small sized panes.
Larger panes can now be used with more economy
than smaller ones.
Artificial illumination is by ceiling fixtures in the
corridors and trustees' room. The offices are il-
luminated by an inexpensive type of inverted re-
flector mounted on a portable floor standard. These
fixtures can be shifted easily to meet changes in
building industries.
It is planned to
make the buildings,
scientifically and
artistically, an in-
tegral part of the
exposition exhibits.
The buildings have taken entirely different form
from those of former expositions in the United
States. Architectural effects are obtained by ar-
rangement of masses and planes, rather than by use
of elaborate detail and ornate adornment.
From this use of the latest materials produced by
science, and by means of buildings which are arch-
itecturally satisfying in every way, it is hoped that
other efforts will come along the same lines, and
that all such efforts will redound to the benefit of
the building industries, and to the public who build
and utilize buildings of all kinds.
It may unite the arts which until this time have
been laboring diligently within the limited scope of
their field. It should fuse into one coherent mass
of work of these professions and produce an under-
office organization. High and low tension wiring standing that will be of greatest use to Industry,
for the offices is carried in a metal conduit base. Art and Education.

What Shall I Read?
Nobel Prize of 1928
By .1. RALEIGH NELSON, Professor of English
-V"* T-T^HEN the Nobel Prize for 1928 was an-
\V/ nounced as awarded to Sigrid Undset,
VV as the person who had produced in the
field of literature "the most distinguished work of
an idealistic tendency", I will admit the winner of
this distinguished honor was only a name to me,
but I remember the two great Norwegian novels by
Knut Hamsum, Hunger, and The Growth of the Soil,
which had previously received the Nobel Prize, and
waited somewhat impatiently for the English trans-
lation to make the new novels of mediaeval Norway
available. Now that I have read them not once,
but repeatedly, turning back over
some of the marvelous passages
which I have marked, I am quite
ready to agree with the enthus-
iastic judgment of one critic who
calls Kristin Lavransdatter "the
finest historical novel our twen-
tieth century has yet produced:
"indeed," he says, "it dwarfs most
of the fiction of any kind that Eu-
rope has produced in the last
twenty years." If I could claim to
be familiar with all the fiction Eu-
rope has produced in the past
twenty years my judgment would
carry more weight, but at least
nothing I have had in many years has so stirred
me as have these two great novels, Kristin Lavrans-
datter and The Master of Hestviken.
Kristin Lavransdatter is a trilogy—three novels in
a magnificent sequence, The Bridal Wreath, The Mis-
tress of Httsaby, and The Cross, which follow Kristin's
life from her childhood to her grave. It is a woman's
frank study of a woman's psychology under almost
every possible circumstance. It is the story of a
woman's steadfast, unfailing love for a fickle man.
The vast sweep of incident rising to breathless
climaxes is bound into a unity by the theme which
in a modified form runs also through The Mistress of
Husaby—the patient, unflinching endurance of the
fate which ones sin has laid upon him. "Ye must
wait in patience for the lot God may sent you," says
the beloved old priest to the sinning Kristin "and
make in your heart what amends you can." And she
moves through her experiences as a young wife and
mother, as the Mistress of Husaby, and meets her great

problems of lonliness and age in The Cross, with a pa-
tience and courage that is superb. The fatalism of
Madame Undset's books is a brooding, Norse mood,
gloomy and melancholy, but none the less awe-in-
spiring in its revelation of the courage of which the
human soul is capable.
The Master of Hestviken is a tetralogy. The four
novels tell the story of Olaf Audunsson, who lives
his life under the shadow of a sin for which he can
never made satisfactory retribution. Like Kristin,
Olaf acceptes the heart-breaking burden of remorse
his sin has laid upon him. He endures his fate with-
out question or complaint. The
theme is in a way the converse of
that in Kristin Lavransdatter, for
here it is the man who steadfastly
loves to the end a weak, fickle, but
wholly lovable woman. The Axe,
and The Snake Pit, the first two
members of the tetralogy, trace
Olaf's life from his innocent boy-
hood through his outlawry result-
ing from a murder, and his mar-
riage to Ingunn. The Wilderness
deals with his spiritual crisis,
when, thwarted in his efforts to
join a religious order, he finally
finds relief from his sense of guilt
in fighting for his country. The last volume. The
Son Avenger, presents the religious conflict in the
hearts of Olaf and his foster son Erick, and brings
the magnificent saga to an end.
It is difficult to ascribe the greatness of Madame
Undset's work to any one element in her novels,
for the plot, the underlying theme or motif, the
characters, so human, so passionate, so fallable,
and the rich and colorful detail of the sitting, are
all inseparably associated in producing a unity and
totality of effect that defies or at least does not
invite analysis. But there is one quality which her
novels have that no one can fail to note. Although
she is writing of Norway of the fourteenth cen-
tury, the reader has no sense of any sundering cen-
turies. The author has so completely mastered the
historical detail of the period she is depicting, she
has identified herself so completely with the life of
the period, its moral codes, the habits of thought of

The Pan-American Highways
By ROBERT A. WOLF, 31E
THE great achievements of the ages can us-
ually he accredited to the vision of dreamers,
outstanding men who have been moved by
the spirit of progress and who have molded their
plastic thoughts into real, workable, ideas for the
advancement of humanity. Whether America was
first discovered by Amerigo Vespucci or Christo-
pher Columbus is not the concern of this article,
but it is to these dreamers
that we owe the develop-
ment of the Americas.
Four hundred years have
passed since Hernando
Cortez set out from Cuba
with his eleven little ships
to conquer Mexico, the
forerunner of centuries of
strife and conquest of the
Spanish conquistadors.
The rampant cry was:
Gold!, Gold!.
Today there is another
army setting out to con-
quer the Central Ameri-
cas, an army of states-
men and engineers whose
banner is fraternity, un-
derstanding, and good
will. The search for
wealth is still going on,
for men have not changed
in a few centuries, but the
spoils will be distributed
among 19 nations and
vast natural resources, which have hitherto been
lying dormant because of lack of transportational
facilities, will be opened up. The economic bene-
fits of the project can be foreseen without difficulty
and it is hoped that the political results will be
comparable to them, as intermingling of nationali-
MAP
the Pan American Highway Commission suggested
that work be started on the project and at this time
engineers from the co-operating countries made a
trip through the United States to study roads and
highway construction methods in our country. The
delegates went back to their respective nations very
much enthused and since that time they have been
conducting surveys and improving their sectors of
the Gargantuan highway.
At the present time there
are gaps of about 2,000
miles of the 10,000 mile
stretch between Laredo,
Texas, to Puerto Monte,
Chile, where the route will
cross the Andes into Ar-
gentina. The conception,
that the Pan American
Highway is no more than
a dreamer's fancy, is er-
roneous because con-
struction is going on as
rapidly as possible under
the restricted conditions
and since the last Con-
gress of Pan American
Highways had its meet-
ing and has drawn up its
systematic method of pro-
cedure the work has been
rapidly accelerated. Most
of the distance has already
been covered by automo-
bile, but there are many
sections where the roads are still in the pack trail
stage. The highway, when completed, will be one of
outstanding monuments to organization and engi-
neering and will open up an immensely interesting
country to the American tourist. The route of the
.'highway in the United States is of no great im-

known forces toward the development of peace and
understanding between nations. The Pan American
Highway will provide opportunity for social inter-
course between these nations and in a few years it
will be possible to travel from Canada to the south-
ern part of Chile via this vast highway.
The idea of a Pan American Highway is not new,
as it was originated about a century ago, but noth-
ing definite had been done about it until 1924 when
'The terminal point, however, will be at Laredo,
Texas, from where the ribbon of friendship will
weave its way southward. From Laredo the high-
way will go down through Monterey and Valles to
Mexico City. The road is excellent along this sector
and many American tourists travel over it to see
the beauty and wonders of this country. At Mexico
City the road takes up the route and goes to Oaxaca
and San Cristobal, then to the northern boundary of

Guatemala at Suchiate; this part is now under con-
struction and will be complete in a very short time.
Guatemala has a reasonably good road building
program and there are passable roads from Ayutla
through Guatemala City and San Salvador to Mon-
goy on the frontier of Salvador. This is a very pic-
turesque part of the highway as the Sierra Madre
System traverses the Country from north to south
in three ranges and the route also passes through
the beautiful agricultural section. Most of the
roads here are of improved dirt which is graded and
rolled.
A comprehensive program of highway construc-
tion has already been approved by the Government
of Salvador and included in this program is a road
extending from the border of Guatemala to the
frontier of Honduras, which will comprise the Salva-
dorean link of the Pan American Highway. Work
on the Pacific coastal highway in Honduras has
been projected and there, as in most of the other
Central Americas, there are serious obstacles due to
the mountainous nature of the country, but there
are no obstacles which have not been solved by
engineers in some similar circumstances. Nica-
ragua is the next country through which we travel
and here we find desperados, bandits, captured
American capitalists, and controversies over the
Monroe Doctrine. The highway situation is much
better than the political situation although there is
no section of roadway from the Honduras boundary
to Matagalpa, where the road leads to Managua,

the capital city of Nicaragua. There is a dry
weather road from Managua to Rivas on the Costa
Rican border and from there another section must
be completely built through Sam Roman around
Lake Arenal to Cartago and then to the edge of
Panama.
The Panama link would extend from the south-
ern border of Costa Rica to the city of David. No
road is in existence here but the country is level and
there are no serious obstacles to the building of
roads. Ninety-five miles of paved road are now
under construction from David to Santiago and
the highway has been completed from there to

to the Republic of Panama is the most important
part of the highway, especially to our country, be-
cause of the projected canal across Nicaragua, rights
for which have been obtained by the Byron-Cha-
moro treaty. This section will be completed before
five years have passed and at the present time near-
ly the whole way can be made by auto if the incon-
veniences are overlooked.
With the dawn of a new era the great South
American continent looms upon the horizon of pop-
ular interest; and larger ships, shorter routes, and
more rapid transportation, is beginning to turn the
tide of travel toward the growing nations of the
southland. The new facilities which the highway
presents will undoubtedly draw a great many more
travelers from the countries lying north of this vast
continent. There is a great deal of friction be-
tween some of the nations here, as witnessed by the
Tacna-Arica situation, and other boundary dis-
putes are very frequent; it will be noticed from
the map that in very few cases do the countries at-
tempt to run their roads to the boundaries. A great
deal of this petty friction should be removed if the
peoples would get to understand each other more
thoroughly and view the matter in its international
aspects. This should be aided by the Pan Ameri-
can Highway which, in many places, needs only
the spanning of the boundaries and improvement of
the existing highways.
Each nation had been using different methods,
none of them being very efficient, and in most cases
the work was done without the aid of machines, the
heavy work was done with dynamite and the lighter

A STEAM turbine of the simplest type is essen-
tially a wheel similar to an ordinary water
wheel, which is moved around by a steam jet
impinging on its blades. Thus we see that the general
design is very simple. For the sake of economy the
steam is directed against the turbine wheel by nozzles
or similar passages delivering the steam at mathe-
matically exact angles, calculated to make it strike the
blades of the wheel most advantageously.
The steam turbine is the most ancient as well as
the most modern steam motor. Going back before the
days of Watt and Newcomen we find a reaction steam
turbine mentioned by the Egyptian Philosopher Hero,
in his book on "Pneumatics," which
was written about one hundred and
thirty years before Christ. This, ac-
cording to historical records, is the
birth of the idea or invention of steam
turbines. If any other idea did exist
before this date, it simply died with
the inventor. The steam turbine has
had a longer period of development
than any other prime mover. The rea-
son for this probably is: in general
design the steam turbine is the sim-
plest of the prime movers, but in tech-
nical data and detail it presents very
complicated problems.
If we look back into the history of
the steam turbine, we find that its en-
tire history can be divided into three
periods. The first period, which dates from 130 B.C.
to about 1570 A.D., is a period of seventeen hundred
years in which the idea of Hero's turbine existed only
on record without ever being appreciably improved,
developed or used. To have an idea live so long on
record without being improved or used seems rather
uncommon, because man has always attempted to
lighten his burdens by controlling other powers, such
as animals and machinery. According to this period in
history we may think that man was satisfied to do
his daily work by hand and with the aid of animals,
but we must remember that little mechanical develop-
ment could take place during this period, especially in
the earlier part, because the average man had little or
practically no chance of developing or trying out his
ideas in mechanical lines. Most people of that day
thought that a man tinkering with machinery or new
ideas was possessed with evil spirits; in many cases
they killed men who were about to contribute much
to the comfort and welfare of mankind.
The second period, which dates from 1570 to 1883,
HERO'S TURBINE
is a much shorter period than the first; the ideas
brought out and patents registered showed that man
was striving to harness some of the power in nature
and make it do useful work. The history of this
period shows that machines were built and used but
none was a commercial success. According to the
records of the past, the first man to use a steam tur-
bine to do work was a German mechanic who used
Hero's engine to rotate a broach in place of a turnspit.
This was in the year 1577, showing that the steam
turbine idea finally took root and began to grow.
Fifty years later an Italian architect named Branca
made a contribution to the development of the steam
turbine. His idea, as described, seems
to be the first practical description of
an impulse turbine, and in 1642 a man
named Kircher placed the first ma-
chine of this kind in operation. How-
ever, he used two jets or nozzles in-
stead of one as described in Branca's
plan.
In the year 1784 two patents were
granted, the first to Kempelen, on a
reaction engine, and the second was
granted to the famed inventor of the
reciprocating engine, James Watt. His
patent was on a liquid reaction tur-
bine which was interesting in design,
but did hot approach the design of
the steam turbine. •
The year 1843 saw the last, but
most important, contribution of this second period. It
is the first technical work and experimentation done for
the advancement of steam turbines, and was done by
a man named Pilbrow. When anything happened he
was always anxious to find the reason and all facts
that could be learned. It was this characteristic which
led him to his experiments. A technical description of
one of his experiments is given to show the nature
and importance of his work. He found that in a
nozzle having an orifice three-eighths of an inch in
diameter (the form of the nozzle was unfortunately
not stated), the impulsive force of the steam issuing
into the atmosphere was nearly proportional to the
gauge pressure. The pressures experimented with
varied from ten to sixty pounds per square inch, and
the best impulsive force was about three-quarters of
an inch from the orifice of the nozzle. Using sixty
pounds per square inch pressure he would get a velocity
of 1,250 feet per second, which he expected to use in
designing his turbine.

Prior to this time, most all the development of
steam turbines was only on general principles. The
operation of a machine may be explained just by gen-
eral principles, but to build a successful machine, tech-
nical data is required. Pilbrow's experiments undoubt-
edly had much to do in bringing about the last period
in the history of the steam turbine, because they were
the beginning of the search for technical information.
The last or third period in the history of the steam
turbine is the most important, because this period has
not only records of tremendous development, but an
application of its power so that it may lessen the bur-
dens of men, and the horse-power developed by the
steam turbines today is so great that it makes the
physical power of man and beast sink into utter insig-
nificance. This period with all its great accomplish-
ments is the one we are living in today and it is by
far the shortest, lasting from 1883 to the present day,
but 47 years.
The first commercial steam turbine was used in 1883
by Dr. DeLaval. He had patented and built a simple
reaction turbine which he used to drive one of his
cream separators. In the following year Mr. A. C.
Parsons built the first successful multi-wheel turbine,
using the combination of impulse and reaction prin-
ciples. In 1889 Dr. DeLaval patented the high speed
turbine, the wheel of which was mounted on a flexible
shaft. With this idea he startled the engineering world
because everyone thought it necessary to have a rigid
shaft in a turbine especially for one of high speed.
Dr. DeLaval found that a rotating mass, if not re-
stricted by a rigid shaft, would rotate about its center
of gravity without vibration, and with this high speed
he could get a fairly large power output with but a
small tortional strain on the shaft. Today we see
these men, Dr. DeLaval and Mrs. C. A. Parsons, cred-
ited with having done the most important work for
the development of the steam turbine. Their prin-
ciples of design are found in the latest turbines built,
and are being improved on technically and built larger
for a greater power output.
The high points of development in this last period
are too numerous to mention; however, most of them
are merely refinements of the general principles em-
bodied in the turbines designed and built by Dr. De-
Laval and Mr. C. A. Parsons.
The very beginning of the twentieth century saw
turbines of five thousand kilowatt capacity; in 1902 the
Commonwealth Edison Company had some of these
turbines installed at their Fisk Street Station (Chi-
cago). This was only about twenty years after the
appearance of the first commercial turbine. During
this time and a short time later, the sixes and capacities
of turbines were being pushed to the limit from the
point of view of structural strength. This brought the
engineers face to face with one of the latest problems
in turbine design, which concerns the vibrations of the
turbine wheel. This problem puzzled many engineers,
and the man to come to the foreground due to this
problem was Mr. Wilfred Campbell. He undertook
this work in 1919 in the laboratories of the General
Electric Company, and it was here where he made
many important investigations for the solution of this
problem. The value of Mr. Campbell's work may be
summarized in the remark made by Mr. F. C. Pratt,
Vice President of the General Electric Company, after
the death of Mr. Campbell: "He has made a fine and
lasting contribution to the industry and his work will
be long remembered by engineers who design and oper-
ate steam turbines." Before any solution of the prob-
lem of turbine wheel vibrations, the capacities of the
turbines were limited due to this difficulty, but now
that engineers have some knowledge of it, turbines of
much larger capacity are being built. One of the
largest steam turbines in operation today is owned by
the State Line Generator Company, near Chicago.
This unit, which has one high pressure and two low
pressure turbines, has a total capacity of 208,000 kilo-
watts.
The latest turbine development is that of the Em-
mett Mercury Vapor Process. This process does not
bring about any particularly great change in turbine
design, but uses a different driving element, using mer-
cury vapor in place of steam. It is still in the experi-
mental stage and there is only one such turbine in
operation today, which is located in the South Medow
Station at Hartford, Conn. It is being operated for
periods lasting from two to three weeks and is thor-
oughly inspected after each run.
In summing up the whole history we see that the
idea of the steam turbine really lay dormant for about
1,700 years, and then for 300 years it was but slightly
improved and not successfully applied; in the last fifty
years the development has gone in leaps and bounds.
Yes, the last twenty years has seen the greatest ad-
vancement. During recent years results have been
secured with steam turbines that only a short time ago
were considered practically unattainable. Primarily
their great success lies in their adaptability to operation
with high vacuums. Steam turbines are, therefore,
almost ideally suitable for the conditions of modern
engineering practice requiring both high vacuums and
high superheats. The application of the steam turbine
in serving mankind is daily gaining ground; it is the
greatest provider of power for generating electricity,
and for home and factory. It is rapidly replacing
other types of engines for marine use, having just re-
cently driven the two latest passenger liners, the Bremen
and Europa, across the Atlantic in record time. There
are also American ships on the New York-California
route which are driven by steam turbines.
Today, with the economical use of steam and be-
cause of improved manufacturing methods, first cost
is no longer a deciding factor. Thus, the steam turbine
has become our most important prime mover.

Vertical Transportation
The Creator of the Modern Skyscraper
By MALCOLM R. STIRTON, :I2,%
ARCHITECTURALLY speaking, the most
outstanding and most easily recognizable
surface characteristic of our present civili-
zation is the birth and development of our sky-
scraper cities. The first thing to impress the ob-
server as he approaches one of our great metropo-
lises is the striking skyline silhouette formed by its
building masses. His estimation of that city is
doubtlessly influenced by this first impression.
It is only in comparatively recent years that our
skylines have taken on this new individuality. Be-
fore the year 1856 when Elisha
G. Otis first demonstrated the
practicability of safely trans-
porting people in a vertical di-
rection, our skylines were
notably regular with a prac-
tically horizontal crest. After
the introduction of the safety
elevator, buildings threw off
their squat, and not particular-
ly inspiring characteristics,
and began their triumphant
struggle for impressive verti-
cality.
The development at first was
a trifle boisterous and not at
all concerned with interlocking
the different buildings into one
graceful composition. This de-
fect is distressingly manifest in
many of our larger cities where
each successive builder has at-
tempted to outdo his neighbor
either in height, lavishness or
bizarre effect. But cities are
today begining to become
civic-conscious and to devote a little thought to
future development. Of course the time thus be-
ing spent in preparing for the future is by no means
sufficient. However, without much fear of over
anticipation, we can look forward to the time when
all of our cities will concentrate on city planning
and endeavor to correct the errors of the past.
The most important factor in this upward trend
(jf the skyline was the development of a safe, rapid,
and non-laborious means of vertical transportation
as provided by the elevator. ,The economic success

of the elevator was hardly ever in doubt, although
prejudice and distrust of new-fangled inventions
manifested their usual impediments to its rapid de-
velopment. The comparatively high value of land
in thriving business centers required builders to
erect as high buildings as they thought the human
frame capable of ascending. To climb four of five
flights of stairs for a business transaction would
not have been greatly conducive to repeated visits.
Any means of saving such an expenditure of energy
was heartily welcomed and readily adopted.
The financial success of the
elevator required a highly
specialized engineering depart-
ment, one which was always
at least one jump ahead of the
public demand in elevator
service. Safety was, and is,
the vital factor to be consid-
ered at all times and every
step possible had to be taken
to prevent injury or probable
loss of life. Most accidents
occur at the elevator doors
either because of the doors
themselves or because of im-
proper alignment of the car
floor and the landing level. To
eliminate the human element
of miscalculation in leveling
the car floor, elevator engi-
neers have devised what is
known as Micro-Drive oper-
ation. The operator stops the
car at approximately the floor
line and the Micro-Drive au-
tomatically brings the car to a
perfect landing.
Push button control of elevators was a boon to
apparent buildings as it dispenses with an attend-
ant and, because of its simplicity, can be operated
by anyone. The main feature of push button con-
trol is the fact that both the hatch doors and the
car doors must be securely closed before the car
can operate. An additional safety provision has re-
cently been introduced called the movable plat-
form. Here the car floor must be depressed, as it

Broader Education in Engineering?
During the past decade the question of a broader
education in engineering has been discussed at
length. Prominent engineering educators have
taken a stand on the question. At the present time
there are more than one hundred and fifty engi-
neering schools in the United States with an en-
rollment of thousands of students and graduate en-
gineers. A change in the curriculum would be a
consideration of prime importance to these stu-
dents.
Those who advocate a revision in the curriculum
base their contention on the fact that there has been
little change in the engineering curricula since 1900.
It is true that technical subjects have replaced those
of a general nature and new courses have increased
the number of hours necessary for graduation un-
til now the engineer must complete an additional se-
mester's work in the allotted four years.
The requirements of the country as visioned in
1900 were no doubt provided for; as engineering as
a profession has made great strides in the past
thirty years, but have the changing social and eco-
nomic problems revised the needs of the country?
Men have been supplanted by machinery. Mass
production has enabled manufacturers to produce
goods faster than man can consume them. The
question that is asked by those who advocate the
change is; "Does the present engineering training
enable him to distribute and employ that which he
has so ably produced?" In the words of Mortimer
E. Cooley, former Dean of the Colleges of Engi-
neering and Architecture, "Summed up, modern
education, as I see it, has taught us how to earn
money more easily, but not how to spend it more
wisely. It has broadened the scope of human en-
deavor, opened the way to unparalleled wealth, and
enabled us to live midst marvelous material sur-
roundings. But in so doing it has narrowed human
relations, dulled our appreciation of natural pleas-
ures and lessened our sense of spiritual values. It
has loosed forces which, until balanced, must in-
evitably lead as their resultant points, be it for good
or for evil." Will engineering education in the
future erase this doubt?
The engineer in his work has created a new so-
cial system. Luxuries have become necessities,
and with these new social endeavors have come
hand in hand new social questions. Thus the en-
gineer must have a thorough knowledge of eco-
nomics and human relations. The relation of
natural resources to wealth and prosperity and the
extent and intelligent employment of these natural
resources are engineering problems. The engi-
neer is also becoming quite active in politics and
in so doing he must face problems of a diplomatic
nature. In this age of commercial endeavor the
welfare of our nation lies in the hands of the engi-
neer. To include necessary training courses to pre-
pare the engineer to meet these new problems which
now confront him would necessitate lengthening the
present curriculum. In addition to the technical
training now given, a year of non-technical study
would be arranged. This arrangement would not
affect industry as the change would be gradual and
technical men would continue to be available as
previously. In time the majority of the students
would be taking this five year course and each
year a new group of engineers would be graduated
to direct industry and insure continued prosperity.
The First International Subway
On November 3rd, the Fleetway or Detroit-
Windsor Tunnel was formally dedicated. The
opening marked the forging of the second link in

Canada. It will be remembered that just a year
previous to this date, the famous Ambassador
Bridge was opened to public use. Since that day it
has been in constant use, bringing together the
two countries holding so much in common but yet
widely separated by the bonds of government.
The opening of the vehicular tunnel has inaugu-
rated a competition that will be interesting to
watch. Which one, the bridge or the tunnel will
receive and disperse the most traffic? At the present
time it is very difficult to say. Several surmises
can be made, however, by surveying the general sit-
uation. The tunnel has been so placed that it
practically connects the main arteries of both cities,
Woodward Avenue in Detroit and Rouletto in
Windsor. It not only joins the main thorough-
fares but connects the principal business districts
of both cities. The Ambassador Bridge, on the
other hand, is some little distance from the business
district of Detroit. The Canadian terminal of the
bridge ends in a sparsely populated section of
Windsor. It can easily be deducted that the tunnel
will carry the burden of the business traffic while the
bridge will take care of the people who have homes
in Canada (due to caustic foresight) and work
in Detroit. The bridge traffic is constantly increas-
ing due to the increased number of these interna-
tional commuters, as it were. It is said, they en-
joy more liberal taxation in Canada. This alone is
a great inducement for the regular working man to
live there.
The great significance of the use of these two
means of commuting between Canada and the
United States lies in the fact that once' again the
engineer has been called upon to use his skill and
training to bring together two peoples. These
marvels of engineering skill will do more to bring
the people involved closer together than any World
Court or similar assembly has ever done.

Herbert H. Dow Passes
Dr. Herbert H. Dow, internationally known
chemist and president of the Dow Chemical Co.,
died at the Mayo Clinic at Rochester, Minn., Octo-
ber 15.
Dr. Dow was born February 26, 1866. In 1888
he graduated from the Case School of Applied Sci-
ence. He was always intensely interested in re-
search work. Early experiments with lithium and
bromine brough him to Midland to test the brine
there. Finding a rich deposit of bromine he came
here and established a laboratory. Finally he per-
fected an electrolytic cell to extract bromine, and
the development of this idea and its application to
other chemical revolutionized the industry. Fight-
ing his way through three failures he finally estab-
lished the Dow Chemical Co. in 1897, and became
the world's largest manufacturer of bromine and
allied products.
During the World War, and, with German chemi-
cal supplies cut off, the Dow Company came into
its own. The company became a $10,000,000 cor-
poration which manufactured explosives for the
government. Today the company, which has a sec-
ond plant at Mt. Pleasant, is one of the largest of
its kind in the country, and manufactures more than
160 products.
His inventive genius brought forth numerous
processes and equipment to produce chemicals on a
commercial scale. For this he was granted over
100 patents and rose to world fame. Recently the
University of Michigan conferred an honorary de-
gree in mechanical engineering upon him, Case
made him honorary doctor of engineering and he
was awarded Perkin medal for 1930, the highest
award in chemistry, on January 10, 1930, at New
York.
He was a member of the American Electrochem-
ical Society and American Institute of Chemical En-
gineers. o
The Frontispiece
"Along the Huron", an etching by Lyle F. Zisler,
'32A, was selected for the frontispiece this month.
This etching was one of a number exhibited by Mr.
Zisler at the Ann Arbor Art Association Exhibit in
Alumni Memorial Hall recently. It is a scene with
which we are all familiar. In the days preceding
the parental decision of the Board of Regents to
ban student driven automobiles this and many other
equally inviting spots were enjoyed by students who
find beauty in nature in the environ of their alma
mater.
The Honor System
One of the most frequently heard remarks on the
campus today is, "The honor system gives every
engineer an equal chance." It is probably meant to
be more than a mere jest, but I think it has out-
grown its stage of mirth and can be classed as an
indignity to the Engineering College.
But perhaps we should overlook these remarks
and forgive those who offer them, because of their
lack of perception of the honor spirit. To under-
stand it, one must experience the physical reac-
tion brought about by this mode of conduct, and it
cannot be condemned by those who cannot conceive
of this state of mind. Of course, it must be as-
sumed that each one has a conscience, and though
this seems doubtful in many cases, it is a true state-
ment for the majority. This is revealed in signing
the pledge for it has a stinging effect, forcefully
controlling the demeanor of the student.
The principal value of the honor system is its
effect upon the character of the student as a future

COLLEGE NOTES
Dean A. II. Lovell
Greatly lamented as was the death of Dean
George W. Patterson, the position of Assistant
Dean of the Colleges of Engineering and Architec-
ture has been filled by an exceptionally capable and
valuable man. Professor A. H. Lovell. Perhaps he
has not caught the eye of the average student more
than the other professors, but to his colleagues, his
personality is characterized by his vigorous and in-
tense progressiveness. It has been admiringly said
of him that he has no reverential awe for conven-
tion and usage where an opportunity for improve-
ment and efficiency suggests it-
self. And what could be a more
appropriate characteristic in a
great University such as Michi-
gan?
Dean Lovell is of Canadian
birth and primary schooling.
However, he took his university
training in Niagara Falls and
here at Michigan. Following his
graduation in 1909 he did engi-
neering work for two years and
then returned to his Alma Mater
to instruct. Various promotions
led to an Associate Professorship
in 1916, and in the meantime he
managed to do electrical engi-
neering design on projects in the
state. Dean Lovell was inci-
dentally field engineer on campus
projects, including the construc-
tion of the Natural Science build-
ing.
The war found him in the serv-
ice and in less than two years —
time was promoted from Captain
to the rank of Colonel, a rather startling rise. His
duty in England and France quickened in him a
keen interest for the people of the Continent. And
he returned to visit them in 1928, taking leave-of-
absence during the second semester—after enjoy-
ing a full professorship since 1919. During his
stay of eight months with his family he motored
8500 miles about Europe, investigating at the same
time many hydro- and steam-electric generating sta-
tions. Perhaps avid readers of the Technic will re-
call articles concerning his experiences.
Questioned as to his hobbies, Deon Lovell con-
fessed to a habit of regularly attending the meet-
ings of the more substantial engineering societies,
such as the A .1. E. E. And like many another he
has a passion for motoring, fishing and golfing.
Very unlike the average American is his keen inter-
est in the peoples of the Ro-
mance Language countries, and
their histories. It is even whis-
pered that he is studying Spanish
at the moment with the expecta-
tion of doing some more travel-
ing. Good luck!

From the Stump
The catalogue of the Colleges
of Engineering and Architecture
tells us that the Engineering So-
ciety is an organization whose
noble purpose is to promote pub-
lic speaking and create broader
fields of vision for engineering
students; it also maintains a
meeting room in the West En-
gine Building.
The society is now merely a
ghost of a unified organization,
although the smoking room still
exists, so the familiar room over
the arch will take on a different
^^^^^^^^^= aspect in a short time as it has
passed into the ambitious hands
of our rising declamatory group, Sigma Rho Tan,
who has said to itself—''Something ought to be

and put over our ideas without pulling at our
ties or getting our fingers in the soup 'mid the
gyrations of a mis-timed gesture. The idea is
worthy of applause and the organization's method
of getting results is commendable. The fraternity
has had unusual success during its short life and
several debates with other organizations have been
held. During this em-
bryonic state it became
more and more evident
that there was a ne-
cessity for some or-
ganized method of ob-
taining the type of lit-
erature which was de-
sired for reference. The
general library was
searched for articles and
references on interest-
ing engineering subjects,
but it was found that
there was no one over
there who read current
engineering topics and
said which ones should
be kept and which ones
rejected.
Sigma Rho Tan has
taken the matter over
and it is now organizing
a package library and
clipping service in the
West Engine Build-
ing. The literature is to
be housed in the engi-
neering library and will
be available to the sev-
eral chapters of the fra-
ternity. The old Engi-
neering Society's smok-
ing room will be con-
verted into a reading
and reference room and
less time will be devoted
to gazing at beauteous
womanhood as it passes
down the diagonal. The
library is the result of
the efforts of Dean Sad-
ler and Professor Brac-
kett, both men being vi-
tally interested in the
success of the project. The dream is finally be-
coming an actual success and much interest has
been shown, both by people on the campus and by
outsiders. The project is still in its infancy and,
like all infants needs nourishment, so a large shingle
bearing a lusty "Welcome" has been hung on the
door of Sigma Rho Tau. Philanthropists, either

We have with us one of
r^^kSB^^fc^i our fr'en&lt;ls wh°m we are
^ "^^^^ j glad to introduce as a top
rate athlete, a hard working
student, a good sport, a
pleasant personality, and
what's more—an engineer.
Clare John Wheeler was
born in Oneida, New York,
on a memorable day in
October, 1908. He had his
elementary education in the
schools of Bay City, Michi-
gan and he began to attain athletic prominence way back
when he played half-back for Central High. Jack played
high school football for three years.
When Jack came to the university in '27 he was a
shy and retiring frosh who had great respect and fear
of the ferocious sophs; this did not daunt him as he de-
cided that he was just as good football material as any
of them, so he reported to Coach Fisher and was put
on the frosh squad. After having battled against the
varsity for a year, he was promoted to the big team
where he developed a nice open field technique. He still
played his old high school position as half-back and put
in quite a bit of time in competitive play. Triangles,
honorary engineering fraternity, spotted Jack at about
this time and. after investigation the proposition, de-
cided to ask him in; he became a member of Triangles.
He also graces the picture of Theta Chi, national social
fraternity.
During these years we find our hero struggling indus-
triously with his deflections, stresses, and strains while
the B.S. in Civil Engineering looms in the distance. He
is on the squad again in his junior year; running, dodg-
ing, punting. He shows flashes of excellent football, but
docs not get into the game as much as he did in his
sophomore year. Back at school Jack has been made
junior representative to the Board in Control of Ath-
letics: he also serves as Honor Committee representative
for the junior engineering class. Michagamua admitted
him to its hallowed sanctuary in the Union during his
junior year. We don't know if he is Chief Ketchum-
Long-Pass, Little Galloping Horse, so we won't disclose
any secrets.
The culmination of his football career comes in his
senior year. Jack has developed a wonderful running
technique, he shows excellent foot and head work in
evading enemy tacklers, his kicking is accurate and re-
liable, and he is a steady defense man. He has "snagged"
several point-winning passes during the early games of
the season and his success has by no means come to an
end. His service to the Athletic Board still goes on,
his friends still like him, and he has almost reached the
old B.S. in C.E.
with interesting literature, or willing shekels, will
be most heartily welcomed.
Alarm!
What with Wisconsin's Governor Kohler and
Ruthie McCormick, we're having a deuce of a time
keeping up with our high handed politics. How-
ever, getting closer to
home and finding that
"Everything comes to he
who waits", reports
have it that the Student
Council has placed a
charge against Presi-
dent-EIect of the Senior
Class, Bigby, for flag-
rantly violating The
Corrupt Practices Act
by exceeding the maxi-
mum campaign expendi-
ture of $1.98. The coun-
cil investigation will
get under way imme-
diately and will attempt
to delve to the roots of
the matter. "Murder

to say.
Bigby's Independent
Laborites gained a de-
cisive victory over John-
son's Prosperity Nihi-
lists and Skae's Fratres
Reptiblicae in the re-
cent engineering elec-
tions. The results of
the election were quite
surprising so we just
attribute the charge to
an ordinary reflex of
some inhibited office
seeker.
We are with Messrs.
Bigby and associates,
heart and soul, and we're
sure that all charges
made against the de-
fendant are prejudiced
outcries of fallen angels.
\Ve believe that the elec-
tions went to the party
of the most merit. This
can be easily verified when one examines the plat-
form of the victorious party, for its obvious super-
iority can be immediately recognized.

Edwin Ernest Dreese
The College of Engineering can be justly proud
of the many graduates who have made good in their
respective professions since leaving the campus.
Numbers of these men have made good in business,
in research, and in inventive development lines.
Not a few have carried wonderful experience and
education gained in Michigan to
other of the most prominent =====
marts of knowledge. One in par-
ticular has carried his gift from
the University into active service,
and finally to the highest place in
his department of a rival Univer-
sity.
Hundreds of students come
every year from central and
northern Michigan. Back in
ninety-five, on September 10th, to
be exact, Edwin Ernest Dreese
opened his eyes and discovered
that Edmore, Michigan, was to
be his home. His parents were
of unusual stock, largely French
with a strain of Dutch, and were
interested in supplying general
merchandise to that section of
Michigan.
The young boy gained his
first schooling at Alanson, Mich- ======:
igan, and later attended the high school there,
graduating in his final year from Petoskey High
School. Not satisfied with carrying the usual
amount of work, he tutored in Latin and Trig-
onometry, and thus gained advanced credit for
himself when entering college. His work is mathe-
matics was such that for two years he taught the
branches of that subject in Petoskey High School
before entering the University.
The young man entered the University in 1915,
electing Literature, Science and the Arts, but real-
ized where the men of the campus really were, and
transferred to Engineering the second year. His
EDWIX ERNEST DREESE
courses were interrupted by the advent of the war,
and he was detailed to Signal Corps research, as a
private, to be sent a little later to the Bureau of
Standards, in Washington, D. C., where he spent
the last three months of 1917. In December of that
year, he was promoted to Second Lieutenant in the
Signal Corps, stationed in the
: office of the Chief Signal Officer
of the army, in Washington. His
work consisted of the supervision
of the distribution of corps train-
ing equipment to all Canton-
ments, Aviation Schools, and
training Camps. His work here
led to promotion, and from Au-
gust, 1919, to December, 1919, Mr.
Dreese was commanding Com-
pany B, of the Officers' training
Battalion at Camp Alfred Veil,
N. J., with the rank of First Lieu-
tenant. He later became Admin-
istrative Officer of the Air Serv-
ice Detachment, and was recom-
mended for promotion to Captain
at Camp Alfred Veil, in Decem-
ber, 1919. During the Summer
of 1919, Mr. Dreese worked for
the Michigan State Telephone
= Company, in the extension of
cable systems of Detroit.
Before finishing his college work, Mr. Dreese
was Teaching Assistant in the Literary College,
and varied his already interestingly varied life by
directing a Boy Scout Camp at Flint, Michigan,
during the summer of 1920.
It is significant that this alumni made Tau Beta
Pi, on one of the few enviable records of all "A"
marks during the whole term of college. He was
also elected to Sigma Xi, honorary Scientific So-
ciety.
Starting with the fall term of 1920, Mr. Dreese

instructed in the Electrical Engineering Depart-
ment of the College of Engineering, while working
upon an advanced degree, that of Master of Sci-
ence in Engineering, in Mathematics, and Pure Sci-
ence. While engaged as Instructor, he worked in
the development of two courses, one in the princi-
ples of oscillatory circuits with their application to
radio telegraphy and telephony for students of the
signal section of the Reserve Officers' Training
Corps. The other pertains to the electro-magnetic
properties of coils of various dimensions with their
applications to transformers, etc., and the influence
of iron and other metals in varying magnetic fields.
These courses are now offered in the engineering
college as "E.E." 10, and "E.E." 22.
During the summer of 1922, Mr. Dreese jour-
neyed to Indianapolis, Indiana, to give the benefit
of his experience to the Fairbanks-Morse Com-
pany, as Consulting Electrical Engineer. After re-
ceiving another degree, and instructing electrical
neophytes for four years, he went to Cleveland, and
there took a position with the Lincoln Electric
Company, staying with this firm until December of
1929.
On December 23, 1929, the appointment of Head
of the Electrical Engineering Department of the
Ohio State University was offered to Mr. Dreese,
and he accepted, his duties to start January 1st,
1930.
Professor Dreese is a member of the American
Institute of Electrical Engineers, and has written
several articles for the official organ of that so-
ciety, including two lengthy articles on the use of
Alternating Current Motors of the squirrel cage
type. These were published in June of 1928, and
January of 1929, respectively.
At the time of graduation in 1929, Professor
Dreese was called to the University of Michigan to
receive the honorary degree of Ph.D. in Electrical
Engineering, a signal honor in the Electrical world.
We are indeed glad to be able to record a few
of the steps in the life of a Michigan graduate who
has made good, to the eternal honor of the Univer-
sity that prepared him for the path which he was
to, and has followed to eminent success. He has
filled the requirements of student, of instructor, and
of engineer, and will ever be outstanding among the
Alumni Engineers of Michigan.

Mechanical Colloquium
Master of ceremonies, Liddicoat, has arranged
some exceedingly interesting talks and lectures for
the coming meetings of Mechanics Colloquium. The
colloquium's method consists of presenting current
topics in research and development in engineering
fields of mechanics before a mixed group of faculty
and students, then openly discussing the topic after
it has been presented. The meetings are usually
held on every other Thursday night; most of them
last about an hour and a half. The meetings are
interesting and some lively discussion often follows.
Sometimes Professor Liddicoat pulls a humorous
story—he has some good ones about long winded
speakers.
The next three talks should be especially inter-
esting because they deal with subjects of importance
to every student engineer. The talks were ar-
ranged by Mr. W. O. Freyburg, of the research de-
partment. This is the tentative arrangement:
"The Metallographic Study of Fractures in
Boiler Metal" by Mr. R. Schnederwindt.
"Detection of Strain in Metals by Mean of
X-rays" by Dr. L. Thomassen.
"Creep Characteristics of Metals and Alloys at
High Temperature" by Dr. C. L. Clark.
Students are welcome to the colloquium meet-
ings and it is never a waste of time to listen in
on these discussions.
College Notes
No doubt many of us have passed the bust
of Dean Cooley on the second floor of the West
Engineering Building. It was presented to the
University last year and has just been formally
finished by the placing of a plate bearing the class
numerals upon it.
The work itself was done by Carleton Angell, a
member of the faculty of the Architectural School,
and is pronounced by those who know, to be an
excellent likeness of the Dean Emeritus.
Gifts
Several new awards and gifts have been made to
the engineers for the coming year.
James Baird, of the engineering class of 1896,
has donated $1,000 for a loan fund which was named
after him; another gift of $2,000 in equipment was
made to the engineering shops by the Oxweld
Acetylene Company, of Chicago. The Michigan
Gas Association has renewed an annual scholarship
of $1,000; this scholarship was established in 1900
and was maintained regularly, with the exception
of the years during the World War, The Detroit
Edison Fellowship in Chemical Engineering has
also been renewed.
Aeronautical Department
Professor Edward A. Stalker was recently made
head of the new department of aeronautical engi-
neering by the board of regents. The department
of aeronautics was developed before the war, but it
had never been listed as a distinct department,
being a part of the marine engineering division.
Professor Pawlowski had been acting as head of
the division up to the time when Mr. Stalker was
appointed.
Professor Stalker is a graduate of Michigan; he
received his degree in 1919 and went to work for
the Stout laboratories in Detroit. In 1929 he re-
turned to the university where he has been an in-
structor in aeronautical engineering. Mr. Stalker
received his master's degree in science in 1923 and
is known in the aeronautical field for his work in
stress analysis and airplane design. He is editing
a book on aerodynamics at the present time.
Transportation
The Transportation Club is again under way
with a most vigorous program for the coming year.
The officers for the coming year are:
President Cedric S. Wood
Vice-President George L. Beard
Secretary-Treasurer.. .Howard P. Walker
Negotiations are now being made to secure such
prominent speakers as:
Mr. Garrott, Chief Engineer of the Cleveland
Terminal.
Mr. Shaeffer, Vice-President in charge of oper-
ations of the Pennsylvania Railroad.
Mr. Laird, Bridge Engineer for the Grand Trunk
Railroad.

A great number of trips to the neighboring cities
are being planned. Such points of interest as the
Cleveland Terminal, Chicago Airport, Michigan
Central Shops and the various projects in and
around Detroit will be visited. The membership
in this Club is open to all students interested in this
field. It is expected that a great number of men
from the freshman and sophomore classes will avail
themselves of this opportunity.
Last month the University of Michigan had the
honor of playing host to the delegates of the Perma-
nent International Association of Road Confer-
ences. Over sixty different countries are repre-
sented in this association for the advancement and
improvement of highway engineering.
The last meeting of the conference was held in
1926 in Milan, Italy, this year it was held in Wash-
ington and the next meeting will be held in Munich
in 1934.
Professor Morrison of the Highway Engineering
Department of the University was one of the dele-
gates this year to the conference. He was one of
those appointed by the Secretary of State to repre-
sent our country.
Seats at the Illinois-Michigan football game were
included in the entertainment provided by the Uni-
versity for its guests. The delegates were also
taken on an inspection trip of the Transportation
Library, the Highway Laboratory, the Wind Tun-
nel, the Naval Tank, Clements Library and the Law
Club.
Chemical Engineering
The department is carrying on some research in a
new process of coke manufacture. The new method
being developed will produce coke much faster than
the old baking process as coking takes place in the
remarkably short time of a few minutes. This is
accomplished by pulvering the coal and injecting it
into empty retorts which have walls heated to very
high temperatures.
Our Professors Write
Recent contributions to practical engineering
problems by University of Michigan faculty include
the first bibliography on the cutting of metals by
Orlan W. Boston, and chapters in Marks Engineers
Handbook by Professor Stephen Timoshenko, John
E. Emswiler and Boston, are among the recent con-
tributions of the University of Michigan College of
Engineering and Architecture in the field of practi-
cal engineering problems.
Professor Boston, who is Director of the Depart-
ment of Engineering Shops and a specialist in shop
practice, has long been interested in the study of
metal cutting, and has made many experiments in
this important but little known industrial field. The
bibliography is the first made in the field and is ex-
pected to be of great value to engineers and shop
men in all industries where metals must be cut.
"Strength of Materials" is discussed by Professor
Timoshenko of Engineering Mechanics, "Building
Construction and Equipment" is partly written by
Professor Emswiler, who teaches Mechanical Engi-
neering, and Professor Boston contributes to the
subject of "Machine Shop Practice," in Marks
Handbook, which is internationally used among en-
gineers as a reference book.
Growth of Research
Growth from an experiment in cooperation be-
tween industry and college specialists in industrial
engineering problems begun in 1921, to a valued
service which expended $323,441 and employed 313
persons during 1929-1930 is the record of the Uni-
versity of Michigan Department of Engineering Re-
search, according to Director Albert E. White.
Service charges to clients of the Department
amounted to $309,921, exclusive of fellowships and
trust funds. This was 66 per cent more than the
previous year, despite recent adverse business con-
ditions, and at least three quarters of this sum was
paid for research of a very fundamental scientific
nature.
In addition to its use and value to Michigan in-
dustry the Department has done rich service to the
University as well.
Research employed 50 full time workers and over
200 part time workers and investigators. One hun-
dred and seventy of those employed were students,
58 being graduates. These earned $135,459 or an
average of $790, enabling many gifted students to
advance in their chosen fields. For 50 faculty mem-
bers the Department added a total of $56,544 to
their salaries.
In addition, the Department expended $4,584 for
research activities, made $5,466 available to other
departments for research purposes, spent $5,386 for
publications, added over $200 worth of library
books, and bought $32,573 worth of research equip-
ment, practically all of which is expected to become
the University's permanent property.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
TRANSIT SLANTS
The time honored custom of rating the co-eds
from the vantage position just inside the arch has
vanished, it seems, with the proximity of the Senior
benches to the diagonal. True, some of the old
guard make, from time to time, rather luke warm
attempts at revival, but such efforts, being prac-
tically unsupported, quickly peter out.
In times gone by, the "boys" would line the
southeast end of the diagonal and assume the grave
role of a gang of judicial Indians. For every mem-
ber of the weaker sex who emerged from the
yawning maw of the Arch, the judges would set
down a grade; A, if she was excellent; B, good; C,
fair, and so forth. In not a few cases disputes would
arise, and the point in question would be debated
with heat in the unavoidable presence of the lady.
Some of the co-eds bore up well under the strain,
even enjoying the ordeal, while others, less gifted
by nature, displayed unmistakably signs of violent
mental anguish.
If anything really worthy of note happened along,
the benches would fairly hum with a bussle of
admiration. From a squad of M.E.S. would come
some rather significant mutterings concerning
"super heat" or "high pressure" and the Electricals
would entreat one another to "take a couple of
readings on that pair of ground connections".
But now all that is changed. The campus queens
sail placidly in and out of the arch and are scarce-
ly noticed.
The Europa, bound for Bremen was on it's first
day out. A group of college girls gathered at the
table in the salon with that eagerness characteristic
of the weaker sex. The waiter approached with a
pitcher of ice water.
"Wasser, Fraulein?" he asked.
"No," replied one of the girls with rare intelli-
gence, "Wellesley."

roved nervously up and down the crowded street,
had something of the hunted beast in them. Rov-
ing, always roving. Suddenly he stiffened. His
jaw shot out menacingly. He took a quick step
forward, thrust a clinched hand into his pocket—
others had clone it and got away with it, why
couldn't he?
He gave one more all-encompassing look and
strode forward, glancing at the smiling face that

vance. His hand came out of his pocket with light-
ning-like speed. Something glittered as it caught

PAN-AMERICAN HIGHWAY
(Continued from page 11)
by the local peon laborer with the help of the pick,
shovel, and the grace of God. Mexico, Panama, and
Colombia proved the exceptions, as machinery was
utilized in these nations in a rather limited fashion.
The prevailing surfacing on most of the highways
along the route is either dirt or macadam because
these types proved easy to construct with available
material. The construction, however, was slip-
shod and unenduring in many cases, and where
heavy rainfall occurs there were found to be fre-
quent washouts. This was the situation when The
Second Pan-American Highway Congress met in
Rio de Janeiro in August, 1929. The Congress de-
termined to smooth out some of these difficulties
and they drew up a national construction code
which was to be used in the remaining work. The
progressive system of procedure was adopted so
that improvement might be made as the traffic de-
manded, this being the most economical method as
proven in the United States. A great deal of care
and effort was exercised when the code was drawn
and it contains recommended procedures for con-
structing the best known types of concrete, dirt, and
macadam surfaced roadways. Methods of improv-
ing macadam roads were pointed out for the fu-
ture betterment of the existing roads of this kind.
Most of the methods to be used are those which
have shown their repeated superiority under vary-
ing conditions in our country and provisions are
being made for the organization of testing stations
where materials and methods will be tested follow-
ing standard procedures; it is advised that the sta-
tions be exchange stations so that the various re-
sults may be accessible to each of the participating
nations. A glossary of technical terms was drawn
up in the several languages so that misunderstand-
ings and confusion might be avoided.
The next major problem that confronted the as-
sembly was the matter of financing the remaining
work and this had such a formidable aspect that it
was indeed most disheartening. Topography and
climate were found to be much different in each ter-
ritory and in no two countries were the costs and
conditions of construction found to be the same.
The average cost per mile of macadam roads ranges
from about $4500 in Guatemala to $10,000 and
$20,000 in Colombia and Salvador. These costs are
set by the conditions encountered and, naturally,
where the country is rocky and mountainous, the
costs run to an excessive height due to heavy cuts,
retaining walls, bridges, and tunneling. Heavy pre-
cipitation also causes much trouble, especially in the
Central Americas, where washouts are very numer-
ous. The provisions for obtaining funds for road
building were found to be exceedingly inadequate
and, in most cases, the money banks provided for
this purpose were much like deflated balloons.
Some of the governments levied taxes on "capital-
ists" and imposed fines on drunken soldiers, while
others assumed that the property owners adjacent
to the highways must bear the brunt of the burden
of construction costs. Vehicle taxes and a popu-
lar tax were very rare specimens to be found in
only the most progressive nations. That the
peoples of these nations are so blissfully contented
and so difficult to arouse to any degree of enthus-
iasm even though the government attempts to
forge ahead is, without a doubt, ample proof of the
fact that their progressiveness has been limited.
The South American part of this highway is one
of the most fascinating and interesting sectors of
the whole project. Here the road will pass down
the west coast between the majestic Pacific and
the mighty Andes. The traveler may examine the
time-defying structures of the Incas or climb the
Andes and view Ecuador's smouldering Cotopaxi
or he may steam up South American rivers to un-
explored forests and wander amid the ruins of the
peoples of 3000 years ago. This is a land of ad-
venture and romance.
About 175 miles of roadway between Chepo, in
Panama, and Bogota, the capital of Columbia, must
be completed before the highway can be properly
introduced in South America. Part of this distance
is covered by an existing road but conditions are
not very favorable to automobile travel. Highways
have already been constructed over a great part of
Colombia and need only be linked together to form
a continuous chain in the Inter-American High-
way. The National Assembly of Ecuador recently
voted $80,000 for the completion and improvement
of the road between Ibarra and the Colombian
boundary to the north. The road to the frontier of
Peru is intermittant and passable all of the way
and, at the border, connections with the Great
Longitudinal Coastal Highway will soon be made.
The great highway extends along the coast of Peru
for a distance of 1500 miles and passes through
Lima down to La Paz near the Chilean boundary.
Lima was founded by Pizarro in 1535 and his
mummified remains may be seen in the great ca-
thedral of which he laid the foundation. At La
Paz the traveller may go a short way and take a
steamboat trip on the world famous Lake Titicaca.
In Chile, the route will run directly south through
Tacna to Antofagasta and on to Santiago. This
distance is about 1600 miles and lies along the
course of an old military road upon which work has
been done to accommodate more traffic.
Santiago and Valparaiso are very modern cities
and there are excellent accommodations for the
tourist. From here the route goes southward
through Concepcion and then continues to the great
gap in the Andes at Puerto Montt, where the high-

WHAT SHALL I READ
(Continued from page 9)
its people, that one loses utterly any sense of
strangeness. One sees the struggle between the
new Christianity and the old paganism, one sees the
pageantry of church and state, the building of the
cathedrals to the glory of a God only half con-
ceived, one sees processions of nuns and the gor-
geous ecclesiastic ceremonials, and hears the ringing
of church bells across the blue fjords, but some-
how all these things lost their strangeness. Per-
haps the fact that the author from her girlhood lived
and worked with her father who was one of the
greatest living authorities on Norweigian antiquities
made it possible for her to assimilate the limitless
historical detail and fuse it into a living picture. In
her imagination she had lived all her life in this
world of 14th century Norway which she now re-
produced.
Madame Undset's powers of description are quite
dynamic. She has the ability to create a picture of
exquisite clearness almost with a single stroke. She
is a keen observer of the minutest details and uses
them with telling effect. One marvels that anyone
could have noted such a variety of weather ef-
fects. To read her novels gives one as vivid a feel-
ing for the scenery and atmosphere of Norway as a
trip in a motor along the Norwegian fjords. Note
the following which are typical of her method:
"They were up at cock-crow: it was dark with-
out, with thick mist between the houses as Kristin
peeked out of the door at the weather. The mist
billowed like grey smoke round the lanterrfs, and
out by the open house-doors. Folk ran twixt
stables and outhouses, and women came from the
kitchen with steaming porridge pots and trenchers
of meat and pork—they were to have plenty of
good, strong food before they rode out into the
morning cold."
"And so they rode out of the courtyard into the
gray light. The fog lay white as milk upon the
parish. But in a while it began to grow thinner and
the sunlight sifted through. And dripping with
dew there shone through the white haze hill-sides,
green with the aftermath, and pale stubble-fields,
and yellow trees, and rowans bright with red ber-
ries. Glimpses of blue mountain-sides seemed ris-
ing through the steamy haze—then the mist broke
and drove in wreaths across the slopes, and they
rode down the Dale in the most glorious sunshine,
Kristin in front of the troop at her father's side."
"It was biting cold , and the northern-lights
flamed and flickered over the brows of the fells to
the north. The snow crackled under Kristin's feet
as she ran over the courtyard shivering, her arms
crossed on her breast."
"At the end of the street, in a blue-green sky,
rode the new moon's sickle with a bright star with-
ing its horn."
The fjords and mountains in all conditions of
weather, in mist and in sunshine, the effects of
distance, of elevation, the dim, brown interiors
lighted with candles or firelight,—the variety of
her pictures baffles any attempt to list or catalog
them. Three of them done on rather large can-
vases will remain in my memory at least as imper-
ishable treasures.
The first is the moment when Kristin stands
looking down the; hillside watching the funeral
train of her father, Lavrans, as it moves slowly
down the mountain. There are the priests and the
acolytes with the crosses and tapers, and there is
the distant chanting drifting back to her from the
distance. In her life it is a dramatic moment for
she had loved her father passionately and yet her
whole life had been directed in ways that tore his
heart and wrecked his happiness. The second is a
sunset hour when Kristin sits on the hill north of
the houses at Husaby and thinks of her sons. The
bells in the church far below her which have been
ringing fall silent, and as the color fades and the
twilight settles over the great manor below her on
the hillside she looks back over her life and the
patient and unflinching way she had borne her lot.
And then one is allowed to look into the very heart
of her mother love as she considers what each of
her seven sons has meant in her unfolding char-
acter.
The death scene of Olaf Audunsson in The Son
Avenger is entirely different, but it is quite the best
of the many rich, dark studies Madame Undset has
given of ecclesiastical ceremonials.
Kolbein and Torgilis, the little grandsons, who
have been allowed to hold the candles, watching in
excitement to see if anything will happen, if any
change will come over the old man's ruined face
when the priest absolves him of his sins in God's
name, Erick, her foster son bowed in his genuine
grief, the confession and the anointing,—it is one
'of the most exquisitely wrought pictures in her en-
tire gallery of wonderful scenes.
When I began what seemed in prospect a genu-
ine task, the reading of seven great novels dealing
with a foreign land and a remote age, I wondered if
my interest would hold out for the ordeal. But as
I read, I was increasingly thankful for vast pro-
portions of the novels. I was almost sorry to have
my first reading finished. Now I shall do it all over
again and I know I shall see many beautiful as-
pects of Madame Undset's work which have so far
escaped my notice.

It is the ability of Jenkins Valves to take the hard

of pipe weight, settling, lifting, expansion and

Into the making of every Jenkins goes a craftsman-
ship that can come only from many years of

FREDERICK LAW OLMSTEAD
(Continued from page 14)
would be if the car had an occupant, before com-
plete lack of them in America. Following this ini-
tial venture into writing, he met with such marked
success, that his books and writings on Nature de-
scriptive accounts of this travels appear at frequent
intervals—which ultimately placed him before the
public eye, unconsciously paving the way for bigger
things.
In the meantime America was slowly becoming
aroused to the necessity for parks. New York City,
fast becoming a metropolis, was the first to become
truly park—or lack of park—conscious. The cru-
sade for an adequate park for New York became the
vital factor in the political campaign. And here the
story of Olmstead's ultimate association with the
great Central Park project and his ultimate fame as
a landscape architect begins. From out of the
melee of political patronage which followed the
election, there emerged the new appointive office of
"Superintendent of Central Park". Deemed to be
a farce by the politicians, but taken in good faith by
the public spirited citizens of New York, a peti-
tion was circulated by influential citizens to place
Olmstead in the position. Olmstead was accepted.
The plan governing the project had been pre-
pared by the City Engineer, an uninspired and
haphazard piece of work, and was deemed unsatis-
factory by the Park Board. As a result a compe-
tition was held for a new design. Olmstead, acting
as nominal Superintendent, was asked by Calvert
Vaux, the distinguished French landscape designer,
to collaborate on a plan. This was the beginning of
the life long friendship and ultimate partnership of
Olmstead and Vaux. There were thirty-three de-
signs submitted—"Greensward" the plan of Olm-
stead and Vaux was selected.
Thus began the great romance of the develop-
ment of Central Park. Olmstead, long trained as an
observer of Nature, coupled with his natural ability
to lead men, was eminently fitted for his new posi-
tion. Throughout the long period of his life that
he spent an Architect-in-Chief and Consultant of
the Park, he clung tenaciously to his ideals and
original conception of the design. Always against
opposition of the most treacherous and corrupt po-
litical machine of New York's history. Repeatedly
he stood alone, his back to the wall fighting for his
ideals, reluctantly, if ever, conceding measures
against his policy. Time after time being forced by
his convictions to resign in disgust and despair—
repeatedly to be called back to again to take the
executive position. His results stand as a more or
less permanent monument to his memory in the
great Central Park of New York City—a haven to
thousands of people stifling in the great metropolis
of steel and smoke—a pastorale of cool green and
shade, woodland lakes, bridle trails, picnic grounds,
and long cool promenades. A spot to relax and rest
in a canyon of skyscrapers.
Although Central Park will probably always re-
main as Olmstead's greatest achievement, his plan
for the Great Columbian Exposition at Chicago in
1893 stands a very close second. Here the task
seemed super-human—to develop a low marshy
abandoned ground suitable to accommodate the
largest Fair ever held. The beauty of the lakes
and lagoons, the great formal gardens, the great
promenades, the wealth of flowers, trees, and
shrubs which were everywhere in abundance place
Olmstead as a genius.
During the forty years in which Frederick Law
Olmstead practiced his profession, he planned and
replanned hundreds of cities, served as consultant
of hundreds of park boards in the United States and
abroad. Until his death in 1903, he continued to
work seemingly untireingly for the betterment of
the municipal life and happiness of the cities of
America. He will always remain the Dean of
American Landscape Architects.
VERTICAL TRANSPORTATION
(Continued from page 15)
plete contact is made. Three contacts must then be
closed before the car can be put in motion.
There are several safety devices operated by the
car in conjunction with the elevator shaft, the most
important of which is known as the "safety". There
are many types of safeties in use such as the wedge
clamp, the flexible guide clamp, and the roll safety,
but they are all alike in principle. When the car
attains an excessive speed, as it would should the
cables break, a high speed governor located on the
machine room floor trips the safety on the plank
channels of the car frame. The action of the safety
is to thrust wedges against the guide rails, which
extend the full length of the hatchway, and, through
frictional resistance, to bring the car to a com-
plete stop. In event the car is so near the bottom
of the hatchway when the cables break that the
safety is unable to act, spring-return oil buffers
in the pit absorb the shock of the rapidly descending
car and stop it without causing the passengers any
undue comfort.
However, elevator engineering did not stop at
safety measures but carried the same ingenuity into
the perfecting of the elevator service itself. Every
type of motive power has been utilized, from hand
power to the complex Multi-Voltage control. The
older types of power, such as steam, have died out
and now even the hydraulic elevator is fast be-
coming obsolete. There are many existing hy-
draulic installations still giving good service as in
the Detroit City Hall, but its inherent disabilities

have rendered hydraulic operation unfit for any but
slow, heavy duty freight.
Modern elevators and their operation are not fully
appreciated by the lay mind but taken more or less
for granted. It would be impossible to enter into
the intricacies of their wiring or mechanical equip-
ment without becoming excessively technical.
However anyone riding in an elevator in one of our
skyscrapers cannot but feel respect for the engi-
neering genius that has made such transportation
possible. To the casual observer, the skyscraper
controls the elevator but if he were to examine more
closely he would see that all the life and activity of
these great towers are bound up in their elevator
service and their success as commercial ventures
depends, to a great extent, upon the smoothness and
dependability of their vertical transportation facili-
ties.
Xaturally enough, then, the architect must at all
times be willing to co-operate with the elevator en-
gineer in the planning of the system of elevators,
their number and their arrangement throughout
the building, and to make adequate provision for
the elevator machine rooms and pits. Right there
is where the necessary inter-working is often so
sadly lacking. The architect has too frequently the
idea that elevator machinery can be placed without
definite relationship between the several pieces and

that, if necessary, it can be made to fit whatever
penthouse looks best in his design. On the other
hand, the elevator expert desires an ideal situation
and refuses to compromise. If the architect and the
elevator engineer would consult each other as to
their needs while the project is still in its prelimi-
nary stages, the majority of their differences could
be adjusted to the satisfaction of all concerned.
The elevator, properly built and installed with
due regard to public service and efficient operation,
is the heart beat of the entire building organism.
It has created for Architecture a new principle, a
new creed—it has endowed the profession with a

College Notes
(Continued from page 26)
Not since Stephenson's creation of the Rocket,
nearly one hundred years ago, has such an eminent
rival provoked competition.
This newest development is an oil-electric loco-
motive which offers lower operating cost and more
uniform speed. During the three hundred thirty-
four mile race, the oil electric consumed $25.00
worth of oil, while the steam locomotive used
$80.00 worth of coal. The oil electric accelerated to
sixty miles per hour in two minutes, about twice
the rate of a steam locomotive, and maintained a
speed of seventy and seventy-five miles per hour
for many miles.
Contrary to the use of the third-rail system and
power-plant, necessary to other electric trains, none
is required by the oil-electric, being a primary
power vehicle, that is, one that generates the elec-
tricity it consumes. Each of the two units in this
locomotive has a twelve cylinder Diesel engine
which drives an electric generator, which, in turn,
moves individual motors that turn the four pairs of
driving wheels on each unit.
Predictions point to this locomotive's replacing
the steam engine, and delaying or postponing elec-
trification, though they seem rather hazy and un-
based. It is time that such economy must not be
overlooked, but the proximity of a fuel shortage is
a huge impediment that is delaying adoption. It
seems evident that the future of the oil-electric
rests in the hands of the chemists who are at-
tempting to develop synthetic petroleum.
R. S. RICE, JR.
Electricity
When the word electricity is mentioned we im-
mediately think of that unseen power that has such
an awful jolt if allowed to pass through your body;
that which lights our homes and streets, turns our
machinery and many other useful services; but
when the word radio is mentioned we do not always
think of electricity yet radio is only a particular ap-
plication of electricity. The discovery of elec-
tricity was fundamental but the discovery of radio
was merely an addition to our knowledge of the
electrical field.
Now that it has been shown that the radio is
simply another application of electricity and that
the greatness of radio makes the electrical field
greater, let us see just how much the radio is doing
for mankind and if it is worth all that is claimed for
it.
Radio has given us the fastest communication
known, yes, so fast that it is difficult for man to un-
derstand such speed; it has enabled men to talk
from the South Pole to New York, and other men
in aeroplanes or airships speeding through the
clouds were permitted to carry on conversation with
the world below. All wonderful, but is this all?
We may, without hesitation answer, No. What then
is the greatest contribution of the radio to man-
kind? It is paving the way to universal peace if such
a thing is possible. Before the day of radio, the
hatred and temper of men could easily be stirred up
by mere newspaper scandal, people could only read

opinions of the local editor and his staff, but now
that radio is in most of the homes, the people hear
more of great and broadminded men. Newspapers
try to print the unusual and the unusual in most
cases is the undesirable; radio, although much of
the undesirable is broadcast gives mostly the every-
day lives and thoughts of men of high ideals be-
cause the owners of the stations try to get the best
speakers to speak over their stations.
Yes, if peace is permanently established the radio
will undoubtedly be the most important factor and
it is electricity that makes radio.

it is an ideal created from a voluntary mode of con-
duct. The engineer must be self-reliant and inde-
pendent of thought for the creative work expected
of him, and this ideal of honor is the theoretical
background for the practical development of these
qualities.
Engineers, let us seriously uphold our sacred

ROBERT S. RICE.
Lately there has been a great deal of criticism, on the
campus and elsewhere, that the status of the University
of Michigan is fast degerating, and that conditions here
are becoming well nigh intolerable. In the midst of all
this criticism everyone seems to have forgotten the
many fine points and good qualities of the institution.
The fine men on the faculty are either losing faith at
the excoriating words of the critics, or their good
work is being rendered negligible by the storm of sensa-
tional abuse, actually directed towards the many medi-
ocre or poor instructors around them. The many lib-
erties and privileges allowed the students, in compari-
son with other schools, are forgotten in the raillery

Where body
stamina counts
In the long grind, it's the athlete with the stamina
who lasts.
So, too, with a Jenkins Valve. It's the body stamina
that counts, that keeps the valve in the line, un-
affected by the strains of pipe weight and settling,
lifting, expansion, contraction or frequent operation.
Jenkins bronze valves are cast of virgin metal;
Jenkins iron body valves of a high quality, close-
grained mixture. Metals are analyses-controlled by
Jenkins metallurgists. Skillful design is provided
to make possible an even distribution of metal
throughout the valve body.
Jenkins Valves are made in bronze and iron, in
standard, medium and extra heavy pattern—a valve
for practically every valve need.

Jenkins Valves for any type of
building in which you may bt

Metal on trial
In the laboratories of scores of foundries and rolling mills,
a constant search is being conducted for a metal that is
•tronger, more resistant to temperature strains, and more
economical to produce. Almost as constantly the com-
pounds and alloys so developed are being brought to
Crane Co. for trial.
The court that passes on them b composed of the most
experienced Crane designers, metallurgists, and engineers.
Under its direction bars of the new metals are carefully
tested for ductility, reduction of area, elastic limit, and
yield and breaking points. Hardness, transverse strength,
and torsional strength are measured, behavior under tem-
perature strains b determined by" I ooo-hour creep tests."
When the findings of all tests are favorable, the metals
are made into valves and fittings for trials in the Crane
plant that will approximate actual working conditions.
Then, Crane Co. sends out these new materials to cer-
tain engineers who are interested in advancing piping
practice. They use them in actual service: observing
them over long periods, sending full reports to Crane Co.
Not only do materials thus developed serve all industry.
They have contributed to a vast library of engineering
data on metals and their capabilities. Much of this is em-
bodied in a book, "Pioneering in Science," a valuable
reference manual for students. Let us send it to you.

at the Manufacturer's Command
How the Department of Engineering Research
of the University of Michigan Serves
the Industries of the State
The Department of Engineering Re-
search of the University of Michigan is
designed to assist the industries of the
State in placing at their disposal the en-
tire scientific resources of the Univer-
sity.
It is not organized for the mere run-
ning of routine tests or the solution of
minor shop problems, but for the ex-
haustive study and investigation of
scientific manufacturing problems crit-
ical to the progress of forward look-
ing industries.
Through this Department the manu-
facturer may secure the service of
trained scientists, special laboratories,
library facilities and testing equipment
of exceptional sort, and the sustained
and thorough quality of research work
which is to be found in a great uni-
versity.
Under the present generous patent
arrangements, clients of the Depart-
ment may, by the payment of a some-
what higher service charge, secure the
benefits to be derived from all inven-
tions, patents and patenable processes
resulting from the investigations made
in their behalf.
All problems submitted to the De-
partment should be addressed to the
Director. Such problems will be care-
fully studied and only those will be
undertaken in which it is felt that the
Department may be of service to the
prospective client. The regular service
charge for such work is thirty per cent,
based on labor.

Oxwelain^ ior Economy
Through the use of oxy-acetylene welding for maintenance and repair,
substantial economies in operating costs can be effected.
In almost every scrap-pile there are thousands of dollars' worth of
damaged or worn tools and equipment, much of which could be welded
into perfect condition and restored to service at a fraction of its re-
placement cost.
A foundry, realizing this, now saves $72,000 a year by oxwelding
cracked pipe flasks that were formerly discarded.
Such a saving, while large, is not unusual. It can be duplicated in
practically every industry that uses metal. Investigate the possibili-
ties of oxwelding. It will pay. We shall be glad to furnish you with
further information.

The Cleveland Union Terminal
By PAUL R. GUTHRIE
Graduate School. Transportation Engineering
A VISITOR in Cleveland, Ohio, as late as
the summer of 1926 would have seen, on
his five hundred yard walk east from the
High Level Bridge to the Public Square, a row of
three or four story brick buildings gray with age,
slatternly with decreptitucle, inhabited by small
"fly-by-night" establishments which seem to huddle
naturally in such surroundings. A "down-at-the-
heel" locality, a half ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
mile west of the
fine business dis-
trict of the city, yet
a locality through
which passes, by
bus, automobile,
and street car, near-
ly a half of the rush
hour traffic of the
city.

ment store in the course of construction constitutes
the group.
These structures, although covering a consider-
able area, utilize only the air rights of a far greater
and far more important undertaking, a $148,000,000
development as compared with the $31.000.000 de-
velopment of the air right buildings. This expendi-

constructions of a
passenger terminal
(k n o w n as the

the expansion of
the properties of
the proprietary rail-

cern to the Engineer, but the formulation of the
idea and the reasons behind the actual construc-
tion should be of greater interest.
Metropolitan Cleveland may be compared to
two great fans with the Public Square at the base
of each. Eastward and south-by-east one fan ex-
tends for twenty miles, the other westward and
south-by-west for fifteen miles with the north side
of each fan parallel to Lake Erie and the two fans
separated by the wide Cuyahoga Valley extending
to the south. The topography formed a barrier
which restricted the growth of residential suburbs,
made difficult and expensive the passage of traffic
between the two sections, forcing property values
to move eastward along Euclid Avenue. This would
have materially restricted the growth of the city in
years to come through the inability of its people to
commute between their homes and the commercial
districts, quickly, and with minimum expense. Rail-
road passenger traffic ran along the lake and the
passenger entered the city through a dingy, half-
century old structure known as the Union Depot
which was more like an ancient penal institution
in appearance than an entrance to a live and busy
city. No monetary value can be placed on the im-
pressions of the passenger; needless to say, they
could not have been favorable toward a city which
tolerated such a debt.
The idea was to remove this obstacle which pro-
hibited the flow of mass traffic, to furnish trans-
portation facilities which would increase the num-
ber of suburban homes, consequently increase the
health and happiness of the population.
Private capital could not promote such an enter-
prise without hope of reward and fair return. A re-
turn from transportation made easy for the city
population, a return from unified and co-ordinated
control of both rapid transit and street railway
facilities, a return guaranteed, in part, by the tre-
mendous rapid transit possibilities in the opening
up of hitherto unoccupied territories for residence,
for factories and for industry with the further op-
portunity for profit in the rise of real estate values
in the aforesaid territories. It was but natural,
when the idea of the concentration of such a mass
of traffic was formulated, that the concomitant
thought of constructing a group of fine buildings to
cater to and to serve this mass of humanity, was
formed with the very probable result of reversing
the hitherto steady march of real estate values away
from the Square, which was formerly the civic cen-
ter, returning the flow of business to the Terminal
Group with its consequent gains in rentals and in-
creased property values.
Finished? No. Rapid transit must be extended
westward. Westside street car traffic must be
taken off the Public Square and operated under the
Square or under and through the Terminal, the
latter being the more preferable, before the maxi-
mum capacity of the project can be realized.
Many important factors were involved in the lo-
cation of the Terminal. For the steam railways it
was desirable that the station be placed at a cen-
tral point. From a strategic point of view, it was
absolutely essential that the terminus of the rapid
transit and the street railway should also have
a central location. The selection of the
south side of the Terminal Public
Square as the location, with its
rather steep slopes to the Cuya-
hoga Valley involved heavy
expenditures for grading,
bridge construction,
and the building
of approaches,

due to the unfavorable topography which had been
responsible for the commercial under-development
of the area and its depreciating real estate values.
This condition enabled the Terminal Company to
purchase the land and the occupying structures at
a price which would have been prohibitive had the
site been occupied by modern buildings in an im-
portant district of the city. The relatively low cost
of the area selected compensate to a considerable
degree the expenditures for .heavy grading and the
building of the approaches with the further compen-
sation of obtaining a strategic location.
In the selection of the Public Square site there
immediately arose the serious problem of making
the station available for those railroads located in
the Cuyahoga Valley and consequently on a lower
level than the terminal. A more serious problem
was encountered in making the terminal facilities
accessible to the heaviest passenger carrier, the
New York Central Railroad, and further compli-
cated by the necessity for suitable connections for
the prospective tenancy of other railroads.
Cleveland is a junction point for most passenger
lines. It was necessary, therefore, to provide a sta-
tion of the through type with two approaches, one
following the east side of the valley to a connection
with the Nickle Plate at East 37th Street, and the
other crossing the north end of the valley on a
high viaduct, continuing through a shoulder in the
bluffs on the west side of the valley to West 25th
Street to connect with the Big Four and the Nickle
Plate where they enter the Walworth Run from
the west. These two approaches including the sta-
tion proper, having an aggregate length of three and
one-half miles, were constructed by, and comprise
the property of the Union Terminals Company. The
development of the approach lines outside the limits
of the terminal property involving extensive im-
provements in the way of additional trackage, grade
separation, etc., wras done by the Big Four, the
Xickle Plate, and the New York Central within the
limits of their rights-of-way which totaled about 17
miles. The work on this property between Collin-
wood and East One Hundred and Fifth Street, how-
ever, was planned and directed by the engineering
department of the Terminals Company.
The new station is of the through, two-level type
with all tracks on a lower level. Waiting rooms,
baggage, mail, express and other facilities are on
an upper level. However, with the exception of the
street entrances, the station facilities are essential-
ly all below street level. The arrangement can best
be explained by comparing the elevations of the
various units with the elevations of the streets.
The extension of Huron Road and Prospect Ave-
nue are at Elevation 100 where they pass over the
station concourse, while the street level at the
Public Square is at Elevation 85. The floors of the
concourse, ticket lobby, and other station facilities,
except the tracks, are at Elevation 72.5 or slightly
higher. Thus, the lobby or concourse floor is only
12.5 feet below the main entrance on the Square,
but 27.5 feet below the level of the streets which
cross over these facilities. There is ample head
room for minimum ceiling heights. The track plat-
forms are at Elevation 52.67 or 19.83 feet below the
concourse floor level. It is seen that the station
plan imposes no restriction on the use of any space
within the station area above the street level for
other than station use, except for such street front-
age and headroom as are necessary for adequate
entrances to the station facilities. Provision for a
main entrance has been effected in a way that pro-
vides the desired architectural emphasis, insures
adequate means of access and egress, and also
avoids interference with the utilization of the street
frontage for other purposes, namely, that of an en-
trance to a modern office building. This was ac-
complished by selecting the southwest corner of the
Public Square as the location of the dominant mass
for the architectural motif, the fifty-two story office
building with its seven hundred and eight foot
tower having a frontage of 160 feet on an east and
west line formed by cutting off the corner of the
square where the southeast and southwest lines in-
tersect. This east and west frontage is flanked by

penditures. The west approach required an exca-
vation of 425,000 cubic yards, the east approach,
1,340,000 cubic yards, and the station proper, 775,003
cubic yards, or a grand total of 2,540,000 cubic
yards. On the axis of the station, the original
ground surface sloped from Elevation 90 at the
Public Square to Elevation 33 at Canal Road, a
distance of 900 feet, the slope being more pre-
cipitous near the easterly end of the station area,
where the distance between the high level and the
low level streets is less. The entire area had to he
leveled to approximately Elevation 49, a task which
entailed a considerable excess of excavation over
embankment. As only 125,000 cubic yards were
required for embankment, it was necessary to dis-
pose of 95% of the excavation outside the limits of
the work. Where the operations could be reached
with track, the material could be disposed of by
train haul. Otherwise motor trucks were employed
with the contractor making his own arrangements
relative to disposal.
Because of the preponderance of cuts, special at-
tention was given to the matter of track drainage;
in addition to the generous depth of ballast pro-
vided, steps were taken to insure that water con-
fined in the road bed would be released. In each
side ditch and between the two inside tracks, eight
inch, perforated, corrugated, iron pipes were placed
in trenches backfilled with gravel or broken stone.
Man holes with grated top inlets were placed in the
drain lines at intervals of about 200 feet to provide
drainage in winter when the roadbed is frozen,
cleaning purposes and connections to the cross
drains of 12 inches, made of cast iron which cross
under the tracks to a longitudinal main sewer hav-
ing a minimum diameter of 15 inches.
Foundations and Footings
The difficulties and problems encountered in de-
ciding the type of footings and foundations of the
air-right buildings, the tests necessary before a
proper decision could be made, and the methods
used, are of considerable interest and value. Ex-
treme care was necessary in view of the great cost
of extending footings for the 52 story tower, 204
feet below rail level, to scrutinize every possibility
of founding the buildings at some shallower depth.
The necessity for this care is clearly shown by the
fact that the design of the air-right buildings over
the station area involved loads of as much as 5600
tons on a single 11 foot, 7 inch caisson. The large
overload of the tower was concentrated on an area
of about 100 square feet, and to accommodate the
railroad tracks this load had to be carried on but 16
columns.
To determine what load could be safely imposed
upon the bedrock, in case it was necessary to carry
the foundations down to rock, the following test
was made:
A piece of rock core, which was approximately
2 5/8ths inches in diameter and 1 l/4th inches deep,
was leveled up with rich cement mortar and
mounted in plaster of paris in a testing machine. A

What Shall I Read?
I la HI I in Garland's Roadside Meetings
By J. RALEIGH &gt;KI.M». Professor of English
THE reading of Hamlin Garland's latest book,
"Roadside Meetings," is an experience which
everyone who has any interest in the begin-
nings of our distinctly national literature should
give himself at the earliest possible moment. To
those whose active life was cast in the gay nine-
ties and early nineteen hundreds, it presents a com-
prehensive review of the interesting and often bril-
liant figures that were influential in those pio-
neering days in our American literature. For
those more nearly contemporary with the host of
present-day American realists who, especially in the
Midwest and West, have been so prolific in their
work in the past decade, Roadside Meetings should
provide a new appreciation of the origins of this
movement, which, while it is still
in the experimental stage, is al-
ready productive of some startling
results.
Hamlin Garland did not, of
course, originate the idea of an
American literature that should
be something beside a pale re-
flection of European models. Keen
observers of life with a passion
for truth were already experi-
menting with American material
—William Dean Howells, Edward
Eggleston, James Whitcomb
Riley, George Cable, Joaquin Mil-
ler, Bret Harte, Mark Twain, a promising vanguard.
But they had sprung spontaneously from their
native and local soils; they were more or less
sporadic; there was apparently no unifying, com-
mon purpose of which they were aware. Hamlin
Garland did much to make these ideals conscious
and articulate. As early as 1885, on the occasion
of his first interview with William Dean Howells,
he said in effect, "In my judgment the men and
women of the South, West, and East are all work-
ing, without know it. in accordance with a funda-
mental principle, which is this: American litera-
ture, in order to be great, must be national, and in
order to be national must deal with conditions pe-
culiar to our own land and climate. Every sin-
cere writer must write of the life he knows best
and for which he cares most. Thus, the stories of

Jewett, and Mary E. Wilkins, like the work of
Joaquin Miller and Bret Harte, are but varying
phases of the same movement, a movement which is
to give us at last a vital, original, and national lit-
erature."
With this prophetic vision and with the natural
aggressiveness of a reformer, Hamlin Garland made
contact with the various significant exponents of
this new national ideal. In Xew England there
were Sarah Orme Jewett, Mary Wilkins, Mrs. De-
land, John Burroughs, Walt Whitman, Thomas

Joaquin Miller. He came sooner
or later to know them all. And,
as he recognized in their work a
common characteristic, their ap-
preciation and use of local mate-
rial, he became the standard-
bearer of the movement toward
American realism.
Hamlin Garland was a keen ob-
server; he was finely sensitive to
impressions of every sort; he was
delicately analytic and discriminat-
ing; and his critical judgments,
though unquestionably affected by
his thesis, were usually well bal-
anced and dependable. Moreover, he was naturally
gifted with an accurate, vivid power of expression
which he developed until it became a definitely con-
scious technique that has made his books almost
photographic in detail. He was rarely well quali-
fied for the task he has set himself in this book. He
has looked back over a life in which he has had
some personal contact with almost every notable
personage of his time in letters and the arts, and
has given an impressionistic, brilliantly colored, gal-
lery of portraits of those he has know.n. In Boston,
in New York, in Washington, in Chicago, in the
press clubs, the studios, the artist groups of every
sort, he met the men whose names appear to us now
as lights marking our artistic progress as a people
His studies for his Life of General Grant led him to
cultivate the acquaintance of those who still lin-
gered from what he calls "The Vanishing Legion",

Research on Forge Heating
By W. E. .M»ll\ V. 'in 31. S. 411. E., American Gas Association
Research Engineer
ITH the idea of preparing to meet the
future needs of the forging industry,
in wrong dimensions of parts, or losses due to burn-
ing, or to the failure of machine units when burned
the Committee on Industrial Gas Re- steel has not been previously detected. The most
search of American Gas Association has been carry- important consideration in estimating the costs of
ing on a two-fold scientific investigation, the ulti- forging is the effect which the ease of working the
mate purpose of which is to develop a forging fur- metal has upon the rate of production. The tests at
nace superior to those types now commonly in use the University of Michigan would seem to indicate
which shall employ gas as a fuel. The investiga- that the forging is most easily accomplished by the
tion of the theoretical aspects of the problem was proper use of gas fuel. To appreciate fully the ex-
to be conducted in the laboratories of the University tent to which the ultimate costs may be reduced by
of Michigan, while the furnaces themselves were to
be developed by the Surface Combustion Company
of Toledo. The ^^^^^^^^^^-^^^^
present brief
article is in-
tended to give
some idea of
the lines along
which the in-
vestigations at
the University
of Michigan
were conduct-
ed.
The research
upon this proj-
ect is not yet
completed, but
the results thus
far obtained in-
dicate that gas
has many fa-
vorable charac-
teristics. Al-
though the
original cost for
gas fuel in most localities may be higher than that
of oil, yet the intelligent use of gas fuel should re-
sult in economies in the process of forging which
would lower the ultimate cost, and produce forg-
ings of higher quality.
The total cost of forge heating must, however, be
given careful consideration if gas fuel is to be suc-
increasing the rate of production, it would be well to
consider the actual costs frequently given by one of
— the larger forge
shops. These
are shown in
Table 1.
I n estimat-
ing the cost of
a forging, this
total is divided
by the number
which can be
forged per
hour. To this
cost will, of
course, be add-
ed the cost of
the steel.
It will be ob-
served that the
fuel cost is very
1 o w compared
to other costs,
r e p r e senting
only 4 per cent
of the total. If
by means of greater ease of forging, the rate of pro-
duction can be increased 10 per cent, there will be
a saving per hour of 61.5 cents. This means that
the fuel cost could be more than tripled without in-
creasing the total cost. If this increase in produc-
tion can be accomplished by the use of the cleaner,
more convenient gas fuel and the forgings produced

shop which are more dependent upon the manner The present research has led us to expect that gas

items include refractory costs, costs for the labor of

sary scrapping of parts when scaling has resulted

vorahle to the use of gas. He felt that since all he
wanted was heat in the metal he was forging, the
cheapest source of heat was, therefore, the best.
He did not believe that he needed any temperature
control other than could be obtained through the use
of his eye. He gave practically no consideration to
atmosphere control. The matter of decreasing the
scale formed on his steel did not seem important to
him and he accepted his high refractory costs as an
unfortunate necessity. If he had been correct in his
view of the case, the possibilities for gas would
have been very bad indeed. Its use would then
probably be limited to those few small installations
when the convenience of gas is the deciding factor.

called burning. Whenever steel is burned, it be-
comes excessively coarse-grained and brittle, and
its properties resemble those of cast-iron. This
phenomenon has always been troublesome to forge-
men but the}- have accepted it as a necessary evil
that resulted from forging at too high a tempera-
ture. Just what was meant by too high a tempera-
ture was a matter of uncertainty. Further, since all
plants produced some burned forgings, this diffi-
culty was accepted as something to be occasionally
expected. It remained for this research on the
forging program to show that the same steel might
burn at different temperatures, depending upon the
atmosphere of the furnace in which it was heated.
Some further surprising effects of atmosphere
were noted. It was found that at forging tempera-
tures under certain conditions steel might become
hotter than the furnace atmosphere in which it
was heated. This unexpected behavior of the steel
may be explained by the fact that the oxidation of
steel is accompanied by a liberation of heat. When
this oxidation occurs rapidly enough, heat is liber-
ated on the steel surface at a faster rate than it is
carried away by the surrounding atmosphere so that
the steel becomes hotter than the furnace atmo-
sphere.
This phenomenon occurs only in an atmosphere
containing free oxygen; the more free oxygen, the
lower the temperature at which it occurs. In an oil-
fired furnace, where the free oxygen content is usu-
ally quite large and the variations great, conditions
(Continued on page 36)
The first step in the investigation was to ascer-
tain if this view of the forge executive were entire-
ly correct. Tests were made to study the effect of
forging practice on the ultimate qualities of the
finished part made from the forging and on the costs
of fabrication following the forging. Important fac-
tors affecting the heating of forgings were found,
which indicate that fuel cost is far from being the
only determining factor affecting the cost of forge
heating. The tests showed that both the quality of
the finished part and the cost of fabrication follow-
ing the forging are very ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^=
vitally affected by the
method of forge heating.
The tests indicated that it
is possible to ruin a forg-
ing while it is in the
heating furnace and that
the injury may be entire-
ly on the inside so that no
type of plant inspection
can discover it and it re-
mains undiscovered un-
til the part fails in service.
This injury was found to
result from the effect of
the atmosphere in the
heating furnace and its
temperature. It is, there-
fore, apparent that con-
trol of both atmosphere
and temperature are high-
ly desirable in a forge
furnace.
The injury that results
from wrong atmosphere
and high temperature is FIG. 2. X-RAY EQUIPMENT USED IN STUDYING BURNED STEEL

Acoustics* Architecturally
The Physicist informs the Architect
By JOHN J. WHITE, '32A
MANY designers have found it desirable
from the point of view of design, to have
the ceiling represent the sky, giving a
large dome and with a dangerous radius of curva-
ture. If the ceiling be so designed that the curva-
ture over the large portion be greater than twice the
height from ceiling to floor and curve the periphery
be sharpened to less than one-half
this height the sky effect can still
be maintained and the great danger
of echo avoided.
A number of auditoria have been
built with parabolic ceilings or
parabolic surfaces to the rear of the
speaker. The parabola, functioning
under the same principle as the
emitting concentrated rays of heat
from an electric heater or rays of
light from a searchlight, sends out
sounds uniformly, parallel, and un-
diminished from the speaker. Such
reflectors of sound operate with the
same surprising efficiency as they do
when adapted to light or heat. Audi-
tors at considerable distance from the
speakers hear and understand easily. ===
The arrangement, however, has disadvantages in
some cases. The speaker is supposed to remain at
the focus of the parabola, thus forbidding any
marked moving about. It would not be suited for
use where many people are to be heard as in an
orchestra hall or theater, since only one performer
could be at the focus. Such a reflector would not be
suited for the usual stage arrangements with cur-
tains and stage scenery. Furthermore, any sound
originating in the room would tend to concentrate
at the focus and thus disturb the speaker. To pre-
vent the speaker's utterances being reflected back
to him as echoes, it would be necessary to install
highly sound-absorbing material at the rear of the
room so as to practically eliminate any reflection.
To have such a ceiling successful, it would appear
necessary to limit the performance to that of one
speaker at the focus, with the effective deadening
of rear walls. An interesting practical solution for
an auditorium which could be used
for large concerts has been worked
out in the Hill Auditorium where
the whole room, walls and ceiling
alike, forms a huge parabola and by
so doing dispenses with unhar-
monious reflecting surfaces.
The second and most frequent
phenomenon experienced today in
reverberation as has already been
noted, the prolongation of a sound
after its origin is completely damped.
It is generally known that the dense
fireproof materials used in modern
construction are conducive to poor
acoustical conditions and yet the
public demands sound control every-
where. So, often in the past, archi-
^^===^=^ tects have extended all their energies
in connection with design of an auditorium, exclud-
ing up any consideration of its acoustical proper-
ties, forgetting that an auditorium loses its utilitar-
ian value when the audiences cannot hear what is
spoken on the stage. Such practice is now hap-
pily being reduced by scientific study of such prob-
lems in our architectural institutions, so we can
hope for a long time when there will be no more
churches or auditoria built with beautiful archi-
tectural design and abdominal acoustic conditions.

AMERICA, and particularly its universities,
since the World War have shown intense
interest in the history of the ancient civili-
zation of the time of Christ, but until the last two
years that interest was of an inactive and unor-
ganized nature. The investigations of French and
British archaeologists had been long looked upon
with great envy and longing by American explor-
ers who had already uncovered practically every-
thing of importance relating to past civilization on
this continent. Foreign scientists, sensing this atti-
tude and realizing the advantage of American finan-
cial aid, have sought co-operation with Yale and
Princeton archaeology departments. This has re-
sulted in the entrance of America upon a quest
which may substantially alter historical background
as at present established and accepted.
Professors M. I. Rostovtzeff and Everet P. Meeks
are the men most responsible for our participation
in the excavation now in progress in the Near East.

activity has not here been terminated. A large

From information gleaned by these excavations,

Biblical associations. Gerasa was also a great Ro-
man military station, being occupied throughout the

of the Jews. Excavated tablets supply informa-
tion that during uprisings the Roman Empire used
this city as a recruiting base and general head-
quarters in the suppression of Jewish revolts.

found in the ruins of this once-famous city pro-
vide much information of its government, cus-
toms, and its life. The findings, in addition, reveal
much of literary worth and have gone far to pagen-

How Long A Time Shall I Spend In College?
The question of the number of years that a stu-
dent should spend in taking; a course in engineering
has been the subject of many debates and discus-
sions. Four, five, and six years have been advo-
cated at various times, and in one or two instances
the six-year course has actually been put into ef-
fect, with, however, somewhat unfortunate results.
If engineering schools and colleges were con-
cerned solely with educating the purely professional
type of engineer, similar to the doctor, lawyer, or
dentist, the problem would be somewhat simplified,
and I think that no one would gainsay the argu-
ment that the training required should come under
the same category. Engineering colleges have,
however, at least two more functions to perform to-
day; first, to fulfill the demands of industry gen-
erally, which, while requiring a fundamentally
sound training in engineering, would not demand a
highly trained specialist or designer, and second, the
type of man capable of taking up research prob-
lems.
Some other factors also enter into the problem.
A good many of the larger industries have now es-
tablished regular post-graduate training courses, in
which the student not only gains some practical ex-
perience, but also is required to attend lectures and
take examinations. It is obvious, therefore, that if
an engineering course were laid out to fill specifical-
ly the requirements of any one of these conditions,
it would not of necessity be the most desirable for
the others.
In recent years two considerations have been par-
ticularly emphasized in connection with engineering
curricula; first, that it should include more work of
a broadening character such as Economics, Finance,
Language, History, etc., than formerly, and sec-
ond, that emphasis should be placed on a thorough
grounding in the fundamental sciences rather than
devoting too much time to detailed applications.
The four-year course seems to have become an
established institution in this country .and may be
regarded as the normal period for training in the
fundamentals of higher education. It forms either
the foundation on which advanced and specialized
work may be built, or a basis for the life's work for
many who do not desire to take up a profession.
In connection with engineering it would there-
fore appear desirable that a normal four-year un-
dergraduate course would be a logical solution, and
this should be of a type in which too much speciali-
zation is not attempted. For those who wish to be-
come professional engineers, particularly in those
cases where post-graduate work is not available
elsewhere, one or two additional years, and in some
cases even more for a doctor's degree, might prop-
erly be spent in an intensive study of a specialized
field.
There is also the type of "combined" course, par-
ticularly in what is called by various names such
as "Industrial" or "Management" Engineering.
Here the problem is somewhat different in that in
the first place the student should have a real engi-
neering course, and also combine with this what
amounts to another undergraduate course in busi-
ness administration. There is no particularly ad-
vanced or specialized work, but the whole repre-
sents a more broadly trained man for industry gen-
erally. Such a course cannot possibly be given sat-
isfactorily in less than five years, otherwise the
training in both classes of work would be inade-
quate.
The question of the degree for such work some-
times worries the prospective student, in that he
feels that if he receives only a Bachelor's degree for
five years' work, he is somewhat at a disadvantage,
as compared with a man who has pursued a fifth


Page Fifteen

year in some speciality and received a Master's de-
gree. I think that he need not worry on that score,
because it is not the actual degree that counts with
an employer, but rather the type and thoroughness
of the work pursued during the training period.
There are, therefore, at least three possible stop-
ping points so far as college work is concerned, de-
pending largely on what a man may decide to do.
Financial questions often set the limit at four
years, but it by no means follows that the educa-
tional period should stop at this point, even if not
carried on a Campus. There are advantages in pur-
suing work under instruction, but if this is not pos-
sible, a man with initiative and determination can
certainly continue to build a good superstructure if
the foundation has been well laid. We are, how-
ever, rapidly approaching the time when there is an
increasing demand for specialization, and if so, a
longer period than that of the customary four years
would seem advisable, at any rate, for a number
of men.
The Frontispiece
The frontispiece this month is an excellent
pencil sketch by Roland E. Wilson, '32A. It de-
picts two of Chicago's most imposing buildings,
namely, the Wrigley Building and the Tribune
tower. Both of these structures are situated on the
world famous \Vacker Drive. Mr. Wilson has long
been interested in the sketching of large buildings
and the majority of these are of the acute angle
type. Aside from this very interesting hobby of
his, he has been in the employ of Pond and Pond,
the celebrated Chicago architectural firm, during
the recent summer months. This is not the first
contribution which this magazine has received from
Mr. Wilson, inasmuch as we were extremely fortu-
nate in having his sketch of the Bell Building of
Chicago as the frontispiece for the last December
issue. It is the Technic's earnest hope that Mr.
Wilson will continue to contribute more of his ex-
cellent work in the future.
Debating Society Room
There has been a great deal of discussion among
the students in regard to the conversion of the old
Engineering Society room into a reference room
for the Debating Society. It has been the topic of
heated arguments among those who used this room
for smoking or "bull sessions" and members of the
Debating Society. At the last meeting of the En-
gineering Council, representative students govern-
ing body, the Dean and the Council reviewed the
situation from a non-partisan standpoint. It was
the understanding that the present arrangement
was merely an experiment and that if the room was
not used more efficiently as a reference room than
it had been used previously as a smoking and loung-
ing room it would again be reconverted into a
smoking room. In the mean time, unless a smoking
room is found, the devotees of the weed will suffer
for the advancement of scientific research and ex-
perimentation. A suggestion has been made that
benches be placed on the first floor in the vicinity
of the former automotive display and that smoking
be allowed, but as yet nothing definite seems to
have been decided.
It would appear that there is a question in the
mind of the powers that direct the curriculum as
to whether it is more desirable to be able to "light a
Murad" when confronted by a difficult or em-
barrassing situation or mount the rostrum and de-
fend the Engineer's decision and viewpoint in the
manner of a true Websterite.
Our Contributors
This month we are happy to welcome Captain
Paul R. Guthrie as one of our contributors. The
Cleveland Terminal is one of the most outstanding
achievements in terminal design that has been com-
pleted in recent years. Captain Guthrie for the last
two years has been detailed to the Reserve Quarter-
master Corps at Cleveland as an instructor. It was
during this time that the Cleveland Terminal was
conceived and constructed. Many of the different
problems that had to be met, are discussed from
original observation in this article. This year Cap-
tain Guthrie has been detailed to Michigan as a
Graduate student in Transportation.
The problem of forge heating and furnaces has
been for a long time a perplexing problem to in-
dustry. Mr. Jominey, this month, tells us of the ac-
complishments that are being made in that field by
the American Gas Association. The author ob-
tained his Master's degree from Michigan in 1916.
He is, now, a Research Engineer for the American
Gas Association, who are conducting investigations
at Michigan.
Honor Societies
Several of the honor societies have recently held
their fall elections and the men chosen are supposed
to represent the elite of the Senior class, exclusive
of the men who were elected last spring
In our opinion some of the so-called "honor so-
cieties" on this campus are scarcely more than po-
litical cliques and the student body would suffer not
a particle by the abolition of such groups. Some
other organizations do little more than elect, either
once or twice each year and give a banquet for their
new members.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
COLLEGE NOTES
Professor James Harlan Cissel
Just the sort of material that brings joy to the
heart of civic improvement workers is Professor
James Harlan Cissel. Somehow we simply cannot
picture him refusing to help out in anything that
he is asked to do. He is too good natured and en-
thusiastic, too much interested in people other than
himself, and too much of a good fellow. That is
why he is one of the most popular members of the
Engineering College faculty.
Professor Cissel was born in Kansas, but soon
moved to Indiana, where he went to primary schools
and finally to Purdue University .
to secure his B.S. in Civil Engi-
neering in 1910. Upon gradua-
tion he drifted westward and was
employed as a draftsman in the
bridge department of the Kansas
City Terminal Railway. Three
years later he spent a year with
the Santa Fe Lines in Los An-
geles. Another year of design
work in Kansas City anticipated
his coming to Michigan to accept
an instructorship in Civil Engi-
neering. From 1915 on he has
been connected with the Univer-
sity and is now Professor of
Structural Engineering.
In the meantime the projects
that he has seen service with in
his professional engagements
form a very imposing list, among
which are appraisals of the De-
troit Edison Co., the Consumers
Power Co., various Michigan and
out-of-state railroads, and bridge
designs for Wayne County, Ann
Arbor, and Lansing. Our eye is particularly caught
by mention of an alternate design of a 1640 foot
bridge at Sydney, Australia, for Sir William Arrol
and Sons of Edinburgh.
Professor Cissel's particular complex seems to be
a capacity for doing everything. He has been di-
PROF. J. H. CISSEL
rector of the Ann Arbor Community Fund Associa-
tion, and county chairman of the Washtenaw Coun-
ty chapter of the American Red Cross, not to men-
tion the other civic activities that he interests him-
self in. Professionally he is a member of the Amer-
ican Society of Civil Engineers, the American Con-
crete Institute, and the Society for the Promotion of
Engineering Education. And he is very active in
his capacity of alumnus advisor to the local chapter
of his fraternity, Theta Chi.
Some students seem to believe that the faculty as
. a body are devoid of any human
qualities, and should be dis-
missed as classroom figure-heads.
Nothing is more absurd. We say
that because we have in mind an
occasion when we listened in on
some students talking about
their instructors. Came Profes-
sor Cissel's turn, and someone
who had been standing around
broke into a smile. We quote:
"The other day I was standing
down in the Arch and someone
swaggered by with a grin a mile
long on his face and whistling
like a lark. Yeah, it was Cis-
sel."
Engineering Council
Dean H. C. Sadler justified his
action in turning the Engineer-
ing Socity smoking room over to
Sigma Rho Tau and added that
attempts are being made to find
a new smoking room for the fum-
ing engineers.
At the last meeting of the engineering council
Dean Sadler said: "The debating society, with its
rapid growth had found need of a reference room
where clippings and magazines could be filed,
speeches compiled, and still be near the library.
The Engineering Society's room was the only such


Page Seventeen
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
room available." The council decided that the move
was satisfactory and that the room would probably
be put to much better use by the stump speakers.
The matter of introducing technical moving pic-
tures for engineering students was also taken up by
the council and the Dean offered to personally pay
any transportation expenses that would be incurred
by getting these films.
A. B. Evans was unanimously elected as
chairman of the coun-
cil. Mr. Zara of the In-
dustrial Engineers was
appointed to look into
the matter of obtaining
the moving pictures.

University Tests Guard
Rail
Michigan highway en-
gineers have long sought
some sort of means to
prevent motorists from
running off the embank-
ments on curves in the
roadway. Solid, immov-
able embankments are
impracticable from the
standpoint of expense
and damaging character-
istics, according to F. N.
Menefee, Professor of
Engineering Mechanics
in the University of
Michigan, in charge of
the University Mate-
rials Testing Labora-
tory. Light railing
which merely invites the
motorist's attention to
the danger but does not
offer resistance seems to
be not only valueless
but is full of potential
dangers. Wooden rails
easily splinter, and the
records are full of cases where splintered rails or
planks have pierced the sides of cars injuring or
killing the occupants.
The steel cable has been used in Michigan for
several years with greater success than other forms
of rail. The cable is tough and strong, yet flexible.
A 3,000 pound car at 30 miles an hour contains
about 90,500 foot-pounds of energy. This energy
must be used up before the cars will come to a stop.
The steel cables used by the State of Michigan are
required to withstand at least 15,000 pounds of ten-
sion before they break. Being flexible and mounted
on posts which have some flexibility and which
In the
Spotlight
PAUL S. BIGBY
Ye do gaze, gentle readers,
upon the noble features of one
Paul S. Bigby, student, keen
and vigorous son of the golden
West. Paul hails from way
out in Denver, Colorado, and
candidly admits that the picture flatters him immensely—•
even though he has some natural attributes. We ex-
pect a host of sweetly scented letters flooding the office
after this issue comes out; letters about autographed
photographs, but we shall steel ourselves to the occasion.
Not one letter shall pass!
Before he came to Michigan, Bigby spent several years
at the University of Denver, where he was a Lambda
Chi. He has been an independent man since he has been
on our campus and it was on this ticket that he became
President of the Senior Class. Class activities had inter-
ested him for some time, but it was not until this fall
that he really came into class prominence. His political
strength was quite a surprise to the opposing parties and
he won the class election by a decided majority.
Paul's scholarly interest is mostly in mechanical en-
gineering and at the present time he is spending much
of his time working on the new di-phenol steam generat-
ing plant which is being developed by the chemistry and
mechanical engineering departments. He also helped with
some work on motor fuels for Professor G. G. Brown.
A.S.M.E. has claimed him as an active member for
some years. Paul wears the insignia of Vulcans, honor-
ary scholastic and activities fraternity, into which he was
recently initiated. He is also a member of the Engi-
neering Council, a group which is more important than
many of us suspect, so his good judgment should be an
asset to his fellow classmates.
Activities should not be the sole measure of a man's
attainment while he is attending a university. We have
in Bigby, a young man who is primarily interested in an
education, a man who has a nice discernment about the
balance between key hunting and intelligent pursuit of
knowledge. He is an individual who has just about the
right amount of modesty to make him likeable and he
has enough self-confidence to make it progressive.
in turn are set in the ground, which by yielding per-
mits them to absorb shock without breaking, the
energy of the moving car is largely spent in over-
coming these yielding resistances.
The energy of the car could be absorbed if the
cable could pull its anchor 6 feet with a force of
15,000 pounds. This might mean pulling a few
posts out of the ground or breaking them off, but
while this destruction was taking place the car
would be slowing down.
The yielding resistance
is the quality which
makes this type of road
guard so much to be
preferred to others.
In buying this cable
the State specifies 'that
it must have a tensile
strength of at least
15,000 pounds, and in
order to determine
whether it meets speci-
fications a six foot
length is cut from every
so many feet and sent to
the University for test-
ing.
Here the cable is cut
in two places and the in-
dividual wires in each
end are spread apart
and turned back on
themselves in a hollow
cone-shaped type of
grip which is filled with
molten zinc to prevent
its slipping out. The
prepared specimen is
then put in a testing
machine and gradually
loaded to destruction
and the load at break-
ing carefully noted. If
the cable does not with-
stand fifteen thousand
pounds the shipment may be rejected.
, Engineering Law
The engineering-law course has gained consider-
able impetus since its introduction about a year ago
and at the present time there are eight of our stu-
dents enrolled in its curriculum. Three years are
spent in the College of Engineering and three years
in the Law School. The second year men are: C. R.
Holly, E. L. Neumann, and W. S. Pocock. Three
engineers are also in the third year of the course:
G. H. Knowles, A. W. Lipphart, and C. G. Staelin.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
ALUMNI NEWS
C. II. Km*rows
The graduates of the Engineering College of the
University of Michigan represent one of the most
cosmopolitan groups of alumni in the world. Their
ranks are filled by men from every state in the
union and from practically every nation on the face
of the globe. The various departments of speciali-
zation to which the several individuals who make
up this large alumni group have
dedicated themselves range
through the entire scale of en-
gineering professions. We
have recounted upon these
pages the accomplishments of
outstanding men in all of the
better known fields of engi-
neering. Now, in order to
bring out the unavoidable fact
that Michigan's engineers are
among the most advanced in
their respective professions, let
us consider the work of C. R.
Burrows, a graduate of elec-
trical engineering whose inter-
est in radio has led him into re-
search work in that field.
During the early months of
the summer of 1923, while he
was still enrolled as a junior in
the Engineering College of the
University of Michigan, Mr.
Burrows became interested in the work of the Bell
Telephone Company on the development of a long
wave transatlantic radio transmitter. Born with
an ultra-scientific mind and an especial interest in
electrical phenomena, Mr. Burrows had early
made radio his hobby, a hobby which so absorbed
the waking moments of this extraordinary young
college student that it had become almost a pas-
sion. In order to satisfy his curiosity and satiate
his thirst for knowledge, Mr. Burrows applied for
and received a summer position with the Bell Tele-
phone Research Laboratories at Rocky Point.
C. R. BURROWS
Throughout the summer of this year he worked
there helping with the designing and testing of long
distance radio-telephone transmitters. He returned
for his final year in college with the idea firmly
fixed in his mind that he would dedicate his life
work to radio and radio-telephone research.
Upon receiving his degree of Bachelor of Science
in Electrical Engineering in
June, 1924, Mr. Burrows, re-
turned to the Bell Laboratories
in New York and Rocky Point
and undertook the design of a
test oscillator for the Rugby
long wave transmitter. While
working with his customary
energy on this difficult assign-
ment, he made certain experi-
mental discoveries which con-
vinced him that the short
wave transmitter, if means of
satisfactorily controlling it
could be found, was the ideal
type for long distance com-
munication. Following out this
idea, then, he began his pres-
ent day association with short
wave radio development by in-
tensive work attempting to find
ways and means of controlling
short wave broadcasts.
One of his most notable and most recent achieve-
ments has been the study of the difficulties in the
way of radio-telephone communication between
North and South America. To ensure the best pos-
sible telephone service between these two conti-
nents, it was necessary to precede the recent open-
ing of the line with a survey of transmission con-
ditions over the contemplated path. The results
of this survey was carried out by Mr. Burrows and
a picked squad of radio engineers, have made pos-
sible, the present satisfactory telephone service be-

STEPPING INTO A MODERN WORLD
Scientist and Salesman
THE MODERN PARTNERSHIP
Like every other modern industry, the Bell
System requires the combined effort of scien-
tist and salesman. The commercial man has
again and again shown the public how to use
new products of the telephone laboratory,
and how to make new uses of existing
apparatus.
Transmitting pictures and typewritten mes-
sages over telephone wires are services right
now being actively promoted. Scientific selling
by long distance is among many ideas origi-
nated to increase the telephone's usefulness.
In short telephony is a business, with prob-
lems that stimulate commercially minded men
and a breadth of opportunity in step with the
fast moving world of industry today.

tween New York and the Argentine. These experi-
ments brought out many vital factors which had
to be taken into consideration in building up the
transmission and receiving systems. One of the
most important of these was the plotting of the
"skip distances". In the "skip region", according
to present day theory, the radio signal is not re-
ceived because there are not sufficient electrons in
the upper atmosphere to reflect the wave back to
the earth. There is a point, however, the terminus
of the "skip region", where these waves do return
to earth. The distance between the source of the
waves and this returning point is known as the
skip distance for the given frequency of wave used
in determining the observations. This skip distance
also varies with the various zones of temperature
and the density of the air.
Because of the ionizing effects of the sun upon
the atmosphere, the strength of the radio signals
and the lengths of the skip distances vary also with
the time of day or night at which the broadcasts
are made. The seasonal effects of the sun, how-
ever, do not have to be taken into consideration
since Buenos Aires and New York are about equal-
ly distant south and north of the equator and the
seasons are exactly opposite.
Mr. Burrows conducted experimental observa-
tions through the better part of two years in de-
termining the effects of these various factors upon •
short wave transmission over this route. His fig-
ures were then charted and the graphs thus ob-
tained were used in plotting a frequency scale for
the radio transmission. The purpose of this scale
was to determine the changes in frequency neces-
sary to keep the skip distances constant as the
changes in time and atmospheric conditions
fluctuated. The frequency was thus adjusted so as
to keep the skip distance at that certain length
which would provide the strongest signals at the re-
ceiving end of the system.
Mr. Burrows' computations were so accurate and
his work was so highly successful that he has re-
ceived the commendation of scientists all over the
nation. Columbia University has honored him with
a Master's degree in Physics and the people of both
North and South America are profiting greatly
through his genius. The University of Michigan,
has, indeed, just reason to be proud of this one of
her graduates who has gained outstanding success
in one of the newest branches of electrical engineer-
ing, radio- telephony.

Bonnet Carre spillway is being completed. In
times of high water this concrete dam on the
east bank of the Mississippi will tap the flood

ing talent which contributed to its development and the thorough-
going methods employed in its construction.
The compressor station at Reform, Alabama, is Worthington-equipped
with four 1250 hp. 24" x 36" twin-tandem gas-engine-driven com-
pressors. This equipment was installed by A. M. Lockett &amp; Company
under contract from Ford, Bacon &amp; Davis, supervisory engineers for the
original line. An additional unit has just been ordered for this station.
The new station at Pickens, Mississippi, will be equipped with five
Worthington 1250 hp. units of the same type as those at Reform.
These will be installed by A. M. Lockett &amp; Company, under the super-
vision of P. McDonald Biddison, Consulting Engineer for the South-
ern Natural Gas Corporation.
More than 50% of the gas-engine-driven gas compressors now in
service are Worthingtons. For information, communicate with the

ACOUSTICS
(Continued from page 12)
T is the time of one reverberation, K is the constant
.05, V is total volume of the room and A is the total
number of absorption units present, works very well
for determining reverberation in most cases. By
this we see that with constant absorption and with
enlarging volume, the greater will be the time of
reverberation. In auditorium design, therefore,
while the volume of the room is fairly definitely
fixed due to architectural necessities, the absorption
may be varied to bring about the proper duration
of sound after its generation has been completely
damped. If conditions permit, heavily knapped
carpets, upholstered seats, and draperies may be
combined advantageously to assist sound deaden-
ing. Sometimes these fixtures are not feasible or
sufficient, in which case special sound absorption
material is resorted to in order to prevent reverbera-
tion or echoes. The use of cork has come into wide
use especially for swimming pool rooms and gym-
nasiums as at the Intramural Sports Building where
it also serves as an insulation material to hold the
heat in the room.
With every new development in science, there
comes a need for suitable design of construction
and as a result new problems in acoustics present
themselves. The importance of acoustics today
asserts itself when we see it is not only confined to
the auditorium, but it has been extended to include
courtrooms, business offices, restaurants, hospitals,
gymnasia, swimming pools, libraries and the talking
movie theatres. Truly the growing importance of
acoustics in modern design warrants an ever-in-
creasing study of the subject by the architect.

Such situations as these are intolerable. Either
the student body will forget that such organizations
exist or it will regard them with derision and scorn.
Such organizations should either choose men who
truly represent the ideals of the society; men who
will reflect credit on the group and who will make
themselves and their leadership felt on the campus,
or they should disband and return their charters to
their respective national headquarters.
One honor fraternity has already done that and
two others are contemplating doing it. Certain
others could and should do the same thing.
When an honor society really lives up to the high
ideals set forth in its constitution, it is indeed an
honor to be elected to the society. But when mem-
bership means little more than the privilege to wear
another key, it is a waste of time and money to be-
long to it.

Attention Engineers!
Professor Swinton has given us a tip that should
prove valuable to a great many of the graduating
engineers. This tip is that the State Board exam-
inations for civil, mechanical, chemical, architect-
ural, and highway engineers will be given in Ann
Arbor and East Lansing on the last three days of
December; they will also be given again at a later
time in June, just before Commencement.
Mr. Swinton advises that all students who con-
template becoming registered engineers take the
first two parts of the exams while they still retain
the knowledge of mathematics, mechanics, hydrau-
lics, etc. He states that these are the subjects
which are most often forgotten by engineers who
wait until they have had their two years of prac-
tical work before they take the examinations. By
taking the two parts of the exams on technical sub-
jects now and finishing the last part on practical
problems after having the experience back of him,
the engineering student greatly facilitates himself.
The reason why more of this is not done is prob-
ably due to the fact that this proposed arrangement
is not known to a great many of our students.
He: "Do you know the secret of popularity?"
She: "Yes, but mother says I mustn't."

MODERN INDUSTRY ROLLS
ON TIMKENS
High speed ... swift motion ... the advance of a mechanical age carries a constant
threat in built-up friction. But Industry has found a safe defense—Timken Tapered
Roller Bearings.
Engineers of former years have left a heritage to the student engineers of today—a
heritage of anti-friction protection for all types of mechanical equipment.
Thirty years ago and more, Timken introduced the tapered principle of construction,
based upon the ever-present twin loads—radial and thrust. The intervening period has
served to emphasize the correctness of Timken design.
Thus Timken tapered construction, Timken positively aligned rolls and Timken-made
steel are guardians of power ... savers of lubricant... life preservers for machinery.
In modern construction equipment, in huge steel rolling mills, in machine tools, in
motor cars, trucks and tractors, in railroad trains, in airplanes, in all machinery—every
mechanical movement finds a Timken Bearing made with utmost precision to fill every
modern anti-friction need.
Every advance that Industry makes sees the Timken total grow, while the cost of
power, lubrication and maintenance knocks the bottom out of all former levels. The

Greater Production Economies
through Automatic Milling
A LARGE number of production milling
jobs fall into a class readily adaptable to
automatic milling.
For such work.—the production of dupli-
cate inter-changeable parts.—Brown &amp; Sharpe
No. 21 Automatic offers unusual production
possibilities.
Several types of automatic operation are avail-
able. When fully automatic, once the machine
is set for a job the operator has only to load
and unload the fixtures; the functioning of
the table and spindle being automatically con-
trolled by adjustable dogs on the front of
the saddle.
The set-up shown above is designed for the
manufacture of electrical equipment and in
addition to securing increased production and
better quality of work, has greatly simplified
the method of milling.

pressure reached 4500 pounds per square inch at
which time a slight hair crack appeared on one
side. The load was increased until it reached 6500
pounds per square inch when a second small crack-
appeared on the opposite side of the first crack on
the specimen. No further change occurred under
additional pressure until the load reached 7100
pounds per square inch, at which time the second
crack opened up slightly. There was no change up
to 7600 pounds per square inch when the crack
opened up further. At 7700 pounds the top of the
specimen began to crack. The test was terminated
at this point to save the specimen. The load of 4500
pounds per square inch at which the first crack ap-
peared, is equivalent to 316 tons per square foot.
Allowing for differences between the actual condi-
tion of the foundation rock in place and the speci-
men tested, it was determined that a bearing pres-
sure of 100 tons per square foot was perfectly safe.
The bottoms of the piers that rested on clay were
designed with bells consisting of truncated cones
with their surfaces sloped two to one. The tower
foundations carry loads varying from 3150 tons to
4450 tons and are from 6 feet 8 inches, to 10 feet
4 inches in diameter. In designing the felled, cyl-
indrical piers, resting on clay, the total load to be
supported was assumed to be the weight of the su-
perstructure, the pier and the bell; the supporting
items were the skin friction of the sides of the
pier shaft, at 350 pounds per square foot, and the
sustaining power of the clay beneath the bells. This
latter was dependent upon the quality of the ma-
terial and its distance from the surface of the
ground. The allowable soil pressure beneath the
bells at the depths to which the foundations were
carried, was finally fixed at 5J/2 tons per square foot
with an alternate limit of 7l/2 tons per square foot,
providing skin friction was ignored. No shaft less
than 4 feet in diameter was used because of the
difficulty in excavating one of smaller diameter;
and where the unit stress in the concrete of a 4
foot shaft was 400 pounds per square inch or less,
the pier below the hooped reinforcing was made of
concrete having about a 1 :2:4 mix.
By the use of high strength concrete for piers, a
higher unit bearing pressure was secured between
the steel billets under the building columns and the
tops of the piers. The result was a reduction in the
amount of pier concrete and foundation excavation
as well as in the dimensions of the bearing billets
making them more easily handled.
Alternate designs were prepared for the 16
foundations supporting the tower, first on the basis
of bearing values outlined for a deep well founda-
tion resting on clay at elevation -83.0; and second
for cylindrical concrete piers extending to bedrock,
designed for unit stress of 750 pounds per square

BULK MATERIAL
Penny-saving is the order of the day in modern
industry. Manufacturers are cutting their costs
—cutting them from the very beginning—and
the savings come on down to the consumer.
Much of the saving is in the handling of bulk
material. Right at the mine, the cost of iron
and steel is reduced by mechanical handling of
the iron ore. Loading and unloading of cars and
even boats is now done by machinery instead of

by slow and costly human labor. A fraction of a
cent a ton saved in the cost of handling the coal
burned in the factory may mean thousands of
dollars by the end of the year—and a radical
difference in the price which the consumer pays
for the finished product or for light and heat.
Rex Bulk Handling Equipment is doing its
share in reducing costs. In every part of the
country, in mine, mill and factory, Rex Equip-
ment is at work, handling cement, stone, sand,

DYNAMITE clears the way for modern engineering wonders!
New York Central used
DYNAMITE
to widen its main line front,
Si or 111 King to 31 a nil on!
THE task of clearing the way
for additional tracks on the
main line of a busy system seems
an almost impossible undertak-
ing. And yet the New York Cen-
tral Railroad did it.
From Storm King to Manitou,
New York ... a distance of
nearly 15 miles . . . new tunnels
driven, old ones enlarged, ledges
of rock, from 60 to 90 feet high,
removed—while 125 trains per
day sped by within a few feet of
the operations!
Without dynamite such a feat
would have been practically im-
possible. With the help of du Pont
Explosives, the job of excavating
900,000 cubic yards of rock went
through and this famous rail-
road improved its passenger and
freight service!
What a part dynamite plays in
modern life! It breaks ground
for towering skyscrapers. It
builds tunnels. It aids in the
construction of bridges, roads,
dams, subways. It digs coal,
quarries roc-k . . . unearths raw
materials that go into the mak-
ing of a thousand and one every-
day products.
No engineer of tomorrow can
afford not to know all there is to
know about this valuable tool
. . . dynamite. You have a
chance to learn more about ex-
plosives and how to use them
. . . now . . . while you're still in
college.
All you need to do is to write
the du Pont Company for a copy
of the Blasters' Handbook. This
book contains a wealth of infor-
mation about explosives—infor-
mation gathered by du Pont in
128 years' experience in making
and improving explosives. So
valuable is this book ... so com
pact and handy ... it is used in
the classrooms and dormitories of
many of the leading technical in-
stitutions. Your free copy is

inch at the plane of the bottom of the hooped rein-
forcing. In the second design, skin friction was
ignored and no attempt was made to determine how
the pressure from the soil and piers might he dis-
tributed to the rock.
Bids were submitted for both designs. While the
bids for the first design, terminating the shafts with
bells at elevation -83.0, were considerably lower,
the management of the Terminals Building Com-
pany decided that complete safety and the result-
ant moral effect on the tenants justified the addi-
tional expenditure of carrying the foundations to
rock, approximately at elevation -155.0, a total
depth of 204 feet.
The Track Layout
The track layout at the station calls for an ulti-
mate development of 34 tracks, the first ten at the
north to be used by the rapid-transit trains, and the
rest by steam railway trains. In the initial develop-
ment, the four most northerly traction tracks have
been omitted, while the steam concourse as it is now
constructed, with its south wall temporarily on the
north line of Huron Road extension, is provided
with stairways to six track platforms, namely, those
served by tracks No. 11 to 22 inclusive. But pro-
vision has been made in the plan permitting the
eventual extension of'the concourse to the south of
the tracks No. 23 to 34 inclusive may also be used
for steam road service. At present, track No. 23
serves as a running track, while the space to the
south of it has been developed as a nine track coach
yard.
Although the steam and the traction tracks are at
the same level, the two groups of tracks are entire-
ly independent there being no cross-over connection
between them. The two sets of tracks differ also in
that all of the traction tracks will be spaced from
33 to 34}/2 feet apart in order to provide a platform
on each side of each track, while the steam railway
tracks conform to the common paired arrangement
with the platforms between pairs of tracks. The
track centers across the platforms being 28.79 feet
to 29 feet except where the curves at each end of
the station necessitate a narrower spacing.
All the tracks connect with each approach ex-
cept the three most northerly traction tracks which
will connect only with the east approach. The
platforms serving the traction tracks range from 261
to 712 feet in length, and those serving the steam
tracks from 1,193 feet to 1.511 feet.
All main tracks in the station and the approaches
are laid with 127 pound Dudley section rail and
those in the coach yard with 105 pound relayer rail.
Approach tracks are laid with 7 inch by 9 inch by
8j^ feet ties on 12 inch rock ballast, and 24 inch
sub-ballast, which is granulated slag in the west
approach and crushed slag in the east.

Interlocking and Communication Facilities
The outstanding feature of the interlocking fa-
cilities at the Terminal is that all of the switches and
signals or tracks used by the steam roads through-
out the four miles of Terminal property are con-
trolled from one interlocking machine having 576
levels. Not only is this the largest single interlock-
ing ever installed but it also embodies a number
of features and refinements in design which mark a
forward step in the evolution of power interlocking.
The signal station, a structure 144 feet long and 17
feet wide, is located near the east throat of the sta-
tion track layout.
These refinements, resulting in the simplification
and the speeding up of operation, are the elimina-
tion of locked rods for the interlocked switches, the
elimination of indication locking, and a new type
color-light dwarf signal which provides a fourth in-
dication to be used when desiring to close up two
trains on one track.
A teletype communication system has been in-
stalled for handling train announcing and coach
movement orders. The installation consists of
two sending-receiving and 14 receiving-only tape
teletypes. The sending-receiving machines are lo-
cated in the telegraph office and the signal tower,
while the receiving-only instruments are at the tele-
phone information board, the Pullman reservation
desk, the ticket office, the information booth, the
west-end yardmaster's office, the east-end yardmas-
ter's office, the crew dispatcher's office, the bulletin
board, the baggage agent's office, the sub-foreman's
office, the station master's office, the express office,
and the mail room. Messages are transmitted si-
multaneously to all the receiving stations from one
of the two sending points; the second sending ma-
chines making a copy of the transmitted message.
Train movements on the entire terminal area, a
district 25 miles long, are directed by a dispatcher
located in the station. A Western Electric alternat-
ing current selector board with connections with
30 stations is provided for this service, 18 of these
stations being located on the track platform of the
station and the remainder in stations and inter-
locking towers at various points on the lines ap-
proaching the connections to the terminal track.
A color light signal system provides intercommu-
nication between the gateman in the concourse, the
conductor on the station platform below, and the
tower man, the purpose of which is to enable trains
to get started quickly when all passengers are
aboard. _,, .-

HOW HERCULES EXPLOSIVES ADVANCE CIVILIZATION
EXPLOSIVES
Bring the oil fields to you
WHEN you drive up to a nearby filling station fo-
a supply of gasoline, you are utilizing the mighty
force of explosives in our civilization. For, in locating
structures, "shooting in" wells, and laying distributing
lines, explosives help to bring the oil fields to you.
Yesterday, "oil was where you found it." Today, seismic
methods of geophysical prospecting enable the modern
geologist to locate favorable structures with reason-
able accuracy. How? Explosives initiate earth vibrations
which, when recorded, enable the geologist to chart
structures.
Thus explosives, long used to "bring in" oil wells and
to aid in pipe line construction, are finding another im-
portant application in the petroleum industry—another
indication that explosives are helping us to enjoy a
richer,fuller civilization. In these achievements, Hercules
explosives are playing an important part.

RESEARCH ON FORGE HEATING
(Continued from page 11)
are precisely right to make the steel hotter at cer-
tain points than the furnace atmosphere. This fact
and the fact that a steel burns at a lower tempera-
ture in an oxidizing than in a reducing atmosphere
give gas a decided advantage over oil at forging
temperatures. These findings have been published
with so much supporting data that they have been
generally accepted by the metallurgical profession.
They had, however, to be established by tests made
under very carefully controlled conditions and with
close attention to details of experimentation.
Several furnaces were used in these tests, an elec-
tric furnace, two open-fired gas furnaces, and a
muffl gas furnace. The muffle gas furnace, a pic-
ture of which is shown in Figure 1, was used for the
most exact tests. In this furnace it is possible to
control the temperature to within 5° F., which is
within the limit of accuracy of the platinum, plati-
num-rhodium thermo-couple used for measuring its
temperature. It is also possible to produce any
kind of atmosphere that is desirable. Furthermore,
in this furnace variations in pressure and rate of
flow of the gases can be produced and measured.
With such temperature and atmosphere control, it

was possible to know the actual conditions sur-
rounding the heating of each of the many test sam-
ples.
The forgemen who did the forging on the test
samples were quite often surprised at the ease with
which the steel forged when properly heated. The
practical forgeman knows that medium-carbon steel
is more difficult to forge that law-carbon because it
is harder, stiffer, and less ductile. However, when
properly heated in our special furnace, the medium-
carbon steel forged so easily that it was often mis-
taken by the forgemen for the low-carbon steel. It
is recognized that, of course, it may be some time
before a commercial gas-fired furnace can be built
which will give the accuracy of control attained in
this experimental furnace, but if furnaces can be
built to approach this accuracy of control, they are
bound to be popular with the forgemen, who are al-
ways most concerned with the ease of the forging
of their steel. It is the belief of the investigators
in this research that such a furnace is quite practi-
cal, and can be developed.
In studying burning of steel a great many tests
had to be made which are of primary importance
in the research but which are of only passive inter-
est to the gas engineer. The microscopic examina-
tions, the hardness and tensile tests, and the elec-
trical and magnetic tests are a recognized part of
the technique of the investigator. One of the
methods of test, however, the use of the X-ray, is
so new as to be of special interest. By means of
the X-ray it has been found to be possible to detect
steel burned entirely on the inside of the forging. It
was also found that, if such a steel forging is not cut
open but is further forged at a proper temperature,
the burned steel may then be rewelded so that no
vidence of burning is left. The X-ray equipment
which has been newly installed at the University is
shown in Figure 2. It is the most modern type of
equipment developed for this \vork. It is capable of
taking a radiograph of steel samples up to 4 inches
in thickness. The X-ray tube will stand 230,000
volts so that a steel sample four inches thick can
be photographed by about one hour's exposure. The
entire equipment shown in the picture is in a room
lined with sheet lead one-fourth inch thick. This
is necessary to protect the operator outside the
room during exposure since even short exposure of
the human body to the radiation given off by this
tube is dangerous.
As has been said, at the beginning of this re-
search the opinion of the average drop forgeman
had been that he needed heat in his metal but that
there was no need for pyrometric control of the
heat, much less control of the furnace atmosphere.
It is not to be expected that the forge industry in
general will at once change its views on the subject,
but a number of the more progressive shops have


Page Thirty-Seven
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
shown themselves receptive to ideas on improved
heating and have already changed to methods of
temperature control.
The studies of burning have been only one part
of the research. Other phases of the program which
have been and are being investigated are, the effect
of the rate of heating of the forging, the effect of
overheating, and the quantity of scaling and its
effect on the forging. Scaling has been found to be
especially important and to have a decided effect
on the quality and cost of the finished forging. The
technical articles on the results of the investigation
of these subjects have so far been published by the
Committee on Industrial Gas Research largely for
the consideration of highly technical metallurgists.
It is now planned to publish the facts for the bene-
fit of foremen and superintendents engaged in the
production of forgings. Articles on these subjects
will probably not appear in the gas journals since
they are of interest only to a comparatively small
group in the gas industry, namely, the specialized
industrial gas representatives. They will be pub-
lished in journals devoted to the fabrication of steel
since it is important that those in the forging in-
dustry be appraised of these facts. When the full
significance of these findings is appreciated, con-
trolled heating is bound to become one of the im-
portant developments in forging practice.

put his own region into literature in his own way.
He has done this in his stories, Main Travelled
Roads, Other Main Travelled Roads, Rose of
Butcher's Cooly, and others, but he has probably
done it most successfully in those remarkable
records of pioneer life, A Son of the Middle Border,
and A Daughter of the Middle Border. One should
read the entire series, including Trail Makers of the
Middle Border, and Back Trailers of the Middle
Border, for, while they are not all equally inspired,
they have no equal as narratives of pioneer life in
the Middle West. Those who follow the suggestion
of this column and prepare to read this latest of
Hamlin Garland's books, Roadside Meetings, should
read also at least the Son of the Middle Border.
The two books supplement each other very nicely.

Four Ingersoll-Rand vertical condensers, having a total condensing surface of 80,000
square feet, serve the 94,000-kw. generating Unit No. 10 in the Long Beach Steam Plant
of the Southern California Edison Company. These were the first large'capacity vertical
condensers to be arranged for single-pass water circulation.
They have demonstrated their ability to maintain the same efficient performance
and high rate of heat transfer that has characterized Ingersoll-Rand Condensers of the
more usual horizontal arrangement. This performance has been made possible through
the use of the characteristic I-R heart-shaped shell, external air coolers, and longitudinal
control of steam flow.
A second unit, duplicating No. 10 shown above, has recently been installed. This
unit is also served by four Ingersoll-Rand vertical condensers.
The Long Beach station was designed and built by Stone &amp; Webster
Engineering Corporation, under the supervision of the Department of

applicable to such laboratory uses as demand the most delicate
measurement of electric current.
So sensitive is this tube, that it can measure 0.000,000,000,000,000,01

ampere. This amount of current, compared with that of a 50-watt
incandescent lamp, is as two drops of water compared with the entire
volume of water spilled over Niagara Falls in a year.

The pinion bearings in the 6 Westinghouse-Nuttall gear reduction
units at the Washington Pulp and Paper Company have each rolled
up the enormous total of over 2,338,000,000 revolutions, and a recent
check-up shows that they are good for many millions more.
Loaded 100% of their Timken catalogue rating, they have averaged
6l/4 days per week, 24 hours a day since they were installed in
April, 1923.
The total distance traveled by each of these bearings is the equiva-

The Cathode Ray Oscillograph
By W. HERBERT BIXBY, Graduate Student
DURING recent years the study of certain
types of electrical engineering problems has
been becoming ever more important. These
problems have to do with transient electric phe-
nomena of extremely short duration. The fact that
more time had not been devoted to this study pre-
viously might
well be at-
t r i b u t e d to
two interrelated
causes, the lack
of necessity for
a solution, and
the lack of fa-
cilities for ob-
taining one. Re-
cently both bar-
riers have been
removed. The
increase in the
number of
power installa-
tions and trans-
mission lines
with the conse-
quent increase
i n importance
of surge volt-
age studies has
made research
relating to
these phenome-
na a practical
necessity, and new apparatus has been perfected
which opens the way for an engineering attack
heretofore impossible. It is essentially important
in the solution of problems of any type for one to
have a clear mental picture of that which is actually
happening before an explanation of the phenomena
THE GENERAL ELECTRIC CATHODE RAY
OSCILLOGRAPH
encountered is attempted. This can be afforded, in
this particular case, by the cathode ray oscillo-
graph which will give an actual photograph of the
variation of voltage with time for transient phe-
nomena lasting only a few tenths of a microsecond.
This article is concerned with the principles and
operation of
this very useful
a n d important
piece of ap-
paratus.
Every engi-
neer is familiar
with the D'Ar-
sonval type in-
strument used
for measuring
small direct
currents. This
instrument i s
the measuring
element of
nearly all di-
rect current
voltmeters and
ammeters. If a
constant valued
continuous cur-
rent is passed
through the
coil of one of
these instru-
ments it will
produce a constant deflection. If this current is
varied at a very slow rate the deflection of the
pointer will vary also and one can obtain a fairly
good idea of the manner in which the current is
fluctuating by observing this deflection at various
instants. This is actually done in practice with

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
recording direct current meters. Here a chart is
kept constantly moving under the inked pen of the
meter, and a curve, giving a relation of current to
time is traced out. If it is attempted to increase
the rate at which the current through the coil varies
a serious difficulty is at once encountered. The
mass of the moving elements of the meter prevent
it from giving a true reproduction of the current
fluctuation. The obvious solution of this difficulty
is to decrease the mass of the moving parts.
This has been done in the Duddell oscillograph
element. Instead of having a coil of many turns
of fine wire as in the D'Arsonval instrument, the
Duddell has merely a single loop of wire placed in
the magnetic ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^=
field. A sketch
of the essen-
tials of a Dud-
dell element is
shown in figure
1. The mirror
M is supported
by the con-
tinuous wire
stretched over
t h e ivory
bridges A and
B. N and S
are the north
and south poles
of an electro-
magnet supply-
ing the field.
When a cur-
rent is passed
through the
loop the mir-
ror is turned
through a small
angle by the
of following correspondingly greater rates of change
of current without difficulty. While the mass of
the moving parts is small it is by no means negligi-
ble. The effect of this mass is tending to produce
overswinging of the mirror is quite pronounced,
especially at the greater rates of change. In order
to reduce this effect as much as possible the mov-
ing parts are submerged in a thin damping oil. This
oil absorbs energy from the moving parts at a rate
dependent on their angular velocity and thus pro-
duces the desired result. By this means the rate
of change of current which can be successfully
studied has been greatly increased, but nevertheless,
the Duddell oscillograph is still limited by me-

which the mirror has been turned. If this reflected
beam is incident upon a moving photographic film
there will be a curve traced out on the film from
which the angular displacement of the mirror, and
consequently the current, could be calculated for
any relative instant. If the angular displacement
of the mirror is directly proportional to the current
through the element at each instant, and if the film
is moving at a constant rate this curve will be a
Cathode ray oscillograph.
Before specifically studying the Cathode ray
oscillograph it would be well to point out some of
the fundamental phenomena upon which its action
is based. Most everyone is more or less familiar
with the electron concept of electricity, but per-
haps it will not be digressing too much to point out
a few things to be kept in mind during the re-
mainder of this article. Electricity is apparently
graphical representation of the impressed current made up of identical discreet particles, called elec-
wave plotted to a linear scale providing the film is a
reasonable distance from the mirror, M. Since the
mass of the mirror and the two parallel wires be-
tween the bridges is extremely small compared with
the mass of the moving elements of a regular D'Ar-
sonval instrument, the Duddell element is capable
trons, which have extremely small mass and carrv
an extremely small negative electrical charge. An
electric current may be conceived as a net flow of
these particles in a direction opposite to that ordi-
narily accepted as positive for current flow. For
low velocities the particles obey all the laws of


Page Seven
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Newtonian mechanics and all electric forces can be
calculated assuming them to be charged particles
moving with the given velocity. An electron once
having acquired a definite velocity will continue to
travel in a straight line with the same velocity un-
til some forces are brought to bear upon it. These
forces may be of three distinct types. Those pro-
duced by the action of an electric field, those pro-
duced by motion of the electron in a magnetic field,
and those which in a broad sense might be at-
tributed to direct impact with an ion or molecule.
If a particle having a definite electrical charge is
placed in an electric field it will be acted upon by a
force directly proportional to the charge which it
carries and the field intensity at the point where
it is placed. If the charge is negative this force will
be in a direction opposite to the field intensity or,
in other words, in the direction of the potential
gradient. In connection with the second type of
force, a charged particle moving in a magnetic field
will be acted upon by a force proportional to the
quantity of charge it carries, its velocity, and the
magnetic field intensity. If the field were directed
vertically upward and the particle were charged
negatively this force would tend to swerve it hori-
zontally to the left as we look in the direction of the
motion. If the field were directed vertically down-
ward the force would end to swerve the particle
horizontally to the right. If the electron is mov-
ing in space, devoid of matter, the third force is re-
moved from consideration.
If a difference of potential of considerable magni-
tude is applied to two electrodes sealed in a well
FIGURE 2
evacuated tube, a small current will flow between
the electrodes. This can be roughly explained in
the following manner. The electric field intensity
has become so great that the electrons are acted
upon by forces of sufficient magnitude to cause
them to leave the negative electrode (or cathode)
and travel through the intervening space to the
positive electrode (or anode). If a small piece of
metal were inserted in the center of the cathode
which would permit electrons to flow from its sur-
face more easily than from the remainder of the
cathode, a more or less concentrated beam of these
electrons would be obtained. Such a beam is
known as a cathode ray. The tube mentioned above
is of the cold cathode type. In certain tubes a small
heated filament is placed in the center of the
cathode to emit the electrons. One of this type is
known as a hot cathode tube.
If one of these tubes is connected, as shown in
figure 2 to another tube containing two sets of
FIGURE i
parallel plates, one set being horizontal the other
vertical, this tube in turn being connected to a
vacuum bell we have one of the main essentials of
the cathode ray oscillograph. The anode of the
previous tube has been replaced by a fairly long
cylinder having a small pin hole bored along its
axis. The three chambers or tubes are thus con-
nected so that they can all be evacuated simultane-
ously.
By means of a vacuum pump the three cham-
bers are evacuated for operation. The anode is
kept at ground potential and a high negative volt-
age is applied to the cathode by applying a small
portion of the peak voltage of a sine wave voltage
(a-b, figure 2) to the primary of the high tension
transformer. This portion of the sine wave voltage
is obtained by proper setting of the two synchronous
switches Si and S..,. St is a high speed rotary switch
making 30 revolutions per second. So is a lower
speed switch making three revolutions per second.
Since contact can only be made when both switches
are closed, voltage is at most only applied to the
tube three times per second. During the applica-
tion of this voltage electrons leave the cathode and
are accelerated toward the anode. By the time
they reach the anode they have attained consider-
able velocity. The greater percentage of them will
hit the metal of the anode and there end their
journey through space. A very small percentage

What Shall I Read?
Mark Twain
By J. RALEIGH NELSON, Professor of English
THIRTY-FIVE years ago I would hardly
have ventured the confession I am about to
make. It would have been too damaging to
whatever reputation I may have had as a young
man of refined taste and decent morals. Yet to-
day I hereby publicly state that for the past twenty
years I have never failed to reread at least once a
year those two epics of American boyhood, Tom
Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. When, at twelve or
thirteen years, I surreptitiously brought these
books into the house, my mid-Victorian mother, ex-
amining Huckleberry Finn suspiciously, asked me
if I thought the language was altogether "choice".
I admitted it wasn't really, but tried to explain
wherein lay the charm and fascination of these
books. I never was able to make her understand.
In fact, I doubt if any woman has ever fully under-
stood. It seems strange now to recall that thirty
years ago many public libraries even in the larger
and more enlightened centers like Chicago and New
York did not allow Huckleberry Finn to circulate.
It was not thought fit for youthful consumption.
Strange, too, to reflect that the text books of that
period were utterly silent regarding Mark Twain
and the contribution he was making to the evolu-
tion of a really American literature. Yet today he
has come to be recognized both here and abroad as
one of the most original and genuinely native
geniuses America has produced. And Huckleberry
Finn is read in Russian,—though how they do it I
cannot imagine—in Persian, and in Chinese.
To me perhaps the most cheering aspect of this
change in attitude toward the work of Mark Twain
is that the literary passion which I so long cherished
in secret has become, at last, respectable and can be
spoken of in public. Perhaps I have been personal-
ly more susceptible to Tom Sawyer and Huckle-
berry Finn because of the fact that my own ro-
mantic boyhood was spent in a little river town
that looked out across the channels of the great
Mississippi. Our gang, like Tom Sawyer's, had its
secret cave high in the cliffs back of the town,
where for whole delectable Saturdays we sat about
our fire and looked out across the misty valley,
counting the endless procession of packets and
barges that threaded their tortuous way among the
wooded islands. Our world, too, had its romantic
figures,—Indians, half-breeds, shabby old soldiers,
French trappers, and rivermen. And always there
was the coming and going of the river traffic, a
pageant that is now all at an end. The picturesque
life of the great river which is so vividly recorded
in Tom Sawyer and especially in Huckleberry Finn
is the life I knew as a boy and I delight occasion-
ally through the magic of Mark Twain's two great
books to slip back into that life again.
I believe I am indulging in this rather intimate
comment on a rather personal reading habit, not be-
cause of two or three attractive new editions of
Tom Sawyer or Huckleberry Finn, nor because
Jackie Coogan is playing a film version of the im-
mortal Tom, but because I am convinced that many
men who read these books when they were boys
themselves do not realize how much pleasure they
could get from rereading them now with the per-
spective and viewpoint that comes with years.
They recapitulate for almost any man the experi-

for immediate use for all men who find themselves
losing that boyhood element in their consciousness
that keeps them from getting old.
Mark Twain's genius was so varied, he did things
so amazingly diverse, that I should like to recall to
the readers of these columns some of his other
books which it is interesting occasionally to re-
read, and which for me have a personal charm.
Puddin' Head Wilson puts me back again in the
little old river town, while Life on the Mississippi
recalls a trip I took as a boy on one of the floating
palaces that plied the upper river. They are two
books that supplement very satisfactorily a re-

Taken together these four books give the most au-

To one who has read Roughing It, with its vivid
pictures of the wild, rough life of the mining

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The Michigan Engineering Society
By FERDINAND &gt;. MENEFEE, Professor of Engineering Mechanics
THE Michigan Engineering Society traces its
history from the present uninterruptedly back
to February 28, 1880, when Professor R. C.
Carpenter of the Michigan Agricultural College,
now The Michigan State College, addressed letters
to thirteen engineers representing various locations
in the southern peninsula calling for a meeting at
which the Society was organized on March 25, 1880,
the first president being Professor Charles E.
Greene, of the University of Michigan. In one of
the first meetings of this Society mention was made
of the Surveyors and Civil Engineers Society organ-
ized at Lansing, August 20, 1869. The Transporta-
tion Library at the present time has some literature
which leads Professor John S. Worley to believe
that the Society is justified in claiming 1868 as the
year of the birth of the Society.
The Michigan Engineering Society is the only
state society embracing all classes of engineers. A
resume of the publications of the Society indicates
that the members very frequently discussed and
wrote about non-engineering matters, and that in-
dividually and as a group they have always been
interested in the engineer as a citizen as well as a
technical man.
For several years past the Society has had an
Advisory Council, composed of engineers and
THE CONSUMERS POWER BUILDING IN SAGINAW
formed into various committees and groups inter-
ested in some particular phase of activity bearing
on living conditions in the state at the present time.
The Advisory Council to the Society consists of the
following committees: education, engineering re-
search, drainage, legislative, metropolitan district,
publicity, public works, registration, state building
code, the status of the engineer, transportation,
water supply, and sewage disposal. It is through
the work of a society such as this that the young
professional man gets a great deal of advanced edu-
cation which is necessary for him in order that he

may most successfully apply the theories which he
obtained in college.
If one were to make a study of the organization
of a college or a university and compare the same
with a professional society, a striking similarity
would be found between their aims, objects, and
procedure; for instance, professional societies are
chartered and generally indicate in their constitu-
tion and by-laws that their purpose is the advance-
ment of the art or science which the particular so-
ciety represents, the professional improvement of
its members, the encouragement in the acquisition
of knowledge in the particular field represented by
the name of the society. Generally, there is also an
attempt to establish a central point for meeting,
reference, and for carrying on the business of the
society.
In addition to the foregoing, they have entrance
requirements, grades, entrance and matriculation
fees. They have conventions, committee meetings
in which the members may participate. Voluntary
studies are carried on by the members and reported
to the society to be entered on the professional
journals which later grow into a library. The so-

When Is Power Factor Correction
Worth While?
By L. II. BROWN, 31E
AT the present time there is in a large num-
ber of industrial plants and other users of
electric power a situation distinctly out of
harmony with our modern principles of economics,
—The condition of low power factor. Many manu-
facturing plants, eager to seize every opportunity to
increase plant efficiency, entirely overlook the pos-

sibilities of power factor correction. Likewise guilty
of costly neglect are the maintenance engineers of
large office buildings employing electrically driven
elevators. Further, the benefits which can be de-
rived from power factor correction are not limited
to the consumers of electricity but are available to
the producers of electricity as well.
Perhaps this inconsistancy of low power factor
existing in an otherwise efficient system can be at-
tributed to the highly technical nature of the prob-
lem involved. But when experience has shown that
the annual return on investment in corrective ap-
paratus through savings in power bills may be as
high as 100%, to say nothing of other benefits such
as reducing the electrical load on transformers and
wiring in the plant, it behooves every plant engi-
neer to investigate the possibilities of power factor
correction in his own plant. In proceeding now
with a technical discussion of power factor it is as-
sumed, of necessity, that the reader has a funda-
mental knowledge of alternating currents.
The power factor of any electrical system is the
ratio of the component of current in phase with the
voltage to the current. If the current is actually in
phase with the voltage the power factor is unity,
while for any condition in which the current is not
in phase with the voltage the power factor must be
some fraction less than unity. In nearly every
commercial alternating current system the current
lags the voltage so that the power factor of the sys-
tem is usually between 0.4 and 0.9.
The power output of any alternating current sys-
tem is the product of the voltage and in-phase cur-
rent. The component of current ninety degrees out
of phase with the voltage is of no value in produc-
ing power yet must be allowed for in determining
the size of conductors required throughout the sys-
tem. The reactive volt-amperes which increase as
the power factor is lowered, although in no way
useful, increase the size of wires needed in the trans-
mission lines and raise the ratings of all alternators,
transformers, and motors required in the system for
a given power output.
Because of the economic value of high power
factor many power companies have a clause in their
rate schedule which allows consumers to use power
at more favorable rates if their load power factor
is high. Very often the saving in power cost alone
due to the bonus for high power factor is sufficient
to justify the installation of corrective apparatus by
the consumer.
Individual conditions must be analyzed to deter-
mine the advisability of power factor correction.
An actual case is used for illustration in which cor-
rection was justified.

The Technique of High Vacuum
Practice
Ky KAMI EL G. COOPER, 32E
THE technique of high vacuum practice has
progressed rapidly during the last few years
due to the development of industries which
depend on this practice for their success. The suc-
cess of the incandescent bulb, the radio tube, the X-
ray tube and the neon or tube light sign has been
due primarily to the wonderful strides made by the
vacuum technician. Scientists in their researches
with rare or minute quantities of gases depend upon
the successful operation of the vacuum systems
which they use for the success and accuracy of their
experiments and tests.
Although much research work has been accom-
plished on vacuum pumps and gauges, improve-
ments are still being made on these invaluable
pieces of laboratory or shop equipment. A brief
description of some of these pumps and gauges
will serve to give the reader a better understanding
of the skill required to install and maintain a good
high vacuum system.
The simplest type of a vacuum pump is the jet
pump shown in Fig. 1. This pump is used success-
fully as an aspirator and as an aid in the filtration
of heavy liquids. It is also used as an injector and
as a combination injector and vacuum pump for
obtaining a vacuum in the condensers of steam en-
gines. Another simple type of vacuum pump is the
Toepler or Geisler pump as shown in Fig. 2. This
is one of the well known Armstrong pumps. The
mercury bottle A is raised very carefully forcing the
mercury into the chamber C pushing the gases
ahead of it through the check valve E. When the
-To Ifcfiwt/m

F:,5
mercury reaches the stop-cock nearly all of the gases
have been forced out of the pump. The remaining
gases are those which adhere to the walls of the
pump or condense under pressure. These gases
have to be removed by other pumps. After closing
the stop-cock the mercury column is lowered there-
by reducing the pressure in the pump chamber.
Opening the stop-cock F allows more gases to en-
ter the pump chamber. The bulb B is an air trap
which prevents air from entering the pump through
the mercury column.
These pumps are slow and very inefficient for
practical production methods. Several types of ro-
tary pumps have been designed which produce a

high vacuum in a relatively short time. One of the
most common types of rotary pumps is shown in
Fig. 3. This pump consists of a rotating cylinder
in a circular chamber. The rotating cylinder is ec-
centric and somewhat smaller than the chamber in
which it rotates, it is so constructed that it is al-
ways tangent to the casing at one point. As it ro-
tates it sweeps the gases ahead of it and operates
the slide valve A permitting the gases to enter or
leave the chamber. These pumps are oil-sealed to
lubricate and seal the working parts of the pump.
They are often connected in groups of chambers to
increase the capacity and reduce the amount of time
required to evacuate a system. The terms assigned
to them are "single stage," "two stage" or "three
stage" depending upon the number of groups.
Another extremely important group of pumps are
the molecular pumps. These pumps generally re-
quire a fore-vacuum and are used in series with a
rotary pump. Molecular pumps are built in many
types; rotary pumps, diffusion pumps, and vapor
pumps being, perhaps the most important types.
Fig. 4 illustrates one type of vapor pump. A is an
electric heater which vaporizes the mercury in the
bottom of chamber B. This vapor travels up
through cone C until it strikes deflector D, here the
vapors are deflected so that they strike the water
cooled walls E where they condense. The mole-
cules of the gases entering at F strike the walls E

Sketching Abroad
By FRANCIS KEALLY, A. I. A.
"S
RETCHING Abroad" is a subject which
seems to interest most of us in the archi-
tectural field who like to draw ; and Europe
is the place to sketch. Getting away from the place
where one lives or works, and landing in a country
which presents an entirely ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^=
new perspective and a
fresh flavor is an inspir-
ing nucleus for a sketch-
ing spree. Sketching out-
of-doors is the one way,
and as far as I know the
only way, for one to
achieve the feeling of real
form and solidity in draw-
ing. To copy another
man's technic is a dan-
gerous practice. Every
architect and artist of any
real ability always ex-
presses himself through
his own personality. One
should create a composi-
tion as one sees it: and not
through the eyes of a sec-
ond person. But I do not
wish to convey the thought
that we shouldn't study
the work of other men.
A CHURCH IX HF.LSINGFORS. FINLAND

That is both inspiring and educational. The art gal-
leries have a wealth of valuable material for the man
who is eager to learn. Etchings, Japanese and Chi-
nese prints, lithographs, water colors—all these
mediums are worthy of serious study.
In going abroad one must necessarily take a boat
(unless you are one of the chosen few to cross the
ocean by air). As long as one must spend a week
or more going and coming from Europe on a vessel,
which in reality is a small town in itself with its
several thousand inhabitants, why shouldn't one
take into consideration, in the selection of his ship,
its achitectural character? On the liner one has, day
after day, plenty of time to make sketches and to
study architectural detail and architectural compo-
sition. If the traveler has a limited amount of time
1 to spend abroad, then the
week or so on a boat each
way should be considered
as part of one's architec-
tural study. The time on
the boat really shouldn't
be lost architecturally.
Last summer, after I had
definitely decided to make
a trip to Europe, my next
thought was "What boat
shall we take?" A year
previously, the Swedish-
American line had invited
the members of the Archi-
tectural League of New
York to make an inspec-
tion of its new liner, the
"Kungsholm". I took ad-
vantage of this invitation
and spent an hour or so on
this beautiful ship. After
I had left the pier I reached
this conclusion. "Mv next
trip to Europe will be made on a boat which has
real architectural beauty." When we sailed last
August for Europe, we were on the "Kungsholm"
on our way to Stockholm. We liked the boat so
well that my wife and I decided to return on the
same ship.
The architecture of this modern vessel was de-
signed by Carl Bergsten, a distinguished architect
of Stockholm. His interiors on the "Kungsholm"
represent some of the most beautiful examples of

Brick
A Brief History of its Origin and Development
as an Industry and an Art
B.v CHARLES A. IIOWEN, Ceramist
THE story of clay working leads back into re-
mote antiquity and forward through the rise
and fall of many peoples and empires into the
myriad activities of the present, for which the al-
most innumerable classes of clay ware are manu-
factured.
In some archaeological borings in Egypt, debris
of burned brick were struck at a depth of 25 to 30
feet below the level of the valley of the Nile, and
this discovery, based upon the progressive eleva-
tion of the soil from the over flow, suggests that
these beds contain the
debris of brick deposited
there 10,000 years ago.
Recent excavations of
archaeologists, working at
Kish uncovered the Su-
merian Palace, greatest
and oldest residence of
ancient times, constructed
entirely of brick and in
quite good condition.
From this splendid brick
palace a mighty Empire
in the now barren sands
o f Mesopotamia w a s
ruled 5,000 years or more
ago.
In early dawn of re-
corded history, over 3,000 B.C., the Chaldeans had
already acquired and practiced the art of making
hard, durable, sun-baked adobe brick. The earliest
recorded date in history is found on a brick tablet
of the time of Sargon of Akkad, 3800 B.C. founder
of the Chaldean Empire. It was of course but
natural that the dwellers along the great Euphrates
and Tigris rivers should note how the sun baked
and irregularly cracked clay blocks, and to find
them, after crude shaping, very suitable for build-
ing the walls of a hut. When they learned to burn
the brick is not known, although they evidently
practiced this burning at the time the tower of
Babel was built. Before Nebuchadnezzar's reign
as king of Babylonia 604-562 B.C. men had learned
and practiced both the art of burning brick and of
enameling them. Tradition holds that the great
fish-god Cannes himself taught the Babylonians this
art; how highly they prized it is witnessed in the
patronage of the king who stamped each brick with
his name and this is probably the aristocratic and
venerable origin of placing a trade mark on a man-
ufactured product.
Herodotus, the Greek historian of the fifth cen-
tury B.C. described the wonders of Babylon which
included great walls, wonderful temples, and mar-
velous hanging gardens, all of which Nebuchad-
nezzar had built from
brick to please his Median
Queen.
The Assyrians, who de-
rived their civilization
from the Babylonians,
perpetuated the brick tra-
dition, and the remains
of their vast palaces of
brick, as well as of great
brick libraries — i.e.,
books made up of in-
scribed burned clay tab-
lets, form one of the most
interesting and valuable
links in recorded history.
It is likely that the

spread, in ancient times, eastward from the Meso-
potamian plains to Persia, India and China, and
westward to Egypt, Asia Minor, Greece and Rome.
In Egypt, which rivals Babylonia in the antiquity
of its civilization, the most ancient brick remains go
back to the fifteenth or sixteenth century B.C.
These are represented into pyramids made of sun-
dried brick found at Dashur, a few miles south of
Cario, said to have been the work of King Asychis.
It has been suggested that it may have been here
that Herodotus saw the singular inscription which
his Egyptian guide thus interpreted for him: "Dis-
parage me not by comparing me with pyramids
built of stone. I am as much superior to them as
Ammon is to the rest of the deities. I am con-

The Protective Value of Independent Inspection
Whenever an architect or engineer undertakes
supervision of construction and agrees to "endeavor
to guard the owner against defects and deficiencies
in the work of contractors," his responsibility ex-
tends far beyond matters of correct design and ade-
quate specifications.
To meet these responsibilities he will encounter
numerous difficulties which he must solve. The
material used in the construction of a building are
usually manufactured and fabricated, far from the
building site, thus the problem of testing and in-
spection become so complex that they require
special facilities, training and knowledge.
The specifications of most present clay structures
are based upon the detailed standards of recog-
nized engineering bodies such as the American So-
ciety for Testing Materials. Compliance with these
standards is expected of the contractor, but the
architect or engineer is rarely equipped to deter-
mine qualities or grades of material or workman-
ship with any degree of certainty.
In accepting or approving materials or workman-
ship on behalf of the owner, the architect or engi-
neer relieves the contractor's responsibility to the
owner. His approval is an acknowledgment that he
has inspected and accepts the work to comply with
specification and standard of practice.
How is the architect and engineer to protect him-
self against faulty material, design, or workman-
ship without involving the expenditure of a pro-
hibitive amount of money or unnecessary delays in
construction? The answer of this question is of
vital importance. As few engineers or architects
are equipped by training, experience, or can eco-
nomically command the necessary facilities it is ad-
visable to employ the competent and reliable serv-
ices of an independent testing laboratory. Such
services are strictly professional in character; they
cannot be bought, sold or bargained for as com-
modities. Their function is to protect the archi-
tect and the engineer in the fulfillment of his obli-
gations and responsibilities to his clients.
The economic value of such services is undis-
putable. They diminish the probability of struct-
ural failure, weakness or premature depreciation
through the acceptance of sub-standard materials
and workmanship. They also prevent serious eco-
nomic losses due to delays following the rejection
and replacement of material and workmanship not
in accordance with specification requirements. A
million dollar investment at six per cent costs ap-
proximately one hundred and sixty dollars a day.
Only a few days' delay by reason of faulty mate-
rial is necessary to convince the investor of the eco-
nomic value of independent inspection.
The following operations are necessary in the
inspection and acceptance of fabricated structural
steel. As the steel must be of the correct metal-
lurgical composition, it must be examined in the
mill laboratory by a man with a thorough knowl-
edge of steel specifications. The plates after roll-
ing must examined, checked for defects, and shaped.
Each section must be checked against drawings for
section, dimensions and accuracy of field connec-
tions. Column ends must be accurately milled
reaming done where specified and rivets inspected.
The finished section must be protected against
oxidation by painting or by some other approved
method.
The approved section is sent to the building site
and again the architect and engineer face problems
of supervision. The columns must be plumb with-
in the required tolerances, especially in the case of
elevator shaft columns. There must be no inter-
changing of part or forced fits by excessive use of


Page Fifteen
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
drift pins, instead of reaming. All riveted joints
must be inspected for tightness and proper forma-
tion and faulty rivets removed and replaced. If
welding is used, proper inspection is absolutely
vital to its success. Painting must be inspected
during the construction process and a close check
made to insure proper protection structural steel.
All cement used in structural work must be care-
fully inspected. It is customary for engineers and
architects to specify cement complying with the A.
S. T. M. Physical Standards. To definite ascer-
tain a complete knowledge of the characteristics of
the cement used in a building using 10,000 barrels
of cement it would necessitate the taking of one
complete set of tests for each 200 barrels in a
storage bin. The first operation would involve
making 50 sampling operations, including sacking,
marking, and transporting to the laboratory office
50 complete test samples. These must be made into
300 tensile briquettes, stored and broke at their
proper ages. In addition, 50 complete sets of test
for fineness must be made, 50 tests for normal con-
sistency, 50 tests for soundness, and 50 tests for
time of setting.
The cement itself is but one component of the
reinforced concrete used in the structure. The ag-
gregate must be tested for organic material, sound-
ness, grading, and moisture content. The steel used
in reinforcing must be tested and inspected for size,
disposition, bends, and to determine that it is firmly
supported during pouring operations.
Similar tests must be made for timber to de-
term defects, and proper protective coatings. These
and numerous other inspections must be made, both
efficiently and economically. This very necessary
and vital part of modern construction is rapidly be-
coming recognized and it is not unusual to see the
following specification clause in the contracts of
large structural undertakings: "All laboratory, mill,
shop and field inspections called for in other divi-
sions of these specifications shall be made by (name
of selected testing laboratory )and all reports there-
of shall be delivered to the (architect or engineer).
The contractor shall incorporate in his proposal an
allowance of (state amount) to cover the cost of
these independent inspections and tests. These
sums shall be expended at the architect's (or engi-
neer's) discretion and any unexpended balance shall
revert to the owner, and any additional costs in-
curred at the architect's (or engineer's) order shall
be paid by the owner."
Debating Society
The several fellows in the picture are the story
tellers, wranglers and debaters of Sigma Rho Tau,
engineering declamatory group. Several debating
teams will soon be chosen from among these men to
contest with Adelphi, Ypsilanti, and the Detroit In-
stitute of Technology on subjects of economic and
engineering interest.
Dean Sadler has especially exerted himself to ob-
tain the use of the room across from the library for
the debating society and it is hoped that the mem-
bers will avail themselves of the material that is
being collected there. Miss Thomas, of the Library
Extension Division, is working on the project; she
has spent considerable of her time and has given
much valuable material to the collection. Miss Rat-
liff, the librarian of the West Engine Library, is
also assisting with this important work. The refer-
ence material is growing every day and there is a
great amount of material available on such sub-
jects as: The Export of Helium, Windowless Build-
ings, Diesel Engines, Welding, Rivetting, Co-opera-
tive Engineering Courses, and the Muscle Shoals

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
COLLEGE NOTES
Professor Stephen Timosheiiko
Professor Timoshenko, of the department of ad-
vanced mechanics of the University of Michigan is
known not only at the university, but throughout
this country and abroad as one of the world's out-
standing authorities on higher mechanics, particu-
larly in the theory of elasticity.
He was born in Russia in 1878, then, after a thor-
ough preliminary training, he entered the Institute
of Ways of Communication, St. Petersburg, where
he received his degree as a Civil Engineer in 1901.
He was retained for some time at this institution
as instructor in mechanics.
Shortly after he accepted a
similar position with the Poly-
technical Institute of St. Pet-
ersburg. There he became an
assistant professor and in 1906
was given the chair of Ap-
plied Mathematics at the Poly-
technical Institute of Kiev.
In 1913 he returned to his
alma mater to occupy the new-
ly created chair of Theory of
Elasticity as applied to ships,
having in the meantime ac-
quired the degree of adjunct of
Applied Mechanics. The last
position was a result of his
work as Consulting Engineer
for the engineering depart-
ments of the St. Petersburg

member of various important
government committees during
the war, among them the
Technical Council of the Air-
PROF. TIMOSHENKO
was employed by the Vibration Specialty Company
of Philadelphia as Consulting Engineer.
In 1923 he went over to Westinghouse where he
worked on the research staff. The University of
Michigan discovered him at Westinghouse and in-
vited him to come here and found a school of Ad-
vanced Mechanics, the only one of its kind in the
country; he is also developing a research labora-
tory at the university. Recently he accepted an
offer to become a member of the Advisory Board of
the Westinghouse Laboratories, a board made up of
five consulting members from
the leading universities to
stimulate and guide Westing-
house research.
The interview with Dr.
Timoshenko revealed a man of
calm dignity, congenial nature
and a sophisticated sense of
humor. He chided the Technic
gently for not running more
technical articles and re-
counted some of his student
days in the fatherland.
Dr. Timoshenko has been a
most prolific contribution to
technical magazines on every
phase of strength of mate-
rials. He has published a
number of books and has re-
cently completed two volumes
on the strength of materials.
These volumes are being used
by his students at the present
time. A third book on more
advanced work is in prepara-
craft Division of the Russian WTar Department.
The revolution then came on, and, like many of
his countrymen, Dr. Timoshenko left his homeland
for more favorable climes. He then spent a few
years at the University of Zagreb, Jugoslavia, teach-
ing mechanics and testing materials. He came to
the United States in 1922, from this position, and
tion. The Societies to which he belongs are legion;
he is a member of the Ukranian Academy of Sci-
ence, the Russian Academy of Science, the Mathe-
matical Society and a host of others. He is also
a member of the Executive Committee of the Ap-
plied Mechanics Division of the American Society
of Mechanical Engineers. The Research Club and

Sigma Xi also claim him as a member. Phi Kappa
Phi, national honor society recently elected him to
their group.
Outside of his particular field Dr. Timoshenko is
quite interested in economics but he smilingly con-
fided that his brother, Vladimir, of the Business
Administration school probably knows more about
the subject. The concerts at Hill Auditorium also
have an attraction for the doctor and we're certain
that he has a poignant
interest in literature.
New Language
Requirements
Modern language, as
a compulsory increment
of the engineering cur-
riculum has retired to a
back seat.
The question of re-
quiring the modern lan-
guage for our engineer-
ing degree has been un-
der active discussion for
some time and, on De-
cember 5th, at a Fac-
ulty Meeting, it was de-
cided to dispense with
the much disputed
requisite. Henceforth
modern languages shall
be optional to the engi-
neering student. In the
particular case of chem-
ical engineering a read-
ing knowledge of Ger-
man will usually be
necessary as a part of
the equipment in this
branch of study.
The underlying rea-
son for the change has
been to give the stu-
dents an opportunity to
broaden themselves in _
subjects of a more gen-
eral, sometimes called cultural, type instead of being
unwillingly restricted to the narrower confines of
modern languages. It should be understood that
this action does not mean dropping languages en-
tirely; in fact, where it is possible, students are en-
couraged to carry a language to the point where a
reading knowledge of the subject will be obtained.
This will tend to eliminate the type of student who
considers the work decidedly tedious and will stim-
ulate the student who is really interested in the lan-
guage.
The various departments of the college, and the
Standing Committee, have been making a rather

FRAN BEBEE
New York state has
duced many and divers types
of individuals and now we find
one of its products in the en-
lightening rays of our spot-
light. His name is Francis H.
Bebee and his home town is
Buffalo.
The University, having a
very favorable recommenda-
tion of a preparatory career,
opened its doors to Freshman Bebee in the fall of 1927.
Fran soon manifested some promising natatorial skill
so he swam with the Frosh tankmen during his first year.
He also studied a bit—as evidenced by his admission to
Phi Eta Sigma at the close of the academic term. Sig-
ma Phi, social fraternity, classes him as an enhancing
member in good standing. Sophomore years are usually
rather lean affairs but our friend made the best of it;
pursuing knowledge, making a few social skirmishes, and
serving on the Engineering Council.
The grand march of the 1930 Junior Prom was led
by none other than Mr. Bebee and, of course, his charm-
ing companion. Miss McLean. During the junior term
he was elected to Tati Beta Pi. This year he serves as
president of the scholastic group. A.S.C.E. recognized
the potential civil engineer and they also elected him to
their ranks. Triangles, who had been pacing nervous-
ly about in the offing, now stepped in and placed their
ensignia on his modest vest.
The Engineering Council is, at present, having a jolly
time with the smoking rooms and we find our demo-
cratic friend voicing his opinions for the rest of the
common people. This has been Fran's third year with
the council. Last spring, Yulcans, senior honorary and
activities fraternity asked him to join the brotherhood.
The familiar gold anvil is now one of his proud pos-
sessions.
Bebee is very well known about the engineering school,
also the rest of the campus, and many of those who use
surveying instruments have met him as an assistant in the
instrument room. His college career has been both pro-
ductive and eventful and his achievements have come
through an industrious application of intelligence coupled
with a generous bit of pleasing personality.
exhaustive study of the courses in the different cur-
ricula with a view toward possible changes and im-
provements. The sixteen hours, which had former-
ly been set aside for modern languages, will be re-
stricted to non-engineering subjects which must be
chosen from the language and literature group, the
social sciences, such as history, economics, politi-
cal science, philosophy, etc., and the physical sci-
ences, such as physics, astronomy, etc. The funda-
mental ideal is to elimi-
nate a dillitantish dab-
bling in subjects which
require more than one
semester to merely in-
troduce, so the selection
in the various subjects
will, in most cases, re-
quire at least two se-
mesters work. There
are a few courses, for
instance, general as-
tronomy, which can be
satisfactorily taught in
one semester and this
type will be the ex-
ception to the general
rule. There are also
some courses which will
not be open to fresh-
men because of the
necessary prerequisites.
Men who, at the present
time, have completed
only one semester's work
in a language will be re-
quired to finish out the
second semester, as a
normal language course
necessitates two semes-
ters of study before it
becomes comprehensive.
Men who have started
and completed two se-
mesters of work in in-
troductory language
~ courses may drop these
courses and enter the wider field provided by the
elective substitutes.
Similar programs have existed for some time in a
great many of the engineering schools in the United
States and they have been quite successful. The
new ruling will be effective beginning with the sec-
ond semester in February, 1931.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
ALUMNI NEWS
John M. Watson
Fate has decreed that three prominent Michigan
graduates should join efforts in controlling the des-
tinies of a great technical society. The interest of
these three men is centered in the science of metal-
lurgy, and it is fitting that they should become offi-
cers of an internationally known organization such
as the American Society for Steel Treating.
Ray T. Bayless, '14E, became assistant secretary
in charge of technical activities, and A. H. d'Arcam-
bal, '12E, became Vice-President at the last elec-
tions. The crowning honor, how-
ever, fell to John M. Watson,
'09E, who takes office the first of
the year, as the President of the
American Society for Steel Test-
ing.
Mr. Watson was born at Prov-
idence, Rhode Island, late in No-
vember of 1883; the son of Wal-
ter D. and Bella (Carr) Watson.
After completing his primary
schooling, he realized the ad-
vantages and possibilities of a
University such as Michigan, and
foreswore the offerings of the
many good technical schools in
the East, for the undoubted vir-
tues of Ann Arbor, there to en-
ter the College of Engineering
JOHN M. WATSON
to become the Engineer of Tests, for the Sheldon
Axle Company.
Just five years after graduation , Mr. Watson
found himself again in Michigan, this time in a po-
sition with the Hupp Motor Car Company, with
whom he has remained to the present time. His
rise with the Hupp people was rapid, and today,
with the bestowing of the honor of the Society Pres-
idency, we find him Chief Metallurgist of that com-
pany. Mr. Watson is well known, not only as a
metallurgist, and an engineer, but
for his papers upon preparation
and heat treating of steel. He is
the author of the "Heat Treat-
ment of Automotive Parts," and
of numerous papers delivered in
the Symposium of the American
Society for Steel Treating.
Besides his administrative in-
terest in the A.S.S.T., he is a
member of the Society of Auto-
motive Engineers, the American
Society for Treating Materials,
The British Iron and Steel Insti-
tute, and others.
Mr. Watson was married to
Miss Helen L. Hastings, in May,
1914, and the union has been
blessed with the advent of daugh-
and Architecture, in the year of 1906.
Mr. Wratson gained his diploma in 1909, bear-
ing the degree of B.S. in Chemical Engineering.
Directly after the festivities of graduation, he made
a long trip to Dallas. Texas, to assume the duties
of chemist for the Texas Portland Cement Com-
pany. Leaving this company in March of the fol-
lowing year, he continued his work in the labora-
tories of the Packard Motor Car Corporation, De-
troit, Michigan, where he specialized in metallurgy.
His work here gave him prominence, and less than
two years later we find him in new surroundings,
having transferred to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania,
ters, Gretchen Priscilla, and Mary. The Watsons
live on Eason Avenue, in Detroit, Michigan.
Mr. Watson takes time from his work to chase a
golf ball around the grounds of the Grosse He Golf
and Country Club, and to bowl, when ever he can,
and it is rumored that he is a member of the De-
troit Athletic Club. We know definitely that he
voted for Hoover in the last election.
Mr. Watson's brother officer, Mr. d'Arcambal,
also holds the degree of B.E. in Chemical Engineer-
ing, and is at present employed as Consulting
Metallurgist with the Pratt and Whitney Com-
pany, in Hartford, Connecticut. Mr. Bayless, after


Page Nineteen
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
working with a number of companies as metal-
lurgist, joined the A.S.S.T. in 1922, as editor of the
official publication, a position which he held until
just recently.
It is simultaneously an honor and a pleasant co-
incident that three of our alumni body should be
chosen to fill influential places in directing the af-
fairs of the American Society of Steel Treating. It
is significant that the experience and training of-
fered by the University of Michigan, is such that
our graduates can hold their heads high among the
graduates of other technical schools, and more than
share the honors that are awarded to the successful
engineer. Michigan is proud of them, and is happy
to congratulate these three alumni upon their signal
honor, and success.
To Our Alumni Readers
Without your co-operation and support, your-
selves, and your affairs, this section would cease
to hold its place in the Michigan Technic. The
Editor of the section seldom hears directly from
"old grads," notable exceptions being in the case of
the little edition of the '98 Engineer's News-Letter,
which comes in regularly, and furnishes us with
real, up to date, and interesting information con-
cerning this class.
Do you realize that a goodly percentage of your
old classmates read The Technic, and that each un-
doubtedly goes through this section just as you
started to, looking for a familiar name. Why not
help us, and that old classmate who might like to
know what has become of you, by dropping a post
card to the Alumni News Editor, care of the Mich-
igan Technic, with your name, class, and any news
items concerning yourself, or a graduate friend, that
you may have? The Section has been noticeably
bare for want of snapshots, and photographs to ac-
company the news item. We are always glad and
willing to receive these, along with the bits of news
that you may have, and you may be sure that each
will be published. How about it, Mr. Grad?

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Michigan Scientist Denies Advocating
Windowless Buildings
Windows are a perfectly satisfactory method .of
lighting under normal conditions, and have the
added benefits of providing the light which is the
cheapest and best suited to the human eye when
they are properly designed and cared for, stated
Professor H. H. Higbie of the University of Michi-
gan College of Engineering and Architecture in is-
suing a pointed denial that he had ever recom-
mended artificial rather than natural light, or the
construction of windowless buildings. Professor
Higbie is an Electrical Engineer and nationally
known authority in the fields of both artificial and
natural lighting.
"The stories which imply that I recommend or
predict windowless building are evidently based up-
on a misinterpretation of a paper I presented at the
annual meeting of the Illuminating Engineering So-
ciety, October 9, 1930. This paper was a report of
work I have been doing on the effect of various
sorts of glass on the amount and distribution of
daylighting in rooms containing windows.
"We found that one of the greatest hindrances to
lighting was dirt on the glass, and I stated that the
public ought to be taught to clean their windows
oftener and better than is usually thought neces-
sary if the best results of natural light were to be
secured, and stated that unless people were brought
to realize that daylight is efficient and desirable,
and may be easily had by choice and care of window
glass, shades, blinds and other window equipment,
some other group of people who have commercial
reasons to see windowless buildings come in will
start a campaign of publicity to convince the public
that it is useless and unwise to install glass. My
statements, however, have been so twisted as to
make it appear that I had predicted the likelihood
or desirability of windowless structures."
Windows are a perfectly satisfactory way of light-
ing under normal conditions according to Professor
Higbie's experiments which have extended over a
period of seven years. Windows containing glass
are more efficient than those without, he found, be-
cause though some light fails to penetrate the glass,
that which does may be better distributed about the
room.
"The best practicable artificial lighting should
always be installed in a building," states Professor
Higbie, "but it is well to remember that daylight
is about 15 times as efficient as artificial light of
the same quality. Furthermore, if daylight is elim-
inated as in a windowless building the owner should
remember that this will involve spending three to
five times as much for lamp renewals and current
than usual. Generally those who advocate window-
less buildings for others select for themselves a nice
corner room with plenty of windows and natural
light, and high up so as to give the best view pos-
sible."
What Price Emptiness?
I've never heard of anyone going to the store and
asking the merchant for " a dollar's worth of empty
space", and yet a great many people spend a great
many dollars each year buying empty space.
Whenever you buy certain kinds of incandescent
lamps, you are purchasing a little bit of emptiness
wrapped up in a glass container. X-rays enable
medical doctors to study and repair human anat-
omy, and X-rays are helping other kinds of doctors
to study the anatomy of the atom—and, described in
its simplest terms, an X-ray tube is simply two
pieces of metal placed inside a glass bottle full of
emptiness. Vacuum bottles, on picnics, keep your
coffee hot and your orange juice cold; and vacuum
tubes make it possible to send voices and music for
thousands of miles through empty space. Other
vacuum tubes provide us with electric eyes, better
in some respects than human eyes. All in all, you
buy millions of dollars' worth of vacuum devices
each year—and yet the price paid for such useful
kinds of emptiness is surprisingly low when you
think of the cost of learning how to make the kind
of emptiness required—and then, how to make con-
tainers full of nothing to do the jobs they do.
Radio—either the sending of programs or the re-
ception of music and speech, is not at all the pro-
found mystery it used to be. Certainly, radio is in-
timately connected with these containers of empty
space called vacuum tubes. Without them, radio
as we know it today would be impossible.
Most people have felt the wonder, the awe-in-
spiring mystery of the devices that permit ready
and instant communication over the entire surface
of the world. Many people, at some time or other,
are curious about the "how" and "why" of radio.
But usually our daily work claims so much of our
attention that this business of radio is accepted, like
a lot of other puzzling things, as a matter of course.
Another reason for the general lack of under-
standing of radio—for real misunderstanding some-
times—lies in the unfamiliar names so constantly
used by those who talk or write about the sending
or receiving of programs. Who would know that
a "grid" is simply an abbreviation for a well-known
and familiar word gridiron, and that it means a
small piece of metal, placed inside an exhausted
bulb to do the same sort of job for electric, or elec-
tron, currents, that the faucet in the kitchen sink

"superheterodyne", "radio frequency", and "screen
grid" mean anything definite to the great majority
of people?
Actually, all these things do mean something, and
in reality the meaning isn't nearly so difficult or
puzzling as the names seem to indicate. The job
I've set out to do is simply that of taking apart
some of these mysterious words to see what they're
made of and then putting them back together again
in such a way that they do make sense. Naturally,
such a job can't be done in a few minutes—but per-
haps we can make a start tonight.
Everyone knows that broadcast programs are not
sent out from the station as sound. Just step out on
the back porch and try talking, or even yelling—
sending sound—over to Australia or down to the
Antarctic! So what the station sends isn't sound.
You wouldn't really expect it to be, anymore than
you'd expect the telegraph company to send a slip
of yellow paper from place to place along some
wires. All the radio broadcast station does is to
change the original sound—the music or the voice
—into electric currents and then somehow use these
electric currents to bump, jar, make splashes in the
space around the station. The air hasn't a thing
to do with it—broadcasting would go along just
the same if all the air were removed from our Earth
—although the people who listen to the programs
might feel the loss of the atmosphere rather keenly.
So, all a transmitting station does is make a lot
of "bumps" in space. Now the "space" behaves
very much like jelly—if you bump or jar it in one
spot, the disturbance travels—spreads out—and in
less than a twinkling of an eye—that jar has trav-
eled all around the world. Vacuum tubes of course,
make it possible for broadcasting stations to pro-
duce the right kind of bumps in space—and some-
time later perhaps we'll see just how that's done.
Incidentally, sending stations are not the only
things that make bumps in space—when a spark like
lightning jumps from cloud to earth or back again,
the bumps produced in space are apt to reach your
radio set and cause you to say unkind things about
"static", whatever that is.
Now let's look at the other side of the picture for
just a moment. These splashes in space—these so-
called ether waves—reach your home possessing
very little energy. So a receiving set, essentially, is
just a gadget that will pick up these minute space
disturbances and in some way make the tiny energy
coming to the set from far away places control
other energy, supplied by batteries or by the house
current in your home. You see, the energy re-
ceived from any broadcasting station is much too
small to make a loudspeaker operate—you, your-
self, must supply that energy but the incoming
radio waves must be made to control your local sup-
ply. Again vacuum tubes are essential for this.
Let's try to paint this picture over again.
Imagine a nice expensive vase resting peacefully
on the piano. Along the street comes a truck, or
on the nearby track a train or trolley rushes by. All
at once the vase begins to "sing", that is it vibrates.
Not all trains or all trucks make it vibrate — just
certain ones. Whenever the bumps — vibrations —
caused by the train or truck exactly suit the tem-
perament of that piece of china, off it goes on a
"song and dance". Now the business of building
a receiving set, boiled down, consists in providing a
series of vases — or one vase with a lot of artistic
temperament — that will "sing" or vibrate whenever
the bumps or waves in space reach it. Really, that's
pretty simple, isn't it — but it's taken years of ad-
venturing, the time and best efforts of many skill-
ful men to make "vases" like that.
Without vacuum tubes, radio would still be in
the "sparking" stage. But even with the best of
vacuum tubes, ready to use, there were hosts of
other problems that needed solving before it was
possible to build a receiving set that would do a
steady, dependable job of turning space bumps into
well-sounding programs. Perhaps we can tackle
some of these problems some other Wednesday
night. — E. L. Manning, Research Laboratory, Gen-

took part in the lectures and discussions. Professor
Ehrenfest lectured on the development of the funda-
mental laws of physics and conducted discussions
on advanced theories. Late theories of radiation
were dealt with by Professor Fermi and Dr. Morse
lectured on the quantum theory.

THE CATHODE-RAY OSCILLOGRAPH
(Continued from page 7)
will hit the small pin hole and pass through the
anode into the next tube, it is in there that we are
particularly interested. Having once passed through
the anode the electrons would, if not affected by any
outside forces, travel along a straight path with un-
diminished velocity and hit approximately in the
center of the fluorescent screen at the far end of
the vacuum bell. The screen would then fluoresce
and a bright shot would appear at its center. If a
single electron is studied as it travels through the
tube it is quite obvious that it will be between the
deflecting plates for a short interval of time, the
duration of which will depend upon the velocity of
the electron and the longitudinal dimension of the
plates. If a potential difference were applied to
the vertical plates the electron would be accelerated
in a vertical direction during this interval that it is
between them. Since every electron would be af-
fected likewise the spot produced on the screen
would be shifted either upward or downward de-
pending upon the direction of the applied difference
of potential. Passing a vertical magnetic field
through the tube by means of the sweep coil shown
will cause the electron beam to be bent horizontally
with the result that the shot will be shifted horizont-
ally. If this field is made to vary uniformly, first
being directed upwards then passing through zero
value to become directed downward, the beam will
be bent first to the left and then to the right. The
fluorescent spot will be swept across the screen
from left to right in a horizontal straight line. The
rate at which this sweeping will take place will de-
pend upon the rate of change of flux density in the
magnetic field. For ordinary operation the time
required for the shot to travel completely across the
screen will be less than 1000 microseconds or one-
thousandth of a second. Visual observation will
then show a luminous horizontal trace across the
screen.
If a constant difference of potential is now applied
the vertical deflecting plates, this whole trace will
be merely raised or lowered, still remaining hori-
zontal. However, if a varying potential difference
is applied, the trace will no longer be a straight line
but will be a curve whose ordinates are propor-
tional to the applied voltage and whose abscissae are
proportional to time. This, briefly, is the action of
the cathode ray oscillograph. It will be noted that
the only moving element involved is a beam of
electrons. Since an electron has. from a mechani-
cal standpoint, negligible mass and since there are
no forces tending to return an electron to its orig-
inal path after it has once been deflected there will
be practically no upper limit to the rates of change
which can be successfully studied on this oscillo-
graph.
There are several principles to be kept in mind
during the operation of the oscillograph. If the
voltage applied to the cathode ray tube is varied the
terminal speed of the electrons will also vary. In-
creased voltage will result in increased velocity, the
velocity being approximately proportional to the
square root of the applied voltage. An increased
velocity means that each electron will be under the
deflecting plates for a shorter period of time with a
consequence that it will not be deflected as much
laterally. Briefly, increasing the voltage applied to
the tube decreases the magnitude of the picture
viewed on the screen. The vertical dimension will
be approximately inversely proportional to the volt-
age applied to the cathode ray tube. The horizontal
dimension will be approximately inversely propor-
tional to the square root of the voltage. However,
for a constant applied voltage the scales will be very
nearly linear. The voltage applied to the cathode
is obtained by applying a portion of the peak volt-
age of a sine wave to the primary of the high ten-
sion transformed as mentioned above. For fast
sweeps this portion will give a nearly constant
voltage but for slow sweeps there may be some
slight distortion of the trace near the edges of the
screen. The sweep coil itself may distort the time
scale slightly since the rate of change of flux will
not be exactly uniform for slow sweeps. The rate
of sweep depends greatly on the sweep coil current
and since this will vary with any variance in the
supply voltage it is necessary to have some wave of
known frequency to apply to the oscillograph in or-
der to calibate the time axis. This wave is known
as a timing wave and can be supplied easily by a
fifty watt oscillator.
When observing phenomena it is highly desirable
to obtain some permanent record of the thing en-
countered. Since a cathode ray will leave a trace
on a photographic film similar to the trace left by a
strong beam of light, this method can be used to
obtain this record. It becomes necessary, though,
to place the film in the vacuum bell. The machine
shown in the accompanying photographs uses a
standard roll film placed in a film holder in back of
the fluorescent screen in the vacuum bell. The
screen is thrown forward exposing the film to the
direct action of one cathode ray when pictures are
taken. Both the screen and the film are operated
by external levers working through vacuum tight
joints.
One other problem is of prime importance in all
surge studies. This is the problem of synchroniza-
tion, that is, coordination of time of the surge and
the time at which the oscillograph is in operation so
that the desired phenomena can be seen or photo-
graphed. If the surge is artificially produced such
as artificial lightning surges, arc discharges, etc., the

TWENTY-EIGHT miles upstream from New
Orleans a great flood gate known as the
Bonnet Carre spillway is being completed. In
times of high water this concrete dam on the
east bank of the Mississippi will tap the flood
before it reaches the city, diverting the danger-
ous excess into Lake Pontch art rain.
The Bonnet Carre spillway consists of a con-
crete dam and a pier-and-weir section about 7700
feet long. The weir sections, which are twenty
feet wide between the piers, have timber needles
on the crests at two levels — elevations 16 and 18
A traveling crane, on a bridge spanning the
piers, removes the timber needles for discharge.
N. E. C. equipment played an important part in
the construction set-up. Two Koehring Cranes
handled aggregate at the material bins and a
third Koehring placed the concrete with an
Insley bucket. Two large Smith mixers mixed the
127,000 cu. yds. of concrete used on the project.

Love Life of an Engineering Student.
Fools may sing of hearts and love
And eyes and cheeks and hair,
Write sonnets to a woman's glove,
And swears her wondrous fair.
Bah! She's an artificial thing,
All powder paint and lipstick.
But harken to the song I sing—
All hail my love, the slipstick.
Women are babbling all the time
Of dates and drinks and dresses,
Which wouldn't help at all when I'm
Computing torques and stresses.
It conquers without fear or doubt
Whole hosts of sines and sturds,
And helps me work in peace without
An avalanche of words.
Slide rules are always accurate
And women never so;
And while they're not affectionate,
They never answer "No!"
So, hence, with women's wanton ways,
With eyebrows, lips, and curls.

I awoke to look upon a face
Silent, white and cold;
Oh, friend, the agony I felt
Can never half be told.
We lived together, but a year;
Too soon, it seemed, to me
Those gentle hands outstretched and still
That toiled so hard for me.
My waking thoughts had been of one
Who now to sleep has dropped;

Tom Squift and His Flying Typewriter.
One bright, spring, morning a stalwart youth
drove up in front of the East Engineering portal and
proceeded to alight from his sleek gray Rolls. At this
astounding and unexpected turn of events, several
students quickly threw away their cigarettes and
clattered down the stairs to greet the newcomer.
"I," quoth this curly eyed, blue haired lad," "am
Tom Squift, the boy inventor, and I should like to
interview a few of the profs on the practicability of
feeding race horses and football players on green
peas so that they can run on ball bearings."
At this quip, the crowd, which by this time had
reached very generous proportions, set up such an
infernal din that our hero was forced to scurry into
the bushes and bay like an infuriated bloodhound in
order to disperse the enthusiastic demonstrators.
When quiet had been restored, Tom crept forth
and came face to face with Sid Cocaine and his
toady, Fifthy K. McNasty. These gentlemen ap-
peared to resent the presence of Tom and began to
weave back and forth in a manner suggesting a
long, black, sinuous reptile. The villains advanced
slowly drawing knives and other pointed instru-
ments as they came. Sid and Filthy clearly had
mayhem in their souls.
"Here," said Thomas crisply, "what are you ras-
cals up to now"?
"Heh, heh," smiled the desperados, twirling their
black, greasy mustachios and rolling their glitter-
ing eyes, "in our poweh at last, eh? Now then, may
be you'll tell us the secret of the Squift Sea Going
Box Car."
But happily our hero remembered his wonderful
flying typewriter and whipping it out of his pack-
sack he clambered aboard and roared aloft.
Sailing serenely overhead he hurled imprecations
at the impostors until they had slunk away toward
State Street, vowing to get even.
Whether the bad chaps did so, and what hap-
pened to our friend Tom will be found in the next
book of this series entitled, "Tom Squift and His
Electric Artichoke."

keep right on smoking if she transfixes you with one
of those looks and says in frigid tones, "Sir, the
fumigations arising from your tobacconistic reser-
voir are such that my apparel will shortly become
saturated, unless by the abundant suavity of your

problem is greatly simplified. The coordination may
lie affected by means of synchronous switches.
However, if the phenomena is natural or uncon-
trollable, such as encountered in lightning stroke
studies, switching operations, etc., the problem is
much more complex. Some method has to be de-
vised to make the surge start the cathode ray which
is to photograph it. This can be done by a proper
arrangement of vacuum tubes used as values so that
the surge causes the voltage to be applied to the
cathode, thus starting the ray which photographs
the remaining portion of the wave. It is almost
necessary in this type of work that an electric sweep
be used in place of the magnetic. This is done by
utilizing the horizontal deflecting plates.
The accompanying photographs show the Gen-
eral Electric Cathode ray oscillograph of the de-
partment of Electrical Engineering. In the front
view at the upper right can be seen the vacuum bell
which encloses the fluorescent screen and film
holder. The window for visual observation may be
seen in the side of the bell. At the upper left the
cathode ray tube and the housing enclosing the
tube which contains the deflecting plates is visible.
The cathode is connected to the high tension termi-
nal of the high tension transformer by means of a
water tube resistor. It will be noted that the
cathode ray tube and the deflecting tube are housed
in a shielded box. This is done to remove any
possible effect of stray fields upon the operation of
the machine. At the lower right the panel carrying
the control switches may be seen while above it
and under the vacuum bell is the electric vacuum
gauge which gives an indication of the degree of
vacuum in the bell. In the lower central part is the
control panel of the oscillator used for producing a
timing wave. To the left of the oscillator may be
seen the high tension transformer. In the rear view
the truck that carries the rotary vacuum pump and
synchronous switches is in the foreground. The
vacuum pump is on the left and the synchonous
switches on the right of this truck. At the lower
left end of the main truck may be seen the mercury
vapor pump which is essential for obtaining a high
vacuum in the system. The liquid air trap to its
right is to remove all condensable vapors present in
the vacuum. To the right of this is the oscillator
and above the high tension bushings for applying
the voltage to the deflecting plates may be seen.
Cathode ray oscillography forms an extremely in-
teresting phase of engineering research. The pos-
sibilities in surge voltage studies alone are almost
without limit. In the field when studying natural
surges it is admitted that the problem may be
tedious and trying, strokes are relatively few and
far between when it is necessary to wait for them
to appear. But these studies must be carried on,
at least until it is assured that artificial strokes can
be produced which will duplicate the natural. In
the laboratory the research is much less tedious and
at the same time exceedingly fruitful. Insulation
flashover and breakdown tests on various types of
impulse voltage waves are yielding much valuable
information. The study of arc discharges has been
afforded considerable impetus by the application of
the cathode ray oscillograph. In short, the field is
so broad that it is difficult to visualize the range
of application. Let it suffice to say that the studies
of high speed transients are bound to become more
important and necessary as development proceeds
with the result that the cathode ray oscillograph
will come into its own as a necessary piece of lab-
oratory equipment.

WHEN IS POWER FACTOR
(Continued from page 10)
The power company has a rate schedule stating—
"Either the average Kw. or 80% of the Kv-a, which
ever is larger, will be considered the billing demand
for each period." With a power factor of 0.53 the
manufacturer was paying for 80% of 270 Kv-a or
216 instead of 140, the Kw. load. The installation
of a 120 Kv-a capacitor (electrostatic condenser)
costing approximately $2000 raised the plant power
factor sufficiently to allow the billing to be made
on the Kw. load. The resultant saving in power
bills was $115 per month or $1380 per year. In ad-
dition the necessity of increasing transformer ca-
pacity was removed and the plant voltage raised
from 425 to 460 volts.
Instead of using a capacitor the installation of
synchronous motor drives would have been equally
effective in improving the power factor.
Synchronous motors are made to operate at unity
or leading power factor, depending on the degree
of field excitation and mechanical loading, while
practically all industrial circuits have a lagging
power factor. At no-load a synchronous motor
consumes only the slight amount of power required
for no-load operating conditions, yet furnishes a
large amount of leading reactive Kv-a. to the line,
counteracting the effect of the lagging reactive
Kv-a. supplied to all induction motors, transformers,
electric furnaces, arc welding equipment, or induc-
tive apparatus of any kind in the system. Synchron-
ous motors designed to operate at no load are called
synchronous condensers, and are used where large
amounts of leading reactive Kv-a. are needed.
Consider the effect of low power factor on a 2300
volt, 3 phase transmission line, one mile long, carry-
ing a 200 Kw load at 60 cycles. Assume an allow-
able loss of 5%. At 0.95 P.P. copper wire of 50,000
circular mil section may be used while at 0.60 P.F.
copper wire of at least 132,000 circular mil section
must be used. At 12c per pound the copper for
the lines would cost $315 and $780, respectively. If
50,000 circular mil wire were used at 0.60 P.F. the
power loss would be 12.5%.
Consider a 440 volt, 3 phase line, 400 feet long,
using No. 00 copper wires spaced six inches apart,
and a constant load of 100 Kw. At unity P.F. the
line loss is 1.5 Kw. while at 0.50 P.F. the line loss
is 6.5 Kw. Assuming a cost of two cents per Kw-
Hr. the line loss per year at unity P.F. is $90 while
at 0.50 P.F. the yearly loss is $390
Reactive current has a demagnetizing effect on
the field of an alternator, necessitating more field
current to maintain the rated voltage output at low
power factor than needed at higher power factors.
Figure 1 indicates the costs, ratings, and effi-
ciencies of a 1000 Kv-a, 0.80 P.F., 2400 volt, 3 phase,
60 cycle, 150 R.P. M. alternator, costing approxi-
mately $6500, at various load power factors. The
effect of power factor on the alternator is tremend-
ous. With a unity P.F. load the Kw. capacity is
1100, the efficiency 95%, and the investment per
Kw. is $5.90. With a 0.60 P.F. load the Kw. ca-
pacity is 500, the efficiency 88%, and the investment
per Kw, is $13.10.
Low power factor increases the voltage drop of
the line due to the addition of reactive current,
causing greater voltage fluctuations with changes
of loading, which is highly undesirable in instances
where it is necessary to operate induction motors
connected to that line at constant speed.
Figure 2 shows Kw. capacities and percent regu-
lations of a 600 Kv-a, 2300/230, 3 phase bank of
transformers at various power factors. With an ap-
proximate cost of $2200, efficiency of 98.3%, and
power cost of two cents per Kw-Hr., the power loss
per year taken on a basis of full load Kv-a 3000
hours per year is $1.01 per Kw. at unity P.F. and
$1.70 per Kw. at 0.60 P.F. The investment per Kw.
at unity P.F. is approximately $3.60, and $6.00 at
0.60 P.F.
It must be remembered that a given amount of
correction used for low power factors produces a
greater effect than the same amount of corrective
apparatus produces at higher power factors, in ac-
cordance with the "Law of Diminishing Returns."


Page Thirty-Three
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
For example, to correct the power factor of a sys-
tem from 0.60 to 0.80 requires about 78% of the re-
active Kv-a, required to correct the same system
from 0.90 P.F. to unity P.P., yet the current in the
system is reduced 25% in changing from 0.60 P.F.
Because of this "Law of Diminishing Returns," to
correct the power factor of a system to unity is us-
ually not as desirable as to correct the power factor
to slightly less than unity. In the majority of cases
of lower power factor systems the power factor to
be aimed at that which will give maximum return
on investment in corrective apparatus, is between
0.90 and 0.90.
Analysis of power factor conditions and cor-
rection resolves itself into the following general
procedure. If a fairly high power factor is main-
tained, say above 0.80, and all apparatus in the sys-
tem handles its load satisfactorily, there is no need
to attempt further improvement. If, however, some
part of the system is overloaded, and the power fac-
tor is below 0.80, individual conditions must be
studied to determine what method of correction is
economically advisable. Where short lines or
transformers are overloaded due to low power factor
and no bonus is allowed by the power company for
improvement of the power factor, it is often satis-
factory to increase the size of the lines or capacity
of the transformers without installing additional
apparatus for power factor correction. If power
factor is low, and a substantial bonus is allowed for
improvement of the power factor, the installation of
synchronous motor drives in place of induction
motor drives, or the use of capacitors or synchron-
ous condensers, often yields high return on invest-
ment. Where applicable, the installation of syn-
chronous motor drives is to be preferred in correct-
ing power factor, as they remove the trouble at its
source, and because they serve the double function
of supplying corrective R.Kv-a and driving a me-
chanical load. Where synchronous motors can not
be applied and correction in small or medium
amounts is needed, the installation of a high grade,
oil immersed capacitor, requiring almost no atten-
tion and having no moving parts is desirable. As
illustrated in the foregoing, actual example, the an-
nual return due to savings in power bills alone
amounted to about two thirds of the initial cost of
the capacitor. Where very large amounts of cor-
rection are needed the synchronous condenser is
most economical, the initial cost sometimes being
less than half that of a capacitor supplying the same
amount of corrective RKv-a. However, the syn-
chronous condenser requires the lubrication and at-
tention that is required by any high speed motor.
This type of correction is used by power companies
on long transmission lines.
He was staking his future
on those castings
Even though it was July 4 and a holiday, R. T.
Crane, then a young man, was so eager to see his
tiny new foundry in actual operation that he lighted
the furnace, filled the crucible with metal, and
poured his first castings. When the moulds were
cool,and the first Crane products ready,he studied
and cleaned and polished with inexhaustible care.
The little foundry has grown into the 347 acres
of Crane manufacturing plants. Progress has
brought rows of giant electric furnaces to take
the place of his first crude one. The lightning rod
couplings that he made on that day in 1855 have
been expanded into a line of 33,000 items, meet-
ing every modern valve and fitting need of the
world's industries. But to this day, the example
the founder set of intense personal interest and
pride and care for the quality of each product
remains a distinguishing mark of the Crane
organization.
Just as the founder on that first day felt that his
future rested with the quality of those couplings,
Crane men are trained to feel that their company's
reputation rests upon the quality of each valve
and fitting they turn out.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
THE TECHNIQUE OF HIGH VACUUM
(Continued from page 11)
and are given a motion of translation equal and
parallel to the motion of the mercury vapors and
the condensed mercury, as the mercury drops to the
bottom of the chamber the gaseous molecules are
carried along with it until they reach the exhaust
line G where they are drawn into the fore pumps.
Suitable traps should be installed on both sides of
the vapor pump to prevent the escape of the mer-
cury vapors which would damage the working parts
of the fore pumps and other equipment.
The connecting tubes are generally of glass and
thick rubber tubing. Joints between glass tubes
and rubber tubes are heavily shellaced. Connec-
tions between glass tubing and metal are generally
made with sealing wax. Some special joints are
made directly by sealing special types of glass to
special metals. The most important thing to be
considered in a glass to metal seal is the coefficient
of expansion of the glass and the metal. The ex-
pansion coefficients must be equal or nearly so to
insure a permanently tight joint. All glass joints
must be made carefully and be tested to be sure
that they are free from pin holes or porousness. In
this kind of work great skill is required and often-
times professional glass-blowers or apparatus re-
pair men are hired to do the work.
A great deal of care is necessary in the selection
of tubing for vacuum system. The temperature of
the tubes affects the conductance of the tubes to as
great an extent as the speed of the pumps. There
are many complicated formulas for the calculation
of the conductance of a tube system which must be
thoroughly known before a system can be designed.
The essential points to be considered are tempera-
tures of various parts of the system, types of pumps,
their speeds, capacities, and the resistance offered
by the tubes to the flow of gas.
The entire vacuum system should be joined as far
as possible by fused glass joints and metal to glass
joints because wax and rubber joints prevent the
tubes from being heated sufficiently to drive off sur-
face gases. Leaks can be detected more easily in
glass than in wax and wax has quite a vapor pres-
sure even at temperatures at which the wax is
hard. Vacuum waxes are important but no sys-
tematic study has been made of the properties of
the waxes in use and consequently there has not
been much of any development made on them. Tap
grease used on vacuum apparatus should never
stick nor give off vapor. For this reason, dis-
solved non-vulcanized Para rubber in white vase-
line and paraffin makes the best tap grease.
Leaks are located very easily in glassware by
using a little induction coil which gives a spark of
fair size. One side of the coil is connected to a
metallic part of the system and the other is thor-
oughly insulated except for a brush like end. This
brush is passed over the tubes giving off a fine
brush discharge when a leak is found the discharge
changes to a bright spark. This method is not used
on wax seals nor metallic joints. Leaks in metal
and waxed joints are located by immersion in water
and blowing air into them.
Rubber tubing is not used very often in vacuum
work because of the amount of gases it liberates. In
some places, though, rubber has to be used but it
is generally prepared by boiling it for several hours
in a caustic soda solution and then in distilled water.
Rubber tends to become porous with time but this
can be avoided by coating it with castor oil.
A great deal of work has been done on the elim-
ination of occluded gases from glass and metals.
Investigators agree that the history of the glass or
metals under observation affect the amounts of
these gases. The best way to eliminate them seems
to be some form of heat treatment determined by
the type of glass or metal under test. Other methods
of improving vacua are those in which some sub-
stance is used to absorb these occluded gases and
whatever other gases may remain in the system.
Measuring instruments or pressure gauges cap-
able of measuring pressures as low as one-tenth of
a micron and lower have been developed along with
the pumps and other equipment. The simplest of
these gauges are the ordinary U-tube manometer
shown in Fig. 5 and the McLeod gauge shown in
Fig. 6. The principle of the McLeod gauge con-
sists of the isolation of a known volume of gas V
at an unknown pressure X and the compression of •
this volume of gas into a small volume V at which
the pressure is measured. If P is this pressure, then
by Boyle's Law; X= P(V'+V).
This gauge consists of a bulb A with a narrow
tube B at the top. The volume V is the sum of the
volume of the bulb and the small tube. When the
mercury level is raised the gas in the bulb and tube
is isolated from the rest of the system. At the point
C a further increase in the height of the mercury
level compresses this gas and permits the mercury
to flow into the tube E. When the level of the
mercury in the tube E reaches the point D which is
the end of the small tube B the difference in level
is the pressure on the gas V. These gauges can be
made extremely accurate by choosing the dimen-
sions of the narrow tubes as small as possible.
Their size is limited by the ease with which the
mercury will flow through the tube. These gauges
are not capable of measuring the fluctuations of
pressure over small intervals of time. Some of the
more intricate gauges are the Radiometer gauges,
thermal conductivity gauges, ionization gauges
viscosity manometers and quartz fiber gauges.
Much can be said for each of these gauges but
space does not permit of a satisfactory explana-


Page Thirty-Five
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
tion of any one of them. The ionization gauge is
used quite frequently because of its sensitivity and
rapidity of reading. There is a great deal of work
yet to be done on the development of these gauges
and as the gas in the system affects the gauges to a
great extent it is safe to say that the further de-
velopment work will be carried along with the mi-
cro-analysis of various gases.
A considerable amount of research is being car-
ried on at the present to determine the best and
most practical methods of obtaining a vacuum. To
date the best method seems to be one or even two
rotarv vacuum pumps connected in series, a mole-
cular or condensation pump, liquid air traps at con-
venient places and absorption tubes. Some work has
been done on electrical clean-up but the methods
used are not, as yet, sufficiently standardized to per-
mit description, however it is a well known fact
that the electrical discharge does help in the pro-
duction of a high vacuum.

modern Swedish interior architecture. The skill
with which he used the various natural woods and
metals in combination with Swedish fabrics is a
real revelation to any architect. Swedish crafts-
manship today is probably the best that the world
produces. During the trip both ways on the
"Kungsholm", I enjoyed making a number of
sketches of different details of the interiors, some
of which are reproduced in connection with this
article.
My first visit to Paris in 1922 made a lasting im-
pression on me. The beautiful compositions at
every turn, the small bits of architectural detail here
and there, as well as the grandiose schemes such as
the Champs Elysees, stirred my imagination to the
highest key. And one's imagination must be stim-
ulated before one can make a good sketch. Paris,
to my mind, when one goes abroad on a sketching
tour, should be made one's headquarters. It is the
hub of the wheel. From Paris the railroads radiate
out into all directions and one can reach practically
an}' point on the Continent from Paris without any
difficulty.
Any newcomer to Paris interested in architec-
ture, should live in the Latin Quarter, where there
are many studios for those who wish to make quick
sketches from life, in addition to out-of-door work.
In the art shops of this arrondissement one can find
an unlimited assortment of drawing materials for
sketching. All one needs is the desire. The tools
and the subjects are at every turn in the road.
I make it a practice to carry with me, when I am
abroad, several small sketching books of pocket size.
BRAINS FOR BOILERS
A few years ago when a steam power plant underwent
a heavy load demand, grimy firemen would work feverishly
to keep pace with the cry for more steam. By their back
breaking labor, six men could bring twelve 100 H. P. boilers
from bank to full load in one hour. Coal and air were fed
to the furnaces with little regard to combustion efficiency.
In modern central stations, the conditions are vastly different.
The huge pulverized fuel fired boilers need practically no
human aid when equipped with Bailey Automatic Control.
As the load changes, the correct speed changes are made
on fans, fuel feeders and pulverizers. A 3000 H. P. boiler
can be brought from minimum load to full load in less than
10 minutes time when necessary. Most important, however,
Bailey Meter Control constantly maintains highest com-
bustion efficiency consistent with economical operation.
Modern boilers can think—their brains are the Bailey
Meter Control System.

I never go out without one, whether I plan to
sketch or not, for the simple reason that an archi-
tect is always coming across something in his line
which is worthy of noting, and there is nothing
equal to a note on paper, as compared to a mental
note which is often soon forgotten. Even at the
opera in Paris while in evening clothes, I have often
carried one of my sketch books with me. It is much
like the doctor who never goes out without his
thermometer.
The small pocket-size sketching books which I
refer to measure exactly 5&gt;4 by 8 inches. These
books usually have a blue cover and the paper is a
fairly smooth tecture with a good tooth to it. In
addition to these smaller books, I usually carry a
larger size book of the same stock when I am plan-
ning to make a serious sketch. These come in vari-
ous sizes, the largest being 16^ by 2\1/^ inches.
In making a black and white drawing, I usually
use very soft conte pencils, as well as the soft conte
crayon sticks. The conte crayon works beautifully
on the sketching paper referred to above.
Charcoal is another medium which appeals to me
very much and which adapts itself very well for
large, broad architectural compositions. When us-
ing charcoal one should use a charcoal paper of
good quality. No. 3 Rouget charcoal (fusain) is
probably the best charcoal made in France. Rouget

No. 3, by the way is excellent for making rough
sketches in the drafting room on tracing paper.
There is nothing quite like it. In making my crit-
icisms in the atelier of New York University, I
always use charcoal so as to avoid getting into de-
tail.
When first making sketches out-of-doors, or in-
doors for that matter, the tendency is to get in-
volved in too much detail. One should strive to
catch the mass of the building or monument or
whatever one is sketching, and later introduce the
detail where it is needed.
Water color has been for many years one of the
few mediums used by architects in sketching.
Nothing is more beautiful than a first rate water
color. However, I believe that this medium is being
used less and less in sketching abroad, which is
really too bad. The great advantage of using water
color, of course, is that one thinks in terms of the
color of the compositions as opposed to just a black
and white impression. This is one of the advant-
ages of water color. It keeps the thought of real
color ever before us. However, my own experi-
ence has been that I have never been able to make
any headway using this particular medium, which
is probably the reason I have gone into black and
white so seriously.
I get a great deal of pleasure out of sketching.
We all should sketch as much as possible. It keeps
the mind alert, and stimulates the imagination. It
is just as important for an architect, it seems to me,
to be able to put his conceptions down in lines as it
is for a surgeon to have skill in using a knife.
It is really the architect's language and we should
all try to speak it fluently and skillfully. It keeps
one young, fertile, imaginative. Almost all of the
outstanding architects in this country are able to
sketch and sketch well. I am thinking now of Cass
Gilbert, Van Buren Magonigle, Ralph Walker, Ray-
mond Hood, Henry Hornbostel, etc., etc. All these
men have the ability of putting their vital thoughts
down on paper and as it should be. Cass Gilbert,
after forty years of practice, is still sketching abroad.
He brings back with him every year a half dozen
or more excellent water colors. If you don't be-
lieve me, the next time that you are in New York,
ask to see his collection of originals, and I am sure
he will be glad to take the time to show you what
he has done. We must all speed up with our
sketching, if we hope to keep pace with the men
who are doing the worthwhile things in architec-
ture today.
BRICK MAKING

rived a pretty good example of brick advertising.
The Egyptians apparently prized the brick indus-
try as high as their Babylonian predecessors, for
they ascribed the art to Nun, the oldest and wisest
of their gods, and Pharaoh monopolized the busi-
ness by having his name stamped on the product.
Egyptian brick making, however, never reached the
degree of perfection attained by the Babylonians.
Reference is made in the Bible, in the fifth chap-
ter of Exodus, to the manufacture of Brick, par-
ticularly as it refers to the slavery of the Israelites
by the Egyptians. It recites that the Egyptians, to
place a further burden upon their Israelitish slaves,
refused to longer supply them straw for its man-
ufacture, but instead made them gather it them-
selves and at the same time make as many bricks
as usual. The question has often been raised as to
why the Israelites used straw in this manufacture
and why it was such a hardship to have to make
brick without it. Many answers to this question
have been put forth, but the generally accepted rea-
son, by theologians, ceramists and manufacturers'
of clay wares, is, that this was necessary because
the clay that was used was taken from the river
bottoms and was a very fat plastic clay. This clay
after being hand moulded to brick, was dried in the
sun and was quite apt to crack to pieces because
it formed what ceramists call a tight, or loose, body
and dried very fast. The straw was therefore added
to help loosen up the body of the brick, holding the
clay together until it dried and facilitating that
drying without cracking and of course giving some
reinforcement in strength. The use of straw was
thought by some to have been used to enable the
brick to burn more readily, but such was not the
case, because this was in the days before burning
the brick was the general practice and this same
condition holds good today in extreme southern,
and in lower, California, and old Mexico where they
still use unburned or abode brick. The brick are
made by hand and enough straw, or sometimes hay,
is used to hold the mass together so the adobe brick
can be handled and placed in the wall. Clay in
America and other lands generally are of a su-
perior quality and did not need, even under first
crude methods of manufacture, this straw for bond-
ing the unburned or green brick, and the practice
was therefore discontinued because of other meth-
ods of handling it.
Europe naturally acquired the art of making,
and using brick from the Romans, who left splen-
did and extensive remains of brickwork in nearly
every part of their wide domain. The Baths of
Caracalla, the Basilica of Constantine at Rome and
the spectacular dome of St. Sophia's at Byzantium,
or Constantinople, are striking examples of Roman

practice in handling brick. After the Barbarian in-
vasions had subsided and the Church had suc-
ceeded in introducing' some semblance of order into
European society, architecture, especially with the
thrilling times of the Crusades, began a brilliant ca-
reer in the so-called Romanesque and Gothic
periods. Here brick found its useful plane in art
combined with service, and in countries where clay
was abundant, as in northern Italy, southern
France, northern Germany, and the Low countries,
extensive brick building was carried on. In Spain,
the Moors also revealed their mastery of the craft
in such structures as the Alhambra at Granada, and
the Mosque, (now Cathedral,) of Cordova. During
the great Gothic period, from the thirteenth to the
fifteenth centuries, brick entered upon its palmy-
days and was freely and fearlessly used, with most
effective and artistic results, notably in northern
Europe where the wealthy and growing burgher
cities used bricks to build many a splendid city-
gate, church, town or guild hall and mansion.
In England, bricks were first made by the Ro-
mans during their three and a half centuries of oc-
cupancy there. The home industry, however, does
not appear until the thirteenth century, and did not
reach perfection until the time of Henry (1509-
1547) when it was probably accomplished under
Flemish influence. In 1666, the great fire trans-
formed London from a wooden to a brick town
,
and gave a great spur to the brick industry. It
remained, however, for the days of Queen Anne
and the Georges, in the eighteenth century, to in-
troduce a vogue for brick that almost eradicated
the demand for other kinds of materials and re-
sulted in the erection of those fine country houses
which, scattered throughout England today, are so
representative of substantial comfort and dignity.
In modern construction English builders have main-
tained a fine sense of the architectural values in
sound and beautiful brickwork.
America, too, has its brick antiquities, The Span-
ish Conquistadores discovered crude but excellent
adobe brickwork in Peru and Mexico and further
developed it in their own settlements. In North
America, probably the first brick buildings erected
were in St. Augustine, Florida, where are found
still standing two or three small buildings, said to
have been erected in 1529 from brick brought from
Spain. In other section, the first brick houses were
built of material brought from Holland or England,
although in Virginia, as early as 1611, and in Massa-
chusetts, as early as 1629, the domestic industry
was established. Naturally, European, especially
English, practice was closely followed. The Colo-
nial days produced fine examples of brick archi-
tecture from New England to Virginia. Among
these are many old, well known and historical build-
ings, which are still standing, in good repair, and
being used for various purposes. There is the old
Governor Craddock house in Medford, Massa-
chusetts, built for Massachusetts' first Governor in
1632, still being used as a residence; Old Swedes
Church in Philadelphia built in 1698; Christ Church
in Philadelphia built in 1727; Independence Hall in
Philadelphia where the Declaration of Independ-
ence was signed in 1776. built in 1734; St. Paul's
Church in Philadelphia built in 1750; Faneuil Hall
in Boston, where plans for American Independence
were first laid, built in 1764; Carpenter's Hall in
Philadelphia, where the first Continental Congress
convened in 1774, built in 1770; Congress Hall in
Philadelphia where George Washington was in-
augurated for his second term as first President of
the United States and where Congress sat from
1789 to 1889, built in 1788, and many other in all
sections of the old Colonial districts and all built of
Common Brick. Even here in Detroit, we have
some wonderful examples of old Common Brick
buildings and while not so ancient or so historical
as those I have mentioned located in the East, we
do find many approximating 100 years old and still
in use. East Jefferson Avenue has many such
buildings along its length for a mile or two from
Woodward avenue and while now mostly painted
or weathered so that close inspection is necessary
to tell it, it will be found many are of Common
Brick and in a fine state of preservation. Other

dential sections have also many examples of Com-
mon Brick houses in fine state of preservation. In
fact many of these old buildings which are fast be-
ing torn down to make way for modern progress,
contain Common Brick which is salvaged and is
now in great demand for architectural results in
outside walls and brings out beautiful effects. Not
many structural materials can thus be used again
and again and still retain their strength and util-
ity and with an added beauty from age.
In the nineteenth century, up to 1880, American
Brick building was largely confined to the use of
Common Brick for average construction, or for
backing stone-face walls. Since then a changing in-
dividual and national taste has secured various ar-
tistic effects in the brick wall by the use of special-
ly manufactured face brick which are now produced
in a myriad variety of beautiful color tones and tex-
tures and which have been used by leading archi-
tects to achieve much that is distinctive in building-
design and construction. But the pendulum is
swinging back again and many of the leading arch-
itects of this country are now once more specifying
Common Brick for exterior purposes as well as for
back up and interior purposes, finding in its tex-
ture, just those things which bring out the best
architectural effects, which so endeared it to past
generations, but which for a time, had been lost
sight of.
Mineralogically, clay consists of many different
mineral fragments, some of them fresh, others in
all stages of decay, and presenting chemically many
different compounds, such as oxides, carbonates,
silicates, hydroxides, etc.; and of colloidal material
which may be of either organic or mineral char-
acter.
Clay deposits, however, vary so greatly in physi-
cal condition and in chemical composition that it is
difficult to group them in fixed classes. Also, the
methods employed in working days, combined with
the almost innumerable uses to which different
kinds of clay are put, make it necessary to treat clay
according to its individual requirements and to the
requirements of the particular branch of trade for
which it is intended. The primary object of the
clayworker is to use the clay at his disposal, and re-
peted analyses of clays used in making brick, are
seldom necessary. Frequent tests are, however, es-
sential to successful practice in the working of re-
fractory clay, and of clays used in the production of
porcelain and other high class wares. In fact, the
closest possible attention is imperative in the manu-
facture of the best wares, not only as regards the
clays used, but also as regards the other materials
employed, without which the clay is practically use-
less to the potter.
Among the different clays known are koalin, a
white burning clay; Ball clay, used in making
whiteware; fire clay used for fire brick and etc.; and
capable of standing 3038 F. in burning; stone-
ware clay for pottery work; terra cotta clay; sewer
pipe clay; common brick clay; face brick clay;
enameled brick clay; paving brick clay; slip clay for
glazing; gumbo clay for railroad ballast; retort clay
for gas retorts; pot clay for class pots; pipe clay for
smoking pipes; cement clay; paper clay; mineral
paint clay etc.; and etc.
Clay in Detroit territory is Common Brick clay
but of an extra good quality for making tough build-
ing brick, with a reasonable amount of absorption,
as shown by the test of our manufactured mate-
rials. Its crushing and transverse strength is high
for "medium" Brick according to standards set
forth by the American Society Testing Materials
and approaches very nearly the standards set tor
"hard" brick. Its crushing strength averages 2V12
pounds per square inch; its transverse strengtn
averages 855.3 pounds per square inch; and its
absorption averages 13.75%. Brick has been made
in Detroit and vicinity, lor over 1UO years and its
manufacture today is by the most modern methods.
The clay is dug trom the beds by huge steam,
electric or gasoline propelled shovels, dumped into
small cars on rails which are then pushed by gaso-
line engines to the bottom of an incline, where cars

are hitched to a cable and drawn to the top of the
brick plant. There the clay is dumped from the cars
into a large hopper where it is mixed with water
and thoroughly "pugged" or kneaded by large re-
volving knives and blades, through several proc-
esses, until it becomes thoroughly smooth, fine and
plastic. It is then forced through a machine in
which wooden molds have been placed thoroughly
sanded, and into which molds, the exact size of the
finished product, (2% inches thick by 3^4 inches
wide by 8 inches long) the clay is pressed. The
molds are automatically ejected from the machine
and turned over, thus dumping the freshly molded
"green" brick on to an iron "pallet" or plate, which
is taken along on a movable chain belt into the "dry
room". There it is taken from the belt, (the pallet
with seven brick on it) and placed on racks made of
steam pipe. Heat from the steam pipes drys the
brick is from 15 to 18 hours, after which it is placed
in the "kiln" or furnace made of brick, and burned
at a temperature of about 1800 degrees Farenheit,
for five or six days and nights, until it is thoroughly
hardened and all deletorous matter burned from it.
Oil is used for fuel and is sprayed into the kilns by
a sort of forced blow torch process, wherein live
steam is mixed. "Green" brick are a clay color, gray
or drab with a blue cast. Burned brick are red,
having changed in color by the burning of the iron
content of the clay.

It may be operated at a fuel cost of 1/3 to 1/6 that of
an equivalent steam locomotive. There are no standby losses.
It requires very little water, and, therefore, eliminates
costly watering stations and the high boiler maintenance
traceable to bad water conditions.
For small branch lines and congested city yards, it makes
possible the elimination of coaling plants, ash pits, turntables,
expensive roundhouses, and hostHng service—all required for
steam locomotives.
Its availability for service is approximately 80/t, or

Its cost of maintenance is approximately one'half that of

It provides higher tractive effort at starting and low

In operation it is practically noiseless and smokeless.
Its oil engine can be loaded full at all speeds—a factor

OXWELDING
SIMPLIFIES PIPING DESIGN
THE laying out of a piping system is materially
simplified by oxwelding. Where this method of
jointing is used, plans are not governed by the availa-
bility of standard fittings and the avoidance of specials.
Oxwelding does not change the general design fea-
tures. Size of pipe, method of suspension, provision
for expansion and contraction and location of turns,
branch connections, valves and other fittings are the
same as for other types of construction. Welded joints
and fittings are merely substituted to obtain increased
compactness, economy and serviceability.

Diphenyl—A New Heating Medium
By PROFESSOR WALTER L. BADGER
Department of Chemical Engineering
THE recent development of diphenyl as a
heating medium has attracted much attention.
This attention has been focussed, not only on
the things that have already been done, but more
particularly on the many further possibilities of this
remarkable material. A paper by C. C. Monrad in
the May, 1930, is-
sue of The Technic
discussed the devel-
opment of an ex-
perimental boiler
and the use of diph-
enyl heat for con-
centrating caustic
soda. This paper
will be a more gen-
eral description of
the whole project.
There has been a
great deal of con-
fusion regarding
what diphenyl is
and how it is used,
more particularly
regarding the sec-
ond of these ques-
tions. Diphenyl is
a material that is
stable at high tem-
peratures, is put in
a boiler instead of
water, and the vapors produced by boiling it are
used just as steam is used for all kinds of indirect
heating. Conceivably, these vapors might also be
expanded through a turbine to generate power, but
the advantages of diphenyl in this respect are not
FIG.
nearly so great as they are when it is used as a
heating medium.
The usefulness of diphenyl as a heating medium
is exclusively in those temperature ranges that are
too high to be reached by steam at convenient pres-
sures. Because of the expense of the diphenyl it-
________^__^_^^____ self and the special
"equipment in which
it is used, there is
no advantage in
using diphenyl at
temperatures where
steam can be used
at moderate pres-
sures, nor in the
£• higher tempera-
ture ranges if some
of the other ad-
vantages to be
enumerated later
are of no signifi-
cance.
In the past, most
of the development
of new substances
has come about by
a new substance
becoming available
at reasonable
prices. Then a

search would be
made for suitable uses. Within recent years this
procedure has been reversed. Such enormous num-
bers of compounds can be made, and the general
properties connected with particular features of
chemical composition have become so well known,

that it is possible to specify a set of properties that
a desirable substance should have, decide what type
of compound is the most likely to produce those
properties, and then proceed to find methods for
manufacturing this substance on the commercial
scale. This is the case in the present instance.
It has long been known that for many processes a
heating medium in the form of a saturated vapor,
but at a higher temperature than steam, was de-
sirable. The only possible substances were mer-
cury, among the inorganic compounds, and com-
pounds containing two or more benzine rings
among the organic compounds. Mercury, in spite
of the large amount of work clone by the General
Electric Company, in attempting to develop it for
steam power cycles, is considered out of the ques-
tion because of the
exceedingly poison-
ous nature of the
vapor. The field was
therefore restricted
to organic com-
pounds.
The substance
diphenyl, whose for-
mula is C,,Hr,—C,,H-
was selected as prob-
ably fulfilling the de-
sired conditions.
This substance had
been mentioned in
the chemical literature, but had never been anything
but a laboratory curiosity. It was found that the
only place it could be obtained was in a laboratory
that specialized in the preparation of rare chemicals
for research work, and some preliminary work was
done on a sample obtained from them at a price
of approximately $25 a pound. Today this material
is in regular commercial production and is avail-
able in carload lots at $.40 a pound. It is manu-
factured by the Swann Chemical Co., at Anniston,
Alabama, by a fairly simple process. As further
commercial use is developed and the production is
enlarged it is possible that the price may be still
lower.
The first step in the investigation was to deter-
mine or calculate the thermal properties needed for
engineering calculations. This work was difficult
and expensive, especially the determinations of spe-
cific heat. Values have been agreed on, and tables
of the thermal properties of diphenyl, similar to the
steam tables, have been issues. The only work not
yet done is the determination of the specific heat of
superheated diphenyl vapor. This would only be
necessary for the calculation of power cycles, and is
unnecessary for the calculations involved in the use
of diphenyl as a heating medium. Some typical

The first use that was suggested for this high
temperature heating medium was the distillation
of lubricating oils. Inasmuch as this development
was already under way at the plant of the Indian
Refining Co., this was not taken up in the Univer-
sity laboratories.
The next thing that occurred as a possible use
for diphenyl was the concentration of caustic soda.
Caustic soda is an important industrial chemical
made on a very large scale by a considerable num-
ber of plants. It is produced in the form of a dilute
solution, which is concentrated to about 50% in
ordinary steam heated evaporators. As the solution
becomes stronger, the boiling point of the solutions
increases until a 50% solution boils at about 290°F.
at atmospheric pres-
sure. Further con-
centration increases
the boiling point so
rapidly that in most
cases the 50% solu-
tion is sent to direct
fired cast iron posts
and evaporated to
dryness. In other
plants, by means of
recently developed
equipment it has
been found possible
to concentrate in
steam heated evaporators to about 70%, but even
so, the finishing must take place in direct fired pots.
These pots are expensive and clumsy. Their ther-
mal efficiency is very slow, and the operation is a
slow one. It seemed that an evaporator heated by
diphenyl should make it possible to carry the so-
lution to 98% or 99%, thus not only cutting down
the number of pots required, and the length of time
the solution would be in the pots, but would great-
ly increase the fuel economy of the process.
The boiling points of strong solutions of caustic
soda are not very well known, and Figure 4 shows
two sets of determinations found in the literature.
The 100% point on Gerlach's curve is obviously in
error because the boiling point of pure 100% NaOH
is about 2000°F. Some recent determinations, how-
ever, in the range from 70 to 90%, have shown that
the boiling point may be between that given by
Gerlach and that given by Von AntropofT &amp; Som-
mer. When this is compared with the properties of
diphenyl shown in the preceding table, it would
seem that diphenyl at pressures of from 150 to 200
Ibs. gage should suffice to carry caustic soda to
nearly 99%.
The problem of handling these extremely hot and
extremely concentrated solutions of sodium hyrox-

ide promised to be a very difficult one. Consequent-
ly all the attention was put on the evaporator and a
relatively simple laboratory boiler was installed;
with the idea that the evaporation problems would
be the more difficult ones and that the design of a
commercial diphenyl boiler could very well wait un-
til the more serious problems were solved. The
work of concentration of caustic soda was carried
to a successful conclusion and is described in de-
tail in the paper by Monrad previously referred to.
Although various minor difficulties appeared they
were all overcome and caustic soda was successfully
concentrated to
somewhere between
98% and 99%,
using at the end
diphenyl at about
150 Ibs. gage.
The next prob-
lem was to design
a commercial di-
phenyl boiler. The
design of the small
laboratory boiler
had been deter-
mined by consid-
erations of sim-
plicity and expedi-
ency. The Indian
Refining Co. had
developed a diphe-
nyl boiler, but their
units had certain
features that
seemed susceptible
of improvement. In
particular, their de-
sign called for at
least 60 ft. of head
room, and the in-
stallation of a
waste-heat steam
boiler was neces-
sary to give reason-
able thermal effici-
ency. These fea-
tures were not nec-
of pipe enclosed in the convection section of a gas
heated furnace. These tubes are made of ordinary
carbon steel and are equipped with oil-pipe-still type
of return bends. The last pass is in the radiation
section and consists of chrome-nickel-steel tubes
covered with carborundum rings. The last pass dis-
charges into the vapor drum B where liquid and
vapor separate; the vapor passing off by the pipe C,
and the liquid returning to the circulation pump D.
The boiler built in the laboratory had to be as small
as possible and yet retain the features of commer-
cial design. It carries only three banks of tubes in ^^^^ parallel, and is

to the high boil-

be disadvantages in a great majority of cases.
It had been shown that a diphenyl boiler must
have forced circulation of the diphenyl to prevent
possible decomposition in the stagnant film and in
pockets. It was also desired to produce a boiler that
could be erected in the head room available in an
ordinary factory type of building. After considerable
discussion the boiler shown in Figure 3 was de-
signed and built. Diphenyl is pumped into a feed
drum A, from which it passes through three lengths
enough to say definitely whether or not this design
will have to be modified in practice. The principal
features to be determined are the relation between
velocity of circulation, rate of evaporation, and pos-
sible decomposition of the diphenyl, especially in the
top bank of tubes, which are exposed to direct radia-
tion. This work is going on in the laboratory at the
present time.
A little over a year and a half ago, the Utilities
Research Commission of Chicago asked the Engi-
neering Research Department if they could suggest
any means by which gas could be used in melting

and processing tars and asphalts. They had in mind
particularly the handling of liquid asphalt for im-
pregnating felt in the manufacturing of roofing
paper and shingles. The temperature necessary is
too high to be obtained conveniently by saturated
steam. Most plants use direct fire heated apparatus,
but because of the viscosity of the asphalt it be-
comes overheated in the vicinity of the flame, which
results in the formation of coke. This greatly slows
down the rate of heat transfer and necessitates peri-
odical cleaning. The use of diphenyl was suggested
and an appropriation was made to study this prob-
lem. An experimental set up was built in the lab-
oratoriesin __^^^^^^_^_^__^_^__^^^
which asphalt ii
could be pump-
ed through a
pipe surround-
ed by diphenyl
vapor and the
rate of heat
transfer meas-
u r e d. This
work is now
complete, and
it has shown
that the rates
of heat trans-
fer are very
high compared
to any other
existing meth-
od, but the
maximum tem-
perature exist-
ing at any point
is low enough
so that there
apparently i s
no danger whatever of carbon formation or fouling
of the heating surfaces. This problem is now wait-
ing the completion of the diphenyl boiler to be put
into actual practice.
A considerable number of other projects are being
discussed, involving the application of diphenyl heat
to a considerable variety of problems in the chemi-
cal industries where temperatures between 500°
and 800° F. must be maintained and controlled ac-
curately. Another project that seems to offer con-
siderable possibilities, but on which no work has
been done as yet, is the use of the diphenyl as a
heating medium for reheating steam between stages
in turbine operation. New possibilities for the use
of diphenyl heat are occuring almost every week.
In considering the possibilities of diphenyl and
its advantages, one must compare it with the other
possible means of heating in the temperature range
between, say, 500° and 850°F. The other possibili-
ties are saturated steam, superheated steam, hot oil,
or direct fire. Under the head of direct fire is also
to be understood hot flue gases at the proper tem-
perature.
Saturated steam is out of the question, because
at 500°F. its pressure is 680 Ibs. per square inch
absolute. At 600° it is 1454 Ibs. while beyond 700'
there cannot be any such thing as saturated steam;
because the critical point of water is at 706~F. and
above this temperature water vapor is a permanent
gas. While it is by no means impossible to design
equipment to stand pressures from 700 to 3300 Ibs.,
such apparatus is much more expensive and much more difficult

It should be
noted that :n

ting heat
from the heat-
ing medium to
the metal wall
of the apparat-
us there is a
thermal resist-
ance which is
usually meas-
ured in terms
of the film co-
efficient. It is
well known
that the con-
densation of a
saturated vapor results in the highest possible film
coefficients. Thus, when saturated steam is con-
densed on a metal wall, the rate of heat transfer is
from 2000 to 4000 B.t.u. per square foot, per hour,
per degree Fahrenheit. In this case the resistance is
practically all in the film of condensed steam that ad-
heres to the metal. When a permanent gas or su-
perheated steam is transmitting heat under the same
conditions, the rate of heat transfer will be from 1
to 10 in the same units. This is because the prin-
cipal thermal resistance is a film of stagnant gas ad-
hering to the metal wall, and the thermal conductiv-
ity of this film is very low.
In the light of these considerations it will appear
at once that superheated steam, direct fire, or flue
gases are distinctly inferior to diphenyl in that they
have extremely low coefficients of heat transfer.
Heat transfer from condensing diphenyl to a metal
wall is not so high as in condensing steam because

Relationship Between Law and
Engineering
By PROF. WALTER C. SADLER
Associate Professor of Railroad Engineering
A
X analysis of the proper relationship of en-
gineering and law, necessitates a consider-
ation of the different branches of the two
professions. Thus, the following fields of endeavor
appear open to a man with an education in both
professions.
1. Professional lawyer, with engineering back-
ground.
2. Consulting Engineer, trained in the law.
3. Professional engineer
with a good understanding of ^^^^^^^^^
the law.
The Professional Lawyer
The professional lawyer
w i t h an engineering back-
ground will probably find the
most interesting and lucrative
field in patent law, corporation
law, and utility law. His engi-
neering background will en-
able him to have a better un-
derstanding of the facts in his
case. He can segregate the
irrelevant from the relevant
and make a clearer presenta-
tion of his entire problem. This
situation may be explained by
a few definite examples. In a
patent infringement case, the
fine distinction in characteris-
tics between two machines are
clearest to a person really un-
derstanding the engineering
principles governing those ma-
chines. A decade or two ago a
a large steel company was
faced with patent litigation, and =
the lawyer who secured a fa-
vorable verdict found it profitable to spend an entire
year in the study of the details of the manufacture
of steel. As a reward he became the chief executive
of one of our leading steel corporations. "He knew
his case".
General counsel for gas, telephone, and electric
light companies have a constant series of problems
arising where an engineering background is of great
value. Take the frequent situations of merger of
small corporations with the parent concern. The
minor company has certain machinery and a plant
THE Engineering profession
has so grown in the last few
years that today it is in con-
tact with every phase of business
and public life. The technicali-
ties of law have always played an
important part in the business
world and today the engineer
finds himself faced with its
workings. A practical knowledge
of law has become a part of the
engineer's equipment. Professor
Sadler is a capable man to discuss
the relation that exists between
the professions of law and engi-
neering.
Mr. Sadler took his engineering
degree at Illinois and completed
his graduate work at Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology
and the Michigan Law School.
He has been connected with many
large construction projects both
in Europe and the far west.

near future.

which must become a part of the larger concern;
the minor company has patent rights which may be
of merely nominal value to it, yet of great value
to the parent corporation. Or, again, a contract
of merger may be drawn so that it will not infringe
the spirit of the anti-trust laws. A thorough engi-
neering training would be of great value to the
lawyer engaged in this work.
And finally, let us examine some of the prob-
lems facing the lawyer in the
^^^^^^^^= railroad field. A general coun-
sel for one of the large rail-
roads must have a most thor-
ough understanding of the
construction and operation of
railroad. Consider the regula-
tion of rates by various gov-
ernment agencies. The Minne-
sota Rate Case is a litigation in
point. The state endeavored to
establish rates on inter-state
shipments, and the legal point
raised was whether such rates
were confiscatory. The engi-
neering problem raises a defi-
nite question of fact, to be de-
termined on its merits. Is a
reduction of passenger rates
by 33%, and of general com-
modities by 7%, reasonable
under the particular circum-
stances of the case? The engi-
neer must find a logical method
of allocating the costs of con-
struction and operation be-
tween freight and passenger
^^^^^^^^^ service, in order to state what
is a reasonable rate for freight,
and what for passenger. The general counsel must
understand their engineering problems as well as
the technical legal issues raised. Passing notice
should be taken of the engineering problems be-
hind the legal issues involved in the Recapture
Clause of the Transportation Act of 1920, where
the United States plans to take one-half of the ex-
cess profits of the railroads. Mention might be
made of the engineering problems involved in the
consolidation of all the railroads into nineteen com-
peting systems. The field is hardly scratched, yet it

Flight Training in I . S. Navy
By HOWARD H. BOYS, '3IE
TWO years ago in June, twelve University of
Michigan students obtained appointments in
the Naval Reserve and were sent to the
Navy's flying school at Pensacola, Florida. Last
summer, fourteen received the coveted appoint-
ments and this June as many as eighteen graduat-
ing seniors will make their bid for their Navy wings
in the best equipped and well organized flying
school in the coun-
try.
Flight training pre-
sents an interesting
study when it is com-
pared with the develop-
ment of the aviation in-
dustry. The pioneers in
aviation not only had to
design and build their
own planes, gliders or
airships, but had to
teach themselves how-
to fly the flimsy crates.
Few of the earliest ex-
periments were built on
any sort of sound engi-
neering data and any-
thing might be expected
to happen once they
were in the air. Even
Glenn Curtiss o r the
Wright brothers prob-
ably did their share of
worrying about the
outcome of the initial
flight. And the same
thing probably applied
to the early Naval stu-
ADVANCEI) FLIGHT FORMATION OF FIGHTERS
HIGH IN THE SKY ABOVE PENSACOLA
vicled enough altitude could be obtained for an
initial dive. Included in the terms of the contract
was the stipulation that a Naval officer should be
taught to fly each plane, whether the officer liked it
or not. As a result, former Lieutenants Ellyson,
Rogers and Towers were the first Naval officers to
qualify as aviators under the rule of the Aeronauti-
cal Club of America.
During the early pe-
riod of aviation there
were few mechanics
available (Lindbergh
hadn't made his famous
flight and people in gen-
eral couldn't agree that
there was a future for
aviation) and even up to
May, 1912, there were
only six enlisted men as-
signed to aviation duty.
All major overhauling
and repairing had to be
done by the officers.
At this time the air
station was located at
Annapolis but was sent
to Guantanamo, Cuba,
for the w inter. You
could do that with an air
station in those days. In
spite of the fact that the
station was in Cuba, sev-
eral additional officers
were qualified as Naval
aviators, and two new
ships were added to the
equipment. In the
dents before their first solo hops. As a matter of
fact, a great number of students still worry about
the outcome of the first solo and with good cause, too.
The Navy Department first pricked up its ears
toward aviation in January, 1911, when Capt. W. I.
Chambers was given duty in connection with the
study of aviation. Later in the spring the Wright
brothers agreed to set aside their hundreds of other
orders and build a fast ship for the government. It
was to be a fast landplane with a modern four cyl-
inder, 32 horsepower engine driving two propellors.
The Curtis company also agreed to disrupt their
production schedule and build two seaplanes to be
powered with 40 and 80 horsepower engines, re-
spectively. The 80 H.P. job was a marvel of the
time and boasted of tremendous speed, which was
estimated to be around sixty miles an hour, pro-
meantime a board appointed by the Navy depart-
ment met in Washington to settle upon a satisfac-
tory site for the establishment of a permanent naval
air station. The board decided upon the reopening
of the navy yard at Pensacola. which was later to
become known as the "mother-in-law of all naval
aviators". The air station was again transferred
and the LI.S.S. Mississippi was assigned as the sta-
tion ship for the housing of personnel and supply-
ing power to the machine shops in the yard. The
buildings were opened up, tent hangers erected and
aviation training began under former Lieut. Towers.
The equipment of the school now consisted of
three old Curtiss flying boats, three new Curtiss
boats, two Curtiss pontoon type planes, two Wrright
pontoon planes and a Burgess flying boat. (The
pontoon type planes could not really be called sea-

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
planes ;is we use the word today.) All the Curtiss
planes were equipped with OXX-2 motors and the
Wrights with 4-cyl. Sturtevant engines. Train-
ing was well under way and, as usual, some sort of
interruption was due to occur and the outbreak
around Vera Cruz and Tatnpico served the purpose.
As a result operations were suspended while the
planes were sent to Yera Cruz between April and
June of 1914.
In the summer of 1914, when the World War
broke out, three _^^_^^_^^^__^^_^^^^^_
aviation officers
were detailed as
naval attaches and
it was through
these sources that
information was
obtained to aid in
the design of a
new type of
training ship. This
plane was known
as the N-9 and
was m u c h the
same as the JX-4
(commonly known
as the Jenny) but
e~q nipped with
floats instead of
land gear.
During this
period appropria-
tions for aviation
were very small.
It was often nec-
essary for officers
engaged in flying
to pay out of their
own pockets for
gas, oil and spare
parts if they
wished to con-
tinue flying. The
first real class in
aviation consisted
of a group of ten
naval and marine officers ordered to Pensacola in
1915. The training syllabus at this.time depended
entirely on the ideas of the ofiicer in charge, and
was not always safe or satisfactory. The next two
years saw a definite change and a uniform training
method was adopted.
The United States entered the War in April,
1917, with one hundred naval aviators and a crying
need for many more, which resulted in the establish-
ing of other training bases throughout the country.
The courses at these bases were much the same,
usually consisting of as few hours of instruction as
SQUADRON I BEACH AS VIEWED FROM THE
OBSERVATION TOWER
possible to solo a student and then turning him loose
to instruct himself as best he could. Later on, when
the cry for flyers became louder, the students were
given their wings and they in turn became in-
structors for others, often times having as little as
two or three hours solo. Today the sensible young
pilot would not care to take the responsibility of
carrying a passenger until he has had at least
sixty hours, and the instructors are men who have
had hundreds of hours in the air.
_ The plan of
"training Naval
Reserves to be-
come Naval Avia-
tors and officers
was adopted in
1925. At first, the
flying was given
in two three-
month periods
coming in suc-
cessive summers,
but this was soon
changed and the
course is now
completed in nine
months of con-
tinuous flying. In
the former sylla-
bus stress w a s
laid on bombing
and the flying of
large patrol boats,
but this has now
been changed so
that the student
becomes more fa-
miliar with the
modern ships and
their use with the
fleet.
Today, the Na-
val Air Station at
Pensacola, Flor-
ida, is the most
complete air train-
ing base of the country. It stands second to none
in its widely varied work and is a model for many
commercial as well as foreign military flying
schools. Not only is the art of manipulating a plane
in the air obtained but a thorough knowledge of
motors, plane structure, airology, navigation, bomb-
ing, gunnery, scouting and radio are acquired.
At present the work is divided into five training
Squadrons. In the first squadron (Squadron I) the
student must become intimately acquainted with
the flying of an elementary seaplane. Upon his ar-
rival he is assigned to an instructor who will be his

Office Building Planning
By JAMES It. NEWMAN, A. I. A.
COMPRESSING a description of the essen-
tials of office building planning and the
architect's function in the picture into a
short article is akin to the recent writing of the
History of the United States —
in fifty to one hundred words.
The plans of a large diversi-
fied tenancy office building to-
day are the product of round
table discussions at which are
present the architect, with va-
rious solutions of the problem,
the engineers with technical
knowledge, the realtor who
knows the market demand, the
builder who knows the costs,
the owner and his bankers who
determine the ultimate limit
of expenditure and financial
scheme. This group, through
intensive study of many sites,
involving the preparation of
many preliminary schemes and
tentative financial set-ups
showing the ultimate net re-
turns upon the equity, finally
selects one found satisfactory
for development. The latter
part of this picture may be
eliminated if a property owner
desires the improvement of a
particular site.
The functions of these agents
have been discussed in previ-
ous articles, and the architect
alone is being considered here,
dealing with a particular site.
A prominent New York
builder recently said the archi-
tect "should know everything,"
but actually he is exceptional if he has a good gen-
eral knowledge of the field of operations of each
of the experts noted above, and the requisite techni-
cal knowledge in his own much rammified field, so
. . that he can intelligently lead
the discussion to a definite so-
lution. He must necessarily
know land values, approxi-
mate labor and material costs,
something of financing, oper-
ating costs, rentals, shifting
centers of business and resi-
dential population, etc. With
this general knowledge and
background, it is more nearly
certain that the finished proj-
ect will represent a true eco-
nomic development of the
site, an investment which not
only is an advantage to the
owner but a benefit to the com-
munity.
Zoning restrictions are of
primary importance. They ap-
ply in some of the larger cities,
and their tendency is to spread,
because otherwise, misguided,
intensive and often grasping
individual development may
lead to harmful results to the
community. When a lot is
zoned, as in New York City, so
that it is possible to build up
on the street lot lines only to a
certain altitude, and then above
this point the building must re-
cede according to a definite

is no zoning restriction. In the

Structural Development of a Large
Modern Building
By W. S. WOLF
"X"T TTTT HEN the preliminary sketches are
\\/ started for a large modern building, the
» » structural engineer is often called upon
to answer a number of general questions. What
kind of a foundation will the building require? Will
certain proposed architec- ^
tural features greatly in-
crease the cost of the
structural work? About
what will be the structural
steel tonnage? Approxi-
mately how much depth
will be required for certain
large girders or trusses?
Is it practical to leave out
certain columns in the
lower stories? Is the cast
of certain proposed spans
prohibitive, etc.?
As the architectural
sketches develop the gen-
eral scheme of the struc-
tural frame should be
roughed out and certain
unusual conditions studied.
It is desirable not to go
too fast with the structural
drawings at this time be-
cause there are apt to be
numerous architectural
changes which might re-
quire considerable work to
be done over again. On
the other hand it is im-
portant that the structural
engineer keep in touch with
the job and have the gen-
eral scheme of framing in
mind so that he can give THE TYPICAL FLOOR
the architectural men ap-
proximate sizes and see
that reasonable provision
is made and space allowed in the architectural lay-
out for the structural frame.
As soon as the architectural drawings have de-
veloped to the place where the danger of extensive
changes seems remote the time is ripe for starting
the working drawings for the frame of the building
and they should be pushed as rapidly as possible so
that they will be finished approximately at the same
time as the architectural drawings.
^^^^^^^^^^^^_ However it often hap-
pens that the owner wishes
to let a foundation con-
tract or a steel contract, or
both, ahead of the general
contract, in order to save
time or take advantage of
lower steel prices. Such a
procedure is often neces-
sary but it usually in-
creases the cost of the
structural drawings by re-
quiring that they be push-
ed ahead of the architec-
tural and mechanical draw-
ings which means that the
structural engineers do not
have sufficient information
to work efficiently and are
troubled by numerous
changes. When the
structural steel is let on a
tonnage basis the contract
is often signed while the
drawings, both architectur-
al and structural, are in a
very incomplete form.
When such is the case the
structural engineer usually
has his troubles getting the
necessary information -from
the architectural and me-
chanical men, so that he
can finish his drawings,
working from the ground
up in such a way as to
keep ahead of the fabrica-
tors without delaying them.
As soon as the contract is let and the job becomes
active, the reinforcing steel and the structural steel
fabricators start preparing their shop drawings and

Staff Change
The February issue completes the volume of
magazines published by the 1930-1931 staff. The
new staff will publish the March issue. During the
past year the present staff was confronted with
many problems of an economic nature due to the
business depression. The wholehearted coopera-
tion of the student body and the faculty enabled
the retiring staff to conduct business on a sound
basis. It is the sincere desire of the incoming staff
to publish a magazine that will truly reflect the en-
gineering endeavors and accomplishments of Mich-
igan engineers. This can only be accomplished
through the combined efforts of both the staff
members and subscribers. Any aid in publishing
a bigger and better Technic during the next year
will be appreciated by the incoming staff.
Has Man Kept Pace with Himself
For the past year mankind has been in the throes
of a worldwide depression, a depression that has
caused want and suffering amid plenty. Reasons
galore have been given as the underlying causes for
this condition. Economists, industrialists, finan-
ciers, statesmen and the men of the street have all
given their reasons for the present economic up-
heaval. Some say it is due to over-production while
others say it is due to under-consumption; again
some say it is due to a declining silver market, while
still others say it is due to worldwide political un-
rest, and so on. True, most of the reasons given
have accentuated a worldwide unbalanced economic
condition, but are these not after all results instead
of the real cause?
This country, in the past, has gone through a
number of industrial and economic crises, but prac-
tically all of them have been localized instead of
worldwide and the causes therefore have been gen-
erally known. The present depression, unlike the
former ones, is worldwide in extent and occurs
amidst a wealth and bounty greater than the world
has ever before known. A depression or economic
upheaval occuring under such conditions cannot
possibly be the result of natural causes, but must
be the result of man-made conditions; in other
words, an unbalanced relationship between a man's
needs and his ability to acquire.
In the world of nature, overabundance never
causes need or want. So in the natural course of
human activity overabundance should not cause
need and want among mankind. The fact that it
does is evidence of a weakness somewhere in the
economic structure of mankind.
Modern civilization is the result of an era of in-
dustrial and mechanical development. Power and
machinery have taken the place of hand labor and
mass production in the order of the day. The
world's needs can now be produced in a fraction of
the time formerly required.
Under our system of mass production the cost of
producing the needs and luxuries of present day life
has decreased, yet their cost to the ultimate con-
sumer has increased materially. The reason for this
may be laid at the door of an economic system that
pyramids production cost through a chain of non-
producing agencies, operating between producer
and consumer.
Transportation is the keystone of our present eco-
nomic system. It is the life-blood of modern busi-
ness. Upon transportation the producer must de-
pend to bring his commodity to the consumer in or-
der for that commodity to become of value. The
mechanics of modern transportation has been de-
veloped to a high degree. It is no longer a physical
problem to transport commodities in quantity over


Page Fifteen
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
land and sea. Yet, with all our modern physical
transportation facilities we find economic depression
in one locality resulting from overproduction of
foodstuffs while in other localities mankind is suf-
fering for the want of it. Does this not force us to
the conclusion that there is a defect in the eco-
nomic system of our present day business relation-
ship that will permit of such a condition?
Linked with our present economic system is the
so called law of supply and demand. Economists
tell us that this law is an intangible governing
mechanism that speeds up or throttles clown busi-
ness depending on mankind's ability to produce and
consume. Xo thinking person would dispute that
supply and demand are factors in any economic set-
up. But is it not also true that the relationship
between supply and demand depends in turn on
ability to acquire? The supply may be ample, the
desire to consume may be equally great, yet the
ability to acquire may be lacking for economic rea-
sons. Modern civilization has created the ability
to supply, modern science has created the desire
and longing to acquire the things civilization can
or is able to supply, yet our present economic sys-
tem has permitted the setting up of conditions that
have affected the financial status of the layman to
the extent where it has been impossible for him to
acquire the things he wants and longs for.
Wealth results from converting the resources of
nature into things useful to mankind. The ex-
change of commodities from producer to consumer
does not change its true value, except that it must
reach the consumer to have value. However the
value of an article is, as a rule, not reflected in the
price of the article, for under our present economic
system the price is generally determined by all the
traffic will bear. The fact that laws have to be
enacted against restraint in trade is evidence of
that fact. Any economic system that permits price
inflation, far in excess of its true worth, is bound to
affect the purchasing power of millions in times of
economic stress.
Economically speaking, labor should balance de-
mand for production. If, due to modern machinery
and improved methods, the needs of mankind can
be produced in less time than heretofore, labor
hours should be shortened. Idle labor is an eco-
nomic liability that will soon upset the balance of
any economic structure.
Figuratively speaking modern science has annihi-
lated time and space. Communication, trade, and
commerce have brought together the nations of the
earth, and business intercourse between nations has
created a worldwide desire for the better things of
life. National isolation would today mean eco-
nomic suicide. Business intercourse between na-
tions has thrown open the markets of the world.
As a result an economic system has sprung up that
pulsates in the business heart of every nation, a
system that is sensitive to local influences the world
over. Any sudden economic stress in one country
reflects itself in the business structure of every
other nation.
Modern civilization has been instrumental in rais-
ing the plane of living of the average layman the
world over. Modern science has created a desire
and longing for the better things of life. Yet, with
all of our boasted advancement, the burden of liveli-
hood to the layman is greater today than in the
past. Should not the civilization that has created
the desire and longing for the better things of life
create an economic system that will satisfy that
desire?
What then does the present economic depression
signify? Science has developed a wonderful me-
chanical civilization, one that can supply the
world's needs with a minimum of labor. It has
developed a transportation system that has all the
physical requirements for proper worldwide distri-
bution. It has also created a worldwide desire for
the better things of life. It has established a world-
wide business intercourse which has linked together
the nations of the earth. To properly synchronize
this wonderful mechanical development with the
human relationship between mankind requires an
economic system that is flexible and responsive to
the world's needs. But what has mankind done in
this respect? Has it developed an economic system
that is responsive to present day needs? If it had
there would be no worldwide economic depression
today. On the contrary, man has failed to visualize
an economic structure responsive to present day
business needs. He has built up his present eco-
nomic system piecemeal and without regard to
changing economic conditions. In other words our
present economic system has grown up like a
Topsy. In the final analysis, then, does not the
present depression indicate that man has failed to
keep his economic status abreast of his mechanical
development? In other words, has man not failed
to keep pace with himself?
o
Prevention of Depression Said
More Essential Than Cure
The widely-advocated "spend-more" solution for
the present business depression is challenged by
Dexter S. Kimball, noted author and industrial en-
gineer, in a statement issued through the Graduate
School of Business of Stanford University, Califor-
nia. To suggest that consumers deliberately in-
crease their expenditures at a time when millions
of them are unemployed, according to Kimball, is
like telling a man to defend himself after he has
been knocked flat.
According to this authority, the present business

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
COLLEGE NOTES
Professor Albert D. Moore
One of these fellows to whom you can be intro-
duced as a perfect stranger and yet be tempted to
call him by nickname within five minutes, is Pro-
fessor A. D. Moore. He is perhaps the one man in
the engineering school with whom all the under-
graduates can claim at least a casual acquaintance,
and this may be blamed to his position as head
mentor and perennial guardian
of the frosh. He has sustained
this "burden" for the past four
years.
The Professor says that
one of his chief relaxations is
writing humorous papers to
read before clubs and various
general gatherings. We can
still remember how, as fresh-
men, we always felt a slight
tinge of regret when he ar-
ranged for an outside speaker
for the assembly periods. His
fabulous fund of anecdotes and
his ingratiating ability as a
speaker was a continual source
of delight. And it was quite a
relief to know that he wasn't
selling us something. We
could never have resisted.
Hmmm!
Professor Moore, to wax
biographical, was born in Fair-'
chance, Pa., on January 7,
1895, and in 1915 received his
B.S. degree from the Carnegie
Institute of Technology, Pittsburg. He then took
a graduate student training course with Westing-
house for a year's time, and began as an instructor
in the University of Michigan in 1916. Continuous
teaching in the regular and many summer sessions
has led to the rank of Associate Professor.
His activities, to put it mildly, are many and
varied. On campus the Professor, in collaboration
with Mrs. Moore, has written, directed, and pro-
PROF. A. I). MOORE
duced three or four of the Cosmopolitan Club's In-
ternational Nights, which are given yearly in Hill
Auditorium. He has also served as house manager
for the University Club for several years.
He is a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, social
fraternity, Tau Beta Pi, and Sigma XI, and in the
past few years the names of Tau Beta Pi and A. D.
Moore seem to be synonomous.
He was on the National Execu-
tive Council in 1924, and in
that year introduced a consti-
tutional change in the form of
the Council. For his efforts he
was promptly elected to the
presidency of the new Council
and held this office for two
three-year periods ending in
December, 1930. During these
six years Tau Beta Pi changed
from a losing game financially
to one in which the income is
sufficient to support six fellow-
ships. This aspect was intro-
duced two years ago. The fel-
lowships are of $750.00 each
and are granted to high-grade
engineer graduates to enable
them to take a year of ad-
vanced work for their Master's
degree, or to start on the doc-
torate. Professor Moore also
introduced other changes in the
society leading to invigoration,
and has been treasurer of the
Michigan Gamma chapter since about 1920.
But this was not enough. He helped to organize,
and is now vice-president of the Association of Col-
lege Honor Societies, whose membership now con-
sists of Phi Beta Kappa, Tau Beta Pi, Sigma Xi,
Phi Kappa Phi, Alpha Omega Alpha, Order of the
Coif, Sigma Tau, and Omicron Delta Kappa.
He has been interested in the Honor System, and
has written copiously on the subject. In 1927 he

conducted a survey of it through the medium of
Tau Beta Pi, but he is not, however, connected with
the Honor Committee in any more than an advisory
capacity. Professor Moore is also a member of the
American Institute of :—==^^_____^^___
Electrical Engineers, be-
fore which body he gave
a paper on heat radia-
tion in 1929. Earlier, in
1926, h e contributed
articles on magnetic
field plotting and the
theory of equalizer con-
nections to the Electric
Journal. In 1927 he pub-
lished a book, "Funda-
mentals of Electrical De-
sign", and in the sum-
mer of 1929 gave three
two-week periods of lec-
tures to groups of engi-
neers at Westinghouse,
Robbins and Myers Co.,
and Reliance Electric

magnetic and heat
topics.

claims that he prefers
five weeks of camping
with his family on an is-
land in Canada to any
other vacation yet dis-
covered, and that he
plays hearts and three
cushion billards as often
as opportunity permits.
Registered Engineers
In 1919 the State of
Michigan incorporated a
law requiring that all
plans for public works
of any kind exceeding a
capital investment of
over $2000 must be ex-
amined and signed by
an approved registered
engineer or architect.
The act, known as the
"Registration Act", fur-
ther required that all
architects and engineers
practicing within the
state at that time be registered upon adequate
recommendation, and that before any other archi-
tect or engineer would be eligible for registration he
must successfully pass an examination which was

wrath of an enraged engineer.

Now for the expansion!
Erv came here as a freshman in 19.27 and immediate-
ly acquired an idea, a rare start for a freshman. He
worked out this idea and rose above the ranks as the
first successful organizer of intra-class athletics in the
engineering school. Several teams were organized by
him and, as a result of his efforts and the cooperation
of his classmates, the freshmen won the basketball cham-
pionship of the engineering school that year. Athletics
were quite the dominant outside interest during this time,
but Erv broke away long enough to serve on the Frosh
Frolic committee. He was also initiated into Delta Alpha
Epsilon, social fraternity.
The sophomore year's activities were devoted to the
regular routine and to the duties of class president. The
duties were deftly performed and during the next year he
was elected to Triangles, Junior Honorary Fraternity.
He then became one of the committeemen of the original
Slide Rule Dance, which was remarkably successful.
His senior year has been and will continue to be a
busy one. Besides his regular school work, he is acting
as student assistant to Professor Mickle, of the mechan-
ical department. During his spare time he does draft-
ing for an Ann Arbor engineering firm. He has been
intermittently engaged in this work for the past three
years and by this means has helped to pay his way
through school. Honors again came to our friend when
he was recently elected to Vulcans, senior society and was
made president of the organization. The coming Slide
Rule Dance again finds his services useful.
Despite all of his outside activities, Erv has maintained
a nice scholastic record and he hasn't lost sight of his
purpose in being here at the University. He even finds
time to make a few flying trips to Mosher-Jordan; a
delightful diversion for any engineer. "Who is Sylvia,
what is she, that all our swains commend her"?
The impression that we get is that here is a man who
lias been endowed with a goodly supply of cerebral mat-
ter, or else he has an overflowing abundance of produc-
tive energy. Perhaps we'll make a compromise on the
two factors.
to be drawn up by a Board of State Examiners; or
else "show ample evidence of capacity".
As the law now stands it is not necessary for all
engineers or architects to be registered, but it is
_ highly desirable for the
practicing engineer inas-
much as many cities now
grant building permits
only when the plans and
specifications have been
prepared by a registered
engineer. Registration
acts are in effect in
about twenty-five of the
states and most of the
acts include a transfer
clause which allows a
registered engineer to
practice in any other
state without a re-ex-
amination.
Michigan requires that
an applicant must have
had at least two years of
practical experience be-
fore a certificate of reg-
istration is granted.
This, however, does not
prevent senior students
from taking the exami-
nation immediately -aft-
er graduation. These
students may undertake
all of the examination
except those portions
pertaining to profession-
al experience, then, after
two years of practice,
may come back and fin-
ish the examination.
This scheme is very
advantageous to the
graduating engineer as
he probably will never
be so well prepared in
the fundamentals o f
mathematics, physics,
hydraulics, etc., as he is
at that time.
The examinations are
held two times a year;
usually during the last
three days of December

They are given in Ann Arbor, Lansing, and upon
request, in the Upper Peninsula.

Patrick 4 I if ford Graney
Famous names the world over, in some way find
a niche in Who's Who. A book of this nature large
enough to really contain the names of all the great
would be inconceivably large, and unfit for com-
mercial use. Yet the fact remains that there are,
today, thousands of names eligible for the Hall of
Fame; but names that remain whispers, due to
modesty on the part of the owner, or an un-
conscious dread of unwanted publicity. Despite
these difficulties, every so often a name springs to
light that causes us to reflect upon the significance
of that name.
Who's Who is not wanting in its proportion of
famous men who are graduates of the University.
Who's Who of Engineering is rich in its list of Mich-
igan men that have really done things since leaving
Ann Arbor. We find men from every line of engi-
neering whose names have become prominent
through their works. More names are added every
day, to the further glory of the college where those
names were first registered as freshmen embryo en-
gineers. One of the future names for Who's Who
is that of an engineer who graduated with the class
of 1917, obtaining a degree of B.S. in Civil Engi-
neering. That name is Patrick Clifford Graney.
Among the foremost coal operators of the coun-
try, and especially in the New River-Wining Gulf
coal fields of West Virginia, Mr. Graney is well
known, not only for his personality, but because he
is also General Manager of the C. C. B. Smokeless
Coal Company.
Mr. Graney was born on the twenty-ninth clay
of July, in 1891, one of the three children born to
Michael and Susan Bircher Graney. The Graney
children received their primary schooling at the
place of birth, Flemington, West Virginia, and the
high school subjects were received first at Thacker
Mines, West Virginia, and later at Williamson and
Mount Hope. He came to Michigan in 1912, and
graduated in 1917, with a Civil Engineering degree,
after having been out during the year of 1915-16,
during which period he worked as transitman for
the McKell Coal and Coke Company, receiving
much good and practical experience.
Michael Graney had long been interested in min-
ing, and it must have been with pride that he
watched his son follow in his footsteps upon the
path toward a mining career, for when Mr. Graney
was but twelve years of age, he began his first job
of picking slate for the Pitts Vein Coal Company, at
Flemington, West Virginia. During three of his
summer vacation periods before entering the Uni-
versity, he was employed in sorting coal, and in
machine shops, and all during the vacation periods
of high school, and college, he was employed in and
around the mines.
In 1910, when he accepted a position under P. M.
Snyder, with the Snyder Lumber Company, he be-
gan a valuable business association that has contin-
ued ever since. In 1911-1912 he helped appreciably
in the opening of the Long Branch Coal Company.
For a few months after graduation, he served as
division engineer for the New River and Pocahon-
tas Consolidated Coal Company. Late in 1917 he
accepted the position of Chief Engineer for the
Snyder interests, including the Long Branch Coal
Company, East Gulf Coal Company, The Prince-
wick Coal Company, Glencoe Coal Company, and
the Pemberton Fuel Company.
Mr. Graney gave up his work in 1918, to answer
the call of his country, and enlisted in the Engi-
neer's Corps. His experience and training earned
him recognition, and at the end of the war, he was
well through the training course that would have
fitted him for an officer.
Following the Armistice, Mr. Graney worked as
Assistant Engineer for the New River Company,
changing in 1920 to the Smith-Pond Creek Coal
Company, just opened by the X. and W. Railway
field. He served as Vice-President and General
Manager of this company until 1922, when he once
more centered his work in the Snyder interests, in
charge of engineering and preparation of the coal.
In 1925, he became Assistant to the President, P. M.
Snyder. When these mines were transferred to the
Massachusetts Gas Company, in January, 1926,
along with the E. E. White Coal Company, at
Glenwhite and Strotesbury, West Virginia, Mr.
Graney remained as Assistant to Mr. Snyder, who

became Vice-Presiclent in charge of operations.
In 1927, Mr. Graney became General Manager of
the merger of the E. E. White Coal Company, the
East Gulf Coal Company, the Princewick Coal Com-
pany, The Pemberton Fuel Company, Glencoe Coal
Company, and the Long Branch Coal Company; a
merger designated as the C. C. B. Smokeless Coal
Company, with Mr. Snyder at its head. Mr. Graney
also became a director and Vice-President of the
Sterling Smokeless Coal Company, operating in
Winding Gulf District.
Mr. Graney was married at Mount Hope, West
Virginia, in 1920, to Miss Thelma Snyder, a daugh-
ter of P. M. Snyder. Two children have come of
this union. Patrick Clifford, Junior, aged four, and
Nancy, who is still looking toward a second birth-
day.
Mr. Graney finds diversion in the golf game
played with more than one club, upon greens and
courses other than the familiar Pee-Wee. He is
an enthusiastic member of the White Oak Coun-
try Club, and the Black Knight Country Club. He
finds time for civic duties as a member of the City
Council of Mount Hope, West Virginia, and on
Sunday mornings when Golf permits, is seen in the
local Baptist Church.
Graduates with a record and reputation like Mr.
Graney's are Uncommon, and we are only too glad
to take this opportunity to present our readers, a
biography of a Michigan engineer who has made
good in his chosen field. Michigan is proud, and
justly so, of one of her sons who has bourne her
standard through fourteen years of life since leas'-

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW
AND ENGINEERING
(Continued from page 9)
must be evident that the professional lawyer might
profitably have a good training in engineering as a
background.
The Consulting Engineer
The second classification concerns the consulting
engineering whose activities are in corporation
work, arbitration, and litigation. He is called upon
to analyze certain situations and develop the facts.
The very nature of his work throws him in con-
tact with outstanding lawyers. A thorough under-
standing of the law makes him materially more
valuable to his client, as he is able to more critically
survey the facts of the situation. He has a better
conception of the mission of the case, and he is able
to array his facts most favorably to his position. In
particular, he is better equipped to analyze his op-
ponent's position and point out the weaknesses.
The engineer in this field of work will find a de-
mand for his services in the valuation field where
large utilities are purchased and sold, where rates
are determined on "cost of reproduction basis", or
where receivership raises the relative rights of
stockholders, bondholders, and creditors. A thor-
ough understanding of the legal rights and liabili-
ties of the parties is essential to the great utiliza-
tion of the engineer's resources. It should be em-
phasized that the engineer does not act as a legal
counsel at any time, but rather that his legal train-
ing enables him to better coordinate his efforts
with the work of the lawyer.
The Professional Engineer
The third classification includes that group of en-
gineers who have had a few years of experience and
are getting beyond the inspector and draftsman
class of activity. Their work involves an increas-
ingly large number of contacts with the public, the
client, and the contractors. As time goes on, his
duties are more executive and administrative, and
he becomes a substantial figure in the business
world. A statistical analysis of the activities of the
engineering graduates of the University of Michi-
gan shows a strikingly large number holding posi-
tions of high responsibility. Our attention may
now be directed to this third classification to de-
termine what type of legal training, if any, would
be desirable for them.
It does not seem necessary that the professional
engineer have a thorough training in the law. lie
will not be called upon to sit in conference on legal
matters. His efforts lean more toward the business
than the legal side of life. As an executive he is
called upon to manage industries; to promote and
develop large projects; to market machinery and
manufactured products. A few of our more suc-
cessful engineers have even become heads of finan-
cial institutions and politicians of the highest grade.
This group of engineers should have a general train-
ing in the law, as contrasted with the highly tech-
nical education of the lawyer himself. This gen-
eral training in the law should not be designed to
supplant the services of a lawyer, but to facilitate
the use of the engineer's resources to the most
profitable advantage. It is a method of averting
difficulties, rather than curing them after they de-
velop. This training should be general in the sense
that it covers the field of law interesting to an en-
gineer, but without the finely spun niceties neces-
sary to the professional lawyer. The generalities
should not be so broad that the training is shallow.
On the contrary, it should be sufficiently specific
that the broad rules will be clearly set forth with
the proper fundamental reasons and applications
thereof.
This training should be specially designed to meet
the executive duties of the engineer. He is vitally
interested in property rights, mortgages, and the se-
curing of title by easement and rights of eminent
domain. A few are interested in mining and irri-
gation law. Most engineers are interested in the
business relationships of agency, partnerships, pub-
lic and private corporations, and their legal limits
of powers. The floating of municipal bonds will
necessitate an understanding of the nature of the
municipal corporation. The training should cer-
tainly include work on patent law for he may meet
a number of problems in this field. The legal im-
portance of negotiable instruments will be of par-
ticular importance in business relationships. And
finally, the engineer might well understand the
rules of evidence governing "expert testimony".
From the foregoing cursory analysis of this sub-
ject, it would appear that there is quite a close re-
lationship between certain branches of the law and
of engineering. The general counsel for a large
negotiation or litigation may suddenly find himself
face to face with genuine engineering problems.
While he should at once turn to expert engineers for
advice, still his own engineering background should
be of real value in the development of his case. The
counterpart lies in the consulting engineer. He
should know the basic legal principles involved in
order that he may better prepare his engineering
data. This legal training should be designed to
meet his individual requirements as an engineer, but
with no effort to supplant the services of the pro-
fessional lawyer.
Between these two classes lies the group of pro-
fessional engineers who have gradually developed
into the executive field. Their administrative duties
require that they should have a general training in
the law in order that they may better solve every
day problems.
While the above classifications include neither all
of the attorneys-at-law. nor all of the engineers, still

guardian angel for the following three months. To
this man he will bring all his troubles; why he con-
sistently lands too high, why he loses altitude in his
ADMIRAL'S SATURDAY INSPECTION
flipper turns, why he cannot keep his heading in a
loop, and why he cannot beach his plane properly,
will be his major problems and questions. To the
inexhaustable supply of questions the instructor
must know the answers. The instructor of today
is a student of human nature for he must know how
to approach each different type of student, what
student to bawl out and to which one he must talk
quietly. In less than twenty hours of solo, this
embryonic aviator is forced to learn stunts, which
he does by going up with his guardian angel who
first performs a maneuver and after a detailed ex-
planation turns the ship over to said student for his
first attempt at placing the plane in an unusual po-
sition. And in most cases it turns out to be more
of an unusual position than was expected.
Before four months have elapsed our future pilot
has acquired about 70 hours in the air and should
by this time be able to take care of himself in most
any emergency. He must now prove this to the
squadron commander by taking him out for a ride
in which he will include all that he knows in the
way of stunts, precision landings, side slips, and
last, but far from least, every landing must be
perfect. If the check pilot decides that he shows
the promise of becoming a good flyer adaptable to
the Navy's needs, he is sent to Squadron Two for
training in landplanes.
He is now ready for a new G.A., who will answer
his queries for the succeeding three or four months.
It is quite surprising to find that the student is
rather baffled by his new surroundings and is often
slow to pick up the differences in the handling of
the landplane as compared to the seaplane. How-
ever in a reasonable time the student is soloing
again but not with the same confidence with which
he left the beach. For the first five hours he does
nothing but circle the quarter section field and
make landings, under the eagle eye of the executive
officer. This alone would not be bad but the pres-
ence of as many as 20 other green students doing
the same thing adds much to the worry of our hero.
This completed, he then passes to the perfecting of
precision landings along with approaches and land-
ings in small fields of the postage stamp variety.
Veterans Field is so small that only one plane can
be landed in it at a time and even then it must be
brought in between high trees, so our student is
constantly alert if he expects to get down safely.
At the completion of precision landings the
syllabus again calls for stunts followed by forma-
tion work and cross country hops. One learns to
tell the good emergency fields from the bad by their
coloring and shading, and how to check one's route
by railroads, highways, rivers, etc. With the pass-
ing of the final check at Squadron 2 the world is
lifted from the student's shoulders, and after a fit-
ting celebration he passes to the Observation Squad-

Modern Production Equipment
for Modern Milling—
THE present day production engineer realizes
the losses that result from the use of obsolete
methods and equipment, consequently.you will find
him continuously recommending the purchase of
modern up-to-the-minute production units.
For milling operations'—'the production of ac-
curate duplicate parts in quantities'—'the Brown &amp;
Sharpe No. 21 Automatic Milling Machine offers
some remarkable production possibilities. Fully
automatic in operation, this machine, in the field of
work for which it is adapted, will generally replace
at least two ordinary milling machines.
It pays to always be familiar with the
latest developments in Brown&amp;Sharpe
Machine Tools, a complete catalog
of which will be sent upon request.

OFFICE BUILDING PLANNING
(Continued from page 12)
zoned building, the typical plan, applying to the
portion from the lower story to the first set-back,
is generally the most important because it repre-
sents the largest proportion of the area and income.
Consideration, however, must be given to each of
the set-back groups of floors as well, so that serv-
ice elements properly disposed in the lower stories
may remain properly disposed in the upper stories,
where not only do the outer walls recede from the
street, and draw in on the service units, but the
service core itself shrinks. Under the New York
zoning law, when the gross area of the plan shrinks
through set-backs to an area equal to one-quarter
:&gt;f the lot, the building may then be carried to an
indefinite height, so far as the law is concerned,
without further set-back, providing certain re-
strictions concerning the tower location on the lot
r.re fulfilled. The core of service satisfactorily lo-
cated for the lower stories must also be satisfac-
torily located for these tower floors if there are any.
The architectural planner must know how to com-
promise the conflicting demands of the various
.loors, this knowledge coming from a study of the
facts in the particular case.
With the unzoned lot, the plan may remain es-
sentially the same from bottom to top, making only
such modifications as desired because of the shrink-
ing core, and mass considerations. No note has
been made of first and second story considerations
in the plan, because it is understood that while there
may be large and important tenants, such as banks
mid the like, whose needs will definitely force cer-
tain features in the plan, these apply to zoned and
unzoned buildings alike. With the tendency to in-
creasing height of tower buildings, such as the
Chrysler, the Empire State, etc., the tower plan is
becoming more important. There is also a per-
ceptible tendency toward reducing the allowable
area of the lower floors, building only quality space
around the essential service core, and then carry-
ing the building to a sufficient height to provide
space to develop the project. Aside from legal, en-
gineering and rental considerations, the height of
a building is also limited through the law of di-
minishing returns as applied to return on the in-
vestment.*
The building size is largely determined by gen-
eral economic and zoning factors, the character and
quality largely by what is conceived to be the
neighborhood need or trend. Loose formulae have
been developed attempting to show what gross area
and cubic contents should be constructed to de-
velop a lot of given value, but probably the most
simple and satisfactory method is that of trial and
error in which set-ups for various size buildings

are considered. With zoned lots, the entire area
permitted by la\v for the typical and set-back stories
is generally computed to the permissible tower
base. If the tower floors are reasonable in gross
area, computations of total area and cubic contents
are made for various assumed tower heights. Just
what is "reasonable" is questionable. Towers be-
low five thousand feet in area are generally ques-
tionable, but in the case of the Continental Build-
ing, on a small, costly New York City lot, con-
sidered below, a tower of 3400 square feet gross area
was constructed.
Story heights run about ll'-6" floor to floor,
though for large areas or in warm climates they
sometimes run more. In towers and in shallow
space, these heights are sometimes cut to 11'-0".
Lower stories, suitable for street display, may
sometimes run a little higher than average, and
often there is a high bank story.
With story heights assumed, a section showing
set-backs is drawn, from which the zoning plan for
the lot is drawn. This consists of a line diagram,
showing the various floors superimposed on each
other, for the Continental Building. The number
of stories in each set-back is optional as long as
they are inside the zoning envelope, and may be
assumed in preliminary computations, or may be
determined by simultaneous elevation study. Al-
lowance for light courts may be made if conditions
warrant.
From the zoning plan, gross areas are tentative-
ly computed, from which the net may be approxi-
mated. From the tentative net area a tentative
total occupancy may be computed and with the as-
sumed building height the total number and ar-
rangement of elevators may be approximated, on
such basis that they are not only ample in number
to carry the peak traffic but also to travel at satis-
factory time intervals. The toilet rooms and serv-
ice units are roughly determined on the basis of the
computed population. The stairways should be as
remote from each other as reasonably possible, and
adequate in dimensions and number for the cal-
culated occupancy, but are usually established by
building code regulations.
The elevators, stairs, general service units, and
miscellaneous items such as pipe and vent shafts.
smoke flue, etc., being roughly determined, arc
grouped into an efficient, compact and centralized
service core. The shape of the cores depends upon
the shape of the lot, and the general location and
amount of dark space in the various floors. In block
developments the core is obviously placed in the
centre; in block front developments, usually against
the closed lot line; in corner developments general-
ly against one of the dark sides or in the inside
corner, though special conditions may cause a varia-
tion in any of these cases.

pick-up was brought about by a single operator!
On each boiler control panel near the push button controls
were his operating guides—Bailey Boiler Meters and Multi-
Pointer Gages. They told him when to send his electrical
orders over copper nerves to huge fans, to whirring coal
feeders, and to rumbling pulverizers. Most important of all,
they enabled him to maintain efficient combustion during
the entire change from light load to full load.

Alpha Tau Sigma
Six students and one faculty member were
initiated last month into Alpha Tau Sigma, national
honorary journalistic fraternity at a banquet held
at the Michigan Union.
J. Raleigh Nelson, professor of English and pro-
lific contributor to the Michigan Technic, was
made an honorary member and the following men
were made student members; Bazley Williams
Johnson, 32E, John E. Ohlson, 32A, Emil T. Neu-
bauer, 31E, Will F. Ross, 31E, Duncan J. Seaton,
32A, and Ray G. Schmidt, 3IE.
The greeting and welcome to the new members
was extended by Lea Verne Ansel and the response
was made by Bazley Williams Johnson. Professor
Brackett, sponsor of the engineering debaters and
honorary member of Alpha Tau Sigma, lent his
professional declamatory experience by keeping a
rigid lookout for breaches of procedure in Professor
Nelson's talk on engineering journalism.
The Engineering Smoker
Amid the odor of tobacco and the sound of
drums and saxaphones, more than 750 students
and faculty members gathered at the Union, Thurs-
day evening, January 15, for the annual all-engi-
neering smoker sponsored by the Engineering Coun-
cil. An address by J. M. Fitzgerald, an executive
of the Eastern Railroads Conference, featured the
evening.
Preceding the speaker on the evening's program
was Will Ross, master of ceremonies, Tommy
Roberts, a tap dancer, the Midnight Sons quartet,
and an orchestra.
Speaking on "Transportation", a subject eternal-
ly vital to the engineer, Fitzgerald traced the de-
velopment of railroads in the United States from
the days before the Interstate Commerce Act
to the present time, and compared with it the rise
of waterways, motor transportation, and aviation.
If the transportation to be accomplished in the
country was apportioned to these various branches
in such a way that each one did the type of work to
which it was best adapted, there would result a
much better general transportation system. He
laid especial emphasis on the great strides made by
the American railroads in the past ten years. "En-
gineers have made of the American railroads the
fastest and most dependable service known to the
world." We need only to examine the Russian sys-
tem to appreciate this statement.
The American government, Fitzgerald believes,
is entirely too apathetic to the railways. While it
spends millions of dollars for aiding motor and aero-
nautical transportation, its greatest interest in rail-
roads, it appears, is to see that they don't make too
much money. The speaker concluded, "If we in-
sist upon eating caviar daily, we must consider the
sturgeon".
This smoker was one of the external manifesta-
tions that there really is an active organization
called the Engineering Council, and even if this
were their only accomplishment, the smoker justifies
their existence.

ing."

locations from 16 to 20 feet, in depth from 20 to 30
feet. In New York City, 19 to 20 foot bays, with
two windows, and maximum depth of 28 to 30 feet
is considered good office space. This provides for
subdivision of each bay into two outside private
offices, and an inside general office. The circulat-
ing corridor varies from 5 to 6 feet in width. The
plan is completely determined by the multiplication
of the typical office bay, with its own section of cir-
culating corridor around the service core. In the
case of corner lots, and relatively shallow block
front lots, there is generally a single row of offices
in front of the service unit, as in the Continental
Building. If the lot is large, the typical unit is
formed by repeating the typical office on each side
of a standard corridor, as shown at the east end
of the Continental plan, and the general plan is
formed by the multiplication of this unit into wings,
projecting from a central mass containing the core,
somewhat as in typical Burnham, H and U plans,
and as exemplified in the huge General Motors
Office Building in Detroit.
The Continental Building, at the southeast corner
of Broadway and 41st Street, New York City, as a
specific example, illustrates many of the above
general principles. Light is available on the west

and north, the street sides, while the south and east
lot line sides are blanked by a large structure to a
height of 27 stories, except for an interior court in
this latter building adjoining the Continental lot at
the southeast corner. It was logical in locating the
service unit to place it against the south wall, being
dark, clearing the adjoining building court and far
enough back from the street for satisfactory office
depth, with a little to spare to provide for offsets.
An interior court was provided at the southeast
corner of the lot, which combined with the court in
the adjoining building to make an exceptionally
large court for both buildings. The space from the
street back to the court at the east end is fairly
large in the lower stories, but allowance was made
for the shrinkage in depth due to the increasing size
of the legal rear court, as the building ascended,
and the early offset required at that end of the lot.
The tower was an economic necessity but, being
only 3400 square feet in area, it was considered that
four elevators were the maximum number that
could be used and still leave satisfactory space. The
maximum distance which four high speed signal
control elevators could travel with a satisfactory
time interval of approximately 30 seconds was 40
stories, which was accordingly taken as the build-
ing height. Incidentally, only two of these eleva-
tors would be required, based on occupancy. As
fire tower stairs must connect with a court, the
stairs, elevators, and toilets were logically ar-
ranged, providing ideal tower floors for single or
multiple occupancy. Six local elevators were neces-
sary for the lower section of the building, and ac-
cordingly two banks were provided as indicated.
Toilet rooms in the lower stories were placed in
the blanked alcove of the express elevators, and
these service units were built out to the line of the
local elevators, providing a deeper, service core in
the deeper lower story space. The local elevators
and general stairs were placed nearer the street
front because, as offsets cut in on the office depth,
these units were dropped out, again leaving a sat-
isfactory depth in the upper stories and in the
tower. The large vent shaft and many service
lines, essential to the lower section of the building,
were carried to the pipe story at the lower base, and
services, which could not be omitted, were carried
to the top of the tower in shafts at the dead ends
of the alcoves. It so happened that the tower floors
figured exactly 2500 square feet each, and as New
York laws requires only one stairway for such an
area, the first tower stairs only was carried up.
The gross area developed for this forty-story
building is 353,300 square feet. If there was no
zoning law, and the typical floor was carried up full
to the top, this same gross area would have been

developed in about 26 stories, with a maximum of
8 elevators. Or. if it had been carried 40 stories
without zoning set-backs, there would have been
developed somewhat over 520,000 square feet gross
area, with at least 14 passenger elevators, which
could easily be provided where no set-backs would
interfere with their proper disposition.
The time has been reached in office building de-
velopment when an improvement in elevator
technique, even though it is now remarkable, will
have to be accomplished. A huge new office build-
ing is now being constructed in New York City with
double deck elevators, and two loading levels. Con-
sideration is also being given to the use of the shaft
by at least two cars, giving local and express serv-
ice respectively. Stairways, moreover, are inade-
quate and practically useless as the building exit
from the upper floors in high buildings, because it
is physically impossible, as tests have shown, for
any except the most physically fit to walk down all
the way from the top of such buildings without col-
lapse. Consideration has even been given to inter-
mediate isolated emergency floors. These items
are part of the problem of tomorrow.

STRUCTURAL DEVELOPMENT OF OFFICE
(Continued from page 13)
sending them to the architects' or engineers' office
for approval. If there are discrepancies, errors, or
a lack of information on the structural drawings, the
engineer will begin to hear about it at this time.
Also about this time any unexpected soil conditions
will be uncovered and if any change or adjustments
are required in the foundation, they must be made
at once.
When the foundations are complete and the
structural frame, whether of concrete or steel, be-
gins to rise, the structural engineer will still get
numerous calls from the field for information, the
number depending in part on how complete and cor-
rect the drawings are, and in part on how exper-
ienced the contractor and the superintendent are. It
usually happens that when there is any real trouble
or difficulty at the job, the contractor and superin-
tendent bring it into the office for solution. Even
after the structural frame is complete in the field,
questions will arise from time to time because of in-
terferences with mechanical or architectural work.
In this connection the structural engineer usually
has the advantage because his work is already in
place.
MARCHING
with modern industry to World-Power
In the great new power plant that serves the city
of Buenos Aires, Crane valves and fittings are
found in use. In the paper mills of Ontario and
the water power developments of Niagara Falls,
engineers swear by them. Camels carry them in-
to the depths of the Abyssinian Desert and dog
sledges into the wilds of Canada.
The quality of Crane piping materials has won them
a world-wide demand. The globe-girdling Crane dis-
tributing organization has placed them within easy
reach of power and industrial builders everywhere.
Naturally, this distributing organization is most
complete and efficient in the United States. In
this country are factories in five cities manufac-
turing industrial piping materials; branches and
sales offices in 160 cities; warehouses in close
proximity to every important industrial center.
All these facilities are keyed to receive orders for
quickly needed materials and have them on the
spot with no loss of time.
No matter where you take up your career after you
leave school, you will find need for piping mate-
rials from the complete Crane line, and a Crane
office nearby to make it easy for you to get them.

slump is remarkable for the absence of that gen-
eral attitude of hopeless resignation which has
characterized depression periods in the past. A
flood of suggested cures for industrial depression
has appeared, ranging all the way from every con-
ceivable type of governmental aid to miscellaneous
private and personal efforts. The majority of these
suggestions, however, have been merely of a pallia-
tive nature, instead of being designed to prevent the
recurrence of such economic disasters in the fu-
ture. These temporary measures, such as out-
right charity relief, the reduction of working hours,
the maintenance of working forces and of wage
levels, and the use of private and public moneys
for carrying on building construction and similar
projects, deserve serious consideration as common-
sense methods of supplying employment until in-
dustry again becomes active. Yet a serious diffi-
culty, as far as the use of state and federal funds is
concerned, lies in the amount of "red tape" that
must apparently be gone through before such funds
can be made available.
The real problem for the future, Kimball be-
lieves, is not the cure but the prevention of business
depression. The principal contribution of the al-

ready voluminous literature on the subject of busi-
ness fluctuations has been to identify the prob-
lem as one of distribution. A constant threat of
potential overproduction is a condition which is be-
coming increasingly evident in many lines of busi-
ness. The production of goods, as a result of years
of scientific study of production problems by pro-
fessionally trained men, is now on a sound and well-
ordered basis. But this same perfection of the
processes of making goods has shown in strong re-
lief the present imperfections of the processes of
distributing them. It is not too much to hope that
a more scientific spirit in distribution, fostered by
professional training in business, will come to su-
persede our present empiricism and guess-work
methods, and eventually lead us out of the existing
middle of the distribution problem.
Kimball, who is the author of several works on in-
dustrial engineering and organization, is Dean of
the Schools of Engineering of Cornell University,
and for the past few months has been a visiting pro-
fessor on the faculty of the Graduate School of Busi-
ness at Stanford University.

to combat work, in high powered single-seater
fighters. Way in the back of his head he has hoped
that some day it would be his privilege to fly one
of these cocky looking little planes—then his first
take off. Afterward we learn that he was too busy
getting this flying streak into the air and keeping
out of others way that he entirely lost all of the
thrill that he had waited years to experience.
One more squadron has to be taken into consid-
eration before he is entitled to wear Navy Wings.
Here he flies still another type of plane. It is the
large twin float seaplane which is used to carry tor-
pedoes or heavy bombs. After a short time in these
ships he tops off the course with catapult work and
blind flying. He must become accustomed to being
accelerated from a standstill to 65 m.p.h. in the 36
foot length of the catapult and still have com-
plete control of the plane.
All the flight work is accompanied by ground
school which one attends while he is not in the air.
Work on motors, plants, studying airology, and
navigation help him to become a better flyer while
gunnery, bombing, radio, scouting and other sub-
jects fits him for an active part in Uncle Sam's Bat-
tle Fleet.
Training methods have changed with the indus-
try. Compare the haphazard work of 1915 when as
little as two to ten hours of solo were required be-
fore one was made an instructor and now most
Navy instructors have nearly a thousand hours be-
fore they report to Pensacola. Compare the old
Wright biplane to the modern Corsairs or Hawks.

hack to the old training methods, the Navy would
be at the mercy of even the smallest of the world
powers.
A kindly old gentleman, seeing a man leaning
limply against the doorway of an apartment house
in the early hours, offered to help him up stairs if
he lived there, which offer was accepted. With
much difficult he dragged him up stairs and not
wishing to face perhaps an irate wife, he opened the
first door he came to and pushed him in. On reach-
ing the street, he made out the outline of another
drooping figure, apparently in worse condition than
the first one, so he offered to help him upstairs,
which offer was also quickly accepted, and the
loopy legged one was assisted to the same room as
his predecessor. Reaching the street once more,
the kindly gentleman was surprised to find a third
reveler, but nevertheless, he again approached and
proffered aid, whereat the object of his solicitude
ran into the arms of a passing policeman.
"For heaven's sake off'cer," he gasped, "protect
me from that man. He's done nothin' all night but
carry me up stairs 'n' throw me down th' elevator
shaf'."
A certain engineering Prof, had requested his stu-
dents to be less formal in writing their Blue Books.
In the next batch of Blue Books one especially rot-
ten one ended with this appendage: "Well, Al, here
it is. By the way, how are the wife and kiddies?" o
"I'd like a couple of hard boiled eggs to take out,"
said the student to the girl at the lunch counter.
"O. K. , kid," came back the skoit, dimpling,
"Mame and I'll be off in ten minutes." o
A new salesman was sent to Lyons, Kansas, and
on arrival there found the only hotel filled to the
roof.
"No, sir," said the clerk, "we can't let you have a
room unless you take half of a private dining room.
There's a screen across it and a young lady has the
other half of the room, but I guess she won't bother
you."
The salesman agreed it would do in a pinch.
A half hour later he dashed out into the corridor,
wide eyed and pale.
"Hey," he yelled to the clerk, "that woman is
dead."'
"I know it," said the clerk, "but how did you find
it out."

DIPHENYL—A NEW HEATING MEDIUM

the film of liquid diphenyl lias a higher thermal re-
sistance than a film of water. Diphenyl film co-
efficients determined in this laboratory range from
250 to 350 B.t.u. per square foot, per hour, per de-
degree Fahrenheit.
A second advantage of diphenyl heat comes in
the matter of temperature control. Diphenyl is
used as a saturated vapor. Consequently, the pres-
sure of this vapor fixes its temperature, and to con-

trol the temperature of the heating medium it is
only necessary to manipulate a throttle valve. It is
perfectly easy to maintain the temperature of the
diphenyl vapor in the apparatus constant to within
5aF. All the heat is put into the apparatus at this
one temperature. Once the apparatus is designed
and the working temperature drop fixed, no part of
the apparatus will have any material in it at a tem-
perature higher than this. On the other hand, when
superheated steam or flue gases are used they give
up their heat as sensible heat and therefore vary
in temperature. Their rates of heat transfer are
very low, and consequently a much higher average
working temperature drop must be provided if the
apparatus is to be kept within reasonable bounds as
to size. This not only means that the average tem-
perature of the heating medium is higher than

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
needed in the case of diphenyl, but the inlet tem-
perature of the heating medium must be very much
above its average temperature. In most of the
processes where diphenyl will be used the material
that will be heated or processed is such that it can
be decomposed or injured by local exposure to ex-
cessive temperatures. This is always possible when
using direct fire or flue gases, and may be the case
when using superheated steam. In addition to this,
it is practically impossible to control either the in-
let or the average temperature of either superheated
steam or Hue gases with anything like the precision
with which the diphenyl temperature may be con-
trolled.
The use of hot oil is limited because of the fact
that no oil is known that will be stable at tempera-
tures above 550°. Even at these temperatures there
is some decomposition with a consequent deposi-
tion of coke or tar on the heating surfaces. The
rate of heat transfer is usually not over 10 to 20
B.t.u. and the power required for circulating the oil
is considerable.
It is obvious then that the field of usefulness of
diphenyl is in carrying out operations where a heat-
ing medium ranging in temperature from 500 to
850 F. is desirable. Its advantages over all other
types of heating in this range are apparently com-
plete stability without deposition of tar or coke, ex-

How DYNAMITE was used in
the construction of the world's
tallest building
ANEW giant skyscraper now looks down on
New York's magnificent skyline. It is the
Empire State Building . . . and its topmost peak
towers 1248 feet above the earth!
It is the newest engineering marvel. Architects,
engineers, steel workers, riveters shared in its
making. But one mighty ally . . . DYNAMITE
. . . was first on the scene to do its powerful bit.
Working efficiently, quickly, Dynamite blasted
out solid rock so that the great foundation, 75 feet
below the earth, might be placed. Thirteen thousand
pounds of du Pont Dynamite was used on the job.
Skyscrapers ... tunnels . . . bridges . . . highways
. . . dams . . . reservoirs . . . these and numerous
other engineering wonders are made possible
through the aid of Dynamite.
If you would like to learn more about explosives
and how to use them ... if you want to learn
today for tomorrow's jobs . . . simply write direct
to the du Pont Company for full information.
You will receive a copy of The Blasters' Handbook,
which contains a great deal of the vast knowledge
of the explosives gained by the du Pont Company
in 129 years of making and testing explosives.

OXWELDING was selected as the means of installing the
piping system of the James Ward Packard Laboratory
because of its many advantages over other methods of pipe join-
ing. It lowered costs in every step of the installation. Design was
simplified. Fittings were fabricated from standard pipe section.
Weight was reduced. Insulation was facilitated and less time
was required to complete the job. The piping system in this
building is permanent. Every joint is as strong, as tight, as leak-
proof and as lasting as the pipe wall itself.
The oxy-acetylene process of welding and cutting metals has
many other interesting applications in the de-
sign, construction or fabrication of metal parts
or structures. Tomorrow's engineers will be ex-
pected to know how to apply this modern
metal - working process. Several valuable and

TIMKEN is
a Basic Principle of
Modern
Machine Design
The use of Timken Tapered Roller Bearings is a basic
principle in the design of all types of industrial machin-
ery, and student engineers will find it well worth while
to study their possibilities in conjunction with the
modern anti-friction necessities which they are required
to meet.
Timken Bearings provide the highest possible degree of
anti-friction efficiency ... but more than that, they
furnish complete protection against each and every type
of load which may be encountered—radial loads, thrust
loads or both together in any combination.
This all-load ability is found in the basic design of the
Timken Bearing, through the exclusive combination of
Timken tapered construction, Timken positively aligned
rolls and Timken-made steel.
In future years machine operating speeds will be higher,
loads will be heavier and the necessity for accuracy even
more exacting than it is now, but engineers who know
their Timkens will be able to comply with all production
demands at the lowest possible cost. The Timken Roller

Aerial Photographic Mapping
By Cedric Stephen Wood '26 E Graduate School, Transportation Engineering
THE science of making maps from photo-
graphs, while not a new science, obtained its
greatest impetus from the necessities of the
Great War. Under such conditions the usual
methods of obtaining -
ground control were useless
for that part of the terrain
held by the enemy, and,
since it was vitally neces-
sary to obtain topographic
information, other means
were sought. The most ap-
parent source of information
was by aerial observation.
This was helpful, but for
purposes of accurate de-
termination, not suitable for
all war purposes such as
map making, and also liable
to inaccuracy due to the
fallability of the observer
in correctly recording the
multitude of details neces-
sary to supply the required
data.
The next development in
war-time methods of map
making was the use of the
aerial photograph of the
terrain held by the enemy.
This gave a great deal of
aid and information of a
tactical nature, that is, it
showed the lines, concen-
trations, movements, and
other information of use to the

LONG ISLAND
staffs. By in-
terpolating data thus obtained upon the existing
maps of the country, it was possible to provide
sufficient military information.
It is from these crude beginnings that our pres-
ent methods of aerial mapping have come. It is
true that for many years the camera theodolite had
been in existence, but to the average engineer it
was, and still is, a rather mysterious machine, and
while it gave results of fair accuracy, it was not
considered an every-day tool.
At the present time the layman imagines that
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ aerial photography will en-
tirely supersede the o 1 d
methods of ground topog-
raphy. To the engineer
it seems, to a great extent,
just a means of providing
a pretty picture that will in-
terest the Board of Direc-
tors to whom he must make
his burdensome reports, a
device which he often uses
instead of a greatly detailed
writing since it shows in a
dramatic way the progress
of the job, which it would
be difficult to convey on pa-
per.
The true situation lies
somewhere between these
two views, just where de-
pends upon the purpose for
which the map is desired,
the method for producing it,
and the money available.
This paper proposes to give
a general perspective of the
subject and to point out the
fallacies of the usual con-
cept, and the possibilities
and limitations of this
method of obtaining maps.
In the field of aerial mapping, there are three
main branches or departments necessary, the fly-
ing, the finishing, and the drafting. These are all
highly specialized and are, to a great extent, inde-
pendent of one another.
In the flying department the plane is, of course,
a first consideration. Not every type of machine is
suitable or desirable for aerial photography. The

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
prime requisite is an available ceiling of 16,0000 to
18,000 feet, for it is generally recommended that
mapping should be done under no less than 8,000
feet, and if circumstances permit, at 15,000 feet.
High speed is not essential, but the ideal plane is
one that practically flies itself. It must be steady,
not subject to sudden changes of level, direction, or
horizontal angle and vibration must be eliminated.
To the layman the flying operation seems a mere
matter of common sense and dull routine, but the
contrary is the case. The successful conclusion of
an aerial mapping mission is mainly dependent
upon the skill of the
pilot, even though some
of the methods of nega-
tive restitution seem little
short of miraculous. Fly-
ing for mapping pur-
poses calls for the highest
skill and not all pilots are
successful at this work.
In the first place, it calls
for the steady flying of
the most perfect sort.
Elevation must be kept
constant, for variations of
50 feet between exposures
is often a cause of major
inaccuracies. Again the
flight must be made in
perfectly parallel lines;
each photograph must be
inclusive of just so much
overlap of its neighbor
and the preceding one.
The reason for this over-
lap will be explained
later, but it is obvious
that it would be costly to
miss a strip of territory.
The U. S. Army Air Serv-
ice considers that if a
pilot can fly within the
following limits for a
course of twenty or more
miles, he is a good photo-
graphic pilot. "(1) Fifty to eighty per cent of a
series of photographs taken will be tilted less than
one degree, only one to five percent will be tilted
more than three degrees. (2) Changes of eleva-
tion of the airplane will not greatly exceed one hun-
dred feet in flights over flat or rolling country. (3)
A flight at ten thousand to fifteen thousand feet
above ground can be held within about one-quarter
of a mile of a chosen course, provided that a good
aeronautical map is available." "A deviation of not
more than two degrees or, about three quarters of a
mile in twenty miles will probably be possible in
the near future in flights without guide maps." The
(Courtesy of the Aerotopograph Corporation of America)

MAKE ACCURATE TOPOGRAPHIC MAPS BY
VIEWING PICTURES TAKEN WITH SPE-
CIALLY CONSTRUCTED CAMERAS
usual strip taken is about a mile wide, and under
the usual methods of map making it is necessary to
have an overlap of about sixty percent.
The pilot who would make a success in photo-
graphic missions is, then, evidently not one whose
flying is spectacular, but rather the more truly
skilled, the one who can "put 'er in a rut and keep
'er there".
The photographer of the mission is the second
man of the team. The most essential characteristic
for such a man is ability to work while flying and
ability to co-ordinate with his pilot. His work calls
_g for great coordination
and the ability to follow a
routine perfectly without
error, for it is difficult
to spot an area once
missed, and with all the
details of operation neces-
sary with some of the
modern cameras, an abil-
ity to follow a routine
without error is indis-
pensible.
The finishing depart-
ment may be dismissed as
being of less interest to
the majority of the read-
ers. It is sufficient to say
that in general the tech-
nique of finishing the
photograph is the same
as that in an ordinary
commercial shop with
only such variations as
are caused by the mate-
rials peculiar to aerial
photography, such as the
extreme length and size
of the film, say nine
inches by four hundred
feet.
It is in the drafting de-
partment that the chief
interest of the engineer
lies, for it is at this point
take shape. The type of
that the map begins to
personnel for the drafting department is governed
largely by the particular type of apparatus used for
reduction, but in general, topographic draftsmen
and men trained in the particular type of equipment
used are needed.
The original cameras used to obtain basic data
were rigid box-like affairs made of wood, using
plates and held in the hand. The sizes were from
2*4x3^4 to 6l/2x8y2 though the average was 4x5
inches. There was no plate magazine and the
plates were carried either in the wooden double or
metal single plate holders. There was no means

of accurately adjusting for levelness, or orienta-
tion. In fact, the pictures were mostly obliques
rather than verticals, but since they were taken
mostly for the purpose of revitalizing last week's
tactical maps which had been originated with
proper ground control, they were satisfactory. The
present day conditions, however, call for an in-
strument of precision and that is what they are,
and they cost accordingly. The present day ma-
chines are as fully automatic as it is possible to
make them. They are motor-driven, both as to
interval of exposure and replacement of sensitive
surface of either roll film or plates. They may be
accurately adjusted for "crab" or drift, corrected for
tilt, and are suspended in gimbals in vibration-ab-
sorbing mountings, and some types print on each
negative at the time of exposure, the necessary data
concerning date, serial number, tilt, azimuth of
lubber line, elevation, lens, filter, and emulsion, and
any other necessary information pertinent to the
mission.
The lenses used are anastigmatic of the highest
quality and degree of correction. The usual focal
lengths range from eight to twenty or more inches
though the usual ones are ten and twenty, de-
pending upon the altitude and scale desired. The
speed of the present lens is f 4.5, but efforts are
being made to develop lenses of higher speeds. The
great difficulty here is to overcome the various
causes of errors inherent in lenses of greater speed
which do not affect the definition of the slower
lenses. The shutters used are the focal-plane cur-
tain shutter like that used in the Graflex, the be-
tween-lens shutter such as is used in the ordinary

POWER STATION
camera, and a new development in the form of
louvres placed near the focal plane. This latter
type has the efficiency of the focal plane curtain
shutter without its distortions. At present the best,
from the standpoint of distortion, is the between-
lens shutter. A proper filter is a great aid in cut-
ting through ground haze, overcoming camouflage
or bringing out objects of culture in greater con-
trast.
Let us assume that we have completed a photo-
graphic mission and that we have processed the
film and have the resulting positives before us.

What kind of a map do we want and how do we get
it? These two questions must be answered simul-
taneously. There are in general three types of so-
called maps obtainable from the data obtained by
an aerial survey. Some will say that there are
more, and some fewer, but for the purposes of this
paper we shall use three classifications, Mosaics,
or Aerial views, The Graphic or Computative resti-
tutions, and the Mechanical restitutions. Some of
the methods being border line cases will be ar-
bitrarily thrown into one or the other of the groups.
Only the last two are maps in the true sense of the
word. The definition of a map as given in Web-
ster's New International Dictionary is: "A repre-
sentation (usually on a flat surface) of the surface
of the earth, or some portion of it, showing the rela-
tive size and position, according to some given scale
or projection, of the parts represented: ....".
Mosaics or aerial views fall into three general
sub-classes, namely, Mosaics, Controlled Mosaics,
and Obliques. Mosaics are assembled from prints
from the negatives of an area, by matching, trim-
ming, and mounting them. They thus present a
complete picture of the terrain covered. In this case
there is little or no ground control. The Con-
trolled Mosaic is made similarly to the ordinary
Mosaic, but here a network of control points is run
on the ground and by determining the co-ordinates
of these points and identifying them on the pic-

What Shall I Read?
Negro Literature
By J. RALEIGH NELSOX, Profesnor of English
THE volume of literature that has been written
about the negro in the past half century af-
fords an unusual opportunity to observe the
evolution of the art consciousness of a race. The
process in this case has been so speeded up that a
development which would ordinarily have been
spread over centuries has been crowded into the
space of a single life time. Sixty-five years ago,
the negro found almost his only expression for his
longing and heart-aches, and for the irrepressible
sunshine of his nature, in the spirituals and work
songs: today, he has come to a position of definite
influence in the arts—notably music, the dance,
painting and sculpture, and the poetic and dra-
matic literary forms.
The syncopated rhythm that has obessed the
frenzied violence of jazz orchestras the world
round, the primitive dance patterns that have trans-
formed the stage and the social dance into some-
thing half barbarous, the indescribable beauty of
the spirituals and chanties are the most obvious
evidences of the effect of negro influence, but they
are not all. Turner's Raising of Lazarus hangs in the
Louxembourg, a permanent monument to the ar-
tistic possibilities of his race; Samuel Coleridge
Taylor's Hiawatha has a lasting place in our choral
music; Robeson, following the noble precedent of
Ira Aldridge, who played Othello opposite Ellen
Terry in the 1890's, takes London by storm with his
noble acting in the role of the Moor; Roland Hayes
is granted his place by European critics as one of
the world's greatest tenors; Meta Warrick Fuller,
with her primitive African sculptures, becomes the
inspiration of a whole new school of illustration,
crude and queer and modern, but strangely ef-
fective.
In literature the negro's contribution has been
more or less experimental and much that has been
written by negroes and by whites about negroes
has been evanescent and of no great permanent
value, but it is nevertheless interesting and signifi-
cant. The mere mass of this literature is quite im-
pressive. In the card catalog of the General Li-
brary at the University of Michigan, there are
about six hundred cards representing books by
negroes or about negroes or bibliographies of such
books. In the Reader's Guide to Periodical Liter-
ature an entire section is regularly devoted to
magazine articles on various aspects of negro life,—
housing, morals, education, migration, segrega-
tion, amalgamation, and on negro drama, negro
dancing, negro music, and negro literature. Cur-
rent Literature Contents has a similar section in
each monthly issue.
A program outlined for the casual reader will
necessarily lead by rather cautious steps into this
maze of material, and be sufficiently flexible so that
one may read it in whole or in part, may begin at
any point and read either forward or backward,
while at the same time he gains a comprehensive
idea of the rise of the negro to a place of signifi-
cance in the creative arts of America. A general
view of the subject may be got by a reading of
Benjamin Bromley's The Negro in Literature and Art
and Elizabeth Lay Green's The Negro in Contempor-
ary American Literature. Such a program might
profitably attempt first to provide for an under-
standing of the old negro as he was in his ante-
bellum days. One might begin by reading Uncle
Tom's Cabin. If one can dispossess his mind of the
clap-trap that grew up around its stage production,
—the bloodhounds and the trick donkey, the small
town parade, and the melodramatic exaggeration of
its cheap acting, if one can read it for its merit, it
is worth doing. My negro friends and my southern
white friends will resent my mentioning it, but
granting that it was originally propaganda, that it
is a distorted or exaggerated picture, it does detail
some typical features of the old regime under which
the negro lived and suffered. I imagine a reread-
ing of Huckleberry Finn would be better, for Jim re-
mains one of the most genuine portraits of the
negro slave in our literature. Then, there are Joel
Chandler Harris' immortal Uncle Remus, and Sam in
Thomas Nelson Page's Morse Chan, and a whole gal-
lery of dusky figures in George Cable's Old Creole
Days and The Grandissimc. These are all Ixjoks writ-
ten over a quarter century ago, when the time "befo

The Law on Eminent Domain
lly PROFESSOR WALTER C. SADLER
Associate Professor of Railroad Engineering
THE exercise of the right of eminent domain is
based upon the supreme power of the state
and consists primarily in the appropriation of
private property for public use, with due compensa-
tion to the owner. In its general form it is an in-
fringement on private property rights by forcing
an owner to sell, even against his will. If the na-
ture of the intrusion lacks sufficient "public pur-
pose", the exercise of eminent domain ceases to be
constitutional even with compensation. If the
nature of the act is such that the welfare of the
people of the community is at stake, the private
property rights of the individual may be superseded
by this public necessity, and property may be taken
without compensation in the exercise of the police
power of the state.
We know, in general, that city officials may dyna-
mite a group of buildings to prevent the spread of a
bad fire, and the owners can secure no compensa-
tion for the damage to their property. Again, these
same buildings may be so situated that a railroad
needs the location for its new city terminal, and tli^
property may be taken from the owner with due
compensation. And, finally, a large shoe factory
may desire this group of buildings in order to pro-
vide for business expansion. The property rights of
the owner are observed this time, and the shoe com-
pany can secure title only by barter and sale. In
the case of the fire, the state has exercised its
"police power" and the law recognizes that the re-
sults obtained justified the drastic action taken.
The law throughout the centuries has recognized
the right of a state to exercise its inherent police
power in times of war, pestilence, floods, fires, and
whenever public necessity requires its use. The
case of the railroad is an exercise of the right of
eminent domain, while the shoe factory case il-
lustrates a limitation on the exercise of the right
of eminent domain, due to a lack of sufficient pub-
lic purpose.
Constitutional Provisions
The fifth and fourteenth amendments to the fed-
eral constitution, as well as certain sections in the
various state constitutions offer protection to private
property against governmental intrusion. The ex-
ercise of the police power is an exception which
does not come within these clauses. The fifth
amendment restrains the United States Govern-
ment from taking private property for public use
without compensation; the fourteenth amendment
restrains the states from "depriving anyone of
property without due process of law"; while the
several states have similar constitutional clauses.
The issues of constitutionality usually raised are
as follows:
1. Proper Public Use.
2. Nature of the "property".
3. Is there an actual "taking"?
4. Compensation.
If the exercise of eminent domain does not meet
the particular provisions of the constitution in
every respect, it is unconstitutional. The actual
nature of some of the points in controversy may be
brought out by a few examples.
Proper Public Uses
The proposed use of the property must be for
the general welfare of the public. Thus, water,
gas, electric light, and the many different branches
of common carriers are well within a proper pur-
pose, also, roads, schools, cemeteries, parks, town
halls and public meeting buildings are sufficiently
essential to the public to come within this classifi-
cation. If the public meeting building is primarily
designed for a theatre or a lodge building the pub-
licity of purpose would fail even though the public
might receive a substantial pleasure from it. The
erection of a dam, with the consequent destruction
of meadow land may be of sufficient public purpose
today, while in the future, the obsolence of the
dam may warrant an act to remove it. That is, the
actual situation must be determined on its merits,
considering all of the circumstances in the case.
The locality must even be considered in some cases.
Thus, private citizen A cannot take land from B
just for A's private use, because if the state granted
authority for such an act, it would be purely a case
of confiscation. Very interesting are the border
line cases where the publicity of purpose is not
clearly defined, and where the Courts have given
careful consideration to this question. In the states
of the west where irrigation is so essential, it has
been held that A can put a water line across B's
land to bring water to A's land, the court taking
cognizance of the doctrines of "publicity of pur-
pose" by setting up the advantages the state de-
rives from the development of A's land. Yet the
same court would deny the right of a shoe factory
to take land by eminent domain for the purpose of
enlarging its business facilities.
These fundamental doctrines are equally applic-
able to the modern zoning laws, the development of

Modern Metal Art in Architecture
A Premier Contribution to a New Style
By LYLE F. ZISLER '32 A
THE use of metal grew with primitive civili-
zation. The barbaric became the cultured
and, with metal, advanced to the great epochs
of artistic achievement as we now know them.
Egypt used metal, particularly gold, copper, and
bronze in its vast array of vases, furniture, and
jewelry. Greece, with the Egyptian exemplar be-
hind it, attained new
heights in the metal ^
art. Here the great
doors, candelbra, and
glistening armor were
added to the catalogue
of artistic metal-craft.
Rome, as Greece, ad-
vanced with metal, in-
troducing new forms of
the material as well as
new uses. Iron, brass,
lead, and zinc were
born and fashioned in-
to the art. The Middle
Ages, too, contributed
and created, express-
ing numerous subjects
as church screens,
chandeliers, and
wrought hardware in
skillfully manipulated
metallic materials.
The advancing pace
faltered with the Re-
naissance; the age did not create, in fact, it even
became destructive and halted the progress, the
spirited evolution of a genuine, intrinsic art and
craft. Men glory at the Renaissance, yet it did little
but to stimulate a worn tradition and to prolong
the agony that was Rome. True, metal contin-
ued to be used, and plentifully, yet little of the
progressive and the constructive resulted. This
unfortunate and damnable state persisted through
the following centuries until, like the burst of
dawn, a new age was born. Today, art, archi-
tecture, culture—everything vibrates with fresh
vigor and ambition. With them, metal returns to
full entity to complete its interrupted course of
creative progress.
A study of the new forms and uses of metal is
well worth the atten-
~ tion of any student, or
even practicioner, ad-
mitting an interest in
the future of the archi-
tectural profession. A
consideration of the
subject can best be ap-
proached from two
points of view: struct-
ural and decorative.
The former, though
pertinent to the art,
will not concern this
discourse as. entirely as
will the latter, the
far more complex and
mysterious. Decora-
tive metals will be
studied in four divi-
sions: the raw mate-
rial, the available forms

AND PLEASING EFFECT
of the raw material, the
processes involved in
fashioning the object,
and the finished product, each of which will be
separately considered and analyzed.
Our ancestors have endowed us with several
metals whose utility has not yet been exhausted.
Iron, in its several forms, is one of these ancient
metals which still is widely met in decorative work.
When cast, however, it lacks the necessary proper-
ties of weather resistance, ductility, and malleabil-
ity, thereby suffering acute limitations as a deco-

rative medium. Wrought iron, on the other hand,
has all of these properties, at least to some degree,
making for a more popular and economical use.
Railings, grilles, gates, lighting fixtures, and hard-
ware are most generally expressed in this medium.
Yet, the wrought metal, too, is undergoing a de-
cline of exercise in mod-
ern architectural prac- ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
tice due to the recent
discovery of new, more
favorable materials.
Steel, a modern de-
rivative of iron, has not
in itself been particu-
larly adaptable to deco-
ration, but with the aid
of science and inven-
tion, new alloys of steel
have been created which
possess all the weather
resisting, ductile, malle-
able, fusible, and soft
qualities of the ideal
decorative metal. Car-
bon steel is the cheap-
est and most common
form, being employed
only where it may be
properly protected from
weathering and corro-
sive action. Its stub-
born hardness further
reduces its value as a
workable material.
Nickel steel, chrome
steel, and alloys com-
bining these elements
are free from most com-
mon disabilities and
considered excellent for
both interior and exter-
ior work. Their super-
ior strength permits
structural as well as
decorative use as exemplified in the New Chrysler
Building, the Empire State Building, the News
Building of New York City. A free, modern manip-
ulation of the new metals has set these buildings as
criterions of progressive architectural decoration.
Several special metallic compositions have been
marketed, such as Ascoloy, Nirosta, and Allegany
Metal, which vary but slightly from the chrome-
nickel formula and serve better only under unus-
ual conditions of wear, chemical action and heat.
Bronze is another of our age-old metals whose use
still continues. Its properties are nearly ideal and,
with modern manufacturing methods, its popularity
has become decidedly wide-spread. Formerly most
bronze \vork was cast, but now, through the de-
velopment of new processes, the metal is extruded
or drawn with excellent results especially in sym-
pathy with the modern spirit. Copper, like bronze,
is both cast and extruded, but its lack of structural
qualities has rendered it
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^= useless except for light,
sheet-form applications.
Brass, on the other hand,
is very hard and, al-
though it may be either
cast or drawn, its utility
is very limited.
Lead, a heritage from
Rome, is still used, but
in far different forms. It
has been found that lead,
properly reinforced and
supported, can well
serve for grille work,
wall finish, and lighting
fixtures, producing a
soft, mottled texture re-
flecting light in colorful
tones impossible to ob-
tain in other materials.
Somewhat like lead,
nickel-silver is soft and
workable, yet possess-
ing distinct structural
capacity, which, togeth-
er with its texture and
color, is causing unusual
interest.
Aluminum, potential-
ly speaking, is perhaps
t h e greatest of all
metals. The Steel Age

Minor metals, such as gold, silver, platinum,
brass, and pewter, all have their uses in modern
decoration; yet their theme is more of small ob-
jects and jewelry with which this paper is not con-
cerned. In all, enough new materials and enough
newly processed old materials have been introduced
to guarantee an entirely new turn in architectural
decoration. The forms in which metal is available

Clipped Expressions
It has become a prevalent custom on the cam-
pus of the University of Michigan to refer to the
various buildings in abbreviated terms, such as the
"Ec Building", the "Lit School", the "Dent School",
etc. The vogue name for the two Engineering
Buildings is the "East Engine Building", and the
"West Engine Building."
Campus slang is more deplorable than the ver-
nacular of the streets, because the vernacular of
the streets originates with illiterate people—people
incapable of sufficient mental energy to express
intelligently their ideas, whereas campus slang is
the offspring of young men of superior faculties
and a good general intellectual background. Col-
lege should inculcate in its students a certain
amount of dignity, particularly in their references
to the different buildings making up the school that
they attend.
The expression "East Engine Building" is only
two syllables shorter than the proper designation of
"East Engineering Building", and since students
are not generally loath to waste a few syllables here
and there, it seems that there is little necessity for
this verbal conservation.
Clipped expressions are used promiscuously by
fraternity men but let someone refer to their es-
tablishment as a "frat house" or to their members
as "frat bros" and you immediately observe their
resentment to such appelations when the reference
is to themselves.
We suggest that the upperclassmen start a cru-
sade against use of such clipped expressions in re-
ferring to their schools since if a custom be created
by the men of the upper schools, the lowerclassmen
will quickly fall in line.

With the inauguration of the 1932 Editorial Staff
our magazine entered into its fiftieth year. It is
with considerable pride that we call attention to the
fact that we are the oldest publication on the cam-
pus of the University of Michigan. In the begin-
ning the Technic represented the official publication
of the Michigan Engineering Society. The scope of
work that was covered by the Society at that time
included all the labors of the Engineering College
but as time went on the College assumed such a
size that the need of an official publication was felt.
The Technic heard this call and answered it, from

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
COLLEGE NOTES
Professor Walter L. Badger
Here, briefly, is the story of a man who has been
intimately connected with the development of one
of the most progressive departments of the Univer-
sity, the Chemical Engineering laboratory. It con-
cerns the author of the article, "Diphenyl", in the
February issue of the Technic; in other words,
Professor Walter L. Badger.
We feel that we should in- ^
troduce Professor Badger as he
is invariably presented to the
meetings of the student branch
of the A. I. Ch. E.,—as the gen-
tleman who is quite prepared to
ask the president of the organi-
zation, "Whyinell did I ever
pass you in 9?" He is dynamic
and aggressive, and his mere
presence is impelling. Some-
how he seems to epitomize the
good old motto, "Step on it!"
Professor Badger professes
to be one of the chemical engi-
neers of the older type, a chem-
ist trained industrially into the
engineering phase of the game.
At the University of Minnesota
he made his debut as a "lit",
but then changed to the Arts
and Chemistry curriculum,
which was a five year course.
He secured the degree of A.B.
in 1907 and the following year
his B.S. Continuing the major
of his undergraduate work,
analytical chemistry, he received his master's de-
gree in 1909.
Employment with the Great Western Sugar Com-
pany of Colorado as chemist followed, and here it
was that the germ of engineering was planted.
Then came a few months teaching at Minnesota,
preceding work at the Bureau of Standards, from
which, in the fall of 1912, he entered the University
of Michigan as an instructor. Incidentally he reg-
PROFESSOR W. L. BADGER
istered for the doctor's degree, but work on the
doctorate progressed rather slowly and before long
the Professor's rank was such that the idea had to
be abandoned.
During the period of 1914-16 Professor Badger
had charge of all the water-softening investigations
of the Detroit Edison Company
and he evolved a system that
was employed in the company's
central station plants until it
was displaced some four or five
years ago. The following year,
1917, he became connected with
the Svvenson Evaporator Com-
pany of Harvey, Illinois, (then
of Chicago), who asked him to
enter their employment and de-
sign a research laboratory. This
offer Professor Badger hesi-
tated to accept, for he main-
tained that only at a University
such as this could such a project
meet with the maximum of pro-
ductiveness and success; only
here could the requisite library
and kin facilities be obtainable.
And he won his point, for, with
the assistance of Dean Cooley,
the Swenson Company and the
Board of Regents of the Uni-
versity arrived at a plan har-
monious with all interests.
The gist of the agreement
was that the Swenson Company
was to install in the Chemical Engineering labora-
tories all the equipment that they desired, pay for
the installation, and then literally give the equip-
ment to the University. In return they were to be
permitted to conduct research investigations with
the apparatus when it was not needed for instruc-
tional purposes, and receive the benefit of the re-
search. To date over $100,000 worth of evapora-
tors and crystallizers have been installed, and in

the opinion of competent observers nowhere else in
the world is there such an excellent laboratory. Of
course we must again suggest that all this was due
for the most part to Professor Badger's efforts.
Two years ago the Swenson-Whiting Company
was organized for facilitating operations. It is a
subsidiary of the Swen-
son Company and han-
dles only the research
phase. The yearly pay-
roll is between ten and
fifteen thousand dollars
and most of this goes to
part-time student help;
its head is none other
than Professor Badger.
He is also a director
of the American Insti-
tute of Chemical Engi-
neers, and actively in-
terested in Alpha Chi
Sigma, professional
chemical fraternity. Nor
have Tau Beta Pi, Sig-
ma Xi and Phi Kappa
Phi scorned him.
We noticed photo-
graphs of some very im-
pressive mountains in
Professor Badger's of-
fice and the explanation
was that they were fig-
uratively trophies of the
chase. It seems that
the Professor's hobby
is carousing about the
Rockies when time af-
fords, and scaling the
peaks is a particular de-
light. As an alternative
diversion he collects old
books on chemistry and
alchemy, some of which
he displayed in the lob-
by of the East Engi-
neering Building the
first part of the year,
and, this failing him, he
writes his own.
He has published
"Heat Transfer and
Evaporation", "Inorganic Technology"—in colla-
boration with Professor Baker, and "Elements of
Chemical Engineering"—with Professor McCabe,
all this in his "spare time".
We apologize for christening Prof. Arthur D.
Moore, "Albert", in our last issue.
In the
Spotlight
BEN C. LANSDALE
I approached him as he was
coming up the stairs of the
West Engineering Building.
"Ben, you're going to be in the
March Spotlight." "What,"
appearing to be startled into
falling down the steps, "well-
er-couldn't you find someone
else more deserving?". I don't
know whether it was spontan-
eous modesty, or perfect lubrication. However, here's
the low down.
Ben Lansdale had knocked about several other note-
worthy institutions before he decided to favor the Uni-
versity of Michigan. He attended the University of
Southern California for a year and enjoyed a summer
session at Stanford. The sunny California atmosphere
may be accounted for, as Ben has lived in that state for
some time. His home is in Los Angeles. He entered
the university as a hopeful sophomore in the fall of
1028.
Ben had some athletic aspirations so he went down
to see Steve Farrell. Some time later, after plugging
away on the cinder path, he emerged with his letter in
track; gained for his work on the mile and two mile
stretches. Next, he became a tryout on the business staff
of the Michigan Technic where he found that it takes
a vigilant eye indeed to see that the editorial staff doesn't
frisk over too many financial boundaries. With a year's
experience behind him, our friend was made business
manager of the Technic in 1930. He succeeded ad-
mirably at this job and his administration saw the intro-
duction of several new business policies. Perhaps he had
a far sighted intuition of an impending business de-
pression. Ben spent considerable effort on the Slide Rule
Dance last year and this year he is acting as chairman of
the dance committee.
Springtime usually marks one for the elections of
Vulcans, honorary engineering society, and Ben was
given the sign of the anvil in the spring of 1930.
BcL reigns as high mogul and president over the
royal possessions of Delta Upsilon, over on Hill Street.
The Ann Arbor police may often be seen sauntering up
and down this important thoroughfare and the D. U.'s
greet them quite blandly—for they are good friends.
"Maxwellian Demons", after the manner of Professor
Dow, and elusive oscillations are Ben's chief worry in
the technical line, as he expects to get his B.S. in Elec-
trical Engineering in June.
• The familiar signature BcL is well known to all of us
who work about the Technic office, where Ben is the
guardian angel of the accounts and policies. He is a
person with a nice aptitude for organization and he has
the favorable personality, and plenty of ambition, to
produce results.
We Come Not Here To Dally
Whether the headlines read "Newest Forensic
Organization Wins Decision Over Oldest", "Engi-
neers Win Debate From Literary Society", or
"Adelphi Defeated by Sigma Rho Tau", the story
made pleasant reading for the engineering and
architectural students
when the Stump Speak-
ers' Society met the Lib-
eral Arts' society, Adel-
phi House of Repre-
sentatives. This was
the first time in the his-
tory of our campus that
an engineering team
took the floor against a
representative team
from the Liberal Arts
College.
Sigma Rho Tau ac-
cepted Adelphi's chal-
lenge with mingled feel-
ings of pleasure and
consternation. They felt
a genuine pleasure at
the friendly gesture of
recognition but, when
they considered the age
and experience of their
opponents, and when the
challenger insisted on
the grandeur of the
(irand Rapids Room, the
formality of the dress
suit, and the awful
finality of the judges,
consternation fairly
shook the heart of the
stump. The Adelphi
array comprised the
doughty champions, E.
Jerome Pettit, Victor
Rabinowitz, and Nathan
Levy. The two latter
had been on the univer-
sity debating team for
the past two years and
Pettit had served on the
squad. The Stump
Speakers were repre-
sented by Vernon C.
Praschan, Earl C. Briggs, and Leo F. Brown, rank-
ing respectively as member, novice, and neophyte,
of Sigma Rho Tau. None of them had intercol-
legiate experience, but allowing a good substantial
factor of safety, as all good engineers should do.
they sat to work. The proposition for debate was,
"The United States should own and operate the

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Muscle Shoals Project", the Adelphi elected to de-
defend the affirmative, while the Stump Speakers
had to support the negative.
An audience, unusually large for a debating
event, filled the beautiful Grand Rapids Room of
the Women's League, where Registrar Ira M.
Smith made an unusually gracious chairman. The
able judges were Mr. J. W. Parker, of the Detroit
Edison Company, Professor Rupert Courtwright, of
the speech department of the College of the City of
Detroit, and Professor James H. McBurney, of the
speech department at the University of Michigan.
A decision was rendered after an exceptionally live-
ly debate. Three votes
were cast for the negative
—the engineers had won
by a unanimous decision.
Much interesting com-
ment has been provoked
by this encounter. One
newspaper said, "It prob-
ably will be wisest for
those who have publicly
referred to the engineer
as a 'roughneck' to main-
tain a discreet distance".
The engineers have de-
clared that the students
from the other side of the
campus shall not invade
the engineering class-
rooms and laboratories
and best the wielders of
the slide rule and log
table in their own work.
Conversely, the engineer
has long cherished the
opinion that there were
many things on the liter-
ary side of the campus
that he could do so well
as to show up the Par-
nassian dwellers. Dean
Williams sends word
from the University of
Iowa, "I congratulate you
on the eminent success of this enterprise. The evi-
dence is growing that the engineer can also debate".
Dean Ferguson, of Nebraska, says, "That engineer-
ing debating group surely must have a high power
factor! I congratulate them on downing the oldest
debating organization on your campus. Now I wish
you'd send them to Congress". Congratulations
have come in from Maine, Minnesota, and other in-
stitutions. West Virginia has written about having
a chapter of Sigma Rho Tau on their campus. An-
other debate with Adelphi is scheduled for this
spring. While the Muscle Shoals team was making
ready to meet Adelphi, preparations were in full

swing for the Detroit conference style debate on
the unemployment insurance question. This con-
test was cooperative in nature, involving the Alpha
and Beta chapters of Sigma Rho Tail, and was
given before the Associated Technical Societies of
Detroit. It was of particular interest to the or-
ganization because it was the first experimental
use of the discussion style being developed by Sig-
ma Rho Tau.
The question for debate was embodied in the
form of a report of a Committee on the General
Unemployment Problem, which offered a resolution
favoring "obligatory unemployment insurance to
which the employer, the
~-~~—-- —~- employee, and the state
shall contribute". A brief
outline of this plan, with
a ballot attached, was
given to each member of
the audience. The plan
was the bone of conten-
tion in the debate which
followed. The first
speaker took ten minutes
in which to present the
resolution, while the sec-
ond spent nine minutes in
opening the attack. There-
after each side had thirty-
six minutes to use at their
own discretion. Those
who defended the plan
were Jorge J. Jiminez, Je-
rome M. Comar, Wallace
F. Ardussi, of Michigan,
and Ralph Baker, Lawr-
ence Roughner, of De-
troit. The opposition was
carried by Harold Tapert,
John Keim, George Mally,
of Detroit, and Anthony
O'Donnell, Bert Schroe-
der of Michigan. These
men deserve much credit
for their loyal and earnest
work in preparation, for
the debate occurred right in the midst of final ex-
aminations.
The deliberations were presided over by W. P.
Putnam, president of the Associated Technical So-
cieties of Detroit. The Detroit Engineering Society
and the Detroit Section of the American Society of
Civil Engineers were hosts. The judges were

in favor of the negative, while the audience gave a

ALUMNI NEWS
Leslie Douglass Anderson
The University of Michigan often turns out out-
standing engineers. It is quite seldom, however,
that an engineer with the combined pow'ers of out-
standing engineering practice, and inventive abil-
ity graduates from our College of Engineering. No
few of these fortunate ones, fortunate in graduating
from Michigan, and fortunate in the application of
the knowledge gained there, have made a success
in the world largely through the
accomplishment of having spent a -
period of time in hard, often un-
clean labor, in order that a solid
foundation for the future might
be built.
This page has chronicled sev-
eral of these men in the last two
years, men from every branch of
engineering, whose hard work
and steadfast ambition have well
earned for them the title of EN-
GINEER. Recently one such
man, whose achievements in the
Southwest are notable, was se-
lected by a much discussed, much
watched, foreign power, as a con-
sultant. His name is Leslie
Douglass Anderson.
In 1879, Charles L. Anderson,
and Mrs. Ella (Norbury) Ander-
son proudly announced to the
Ishpeming, Michigan, society
folks, that they had just received
a contribution to the family in the form of a baby
boy. This youngster received his early education
in the vicinity of his parents' home, and in 1898,
feeling the urge for higher education, packed his
bags to start on the pilgrimage to Ann Arbor, where
he entered the College of Engineering and Archi-
tecture.
His interest in the mechanical engineering lab-
oratories soon centered itself upon the intricate
possibilities of the Corliss engine, and upon grad-
uation in 1901, Mr. Anderson started in to learn
LESLIE D. ANDERSON
the business with the Nordberg Manufacturing
Company.
A year later he left his position of draftsman and
machinist, to become draftsman for the Bucyrus
Company, and during this time he began to take his
first interest in the mining engineering to which
he has so well loaned his mechanical abilities. In
1903 he affiliated with the Champion Copper Com-
pany, at Houghton, Michigan,
~ where he was one of a staff of six
engineers who were working up-
on a new machine. This ma-
chince, since perfected, was a
cross compound stamp mill, and
was undoubtedly the first of its
kind or size ever built.
In 1904, Mr. Anderson ret-
turned to the Bucyrus Company
to fill the position of checker,
and in 1905 first realized the
vision of the future when he
moved to new quarters with the
Arizona Smelting Company, to
serve as Construction Engineer.
The next turn of fortune finds
Mr. Anderson in the role of As-
sistant Chief Engineer with the
United States Smelting, Refining,
and Mining Company, of Salt
Lake City. A brilliant record of
over twenty-five years with this
company started with the ad-
vancement from Assistant Chief Engineer, to
Smelter Superintendent, in 1912, and to manager
of the Smelter in 1917. In 1919, Mr. Anderson
became Chief Engineer for the company, and his
work ranged from Mexico, through the United
States, and as far north as Alaska, covering both
mechanical and electrical projects.
While intimately associated with the mining in-
dustries, Mr. Anderson found it possible to call up-
on his own ingenuity for a number of clever metal-
lurgical devices, all of which were patented, and

found immediate use. One of these, his blast fur-
nace charging system, is well known to mechanical
and chemical engineers.
Recently, Mr. Anderson sailed for Russia to su-
pervise the designing and construction of several
blast furnaces and steel mills for the U. S. S. R. in
Russia proper, and in Siberia.
He went to Russia as a consulting engineer for
the Freyn Engineering Company of Chicago, re-
puted to be one of the largest firms of its kind in
the United States. His first assignment is in Rus-
sia proper, where he is stationed at the Freyn Club
in Leningrad. In the future, he will go to Kuzne-
sik, Siberia, where a steel mill is to be constructed.
In Leningrad, Mr. Anderson will join a large group
of American administrators and technical men
called in by the Soviet Union of Socialists Repub-
lics to speed up their "five year" industrialization
program.
Mr. Anderson was married in Freclonia, Wiscon-
sin, in 1907, and is the father of three children,
Esther Cooley Anderson, who graduated recently
from the University, Paul Douglass Anderson, who
is at present in the University High School on the
campus at Ann Arbor, and Daniel Elbridge Ander-
son, who is yet to be a Michigan man.
Mr. Anderson is a member of the American So-
ciety of Mechanical Engineers, Association of In-
dustrial, Mechanical and Mining Engineers, The
Utah Society of Engineers, of which he is a past
president, The University Club, and in odd mo-
ments, chairman of the Utah section of the A.S.M.E.
A biography such as Mr. Anderson's should be
inspirational to the student as well as to the grad-
uate engineer who is "just living." Michigan has
much reason to be proud of the name of one of her
alumni who has made good in every sense of the
word, and who remembers his school by sending his
children to partake of the benefits that he himself
derived while there. The Technic is particularly
glad to reproduce the story of this graduate, and to
wish him longer and even brighter chapters there-
in.

TRANSIT SLANTS
Tom Squift and His Electric Artichoke
Tom Squift, the intrepid boy inventor, felt like
clutching his brow. As a matter of fact, he DID
do a little mental brow clutching. Tom also felt
called upon to utter, from time to time, a low
groan, which had in its timbre that intangeable
something that boded ill for his tormentors.
Tom, as the reader no doubt knows, is a quiet,
smiling chap who has a natural flair for matters
of a paradoxical and scientific nature. In this ad-
venture he has wandered away from his laboratory
in the attic of East Hall, and had fallen into foul
play at the hands of his arch enemies, Filthy K.
McNasty and Sid Cocaine. These two miscreants
had captured Tom and had sworn (something
fierce) that they would hold him a captive till he
told the secret of the famous Squift Non-skid Pea-
nut-butter Sandwich.
And so here was poor Tom, bound hand and foot
and thrown into a donjon-like hole somewhere in
the Chemistry Building, the stronghold of Filthy
and his toady.
The door opened and in strode the two bad chaps
themselves. After cutting the cruel bonds which
bound our hero, the villians tried to wheedle and
badger Tom's secret from him. But Tom's nimble
brain was forming a plan of escape.
When the bullies least suspected, Tom thrust a
well manicured hand into his pocket and drew forth
an old, rusty Stilson wrench, apparently of little
or no value. But ahh—at the touch of a hidden
spring a couple of pairs of wheels unfolded and
rested on the floor. Good old Tom sat down upon
the thus improvised automobile and began to drive
idly about his prison. The two evil-doers watched,
pop-eyed, for a while then they began to rush at
poor Tom, waving axes and so on overhead. Just
as it seemed inevitable that the young inventor
would be caught, he switched on a powerful elec-
tric ray from his new mysterious Electric Arti-
choke, which he always carried with him. The ray,
reaching out, caught and transfixed the attackers
and held them, screaming with pain and what-
not, till Tom, now working with lightning-like
speed, chopped down the door with an axe. At last
—a clear path to freedom.
Just before making good his escape Master Squift
turned and called to the hollering hellions, telling
them that next time they would leave him alone.
Then leaping once more to the controls of his pow-
erful Stilson mount, the young inventor returned to
his lab, chuckling to himself over the discomfit of
his enemies.
Tom's next adventure, that of his auto loading
carpet beater, will be told in the next book of this
series.

Motorist's Dream
I stopped before the Pearly Gates
And blew my horn; there were no waits
Saint Peter flung the portals wide
"Jest tromp on it!" he gaily cried
And when he heard some bottles clink
He gave a smile—he gave a wink.
I sixtied down a golden street
With naught but green lights there to greet
Then out into the countryside
I threw the throttle open wide
The crossing watchman stopped a freight
To let me clatter by in state
But sweeter—oh, more sweet by far
Was when my trusty little car
Squeezed from the mile-wide open road
A Goosehound Bus with all its load
And as it floundered in the ditch
I saw the driver's features twitch!
I rambled on at ninety-seven
"And this", I says to me, "Is Heaven!"
In a cigarette it's taste;
In an Austin it's impossible.
"What are you doing these days, Ole?"
"I bane a snake in a roundhouse."
"What's that?"
"A viper."
"What is it that lives in a stall, eats oats, and
can see equally well at both ends?"
"Don't know."
"Blind horse."
"I'm doing research work."

"Well, I'm with the city constabulary. They

Tau Beta Pi
Several requests have come to us that we pub-
lish the requirements for entrance to Tau Beta Pi,
honorary engineering fraternity.
Here is the upshot of the eligibility code, as
adopted by the Twenty-fifth Annual Convention,
held in 1926.
"It is the purpose of the society to mark in a fit-
ting manner those who have conferred honor upon
their Alma Mater by distinguished scholarship and
exemplary character as undergraduates, or by their
attainments as alumni. Distinguished scholarship,
while the primary requisite for admission, must not
be considered the sole criterion."
"After the scholastic requirements have been
fulfilled, the selection shall be based on integrity,
breadth of interests both outside and inside of en-
gineering, adaptability, and unselfish activity.—
Under integrity we include honor, and high stand-
ards of truth and justice."
"The rating of a man on the degree of unselfish
activity he manifests is intended to indicate that
Tau Beta Pi believes that no man can become a
worthy engineer without the welfare of his asso-
ciates, his organization, and his community at
heart. A true engineer in our estimation must be
able to adapt himself ingeniously to all circum-
stances and conditions, making them conform to his
purpose."
The general procedure for election at the univer-
sity is as follows: Scholarship is the first and
prime requisite, so a man is first considered because
of his scholastic record. In the fall semester from
zero to three men may be elected from the upper
eighth of the junior class, grades being based on the
first two years of attendance at the university. The
local chapter usually elects from one to three such
men.
In the spring semester, elections are also made
from the upper eight of the junior class. Elections
are made from the upper quarter of the senior class
at the time of the fall consideration.
The entire scholarship eligibility list is brought

BRAINS FOR BOILERS
A few years ago when a steam power plant underwent
a heavy load demand, grimy firemen would work feverishly
to keep pace with the cry for more steam. By their back
breaking labor, six men could bring twelve 100 H. P. boilers
from bank to full load in one hour. Coal and air were fed
to the furnaces with little regard to combustion efficiency.
In modern central stations, the conditions are vastly different.
The huge pulverized fuel fired boilers need practically no
human aid when equipped with Bailey Automatic Control.
As the load changes, the correct speed changes are made
on fans, fuel feeders and pulverizers. A 3000 H. P. boiler
can be brought from minimum load to full load in less than
10 minutes time when necessary. Most important, however,
Bailey Meter Control constantly maintains highest com-
bustion efficiency consistent with economical operation.
Modern boilers can think — their brains are the Bailey
Meter Control System.

tures it is possible so to combine the separates
that the errors are distributed and are not accumu-
lative. If, as should be done in work of this kind,
the prints are made by the projection printer and
all reduced or enlarged to the same scale, and the
distortion caused by tilt is rectified, the result is
much more of an approximation to a map. Fortu-
nately the uncontrolled mosaic has become nearly
obsolete. At present the demand seems to be for
the mosaic type of projection; partly due to the
cost and partly due to the fact that there are not
very many firms in the United States capable of
doing the type of work necessary for the prepara-
tion of the last two types. _^_____________
Mosaics are used more
for such planning a s
would be done by a board
of directors rather than
by an engineer. For ex-
ample, they have been
used to a large extent for
city planning as shown by
the surveys for New York
and Los Angeles. One of
the greatest boons they
confer is the possibility of
picking out a location of
a highway or transmis-
sion line, as regards the
necessary right-of-way
without premature dis-
closure of plans. As is
well known among those
engineers who have to do
with the acquisition of
land for right-of-way pur-
poses, the mere sight of
a n instrument-man i s
enough to change the
most barren, gullied rock
growing abandoned piece
of farm land into the
most fertile productive
old homestead in seven-
teen counties. All this is =
obviated by the use of A
aerial mapping methods
which often results in an
effective lessening of right-of-way costs.
A Mosaic is subject to severe scale variation,
particularly where the terrain covered is of marked
relief; for example, an exposure made at an alti-
tude of around 14,500 feet over ground having a
slope of 3% downward from the vertical point of
the picture (approximately the center, varies ac-
cording to the tilt) and 4,500 feet horizontally there-
from is displaced nearly 75 feet at the scale of the
datum plane, and, in an extreme case where the
slope under the above conditions is 30%, the dis-
placement would amount to nearly 1,500 feet. This
causes some rather peculiar distortions such as
causing the apparent bending of a straight road
passing over a crest. The weakness of a mosaic
and that which is nearly fatal to its use as a sub-
stitute for an engineering
map is its lack of uniform
^•.^&gt; scale, lack of elevations,
^ and the inclusion of er-
. f~ rors due to relief. A
mosaic has been truly
called a "caricature of the
landscape".
The great advantage of
mosaics is the speed
with which they may be
prepared. It is possible
to obtain in a few days
time a mosaic of an area
of such size and character
as would require months
or even years to map by
the old methods. An-
other advantage is the
great wealth of detail.
Time and expense limit
the lengths to which a
topographer may go in
measuring stream mean-
ders, timber lines, and
other details; and con-
ventional signs limit
what the cartographer
can show, but the camera
gives a picture as a
whole. "While the tran-

lines are easy to find due to fences, hedges, roads
and other items of culture, and by comparison with
the county maps the preparation of the property
lists is greatly aided. This is especially true in
densely populated districts, for by means of the
mosaic many different traverses may be made and
the cheapest one found without letting the whole
world into the plans.

One of the most con-
spicuous examples of a controlled mosaic is that
of Greater New York, made for the Board of Esti-
mate and Apportionment. It covers the five
boroughs, an area of more than 600 square miles and
was delivered in two forms. The first was a one-
piece wall map about eight feet square for general
reference purposes, scale, 2000 feet to one inch (1 to
24,000) and second, 126 sheets each 14 x 21 inches,
scale 600 feet to the inch (1 to 7,200). These

mosaics required more than 2000 exposures each
7x9 inches. It was completed in 1924 at a cost
of about $35,000 and has been used extensively in
the planning of streets in suburban sections, in
planning of water front facilities, and extension of
rapid transit lines.
Another development of the controlled mosaic, is
the process whereby the important points such as
roads, property lines and other items of culture are
inked in on the mosaic which is then bleached, re-
sulting in a line map. Often this is photomechani-
cally reproduced and called an aerial map. This
is not a map in the true sense of the word for all
the original errors of the mosaic are incorporated
and it is of no more value than the original mosaic,
often not so valuable due to the lack of the pic-
torial quality of the mosaic.
The last sub-class to be considered is the
Oblique. This is the usual form of picture that
appears in the Sunday supplements and is used
normally, only from low altitudes and at a large
scale. These are used to demonstrate progress of
construction or other data most easily demon-
strated by an aerial perspective. It is true that
the Canadian Government uses an oblique method
of Aerial Surveying, but this falls under the sec-
ond classification or, graphical restitutions.
The second (nullification of methods is what the
writer calls the Graphical or Computative resti-
tution methods. These are methods of obtaining
true or engineering maps from aerial photographs.
The second method is based upon a very simple
fact. All distortions due to relief of the terrain
are shifts radially from the principal point, or point
of collimation. This point is indicated by notches
cut in the edges of the film holder and their con-
necting lines pass through the intersection of the
optical axis of the lens with the picture plane. The
distortions due to tilt are also radial shifts and
their centre of shift is a point half way between
the collimating point and the nadir or plumb point.
This nadir or plumb point is the point of inter-
section of a vertical line passing through the opti-
cal centre of the lens and the picture plane. If the
exposure is made without tilt, the principal point
and the plumb point are coincident. For all prac-
tical purposes, if the relief between two successive
exposures is not too great the two points may
be considered as coincident. However, tilt must al-
way be determined if the highest degree of ac-
curacy must be obtained. As mentioned in the
beginning of this article, the determination of tilt
automatically at the time of exposure is at the pres-
ent stage of development of the art impossible, but
if the true positions and elevation of three points
appearing in each photograph are known it is pos-

Now since the exposures are made with a 60%

place each photograph in proper relation to the

others. Having adjusted the prints it is a simple
matter to find the adjusted location of all the other
points desired by drawing lines from the principle
points of each photograph upon which they ap-
pear, through the desired points and their intersec-
tion gives the adjusted location. An excellent de-
scription of this method is developed in the Train-
ing Regulations, No. 190-27 as issued by the Su-
perintendent of Documents, Washington, D. C.
When sufficient points of the territory in ques-
tion have been corrected they are traced on a sheet
of celluloid and then by means of a pantograph are
copied to a uniform scale to the final drafting
sheets. This makes a fairly rapid and accurate
means of producing maps. To illustrate the speed
under which, a fairly well trained but not ex-
ceptionally efficient force may work, the above men-
tioned Training Regulations allow for the produc-
tion of maps from the negative of the standard 15
minute quadrangle which is about 3,000 square
miles just 132 elapsed hours from the time the un-
developed rolls of film are received, six rolls with
400 feet to the roll. The personnel consists of five
officers and forty-six men. This does not include
the flying time, but if conditions are good, the area
should be mapped in six flights, that is, six trips
over and back. The maps produced are of suffi-
cient accuracy for obtaining firing data for ranges
up to twenty miles. The maps contain no vertical
control and the error in placement of any point is
the width of a line which in ordinary drafting would
be 0.005 inch at the scale of the ordinary topo-
grahic sheets or 1:62,500 (one inch to the mile)
the error would be 26 feet on the ground and at
the scale of 1:20,000 it represents 8 1/3 feet. These
tolerances applied to primary points separated by
20 miles as are the extreme points of a 15 minute
quadrangle, correspond to permissible errors of 1
part in 5,000 and 20,000 respectively.
For the determination of vertical control it is
necessary to introduce a specialized form of the old
parlor stero-scope. This is a precision instrument
to determine the degree of parallax existing be-
tween adjacent pictures. A common form of
Stereocomparator, (see figure No. 2) embodies a
pair of magnifying telescopes each containing a
reticule carrying cross hairs or an arrow or some
other convenient figure. The purpose of this index
is to measure the parallax of any particular point.
When using the machine thus the index seems to
float in space at some given relative elevation. By
bringing successively two or more points of known
elevation under the index and bringing the index
into apparent contact by relative adjustments of the
pair of plates in their "x" direction, the elevations
of these points in terms of parallax may be read di-
rectly from the scales. By a comparison of these
values differences of ground elevation correspond-
ing to given parallax differences can be obtained by
direct interpolation. In this manner contours may
be run by setting for a definite parallax and making
the index just touch the ground even though there
be no definite detail, in this same manner elevations
may be carried forward from one plate to another
which has no points of known elevation.
Since most of these precise stereocomparators
have scales thereon for determining relative co-
ordinates of the points registered under the in-
dex, it is a comparatively easy method to construct
the map of the terrain in question by plotting the
relative co-ordinates of a sufficient number of
points by actual co-ordinates on the drafting sheet.
While it is possible to obtain quite precise maps
by this method it must be remembered that the de-
gree of precision is dependent upon the source of
the data. As mentioned earlier in the article certain
errors are incorporated within the pictures at the
time of taking. While it is possible to obtain photo-
graphs from points on the ground in such a man-
ner to use the comparator, we do not have the same
control over aerial photographs, for this reason it
is necessary if the highest accuracy is desired that
the unknown factors such as tilt be determined
and that the photographs be then rectified to a
true horizontal position and a common scale.
Now a practical method and such as would be used
where the maps of the highest precision would be
desired, would be first to fly the terrain, print up
positives and then using them as a guide, obtain
the co-ordinates and elevations of nine points lying
within the boundaries of each print. This is not so
difficult as it seems at first blush, for the photo-
graphs are taken with a 60% overlap and the


Page Twenty-Five
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
points desired are, (starting with the first of the
series or strip) a point in or near the centre, its
clearness of identity rather than its location are im-
portant, and a point at the extremity of each diag-
onal and diameter, which makes the total nine
points. For the second print of the strip six of the
points are already determined, for the mid-point is
the point on the forward diameter of the first and
the two at the extremities of the transverse diameter
are the two already obtained at the extremities of
the forward diagonals of the first, and the two at
the backward ends of the diagonals of the second
are the two extremities of the transverse diameter
of the first. This leaves the two points to be ob-
tained on the forward diagonals of the second pic-
ture and the one at the forward extremity of the
longitudinal diameter. Thus after the first picture
only three points need to be obtained for each suc-
cessive picture in the strip. Also it should be held
in mind that the parallel strips should overlap at
least sufficiently to duplicate the lateral points.
This leaves for all other strips but the first only
two new points to be obtained in the field for each
picture.
Since each picture taken with a 7 x 9 camera with
a 10" lens, which is a common condition, covers at
an altitude of 15,000 feet an area of five square
miles, of which, assuming 60% forward overlap and
side overlap, leaves 36% net or 1.8 square
miles. In what other method is it possible to ob-
tain such a wealth of detail and accuracy with so
little field work? It is from the spacial co-ordinates
of these points so determined, that the corrections
for tilt are calculated as previously mentioned.
The last method that falls under this classifica-
tion is the mathematical method. This is merely a
refinement of what was used in the first where the
stereocomparator was used but instead of using
optical means of correcting the position of the
points, accurate measurements are made of the
photograph and then by computation the co-ordi-
nates are determined and then plotted. Professor
Earl Church, Assistant Professor of Applied
Mathematics, of the College of Applied Science,
Syracuse University has produced a series of ex-
cellent monographs on the subject which should be
consulted by all those interested in this phase of the
subject. Since it is improbable that the average
engineer will ever have any occasion to use these
methods further mention will not be made here.
The mechanical restitutions constitute the last
of the three classes to be discussed. These are
really further developments of the preceding class.
I shall use as the example of such a method the
machine that goes under the name of Aerocarto-
graph. This machine is basically a stereocompara-
tor with many ingenious improvements. This in-
Again people talk excitedly
of "burning air"
When a public display of gas lighting was given in
London in 1802 to celebrate the Peace of Amiens,
people talked excitedly of burning air. Napoleon
called it a grand folly, and Sir Walter Scott wrote
that the world was going mad.
Thus was ushered in the era of gas illumination.
It lasted for 75 years. Then electricity stole the
field and the gas giant dozed through a quarter
century, used chiefly for kitchen cookery.
Now it reawakens in a changed world, to new pos-
sibilities, greater opportunities. Eighty thousand
miles of pipe lines already laid,extensively equipped
with Crane valves and fittings, prove that the old
problem of transportation is solved. Pipe lines
crisscrossing the country as numerously as electric
power ones are freely predicted.
What has brought this second greater gas era? Pip-
ing materials! Thanks to these, gas is piped from
isolated natural gas fields to users everywhere.
No matter what field of engineering you take upon
graduation, you will find its future and its growth
interwoven with the development of piping mate-
rials. And, as in the past this development has,
time after time, been first reflected in the complete
Crane line, it wi'l pay you to keep in touch with
Crane research and Crane materials.

strument can be divided into three parts, the
measuring system represented by two photo-
transits or inverted cameras coupled together sym-
metrically; the optical system consisting of lenses
and prisms regulating the path of the light rays;
and the drawing system, constructed around a co-
ordinate system.
The first part of the measuring part is the most
important. As in a transit, the horizontal and ver-
tical angles are measured, but instead of observ-
ing on the actual terrain, the operator observes the
photographic image of the objects. As in the
stereocomparator the optical system contains reti-
cules bearing an index and the pictures instead of
being paper prints are the original negatives or else
positive transparencies and are carried on a me-
chanical stage in a similar manner as in the stereo-
comparator. The drawing system consists of a
three dimensional co-ordinate system functioning so
as to guide the movements of the drafting mechan-
ism as controlled by the operator in following the
culture or contours with the index. In this in-
strument the necessary rectification of the expos-
ures is accomplished by the proper orienting of the
plates in the carriers with respect to the camera
constants as well as relations the plates bear to
each other. This does away with some of the
sources of mechanical error arising from the
processing stages necessary to projective restitution
for producing negatives from the original nega-
tives that will give corrected paper prints. In this
system as in all other precise systems it is neces-
sary to have the spacial co-ordinates for three
points on each plate, these are used to compute the
necessary relationship that the plates bear to each
other, or in other words they are necessary to the
determination of the point in space that the opti-
cal centre of the lens was at the instant of exposure.
This point corresponds to the observation station of
a stadia survey.
As an idea of the material dealt with and the
type of work that can be done with this type of in-
strument, refer to the illustrations accompanying
this article. Note the indicated degree of accuracy
as shown by the survey of the Long Island proper-
ty with its indicated two foot contour interval. Bear
in mind that this was obtained with only the
amount of ground control indicated above. Ac-
companying this illustration is one of the individual
pictures that served as the basic data for the sur-
vey. Consider the amount of time and care re-
quired to duplicate it by ground methods. Aerial
methods will never do away with ground methods
in entirety for at the present stage of the science
it will continue to be necessary to obtain a certain
amount of ground control, especially will it never
replace precise triangulation as a means of tying
together great areas into co-ordinated relationship,
and we will still need the precise levels to be used
as a basis for our vertical control, but for that
great mass of detail work necessitated by topo-
graphical surveys, the engineer will turn away from
the laborious time consuming, inaccurate, ground
methods to that method which will in a shorter
time give a greater wealth of detail accurately,
namely, Aerial Topographic Mapping.

is a majestic, moving spectacle. If one cannot see
the play, he can at least read it or the book from
which it came.
Even though the readers of this column may not
be musical, if they would know the soul of the old
negro, they should by some means acquaint them-
selves with the spirituals, for here is a whole musi-
cal literature that seems to have sprung from our
native soil. Its origin is difficult to trace, though
much of it is clearly an echo of jungle songs from
the homeland of these dark people. Those who
have seen Porgy, or Show Boat or Green Pastures or
heard Robeson or Roland Hayes, have a little in-
timation of the beauty of these songs, but no one
who has not heard them as they were sung in the
old days in the South knows the thrilling effect they
produced on the listener. There are a number of
collections of these songs which are well worth
one's reading. The Book of Negro Spirituals edited by
James Weldon Johnson, and the Second Book of Negro
Spirituals by the same editor are generally recognized
as the most complete and adequate collections of
spirituals, and the preface gives one an intelligent
idea of their place in negro life.
So far I have attempted to suggest readings
that should bear evidence of the latent possibilities
of the negro as he was at the end of the Civil War.
To effect the transition from these readings re-
garding the old negro to those having to do with

the negro as he is today, one might very profitably
read three powerful books, Up From Slavery, by
Hooker T. Washington; Souls of the Black Folks, by
E. B. DuBois; and Finding a Way Out, by William
Pickens. These are serious statements of the prob-
lems which faced the aspiring members of this
people at the beginning of their upward climb.
They are written by three distinguished negro
writers.
Another group of books by recent southern
white writers who know the negro at first hand
and who are not unsympathetic with him presents
him as he emerges and begins to live his inde-
pendent life. Julia Peterkin's Black April and Scarlet
Sister Mary are pictures of the life of negro com-
munities on the deserted plantations along the
Carolina coast, where the descendants of the old
slave gangs had remained in the cabins of the
Quarters built for their slave grandparents, living
their lives almost without contact with white peo-
ple. They are books of great beauty. Scarlet Sister
Mary, which is a Pulitzer prize book, should not be
confused with the play in which Ethel Barrymore
attempted unsuccessfully a very bad dramatization
of the story. The plot is too slight and the pic-
turesque settings too large an element in the book
to make a dramatic version practicable. DuBose
Haywood in Porgy, which as a play proved one of the
most effective productions of the New York Thea-
ter Guild, has studied the negro in his tene-
ment. Again, he is pictured living his communal
life in the ruins of the old regime, for Catfish Row-
is a group of crumbling city mansions on the
Charleston waterfront. In Mamba's Daughter, the
same author has shown us the heroic figure of one
old negro woman whose ambition for her daugh-
ter and her granddaughter impells her to work her
way up from the underworld to a position of social
respectability as a retainer of an old aristocratic
but impoverished family. It is a study of the rise
through three generations from the black mammy
to the brown opera star at the Metropolitan. Carl
VanVechten's Nigger Hciwcn is a kaleidoscopic, whirl-
ing, frenzied movie of Harlem, the largest urban
community of negroes in the world. Here, in a
strange new environment, the industrial North to
which the economic necessities of the war period di-
rected the great flood of black migration, one sees
the strange results of the first contact of this re-
pressed people with the stimulating influences of
an entirely different civilization from that of the
Old South. It is to me a terrible book from al-
most every point of view. I hestitate to include
it except for the fact that it does state a number of
problems which black and white alike must face.
I have been especially interested in this article
iu. directing my readers to a program of reading
which would orient them correctly toward the
actual contributions to literature made by the

negro writers themselves. There is left little space
to more than suggest the two fields in which they
have been most productive: dramatic and poetic
literature. They have so far done little in fiction,
though The Conjur Woman by Charles W. Chestnut
and Jean Toomer's Cane linger in my mind as brilliant
exceptions. But to the drama they bring, both as
actors and as writers, the naive, primitive emotion-
alism and vivid power of impersonation that be-
longs to the childhood of a race. The negro has
figured in American drama from the first. The
minstrels of the middle nineties, Uncle Tom's Cabin,
Dion Boucicault's Octoroon, the White Slave and old
melodramas of my boyhood days, (how I loved them!)
and in the nineties a long line of musical comedies,
In Dahomey, Abyssinia, and later, Shuffle Along, and
Blackbirds have led up to some of the more
serious contributions to his race to the drama.
There was Deep River, Lawrence Stalling and Arthur
Hopkins' experiment in the jazz opera. And in
1917, the day America entered the War, the Hap-
good Players, all negroes, opened with a program
of one-act plays. This was the beginning of the
legitimate drama of negro life. One should read
Plays of Negro Life by Alain Locke and Montgomery
Gregory, which not only contains such famous plays
as The Dreamy Kid, The Emperor Jones, In Abra-
ham's Bosom, and Granny Mamnec, but gives one a

useful bibliography of negro drama.
In the field of lyric poetry the Negro has done
more than in any other field. Arthur A. Shomburg's
Bibliographical Clieck list of American Negro Poetry
published in 1916 gives more than a hundred negro
poets who have volumes of poems to their credit.
One may trace the record back to Phillis Wheatley,
the little African-born slave girl brought to Boston
in 1753. The Anthology of Verse by American Ne-
groes by White and Jackson and the Book of American
Negro Poetry by James Weldon Johnson contain much
that is very beautiful, and the names of a number
of poets whose work is recognized as of a high or-
der of merit,—Paul Lawrence Dunbar, William
Stanley Braithwaite, J. Mord Allen, Joseph Seaman
Cotter, Jr., Claude McKay, Leslie Pinckney, Leslie
I'inckney Hill, James Weldon Johnson.
I should like to quote in closing from a poem of
James Weldon Johnson, which he has used with
dramatic effect in his dedication to the Book of Negro
Spirituals.
O black and unknown bards of long ago,
How came your lips to touch the sacred fire?
How, in your darkness, did you come to know
The power and beauty of the minstrel's lyre?
Who first from midst his bonds lifted his eyes?
Who first from out the still watch, lone and long,
Feeling the ancient faith of prophets rise
Within his dark-kept soul, burst into song?
There is a wide, wide wonder in it all,
That from degraded rest and service toil
The fiery spirit of the seer should call
These simple children of the sun and soil.
O black slave singers, gone, forgot, unfamed,
You-—you alone, of all the long, long line
Of those who've sung untaught, unknown,
unnamed.
Have stretched out upward, seeking the divine.

THE LAW ON EMINENT DOMAIN
(Continued from page 9)
super highways, municipal airports and municipal
harbor facilities.
Nature of the Taking of Property
The taking of a fee simple title by eminent do-
main is certainly within the constitution. It has
also been held that an easement, that is, a right to
certain uses of another's land, is "property" within
the meaning of the constiution. An entire public
business may be taken over, such as a private sewer
company, with due compensation, notwithstanding
the franchise held by the corporation. Of course
this right could hardly extend to turning the busi-
ness over to a second private corporation, due to
the constitutional provision prohibiting the passage
of any law impairing the obligation of a contract.
Some nice questions are raised relative to what
constitutes "taking" of property. Flood waters
from a dam threaten to submerge A's farm, al-
though A could prevent the damage by building a
wall. The modern concept is that this act is a
"taking" of the property by the owners of the
dam, although the older cases merely allowed dam-
ages for the injury. Again, the raising of a street
in front of an abutting owner is not a "taking" of
his property rights (without statutory provision to
the contrary), nor is the erection of a tall build-
ing on an adjacent lot a "taking" in the legal sense.
There is no fundamental right involved. Yet the
construction of an elevated railroad down a street
is such an infringement because of the impairment
of the access of light and air by the elevated com-
pany. A few states do not agree with this New
York rule in the matter of elevated railroads.
Compensation
Compensation is the essential difference between
the taking of property by "police power" and by
"eminent domain". The matter of payment raises
many issues. Where an entire tract of land is taken
in fee simple and paid for in money at the market
price, the problem is simple, but perhaps the utility
takes only four acres of a quarter section farm. If
the remaining land has received a benefit, this bene-
fit should mitigate the damages to be paid the
property owner. The question of benefit is a very
difficult problem to handle, and it sometimes seems
impossible to reconcile the cases. The benefit must
be a direct one, that is, one flowing specifically to
this remaining tract of .land as contrasted to the
benefit to be enjoyed by the entire community gen-
erally. Again, the property against which the ben-
efit is charged must be the remaining part of the
condemned tract, and not an incidental possession
of a separate piece. Finally, the benefit must be
real and material, not merely a potential future en-
joyment which may or may not develop.
This entire matter is essentially a statutory
question, with the law in different states varying
sharply on certain points. Fifty pages of the Com-
piled Laws of Michigan are devoted to this subject.
These laws are drawn primarily to outline the legal
procedure necessary to the exercise of the right of
eminent domain. The entire field is divided into
two classes, one where the state desires the prop-
erty for a public use, and one where a public util-
ity desires the property for a public use. These
laws establish the details of the petition; the alle-
gation and proof of "necessity"; the fact finding by
the jury or commission; the occupation of the land;
the payment; and the filing of appeals. The con-
stitutions of the several states and of the United
States are the restricting forces which keep the ex-
ercise of eminent domain within due bounds, and
guarantees sanctity to property rights.

THE MODERN METAL ART
(Continued from page ll)
to the craftsman have their influential effect on the
finished object for the original shape will, to some
extent at least, be visible in the final product. Steel,
copper, lead, aluminum, zinc, and monel metal gen-
erally are obtainable in sheet form of sizes ample
for almost any operation. Iron, steel, and bronze
can be secured in bar form varying from flat to
round shapes and including practically any size.
All metals, and particularly iron, bronze, and lead,
come in ingot forms which can be remelted or
wrought into the desired shapes.
The processes involved in the transfiguration of
the raw material into the finished product are count-
less; yet there are several which include the ma-
jority of the work of architectural or decorative na-
ture. Four fundamental methods are used in the
preliminary treatment of the metal: casting, ham-
mering, spinning, and drawing. When the metal
has passed through one of these processes it is
ready for secondary treatment which brings it to
final completion. The object may undergo heat
treatment to change its color, its texture, or even
its shape, or it may be subjected to chemical action
producing etched, vari-colored, and textured effects.
More commonly, however, the metal is ham-
mered and beaten in some manner or other. Forg-
ing and stamping are included in this class of work.
Repousee work, or metal beaten up from behind to
form certain relief designs, is a derivative of the
hammering process. This method is used suc-
cessfully in imitating modelling as well as in its
own right. Then, too, the metal may be chiseled
or carved much after the fashion of stone. Hard,
sharp tools, either power or hand operated, are
used to sculpture the metal which, in this case, must
be reasonably soft. Routing and chasing patterns
out of sheets and bars is an outgrowth of this chis-
eling art and has become substantially popular in
modern work. Further treatment is effected by
grinding, filing, or burnishing, which will either de-
lineate designs on the piece or remove blemishes
and refine the surface. Most metal craft is sub-
jected to some sort of grinding before the object
can be announced complete. Surface finishes can
be applied in a number of ways, as by sand-blasting,
acid-etching, and polishing. This treatment is also
in the usual procedure of metal working. All of
these methods have been considered in regard to
separate pieces, yet when the parts are joined to-
gether by either welding or riveting, new possibili-
ties of treatment arise due to the composite nature
of the subject.
The character of the finished product is, of course,
dependent on all of these considerations and must
be studied in collaboration with them. The newer
uses of these products are undoubtedly of most
general concern and may well consume much at-
tention. Wall coverings, or even entire walls, are
now being constructed of metal which demands the
application of suitable ornament. This ornament
has been successfully supplied by many of the de-
scribed processes as illustrated by Buchman and
Kahn, New York architects, in their new skyscraper
structures. Lighting fixtures are undergoing radi-
cal changes in character which require certain har-
monious combinations of glass and metal. Kem
Weber, of San Francisco, has designed a number
of interesting examples which portray an admirable
use of metal in its new forms. Elevator cars in our
new sky-high building have created an opportunity
for exceptional originality in metal design, as
shown by Holabird and Roots' several Chicago
buildings, in a really fresh and invigorating style.
The glistening dome of the Chrysler Building in
New York exemplifies a new function adequately
expressed and beautifully rendered in metal. Mod-
ern interpretations of such old subjects as doors,
gates, grilles, stair rails, and furniture have also
drawn from the resources of the new metal craft of
which representative examples abound in every
community.
Indications are that the metal art has just com-
menced to expand. What the future holds can only
be tentatively conjectured from the progressive
work we see about us; yet the representation is en-
couraging and stimulating, which, in itself, should
give ample impetus to continued progress.

The present staff entertains noble ideas for the
celebration of the fiftieth anniversary. It hopes to
hold a large banquet and have present at that time
as many of the former editors as possible. A large
silver plaque is to be unveiled at that time on which
will appear the names of those men who have
served on the staff in former years. An anniver-
sary issue of the magazine is being compiled and it
is our hope that it will exceed any previous issues.
The policy of our magazine has ever been a pro-
gressive one. Each staff incorporates new ideas
into the magazine every year. The present staff
wishes you to watch for these in every new issue of
our magazine.
It is exceedingly difficult to teach to a new staff
the mechanics and policies of the publication work
in the short time that they are given. The new
staff wishes to thank the retiring staff for the way
in which they have collaborated with us in the com-
posing of our first issue. We may add that the sat-
isfaction is theirs in having carried so high a stand-
ard of publication work throughout their entire
regime. It has given the new staff a goal to be at-
tained and a challenge to exceed it.

consideration. The individuals are next considered
for their activities and general qualifications, as out-
lined in the previous paragraphs. The prospective
names that have survived the preliminary elimi-
nation are now voted upon, the vote determining
whether the man is elected, or rejected.
One of the chief difficulties of this manner of
election is that often really deserving men, who
have entered the school as transfer students, are
overlooked because of individual obscurity. There
is no practical method of finding these men, so they
must use their own initiative to become promi-
nent among their class-mates.

Today—after 129 years—the trade-mark of the

Timken will help to
solve your future
bearing problems
When your college days are over
and you take your place in industry,
bearings will be one of your biggest
problems, whether you are concerned
with the designing or selection of
machinery.
Then you will find a thorough
knowledge of the construction and
application of Timken Tapered
Roller Bearings one of your most
valuable assets.
In order to appreciate how widespread
and how profound the influence of
Timken Bearings is throughout all
industry, it is jps%s&amp;
only necessary
to consider that
there is hardly
any type of mod-
ern machinery
in which Timkens are not used. The
reason is found in the ability of
Timken Bearings not only to reduce
friction to the vanishing point, but
to carry radial loads, thrust loads or
both together in any combination at
the same time.
Timken Bearings also hold shafts in
alignment, and keep gears meshing
smoothly and quietly.
Their use is both a protection and
an economy, for it is an established
fact that Timken-equipped machin-
ery costs less to operate and main-
N. tain and gives
many extra
years of service.

The Petroleum Industry
WALLACE F. AltlM 'SSI. Graduate
THE petroleum oil industry has need today
for men trained in all branches of engineering
knowledge. At present there is no compila-
tion of information for the undergraduate engineer
that will give a bird's
eye view of the pe-"
troleum oil industry
as a whole. He can-
not even ascertain,
with considerable
study or some per-
sonal contact, the
units into which the •
petroleum oil indus-
try is subdivided and
the functions of these
units.
The purpose of this
article is to synthesize
a great deal of scat-
tered information. It
will picture to the
young engineer the
petroleum oil industry
with its opportunities
and answer for him
the questions, "What
can I do in the oil
business?" and "What
future does it hold for
me?"
On account of the
great size and com-
plexity of the indus-
try, it is most readily
visualized when the
component parts of its
structure are consid-
ered individually. Ex-
ploration, production,
transportation, refin-

men with special training. As the industry pro-
gresses, prerequisite training becomes increasingly
important, and more and more specialized. When
formerly the title "Petroleum Engineer" covered
all the subdivisions of
=== tne Qj] |nlsjnesSf the
terms geo-physical
geological, mechani-
cal, industrial, hy-
draulic, and chemical
engineer are now in
common use. All of
these varieties of
engineers are work-
ing for the large oil
companies, and even
this classification
does not include the
specialists in each of
these branches of
engineering such as
the chemical engineer
who is a specialist on
the cracking process,
and the chemical
engineer who designs
the fractionating tow-
ers.
Hundreds of engi-
neers with all types
of training have been
attracted and employ-
ed by the petroleum
industry. The indus-
try is n o w well
through its growing
pains. It becomes
more stable and con-
servative each year.
The necessary result
of this is that, as
ing, and administration include all of the opera-
tives in the oil business. Each division demands
time goes on, personnel directors in oil companies
are not having as much concern with replacements

as formerly. Replacements are made with college
graduate engineers. In other words, the petroleum
industry, today does not offer the same possibilities
for quick rise to fame and fortune that it did in the
boyhood of J. D. Rockefeller, but, for serious-
minded young men with a good background of
education, there is a real opportunity to become es-
tablished in a big industry. It has seemed to the
writer, to analyze the opportunities for the young
engineer in the petroleum oil industry by consider-
ing in turn the type of engineer employed in the
exploration, production, transportation, refining, and
administration divisions of the industry, was the
best plan to follow.
Exploration
Prior to 1920, oil was principally located by drill-
ing. At the same time, schemers proposed many
devices and secret methods for determining if oil
were underground. One could have been as suc-
cessful as these magicians by trusting to the sense
of smell. The drilling method is certain. It still is
the only positive way of proving that oil is under-
ground in paying quantities. Since it costs from
twelve thousand dollars up, to drill an oil well, the
development of less costly methods was encouraged.
This brought about the present development of geo-
physical methods of oil exploration. It gives indi-
cations of oil with about 10% accuracy. Drill-
ing exploration has never been this accurate, which
is the reason ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^=
that oil com-
panies are
greatly inter-
ested in geo-
physical explo-
ration.
Exploring for
oil by drilling
test wells is ac-
complished by
combining a
knowledge of
geology, and
accumulation of
experience, and
a large amount
of luck. Of
course, once oil
has been dis-
covered in a
new region, it
is not long be-
fore a rush is
made for leases
in that territory. The luck element is thereafter
removed. Geologists can then predict the earth
strata with a fair degree -of accuracy. By examin-
ing the underground structure as shown by mate-
rial brought up in drilling the wells, they can check
TYPICAL PUMPS ROOM WITH RECIPROCATING PUMPS AT LEFT
AND MOTOR DRIVEN CENTRIFUGAL PUMPS AT RIGHT
their observations. As more wells are drilled in
this field, knowledge of the underground strata be-
comes more definite and the geologist becomes
more accurate in his predictions.
Geo-physical methods of exploring for oil are
based upon the physical properties of the earth.
In making a geo-physical survey, the territory of
interest is surveyed with a magnetometer, with a
torsion balance and with seismograhic instruments.
The magnetometer operates on the principle that
lines of force radiate from the earth's center along
paths of uniform curvature. These lines will bend
to a greater or less degree depending on the medium
through which they travel. This determines the
sub-strata formation. The torsion balance is a fine-
ly calibrated instrument for measuring the pull of
gravity, which will vary depending upon the density
of the sub-surface through which it is acting. This
variation in pull is charted over an area and de-
ductions can then be made as to the underground
structure. The torsion balance is especially ef-
fective in locating salt domes. However, it serves
mainly as a check on other geo-physical methods.
The seismographical method of determining sub-
surface conditions, which is also a geo-physical
method, may properly be called "Manufacturing
Earthquakes for Finding Oil." Essentially, the
method is to explode a dynamite charge below the
earth's surface and to check the relative rate of

mission under-
ground. Many
square miles of
territory may
be checked with
a single explo-
sion by having
s e i smographic

tions scattered

sion. Under-

knowing whether oil found in a test hole is only
part of a small pool or if it covers a large area.
Micro-paleontology is the biological contribution to
the oil industry, and has, according to some au-
thorities, shown
greater advance
than any other
phase of geo-
logic prospect-
ing.
The main ad-
vantage of geo-
physical pros-
pecting is its
low cost;
amounting,
over a large
tract, to about
seventy -five
cents an acre.
In general the
cost of pros-
pecting for oil
has about trip-
led in the past
fifteen years.
This has made
the importance
of new, eco-
nomical meth-
oil supply, by lowering the gas-oil ratio, and in-
creasing the yield from oil sands, than any other
single or combined factor."
Where oil flows to the surface of its own accord,
gusher re-
a
suits, or what
is known as a
flowing well. A
flowing w e 1 1
will flow be-
cause of a hy-
drostatic head
or because of
gas pressure.
So 1 o n g as
there is suffi-
cient gas pres-
sure, oil will be
forced to the
surface. It nec-
essarily follows
that if the sup-
ply of gas is
allowed to
waste itself in-
to the atmo-
sphere without

ods of explora-
tion very great.
The geo-physical method of exploration does not
directly locate oil pools, oil bearing sands and
shales. It does, however, enable the geologist to
predict the nature and configurations of the earth's
strata as deep as 15,500 feet. Knowing this, he can
show, with a fair degree of accuracy, where it is
likely that oil will be found. The profession of geo-
physics is a new one. Only two universities in the
country now offer courses in geo-physics. They are
McGill University and the Colorado School of
Mines.
Production
When oil has been discovered by such explora-
tory methods as have been outlined, the next oper-
ation is to bring the oil from underground to the
surface. This is the job of the production division.
Just as in exploration, so in production, wasteful
die-hard traditions are being chased merrily by sci-
entific progress.
Once it was the custom to use the deep well
plunger pump or the swabbing method almost ex-
clusively for bringing oil in from non-flowing wells
to the surface. Xow the air and gas lifts are coining
more and more into use. Not only are they more
economical, but, in the words of the head of the
California State Conservation Department: "Gas
and air lifts are doing more to conserve the national
l ..inii-^ .-I "'I'l
eventually be-
come exhaust-
ed. This not
only increases the cost of bringing oil to the sur-
face, but diminishes the total amount of oil below
ground that it is possible to bring to the surface.
That the maximum amount of oil be realized per
cubic foot of gas is important both from a stand-
point of economy and from a standpoint of conser-
vation.
Swabbing or bailing methods of pumping oil
have become obsolete in this country but are still
used in parts of Europe. The method consists in
lowering a hollow cylinder, thirty or more feet long,
into the well. The cylinder is of sufficiently small
diameter to fit into the well casing. Attached to the
bottom is a valve which allows oil to enter the
cylinder when at the lowest depth in the well, and
which automatically closes as the cylinder is raised.
This method of pumping oil is discontinuous, un-
economical and primitive.
The air lift was first used in 1886 to dewater
mines in Arizona. Since that time it has had wide
application. It was the fore-runner of the gas lift
and the combination gas-and-air lift. The air lift,
unlike the swabbing method, is a continuous system
of oil pumping. Its first use immediately increased
the capacity of wells using the old plunger pumps.
Statistics show this increase to be about sixty per
cent. The old plunger pump, while effective for
shallow wells, did not work very well in deep wells

What Shall I Read?
Three Great Exponents of Scientific Research
PROF. .1. RALEIGH NELSON, A. II,
I HAVE been reading the life record of three re-
markable men: Michael Pupin, Benjamin Lam-
me, and Charles P. Steinmetz. Pupin gave
the world the high inductance wave conductors
which have made possible the development of long-
distance telephony; Lamme designed the great gen-
erators for Niagara, which were without precedent
and which marked the beginning of a new era in the
design of electrical machinery; Steinmetz estab-
lished the fundamental law of magnetism, hy-
steresis, and developed an entirely new method
for making calculations with alternating current.
Taken together, their combined contribution to the
development of electric science and its application
to electrical engineering is comparable to that of the
other great triumvirate of brilliant minds who had
been their inspiration, Michael Faraday, James
Clark Maxwell, and Herman von Helmholtz.
There are numerous interesting parallels in the
careers of these three contemporaries. All three
rose to their position of eminence in the world from
humble and inauspicious origins. Pupin herded his
father's cows outside a little Serbian village;
Lamme tramped the corn rows of an Ohio farm;
Steinmetz was the son of a lithographer of Breslau,
Germany. Both Pupin and Steinmetz landed in
New York penniless and with no friends of influ-
ence to help them. In nine years Pupin had been
graduated from Columbia and was sailing, cabin
passage, to Europe to pursue his studies at Cam-
bridge and Berlin; in three years, Steinmetz, only
twenty-seven years old, read his paper on the law of
hysteresis before the American Institute of Electri-
cal Engineers, which was acclaimed as one of the
greatest contributions to electrical science in a cen-
tury. It did for the magnetic circuit what Ohm's
law had done for the electric circuit. Lamme's rise
was less spectacular,—a long, steady climb, but it is
none the less impressive in its ultimate achieve-
ments.
Unfortunately the lives of these three great fig-
ures in the field of electrical engineering are not
equally well written. Pupin and Lamme have told
their own life stories. Pupin, who had a rich lan-
guage background,—Latin, Greek, Serbian. French,
German, English, has created a narrative that has
charm and individuality; it vibrates with his own
contagious enthusiasms and sweeps one along with
almost breathless interest. Lamme's story is told
with utter simplicity; it is untouched by the divine
fire; it is a painstaking, accurate record of the
amazing achievements of a life having no rich cul-
tural background like that of Pupin. Steinmetz has
left no autobiographical material of any bulk. He
wrote clearly and effectively in the range of his
scientific ideas but was never interested to write or
talk about himself. Consequently one must de-
pend on two biographies, which are both quite ade-
quate and extremely interesting but which exhibit
no special literary qualities. The biography by J.
W. Hammond seems to me to be the more satisfac-
tory, though "Loki, The Life of Charles Proteus
Steinmetz" by Jonathan Norton Leonard has aimed
to bring the story somewhat more within the range
of the popular reader. Perhaps that is what rather
spoils it for me. Hammond's narrative seems more
earnest and sincere; Leonard's seems somehow in-
appropriately smart and consciously clever. The
three lives were so closely associated in the dawn
of the golden age of electricity which lay between
1893 and 1923, that one should read the account as
a sort of trilogy.
Pupin's autobiography gives a comprehensive and
illuminating view of the movement for scientific re-
search which has been called the most important in-
tellectual movement in this country in the past cen-
tury. It may be said to have been initiated by Tyn-
dall's lectures in 1872: it culminated in the National
Research Council organized, "to promote scientific
research and the application and dissemination of
scientific knowledge for the benefit of our national
strength and well being". At Cambridge a new in-
terest in scientific research had given birth to the
so-called "Cambridge Movement". Lord Kelvin,
and after him Maxwell had been the first exponents
of this spirit. The Cavendish Laboratory at Cam-
bridge, established in 1874, was a concrete ex-
pression of the new movement. The founding of
the physics laboratory at Johns Hopkins in 1876
under Professor Rowland had marked the beginning
of a similar new and fruitful period of research in
America. Pupin, as a student at Cambridge, and at
Berlin where von Helmholtz, Kirchhofer, Hertz and
Koenig were inspired by a similar interest in scien-
tific research, became imbued with the idealism of
the movement to such an extent that, on his return
to Columbia, as head of the new department of elec-
trical engineering, he became a real part of the new
movement. He established the laboratory method
of instruction and initiated a new era in the teach-
ing of electrical science. Moreover his own high

The Law on Common
Carriers
PROF. WALTER SADLER, C. E., L. L. H.
THE term "Common Carrier" has a very defi-
nite legal significance. It represents that
class of transportation companies which
serves the public generally in the conveyance of
persons and goods. A common carrier must adver-
tise and hold himself out to the public to serve as
such, indiscriminately, and to the limit of his facili-
ties. If he serves one shipper only, as a truck com-
pany transporting automobile bodies for one manu-
facturer, he is not a common carrier. This is a type
of transport service known as "contract carrier".
The distinction between a contract carrier and a
common carrier lies in the readiness to serve the
public generally. It is essential to understand these
characteristics of the "common carrier" in order
that the proper type of liability may be established.
In fact, it is well to consider the carrier relation-
ship in connection with "Bailments".
If Brown gives Smith possession of his personal
property, Brown is a bailor, Smith a bailee, and the
legal relationship is called a bailment. The extent
of Smith's responsibility to care for Jones' property
will depend on the terms of the agreement. Thus,
if Smith is merely a gratuitous bailee, taking care
of the property as a favor to his friend, he is only
liable for "gross negligence". This seems reason-
able, as Smith is not profiting through the transac-
tion. A second situation develops where Jones pays
Smith for the privilege of storing the goods in
Smith's building, Smith now being a "bailee for
hire". It is a business transaction, and Smith's
liability should extend to "ordinary negligence".
Finally, Smith may borrow the goods for his own
use, in which case it is reasonable to hold him to the
exercise of "extreme care".
The field of Transportation has always presented
an interesting adaptation of the "bailment for hire"
relationship. Many of our modern rules were es-
tablished in the days of the sailing vessel and the
stage coach. Ordinarily when our historic fore-
father turned his goods over to the master of a ship,
he felt somewhat at the mercy of this carrier lest
the master return with a wild tale of "destruction
of the goods en route due to no negligence of the
carrier". Shipment by stage coach or horseback
presented equal risks to the owner. In other words,
the regular liability of the bailee for hire left the
shipper at a peculiar disadvantage. He had to prove
the carrier was guilty of "ordinary negligence", an
extremely difficult
thing to do when the
carrier is the only
witness to the acci-
dent. What the ship-
per r e a 1 1 y wanted
was to hold the car-
rier for the absolute
safety of the goods while in transit.
Carrier's Liability
For a long period the common carrier has been
held to an "insurer's liability", and must fully ac-
count for the loss or damage to the goods. Even
if a third party enter the scene, such as a thief, the
carrier must account for damage to the shipment. It
is evident that the responsibility is enormous and
exceptions must be developed to protect parties en-
gaged in the business of transportation.
An "Act of God", for instance, should excuse the
carrier, such as in the case of lightning, flood, or
tornado. It is a situation developing completely be-
yond the realm of human activity, and relief in this
case seems fair. Of course, if a carrier is cognizant
of rising rivers and an impending flood, and yet
sends his train out, he is liable for any damage that
may accrue. Again, if the carrier has left his nor-
mal route of travel and runs into a storm, his de-
fense, "Act of God" will not relieve him of liabil-
ity.
The acts of a public enemy relieve the carrier
from absolute liability. The enemy must be more
than a mere thief, rioter, or gangster. He must be
a rebel questioning the existence of the government
itself. In other words, there must be an actual
breaking down of the protective system of society.
A somewhat similiar defense is offered in case the
government itself takes over the property, as where
a sheriff takes goods away, under a void writ which
is valid on its face.
It would seem that the carrier needs even more
protection in the matter of negligence on the part
of the shipper, and in this case the transportation
company is again relieved from absolute liabil-
ity. If the farmer leaves the freight car door open,
and the hogs escape; if the windshield manufacturer
fails to mark a box of glass "fragile"; or if the mer-
chant incorrectly addresses his box of goods, the
common carrier is not absolutely liable. Again, if

The Granite Industry
OLIVER BOWLES, U. S. Bureau of Mines
GRANITES are classed as igneous rocks hav-
ing been formed by the solidification of rock
magmas or solutions from deep within the
earth. It is an almost invariable law of nature
that magmas which cool quickly form fine grained
or glassy rocks, while those which cool slowly are
completely crystallized and coarser-grained. Gran-
ites, being of the
latter class, are re- ^
garded as having
attained their
solid form at con-
siderable depth be-
low the surface un-
der conditions of
high temperature
and pressure. The
constituent miner-
als crystallized out
slowly, the rocks
interlocking with
each other. The
great depths of
overlying rocks
which must have
been present when
crystallization took
place have been
removed by erosion
over large areas on
the surface of the
earth, in consequence of which granites appear at
or near the surface in many localities.
The chief minerals of which granites are
formed are feldspars, quartz, and either mica or
hornblende. All the essential constituents ex-
cept mica, are as hard, or harder, than steel, there-
fore granites are difficult rocks to cut and dress.
Granites are usually red, pink, or gray, depending
on the color of the feldspars. If hornblende or
UNDERCUT QUARRY AT A
AT WESTERLY,
black mica is abundant, the rock may be dark green
or almost black.
Granites are characterized by massive homogene-
ous texture. They are classified as fine-grained, me-
dium-grained, or coarse-grained. Medium grained
granites are those in which the feldspar crystals
average about one-quarter inch in diameter. If rel-
atively coarse-
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^= grained crystals
appear in a fine-
grained ground
mass, the rock is
designated a por-
phyritic g r a n i t e.
Uniformity in tex-
ture and grain size
are desirable in
building and orna-
mental stone, al-
though occasional-
ly rocks of vari-
able texture, such
as p o r p h y r i t i c
granites, are used.
A rock may have
the mineral con-
stituents of a gran-
ite but show a
banded or platy
structure due to
re - crystallization,
folding, or other changes while the rock was in a
plastic or semi-molten condition. Such meta-
morphic rocks are called granite gneisses. They
are used occasionally in building purposes but not
as commonly as the uniformly textured granites.
Granites are named from the most abundant
mineral—other than quartz or feldspar—that they
contain, being called, for instance, biotite granite or
hornblende granite. Commercially other igneous

rocks granitoid in texture but more properly classi-
fied as syenites, diorites, or gabbros may be classed
as granites. Thus the "black granite" of Little
Falls, Minn., is a diorite, and the "black granite" of
Eastern Pennsylvania consists of diabase or gabbro.
The question is sometimes raised as to the depth
to which granite occurancy may extend. In this re-
spect granites differ notably from limestones, sand-
stones, or other sedimentary rocks. The sediments
were originally laid down in relatively thin beds,
and individual formations providing rock of eco-
nomic value may be quite limited in thickness. Usu-
ally the usable beds range between 40 and 200 feet
in thickness. On the other hand, granite comes up
from below. Its depth is unknown, but in general,
is very great. It may even be measurable in miles.
The reserves of material at depths, are measured,
therefore, by economic depth of working rather than
by the vertical extent of the rock mass. Ex-
ceptionally, granites of commercial quality may oc-
cur in sills or sheets of limited thickness flanked
on either side by rocks of different character, as, for
example, at Westerly, R. I.
Granite quarries fall logically into two groups,
those producing broken or crushed stone and those
producing dimension stone. The quarries of the
first group provide irregular fragments of various
sizes, while the products of the second group of
quarries are cut to specific sizes and shapes. The
larger products of the broken stone quarries con-
sist of riprap for railroad or highway fills, shore
protection, spillways at dams, breakwaters, and
similar uses where large irregular blocks may be
employed. The smaller products consist of crushed
stone of various sizes, stucco, terrazzo, and granite
dust. The chief dimension-stone products are
ashlar, rough building blocks, massive rectangular
blocks for breakwaters, piers, etc., cut stone, monu-
mental stone, columns, bases, sills, and various
other structural members, paving stones, curbing,
and flagging.
It seems logical to divide the quarries into these
two groups, because their manufacturing and mar-
keting problems are quite dissimilar. In quarry-
ing broken stone heavy charges of explosives are
used, the rock is loaded with power shovels and
passed through crushers and over screens, and the
products are sold chiefly for road construction, rail-
road ballast, or concrete aggregate. In dimension
stone quarries, explosives are used very sparingly,
the rock masses are shaped to definite forms and
sizes, and the rock surface may be finished by some
special process such as tooling or polishing. A few

THE ARCHITECT'S!
SHELF,
STICKS AND STONES
A Study of American Architecture and Civilization
By Lewis Mumford
Many books have been written about architecture,
both from the point of view of the architect and
the layman, but few of them have been written in
such a way that they can be genuinely appreciated
by the professional man and yet thoroughly under-
stood by the average man. Lewis Mumford, in his
book "Sticks and Stones," has achieved much in
presenting a work with these two unusual cre-
dentials. The easy flowing language used, involv-
ing the two essential laws to good writing, sequence
and coherence, help a great deal toward making this
book both interesting and educational.
Beginning with the architecture used by the Pil-
grim Fathers, the so-called Medieval Architecture,
corresponding to that used in Great Britain during
the fifteenth century, he points out the great herit-
age now prevalent in the New England States,
which is ignored by most people in this country.
Synonymous with this, is the architecture of the
South country States, such as Virginia, Carolina,
and Georgia.
Following this period we are made aware of the
fact that young America passed through a period
similar to the Rennaissance era in Europe. Al-
though not going to the extreme undertaken by the
European architects, which was critized gravely
and termed Baroque, the small group of American
architects did to some extent turn from the stead-
fast style of the New England and Southern col-
onists, practicing a new type of architecture, which
like the European style at this time, was short-
lived and later scorned. The facts of this period un-
known to many of us are set down in a pleasing
manner.
Continuing with the steps in American archi-
tecture, Mr. Mumford dwells sparingly on that lapse
of American ambitions, that time when Classicism
was adopted in a few domestic and numerous public
buildings. Quoting the criticism of many of the
learned men at that time and briefly stating the
attitude of the people toward this reincarnation, we
glean much information which has puzzled many
and has been looked upon as unimportant.
From this hectic period, Lewis Mumford passes

New Law Course
Many people have felt for sometime that a course
should be given to acquaint them with the different
terms and aspects of law as they will meet them in
their engineering practice. After several active stu-
dents had recently made inquiries, Professor Walter
C. Sadler offered to give his time to teaching of
such a course, this semester. It is given on Thurs-
day nights from seven to eight-thirty o'clock.
There is no credit for the course but the material
that is discussed is invaluable to the embryo engi-
neers. No books are required and the preparation
is very meager.
The students are indeed fortunate in obtaining
Professor Sadler to teach this course. He is not
only a member of the Bar Association but is very
active in the field of Professional Engineering and
it is most generous of him to give his time and ef-
fort to this work. More students should avail
themselves of this opportunity to become familiar
with the law as they will, no doubt, meet it in their
future work.
Practical Education
We can easily divide the engineering curriculum
of today into three classes; the theoretical, the
practical, and the cultural. Of the theoretical, we
need not speak. Everyone knows that it is stressed
to the limit by those denizens of the Engineering
College who are known as professors. The cul-
tural division has been somewhat neglected in the
past, but now it seems that all concerned are trying
to make up for lost time by putting all the em-
phasis on it that it can possibly stand;—yea, and
sometimes even a bit more than it can stand! This
leaves the practical division for consideration and
we could do well to give it a bit of attention and
thought.
Practical experience is what a young engineer
lacks when he graduates from college. So say most
of our present shining lights in the world of engi-
neering. Doubtless they are right. Practical
experience is a necessity and all engineers should
be inoculated with it to a greater or lesser ex-
tent. But how is the under-graduate to get at


Page Thirteen
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
least some of his valuable experience? Why, by tak-
ing full advantage of his shops and laboratories.
It is said that an engineer does not have to be a
machinist in order to tell a man to turn up an axle;
that an engineer does not have to be a chemist in
order to tell a man to prepare oxygen; that an engi-
neer does not have to be a blacksmith in order to
tell another man to forge a complicated tool, and so
on, ad infinitum. All the engineer has to do is to
give his specifications to the workman and he will
perform the job.
But is this all the engineer has to do? The more
thorough the engineer's knowledge of his subject,
the more complete will be his conception of the
finished product. He will intimately understand the
processes which his product or project must go
through in order to reach completion.
He will be familiar with the irksome and trouble-
some matters with which the workman must con-
tend, and may be able to eliminate them to a great
extent. With those limitations well in hand he can
incorporate any such desirable changes into the
plans at their beginning, which will be much more
expedient and easier than changing the plans when
they are near completion.
To a field engineer this practical experience is an
absolute necessity. He must be ready at all times
to step into any breech and perform a task as well
as, or better than, his assistants and workmen. The
respect of his men for him will be inmeasurably in-
creased if they see that he himself is capable of
doing what he is directing them to do. Therefore
if you are contemplating doing your engineering on
the spot where the project is being constructed, by
all means do your best to learn your subject from
the ground up.
Finally, we believe that the man who is able to
turn out single-handed the product which he de-
signs, is the really competent engineer. He knows
his subject and there will be no pitfalls along the
way, which, through ignorance, he would have been
unable to foresee.
Therefore, acquire the idea of not only finding out
why materials act to a set rule and how they act,
but how to make them act. Then you will have laid
the basis for a really great engineering career.
S. C. K.
Einstein's Visit
The recent visit to this country of Professor Al-
bert Einstein may well be taken as a tribute to
the vast resources and engineering skill which
placed at his disposal the Wilson observatory, the
largest in the world. In probably no other one
place has there been such a concentration of ap-
paratus and instruments as at the California Insti-
tute of Technology. His visit may properly be
construed as a compliment to those American sci-
entists who by practical research have aided him
in his pursuit of the theoretical. Professor Ein-
stein is quoted as having acknowledged the work
done by Millikan and Michelson and others to be
invaluable in the development of his theories. In
quite a different way he turned out to be almost an
ambassador of good will, his good nature and smil-
ing disposition having won him a place deep in
the hearts of the American people. Yet, in the
smoke and excitement of acclaim, there is one sig-
nificant fact of which it would be well not to lose
sight. Perhaps it would do no harm to point out to
our State Legislature, now in the midst of cutting
appropriations for the University, that the at-
traction that California held for Professor Einstein
was the same attraction that California holds for
Millikan and his co-workers, superb equipment.
The University of Michigan can not hope to hold a
competent teaching staff if the legislators become
penurious. We need not set as our goal, the luring
of such eminent personages as Einstein or Milli-
kan, but to maintain our present high standing
among the schools of the nation should be the am-
bition of every public spirited Michigan citizen.
Proposed Open House
The Engineering College, and the whole Univer-
sity, is to be favored this year with an event which
has not seen a parallel in the past three years. It
has been announced by Allison B. Evans, '32E,
chairman of the Engineering Council that May
eighth and ninth is to be known as Open House in
the Engineering College.
Dean Herbert C. Sadler, and the heads of the
various departments, have given permission by
which the apparatus and scientific work of the col-
lege may be placed on display. The more interest-
ing exhibits will doubtless be the 100 yard naval
tank with its model ships and yachts, the wind tun-
nel of the Aeronautical Department in which model
airplanes are tested in wind velocities over 100 miles
per hour, the new diphenyl boiler of the Chemical
Engineering Department which will create a new
era in the heating of materials of high temperatures,
the boilers and engines of the Mechanical Depart-
ment, and the Highway Laboratories of the Civil
Department which cover 11,000 square feet of floor
space and test all materials for roads built in the
state of Michigan. The Electrical Department
plans a number of special exhibits which will show
photo-electric tubes in many novel and spectacular
uses, along with their regular exhibits which prac-
tically trace out the development of the electrical
industry.
This list, of course, includes only a very few of
the many displays contemplated. Anyone inter-
ested in helping to arrange the apparatus for dis-
play, or in taking part in the demonstrations, is

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
COLLEGE NOTES
Colonel Henry W. Miller
Colonel Henry W. Miller prefaced a busy life by
being born in Hagerstown, Maryland on July 12,
1884, and by securing his technical education at
Washington and Lee University where he took his
degree of B.S. in 1907, and his M.E. in 1910. From
1907 to 1908 he found employment with the C. A.
Miller Construction Company in Hagerstown, and
at the end of this time he re-
signed this position to accept
an Assistant Professorship in
engineering drawing at the
University of Illinois. In 1911
he became a full Professor and
head of the drawing depart-
ment, coincident to his being
appointed Assistant Dean of
the College of Engineering.
Then comes the story of
ho\v the Professor became a
Colonel, and quite a tale it is.
Col. Miller first served as a
Lieutenant in the Mexican
campaign with Pershing. His
position on the Illinois faculty
and the advent of America's
entering the World War then
gave opportunity for service
which peculiarly gratified his
interest in "administrative" in-
vention.
To explain, it was felt that if
America entered the War,
every man should be placed
where he could do the most
good. So the University of
Illinois decided to acquire and
classify statistics on all its alumni. Professor Mil-
ler was placed at the head of this endeavor, and in
three months some 15,000 alumni were handled, by
an adaptation of the Census Bureau's tabulation
card system.
No sooner was this huge task done than the
Army decided that its prospective flyers didn't know
COL. H. W. MILLER
enough about ground work, and proposed to estab-
lish schools of Military Aeronautics in a few Uni-
versities. So Professor Miller was made Director
and told to accomplish the job. There was abso-
lutely nothing to pattern on, yet in a very few
weeks men were taking an eight weeks' course in
some seventeen subjects, and the system devised
was so efficient that it was
adopted as a standard for all
Government schools.
Still no rest. September 1st,
1917, Professor Miller was
called to Washington as Cap-
tain of Ordnance to design rail-
road artillery, and six weeks
later he was sent to France as
a Major and Chief Engineer of
the American Expeditionary
Force railway units. Not much
later he was put in charge of
all the American heavy artil-
lery, and held the rank of Lt.
Colonel. His whole experi-
ence could be elaborated on,
but we have already said
enough to explain why the
Colonel makes a slight grimace
when asked how much sleep he
got during this period. Never-
theless he loved this strenuous
life in the field and the men
who shared it with him.
After returning home he
served a year and a half de-
signing heavy artillery in
Washington. Then from 1920
to 1921 he was Chief Engineer for the Baltimore
Copper Smelting and Refining Company in Balti-
more. Finally he was called to the University of
Michigan in his present capacity as Head of the
Department of Mechanism and Engineering Draw-
ing. He is the author of a total of some six books
for the Army on various types of artillery, on which

subject he is probably one of the foremost authori-
ties in the world.
Perhaps his best known work is "The Paris
Gun", the American edition of which appeared in
February, 1930. It was published by Messrs. Har-
rap in London, England, the following September
where it was also enthusiastically received.
Colonel Miller is a
member of Phi Gamma =
Delta, social fraternity,
Theta Tau, Pi Tau Pi
Sigma, the American
Society of Mechanical
Engineers, the Society
for the Promotion of
Engineering Education,
the Army Ordnance As-
sociation, Scabbard and
Blade, and, locally, the
Cosmopolitan and Hin-
dustani clubs. He was
also decorated Chevalier
of the Legion of Honor
by France.
At the present time he
holds the reserve rank of
Colonel and in Decem-
ber, 1930, was made
Chief of the Railway
and Seacoast Artillery
Section of the Army
Technical Staff. He is
planning to serve sev-
eral weeks on active
duty in Washington in
the office of the Secre-
tary of War in this ca-
pacity next May.
Of necessity we have
given but a brief out-
line of the productive
life of one man behind
this publication, but we
hope that it has been
sufficient to bring before
you more intimately the
dynamic personality of
Colonel Henry W. Mil-
ler, chairman of the Ad-
visory Committee of the Michigan Technic.

Seven jingling nuggets are
modestly reposing on the strain-
ing watch-chain immediately he-
low the lower border of the
picture. The seven signs of an
active college career shall all he
ruefully cast aside in June, when our subject ventures out
into the frigid business world and seeks his way among
strange men. G. Lawtoii has an overwhelming mania for
shiney keys but, withal, he is a jolly good fellow, and.
moreover, he is especially partial to Alpha Chi's. For
this good judgment we forgive him his sins.
If Lawton, Michigan, a quiet little town just outside
of Kalamazoo, has heretofore escaped your notice, you
had better get out your maps, for our friend comes
from among its unpretentious but prominent families.
The shy little freshman who entered Michigan in the fall
of 1927 has passed the days of retirement and has
stepped into the penetrating rays of our spot light.
During the first semester the varsity band found a new
trumpeter, the freshmen elected a treasurer, and the
class basketball team had an adept forward—all in tin-
person of the versatile Law-Ionian. His work was ap-
parently satisfactory, because he enjoyed the same po-
sitions for the sophomore year. Later he became a
member of Scabbard and Blade, student military group.
He was also elected to Alpha Epsilon Mu. honorary mu-
sical fraternity, for his dexterity with the cornet.
Basketball was his dominant athletic interest and dur-
ing his third year he played on the championship junior
engineer's team. His activities later led him to election
in Triangles, junior engineering society. During part of
this time he had been working on the staff of the Mich-
igan Technic and last year was made advertising man-
ager. Alpha Tau Sigma, national journalistic fraternity,
honored him with election in the spring of '30. At that
time he was made president of the organization.
His last year on the campus is marked with election to
Vulcans, service with the varsity band, work with the
Slide Rude Dance committee, and (ahem!) considerable
devotion to studies.
G. L. J. is graduating in mechanical engineering in
June and he is beginning to wear a haggard and furtive
look. Just another of the brethren looking for a good
job. Cheer up, George, so arc we all!
The Flying Trip to Akron
Bright and early on Saturday, March 14, about
thirty-four engineering students started out for
Akron, Ohio to take a good look at the new Navy
airship under construction. After a slight delay the
uneventful start was made. Everything went
smoothly and without excitement until the big city
Toledo, and then the interesting events started. At
Toledo the bus driver intended to find U. S. 20.
which is the shortest route to Akron. He found the
route 20 without trouble and started on the way,
thinking that he was headed OK and that we would
soon be at our destination. After about ten or fif-
teen miles some of the boys discovered that the bus
driver was under the impression that the windy
city (the wind is sup-
posed to consist of lead
molecules), Chicago,
was on the route to Ak-
ron. This was only a
slight error because the
bus driver was on the
right road but headed
in the wrong direction.
After the discovery the
bus was turned around
and sent back.
Again everything was
rolling fine but if it
stayed that way the
trip would not be very
interesting, a n d sure
enough, we were dis-
turbed from our slum-
ber when a clatter under
the bus sounded as if the
motor had dropped out.
A quick stop and an in-
spection by the whole
crew of engineers soon
showed that the dam-
age was not much, only
a broken front spring,
without further trouble
the remaining leaves of
the spring carried us to
Akron.
We arrived at the
hangar about 12 :45, and
talk about an appetite.
A small restaurant was
spied and a mad dash
was the result. Sand-
wiches were served and
all the pie in the place
= was self-served in about
ten seconds. Vic Kibar-
din, the only smart boy in the bunch, brought his
own lunch. He must be a well trained boy scout.
After the meal the inspection trip started, first in
the hangar. Here before us, standing on stilts, was
a mistlike mass of frame work and wires, which rep-
resented the effort and time of many great engi-
neers and the skill of many expert workmen. Inter-
esting as everything was. the hunt for souvenirs was
not overlooked, and with the aid of Prof. Pawlow-
ski's cane a number of small beam sections were

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
ALUMNI NEWS
Robert L. Sackett
It is seldom indeed that this department has the
opportunity of focusing its spotlight upon a man
whose engineering education has fitted him for ac-
tivities along such varied lines of endeavor as has
that of Robert L. Sackett. Having been, at one
time or another during his career, engineer, execu-
tive, teacher, and administrator, this well-known
Michigan alumnus certainly brought to his posi-
tion as Dean of the School of
Engineering o f Pennsylvania ===========
State College a well broadened
background of training and ex-
perience. It will become more
and more evident that his chances
for attaining outstanding success
in taking care of his newly ac-
quired responsibilities are ex-
ceedingly good as we proceed to
trace his career down through the
years to the present.
In the early fall of the year of
1887 a young man, leaving behind
his preparatory school ambitions,
dropped in on Ann Arbor with
the intention of making a four
year stop and enrolled in the Col-
lege of Engineering under the
name of Robert L. Sackett. After
four years in preparation for the
practice of Civil Engineering, in
June 1891, he was graduated with
honors. He immediately went
out and proved to the world at large that the proper
use of a good training in engineering is equivalent
to success and the ability to be of the greatest serv-
ice to mankind.
Mr. Sackett's first association after gaining the
coveted sheepskin was with the United States De-
partment of Geodesy, under whose tutelage he
helped in the river and harbor survey work along
the coast lines of the Great Lakes. In carrying out
his share of this mammoth undertaking, he dis-
played such an intimate knowledge of hydraulic
problems and such a mastery of surveying and map-
ping work that the State of Indiana hastened to
summon him to a position on the State Board of
Health. His opening task in this new and highly
responsible position required a thorough knowledge
of sound engineering principles and included the
construction of water supply and sewage treatment
works for a great number of the more important
cities of the state. Then, having
^~~ attained the highest degree of
success in this first enterprise, he
was drafted for bigger jobs.
These comprised the most com-
plete and comprehensive survey
of the sanitary system of the state
of Indiana which has ever been
undertaken, service as Chief Engi-
neer for the Indiana State Board
of Health, and the design and
construction of a number of water
supply and sewage disposal works
for several of the larger Indiana
state institutions and cities. His
work, although a great deal of it
was along arduous and tedious
lines, was carried out with such
promptness and ingenuity that he
soon became one of the most
prominent engineers in the state.
Mr. Sackett's knowledge and
experience seemed to fit him for
the responsibilities of a teacher
and educator, a fact which soon became evident to
the authorities of Earlham College, a small engi-
neering school in the Hoosier state, at which he
began his teaching career. From here he trans-
ferred to the University of Purdue and continued
as a professor in the College of Engineering at that
institution for several years more. After his out-
standing service in this capacity had resulted in his
becoming as much of a leading educator as he had
formerly been an engineer, his success brought him
an invitation to join the staff at the Engineering

School of the State College of Pennsylvania. Mov-
ing on up the scale, he next acceded to the deanship
of the college where he has been expending his best
efforts in making young men into good engineers.
This most worthy culmination to the honors
which have accompanied his unending efforts for
the betterment of his profession has only recently
come to him but he has already proven his value
as an administrator and is fast becoming one of
the best known educators of the East. In addition
to all of his other responsibilities, Mr. Sackett has
been elected President of the Society for the Pro-
motion of Engineering Education, a signal honor
which serves to point out his value to the world of
the college man. He has also held office in several
of the many other important engineering and scien-
tific societies of which he is a member.
In truth, as we review his accomplishments in
these various fields, it is no wonder that we are all
proud of the engineering school which has pro-
duced such a leader. We are certainly not backward
in offering our congratulations to this one of our
alumni body who has attained fame in so many di-
rections. We wish him the continuance of the
honors and distinctions which have followed his
achievements through the worlds of engineering,
education, and administration. It is a pleasure to
toast his success!

THE ALUMNI CORRESPONDENT
Dear Alumnus:—
Another month has rolled around with its usual
stack of notes and communications from interested
"grads." The first thought that comes to mj^ • to
wonder why so few respond to the good will of this
department and its standing invitation to all of the
vast family of Michigan alumni to write in to their
correspondent and permit him to enlighten these
columns with every little bit of news that flies
around. Why don't you, too, help expand this de-
partment to'its maximum? Your classmates are just
as interested in you as you are in reading about
them.
To get-around to opening up the news, here are a
few from the olcltimers, starting with the class of
1896
A spicy bit of gossip concerning Charles H. Spen-
cer came to the editor's notice in looking over the
January issue of the "In-Com-Co", monthly publi-
cation of the In-Com-Co Club of the United States
Interstate Commerce Commission. After spending
the early part of his engineering career with many
of the more important of the country's railroad sys-
tems, Mr. Spencer, in 1914, joined the Interstate
Commerce Commission, advanced through various
positions, and was very recently appointed to the
position of Supervising Engineer in the Bureau of
Valuations.
1897
Arthur C. Tagge recently announced his retire-
ment from the presidency of the Canada Cement
Company with which he has been affiliated since
1902. We understand that Mr. Tagge plans to re-
turn to Michigan and intends to make Monroe his
place of residence.
1906
Benjamin N. Braun drops a pleasant little note
from his home at 908 Columbian Avenue, Oak Park,
Illinois, in order to give us the dope on his activi-
ties of the past several years. He goes on to say
that he left the Whiting Corporation at Harvey,
Illinois, in 1919 and has been with the Midland
Structural Steel Company of Cicero, 111., ever since.
And now a very welcome line from George Rup-
ley who wants to hear more from his fellow class-
mates. He says that he is working hard at the
wholesale lumber business in Chicago. He may be
addressed at 1791 Howard Street.
Here's a bit of information about Edward James
Creighton. We hear that he has been in the em-
ploy of the Mississippi Valley Bridge and Iron
Company of Leavenworth. Kansas, since 1908 and
that he is at present manager of the Highway
Bridge Department. He is married and has two
children.
Thurlow E. Coon, the President and General
Manager of the Coon-DeVisser Company of De-
troit, Michigan, a firm of contracting sales engi-
neers, writes in to say hello to all of his friends.
You can drop him a line at 826 Edison Avenue, De-
troit.

While looking over the technical publications of
the United States Bureau of Standards, we ran
across a very interesting article concerning Warren
Edwards Emley. He is now Chief of the Division
of Organic Materials at the Bureau.
Way out in Pasadena, W'ashington, we discover
Harold S. Wheeler, who is making good on his own
hook as a mechanical engineer and lumberman with
offices at 766 Oak Knoll Circle.
And now we focus our spotlight on the Vice-
President and General Manager of the Otter Tail
Power Company at Fergus Falls, Minnesota. His
name many of you will recall, Clifford Kennedy,
who writes in from the wilds to inform his friends
that he has been working hard as an engineer ever
since he graduated.
The Erie Railroad Company has its Michigan
representative in George Stokes Fanning, Chief
Engineer. His business address is 50 Church
Street, New York City.
Listening in on Cleveland we discover that Rew
E. Woolley has recently resigned his position as
sales engineer with the General Electric Company
of Schenectady, New York, in order to assume the
responsibilities of the vice-presidency of the Bailey
Meter Company of Cleveland.
The Administration of the City of Detroit greets
us in the person of Martin Rankin Fisher, who has
been Assistant City Engineer for the past four
years. He says hello to everybody from his home
at 2684 Carter Avenue.
Out in Chicago Francis H. Hollister has been en-
joying life as an engineering representative of Sar-
gent and Lundy, Inc.
1908
After that big pile from the class of 1906, we are
rather surprised to find only Emerson Church Hull
in the next stack. He takes a few minutes off for
old times' sake to let his classmates of 1908 know
that he is employed by the Spreckles Sugar Cor-
poration of Yonkers, Xew York.
1910
John G. Schaub of South Bend, Indiana, signs
himself as more or less of a dual personality. He
greets us both as Vice-President of the Williston
Construction Company, paving contractors, and as
President of the United States Lumber and Supply
Company, both located in South Bend. He lives at
1340 East Col fax Avenue.
1911
The appointment of Henry Levi Ward to the post
of Assistant Engineer of Manufacture at the Haw-
thorne Station of the Western Electric Company in
Chicago was recently announced by that corpora-
tion.
1912
Another City Engineer writes in this time from
North Tonawanda, New York. Carl L. Oelkers, 39
Pine Woods Drive, recently accepted this position.
1913
Oddly enough, this little note from George Ever-
ett Brown delivers only his address. He may be ad-
dressed at 1940 Fairmount Ave., Minneapolis,
Minnesota.
Here's a real communication from the Chicago
City Planning Commission concerning Jacob L.
Crane, the city planner of that metropolis. We read
that Mr. Crane left Chicago on February 24th, on
a trip to China for consultation work there on the
city planning of Canton and also on a new seaport
and townsite. These projects are items in the vast
program for the development of China as outlined
by Dr. Sun Yat Sen and being carried out by the
Nationalist government in spite of the incessant
civil warfare.

hooked over the fence. Another statement was
found to be true. It has been said that the hangar
is so large that local weather conditions exist in the
hangar. While we were in the hanger one of the
large doors was opened and to our surprise visible
clouds formed inside of the hangar.
When the inspection of the hangar was drawing
to a close and all were leaving, the future consult-

two boys who wanted to know if Prof. Pawlowski
was the famous Dr. Eckener. From the hangar to

many of the details of construction were carefully
explained and seen.
Now the final lap started, the trip back to the

TRANSIT SLANTS
Tom Squift and His Free Wheeling Slide Rule
Hound
Tom Squift, the youthful inventor, lifted his
twinkling blue eyes and looked at the man who
had just come into his laboratory. The stranger
was rather short and was the possessor of an enor-
mous black beard. Something in the bloke's move-
ments seemed vaguely familiar to Tom but his acute
senses did not warn him of the impending danger
that this bewhiskered visitor was to bring. So as
Tom beheld his guest, he invited him to sit down
and wait for a few jiffys till a reading could be
completed on a gold plated fur gauge, which Tom
was using in tests of his new synthetic guinea pig.
The delicate reading taken, Tom wiped his hands
carefully on his long \vhite lab jumper and turned
his attention to the mysterious visitor, who was
busy inspecting the many wonders in the well
known Squift Lab.
"Here," said Master Squift, catching sight of the
stranger fondling a bottle of highly explosive non-
hyposcopic trick ink, "stop that."
At this the mysterious one wheeled about and
tearing off the beard revealed himself as none
other than Tom's arch enemy, Filthy K. McNasty.
"Now-," rasped the bad impostor, "I reckon I've
got yez." With which threat he raised the ex-
plosive ink and poised it to throw at Tom's feet.
But now the famous Squift Brain was working
like a chain of lightning and rather than give up the
secrets of his profession Tom decided on a desperate
move; one which might even cost his life. He be-
gan softly calling Kowtow, his faithful mechanical
dawg.
Filthy, mistaking Tom's intoning for pleas for di-
vine forgiveness, cast down his eyes and stayed the
hand that held the fateful bottle.
At this instant Kowtow entered, munching re-
flectively on some surds and K and washing
the mixture clown with condensed integral signs.
Kowtow's locomotion was accomplished by a set of
Squift non-skid pulmotors connected in series paral-
lel to four shiny radium plated castors. This latter
peculiarity earned for the pooch the sobriquet, free-
wheeling. To this adjectival phrase, Tom had, in
fun, added slide rule; taking the hint from the pup's
sly drool, when he figured nobody was looking.
Upon seeing this unusual mutt coming towards
him Filthy set the ink down in astonishment and
gave vent to a long whistle of fear. Then as Kow-
tow began to roll nearer, Mr. McXasty beat a hasty
retreat, screaming at the top of his none too puny
lungs and vowing never to darken the early Gothic
doorway of Tom's Lab again.
You may be sure that Kowtow received an extra
helping of cotangents and cross hairs at dinner
that night.

•*- who designed and applied electric railway equipment to
conquer mountains and to speed terminal traffic — there's a task to
try your temper!
During the business life of young men who now are students,
thousands of miles of railroad will be electrified — the undeniable
economies of electrical operation make this advisable. To carry out
such a program will call for the services of many of the best-trained
men — in the industries allied with electrical manufacturing as well
as in the electrical industry itself.
Out of college, established in your profession, it may be your job to

General Electric has equipped more railroad right-of-way and
electrified more lines than any other company. For the future.
General Electric anticipates a continuation of the vision, skill, and
progress which have thus far marked its contribution to industry

Just after we had stopped for the final meal of the
day another leaf of that partly broken front spring
decided that the stress was too great for the
molecular attraction, and with the aid of some of
the engineers on board the bus driver soon made

all went well and with the aid of the songs the
drive was made enjoyable. At 11:30 we again ar-
rived in Ann Arbor, tired but with the memory of
an exciting and happy trip.
THE LAW ON COMMON CARRIERS
(Continued from page 9)
the intrinsic nature of the commodity causes a loss,
the carrier is excused. Thus, if strawberries are
crushed in the boxes due to their own weight, it is
the shipper's loss, although if the crushing is due to
other goods stacked on top, he can recover. This is
certainly a reasonable doctrine, as the carrier has
no definite means of protecting himself, and in
truth he is not even the party at fault.
Liability Under Modern Law
The status of the common law would appear to
be about as follows. The common carrier has an
absolute liability to care for goods entrusted to him,
with the exceptions of damage resulting from an
"Act of God", "Public Enemy", "Government Ac-
tion" or "Shipper's Negligence". This situation has
resulted in heavy "over short and damage" claims
against the railroad, with the carrier seeking some
definite form of relief. There is a tendency in re-
cent years to limit the liability by means of the bill
of lading, or contract of shipment. A shipper is
given the option of two freight rates, the higher
rate generally carrying liability for the full market
value, the lower rate offering a partial valuation in
case of loss or damage. The difference between
these two freight rates amounts to an insurance
premium, and the courts have held the higher rate
must not be so high as to exceed the insurance rate
reasonable under the given risks of transportation.
A most important point is that the carrier cannot
be relieved from the damages due to his own negli-
gence. That is, it is against public policy to have
the carrier offer such a cheap rate that the shipper
will assume the full risk of the shipment.
An interesting aspect of this problem arises in
connection with the period of time during which
the carrier is liable as an "insurer". The railroad,
for instance, must have actually received the goods
and be in possession of them. Whether the bill of
lading is already executed appears immaterial. Of
course, the person receiving the goods must be a re-
sponsible agent of the carrier. The delivery of the
goods at destination offers a somewhat more com-
plex case, with the law in conflict. One group of
states relieves the railroad from an "insurer's" lia-
bility as soon as he has delivered the goods into his
freight depot; another group holds that the railroad
has a carrier's liability until the consignee has had
a reasonable time to call for the same; while the
third group requires that the carrier have con-
structive notice that the goods have arrived and
that he be given a reasonable time to call for the
same.
Another problem arises where there is damage to
goods on an "inter-line" route, where the shipment
has traveled over several railroads. The first rule
holds that the receiving railroad is the responsible
party, and requires the first railroad to collect from
the other railroads. This is based on the doctrine
of agency, assuming all succeeding lines are the
agents of the first line. The second rule holds each
line is the agent of the shipper, with the negligent
railroad as the responsible party. This situation
makes it particularly difficult for the shipper to ob-
tain relief. The present American doctrine holds
the negligent railroad responsible, but maintains
that the possession of a damaged shipment is prima
facie evidence that the party in possession is at
fault. This is a very workable method, each com-
pany being careful to refuse a defective shipment
at interchange terminals.

scholarly ideals made his own research highly in-
fluential.
In his preface to his autobiography he says, "The
main object of my narrative was, and still is, to
describe the rise of Idealism in American science,
and particularly in physical sciences and the re-
lated industries." It is this purpose running
through his narrative that makes it really epic in its
character. His invention of the Pupin coil, i.e., the
high inductance wave coil, which was acquired by
the American Telephone and Telegraph Company,
is said to have saved that company in its develop-
ment of its long-distance systems one hundred mil-
lion dollars. Yet unquestionably the flaming torch
of his idealism held so unwaveringly high was an
ultimate service to the shaping of the research
movement of even greater significance and value.
Benjamin Lamme's account of his own life—it is

when holes no longer followed straight vertical
lines.
The principle of the plunger pump is the same as
that of our deep well water pumps with which most
people are familiar. The plunger is at the bottom
of the well casing. It pushes an ever increasing
column of liquid above it. The one way valve in
the plunger allows liquid to rise but will not let it
fall. With this pump, wear was excessive and ca-
pacity low.

The air lift operates on the principle of Charles'
Law. Air, under pressure, is injected below the
liquid level in the bottom of the casing. As the
air bubble rises in column, the pressure exerted
upon it by the diminishing height of liquid, be-
comes less and its volume increases. This expan-
sion raises the liquid level. For example, if air at
the pressure existing at the bottom of the well oc-
cupies one cubic foot, and occupies 27 cubic feet at
the liquid level, the oil level in the casing of one
square foot cross sectional area will rise 26 feet.
Furthermore, as additional quantities of air are in-
jected, the liquid level will rise higher and higher.
The rising bubbles of air will carry with them slugs
of oil. As the bubbles of air are made to become
smaller, the flo\v becomes a uniform steady stream.
Pumping oil by the air or gas lift is sometimes re-
ferred to as the foaming method.
The gas lift naturally followed the air lift because
there are in many cases immense quantities of gas
stored underground with oil. Using the gas lift in
conjunction with gas that is stored underground,
obviated the necessity of pumping compressed air
or gas down to the bottom of the casing to carry
up the oil. The problem then was to use this gas as
economically as possible and bring to the surface
with it the maximum amount of oil. To accom-
plish this, various devices have been used to build
up back pressure. These devices consisted of pack-
ings, orifices, and back pressure plugs. An addi-
tional advantage of the gas over the air lift is that
corrosion of casing pipes is materially reduced,
especially in dealing with gases that contain large
amounts of hydrogen sulphide.
It is found that some of the original oil wells, in
which but twenty per cent of the total available oil
was removed, have been so flooded with water as
to make it uneconomical to remove the balance of
oil. It is therefore imperative, that once pumping
operations have commenced they be continued un-
til as much as possible of the petroleum has been
brought to the surface.
To obtain the greatest possible yield of oil from
oil bearing sands many and ingenious schemes have
been devised. They are the methods that use the
pressure of gas, air, and water. The pressure makes
the oil flow toward the low-pressure area at the
bottom of the casing. This is accomplished by
drilling one or more wells, other than those used
to remove oil, into the oil bearing sands. Pressure
is carried down these wells and the condition of a
natural flowing well is created artificially. By this
method of creating an artificial pressure with either
water, gas, or air, many supposedly barren sands
have yielded thousands of additional barrels of oil.
Transportation
Transportation, the third phase of the oil indus-
try, has had an interesting development. It has
been aptly said: "The history of transportation is
the history of human progress and development."
This quotation applies to the oil industry in partic-
ular.
It was not until oil companies stopped building
refineries at every boom field, that the United States
leaped to the foremost position in the oil industry.
With refineries costing from four to five million
dollars and more to erect, it was found cheaper to
bring the oil to the refinery than to bring the re-
finery to the oil. The result is that the pipe-line
business is now an industry in itself. Each year

it absorbs millions of dollars of invested capital. It
now seems a far cry from the time when the ques-
tion was debatable whether oil could be transported
through pipes as well as water.
In the early days of the industry, the discovery
of a boom field was the signal for the building of
one or more huge refineries in the boom territory.
As a result thousands of dollars have been lost
when boom fields did not live up to expectations.
Even as our great business men learn by experience,
refineries began to be located at strategic points, so
as to be accessible to highways, railroads, and
navigable streams by means of which the oil was
transported to refineries in barrels.
This system of transportation was dependent up-
on weather conditions and upon the human element.
Both of these variables were bad but the human
element was the least dependable. Strikes were
not uncommon. Labor had the upper hand and la-
bor knew it.
The construction of the first oil pipe line was
considered an impractical experiment. The econ-
omy effected, however, soon became apparent.
Popularity then increased by leaps and bounds.
Thousands of teamsters, who saw their means of
livelihood disappearing, attempted to discredit the
pipe line companies in every conceivable manner.
In spite of this, progress could not be stopped. Pipe
line companies showed a big saving in time, money,
and capacity. As a consequence their use became
widespread. The first pipe line was less than a mile
in length. There is now a net-work of pipe lines
that soon promises to reach from New York to
California and from Michigan to Texas. There is
now one under construction that will be 1400 miles
in length.
Mexican crude oil is very heavy. It was at first
thought that it could not be pumped. But by spac-
ing the booster pumps closer than usual, little diffi-
culty was experienced. A similar heavy crude oil
is obtained in California. During cold weather it
becomes so viscous that it will hardly pour. The
problem of pumping this oil has been solved by
heating. This reduces viscosity. It has proved
economical, has speeded up flow, and is now the
common method of lowering the viscosity of heavy
crudes. When viscosity is lowered the crudes can
be pumped. Crude oil in Mexico can be pumped
without heating while crude oil of the same gravity
in California must be heated because the average
temperature of the atmosphere is sufficiently high
to keep the oil fluid.
The principles of oil transportation by pipe line
are comparatively simple. Large booster pumps,
usually operated by Diesel engines, are placed along
the pipe line at intervals of ten to sixty miles. The
pipe lines used are four, six, eight, ten, and twelve
inches in diameter. Storage tanks, usually two in

supply of oil, are at each pumping station. One
tank is filled while the other is being discharged.
If it is necessary to heat the oil, steam engines in-
stead of Diesel engines are used. This utilizes the
exhaust steam.
Refining
Refining, the fourth division of the oil industry,
has an interesting historical background. About
1855, petroleum was first distilled in this country and
a product known as "rock oil" obtained. A Pitts-
burgh druggist, Samuel Kier, first distilled petro-
leum with a crude adaptation of the coal distillation
equipment, then being introduced from England.
In 1859, the famous Drake Well came in. This
started the petroleum industry off to achieve the
tremendous rate of growth that has made its prod-
ucts exceed in value all of our other mineral prod-
ucts. Continuous improvements in refinery oper-
ation and equipment have evolved the continuous
fractionating tower starting from the crude batch
still. The technique of refinery operation and con-
trol has been improved so that many operations
that formerly were manual are now automatic in
operation and control.
The batch shell still was first used to refine pe-
troleum. It consists of a cylindrical hollow tank
with an opening at the top for the escape of vapors.
The tank is supported on a brick foundation and
fired from below with oil or gas. As the tempera-
ture in the tank rises, vapors are given off. The
temperature at which the vapors come out of the
tank determine the characteristics of the fraction.
These vapors are condensed in water or air cooled
condensers. The vapors contain gasoline, k'erosene,
gas oil, or fuel oil, and wax distillate. The residium
is that fraction left in the still after the more vola-
tile components have been driven off. It is removed
and either further heated to make petroleum coke,
after the bright stock has been removed, or it is
used as such for tar substitutes.
The reader is probably familiar with the use of
gasoline and kerosene. Gas or fuel oil is used for
fuel purposes. The wax distillates when cooled
give paraffin wax. The balance of the unsolidified
fraction is mixed with the bright stock. In distill-
ing Mexican or California crudes, which are nap-
t/.ene base, no wax is obtained. It is only in the
Pennsylvania or paraffin base crude oils that we
have wax. Bright stock is the source of lubricat-
ing oils and greases. Heavy or light oils are ob-
tained by adding or removing some of the more
volatile components from bright stock.
The products are but the main ones obtained in
distilling petroleum. Each one of these is the
source of still other petroleum products. For ex-
ample, gasoline is subdivided into low, medium, and
high test and further subdivided in respect to its
anti-knock properties.
Present day refining practice is not completely

of steam per minute for an hours time. This gigantic load
pick-up was brought about by a single operator!
On each boiler control panel near the push button controls
were his operating guides—Bailey Boiler Meters and Multi-
Pointer Gages. They told him when to send his electrical
orders over copper nerves to huge fans, to whirring coal
feeders, and to rumbling pulverizers. Most important of all,
they enabled him to maintain efficient combustion during
the entire change from light load to full load.
Giant boilers pouring forth steam; hundreds of offices
comfortably heated; one man with the aid of Bailey
Meters doing the work of 100 —this is progress.

standardized. The continuous fractionating tower
has supplanted batch stills. All new units now un-
der construction utilize some form of fractionating
or bubble tower in connection with the more effi-
cient and popular pipe still or heater. The differ-
ence between this and batch still operation is that
the various products are given off in a continuous
stream in the fractionating tower. The capacity
and economy are also much greater.
In a fractionating column or tower, the volatile
vapors go up the tower and the less volatile liquid
descends. At any time, there is an even distribu-
tion through the column, with the most volatile
compounds going out the top as vapors and the less
volatile overflowing the plates are going to the
bottom. Any fraction of intermediate volatility is
obtained by drawing liquid of desired composition
off the plate holding liquid of that composition.
The problems of oil refining are becoming so com-
plex that training in chemical engineering is a
necessary prerequisite for work in this field. Be-
cause chemical engineering is an inexact science, it
is necessary to make many assumptions and ap-
proximations. These assumptions are made on the
basis of theoretically ideal conditions and the ex-
tent to which these ideal conditions are influenced
by outside forces. Rapid strides are being made to
take much of the guesswork out of oil refining prob-
lems.
Administration
The organization and administration of a large
oil company is very complex and involved. In few
businesses does one concern engage in exploration,
production and transportation of the finished prod-
ucts. Administration means the control of all these
unit operations. Each oil company strives for self-
sufficiency. Not only is this true of the larger com-
panies, but smaller ones too are aiming for inde-
pendence. It is believed that only in independence
will they survive.
Overproduction, the alleged cause of the 1930
economic depression, has also caused a depression
in the oil industry. That it has in this case, at
least, been a true cause was shown in the recent
meeting in Chicago of the Volunteer Committee on
Petroleum Economics of the American Petroleum
Institute. It was estimated that the gasoline con-
sumption for the six month period commencing
October first, 1930 would be the same as for a year
ago. If refineries continue to operate at their Octo-
ber rate, there will be an overproduction of twenty
eight million barrels of gasoline. It is recommended
that production be curtailed seven per cent to ab-
sorb this excess.

The oil industry has witnessed many a bitter
battle between competing companies for business.
Ever present was the lurking danger of having the
government step in to control the situation. Price
wars, price fixing and the cry of monopoly has many
times brought oil to the front page of the newspa-
pers and of the business periodicals. The danger of
government control is still present. It has been
said by some of the ablest men in the industry that
if the oil business will not of itself set its house in
order, it can be expected that the government will
handle the oil industry as it did the railroads.
There are interesting economic problems in the
oil industry. One of the most interesting is that of
duplication of marketing facilities with consequent
economic loss. It seems economically unsound that
if a town of five thousand population has three com-
peting oil stations on three of the most expensive
and desirable corners when one station could take
care of all of the actual and immediate potential
business, something is radically wrong in the in-
dustry. Profits are too great or there is an un-
necessary lack of cooperation between competing
companies.
Harry F. Sinclair, head of the large oil company
bearing his name, says that the average citizen is
becoming tired of seeing the highways cluttered
with needless and unsightly filling stations. Fortu-

BOLTS 8 times as strong under superheat
as "before the war"
Trace the evolution of the bolt since 1913 and you
trace the amazing post war advance of power and
industrial processes . . . and the Crane contribution
to help make it possible.
In carefree days "before the war," a steel bolt was a
steel bolt. It was made of any easily obtained steel that
forged easily and took threads well. Industry moved
forward ... stronger bolts were asked for. Ordinary
steels were improved to tensile strength of 45,000
pounds. Not enough. A bolt with forged-on head
and tensile strength of 50,000 pounds was devel-
oped. Still not enough. Cold rolled steel bolts with
tensile strength of 80,000 pounds were offered.
They had a tendency to snap.
To fully meet the demands of modern high pressure
and temperature technology, Crane Co. brought out
for its cast and forged steel materials their Triplex
steel stud bolts, of chrome nickel steel with tensile
strength of 125,000 pounds. The limit is not yet.
Even now, Crane Co. can supply bolts for valve
bonnets and flanges with tensile strength of 140,000
pounds and retaining strength at well past iooo°F.
By exhaustive laboratory investigations, long care-
fully charted creep tests, detailed study of service
conditions, Crane metallurgists have helped this de-
velopment. With the same scientific methods they
have as strikingly improved bodies,bonnets, discs and
seats, stems, packing boxes... so that Crane valves and
fittings can be supplied for higher pressures and tem-
peratures than have yet been commercially projected.

nately, this condition is rapidly passing. Evidence
of cooperation is shown by the 1400 mile gasolene
pipe line under construction from the Oklahoma re-
fineries to Kansas City, Des Moines, the Twin
Cities, Chicago, Milwaukee, and intermediate
points. This pipe line is being jointly built by six
oil companies. The future will undoubtedly show
more of this sort of cooperation for the benefit of
the industry in particular and for the benefit of
the public as a whole.
Summary
The petroleum oil business is becoming more im-
portant every year, with the enormous increase in
usage of its products. It has been shown that prac-
tically all kinds of engineers contribute to the oper-
ation and advancement of the oil industry in the di-
verse fields of: exploration, production, transporta-
tion, refining, and administration. Thus, opportun-
ities exist for the geo-physicist, the mechanical engi-
neer, the chemical engineer, and the industrial engi-
neer. This is a ripe field and certainly has need for
alert men trained in all branches of engineering
knowledge.

electrical machinery for the Westinghouse System
from a purely cut-and-try, emperical method, to a
method based on pre-calculated designs. While he
was still a mere subordinate in the testing room, he
designed and built a double reduction gear railway
motor from calculations made by analysis. From
that he developed his system till he had designed
the great generators for the Niagara Plant and the
new and novel apparatus for the Chicago World's
Fair Exhibit. Lamme traces his development of in-
duction motors, equalizers, rotary converters, turbo-
generators, and railway electrification. His contri-
bution to electrical engineering, while it had its
basis in pure mathematical science, was definitely
in the field of design.
Steinmetz, physically a dwarf, a gnome, but in-
tellectually a titan, had even before his death in
1923 become a mythical figure about which had
gathered an almost unbelievable body of exagger-
ated legends. But even the most searching effort to
reduce this to bald fact, makes the little man loom
large in the field of electrical science. When in 1902
Dr. Charles Elliot of Harvard conferred on him an
honorary degree, he called him, "the foremost elec-
trical engineer in the United States and therefore in
the world".
In his own estimate of his work he regarded as
his most important contributions; first, his re-
searches of magnetism; second, his development of
methods for making calculations with alternating
current; and third, his general study and theory of
electrical transients. His little research laboratory

meyer, and his laboratory at Schenectady, where
from 1892 till his death he was the supreme genius
of the General Electric Company, are historic spots
in the development of electrical science. His inven-
tion of the magnetic arc lamp, his work in long-dis-
tance transmission, his development of the lightning
arrester, and the lighting generator, important as
they are, seem to dwarf into insignificance in com-
parison with his great achievements in the field of
pure science. He was unquestionably the most
amazing genius of his generation. As Professor of
Electrical Engineering at Union College, as author
of a large series of texts, as President of the Ameri-
can Society of Electrical Engineers, as well as the
recognized head of research in the Laboratories of
the General Electric, he exercised a dynamic influ-
ence in the movement for scientific research to
which Pupin and Lamme had also made such sig-
nificant contributions.
Elbert Hubbard said of him, "So let Steinmetz
stand as a type of modern engineer who is not only
an engineer, but is an artist, an economist, a teacher.
a humanist."

architecture crept into America, sponsored by H.
H. Richardson, the most prominent architect at that
time. Mum ford gives a brief sketch of Richard-
son's life, stating his reasons for introducing such
an ancient style. This style, the writer points out,
was entirely out of keeping with the progress in in-
dustrialism then coming to life.
It was also during Richardson's time that Amer-
ica was showing the world many new feats with
the use of steel. Nevertheless, so called art asso-
ciations, thinking to aspire to new heights, persisted
in adopting the architecture of the old world for
public buildings and memorials. These styles could
only be used for facades, the rest of the building
being primarily for utilitarian purposes demanding
much interior space.
Lewis Mumford carries on to the machine age,
which entirely changed the style of architecture,
and started that which today is termed modern
architecture. It was this change he points out that
completely blotted out the use of classical and
medieval architecture in this country, and created
a style purely American embodying American
ideals.
With this chapter in American architectural his-
tory and resulting civilization, Lewis Mumford
concludes his book, and, appropriate enough is this
conclusion which contains our desires, aims, habits,
and ends.

How dii Pont Explosives helped to build the
LARGEST EARTH DAM IN THE WORLD
THE gigantic barrier, built on the Saluda River
near Columbia, South Carolina, is capable of
backing up 750 billion gallons of water for hydro-
electric power. Eleven million cubic yards of earth
were poured into the dam to make this possible.
In building this great dam, the first task was to
construct three miles of railroad to the site. Next
came excavation for the penstocks. Thirty-three
thousand yards of rock had to be removed. Here,
particularly, explosives proved invaluable. Du Pont
Explosives were on the job.
This is but one of hundreds of great engineering
marvels that are made possible through DYNAMITE.
The engineer of tomorrow needs to know all there
is to know about dynamite . . . the tool that helps
to build skyscrapers, bridges, dams, subways, tun-
nels, roads and railroads.
How can you know more . . . now . . . while you're
still in college? Write the du Pont Company for
a copy of The Blasters'1 Handbook. This book con-
tains a wealth of information about explosives . . . in-
formation gathered in one hundred and twenty-eight
years'experience in making and improving explosives.

KOEHRING AUTOCYCLE PAVER
A PIONEER and a leader among pavers, the
Koehring leads in basic developments—the
latest of which is the Koehring autocycle.
Just as Koehring developed the boom and
bucket, batchmeter, and the five action re-
mixing principle—Koehring developed the auto-
cycle, a principle for automatically controlling
the cycle of charging, mixing and discharging,
creating entirely new standards of efficiency in
paver operation.
The Koehring autocycle is a means of providing
a fast, exact automatic sequence of batchmeter-
timed operations. It makes the most of every
minute and provides an ample factor of safety.
Time is saved at both ends of the cycle, in charg-
ing the materials and in discharging and placing
the concrete, resulting in increased output per
day.
The concrete roadbuilding industry has experi-
enced ;:he importance of this principle—the
Koehring autocycle of charging, mixing, dis-
charging. The industry knows the Koehring is
more than merely a paver—that it is a plus
service rendered, that it sets the pace on a con-
crete paving project, that it produces standard-
ized dominant strength concrete of unvarying
uniformity!

Research for a Science of
Foundations
By WILLIAM S. HOUSEL, Asst. Professor of Civil Engineering
THE science of foundations refers to a partic-
ular field of knowledge which comes within
the province of the civil engineer. While the
term implies that the solution of foundation prob-
lems is accomplished on a basis which justifies
being called a science, a review of actual practice
in this field reveals it to be the least scientific of
any part of modern engineering practice.
The fundamental importance of building upon an
adequate foundation has always been given the
emphasis that it __^^^^_==___^^___^_^^
deserves, in fact
the necessity of
so doing has be-
come such an
important axiom
that it is used as
an analogy in
many lines of
human endeavor.
It is perhaps dif-
ficult to under-
stand h o w in
spite of its ad-
mitted i m p o r-
tance, the actual
science of foun-
dations has
lagged so far be-
hind other fields

of highly developed present day engineering.
Being perhaps the first problem which occupied
the minds of builders of ancient times, some basis
of determination of the adequacy of foundations
was early established. That this basis of determi-
nation was merely a cut and try process, to build
in accordance with that which had been built, is
the natural consequence of an almost total lack of
knowledge of strength of materials. Failure on
"the part of modern builders to realize the possibili-
ties for improvement and the resulting economy
has allowed methods, established in the ci ,~ of
building construction, to remain with very few es-
sential changes to govern practice in this important
branch of modern building construction.
As a matter of fact by far the greater number of
foundation problems are decided only on the basis
of that which has been done, and there is in general
use no entirely logical method of determining when
a foundation is sufficient and no basis for measuring
its sufficiency in accordance with accepted stand-
ards. In recent years there have been numerous
__ attempts to de-
~~ velop some part
of a science of
foundations, but
the sum total of
these efforts
does not at the
present time
sketch more than
a very vague
outline of what
may eventually
deserve the title
of a science.
It is the pur-
pose of this pa-
per to relate one
more attempt to
supply some part
of the knowledge
necessary to build a science of foundations and to
summarize the results of this investigation up to
the present time.
Early in 1927, the opportunity arose for the Uni-
versity of Michigan to cooperate with a number of
large engineering organizations in Detroit, Michi-
gan in launching a research program in bearing
capacity of soils. The investigation was to be
carried on in connection with a number of important
structures which were to be built over a period of
several years. The foundation conditions were in
several cases quite critical and the designers of

these structures were entirely dissatisfied with the
necessity of designing substructures with no other
criterion of adequacy than a rough comparison with
other structures built under conditions which
seemed similar.
A careful study of existing practice in foundation
engineering revealed that there were a number of
conflicting ideas regarding the fundamental princi-
ples involved in problems of this sort, and very
few of them generally accepted as being sound.
The development in recent years has in some cases,
led to a complete reversal of former opinion as in
the following example: A cyclopedia of Civil En-
gineering published in 1908 states, "the larger the
area of the foundation, the
greater will be the load per
square foot which may be
safely carried." While
more recent evidence
shows quite conclusively
that the bearing capacity
or load per square foot
which may be safely car-
ried on an earth foundation
decreases as the size of the
bearing area increases.
In the more recent years
a great deal of effort has
been put forth by the
engineering profession to
attempt to develop satis-
factory methods of deter-
mining bearing capacity of
soils. That these attempts
have not led to more posi-
tive results was a matter
which deserved particular
attention especially when a
further attempt was about
to be launched. A review
of other investigations
which had been made, led
to the conclusion that the
failure to produce more
positive results was due either to a failure to obtain
the right kind of test data or a failure to obtain
data of sufficient volume to be the basis for estab-
lishing general principles.
At the outset of the present investigation it was
considered important in the first place to collect
the necessary data in the field under actual soil
conditions to which structures are subjected. In
the second place, inasmuch as the problem could
not be brought into the laboratory it was considered
important to spare no efforts in achieving labora-
tory accuracy in the field. Last but not least, the
investigation contemplated the collection of a suf-
ficiently large volume of such data, the cost being

relegated to a position of secondary importance.
The problem was divided into three major parts.
First, it was necessary to isolate those properties
which control the bearing capacity of a material
and systematically determine their relative impor-
tance; second, it was necessary to develop a more
general theory by which the properties of a material
could be expressed and used as a means of rating
the carrying capacity of the material according to
standards which would be accepted. Third, it was
important to develop methods by which these prop-
erties could be measured readily and with reason-
able economy.
It has been generally recognized that there must
be some properties of the
soil which control its car-
ry capacity, but there has
been heretofore no accept-
ed theory for expressing
this variation. More than
that there has been no
agreement as to what these
important properties are
and obviously then, no
methods by which these
unknowns could be meas-
ured. The development in
this field has been directed
toward cataloguing the va-
rious and sundry character-
istics of a material and
classifying an almost in-
finite number of types of
soil which are encountered.
The procedure has then
been to attempt to express
the characteristics of this
extremely variable material
in terms of an ideal mate-
rial to which existing
strength theories were ap-
plicable. Hopeless as this
method has always been
there seems to be tremen-
dous inertia which must be overcome before engi-
neers become willing to avoid those theories whose
very limitations make them wholly inadequate.- It
is not intended to create the impression that the
older strength theories are in error, but merely that
they are only correctly used in the case of a few
materials which do not depart far from the assumed
ideal material. Such theories are certainly inade-
quate and a more satisfactory one can only be
developed when strength characteristics of mate-
rials are dealt with on a more general basis.
It seemed quite necessary to eliminate the large
number of factors which did not lead to definite con-
clusions and consider only the essential ones. Color,

chemical composition, water content, and a number
of other soil characteristics, while they may affect
bearing capacity seemed to be of no direct help to
the foundation engineer in his problem of determin-
ing how many pounds per square foot a certain soil
will safely carry. Briefly, any immediate success
in the solution of this problem seemed very largely
dependent upon separating it from the controversial
field of soil physics at least temporarily and post-
poning a consideration of the many detailed char-
acteristics which have no direct bearing on the
problem.
The methods pursued during the investigation
have of necessity been the reverse of the logical
process outlined in the first statement of the prob-
lem which was one of determination of responsible
factors, the development of correlating theory, and
finally, the development of methods of measure-
ment. The program has rather been carried out
by first making a large number of tests with only
a general idea of what the responsible factors were,
setting up a number of reasonable theories as a
working basis, and finally analyzing the data in the
light of these working theories to determine the
responsible factors.
There has been in all more than 200 load tests
conducted with a 60-ton capacity testing machine,
any one test requiring from one to seven days to
complete, and costing from fifty to five hundred
dollars. The analysis of this large volume of data
has been carried on at the University of Michigan
and the results of the investigation are being passed
pended in the present investigation. While by far
the major portion of this expenditure is very prop-
erly a direct engineering expense against structures

on to the engineering profession as rapidly as pos-
sible. This work has been done in connection with
engineering structures, as only by combining
research work with actual construction can the
necessary data be obtained, due to the consider-
able cost of the tests which must be performed.

that have been built, the data collected are no less
valuable than if the work had been done for no
other motive than to obtain desired information for
developing the science of foundations. At the same
time, the savings which have been effected by the
research program are considerably in excess of the
total expense, to say nothing of the value of this
work to future building.
While it is not the intention of the present dis-
cussion to go into the technical details of the
investigation, a general summary of results seems
entirely within its scope. The analysis of results
indicates that the ability of any material to resist
deformation under load may be expressed in terms
of two stress reactions which are developed by the
material. These two stress reactions may be
designated as resistance to compression or volume
change, and resistance to shearing stress or resist-
ance to change in shape. These stress reactions
may be expressed quantitatively by two coefficients
which are determined by actual load tests of the
material in question.
One coefficient is known as the coefficient of set-
tlement and is directly proportional to the coeffi-
cient of compressibility of the material. The other
coefficient is known as the stress-reaction coefficient
and is the measure of the relative importance of the
two separate stress reactions which have been cited.
A general equation has been developed which gives
the relation between settlement, bearing capacity,
and size of bearing area in terms of the two funda-
mental physical characteristics of the material.
Considerable attention has been directed toward
working out the connection between the general

The New Dreadnaught of the Air
By EMIL T. P. NEUBAUER, '3IE
DOWN in Akron, Ohio, a great structure is
nearing completion. When completed, the
capability of this masterpiece of engineering
ingenuity will by far surpass anything yet known
in the world today, and, in all reality, is the fulfill-
ment to the dreams of many great men. This
masterpiece is the new Navy dirigible "Akron",
and is the result of the efforts of many noted men,
who have ^_^^______^^_^^_^^^^^^^^
worked tire- ~
lessly in the
face of many
troubles and
difficulties. The
first practical
proof of lighter-
than-air travel
came in the
18th century by
the now fa-
mous Montgol-
fier, which was
his remarkable
free balloon
demonstration.
The first bal-
loon to be di-
rected through
the air came
about 60 years
later by Gif-
fard; this was
but a very hum-
ble beginning
as is true in all
engineering developments. Montgolfier and Gif-
fard were both well known French aviation en-
thusiasts, and inventors. All during the 19th
century no particularly great advances were made
in lighter-than-air navigation, until the very last
years of this period. The 20th century has seen
the entire development except the original inven-
tion. This is of course true in most all other lines
of engineering development.
The one name which ranks highest in connection
with the development of rigid lighter-than-air craft
is that of Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin. His ideas
gave birth to features never before used on any
type of airship, and they have made possible the
modern rigid ships of great size, reliability and
safety. To have a ship propelled by motors was
not the Count's original idea or invention but his
invention is the triple layer principle. The triple
layer principle is: (1) a rigid metal framework to
withstand the major stresses from the loads carried,
lifting gas forces, dynamic and aerodynamic forces;
(2) gas cells within to retain the lifting gas; and
(3) a taut fabric outer cover, doped and metalized, waterproofing
it, protecting it
against the ele-
ments, reflect-
ing rather than
absorbing heat,
and offering a
smooth flying
surface.
Count Zeppe-
lin's ideas of
airships un-
doubtedly were
due to his love
of adventure.
During the Civil
War he left his
native country
to serve with
the Union army
as a military
observer, and in
this service he
had the oppor-
tunity to see
free and captive
balloons in ac-
tual use and also to make several ascensions. From
then on the adventure and desire to travel in the
air remained firmly in his heart, thus causing the
birth of the idea of rigid lighter-than-air craft. Due
to the Count's tireless efforts he finally received
enough backing to build his first Zeppelin. The
first Zeppelin proved to be a failure after a few
trial flights but proved to be valuable and useful
for the information and experience it gave to the
aged inventor. Three more ships were built and
met disaster but from the fifth ship on, success
crowned the efforts of the workers. Passenger lines
were soon organized and five ships were put into
service. During this period the airship industry
also started in America by the Goodyear Tire and

Rubber Company. The early passenger ships first
built by Count Zeppelin were successful in their
application but, compared to the ships of later date
they were crude in design and structure. The
World War was the one great factor which caused
rapid advances in the design and development of
the airship. During the war 88 Zeppelins were
built, and all were flown with the highly inflam-
mable hydrogen gas which made the ship an easy
mark for an incendiary bullet.
Since the year 1911, the Goodyear Tire and Rub-
ber Company has pioneered the technical develop-
ment of the lighter-than-air craft in this country.
This corporation has not built a large number of
rigid airships, but has carried on many experiments
for particular development and has built many free
balloons and blimps. The war time saw this com-
pany the builders of the largest number of balloons
and about 100 non-rigid airships. In the year of
1924, when the "Los Angeles" was flown from Ger-
many to the United States, the Goodyear Company
brought the Zeppelin rights and patents to this
country. The German experience and knowledge
added to the Goodyear lighter-than-air business
built a firm foundation for this type of aircraft
construction in the United States, and with this
combination, the corporation is fully justified in
tackling the problems necessary in building the
world's largest airship.
Dr. Karl Arnstein, the designer of the "Akron",
was formerly the Chief Engineer of the Luftschiff-
bau-Zeppelin and has designed some 70 successful
dirigibles. The need of large rigid airships
for the Navy Department was foreseen, and after

the organization of the American Zeppelin Com-
pany, named the Goodyear Zeppelin Corporation,
Dr. Arnstein and his staff of technical experts took
up the study of conditions in America regarding
matters of material, supply, helium, hangars, and
operating bases. He then designed the ZRS-4, later
named the "Akron", and a modern hangar for the
building of this ship. When the contract wasi
awarded by the Navy Department, the Goodyear

Zeppelin Corporation was prepared to start imme-
diate erection of the hangar and the building of the
airships. The contract calls for two ships of the
same type.
Before going into the details of the ship let us
take a glance at the hanger in which the ship is
being built. The new hangar at Akron, Ohio, is
the largest and most unusual building in all the
world. The structure is 1,175 feet long, 325 feet
wide, and 211 feet high, with no interior supports.
This floor space is large enough to permit ten foot-
ball games to be played simultaneously. In fact it
is so large that when inside of the building all sense
of proportion is lost; everything appears much
smaller than the actual size. The large beams, sup-
porting this structure, appear to be merely steel
bands rising from the floor, and the men working
on the ship appear to be midgets entangled in a
great net. The Washington Monument and the
Woolworth building could be laid down inside this
structure with room to spare.
The queer shape of the hangar is due to wind
interference problems. To get away from cross
wind disturbances as much as possible, when a ship
is taken in or out of the dock, Dr. Arnstein and his
staff developed the basic design in fixing the shape
of the building, approximately a semi-parabolic.
The orange-peel-shaped doors weigh 600 tons each,
of which there are four. These doors are pin con-
nected at the top and run on a circular track at
the bottom. They are opened and closed by elec-
tric motors. Another difficult problem, that had to

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The Law on Municipal Corporations
Bv WAI.TKII C. SADLEH, Associate Professor of Civil Engineering
THE law on Municipal Corporations offers a
rather interesting study and warrants a close
investigation into the legal rights and obliga-
tions of the modern American city. It is often a
subject of most vital importance to Engineers, Con-
tractors, and Bonding Houses. Because of its long
historical development and its many ramifications
through statutory provisions, only a general outline
may be presented in a paper of this length. There
are, however, some basic principles which can be
clearly established.
Powers, Sovereign and Derivative
Power, as viewed from the legal concept of
authority to act, may be classified according to the
source of the power. Thus a state has sovereign
power—power which is accepted as having belonged
to a state from time immemorial, since the time
"when the memory of man runneth not to the con-
trary." This sovereign power of the state is the
only foundation upon which a permanent govern-
ment may be built. It is true that the power of the
state may be restricted in certain fields, as where it
delegates to a central federated government the
authority to regulate commerce, or again where
the state restricts itself in a state constitution,
agreeing with the people of the state that it will
not take private property for public use without
just compensation. But it is axiomatic to under-
stand that the sovereign power of the state is ba-
sically supreme.
Contrasted with this sovereign power of the state,
is a delegated one called derivative pou'cr. This de-
rivative power can be no greater than the terms of
the delegation. An example of this type of power
occurs with a properly incorporated concern. The
terms of the delegation are found in the corpora-
tion's charter and in the appropriate statutes. These
terms constitute the source of the corporation's
power; establishing its extent and limitations. A
municipal corporation is a special type of corpora-
tion, with rules peculiar to its needs.
The city organization of a century ago was ef-
fected in order to better provide for the general
welfare and safety of the people, and the authority
granted by the state to the city was restricted to
such appropriate powers. With the passage of
years, the United States has greatly increased in
population, particularly in the large cities. Hence,
the city problems have become more complex, with
its taxes, advanced educational activities, lights,
water, sewers, and public improvements. Further-
more, the state has found it expedient to secure
assistance from the city in the matter of having
city officials collect state taxes; conduct of state
elections by city officials, etc.
General Activities
It is clear that the taxing power of the city must
be restricted to the territory within the city limits.
If it is desired to extend the territorial limits for
the purposes of taxation, a new corporation is set
up embracing this territory with proper authority
delegated by the legislature. Situations like this
have developed in the promotion of big port con-
struction programs, as in Mobile, Alabama, and
Seattle, Washington. But the municipality itself
could not go beyond its city limits in assessing
taxes. A contrary result is secured, however, where
the city wishes to go beyond its city limits in the
exercise of its normal activities. Thus a city may
erect a city reservoir, outfall sewer, pest house, or
cemetery beyond its city limits. It can even regu-
late indirectly beyond the city limits in the matter
of sanitation, as where it forbids untested milk to
be brought within the city limits.
The normal acts of its city council are not subject
to "notice and hearing," the activities being purely
of a legislative nature. Thus, where an ordinance
approving the construction of a new sewer is
enacted, the municipal corporation (through its
council) has authorized the work, and an individual
taxpayer cannot bring an injunction raising the
issue of the desirability or good judgment involved.
Of course, if the taxpayer can establish that the
entire proceeding is unreasonable, as being out and
beyond all limits of good engineering practice, his
prayer for injunctive relief is proper.
Some very close cases are presented where a city
enters into a contract for the purchase of equipment
or material and supplies without proper legislative
authority. The law in various jurisdictions appears
somewhat in conflict, although often the apparently
conflicting decisions can be reconciled by the careful
examination of the wording of the respective stat-
utes. Thus, if the statute requires that the city
appropriate the money before making the purchase,
some courts hold that this is purely a "directory
law" and that the violation of the law or the failure
to so appropriate the funds before the goods are

What Shall I Read?
The Adams Family
By J. RALEIGH NELSON, Professor of English
THE Adams Family by James Truslow Adams
introduces the reader to America's most dis-
tinguished family and at the same time af-
fords a review of American history from the Revo-
lution to 1927 in one brilliant volume of absorbing
interest. Viewed even statistically the Adams fam-
ily may well claim to have made a contribution to
the development of American institutions which
is without parallel in the history of any people.
Two presidents, one vice-presi-
dent, one secretary of state, one
secretary of the navy, three min-
isters to England, two to Hol-
land, one each to France, Russia,
Portugal, Germany, four mem-
bers of Congress, besides schol-
ars, philosophers, critics,—it is a
notable record, the more remark-
able because in the entire line
there has not been a single poli-
tician: whenever the members
of this family have been in-
volved in affairs of state, they
have all been high-minded, dis-
interested statesmen.
John Adams, himself in the
fifth generation of native born
New Englanders, was a member
of the First Continental Con-
gress, where among other things
he nominated General Washing-
ton to the command of the con-
tinental armies; he served on the
committee for the establishment
of the American navy; he shared
with Jefferson the honor of having drafted the
Declaration of Independence which his eloquence
forced through Congress; he was one of the Com-
mittee which drafted the Constitution. In 1778 he
served with Benjamin Franklin as Commissioner to
France, where his independence of judgment made
him less popular but more effective than the philo-
sophical Franklin. He won recognition of the
United States from Holland and was appointed
duly accredited Minister to that country. He was
largely influential in effecting the preliminary treaty
PROF. J. RALEIGH NELSON
with Great Britain, and in negotiating the commer-
cial treaty in which, to be sure, he shared his re-
sponsibilities with Franklin and Jay. He was the
hrst Minister to England, the first Vice President,
serving two terms with Washington, and finally the
second President of the United States. Perhaps
one of the most important acts of his entire life
was the last official act before he retired from the
Presidency to private life,—the appointment of John
Marshall as Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court. John Adams
stands with Washington and
Jefferson as one of the three
great constructive influences
that shaped and determined the
American Constitution.
John Adams' son, John
Quincy, who had served as his
father's secretary when he was
Minister to England, was him-
self appointed Minister to the
Hague when he was but twenty-
seven years of age. He was
later Minister Plenipotentiary to
Prussia, where he negotiated the
treaties with Sweden. After his
recall by his President father he
was elected to the State Senate
and later to the Senate of the
United States. He was appoint-
ed by President Madison, Minis-
ter to Russia, a post he held till,
in 1811, he was appointed on the
Peace Commission to negotiate
peace with England. He was
the first Minister to England following the renewal
of diplomatic relations following the \Var of 1812.
As Secretary of State under Monroe, he succeeded
in limiting the claims of Russia to our Northwest
territories; he formulated the so-called Monroe
Doctrine, which has become one of the abiding prin-
ciples of international law; and he won Florida from
Spain. For these and numerous other distinguished
services he may fairly be reckoned as the greatest
of all our secretaries of state. His presidency was
marked by the same magnificent statesmanship, but

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Paging the "Social Engineer
lly ARTHUR EVANS WOOD, Professor of Sociology
THE engineer has always played the leading
role in material progress. The primitive man
who discovered the method of making fire,
and the woman who invented the hoe, were engi-
neers. From those remote times to the present day
of inconceivably complex machines the engineering
function has been the foundation of technical de-
velopment. Perhaps most of the patient heroes of
invention are unknown to us; and it would be ap-
propriate to build a shrine to the
memory of the "unknown" engi-
neer.
On the other hand, the role
of the social engineer is compar-
atively recent. He works with
problems of human adjustment,
rather than with the manipula-
tion of material things. It is a
new idea that society itself is
amenable to a scientific tech-
nique. Of course, it involves a
new factor—the human element.
But knowledge and skill are of
even greater importance here,
because a serious blunder may
be difficult to remedy. If, as in
the case of the Ambassador
Bridge, a cable is found to be
too weak, another can be readily
produced. If, on the other hand,
a botch is made of race relation-
ships, or of international affairs, friction and war
may ensue. The social engineer needs a knowledge
of human nature, of social conditions, and of what
can be done to improve them. Such knowledge
cannot be learned from a laboratory within four
walls; it can be acquired, if at all, only by sympa-
thetic insight into the broad movements of human
society. The mechanism of society is psychic, not
material. It requires a more delicate handling. An
engineering friend of mine once suggested that we
solve the problem of immigration by taking immi-
grants when they land, and forcing them to go to
places that we select for them. It is obvious that
he was applying his material technique to the ad-
justment of humans. It won't work. The colon-
ization of immigrants is a problem of human engi-
neering, and many an effort in this direction has
failed, because the fundamental human factors were
ignored.
THE Editorial Board will
present in coming issues
special problems of the
Engineer as seen by persons
outside of the Engineering
Profession. This Article, by
Professor Arthur E. Wood, is
the first of this series.
Professor Wood came to the
University of Michigan 13
years ago from the University
of Pennsylvania where he ob-
tained his Doctor's Degree in
Sociology. He has been a
teacher for the past twenty
years, and has written a num-
ber of books on Community
Problems. He is at present,
along with his work at the
University, engaged with Pres-
ident Hoover's Housing Com-
mittee.
Before we elaborate further these requisite quali-
ties of social engineering, let us turn to some of the
fields where it applies. We learned something about
the matter during the War. One recalls that at
that time out in the forests of the northwest much
trouble was being caused by the radicals, especially
by the I. W. W. It happened that Colonel Bisque,
who was then Warden of Jackson prison, was sent
out to the lumber camps to take charge of matters.
In a short while, through his
qualities of leadership, he had
the trouble-makers working en-
thusiastically for the Govern-
ment. Let me repeat, it was not
done by terrorism, but by gain-
ing the confidence of the men.
It was a pity to take such a man
from his work in the prison, but
his greater value just then was
elsewhere. All this reminds us
that human engineering has per-
haps its greatest scope in labor
relationships. No wise engineer
would have introduced the
"stretching" system that has de-
moralized the labor conditions in
the southern cotton mills. In
general, I think that real prog-
ress has been made by engineers
in their plans relative to factory
production, because they have
begun to estimate the possible human results in
fatigue and discontent. But they still have a long
way to go if happiness, and not merely productivity,
is to be taken into account.
Just here let us consider another aspect of labor
relationships with which the engineers have had
much to do. It is the engineers who have built
the machines that have produced our so-called tech-
nological unemployment. We are passing through
a chaotic period with still 45,000 families being fed
by the bounty of the city of Detroit. Is it not
reasonable to expect that they who are responsible
for our machines shall begin to give some thought
to the human consequences of their work? Or shall
we rely on the politicians, or radicals, or even ''let
George do it"? This last is the grand, old American
way, but can it continue? Of course, I am not argu-
ing that engineers have wilfully caused widespread

With the Signal Corps at
Fort Sheridan
By DONALD IV. SCOFIELD, '3IE
-C'T T"r"ITH high spirits in anticipation of six
\\/ weeks of fun and work in the open, uni-
VV versity men from Ohio State, Illinois,
Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan entered the
military post at Fort Sheridan, Illinois, last June,
for the annual summer training period of the ad-
vanced course of the R.O.T.C. Most of them drove
cars to the camp and what a time some of them had
before they finally reached ^^_^^^^^^^^
camp! It was only by sheer ten-"
acity of purpose that some of
the parties arrived at all. One
group in particular, I believe,
had to get out and carry their
poor old Ford car into camp and
spent the spare time at camp
nursing it back to health in the
hope that it might get them back
home again. There was a great
deal of confusion the first day
getting acquainted, relating ex-
periences while on the way, and
getting settled for camp life.
The first day at such a camp
is spent in giving the necessary
physical examinations and is-
suing the equipment. This is
called processing and is carried
out in a very efficient and im-
personal way as might be gath-
ered perhaps from reading
"Out Our Way". The victim
first is relieved of his clothing
and then proceeds down a long
room and receives a thorough
physical examination and if he
survives this, he is issued
enough of the regulation "rookie" outfit to last the
six weeks of camp.
The lodgings were the regulation tent, four or
five men to the tent, and assigned in alphabetical
order, thus avoiding any conflicts, feuds, discrimi-
nations or other troubles which might occur if the
arrangements were made in some other fashion.
There was plenty of fresh air on hot nights and the
tents stood up reasonably well in rainy weather.
The meals were served in mess halls at one end of
the company streets and were very satisfactory.
Activities began at the sound of reveille, 5:45
A.M. This sounds pretty early to most of us but

it's certain one cannot enjoy sleep any longer after
having experienced the rude awakening as executed
by a hard hearted first sergeant. Just to jerk any
sleep that may still be lurking in your eyes, a brisk
fifteen minutes of "setting up" exercises under the
close scrutiny of all the officers in camp seems to be
good practice. The company streets must be
cleaned and raked before breakfast at 6:45. When
the company marches out of
the street at 7:30 for a full
morning's work the tents must
be in order for the morning in-
spection. Dinner was at noon,
then classes or other work be-
gan at 1 :00 P.M., standing re-

the day. The only variations
from this schedule were the
Wednesday and Saturday aft-
ernoons off and of course there
was nothing to do on Sunday.
There are so many diver-
sions to enjoy at camp that no
one need spend an idle minute.
There was always the oppor-
tunity to go swimming and
also tennis courts were avail-
able. Almost every night there
was a volley ball game in the
company street. The post
movie theater offered the latest
"talkies" with a new show
every night. For those with
special ability there was gen-
erally a poker game going on.
Once a week the camp sing was held and all the
favorite college songs were rendered with great
gusto as well as some harmony. The weekends
offered a fine opportunity to visit Chicago and see
the sights. One is well repaid for the trip just
to go through the Field Museum which is only one
of the hundreds of worth while things that can be
seen. By far the most important feature as far as
diversions are concerned are the dances held each
Tuesday night for the R.O.T.C. men. The young
ladies imported for the occasions came from Evans-
ton and Lake Forest. From all this it can be seen

The New Inter-Oceanic Canal
Although the army engineers are only preparing
a report on the feasibility of the Nicaraguanian
Canal, it would seem wise to look at some of the
more outstanding facts regarding the situation. In
1928 the traffic of the present Panama Canal reached
its highest point which was only 50% of its total
capacity. This total would not have been so great,
had not a large portion of the traffic been from
the ships carrying oil from the California fields to
the Eastern refineries. The traffic through the
Canal might have increased slightly in the follow-
ing years, but with the present state of business
stagnation it would appear that it will be many
years before the traffic will again reach the high
mark of 1928. The Government has, however, ex-
ercised a considerable foresight in increasing the
ultimate capacity of the Canal above its present
capacity by the construction of the Madden reser-
voir and a third set of locks. When this work is
completed it will raise the capacity of the Canal
about four times. It would then seem that a second
canal would only reduce the traffic in the present
canal and neither project would be anywhere near
self-supporting.
Ol' Man Depression
With the completion of another school year in
the immediate offing, the undergraduate scans the
industrial and business horizon and finds conditions
getting no better fast. Ol' Man Depression still
reigns supreme and his rule seems to be even more
firmly situated than ever before.
To the graduate of 1931 the outlook must appear
bleak and desolate. Positions are well nigh impos-
sible to procure. Those that are available are not
very enticing. All in all, it seems to be dishearten-
ing in every way. But to one who takes the trouble
to look below the surface there is an undeniable
challenge.
All things grow to more magnificent heights from
their ashes. This is indisputable and applies to


Page Fifteen
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the whole gamut of human relationships from em-
pires and cities to big business and small enter-
prises. That the business world today figuratively
stands in its own ashes is almost true. The large
corporations are working at 50% or 60% of their
capacity at the very best and many of the smaller
business ventures have been forced to close their
doors. When the awakening comes and the pulse
of industry quickens, the intricate and complicated
structure of gigantic business will have to be re-
built. That the results of the rebuilding should be
better beyond measure than the pre-depression sys-
tem goes without saying. The man who materially
aids in this reconstruction will find that he has laid
an unshakable corner stone for his career and has
successfully answered the challenge flung down by
Ol' Man Depression.
So to the graduate of '31 we bid God-speed; and
we stand fast in the faith that he will take full
advantage of the wonderful possibilities offered him
in these trying times. S. C. K.

Meteorology Course
The departments of aeronautical engineering and
geology recently offered a two-weeks' course in
meteorology to those interested in aviation and as-
sociated sciences. The guest instructor, one of the
most eminent meteorologists in the country, was
Professor S. P. Ferguson of the United States
Weather Bureau, and aerologist on all University
geological expeditions. The course, consisting of
a series of six lectures which treated all angles of
the study and exploration of the atmosphere from
the standpoint of weather characteristics, was quite
a success in the opinion of those who attended. It
is to be desired that more opportunities such as
this one will be available to the students in the
future, and that the students rise to the full realiza-
tion of the benefits to be derived from them.

Parking on East University Street
It would seem that when Dean Sadler had the
"no parking" places established and marked in front
of the Engineering Buildings on East University,
that the people would try to park outside these
zones. This appears, however, to have little weight
with some people. On rainy days when students
are hurrying from one Engineering Building to
another, they always find that they have to dodge
between parked cars for all crossings are blocked.
The rate at which cars travel along East University
makes crossing very dangerous when students have
to dodge between parked automobiles before they
can see traffic in both directions. It is disagreeable
to solicit the aid of the police department in placing
red tags on these cars when a little care on the
part of operators would rectify the whole situation-
Oil Banquet
The Annual Sigma Rho Tau Tung Oil Banquet
will be held at the Michigan Union on May twenty-
seventh. Sigma Rho Tau will honor the outstand-
ing debaters and stump speakers of the past year
and Dean Cooley will present the famous Cooley
Cane to the outstanding Senior Engineer. A
speaker of National fame has been obtained
through the efforts of the allied Technical Society
of Detroit. A complete program has been planned
for the entertainment of the entire Engineering and
Architectural College.
Don't miss the outstanding Engineering Banquet
of the year!
Testing Sound Effects
Radio microphones and an echoing room give
more accurate results in testing the loudness of
sounds than does a room heavily padded in an at-
tempt to smother all but the original source of
sound, University of Michigan physicists working
under the direction of Professor F. A. Firestone
have proved.
The University of Michigan sound room is lo-
cated three stories underground beneath the East
Physics building. Standing on its own foundation,
and with an air space at the sides and top, the
room is in fact an independent small building
buried within a larger one, and unaffected in any
appreciable degree by sound vibrations from out-
side sources.
Within, the chamber is finished with hard plaster
walls, and being a cube in shape, free from any
projections, it encourages rather than prevents
echos and reverberations of any sound within it.
To add to the apparent confusion of echos there
is suspended from the ceiling a two bladecl fan of
large area which revolves slowly and continually
breaks up the reverberating sound waves from the
walls into smaller and mixed echos.
Attached to each blade of this fan is a micro-
phone which whirls through the room picking up
the sound at different points and conveying it out-
side to a series of amplifying tubes, meters and a
device for tuning in whatever pitches of the total
sound are desired. This method of sound testing
allows accurate determination of the whole amount
of sound and is superior for purposes of sound in-
tensity measurement to methods carried out in a
padded room, since the walls of the latter at best
never absorb even half the sound waves and allow
a certain amount of reflected sounds to interfere
with the direct sound from the source. In the
Michigan room, however, though a word can be
heard for fifteen seconds, and is reflected back and
forth for a distance of three miles, the apparent
jumble of sound can be accurately ordered and
measured by the radio devices.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
COLLEGE NOTES
Professor C. T. Johnston
A Michigan alumnus, graduating in 1895, Pro-
fessor Clarence T. Johnston went to Wyoming
from here to become engaged in irrigation, reser-
voir, and canal work. At the same time he was
Assistant State Engineer in charge of all stream
measurements, and he also managed to sandwich in
a year of gold placer mining at Northwestern, Colo-
rado. Thus briskly started out in his chosen field,
he returned here to receive the degree of Civil En-
gineer in 1899, and then joined the irrigation inves-
tigations bureau of the De-
partment of Agriculture. =
The East next raised a
beckoning finger, so the Pro-
fessor went to Egypt during
the years 1901-02 to study ir-
rigation administration and
the construction of diversion
works. He also found time
to travel in northern Italy,
southern France and Spain.
In 1903 he was appointed
State Engineer of Wyoming,
which position he held until
he was called to the Univer-
sity of Michigan in 1911.
During this residence in
Wyoming, Professor Johnston
spent as much time as he
could vacationing in the
famed Jackson Hole country
where the University now
holds its surveying camp.
Traveled though he is, Pro-
fessor Johnston still describes
this territory as the most pic-
turesque that he has seen any-
where, and it was through
him that the University made contacts for securing
the camp.
Here at Michigan Professor Johnston's adminis-
trative work has been of exceptional nature. He
was one of the prime factors in the organization of
the mentor system at the time of its inception, and
was chairman of the first Discipline Committee,
not only in the College, but in the University. Fur-
ther, he has been in charge of the summer survey-
ing camp since 1911 and under his guidance was
built the camp on Douglas Lake, which has since
been turned over to the biological station, and the
present Camp Davis in Wyoming.
A member of Acacia fraternity, he has been on
two of the chapter's building committees, and for
the past eight years has been
= a member of the Board in
Control of Athletics. Pro-
fessor Johnston is also a
member of several honor so-
cieties, among them Sigma
Xi and Tau Beta Pi. He is
a fellow of the American As-
sociation for the Advance-
ment of Science, and a mem-
ber of the Geophysical Un-
ion, an international organi-
zation supported in this coun-
try by the National Research
Council. And in the past six
years his membership in the
American Society of Civil
Engineers has placed him on
special committees for the or-
ganization of the study of
geodesy and surveying.
Two sons are graduates of
the College of Engineering,
one an electrical engineer and
the other a mechanical. o

The Slide Rule Dance
Even more successful than
its predecessor was the second annual Slide Rule
Dance, held at the Michigan Union on March 27th.
This affair, which is the high spot on the engineer's
social calendar, more than fulfilled every promise
of the publicity committee. Ace Brigode and his

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Fourteen Virginians reached new heights in ren-
dering the popular airs of the hour, and won great
applause from even the most seasoned dance-goers.
The nuclei of the decorations were the Seal of
the Colleges of Engineering and Architecture, and
the mammoth slide rule which has led such a check-
ered career. Reputed to
have once been captured
by the lawyers, the slide
rule was recovered and
fears were subsequently
entertained for its safe-
ty. However, the rival
college held its Crease
Dance the same night
and the traditional tom-
foolery was again con-
spicuous by its absence.
Favors for the dances
consisted of miniature
slide rules. Although
no match for the mighty
log-log polyphase instru-
ments, they made sitting
out a highly exciting
pastime. The inevitable
statisticians were around
to report that at the end
of the evening some two
hundred fair coeds could
multiply 2 by 2 and get
4 (±3.5). But then is
it fair to ask such charm-
ing creatures to master
our manly arts?
The Grand March was
led by Miss Dorothy
Norris, '33, of Ann Ar-
bor, and her escort, Ben
Lansdale, '31E, general
chairman for the dance.
We remember that Miss
Norris was very attrac-
tively gowned, but as
for details—well, that's
what we get for being
masculine and an engi-
neer.
Other committee chair-
men to whose unflag-
ging and zealous work
must go much credit for
the success of the dance
were: L. Verne Ansel, '31E, Floor; George L.
Johnson, '31E, Orchestra; Robert A. Wolf, '31E,

l.\ THE
SPOTLIGHT
L. VERNE ANSEL
Peoria, gentle readers, is a
modest town of some 100,000 odd
souls who have congregated away
out on the plains of central Illi-
nois. Among the city's note-
worthy contributions to our very
complex social order, there is one
L. Verne Ansel, whose exploits
shall be reviewed in this writing.
Detroit now claims him.
His collegiate career began at the University of Illinois
but, after a year's study there, he transferred to dear
old Michigan, so we will not remark upon his ante-
cedents.
During the first years at University, our friend was
quite submerged in the great mass of struggling under-
classmen wherein few men distinguish themselves. He
began to emerge from beneath this bushel by means of
his work on the staff of the Technic, where he became
a tryout, three years ago. Since that time, he has worked
his way upward through the positions of tryout. Articles
Editor, and finally, Managing Editor. His term of office
expired in February and, at the present time, the new
editor derives the most devilish pleasure from telling
him to get his feet off of the official desk.
Duke's other activities have been quite fertile. He
is listed as a member of Craftmen's Club, Sigma Rho
Tau. debating group. Alpha Tau Sigma, honorary jour-
nalistic fraternity, the Union bookstore committee, and
the Engineering Council. In his junior term he served
on the jacket committee. We regret to admit this, when
we think of the gummy looking combination of mud-
brown and cream that the committee chose, and we don't
want you to think too lightly of our friend's aesthetic
sense, as his vote was probably over-ruled. Besides,
class jackets appear to be going out of style, so it's
not important. Our subject has worked for the Slide
Rule Dance for the past two years; first as general
chairman, this year as floor committee chairman. The
lad evidently has a flare for this sort of work, as he was
one of those "most astute bouncers" at the recent J-Hop.
He does not usually say much about his lesser achieve-
ments, but we understand that he has done some notable
work in the wrestling and pugilistic lines. The Kansas
City meet shall ever suggest fond memories to our neo-
phyte boxer. Hmmmmnini!
T,. Verne is perhaps one of the most prolific promoters
on the engineering side of the campus. He is by no
means a man of a single objective; quite the contrary—
he always appears to have his fingers in numerous pies at
numerous times. His natural aptitude toward publicity
is often quite apalling. but considering that advertising
is one of the powerful keystones of modern business,
it might be the right idea. Duke has many friends on
the campus: they range from modest and shrinking Phi
Betes to bold, bad, Engineers, but they're all friends—
stalwart and true.
dations; and John J. White and Lyle Zisler, '32A,
Decorations.
Some ardent engineer once wrote a poem of
which we are particularly fond (due to a warped
sense of humor), so we are taking the privilege of
printing a stanza for the 'steenth time.
Fools may sing of hearts
and love
And eyes and cheeks
and hair,
\Vrite sonnets to a wo-
man's glove,
And swear her won-
drous fair.
Bah !—She's an artificial
thing,
All powder, paint and
lipstick.
But hearken to the song
I sing-
All hail, my love—the
slipstick.
Should our author ap-
pear at next year's forth-
coming Dance, we are
morally certain that he
will see his way clear to
a reconciliation. It is
extremely regrettable
that he missed the last
one.
Tau Beta Pi
The spring initiation
banquet of Tau Beta Pi,
honorary engineering
fraternity, was held in
the Michigan Union on
Tuesday evening, April
7. Sixteen members of
the junior class were se-
lected to uphold the
standards of this, one of
the most important of the
national honorary socie-
ties. The society recog-
nized the valuable work
done by several mem-
bers of the faculty by
also choosing Professor
G. G. Brown of the
Chemical Engineering
Department, Colonel H.

ALUMNI NEWS
William H. Gerhauser
Nineteen hundred and twenty-eight was certainly
the banner year in the life and career of one who
is probably the outstanding leader in the oldest of
all of the great American industries, the manufac-
ture of ships. For it was during the early months
of this year that almost every big newspaper in
the country ran a small article in
collaboration with the big headline —
displayed on the front page of the
Cleveland "Plain Dealer" an-
nouncing the election of William
H. Gerhauser to the presidency of
the American Shipbuilding Com-
pany to succeed Alfred G. Smith,
who had just announced his re-
tirement. Having realized his
ambitions and having been given
such excellent opportunities for
making a real name for himself
and his profession, Mr. Gerhau-
ser proceeded to set out upon the
task of making fully evident the
justification of his appointment.
That the few years which have
ensued since he stepped into this
highly responsible position have
marked the attainment of the
highest degree of success for this
remarkable leader is plainly at-
tested to by the high regard in which he is held by
his associates and by the respect which is given him
by the business world. It is indeed very fitting that
such an outstanding alumnus should be honored in
these columns and his life briefly sketched for his
interested college friends.
Mr Gerhauser was born in Detroit, Michigan, the
home of many another old Michigan graduate, and
has spent the greater part of his life in the Motor
City. His primary and secondary education was
received in the municipal schools of that city, after
which he entered the old Detroit University Col-
WILLIAM H. GERHAUSER
lege, an institution which has long since passed out
of existence. After graduating with high honors
from this latter preparatory college, Mr. Gerhauser
considered himself sufficiently trained to enter the
halls of higher learning and, in the fall of nineteen
hundred and seven, moved to Ann Arbor in order
to attend the Engineering College
^^^^^^^^= of the University of Michigan.
Four years later, after complet-
ing the regular course of college
life, applying himself industrious-
ly to the usual amount of hard
work which falls to the lot of the
engineering student, and securing
for himself a sound place in the
hearts of all those who came in
contact with his attractive per-
sonality, he was graduated with
the class of nineteen hundred and
eleven. He immediately went out
and started to make his way in
the world, using the same energy
and displaying the same exub-
erance of spirits which had served
him so well during his under-
graduate days.
Chicago and the shipbuilding
industry early claimed Mr. Ger-
hauser's attention since he moved
his belongings to the Windy City within a year
after graduating and became affiliated wth one of
the larger concerns in that metropolis, specializing
in the manufacture of lake freighters and passenger
steamers. A couple of years in Chicago was ac-
companied by such rapid advancement that the
Detroit Board of Commerce offered him a respon-
sible position which he was not at all loathe to
accept since it gave him the opportunity of return-
ing to his native city. Indeed it might very appro-
priately be said that Mr. Gerhauser boosted Detroit
rather vehemently fifteen years ago, since he was a

native son, a product, in part, of her educational
system, and had risen to the position of Assistant
Secretary of the Board of Commerce of that busy
metropolitan area. He probably still believes pret-
ty thoroughly in the Motor City, though Cleveland,
of course, is of prime importance now.
Nineteen hundred and seventeen marked the be-
ginning of the period of the Great War, a factor
which proved to have a rather strong influence on
the career of this promising executive. The influx
of wartime contracts at the American Shipbuilding
Corporation in Cleveland quite naturally resulted
in a call for experienced and talented men to carry
on the greatly expanded building program of this
great concern, the largest of its kind in the country.
Accordingly Mr. Gerhauser was summoned from
across the lake and entered the employ of this mam-
moth organization as assistant to the President. A
year later, the war being over and the business
level returning to normalcy, the American Ship-
building Company reorganized its executive depart-
ment. This resulted in Mr. Gerhauser's election to
the Vice-presidency in acknowledgement of his un-
questionable value to the organization and the un-
doubted competence which characterized all his
work. Then, ten years later, the big job was his.
We wonder, in looking back over his career,
whether it has impressed the reader as much as it
has the chronicler. It is certainly an inspiring ac-
count of a quick rise to the heights of success which
involuntarily excites our admiration for the man
who has been able to achieve it. We are certainly
justly entitled to be proud of any one of our gradu-
ates who has done as much to further the name of
our alma mater as has William H. Gerhauser.

up to his reputation in that particular field of en-
deavor. Fran Bebee spoke for the actives and Jack
Beechler replied for the initiates.
Dean Herbert C. Sadler was the main speaker of
the evening. He stressed the great value of per-
sonality in a man's makeup, and reiterated that it
is necessary when an honorary society, such as
Tau Beta Pi, selects men, that the selection be
based on personality as well as scholarship. The
Dean continued that the men from our colleges
will, in years to come, be in a position to bring their
influence to bear in an attempt to smooth out the
cycles of boom and depression in industry, and that
they should feel obligated to further the interests
of their fellow men.

THE SCIENCE OF FOUNDATIONS
(Continued from Page 7)
relations developed in the present investigation and
the theories of strength of materials which are in
common use in dealing with other materials of con-
struction. The present investigation has shown
that the relations developed are in harmony with
accepted theories and that the problem may be
placed upon a general basis which makes possible
the rational solution of practical problems in foun-
dations which have not before been subject to such
treatment.
The only fundamental difference between the
proposed methods and those in common use lies
in the method of approach to the problem at hand.
In the past those who dealt with problems of
strength of materials have always framed theories
which are satisfactory for an assumed ideal material
but which are admittedly in error for most if not
all actual materials. The theories may be applied
with a reasonable degree of accuracy to materials
which do not depart widely from the ideal material,
but in actual practice many materials deviate so far
from the assumed characteristics that confusion in
methods of dealing with strength of materials has
become a serious handicap.
The usual method of approach to the general
problem of strength has been to place the materials
in various groups which have been subdivided in
accordance with their relations to ideal materials,
namely, the perfect solid and the perfect liquid.
Several intermediate classifications have been intro-
duced and attempts have been made to adjust
strength theories to meet these classifications. The
success of this method of attack has not been par-
ticularly gratifying in many cases, and bearing
capacity of soil is one of these cases.
The attitude in the present investigation has been
to give up any preconceived ideas regarding the
strength of materials where those ideas are based
upon the subdivision of the materials into separate
classifications, and where the classifications are
dealt with by theories which assume conditions, in
many cases to the exclusion of actual facts. In the
writer's opinion if enough is known about a ma-
terial to properly classify it, the whole machinery
of classification becomes obsolete. The identical
properties which are used as the basis of classifica-
tion are the properties which control the strength
of a material. The perfect liquid is the material
which has resistance to volume change but no re-
sistance to shearing stress. The perfect solid is the
material in which the resistance to change in shape
is so great as to make its resistance to volume

change of negligible importance. The whole range
of classification from solid to liquid may be charac-
terized as a range in which the relative proportions
of the two fundamental stress reactions are chang-
ing from one ideal condition to the other. Students
of strength of materials have been called idealists.
In the past the emphasis has been placed on ideal
materials. The present investigation has despaired
of finding an ideal material and has attempted rather
to find an ideal theory.
The method proposed as a result of the present
investigation is to measure the fundamental prop-
erties or stress-reactions of a material and to corre-
late them by a usable theory of strength. This
involves nothing more complicated than the two
stress-reaction coefficients. The success which has
accompanied the application of the proposed meth-
ods to practical problems has been gratifying, and
some of these practical examples are given in the
following references for those who are interested.
The results of a portion of the investigation have
been published by the Department of Engineering
Research of the University of Michigan as Bulletin
13, entitled "A Practical Method for the Selection
of Foundations Based on Fundamental Research in
Soil Mechanics." A revised presentation of this
subject with additional applications to practical
problems will be ready for distribution in January,
1931, under the title Circular 5, "The Physical
Properties of Soil and Their Determination."
The future extension of the research program will
be directed toward the solution of several specific
problems which have arisen during the investiga-
tion of the past four years. The entire problem of
the bearing capacity of pile foundations has occu-
pied a prominent place in the work of the last year
and much remains to be clone in this work. Also,
the determination of the physical properties of soil
by actual load tests on a large scale has proven too
expensive for the ordinary building projects, and
the future work, of necessity, contemplates other
and more economical methods of measurement.
In the light of past results there are at least three
methods which appear promising. First, bearing
capacity tests on a much smaller scale as shown by
the accompanying illustration are much more eco-
nomical and may develop sufficient accuracy. Sec-
ond, there seems to be a very consistent relation
between bearing capacity of cohesive soil and some
very simple measurements which may be made
during the process of core sampling. When soil
samples are obtained by driving a sharpened pipe
open at one end into the soil, the number of blows
of a standard weight falling through a measured
height, necessary to cause a certain penetration,
bear a consistent relation to the bearing capacity of
the soil. The amount the core is compressed is also
a measure of the compressibility of the material
and seems to be related to the settlement which
may be anticipated when the soil is loaded in the
usual way. Third, it seems quite feasible that
when the properties of soil are expressed by no
more than two well known types of resistance, lab-
oratory tests may be devised to measure these two
elements of strength, i.e., A compression test to
measure the coefficient of compressibility and a
torsion test to measure the resistance of the soil
to pure shear.
At the present time plans are being worked out
through which the support of the various organiza-
tions may be united under one central agency which
will undertake the completion of work already
begun and provide for extension of the investigation
along lines which appear most promising. It now
appears that the City of Detroit, Department of
Building and Safety Engineering, will serve as the
centralizing agency and as such will supply at least
a portion of the resources necessary to continue the
investigation. The program contemplates the pre-
sentation to the engineering profession of all of the
results of the investigation as rapidly as they may
be prepared.
The following organizations have been active in
the investigation of the past four years: The City
of Detroit, Department of Water Supply; The De-
troit Edison Company; The Board of Wayne
County Road Commissioners; The City of Detroit
Rapid Transit Commission; University of Michi-
gan; The Detroit Section of the American Society
of Civil Engineers; and The Ford Motor Company.

be faced in the erection of this building, was the
expansion problem. Everyone knows that the ma-
terials of this earth expand with a rise in tempera-
ture and vice versa. For a 75 degree temperature
change, the building will change a little more than
seven inches in length, an amount great enough
for which an allowance must be made. This prob-
lem was met by anchoring only the center span to
the foundation and placing the rest of the structure
on rollers to allow free expansion.
About next month will see the culmination of the
efforts of the Goodyear Zeppelin Corporation take
the air. The new Navy airship "Akron" will be
the largest, most modern, and strongest ship in the
world. It will have a cubical lifting gas displace-
ment of 6,500,000 cubic feet, and a total cubical
displacement of about 7,000,000 cubic feet. Com-
paring this to the size of the ships in existence
today, it will be about twice the size of the "Graf
Zeppelin", about two and one half times as large
as the "Los Angeles", and about 35 per cent larger
than the British R-100. The total lift of the "Ak-
ron" will be 403,000 pounds, with a useful lift of
182,000 pounds; this is a 45 per cent useful lift

PUTTING IDEAS
ON A PRACTICAL BASIS
THE Dow organic laboratory is an almost indispensable
part of the Dow plant, as it is here that most organic
processes originate. Here equipment is developed to estab-
lish a practical plant process before building production
equipment. Here, too, many new processes are created,
and improvements made in old, established methods.
In this laboratory, some 40 men are engaged in putting
ideas on a practical basis. Every facility is available, and
every support given to permit the development of indi-
vidual ideas. Research finds plenty of support at Dow.

while the "Los Angeles" has a 39 per cent useful
lift.
The framework of this new ship embodies designs
which have never before been used. Instead of
only one longitudinal keel, as previously used, it
will have three triangular longitudinal keels, with
a gangway in all three keels. This design greatly
aids in the rigidity of the whole structure. The
main rings, also triangular shaped cross section, are
placed about 74 feet apart and are connected by
longitudinal members at each of their 36 corners.
Near the tail of the ship the main rings have only
24 sides. The 74 foot longitudinal members are
stiffened by single beam rings. The gas cells have
their separation at each main ring and there are
twelve gas cells in the ship; two of these could be

deflated without seriously endangering the ship.
The main ring girders are large enough to form
corridors for the crew members to climb entirely
around the circumference of the ship, permitting
complete accessibility of all parts of the ship, even
when in flight. A network of strong steel wires
aid in the rigidity of the structure and transfer the
gas cell pressure to the framework. To hold this
network of beams in one unit requires about 6,500,-
000 rivets, which are one-eighth inch in diam-
eter.
The motor mounting of this ship is also entirely
new. In previous practice, the use of hydrogen gas,
inflammable and under some conditions explosive,
necessitated the power plants to be placed outside
the ship in cars attached by outriggers so as to
supply ample ventilation and prevent the possibility
of a spark from the motors reaching the hydrogen.
This arrangement, even when the size of the cars
is reduced to a minimum, still contributes con-
siderably to the air resistance of the ship and hence
affects the speed and makes cramped working con-
ditions for the engine crews. In the "Akron" the
motors are placed inside of the hull with a rigid
drive shaft projecting out horizontally and perpen-
dicular to the line of flight. A swiveling propeller,
on the end of the shaft driven by a set of bevel
gears, permits the axis of the propeller to be tilted
through an angle of 90 degrees. With reversible
motors, this feature will be of great importance in
starting and landing maneuvers. It will also per-
mit carrying a greater load and avoid the loss of
lifting gas when the ship has to be landed against
surplus lift.
The ship will have eight Maybach motors of 560
horsepower each, giving a total of 4,480 horsepower.
The maximum speed of the "Akron" and "ZRS-5"
has been calculated to be 83.8 miles per hour. When
running at cruising speed (50 knots) the range
without refuelling will be about 10,500 miles; to
make this fact sound more romantic, the "Akron"
will be able to travel around the world with but one
refuelling stop. A very remarkable possibility and
need in case of an emergency, and virtually a dream
that has come true.
The water recovery system is used in this ship to
compensate for the weight lost due to the gasoline
consumed by the motors. The weight of water
formed per pound of fuel depends upon the chemical
combination of the fuel and the degree of combus-
tion carried out in the motors. In the complete
combustion of the average gasoline, about 1.4
pounds of water is formed per pound of fuel, this
permits a condenser with only a fair efficiency to
recover enough water to serve the purpose.
One of the most novel and picturesque features
of the design of this ship is the provision made for
the storage of five completely assembled airplanes.
The storage compartment, about 75 feet long by
60 feet wide, is located about one-third of the ship's
length from the bow. Collapsible doors in the bot-
tom of the ship cover a T-shaped opening through
which a trapeze with an airplane attacher can be
hoisted or lowered. The airplanes may attach or
detach themselves from the trapeze during flight.
Such a possibility increases the scouting value of
an airship and aids her in warding off an attack.
This feature is also useful in times of peace for
commercial ships, by meeting the ship out at sea
and rushing the fast shipments to the mainland.
The structural design of the "Akron" may be
easily adapted to a commercial ship. Here again
the advantage of an helium-inflated ship presents
itself. In previous passenger-carrying rigid ships,
the presence of hydrogen practically demanded that
the accommodations be placed outside the main
hull. On the other hand, air resistance considera-
tion necessitated keeping all protruding structures
as small as possible. More or less cramped cabins
was the result. In a ship of the general dimensions
of the U.S.S. "Akron" and "ZRS-5", accommoda-

tions may be built in comfortably, providing for up
to 100 passengers, according to the weight of fuel
required for any certain route.
In the case of a 100-passenger ship the following
dimensions are interesting: a total deck area of
12,000 square feet, of which each stateroom, for
two persons, uses an average of over 70 square feet;
promenade decks and corridors have a total length
of about 900 feet and an average width of five feet,
while about 3,500 square feet are used for public
compartments. Promenades, lounges, dining salon,
and smoking rooms are not dreams, but may soon
be realities.
The safety of these new ships cannot be over-
looked. It will be the result of the combination of
great structural strength, multiplicity of indepen-
dent means, practically entire elimination of fire
risk, and accessibility. Too much emphasis cannot
be given to the structural strength of these ships,
which is considerably in excess of that found in
previous ships. The feature of a multiplicity of
means has already been mentioned in respect to the
triple-layer principle. Also that the gas retention
is not in one cell, but in a number of cells. Third
that the propulsion does not rely on one motor unit,
but on eight; the ship may still maintain progress
if several motors should fail.
The fire risk has been reduced to a minimum by
the use of the inert helium gas. The possibility of
a gasoline fire is no greater than, in an automobile.
In fact, fire usually results only from a fuel tank
ruptured in a collision—a remote possibility in an
airship. Precautions are taken, however; the en-
gine rooms have fireproof walls and elaborate fire-
fighting systems; ventilation of the entire ship to
prevent the accumulation of gasoline vapors; gas-
tight electrical connections prevent the ignition of
any local fumes. Thus we see that the ship is well
guarded against fire.
When the airship is finally adopted for ocean voy-
ages, the field in which its application is justified,
it will contribute to overseas transportation. The
airship will not be in competition with the surface
carriers but supplementary to them, for that pro-
portion of passengers and merchandise to whom
higher speed is essential. It will do this without
subtraction of business from existing carriers. All
history shows that speed of travel means volume of
travel. Surface and air lines alike will be bene-
ficiaries as this new vehicle takes its place in the
field of transport, applying in the international field
what America has long learned nationally; namely,
that better communication means better under-
standing, has vast economic advantages, is equally
impressive in the field of human relations.

THE LAW ON MUNICIPAL
CORPORATIONS
(Continued from Page 10)
purchased, does not invalidate the sale. But the
majority of courts hold that the statute is manda-
tory, not directory, and that a violation results in
a void sale. In other words, the manufacturer of
road machinery should be sure that the city has
the authority to purchase a grader before making
the sale. Of course the manufacturer could recover
his own machine if the courts held the sale to be
"ultra vires."
The floating of city bond issues presents a serious
case to either a banking house, or a purchaser for
value of an individual bond. Consider, for instance,
the case where the state limits the bonded indebted-
ness to 5% of the total value of taxable property
within the city. The city now sells bonds, although
the municipal debt is beyond the legal 5% limit,
Smith purchasing one of these bonds on the open
market. At maturity, Smith asks for redemption
of the bond and the city replies that the entire issue
was void. Two situations are presented; one where
the law is specific in requiring the total indebted-
ness to be an open file in the city auditor's office
thus giving constructive notice to the public. This
would seem to place Smith under the necessity
of ascertaining at his peril the extent of the indebt-
edness, and having failed to exercise due caution.
Smith should lose. On the other hand, if the city
prints on the face of the bond that the issue is fully
authorized and that the bonded indebtedness has
not been exceeded, Smith should recover. In other
words, the city should not be given the right to
vary the terms of a written instrument, such as a
printed bond. Modern bonding houses usually
handle the situation by quoting an opinion of some
reputable law firm to the effect that the bond issue
conforms to all requirements of the statutes. Of
course the bonding house is careful to assume no
responsibility for the accuracy of the quoted legal
opinion.
Municipal Liabilities
Activities of the modern city may be classified as
"governmental" or "proprietory." The governmen-
tal functions include operations of fire departments,
police departments, board of public health, etc.
They may be generalized as those classes of "gen-
eral welfare" activities which have ever been recog-
nized as belonging to the sphere of government.
The "proprietory" functions consist of city oper-
ated water works, electric light plants, and those
classes of business enterprises where the corpora-
tion is following a normal industrial pursuit in the
community.
Governmental and proprietory functions are es-
sentially different. The governmental function is
wound up in some indefinite way with the supreme
power of the state. It is known, for instance, that


Page Twenty-Seven
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the fire department must lie unhampered in its
work, as must the police department and the board
of public health. In fact, the public welfare de-
mands that the work proceed even to the injury of
some individual member of the community. Thus
a fire engine can run through the red traffic stop
light without liability for the resulting injury to a
passing automobile. The fire engine was engaged
in a governmental function, although it appears
that if the accident occurs when the fire engine is
returning from the fire, some courts hold the city
liable for the damage.
In the matter of proprietary functions the deci-
sions are distinctly different. The city must now
answer for the negligence of its agents to the same
extent that a private corporation would. And this
rule is a reasonable one, for if the city desires to
enter into an industrial activity on on equal footing
with private enterprises, it should be equally liable
for the responsibilities it has undertaken. In the
case of a city-owned public water supply, the fur-
nishing of water to the householder is a "proprie-
tary" function because the water is paid for as used.
The furnishing of water for a fire hydrant is a
"governmental" function. Thus, if a negligent
water department repair wagon injures an innocent
pedestrian, some courts might look to the nature
of the duty which called out the repair wagon.
Certainly an injury resulting from a trip for the
repair of a private meter would afford no defense
for the city, while the same wagon on an emergency
run to repair the fire hydrant might offer the city
a good defense.
The rules applied to the present case of negli-
gently driven city automobile would apply equally
well to the case of ill kept streets, defective ma-
chinery in city owned electric light plants, etc. The
real test turns on whether the activity performed
is a governmental or a proprietary function.
Legal Remedies Available
The question naturally arises as to what remedies
an individual has if he is injured by the city and
recovers a judgment therefrom. In a civil action
between two private citizens, a money judgment by
a court will sustain a writ of execution authorizing
the sheriff to go out and take any property of the
losing litigant within the jurisdiction of the court.
But with the city the problem is somewhat different.
For instance, the sheriff should not be able to inter-
fere with any of the governmental functions. He
would not be permitted to sell the city jail to the
highest bidder, or the city parks, or schools. With
the case of an unused empty lot on the outskirts of
the city, the problem might be different. But even
the proprietary property might be exempt from
execution. Gas, light, or water works operated by
the city on a profit basis should be immune because
of the public welfare involved.
The ordinary procedure permits the
BRAINS FOR BOILERS
A few years ago when a steam power plant underwent
a heavy load demand, grimy firemen would work feverishly
to keep pace with the cry for more steam. By their back
breaking labor, six men could bring twelve 100 H. P. boilers
from bank to full load in one hour. Coal and air were fed
to the furnaces with little regard to combustion efficiency.
In modern central stations, the conditions are vastly different.
The huge pulverized fuel fired boilers need practically no
human aid when equipped with Bailey Automatic Control.
As the load changes, the correct speed changes are made
on fans, fuel feeders and pulverizers. A 3000 H. P. boiler
can be brought from minimum load to full load in less than
10 minutes time when necessary. Most important, however,
Bailey Meter Control constantly maintains highest com-
bustion efficiency consistent with economical operation.
Modern boilers can think — their brains are the Bailey
Meter Control System.

creditor to bring a writ of mandamus, forcing the
proper city officials to raise the required sum by
taxation. The party is thus eventually given his
relief.
In view of all of these facts it would appear
desirable that the salesman or contractor use rea-
sonable care in dealing with a municipal corporation
to fully assure himself that the acts of the city are
legal. It is possible that the individual may secure
relief on a "quasi-contractual" basis where the city
has unjustly enriched itself at his expense, but the
individual is taking the ever present risk that the
illegal act is of such a nature that recovery against
the city would really subvert the law. The law
was made for the protection of the citizens of the
city as a whole, and the courts are truly reluctant
to jeopardize the welfare of the public where graft
or fraud might be practiced.
WHAT SHALL I READ
(Continued from Page 11)
it was on the whole a tragic experience, for he stood
alone as a statesman in the midst of yapping poli-
ticians. He retired at the end of his first term an
embittered man, feeling that after all the brilliant
promise of his beginnings, his life was to be lived
out under a cloud. Then unexpectedly he was re-
turned to the House of Representatives from his
own country district. He accepted this task quite
in defiance of the wishes and advice of his family
and friends. Few men would have been great
enough, brave enough, to have thus started again at
the foot of the ladder. He went back to Washing-
ton as a simple Congressman, but the years that
followed were the "Great Years" as James Truslow
Adams has called them. Session after session he
fought almost single handed for the constitutional
rights of petition and bombarded Congress with his
petitions for the abolition of slavery and for the
prohibition of inter-state slave trade. One is re-
minded of old Scipio Africanus, another analogous
heroic figure uttering his prophetic warning at
every meeting of the Roman Senate, "Carthage
must be destroyed". The grand old man fell finally,
stricken at the end by death, on the floor of the
Senate.
Charles Francis Adams, the son of old John
Quincy, up to the time he was appointed by Lincoln
to act as Minister to England, had done no unusual
service for his country. He was, to be sure, a na-
tionally known figure, for he had run for the Vice-
Presidency with Van Buren in the campaign of
1848. He had also served as Congressman from
his father's old district. But his largest interest
had been the editing of his grandfather's state pa-
pers, which he had finally issued in ten volumes, a
valuable and fitting monument to his great forebear.
The new Minister arrived in England one week
after Lord Russel had announced that the govern-
ment intended to recognize the Southern Confed-
eracy as a belligerent. He faced the most critical
diplomatic situation in our history. It has been
said that the Civil War was won in England, and
certain it is that had Charles Francis Adams not
steered his course so adroitly through the Trent
Affair, which set aflame antagonisms on both sides
of the Atlantic, and had he not finally, with a defi-
nite threat of war, blocked the sailing of the iron-
clads built in England for the Confederacy, the
cause of the North would have been lost. The
third generation of Adams had performed a service
comparable at least to those of the two preceding.
His subsequent service on the Commission that set-
tled the Alabama Claims inaugurated a new era of
arbitration and mutual good will between England
and the United States.
Of the brilliant men of the fourth generation, the
most interesting was Henry Adams, who had been
his father's secretary at the Legation all through
the dreadful strain of the diplomatic days in Lon-
don. Although he failed, in his own judgment of
himself, to measure up to the great stature of his
father, his grandfather, or his great-grandfather, he
has left us two of the most remarkable books in
American literature, Mont-Saint-Michel and Char-
tres, in which he has recreated the very life of the
thirteenth century, and The Education of Henry
Adams, in which he has traced his own reactions
to the multiplicity of experiences which life brought
him.
In one of the last chapters in The Education of
Henry Adams, he remarks that as he saw the grizzly
terror of Germany frightening England into Amer-
ica's arms, he felt for the first time in his life a sense
of possible purpose working itself out in history.
Certainly it seemed more than mere chance that at
three great crises in the relation between the United
States and Great Britain, an Adams should have
been at hand to serve as Minister to the Court of St.
James; John Adams at the close of the Revolution,
John Quincy at the close of the War of 1812, and
Charles Francis Adams in the critical days of the
Civil War. James Truslow Adams in his book has
balanced \vith nice discrimination the influence of
heredity against the influences of environment in
the record of this dynasty of intellectual aristocrats.
Without making his study a documentary proof of
heredity, he has nevertheless traced the family traits
as they persisted from generation to generation, or
as they were modified of necessity to meet an
altered social environment. As a matter of fact
Charles Francis Adams II, in the fourth generation
was the only member of the family that represented
any very large modification of the type as a capitu-
lation to a changing world. With the others there
was, as years passed, an increasing divergence be-
tween the Adams type and the spirit of the age.


Page Twenty-Nine

It is interesting to note how one hereditary trait,
repeated in each of the first three generations at the
climax of a career, proved the solution of critical
situations. The power of independent judgment
and of courageously assuming personal responsi-
bility was characteristic of all the Adamses. In
1800 John Adams, in the face of almost universal
opposition, at a time when he knew that such
opposition would mean the sacrifice of a second
term, appointed a Minister to France, — an act of
most dramatic significance since it dismissed with
a gesture the threat of war. He himself regarded
it as the most disinterested act of his entire life.
He wished only this inscription on his tomb: "Here
lies John Adams, who took upon himself the re-
sponsibility of the peace with France in the year
1800".
In 1793 when for four days the House had been
a howling mob, because the Clerk in an effort to
control the election of the Speaker, refused to call
the roll, John Quincy Adams rose and moved that
the Clerk be required to call the roll. Instantly he
was recognized as the leader, but cries greeted him
of, "Who will put the question?" Above the tumult
came his thundering old voice, "I intend to put the
question myself." Wise of Virginia said to him.
"Sir, if when you shall be gathered to your fathers,
I were asked to select the words which are best
calculated to give the character of the man, I would
inscribe upon your tomb this sentence: 'I will put
the question myself.'"
In 1863, Charles Francis Adams, after months
of argument with Lord Russell in a vain effort to
prevent the rams built for the Confederacy from
sailing, penned these famous words, "It would be
superfluous in me to point out to your lordship
that this is war." Eight days later he received
word that the British government had given orders
that the rams should be detained. Again an Adams
had assumed alone and unaided the burden of re-
sponsibility at a critical moment in the affairs of
state.
For those who would fill in with more detail the
story of the Adams family as it is so comprehen-
sively outlined by James Truslow Adams, there is
available a wealth of material. All the Adamses
have written voluminously. No one should miss
reading the Education of Henry Adams, nor the
Letters of Henry Adams. These latter supplement
the Education especially \vith reference to the trip
to the South Seas which Henry Adams took with
La Farge. Then there are the Letters of Abigail
Adams, among the most wonderful letters in our
American literature, and the Diary of John Quincy
Adams, that "treasury of damnations" as it has been
called, for to it the great man confided the bitter-
ness of his soul in the torture of his presidential
duties. I should like to add the Pulitzer prjze his-

neers should lend their invaluable aid to the solution
of social problems growing out of the machine age.
It is likely that the problems arising from our
increasing levels of unemployment can best be met
through some form of social insurance. To con-
struct a workable scheme there is need for the
engineer's skill in massing the necessary social data,
and in estimating the tendencies for different lines
of work. Such knowledge and skill are also re-
quired in the planning of public works over a long
period of time with reference to the probable vol-
ume of unemployment. Not only with reference to
unemployment, but also in relation to medical care
are we facing demands for social insurance. Such
plans, of course, are in operation all over the civil-
ized world—outside the United States. If some other
plan is better, let the statistical skill of the engineer
be devoted to the discovery of it. Incidentally, the
present National Committee on the cost of Medical
Care is struggling hard to find some feasible plan
for covering the medical needs of the great mass of
the workers whose average wage is about $1,500.
If it be said that such a problem is outside the
province of the engineer, we should recall that
Colonel Gorgas built the Panama Canal by first
effecting the conquest of yellow fever. If he had
not been a genius in human engineering, his other
skills would have failed him in this great enterprise.
Human resources are the greatest asset of the en-
gineer, just as human wastes are his most tragic
losses.
Let us look to another field, that of housing. The
engineer's machines, like the Pied Piper, have
drawn the populace to the towns, but, again, with
no thought as to how or where they shall live. Our
sprawling cities with their slums, and generally dis-
organized conditions of life would be repudiated as
an exhibit of engineering skill as applied to human
adjustment. But once we begin to think of the
matter, and to consider the way out, we shall have
to recruit both the mechanical and the human skills
of the engineer. In Europe, the architects and the
engineers have gone a long way towards the plan-
ning of their cities with reference to the living
conditions of the people. We can discard the en-
gineer's blueprints for the erection of gallows and
electric chairs, provided that we substitute mass
planning for the homes of the people. The crime
areas in cities are the disorganized slum districts.
Locking up criminals, or putting them to death has
about as much relation to the prevention of crime,
as the killing of individual mosquitoes has to the
control of malaria. In the latter case the engineers
have set to work draining the swamps. Let them
now devote equal effort towards the reclaiming of
our human swamps by applying mass production
to the supply of decent, low-cost housing for the
people.
Previously in this discussion we referred to
Colonel Disque, and his capacity for leadership,
saying that it was unfortunate that he had to be
taken from the prison for war work. Perhaps the
greatest field for the application of social engineer-
ing is the management of our vast prison pop-
ulations. A competent industrial engineer could
survey almost any one of our prisons and be shocked
at the crass incompetency there to be found in the
planning of work in relation to men. He would find
no careful sorting of men with reference to types
of work, little industrial hygiene, almost no voca-
tional guidance, and a negligible amount of scientific
industrial training. In many instances our prisons
are a chaos of politics, incompetency, and brutality.
Still, ignorant, respectable people complain that we
are coddling prisoners, because we give them fresh
air once a day, a chapel service on Sundays, and
a movie once a week! I should like to give a Henry
Ford the job of creating an industrial efficiency in
our prisons, having reference to the production of
men as well as goods. Or we can think of a Colonel
Disque taking large groups of prisoners to some of
the waste lands of Michigan to engage in extensive
reforestation, and the rebuilding of men. In scrip-
tural terms here is a field "white unto the harvest."
All that is lacking is leadership.
We may mention one other field for the applica-
tion of social engineering, that of government.
President Hoover has led the way towards making
the government a fact gathering agency, proceed-
ing on the sound engineering principle of no action
without data. All of our governmental and social
problems require research as the basis of planning.
To some extent this technique has filtered into city
affairs, through our bureaus of governmental re-
search, and the adoption of the city manager sys-
tem. But only a beginning has been made, and the
field is wide open for the further introduction of
engineering methods in government. Of course,
the people must learn to have confidence in the
expert. Where the technician has failed to put over
a well-conceived plan, however, the result may
come from the expert's naivete in dealing with the
"human element".

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
If we have indicated something of the field of
social engineering, we may conclude by returning
to the fundamental question of the requisite quali-
ties for such work. As I see the matter, they are
knowledge, social imagination, and leadership. The
knowledge should be of human nature and of social
conditions, which must be acquired outside the
laboratory. Some of it can be gotten from books,
but more from experience with all sorts and condi-
tions of people. One who has contacts with only
those of his own class can never learn much about
society as a whole. Robust knowledge requires a
broad human experience. From this follows the
second necessary quality, namely social imagination
or sympathy. This need not be maudlin or vision-
ary, but it must produce insight. The identification
of oneself with others is not merely an emotional
experience, but has, also, an intellectual quality.
It is what distinguishes mechanical from humanized
knowledge. It is banned in physical science, but is
the touchstone of all social inquiry. Without it the
engineer better stick to his slide-rule. Finally, lead-
ership is the sales department of social engineering.
Perhaps leaders are born; but, if they are, there
must be favorable conditions for their development.
What Michigan engineers might do to cultivate
their latent talents in this direction is a problem of
education. It might not be amiss to say that, at
least, they could look into the techniques and types
of research that are being furthered by the sociolo-
gists. As evidence that the two fields are not so
far apart, I may remind the readers of the Michigan
Technic that the late Professor Charles H. Cooley
had training as an engineer. The term social plan-
ning sums up the whole burden of this discussion.

that the boys are well looked after as far as spare
time is concerned.
The business part of camp starts at 7:30 A.M.
with about an hour of snappy drill and then class-
room work the rest of the day. The classroom
work consisted of code practice, radio procedure,
message center work, meteorology, telephone in-
stallation and operation, and radio operation. The
first three weeks work was mostly classroom work
and then the last three weeks were spent in actual
installation, and operation of communication equip-
ment in the field. Of special interest was the com-
munications carried on between the ground and a
plane. An Army observation plane from St. Louis
came up to Fort Sheridan one day as a special
feature and signals were exchanged by radio and
also by laying out large letters on the ground. The
plane acknowledged the messages both by radio and
rockets.

There is probably no other manufacturing plant in
the world producing such a diversity of machinery as
Allis-Chalmers. In addition to building steam and
hydraulic turbine generator units for producing elec-
tric power, transformers and switchgear to facilitate
its handling and motors to utilize it, Allis-Chalmers
also builds machinery for all of the basic industries.
It is an even bet that your morning cereal and the
flour in your bread were produced with Allis-Chalmers
machinery. The same is true of the lumber, the
cement, the crushed stone, mineral products, and
many other materials you see every day.

The last full week of camp was spent on all day
tactical field problems. Representative groups from
the several schools were placed in charge of opera-
tions on different days, thus adding extra incentive
to doing the work well. The problems were illus-
trative of the types of solutions for handling com-
munications between the Rear Echelon, Division
Headquarters, and Brigade Headquarters in offen-
sive and defensive positions, and the switching over
of lines during movements of troops. The final day
of field work was a demonstration before the In-
fantry companies of typical communication equip-
ment and installations and the organization of both
the division signal company and the Infantry com-
muications unit.
During the camp session each man must serve
on certain details. These details are: guard duty,
charge of quarters, table waiter, and kitchen police.
Many are the experiences that are related to tent-
mates the next day after guard duty. The guard
changes at formal guard mount, 4:00 P.M. The
new guard is on for twenty-four hours and is di-
vided into three watches, each watch being on duty
two hours and off duty four hours. Some of the
boys were actually entrusted with guarding federal
prisoners. The charge of quarters must get up the
cadet officers in the morning, sweep out the orderly
tent, distribute the mail, and remain on duty at the
orderly tent until taps at 11:00 P.M. It really is

a big day for him but his hardest job is to try
to produce letters out of the mail bag for fellows
who had no letters coming but still thought there
ought to be one for them. I don't think that the
table waiters and kitchen police need any explana-
tion.
On Monday of the last half week of camp the
whole R.O.T.C. battalion set out for the Great
Lakes Naval Training Station. The day was hot
and we were carrying heavy packs, and the Infantry
men carried rifles too. When the line of men
marched under the viaduct and through the gates
of the training station, the loads began to feel a
little lighter and all minds turned to thoughts of
showers and food. After the noon day meal the
column formed again and moved north of the main
group of buildings to pitch camp. The companies
formed in column, opened ranks and then took in-
terval, the front and rear rank men pairing off and
setting up their pup tents. In half an hour a small
city of little tents had sprung up and the camp was
established for the night. The rest of the after-
noon was spent in inspecting the radio station and
other things of interest, and resting up for the trip
back. In the evening the men were given a free
movie and then most of them crawled into their
pup tents to try to sleep. The following morning
we broke camp and started the march back to Fort
Sheridan.

Wednesday all the rest of our equipment was
turned in and the men were given another physical
examination to check up for injuries that might
have been received at camp. The next morning
the boys all checked out for home and points of in-
terest along the way. I understand that some of
them had more adventures on the way home than
they had coming.
One fact about these camps that stands out is
that the men who attend will always remember the
fine time they had and it's something that they all
talk about when there is a gathering of these men.
Many friendships are made here that continue after
camp breaks up and many helpful suggestions are
pooled from the letters that pass from men at one

might be termed as one of the minor big events
in these young men's lives.

COLLEGE NOTES

"The Sound of a Shadow"
One of the most engrossing lectures that we have
been privileged to hear in quite some time was
given under the above title by Mr. J. B. Taylor of
the General Electric Company. It was presented in
the Natural Science auditorium on the evening of
March 17.
A very pleasing speaker, with a flair for show-
manship, Mr. Taylor highly entertained, as well as
instructed his audience. Presenting a resume of the
development of the photoelectric cell from the first
discovery of the characteristics of selenium up to
the modern day application of the alkali metal cells,
he very tangibly demonstrated his topic through
the medium of a most complete outlay of equip-
ment. The multiplicity of uses to which these little
cells can be put seems to have been overlooked by
Professor Lucifer Butts of cartoon fame. From
more obvious tasks such as counting the number
of hours of daylight for the weather man and ma-
rine buoys, they can apprehend thieves and count
the things passing before them. Within a short
radius they can replace radio waves by those of
light for purposes of communication. And with ap-
propriate auxiliaries the}' can boil a perfect ten-
minute egg with no more effort on the part of the
operator than a wave of the hand. (Our own idea.
—Ed.)
Many members of the Detroit technical societies
made the trip out expressly for the lecture, and of
the local attendance hundreds must have been un-
able to find standing room. The lecture was ex-
tremely gratifying in that it was another demon-
stration to the public how truly spectacular are the
commonplace tools with which modern engineer-
ing works.
An Outstanding Design
Among bent tube boilers now offered by manufacturers
the three drum type has become increasingly popular.
Among three drum boilers, the Wickes Design has been
firmly established by the proven performance of actual
installations.
The simple arrangement of drums and tubes makes pos-
sible easy accessibility to both fire and water sides of
the heating surface. Positive circulation delivers water
to the tubes at all ratings.. Steam carrying tubes in a
high temperature zone deliver superheated steam to the
nozzle outlet. Tight baffling prevents gas short circuiting
and therefore promotes maximum heat absorption. These
are but a few of the advantages which have made the
Wickes Three Drum Boiler a successful unit in daily
operation.

Summoning a Ghost to your bidding
The chemist Van Helmont in 1609 discovered
an invisible substance, an emanation from coal,
that he named "geist," meaning ghost,
shortened in English to gas.
Only now do its miraculous possibilities begin
to be glimpsed. Only now can modern industry,
like a latter-day Aladdin rubbing his lamp to
summon a vaporous genii, turn a valve and
order this Ghost to any one of a hundred tasks.
From the beginning, the problem was one of
piping. When Crane Co., a half century ago,
set itself to develop and produce the right
materials for every gas and oil purpose, it began
an incalculably valuable contribution to the
solution of problems that had held back the gas
industry since the Chinese used hollow bamboo.
So in the development of the natural and manu-
factured gas industry, as in practically every
other industry, the Crane line of valves,fittings,
fabricated piping, and specialities have played
an important part. No matter what branch of
industry you enter, you will find Crane
materials playing a similarly important part.

It is a new office building for
the Metropolitan Life Insurance
Company.
Once more architects have
designed a modern structure of
beauty and symmetry. Once more
engineers and builders have
turned architects' plans into actu-
ality. And once more Dynamite
was first on the job to blast out
some 70,000 yards of rock so that
the foundation might be placed.
Dynamite is the ally of the
modern engineer. It is the tool
without which carefully designed
plans for many heroic under-
takings would never be more than paper plans.
Skyscrapers. Tunnels under mountains, rivers
and cities. Bridges and highways. Dams and
reservoirs. These and numerous other engineer-
ing marvels are built with the aid of Dynamite.
Dynamite digs into the earth and blasts out raw
materials used in the making of countless articles
we use every day.

KOEHIUNC AUTOCYCLE PAVER
A PIONEER and a leader among pavers, the
Koehring leads in basic developments—the
latest of which is the Koehring autocycle.
Just as Koehring developed the boom and
bucket, batchmeter, and the five action re-
mixing principle—Koehring developed the auto-
cycle, a principle for automatically controlling
the cycle of charging, mixing and discharging,
creating entirely new standards of efficiency in
paver operation.
The Koehring autocycle is a means of providing
a fast, exact automatic sequence of batchmeter-
timed operations. It makes the most of every
minute and provides an ample factor of safety.
Time is saved at both ends of the cycle, in charg-
ing the materials and in discharging and placing
the concrete, resulting in increased output per
day.
The concrete roadbuilding industry has experi-
enced the importance of this principle—the
Koehring autocycle of charging, mixing, dis-
charging. The industry knows the Koehring is
more than merely a paver—that it is a plus
service rendered, that it sets the pace on a con-
crete paving project, that it produces standard-
ized dominant strength concrete of unvarying
uniformity!

Research in Fluid Motion and Its
Application to Aeronautics
llv MILTON .1. THOMPSON. Assistant Professor of Aeronautical Engineering
A I/THOUGH aeronautics is one of the young-
est branches of tlie fields of engineering and
transportation, it has advanced by tremend-
ous leaps and bounds in the past two decades, and
undoubtedly a great deal of credit for this rapid in-
crease in the knowledge pertaining to aerial flight is
due to the fact that many of its problems have been
vigorously attacked by scientific methods. At the
present time research
w o r k in aeronautical
problems is being car-
ried on in laboratories in
nearly all of the princi-
pal countries of t li e
world, and the present
paper is an attempt to
give a brief review of
some of the modern de-
velopments in this field.
One of the oldest divi-
sions of aerodynamic re-
search consists of those
problems which may be
considered as being in
the realm of the motion
of fluids. Chief among

these is that of the de-
termination of the forces acting on an airfoil or air-
plane wing moving through the air. An enormous
amount of experimental work has been done in wind
tunnels in order to determine the effect of changes
in the shape of a wing-section as well as the be-
havior of wings with ditfeernt plan forms. This
problem has also been attacked from a theoretical
point of view. Kutta and Joukovsky in 1910 worked
out independently a method for determining the
"lift" and drag", that is, the components of the air
reaction perpendicular and parallel respectively to
the relative wind direction, acting on a unit length
of a wing of infinite span. Their solution was ob-
tained by an application of the mathematical theory
of hydrodynamics, based on the simplfying assump-
tions that the fluid was "perfect" or non-viscous,
and incompressible. According to this theory the
lift is directly proportional to the inclination or
angle of attack of the wing section, the mass den-
sity and the square of the velocity of the air, and
= the area of the wing in
plain view, while the
drag force is equal to
7. e r (&gt;. The Kutta-Jou-
kovsky formula for lift
agrees qualitatively with
the results of experi-
ments if the angle of at-
tack of the wing is main-
tained at a relatively
small value, while the
fact that the resistance
to forward motion is
zero, an example of the
paradox of d'Alembert
is of course, no contra-
clition to reality.
Several other writers
= have attempted to modi-
ify the Kutta-Joukovsky theory by using different
types of theoretical flows around the section of the
infinitely long wing. In this connection the work
of Witoszynski and Dupont should be mentioned.
However, from a practical point of view, the most
interesting development along this line is the in-
duced drag theory originated by Prandtl. This
theory attempts to explain the disagreement be-
tween that of Kutta and Joukovsky and exper-
iments by considering the flow around a wing
of finite span, and it shows that in the latter
case the modification of the flow is such that the

lift force vector is rotated backward through a
small angle, which in turn induces a horizontal
force coiuponet or "induced drag" in the direc-
tion opposed to the motion of the wing. The de-
tails of this theory are of a rather complex mathe-
matical nature, the general solution involving the
use of Fourier's series, but results have been ob-
tained for twisted and tapered monoplane wings,
biplanes and other wing combinations.
Using this theory, considerably better agreement
is obtained with experimental results but there is
still an appreciable discrepancy between the actual
and theoretical value of the drag. It has thus been
found necessary to consider the effect of viscosity.
originally neglected in
the theory, in order to ~ ~~"
obtain a complete pic-
ture of the mechanism
&lt;if fluid resistance. Here
the so-called ''boundary
layer theory" of Prandtl
has yielded the most
fruitful results. T h i s
theory is based on the
hypothesis that in the
neighborhood of a body
moving in a fluid, there
is a layer of fluid close
to the surface in which
the velocity changes rap-
idly from zero to some
finite value, and that in
this layer the viscous
forces acting on the fluid
particles, which depend
on this velocity gradient,
are sufficiently large to
be of importance. Out- ~
side of the boundary layer the flow is assumed to be
that of an non-viscous fluid. A great deal of re-
search work of both an experimental and theoreti-
cal nature has been done in this field, particularly
in Germany. England, and Holland. Careful in-
vestigations of the velocity distribution in the
boundary' layer have been made for the flow in
pipes, channels, and around flat plates, cylinders
and past curved walls, while many mathematicians
have attempted to obtain solutions to Stokes' equa-
tions for viscous flow under these special re-
strictions. Thus more and more knowledge of these
very complicated flow phenomena is being ob-
tained. It is now known, for example, that the flow
in the boundary layer may be either laminar or
turbulent, depending on the value of the Reynolds
number, that is. the product of the velocity and a
characteristic length, divided by the kinematic co-
efficient of viscosity. In the case of an airplane
wing, the characteristic length is taken as the chord.

NAUTICAL
while in the boundary layer theory it is the thick-
ness of the layer. Bodies of different shapes pos-
sess a critical value of the Reynolds number at
which the flow suddenly changes from laminar to
turbulent and at which there is a marked drop in
the drag coefficient.
The methods of making these experiments on
velocity distribution are quite interesting since the
instruments used for the observations must be suffi-
ciently small so as not to appreciably disturb the
flow around the body. Hansen, at the Aerodynamic
Institute in Aachen, has made some investigations
on the boundary layer of a flat plate using glass
Pilot tubes of 0.0083" inside diameter and 0.0138"
_^^__________^^^^_ outside. Other experi-
menters have employed
a so-called '"hot-wire"
instrument, which con-
sists of a fine resistance
wire mounted between
two terminals and
through which an elec-
trical current is passed.
The motion of the air
produces a cooling effect
and a change in the re-
sistance of the wire
which depends on the
wind velocity, and by
keeping the resistance
constant by means of a
Wheatstone bridge, the
determination of varia-
tions in current makes it
possible to find the mag-
nitude and direction of
the wind-speed.
"In addition to the as-
sumption of a non-viscous fluid, the original theory
of flow was also based on the supposition that the
fluid was incompressible. This hypothesis has been
shown to be a legitimate one in the case of air, pro-
vided the velocities are under 300 miles per hour,
but with the advent of higher speeds in modern
aircraft, and especially in propellers where veloci-
ties higher than those of sound are sometimes
reached, compressibility is found to be an important
factor. Recently, considerable attention has been
devoted to this field both in this country and in
Kngland. Briggs and Dryden, of the U. S. Bureau
of Standards, have made wind tunnel experiments
on circular arc airfoils at speeds varying from 0.5
to 1.08 times the velocity of sound. Taylor and
Sharman, in England, have also developed a method
for solving this problem based on an extension of
Rayleigh's analogy between the two-dimensional
flow of a compressible fluid and the electrical flow

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The Suggestion System
By B. L. ROBERTSOX
MI-JIM of IVim State Engineering College
THK suggestion system, \vliicli is quite highly
developed in many large companies, is one of
the very interesting and important sides
of any organization which uses it. By virtue of it,
all workers have the opportunity of helping to in-
crease the efficiency of their company, and it is no
small part of efficiency engineering. The keynote
to the success of the system is that the employee
who has taken upon himself the advancement of his
idea is recognized for his efforts. ^^^^^^^^_
If the suggestion is favorably con-
sidered he is awarded according to
its value, the award usually being
of a monetary value.
Practically all companies,
whether manufacturing, sales,
public utility, or otherwise, which
profess modern methods of im-
provement within themselves, em-
ploy- some means whereby their
employees can help the organiza-
tion by turning in suggestions for
its betterment. In the smaller
groups the worker generally goes
directly with his suggestions to his
superiors. It may be that he is
asked now and then for his comments. More often,
however, and this is true in the company with which
the author lias been employed, the system consists
of available paper blanks and envelopes, properly
made in form, and placed in conspicuous positions.
On these blanks the employee writes out his sug-
gestions, discussing them in brief but making note
of their most important features. The enclosed
blanks are then put in a small box. the contents of
which are collected at regular intervals.
After the blanks are gathered in they are dis-
cussed before a committee whose purpose is to pass
judgment on these suggestions. The points of
merit of each idea are examined and their possibili-
ties investigated. If the ideas appear fruitful and
seem worthy of consideration they are given a trial.
The originator of the scheme is called before the
committee and the matter taken up with him, per-
haps in connection with its details or in the further
application of the scheme to another situation.
Often the suggestion is improved upon before being
put into operation, for discussion of the subject will
usually bring forth a few details of perfection. In
many instances a very small change in method or
tools will bring about a startling result in time,
money, or effort associated with a particular opera-
IT is the desire of the
Technic to give to its
readers the views of
Michigan Men in the dif-
ferent fields of Engineer-
ing. We welcome the re-
turn of Mr. B. L. Robert-
son to our columns, who

dustry and Engineering

tion. This, briefly, is a description of the plan by
which organizations encourage contributions and
cooperation from their employees. The desirabili-
ties of the suggestion system are plainly evident.
The suggestions themselves may be in any of a
wide variety of forms and may pertain to any
branch or type of work which the company does.
They may have to deal with a small change in the
method of an operation, the different use for an old
_^ tool, or the design of a new tool.
They are, in the case of the man-
ufacturing company, generally
ideas for improving an article to
be manufactured, either in sim-
plicity, rendering it capable of
new uses, shortening its time of
process, or in bettering its looks.
One large manufacturing com-
pany publishes a list of awards
every two weeks and includes
with the name of the receiver of
the award his department and the
fundamentals of his suggestion.
Scanning a list of recent awards
it is noticed that most of the sug-
gestions are for improvements on
existing machines, tools, or apparatus. Many are
changes in some operation, to be accomplished
either by hand or by machine, and a few are for new
devices for performing an old or a new operation.
And now and then there is an award for a safety de-
vice.
The awards range from a minimum of $5 to a
maximum of $1200, the larger figure being decided-
ly unusual. On picking out several lists at random
it is noticed that of 480 awards, two are for $250, one
for $200, twelve from $100 to $150, eighteen from
$50 to $75, fifty from $25 to $35. twenty-four for
$20, forty-nine for $15, one hundred and four for
$10, and two hundred and twenty for $5. These
are average values and indicate very well the recog-
nition given to suggestions. Remuneration always
accompanies a suggestion which is found valuable
and adopted, and it has happened that some schemes
have worked so well the originator has later had
his award increased by the suggestion committee.
To most people the suggestion system is new,
but perhaps not so new in its principle as in the
manner in which it is carried out. We have all
heard in this day about efficiency engineering and
management. The thought which comes to us as
\ve hear this expression is that of some well paid in-

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
dividual who is called in by a company which feels
itself slipping in business methods, or which senses
that it is not making the best of its possibilities.
This person enters the firm and spends a certain
length of time looking over its present methods,
makes a few recommendations, and then goes to
another place, often, however, keeping in close con-
tact with those firms which he has just left. With
large organizations the efficiency expert stays with
the company and devotes all of his time to that one
duty of improving methods and devices.
We do not stop to reali/e that the suggestion
system, which today is a well organized unit in
those companies which use it, had its lowly begin-
nings. It is but a natural outgrowth of the old
time spirit of the small factory in which each
worker kept his ideas to himself. He reasoned that
if he could do something better than his neighbor,
or knew something his neighbor did not know, he
was entitled to use that information to his own
good and to cash in on it himself. Such reasoning
is faulty because it is incomplete. The worker did
not realize that his value came in others knowing
vvh.it he could do, and that by keeping informa-
tion to himself his fellow workers and superiors
would never find out just what was bis value. The
spirit behind the motive was selfishness. \Yli&lt;'n he
left his place of work his ideas went with him. Ik-
wanted to be paid in direct ratio to the effort re-
quired to install and train a new workman in his
place, and not for what he could do to benefit his
employer.
The obvious solution to such a problem is effici-
ency management as employed in modern organi-
zations. The field is of course very broad and is
only touched upon here, but the suggestion system
is one side of it and plays no small part in the life
of a large factory. The new concept is that each
worker can be an efficiency expert of his own ac-
cord. The company takes advantage of the sug-
gestions offered by its many workers and they are
in turn accordingly benefited.
As a rule, an employee's mental picture of a big
company, before he enters it. is none too well de-
fined. The size and extensiveness of the organiza-
tion somewhat awes him. He usually thinks of it
as merely a mass of many thousand workers, each
worker just one of the many, and everything pro-
duction. Too often it is felt that the organization
is so well planned out that there is no further room
for improvement, that suggestions from him will
not be new but will have been thought of before
by older and more experienced heads, and that the
little things in a large company are too small to
value. In this connection, however, it is the little
suggestions arising here and there which constantly
increase the productivity of an organization, and
every employee may thus become a very useful unit
by being constantly on the lookout for them. Funda-
mentally, it is really a duty to suggest improve-
ments.
The suggestion system encourages a wide awake
inventive state of mind of the worker, and the
state of mind is of more importance in getting re-
sults than is long experience or age. Men who have
the attitude necessary to think of improvements en-
joy their work to a greater extent. They think
of it not as drudgery but as a chance to display their
personal characteristics. They have the joy of
striving to do a job well, of having tried to bet-
ter something with which they have come into con-
tact. Their attitude makes them feel superior to
their condition, of being more than a mere machine.
Such a man, after all, is the really successful type of
worker.
The best way to do things has, of course, to be
worked out scientifically. To do things over and
over the same old way, simply because they always
have been done that way, is poor engineering. The
results of the suggestion system show up many of
these instances. In the history of improvements,
changes have been made in everything from tools,
height of table or bench., position of machines, mo-
tion of operation, to light, heat, ventilation, com-
fort, and time for rest. All of these subjects come
under the scope of suggestions because they are
all of such a nature that they can be improved.
If a worker finds a way in which he can do a
definite job with less expenditure of effort and time
than he put into it before he will automatically do
the job the new way. It is worth it to him for the
effort saved, and being an advantage to him it fol-
lows that others should also be allowed the benefit
of it. The remuneration in the form of money, of
the suggestion committee is his reward for the dis-
closure of the idea.
Suggestions are not confined, either, to just the
factory and its methods and the instances are many
in which suggestions to others, and cooperation
with them, has been of extreme benefit to the alert
engineer. In this connection I wish to repeat a little
story which the head of my department (while I was
with the industry) told a group of severa lyoung
fellows not so long ago. It so deeply impressed me
that I shall not forget it, and its application to the
system we are discussing is readily seen. He said
that we should not lose any opportunity, however
small, in helping our neighbors in engineering. We
should contribute as we could conveniently do so
of our time, effort and thought to those about us
and their problems. This he illustrated by partic-
ular examples. He had worked with a fellow engi-
neer on a small problem simply because he was
interested in it and because the other was grateful

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The Mentor System
HOWARD S. 4 0\4.l It -;t I i:
THE entering freshman comes to Ann Arbor
in September and is confronted with a task
the like of which he has never tackled before.
The type of work he must do to master his studies
is naturally very different from what was en-
countered in high school. The amount of work is
greater. He has been transplanted into the en-
vironment of college life, which he must learn to
follow. A personal sense of responsibility must be
developed and, in short, a rapid and complete ad-
justment to college and to life must be effected.
Most freshmen experience difficulties in the
process of adjustment and while the College does
not propose to treat them as ___
immature boys, it has recog-
nized that a certain amount of
definite supervision and per-
sonal guidance is a distinct
benefit. For this reason the
College of Engineering of the
University of Michigan, eigh-
teen years ago. installed what
is known as the Mentor Sys-
tem.
Each freshman is assigned to
a personal Mentor, there being
fifteen to twenty men assigned
to each Mentor who is a mem-
ber of the faculty and who has
had considerable training in
this tvpe of work. The Head
Mentor, whose appointment is
permanent, is responsible for
policies and introduction of
new ideas; obtains and trans-
mits all reports and supervises
the system as a whole. Each
class is detailed a Class Mentor

years with the class and is ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
their personal adviser throughout this period.
Weekly assemblies are held and advise of a general
nature is given to freshman group in the form of
talks by the Head Mentor and others.
The freshmen first know their Mentors as Orien-
tation Week Advisers who pilot them through the
functions of this period. The instructors of the
Freshmen Engineers turn in reports on class stand-
ing, progress-rate, etc., on the fifth and tenth weeks
of each semester, to the Head Mentor who in turn
sends them to the individual Mentors. The fresh-
ment then learn where they stand and are given
timely advice when necessary. The Mentor is per-
sonally very well acquainted with each man as he
has a farily complete report on the character of
every individual. The report is compiled from the
various tests and quizzes that have been given.
Each fellow understands that at all times he is free
to have interviews and discuss his problems and am-
bitions with his Mentor. The idea is perhaps best
expressed in the words of Dr. Mortimer E. Cooley,
Dean Emeritus, under whose regime the system was
established, "The Mentor should be the elder broth-
er and should see that every man in his group gets
the largest possible benefit from his college life".
— At the present time the only
other class which enjoys the
advantages offered the Fresh-
men Engineers is the Senior
Class. They are, as a rule,
well known to their respective
department heads due to the
fact that it is through these
men that they will get their
start in the world. On the
other hand, there are the sopho-
mores and juniors who are ex-
periencing difficulties just as
important as those of the fresh-
man and senior. Their ad-
vanced standing does not pre-
clude the necessity of an ex-
perienced adviser. In fact, the
problems which they face are
far more important than those
of the average freshman. Some
are faced with the problem of
deciding on which branch of
engineering to stud}'. Others
are in trouble due to changing
from one course to another.
^= The high scholarship average
made by a student may suddenly drop to the point
of failure due to some unforseen or unavoidable out-
side influence, such as a death or divorce in the fam-
ily or any number of other reasons. Men who find
themselves in such predicaments are in dire neces-
sity of a wise and sympathetic Mentor. The Class
Mentor cannot possibly fill the bill because, usual-
ly, his interests and sympathies will be elsewhere.
The system of Class Mentors has never accom-
plished its intended purpose and it is practically im-
possible to make it do so. A large percentage of

Beauty In Architecture
Raymond M. Hood's conception of Beauty
IIv ARTHUR MttKSINU *:i IA
EAUTY, the quality so readily sensed, yet so
very difficult to hypothesize or resolve, forms
the vortex of many discussions, also of many
formal statements concerning personal and group
philosophies appearing in print.
Is beauty a synthetic quality? With preferences
varying greatly, is there anything beautiful for
everyone? Why is any certain quantity beautiful?
These questions, and more which logically present
themselves, Raymond M. Hood, a prominent Chi-
cago architect, answers according
to his conceptions, in an article
under the above title, appearing
in a recent issue of a current mag-
azine. We listen with expectant
interest as a man who obviously
appreciates beauty understand-
ingly, and has the ability to
utilize his appreciation, progmati-
cally develops what may be the
creed of the modern criteria-seek-
ing architect.
Mr. Hood very emphatically
answers our first question nega-
tively in his first few sentences,
writing—"Beauty is not a gas, a
thin liquid coating, or a perfume.
It is not a touch of blue in just
the right spot, nor is it any other
talistnanic touch that transforms
an ugly object into a thrilling
masterpiece."
He also flaunts the idea
of
beauty as a resultant of "Artistic genius and good
taste", believing that persons presumably possess-
ing these qualities, while trying to give beauty fin-
ish, social standing and culture exploit it, quoting
from the article—"In the end they make it conform
to the free and easy graces of the world, but it may
be sadly compromised". A bit later, Mr. Hood
abnegates reference to an artist for definitions of
beauty, or as a means of determining standards,
comparing such a person to a priest in religious
circles, and explaining—"He is the self-constituted
priest of the cult of beauty. Like the priesthood
of any religion, he makes a business out of its ex-
pansion and development. He surrounds his call-
ing with mystery in order to keep the ritual to him-
self."
Jury determination of aesthetic merits, or rather
beauty and lack of beauty, finds no advocate in Mr.
_ Hood. Ksoteric judging, he con-
tends, produces conformity, and,
"Conformity is the refuge of
those who wish to exploit beauty".
Conformity to standards and rules
of art or the theories of artists is
not beauty in his opinion. Artis-
tic genius, good taste and con-
formity, the "Three Musketeers"
are dangerous, if not actually-
emasculating to aesthetic quali-
ties. We find this hypothesis
nicely illustrated in the somewhat
overly-developed Greek Corinthi-
an Architecture.
Mr. Hood, after he has followed
through a labyrinth of negations,
presents his creed of beauty very
comprehensibly and decisively in
these words—"It is that beauty-
is utility, developed in a manner
to which the eye is accustomed
by habit, in so far as this develop-
ment does not detract from its quality or usefulness.
Habit, tradition and environment facilitate the rec-
ognitions and acceptance of beauty. They form the
sugar coating without which perverse human nature
might at times reject even what it really likes. But
the intellect and reason pronounce final judgment.
If an object satisfies the intellect, it is immaterial
whether or not it conforms to any theory of beauty.

any system of composition, any accepted rule of
art, or any philosophical analysis. It is beauty."
In the history of architecture, furniture and dec-
oration, along with all other objects that are used,
the one dominating factor is utility. Artists have
added and subtracted many varying qualities to
and from these objects, but it is always utility that
reappears as the lasting and accepted beauty.
The steam locomotive, the airplane, the automo-
bile, the ocean liner, the battleship, watches, tele-
phones, the Bessemer converter, according to Mr.
Hood, are all "Objects whose design was deter-
mined by efficiency, and all are satisfying in their
appearance." He writes—"There is no mechanical
contrivance or implement of pure utility developed
to a degree of perfection that does not attract and
hold the attention of even the purest aesthetes by
its form and expression—Rightness of engineering
design resulted in Tightness of appearance."
When the commonly accepted idea of beauty in
women reverts to the healthy, vigorous, slender and
clean woman, as compared to the languorous,
anemic, easily disarranged feminine person.
Mr. Hood epitomizes his discussion meditating
upon the allegory of the two children in Maeter-
linck's "The Bluebird", who searched the world
over for happiness only to return and find it in
their own garden. We seek in wide fields for a
mysterious something that will suit, our ideal of
beauty only to ultimately realize—"that all the
simple things are beautiful and that there is no
mysterious complication about it. Real beauty lies
in usefulness."
However, Mr. Hood reminds us that there is one
form of beauty beyond human understanding, and
that is the beauty of Nature's phenomena. He con-
cludes amenably saying—"But in the category of
man-made beauty, we must admit that if utility is
not synonymous with beauty, it is al least the dom-
inating quality in its composition."
THE ARCHITECTS!
BOOK SHEI
Da
NEW WORLD ARCHITECTURE
By Sheldon Cheney
In this day and age we come in contact with many
books written by prominent architects of this age,
but few of them have been able to offer us a work
so complete in its subject and so enlightening
as Sheldon Cheney's—"New World Architecture".
Not written in a cold and austere manner as most
people visualize books of this type; it possesses a
fictional characteristic which carries one on enjoy-
ing every step of the way. One is at a loss to really
explain "New World Architecture" in a manner fit-
ting to it and satisfactory to the writer; the only
ultimate thing one can do is to let the book speak
for itself, and in the following lines condensed but
fully covering that chapter contained in the book on
Frank Lloyd Wright's contribution to Modern
Architecture we hope to convey to the reader the
quality of Sheldon Cheney's work.
The Modern Architect has entered a new era in
which glass transforms the old dream of yesterday
into present day reality. The ancient adage "People
who live in glass houses should not throw stones"
becomes at this time advice most sound. The pos-
sibilities of glass houses have developed to a re-
markable degree, until now- Frank Lloyd Wright
has created the apartment house beautiful, nearly
one quarter of which is glass. In a recent Chicago
exhibition Wright displayed his latest design, and
expressed his faith in glass in the following words—
"The machine has given to architects, in glass a new
material with which to work. Why not combine
glass with steel, the spider's web, spin the building
frame as an integument for crystal clearness—the
crystal held by the steel as a diamond is held in its
setting of gold—and make it the building itself?
Why are modern cities still modern imitations of
mediaeval strong-holds?"
In answer to America's acclaimation of his splen-
did achievement, he only answers, that to himself it
is surprising that glass has not been used extensive-
ly in our age, as a building material.
Frank Lloyd Wright has used glass in his build-
ings for a period of thirty years. It is characteristic
of his architecture to use the straight line and the
rectangular plane. This in itself points out the
initiative of the man who was a pupil of Lewis Sulli-
van; the Sullivan who expressed his genius in the
arch and the curve. Wright has always used color,
light and openness. He has concentrated windows
into large accented areas, contrasting his pleasing
effects with the older architecture of the deep, re-
cessed windows.
A city in glass and bronze is the most hopeful
and inspiring possibility of modern architecture. It
surpasses imagination to vision a City shining by
day. radiantly luminous by night. Buildings made

Is Chemical Warfare Humane?
The popular conception of the death raj' and of
the many other types of chemical warfare as the
most terrible and horrible of man's agents of de-
struction is rather strongly questioned in a recent
article by Professor Charles L. Parsons, Secretary
of the American Chemical Society.
Professor Parsons does not believe in the common
opinion that chemists of the world are making any
special attempt, as many people imagine they are, to
develop new forms of poison gas for the next war.
This false opinion is undoubtedly due to the tre-
mendous amount of sensational material which is
put out in reference to chemical warfare and which
has no real basis in fact. His view of the matter
is that chemistry is a much abused subject when
war methods are brought up and that its use is
greatly misunderstood.
Far from being the most terrible form of warfare
it is probably the most humane, strange as that
statement may seem to the outside observer. Al-
though the popular mind does not carry that im-
pression, its truth is demonsrated by facts. In
America, (iermany, France, and Kngland at the
close of the last great war, while 30 per cent of the
casualties came from gas, yet gas was responsible
for only 2 per cent of the death. Besides, it is al-
most universally admitted in military circles that
chemical methods will stop an army from crossing
a contested area more effectively and with less death
and suffering than will any other method.
All warfare is terrible and must be done away
with. But if we must have warfare then chemical
warfare is going to be the least terrible aspect of
it. The world certainly does not have a sound
enough basis for its condemnation of chemistry be-
cause of its part in war. Chemistry is really more
of a benefactor in time of war than a malefactor.
It prevents operations rather than slaughtering the
operators.
Opening the World's Fair
A most unique method has been devised for set-
ting the machinery of the 19.13 World's Fair at Chi-
cago in operation. The lights of this Exposition
will not be turned on by the President of the United
States nor by any other national or international
dignitary. They have all been relieved of this so-

cial responsibility. The star Arcturus has been as-
signed the task. It will be light from the heavens
that will start the mechanical illumination which
man has invented to dispel darkness and illuminate
the products of his creation. It has been calculated
that this star will swim into exact position at the re-
quired second. The giant Yerkes telescope at Wil-
liams Bav, Wisconsin, will be so turned that it will
receive the feeble light from this star which left for
this earth approximately forty years ago when the
World's Fair of 1893 was attracting large crowds of
people. The light after passing through the tele-
scope will be focused on a photo-electric cell causing
it to generate a feeble current which will be ampli-
fied to such a degree that it will transport itself
over the many miles of wire between Williams Bay
and Chicago and will be sufficient to throw the
switches of the illumination control board. When
the contacts of the switches touch each other, the
buildings of the Fair will be flooded with a myriad
of multi-colored lights. To the Engineer of today,
this intricate arrangement is just another hook-up.
It is, however, a striking demonstration. It makes
us pause and realize once again that we are living
in an "Age of Science and Engineering."
Museums for Early Inventions
There is an old agade that says, "seeing is be-
lieving". Educators have recognized this fact and
established laboratories in all oiir schools. A lab-
oratory course is always given to engineering stu-
dents to acquaint them with the characteristics and
design of new mechanisms. Yet when we learn
this about these machines, it is very seldom that we
try and find the inventions from which these ma-
chines evolved. If we were to become so deeply-
interested where—to what source could we go? It
is a difficult task to learn the characteristics of an
old machine from pure description alone. It is only
when we begin to seek out that we find what a
small number of old working models still exist to
which we are able to have access.
It was Dr. Osker von Miller, a famous consult-
ing engineer, of Munich who lirst recognized this
dilemma. Being a man of great influence, he dis-
cussed his plans with the influential men of (&gt;er-
many. It was not a great time before there arose
at Munich the Deutches Museum, as a result of
his labors. This museum is unique in that it con-
tains many working models of different types of
machines and experiments. The "Hands Off" sign
was thrown out the door when this museum was
open. A person is able to operate all the models
by himself. If they are such as to be beyond his
scope, the assistants of the museum will operate
them for him.
It is encouraging to find that this superb idea has
not been confined within the geographical limits of
Germany. The Henry Ford Museum at Dearborn
is intending to carry out this same plan. Here, we
will find the inventions of that ingenious American,
Thomas A. Edison, in working condition. Chicago
is slowly enlarging its Museum of Science and In-
dustry through the generous aid of the Rosenwald
gifts. New York and Philadelphia are now creat-
ing similar institutions. The world is still becom-
ing "Engineering Conscious".
Daylight Measured with New Device
Taking advantage of daylight, nature's inexpen-
sive source of illumination, by efficient use and
planning of windows, is made markedly easier for
engineers and architects by the development of a
simple means of predicting the amount of illumina-
tion produced by any window, developed at the
University of Michigan and published by the De-
partment of Engineering Research. The method
marks a distinct advance in the relatively new ap-
plied science of daylighting.
Measurements by the Michigan method, are
made with a simple protractor which determines
the angles at which light enters, and by means of a
series of prepared curves translates these into
terms of daylight under average conditions. Such
calculations are particularly useful on factory build-
ings, with windows in monitor and saw tooth roofs,
and to calculate the distribution of light within a
room where the problem is complicated by reflec-
tions and shadows. Architects may now predict
probable light strength and distribution, easily and
quickly before a building is erected by applying
the protractor to the plans.
Accuracy entirely sufficient for practical engi-
neering purposes is claimed for the new method,
and its simplicity makes it much more available than
any of the older methods, which because of their
complicated nature are almost useless except where
time and cost are of little importance. The system
was developed by Waclaw Turner-Szymanowski,
under the supervision of Professor II. II. Higbie.
who has conducted much research in the field of
daylighting, and is presented as one of the bulle-
tins of the Department of Kngineering Research.

Known from China to Ireland, and sought by

COLLEGE NOTES
Stephen $. At wood
Perhaps it would be a safe generalization to as-
sume that every student on the campus has at one
time or another wondered, whence came the tra-
dition that women must not, and shall not, enter the
front doors of the Union. From our own private
sources comes the news that it was more or less
due to the 1918 president of the
now defunct Student Council,
Stephen S. Attwood. However,
when asked to corroborate this
fact, the genial, yet reticent, Mr.
Attwood professed that memory
is at best an uncertain thing
and declined to commit him-
self. We do not think that he
will mind being "exposed", for
in fact it obligates us men to the
extent of a debt of gratitude.
Mr. Attwood was born in
Cleveland, Ohio, and there spent
the earlier part of his life. He
then enrolled in the University
of Michigan and his under-
graduate days seem to have
been at least busy. Besides
being on the Council, as stated,
he also played on interclass
teams and was class president
his junior term. Election to
Michigamua was inevitable, and
in 1918 came the degree of B.S.
in Mechanical Engineering.
The following year Mr. Att-!
wood served as an Ensign in the
Navy. He regretted that he could not lend flavor
to this episode by sinking a submarine or some-
thing else romantic, but we are sure that he would
have obliged had the opportunity presented itself.
In the spring of 1919 the construction depart-
ment of the Packard Motor Company engaged his
services, which terminated with them in October.
STEPHEN S. ATTWOOD
1920, so that he could return to the University to
serve as an instructor in electrical engineering. His
promotion to his present rank came in 1923.
Along the line of his work, Mr. Attwood is
especially interested in investigating the effects of
controlled surges on dielectrics, arcs, and cathode
ray oscilligraphy. On the last
_.^^^^^^^^^_ named subject he supervised the
"work which was reported in the
January, 1931, Technic, and at
present he is preparing a paper
for the A. I. E. E. on "Reignition
of Metallic A. C. Arcs in Air,"
in joint authorship with W. E.
Dow. He has also done work
for the Detroit Edison Company
in connection with natural light-
ning.
Mr. Attwood is in charge of
the Electrical Engineering de-
partment's standardization lab-
oratory, which serves the state
of Michigan in the same capacity
as does the Bureau of Stand-
ards the nation, and of the co-
operative course sponsered joint-
ly by the department and vari-
ous industrial concerns. He is
also a member of, and faculty
advisor to Tail Beta Pi, treasur-
er of the local chapter of Sig-
ma Xi. and a member of the
1 Junior Research Club.
There are times, however,
when the cloak of pedagogical dignity may be
brushed aside and we find revealed a more than
tolerable hand at golf and handball, a proficient con-
tract bridge exponent, and a "good fellow." Most
important of all, he is the father of a young son and
a baby daughter, of whom he is immensely, and
justly, proud.

A. I. Ch. E.
The University of Michigan chapter of the Amer-
ican Institute of Chemical Engineers is the or-
ganization of the student chemical engineers. It is
one of the many such bodies under the supervision
of the A. I. Ch. E., and exists to quite an extent
for the same purposes as
the parent institution.
That is,-it promotes the
advancement of chemi-
cal engineering knowl-
edge and the develop-
ment of its members. It
also aims to provide a
bond of common interest
and fellowship.
The membership is us-
ually over a hundred,
and hence the dues are
gratifyingly 1 o w . The
membership includes all
of the undergraduate
classes and also the
graduate. Meetings are
held at about two week
intervals, and the year
is traditionally ended
with a picnic which is
invariably a marked suc-
cess. The group is prom-
inently represented in
joint meetings with
other technical societies
and at all times spon-
sors events and move-
ments that are of inter-
est or value to chemical
has a grand time. The (&gt;pen House held last year
was helped a great deal by the exhibits and demon-
strations accountable to the chemical engineers.
Last, but not least, the chapter annually presents a
student membership badge to the sophomore who
has made the highest scholastic average for his
freshman year.
engineers.
The meetings include
lectures by speakers ob-
tained from the faculty
or through industrial
connections. These lec-
tures are of great value,
especially to the begin-
ning students, since they
lend perspective to the
relations between chem-
ical engineering and in-
dustry. The speakers
are always men of im-
portance in their fields
and are able to answer
most of the questions arising in the mind of the
student.
Among the other activities of the chapter one can
include the smokers that are held during the after-
noons of the important out-of-town football games.

In the
Spotlight
AI.USOX B. EVANS
Somehow we have always
liked Al Evans, but. in a devil-
ish mood, we pot him in a cor-
ner the other night and started
to hecome inquisitive about his
past. Al, like a true sportsman,
submitted to the end that the
readers of the Tr clinic may
likewise learn to become self-
made men.
"\Vell," quoth he, in tones suggesting great import to
his utterances, "I hail from Erie, Pa., and you can quote
me as saying that it's the greatest little town on earth."
At the same time lie affected a magnificent gesture and
sat down well pleased with himself. Unfortunately, this
seems to be a ritual with everyone that boasts of Erie as
his native soil, and as a result the man on the streets
doesn't quite know what to believe. Some people insin-
uate that the Krie Chamber of Commerce has hired out
the town as boosters, but elsewhere there are heard whis-
perings that Krie is an earthly Paradise. Hence we shall
take Al at his word.
Al must have led a wretched childhood, for his lament
is that school has always been his greatest curse. Grad-
uating at Central High School. (Sassafras at Tenth), he
figured prominently in dramatics and was a member of
many of the worthwhile school clubs. Hence, having ab-
Mirbtil most of the available honors, he decided to prove
that he was of fle&lt;h and blood, even as you and I, and
contented himself with playing on the third football team.
Seeking relief from the exacting nature of his studies.
Al. for a time, dabbed in photography. He still regrets
the fact that his interest waned after he had placed East-
man Kodak on a sound financial basis.
Entering the Engineering College in the fall of IQ2S.
Al bethought him of his lx&gt;oks and proceeded to make
Phi Eta Siema. At the same time he became involved in
politics, and seems to have developed a system that is a
winner. Last year he succeeded in foisting an especially
neat trick on an unsuspecting populace. After his having
coyly suggested that he was too busy for another office,
the day of elections blew around and there was Al on
two different caucus platforms for the same office, much
to the consternation of at least one group. It was hardly
legitimate cricket, but remembering that politics are just
so much fun. we think that was clever.
But success had by no means gone to our young man's
head. Business was still business to Al. and as a con-
sequence he was elected to Tan Beta Pi the fall of the
same vear. Besides being secretarv of the Honor Society
and chairman of the Engineering Council. Al acted as as-
sistant track manager. His spare time he devoted to as-
sisting in Chemistry 17 laboratory, (as he is a ChE.1.
and he is serving in the same capacity this year. Al is
also a De Molay and a memlxr of Theta Xi fraternity.
At one summing. Al is another g&lt;x&gt;d excuse for the
invention of—"a krholnr and a gentleman."
Transportation Club
In 1925 the need was
felt among the students
and some members of
the faculty for an organ-
ization that would bring
the two parties into a
closer union. It had to
be an organization that
would be technical in its
nature and still cover
many phases of the engi-
neering field. The ap-
peal of this organization
had to be as inviting to
the Civil Engineer as it
would be to the Mechan-
ical or the Marine. To
meet this work it was
decided to form a Trans-
portation Club since it is
the second largest indus-
try in the world. There
is no field of Engineer-
ing that it does not em-
body in some phase of
its operation. Life to-
day could not go on if it
were not for the
marvelous transportation
system that we have or-
ganized.
The Transportation
Club covers a wide va-
riety of topics through-
out its yearly discussion,
operation of railway sys-
tems, inland water-way
operation, public utili-
ties, etc. It has brought
before the engineering
body of the University
such men as the Hon-
orable John F. Stevens,
Chief Engineer of the
Panama Canal, Mr. Fitzgerald, President of the
Western Maryland Railroad.
The membership in the Club is open to all mem-
bers of the Engineering College. A small fee is
charged every year to pay for the necessary cleri-
cal work of the organization. It is one of the finest

opportunities offered to embryo-engineers to meet
men who are in prominence in their respective field.
Several times throughout the year smokers are held
and the faculty and students mingle with the guests
of the evening, everybody enjoying themselves.
This year the Transportation Club is endeavoring to
give to the student the same tine educational enter-
tainment that they have in the past.
Vulcans
Vulcans, the Senior engineering honorary society.
was founded in the year 1904, by the members of
that year's graduating class. The primary reason
for the founding of this society was to promote good
fellowship and to bring about a better acquaintance-
ship among the selected members of the Senior
Class.
In the years which have passed, the requirements
for membership in this society have become limited
to scholastic ability and to leadership and ability in
extra-curricular activities. The elections to this so-
ciety are made in the spring of each year and the
men selected are taken from the Junior Engineering
class. The number of men installed in this society
each year is limited to twelve. Klection to this so-
cietv is an incentive for every Junior to work for as
it is one of the highest honors which he can ob-
tain while at Michigan.
A. I.E.E.
The American Institute of Klectrical Kngineers
is the national organization representing the elec-
trical engineering profession, II has as its objects
the advancement of the theory and practice of elec-
trical engineering and of the allied arts and sci-
ences, the maintenance of a high professional stand-
ard among its members, and the development of
the individual engineer.
The University of Michigan Branch is one of
the Institute's 109 bronches established in promi-
nent technical schools throughout the country to
offer students the opportunity of becoming ac-
quainted with the organization, and to put them
in touch with the electrical engineering profession.
Last year the student membership of the Branch
was sixty men. most of whom were junior, senior
or graduate electrical engineering students. Dur-
ing the year eleven meetings and a banquet were
held. The meetings included many interesting lec-
tures by men from the electrical industry, and by
students who have had experience in various kinds
of electrical manufacturing and research. These
lectures proved to be valuable in giving the stu-
dent an understanding of the electrical industries
and the various types of work suitable for engineer-
ing graduates.
The A.I.R.K. banquet, which has become an an-
nual event, topped otY the year's program with a
spirited get-together of the entire electrical depart-
ment. Even the faculty, who were all present,
proved to know more tricks and jokes than one
would suspect. Many talks were given by students
and faculty, and a picture of Michael Faraday was
presented to the University. Dean Emeritus Morti-
mer E. Cooley provided the speech of the evening.
In addition to providing this instruction and en-
tertainment, the Branch offered employment oppor-
tunities to the graduating class by securing repre-
sentatives from four or five of the large electrical
companies to interview prospective employees.
Another activity was the engineering open house,
which was brought about through the efforts of the
A.I.E.E. One of the most popular features of the
open house was the interesting electrical show put
on by volunteer members of this organization.
Triangles-Junior Engineering Honorary
In a large group of young men such as the Fresh-
men and Sophomore classes of the Engineering Col-
lege, it is inevitable that some will apply themselves
more for the welfare of the group than others. Tri-
angles was formed to band this type of active stu-
dent together and give him some little distinction
for his earnest endeavors. The membership in this
organization is by invitation only. The new mem-
bers are elected to membership every spring from
the Sophomore class by the active men in the or-
ganixation. The new men are selected on the merits
of their curricular and extra-curricular activities.
The Triangles have performed a line mission in
the Engineering College. Always promoting fel-
lowship and good-will between the faculty and stu-
dents, they will carry on forever.

A.S.M.E.
The American Society of the Mechanical Engi-
neers was organized in New York in 1880 to pro-
mote the arts and sciences connected with engineer-
ing and mechanical construction. The founders of
this society were an association of professional me-
chanical engineers, manufacturers, and professors in
technical schools and colleges.
There are five grades of membership in this so-
ciety but the one of greatest interest to the students
of Mechanical Engineering is the student member-
ship. Anyone in good standing in this department
is entitled to join this society. It is the society's
policy to have meetings at regular intervals at which
some person of note in the Mechanical Engineering
profession will give a talk on some engineering
project.
The society has been quite active in the affairs
of the Engineering School and the most noteworthy
of these was the way in which its members re-
sponded to help make the Open House a success

•lames McNaugliton
Although he was never regularly graduated from
the University of Michigan as has been the case
with most of the men honored in this department of
the Technic, James MacKaughton has won such
outstanding success in his chosen field of endeavor
that any further overlooking of his position would
certainly seem unfair. Enthroned as unofficial
"King of the Michigan Copper Country" by the suc-
cessful accomplishment of the many difficult busi-
ness ventures into which he has
thrown himself, Mr. MacNaugh-
ton is undoubtedly as responsible
for the economic development of
the Northern Peninsula of the
State of Michigan as is any other
man. His political interests, his
civic improvement projects, and
his various community service op-
erations have so broadened the
field of his activities as to make
him even better known outside
than he is in the narrowed sphere
of the business world. It is cer-
tairily a pleasure to touch the high
spots of such an outstanding ca-
reer and to hold it up for the world
to review.
His business life began in 1886
when he accepted an invitation to
join the engineering department of
the largest copper mining corpora-
lion in the north, the Calumet and Hecla Mining
Company at Calumet. Michigan. The fact that he
gave up the opportunity of finishing his college ca-
reer at Michigan by dropping out of school at the
end of his sophomore year has not seemed to pre-
vent his becoming a figure of international im-
portance in the mining industry. A brief sketch
of his rise in the world of business will surelv
bring this out.
After working industriously for the Calumet
and Hecla Company for five years and absorbing
all of the technology of copper mining operations
JAMES McNAUGHTOX
that came his way, Mr. MacXaughton became a
full fledged Mining Engineer and joined the staff
of the Chapin Mining Company in that capacity.
From then on his rise was rapid, almost meteoric
in a field where the climb up to the top of the
ladder is usually slow and hard. Within the next
five years he was made Assistant Superintendent
and given charge over all operations in the field.
Next he acceded to the position of Superintendent
and General Manager, the respon-
sibilities of which he shouldered so
well that he was induced to re-
turn to the Calumet and Hecla
Company as General Superintend-
ent. He took over the manage-
ment of the latter company in 1901
and has been affiliated with it ever
since. His promotion has been
continuous since that time and, in
1926, after the giant merger of
copper mining concerns into the
great Calumet and Hecla Consoli-
dated Copper Company, he was
elected President of that corpora-
tion. He still holds this latter po-
sition, directing the activities of
what is probably the world's great-
est mining unit.
Scliolastically he has also pros-
pered, a fact which is shown con-
clusively by the many highly de-
served honorary awards which have been bestowed
upon his unassuming personality. In 1907, his old
alma mater, the University of Michigan, recognized
his attainments and granted him a Bachelor's De-
gree in Civil Engineering', dated 1888, an honor
which he had foregone by leaving college in 1886.
In 1930 an honorary Doctor of Science degree was
offered by the Michigan College of Mines and was
gratefully accepted by Mr. MacXaughton as his
University degree had been several years previous.
His political and civic ventures have consisted of
serving his community in the national party con-

ventions. Mr. MacNaughton was a delegate to the
National Republican Convention at St. Louis in
1896 and was a delegate-at-large to the conventions
of 1908 and 1928. The climax of this life of public
service came with the recent announcement that Mr.
MacNaughton has just been elected President of the
University of Michigan Club of Calumet, Michigan,
a fitting tribute to his sterling character and loyalty.
Without the least hint of restraint, we salute
James MacNaughton, University of Michigan engi-
neer, and toast to his continued success. Michigan
is proud of such a man as this.
Dear Alumnus:—Again the time has come to
make our monthly trip to all of the widespread sec-
tors of the world and visit our old schoolpals and
alumni friends. We have heard from a great many
of them during the past few weeks so drop your
dignity and come with me while we travel around
and say hello. Like Santa Claus with a great
many trips to make we had better cut remarks short
and get going or we won't be able to make the
rounds before we have to sign off for another
month. Let's give the older fellows the place of
honor on our calling list and drop in on them first.
1896
Our first name is that of an old friend who is
now located in the Motor City, transacting the
business of his class as its Secretary. After passing
the customary compliments we find out that Rich-
ard D. Ewing recently opened offices at 837 Penob-
scot Building, Detroit, Michigan, where he is selling
investment securities under the firm name of
Ewing-Patton Company. He reminds us that we
have promised to extend his greetings to all of
the vast "Alumni University" and we travel on.
1900
Out in Omaha, Nebraska, we run into another
one of the more prominent of the old "grads". W.
Richter Wood, District Sales Manager for the Mur-
phy Products Company, the son of a Michigan man
of the class of 1866 Engineers, says that he is thor-
oughly enjoying life out in the sunny prairie lands.
1903
Working away up in Canada, we run across
Stuart Sims, District Manager and Life Under-
writer for the Sun Life Insurance Company of
Canada, with offices in Portland and Corvallis.
Oregon. He has a lot to tell us, too, having car-
ried out various undertakings during the past few
years. In the line of engineering project work he
has done considerable designing and building, in-
cluding the erection of millions of dollars worth of
water-supply-and hydro-electric plants. His wan-
derings have also led him into the teaching profes-
sion to an appreciable extent. He confesses that
he spent the years from 1914-1927 as a faculty man,
being Associate Professor of Hydraulics at Iowa
University and Dean of the Department of Civil
Engineering at Oregon State College. His family
includes two sons and two daughters—"striking a
mean average" he calls it.
1907
Chattanooga, Tennessee, part of America's famed
Appalachian mountain country, is the home of Wor-
ley J. Brown, next on the visiting list. We are in-
formed by our old friend that he has been working
hard as general Sales Manager for the Penn-Dixie
Cement Corp. of Chattanooga. His residence ad-
dress is 116 Windmere Drive, located in one of
Chattanooga's most beautiful park suburbs. We
reiterate his emphasized statement that one could
hardly help enjoying life in such beautiful surround-
ings and move on.
1909
John Hunter Nead, chief metallurgist for the
American Rolling Mill Company at Middletown,
Ohio, is right at hand to welcome our call and
tell us a little about the way he has been spending
his time since leaving Ann Arbor and his college
chums. He confesses that he has been dabbling
in research and holds patents on several metallurgi-
cal processes. He is also the author of papers on
different phases of his field. He is living in Middle-
town at 402 The Almado Apartments, is married,
and has a daughter seven years old.

Away off in an out of the way corner of the
Southland we discover Nelson L. Van Tol, who
is industriously practicing his engineering profes-
sion in Fairfield, Alabama. His official title, which
must be rattled off in one breath to give the full
effect, is Assistant General Superintendent of the
Fairfield Steel Works of the Tennessee Coal, Iron,
and Railroad Company. He says he has a good
job, a good location, and good health so why
shouldn't he be happy.

TECHNICAL NOTES
ELECTRIC EYE TO SORT MAIL FOR UNCLE
SAM IN RAILROAD TERMINALS
The photo-electric relay is the unerring eye of a
robot railway mail sorter, in the functioning of a
new type of equipment developed recently. This
equipment, designed to be of great help in railroad
terminals, will automatically route sacks of mail to
the proper railroad cars.
Kach sack is loaded with mail for one city. When
the sack is full, it is placed in a tray container which
travels on an automatic conveyor system of the
overhead monorail type. The containers are made
up into '"trains" pulled along at about five miles an
hour by a motor-driven carrier, as many as 50 con-
tainers making up a train. The little mail train has
for its destination a number of railway mail cars,
each going to a different city. As the train goes by,
the mail sacks are automatically sorted and dropped
on the loading platform near the proper railway
cars.
An ingenious arrangement of photo-electric re-
lays is the basis of this sorting. On each mail bag
tray conveyor are a photo-electric relay and solenoid
mechanism which travel along the conveyor with
the tray. The photo-electric tube, when actuated by
a beam of light, causes the relay to release the mail
sack by means of the solenoid mechanism.
The setting of the photo-electric equipment takes
place at the dispatching platform, immediately after
loading. The dispatcher, as the mail passes him on
the conveyor, inspects the destination tag on each
sack and sets the relay equipment accordingly. In
order to allow the operators plenty of time for load-
ing and dispatching, an automatic arrangement of
control slows down the conveyor at that point,
speeding it up again after leaving.
ELECTRIC STEAM GENERATORS WITH
A VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS
Electric steam generators for application any-
where in industry where steam is needed but is not
available in sufficient quantities or at suitable pres-
sure was recently introduced. The line includes two
pressure ratings—100 and 200 pounds—in various
sizes and electrical ratings.
Many applications are listed for this equipment
by the manufacturer, including: aerofin heaters,
atomizing oil for oil burners, candy kettles, cavity
vulcanizers (tires), coil-forming presses, core vul-
canizers (tires), curing celluloid products, dental
vulcanizers, dish washers, dry cleaners' hat tables,
electrolene producers, gluepots, glue cookers, heat
treating aluminum castings, Hoffman pressing ma-
chines, hotplate warmers, hot water tanks, humidi-
fying for incubators, humidifying for libraries, hu-
midifying for silk manufacturing, hydraulic vulcan-
izing presses, impregnating tanks, lye pots, matrix
tables, milk trucks, oil tanks, ovens, paraffin tanks,
pasteurizing tanks, pickle tanks, plate-bending rolls,
puff irons (dry cleaning) ; steam tables, steam baths,
steam cleaning, steam heat (college buildings,
dairies and powder plants), soup kettles, sterilizing,
vegetable steam cookers, water pots, wax pots, wax
rolls, wax tables, bread-making ovens, electric fur-
naces for bright annealing copper, humidifiers for
air conditioning, automobile washing machines,
marcelling parlors, evaporating plants, automobile
cleaners, paint-stripping machines, wallpaper re-
moving, circus cook wagons, shoe repairing and
shoemaking, rubber machines, rotogravure presses,
steam dryers, hosier}- mills, feather curling, steaiii-
ing bristles, drying varnishes, steaming nap of tex-
tiles, portable steam tables for hotels and restau-
rants, and laboratory steam generators.
The advantages of such equipment include the
following: no stacks or flues required; completely
automatic operation obtainable (no necessity for
firemen or engineer) ; can be built into the device to
be heated eliminating piping and radiation losses;
low maintenance quick heating—usually much
faster than a fuel-fired boiler; no fuel storage or
space for same required; no fumes or combustion;
hence better working conditions; no ashes to be re-
moved, hence no dust; compact—can be mounted
on ceiling, side wall or floor; reduced fire hazard
and lower rate of insurance—no conflict with build-
ing or underwriters' codes; economical in operation;
low-water explosion hazard eliminated; very accur-
ate temperature control—within 2 or 3 degrees F;
steady load at unity power-factor, and units meet
specifications of A.S.M.K. boiler-construction code.
LIZARDS AND LINEMEN
Designing engineers endeavor to take into ac-
count all kinds of conditions and predicaments that
might cause trouble in the operation of electric
equipment, but they never gave a thought to liz-
ards—and so trouble has developed in the Philip-
pine Islands, according to word received from there
by the International General Klectric Company.
At least, one lineman there suddenly found him-
self on the ground, knocked ofT a pole by a shock re-
ceived from a transformer he had disconnected from
the power supply. A lizard caused his fall, but the


Page Twenty-Three
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
lizard will not make the trick ;i habit—its shucking
experiment was fatal to it.
So that pole-type transformers can he discon-
nected from the power supply while being serviced,
a cutout is mounted adjacent to it on a cross-arm of
the pole. The cutout is in a small, weatherproof
hox, with a hole in the bottom to insure proper
drainage of any condensed moisture. Within the
box are heavy-duty cartridge-type fuses for discon-
necting the circuits.
The hole in the bottom of the box was the trou-
ble-causer. Lizards formerly sought bark crevices
and holes in trees as safe, quite, comfortable and
homey surrounds for their afternoon siestas.
Came progress, and the erection of wooden poles.
Inquisitive lizards inspected, approved, and mi-
grated. Homes were established in the cutouts.
Came an unsuspecting lineman. The whole liz-
ard family was away when he opened the cutout
and made the transformer safe for the work he was
about to do. But one of the reptiles strolled back
for its afternoon nap. It crawled into the cut-out
box, and stretched and yawned as a preliminary to
curling up in blissful slumber. It attained the bliss-
ful slumber it sought, but the slumber was perpet-
ual—in its yawnful stretch, it swung its tail against
the upper contact while it rested its chin on the
lower one of the open cutout. Whereupon the cir-
cuit was completed, the life of the lizard was com-
pleted, and the electric lineman was electrical'y pre-
cipitated ground ward.
It is understood that cutouts in the Philippines
and other lizard-populated countries will have small
wire screens across the drainage holes. Eviction
notices have been issued—bark crevices and holes
in trees will again be proper havens for tired lizards. o

is impossible at velocities above about 0.6 of the
velocity of sound.
Mention has already been made of the use of the
wind tunnel in experimental work in aerodynamics.
Originally wind tunnels were built rather small in
size and operated at relatively low wind-speeds so
that the Reynolds numbers obtained for the models
tested were much lower than those existing in
actual flight. It has long been known that this
"scale effect", as it is called, produces considerable
differences between the model and full size results
for the forces acting on a body moving through the
air. Consequently it has become important to carry
out these tests at values of the Reynolds number
comparable with those obtained in free flight. In
the United States this problem is being attacked in
two ways by the National Advisory Committee for
Aeronautics. At the Langley Memorial Laboratory
a large 20 foot diameter wind tunnel has been re-
cently completed for experimental work on full-
scale propellers and in it many airplane parts can
be tested full size. Previous to this a variable
density tunnel was constructed which consists of
a tube enclosed in a large tank in which the pres-
sure can be varied from atmospheric to twentv
times that value. Since the Reynolds number is
inversely proportional to the kinematic coefficient of
viscosity, which in turn varies inversely as the
density of the air, very high values may thus be
obtained. In this tunnel values in the neighbor-
hood of 3,500,0000 have been reached, while in an
ordinary atmospheric tunnel such as is in operation
at the University of Michigan, the maximum value
obtainable is around 80,000. An airplane with a
5 foot wing chord flying at 100 miles per hour
would give a value of this characteristic of 4,600,000.
At the present time a similar tunnel is being con-
structed at the National Physical Laboratory in
Teddington. England. This tunnel is larger and is
designed to operate at higher velocities and pres-
sures than the American tunnel, so the Reynolds
number may be nearly twice that obtained in the
latter. In France, the Service Technique de I'Aero-
nautique is also planning to build a large size at-
mospheric tunnel of elliptical cross-section. With
this new and more elaborate experimental equip-
ment available, it is expected that a'great deal of
valuable information will be disclosed concerning
problems in the flow of fluids which are related to
aeronautics.

The American Society of Civil Engineers is tin-
oldest National Engineering Society in the United
States. It was instituted in 1852 for the purpose of
advancing engineering and architectural knowledge
and practice, maintaining a high professional stand-
ard among its members, encouraging intercourse be-
tween men of practical science, and establishing "a
central point of reference and union for its mem-
bers".
The student chapter, composed of Junior and
Senior Civil engineering students and a limited num-
ber of outstanding sophomores, is the only one of
the Engineering Societies on the campus having
scholarship requirements for membership. Bi-
weekly meetings are held, alternate meetings being
dinner meetings at the Union. Usually the after
dinner speeches are given by faculty members of the
various schools on the campus. Illustrated lectures
on topics of engineering interest are given by stu-
dent members at the business meetings.

Beam Test
A type of concrete beam suitable for a variety
of building purposes has been developed by a Kala-
inazoo inventor and tested with successful results
under the direction of Professor F. X. Menefee of
the engineering mechanics department.
The beams are made by a process which com-
bines casting, as concrete is usually made, and
rolling, as steel is made. The material is poured
into a hopper from which it is fed into the lower
portion of a form shaped like the half section of an
I beam, which, in turn, moves under a set of rollers
which shape the other half and subject the whole to
a great pressure. The new product is 30 per cent
lighter than common concrete, which facilitates
transportation and erection of the beams. Besides
being cast and rolled as beams the new concrete
may also be made into a variety of sections for
building, to be assembled on the construction site
into houses and buildings.

The Mentor System
Continued fnnn page &lt;;
students do not even know who their Class Mentor
is.
After the completion of the freshman year the
men are departmentalized, that is, they come un-
der the supervision of the department whose course
they are pursuing. In reality, sophomores and
juniors have no tangible connections with their re-
spective departments until their senior year. They
are left to shift for themselves and allowed to come
through as best they can.
There is only one solution to this aggravating sit-
uation. A Mentor System similar to that now used
in connection with the freshmen must be organized.
Kach Mentor should have a small group of men who
are in his own department. In this manner the man
and his adviser will have first of all. a common in-
terest. The Mentor would be in possession of the
aforementioned information concerning each man
and so be of real assistance to him. The question
of marks is not so important in the case of the up-
perclassmen as they are better judges of just how
they stand than freshmen are. One report a semes-
ter submitted to the Mentors by the instructors
would be sufficient.
Viewing the system from an entirelv different
angle, namely, the advantages which can be de-
rived from it by the members of the faculty con-
nected with the Mentor System, one may easily see
that several rather desirable conditions will result.

student is created. Because of this the instructor is
able to learn whether or not he is doing properly
what is expected of him. He is in a position to re-
ceive sincere suggestions for improvement from the
men he is in charge of and if the idea is good but
not practical in some particular situation, he can ex-
plain why that idea is not being used. These are
but a few specific examples of an infinite number
of advantages. It is suggested for obvious reasons
that as many members of the faculty as are willing
to do this sort of work, be incorporated into the ex-
isting system.
The success of the present Mentor System has
been effectively demonstrated. It has reached that
state of development which warrants the extension
of the idea into the upper classes. The structures
of the Mentor System has been so designed that it
may easily be enlarged to include the entire student
body of the College of Engineering.

for this help. When this was over he lent his ef-
forts to aid another such man with his problem—
and so on. \
The answer is just this, that little by little the
head of his section came to know that he had passed
on an idea here and an idea there, had helped on
this particular problem and then on that one. It
was always the same story—this one man was in-
terested in others and their jobs as well as his own,
was encouraging his fellow workers, and was con-
stantly suggesting aids to the solution of their prob-
lems. He came to be regarded as the unofficial con-
sultant of that department, which soon became a
reality by appointment and promotion. Today he
is a consulting engineer for his company in a gen-
eral capacity and is recognized as an outstanding
engineer. This instance is cited without further de-
tail for its object lesson and the bearing on our own
subject is evident.

Marquette. Michigan, is the next stop, the home
of Donald M. Begole, an old "Michigan Man" and
the present Vice-President and General Manager
of the Lake Shore Engine Works of Marquette.
After a few moments friendly chat we find out that
life is not all sunshine up in the mining districts.
Snow is the password and hard work the order

Our visit to New England includes Watertown,
Connecticut, so we stop off long enough to chat a
few moments with Willard S. Girvin, metallurgist
for the American Brass Company. We find him
living contentedly with his wife and two sons on
Highland Avenue. He has nothing of especial in-
terest to tell us since life has not been treating him
extraordinarily, but he does want us to say hello
to all of his friends for him.
The Chief Engineer for the Huron Portland Ce-

emphasis on his statement that he is always at
home to any of his old school pals, either by mail
or in person. His residence address is 442 State

Buying, selling, and trading boats of all kinds
and descriptions is the present occupation of an-
other of our old "grads", Dick B. Gardner. He and
his brother, Jack '21, are in the business as partners
and are now operating in the district of Benton
Harbor, Michigan, and surrounding territory. Dick
frequently wonders why he hears so little about the
whereabouts of his former classmates and invites
his old friends to get in touch with him again.
But don't get into the boat business if you want
to get rich quick, he advises. We'd like to linger
with such an engaging correspondent, but we must
move along to our other calls.
In keeping track of Clarence T. Fishleigh, we
discover that he has just recently changed his
address, moving from Wilmot, Illinois, to Detroit.
Michigan, where he is located at 16653 Lilac Street.
He is at present associated with his brother, Walter,
of the class of 1906 Engineer, in consulting engi-

YOU EVERY ADVANTAGE OF
OXWELDING AND CUTTING
IN planning a new metal product
or improving an old one, Linde
Process Service places at the dis-
posal of Linde users an unparalleled
knowledge of the oxy-acetylene
process of welding and cutting. This service effectively supplements the
work of your own engineers in obtaining maximum design advantages,
production economies, and complete dependability. Typical examples of
Linde Process Service include —
Assistance to a manufacturer in remaking a broken cast iron generator
yoke on an urgently fast schedule. This unit was redesigned for fabrica-
tion from oxy-acetylene shape-cut steel by welding.
Cooperation with another manufacturer in designing for welded pro-
duction a steel forming press. Dependability was achieved at exceptionally
low cost through the use of oxy-acetylene shape-cut steel.
Helping an aircraft builder design a "hot spot for fuel heating. The
necessary compactness of this device could be obtained only by oxwelding.
Lightness without sacrifice of strength was essential.
Tomorrow's engineers will be expected to know how to apply the oxy-acetylene
process of welding and cutting metals. For their assistance, we have prepared several
interesting technical booklets explaining how this modern metal-working process is
used in the design, construction, and fabrication of metal parts and structures. These
books contain newer and more practical material than most texts and will form a helpful
addition to your personal library. Write to us and we will send them to you without charge.

THE new electron tube, the Thyratron, is
the most versatile servant developed in
recent years. Already it has a host of applica-
tions. It will open windows, count anything
that will interrupt a beam of light, operate
welding machines, sort beans or buttons, oper-
ate drinking fountains as you bend over them,
light buildings, windows, and theaters, and
measure the intense heat of furnace interiors.
And it has a thousand other applications.
Thyratron control has made possible high-
speed welding machines, for no contactor-
actuated resistance welder can approach the
speed of several hundred interruptions per
minute that are required. High-current Thyra-
trons interrupt the current in the welding trans-
formers and swing the impedance from high
to low, the welding rate depending on the
speed of these changes. Thyratron control can
be used for as many as one thousand interrup-
tions per minute.
The name Thyratron comes from a Greek word
which means "door". Not only does this
tube act as a door, or valve, for electricity,
but some scientists say that its possibilities are
so great that its use will revolutionize the
electrical industry. If these predictions are
correct, the Thyratron is an open door of
opportunity for young men now in college
and for graduates already in the employ of
the General Electric Company.

For many years, Bell System men
have been working out ideas to increase
the use and usefulness of the telephone.
For example, they prepared plans for
selling by telephone which helped an

business from $1,000,000 to $5,500,000
—a wholesale grocer to enlarge his vol-

a soap salesman to sell $6000 worth of
goods in one afternoon at a selling cost
of less than 1 % \
This spirit of cooperation is one rea-

When Science Comes of Age
By Amos R. Morris, Asst. Professor of English
IN common law one comes to years of discretion
in half the time he comes of age. The sciences
are today only in the adolescent stage of normal
development, full of conceit, a bit bumptious and full
of vigor, a bit out of control. If the sciences stalk
through our academic shades
with something of a swagger,
with boundless energy undi-
rected, a bit callow, a bit con-
fused, with a bit of fuzz on
the upper lip, it is an oc-
casion not for resentment, but
for hope; the youth is grow-
ing up and will, in the nor-
mal course of things, soon
come of age.
When science captures a
philosophy it is past its salad
days. When it turns its atten-
tion to the relation of its own
activity to the larger concerns
of human life, then science is
past its growing pains. When
the physicist chases the elusive
atom to his lair, not to do him
to death, but only to examine
his vertebrae and classify him
in the right category, then
physics is growing up. When
the mathematician juggles his
formulae to find, not only how-
to design girders and arches to
stand a given tension and
strain, but also to insure as cer-
tainly an aesthetic sense of the
fitness of things, then mathe-
matics is rapidly coming of
age. Wrhen the end sought by science is not the
self-development of each branch but the integration
of all into a larger unity, an ultimate complete in-
tegration of the sciences and the arts, then both
The Discobulus
the sciences and the arts are coming to maturity
and man is coming at last to human stature.
Four stages in the development of a science are
rather definitely marked. First it concerns itself
chiefly with the mastery of its own material; it is
largely absorbed in technique.
This is where most of the ener-
gies of our natural sciences are
directed today. With a degree
of mastery attained in that, the
science concerns itself with re-
lationship to other sciences,
with an integration of laws and
systems; physics and chemis-
try are there now and biology
is in the offing. The third
stage as marked by the cap-
ture or development of a phi-
losophy to explain the larger
unity of law seen to operate
through all; physics is doing
something here, biology a bit,
and mathematics a great deal.
The fourth stage, full matur-
ity, is reached when science
turns its mastery of material
law to an interpretation of art,
to an understanding of those
things by which the spirit lives,
to making life a richer and full-
er experience. Something like
that seems to have happened
once in human history; there is
reason to believe a second day
is breaking. The first day
came through philosophy; the
second doubtless will come
through the natural sciences.
In architecture the structural engineer is no long-
er interested only in seeing how high he can push
a building toward the clouds but in how comely


coarse and heavy masses of concrete structure we
are coming to be interested in something beyond
strength and durability. Just as music has had,
since the days of Pythagoras, the laws of its beauty
rather thoroughly understood, so architecture is
coming to spell out fumblingly the alphabet by
which the laws of its beauty are expressed. With
music at one end of the spectrum of the fine arts
and architecture at the other, both operating by
known laws seen as the identical law operating in
different mediums, the other arts—even literature—
may be intelligently approached. It is a fascinating
thing to dream of. There is still some reason why
a lover of the arts should stave off the undertaker.
The building arts have never been entirely with-
out mathematical law. A carpenter without enough
arithmetic to work out a simple proportion could
.still saw a rafter by the 9x12 rule of the square
to get the pitch of the colo-
nial roof represented by the
simple relations of the right
triangle 3, 4, 5. A few sim-
ple ratios have become stock
in trade for both lines and
spaces. In determining ele-
mentary relations of lines,
ratios of 1:2, 2:3, 3:4, 5:7
are handled with some ease
and confidence. Ratios of
surfaces are less confidently
handled. It is not yet quite
clear how far one can lean
upon the mathematical rela-
tion of root squares to give
a pleasing effect to surface
spaces or curved lines. Lit-
tle has been done to inte-
grate what we might call the
static ratios dominating the fundamental dimen-
sions of a building with what we might call the dy-
namic ratios motivating the details. Even the ex-
istence of the two motives is not generally recog-
nized. For instance, the reason why the Royall
garden doorway is right, is easily seen; it has not
been equally clear why the Greek volute capping
the pilaster is also good for another reason. It
has not been generally clear that the main lines,
marked by simple arithmetical ratios suggest sta-
bility, completion, permanence while the details
of the capital suggest growth, evolution, a becom-
ing. We have in Ann Arbor several examples of
this style with the capital a segment of an en-
veloping circle. It is certainly no accident that
the central feature of the door-way of Lane Hall
seems instantly right nor that the door-way of the
Health Service building or of the Jones School
on Pivision street seems instantly wrong. All
The Scroll of Archimedes
three use the same motive in design; one succeeds
and two fail. Wre all, I suppose, agree upon the fact
though we may not have stopped to ask why.
In the same way we should all agree that the
scroll of the capital of the large column set up in the
court of the architectural college is wrong; there
would be a tolerably general agreement upon why
it is wrong. The ratio of its evolution is static
whereas it should be dynamic. The ratio of the
radius vector of succeeding whorls is approxi-
mately an arithmetical series of the scroll of
Archimedes; to give the effect of evolving form
of inherent power it should have a ratio of radius
vectors forming a logarithmic series. That this
is the inherent nature of growth and the ele-
mentary rule for the Tightness of the Greek volute
is seen in the form of the shell of the gastropods
and of the volute of the Ionic capital when it seems,
by common consent, to be right.
In sculpture, where the re-
lationships are rather more
subtle than in architecture,
there is not the same meas-
ure of agreement either upon
the dominating motive or
upon the basic ratios.
Where form is the prime
interest, as in the case of the
body at rest, a static ratio
gives approximately the cor-
rect effect; where the sense
of movement is the center
of interest it is clear that the
relations are dynamic. The
'feeling" for the form in both
instances is not, of course, a
personal matter of lawless
subjectivity; both "feelings"
are doubtless dominated by
laws as inexorable as the law of falling bodies. The
Apollo Belvidere can be explained with approxi-
mate satisfaction upon the basis of the simple
arithmetical ratios of the Greek canon as under-
stood by Vetruvius. But it is perfectly obvious
that an equally satisfactory explanation of our
pleasure in the Discobulus of Myron must be
based upon subtler relationships than that. That
D. R. Hay's rules based upon angles is near to it
is suggested by the effect of perpendicular lines
cutting fulcrum points and centers of successive
pivoting. But an adequate explanation, when we
finally have it, will probably be based upon a
logarithmic series involving root squares.
In literature, the finest of the fine arts because
it is richest in its integrations, both static and dy-
namic ratios probably interplay in the most intri-
cate fashion. In this rich field science has scarce-

Associate Professor of Railroad Engineering
E'ENS are a particular form of property right,
and, generally speaking, have developed as
security to the creditor for some obligation
growing out of a business relation. Historically,
the lien has been of long standing, and the records
of court actions of a century or two ago are re-
plete with examples wherein creditors claim lien
rights. These early examples deal with personal
property rights, the creditor exercising the right to
retain possession of the property until the debt is
paid. Thus, the innkeeper would retain possession
of the guest's baggage until the hotel bill was paid;
so, also, the retention of a ship for repair bills; or
the retention of goods in a warehouse until the
storage bill was paid.
The common-law encouraged the exercise of
liens, this so-called "right of possession", as a
means of getting accounts settled. And rightly
so, for this form of self-help relieved the con-
gested courts of considerable business. Stated
briefly, then, the common-law lien was a right of
possession of personal property, developed as a se-
curity for the creditor. Since it is necessary to have
actual possession of the property before the lien
could be applied, the common law restricted the ap-
plication of the lien to personal property. The
lien of itself did not grant to the creditor the priv-
ilege of sale or use of the personal property, but
merely the right of retaining possession until the
debtor paid the bill.
Due to the number of different parties entering
into a present-clay transaction, modern business is
materially more complex than in the old days of
barter and trade. This is particularly so in the
case of large engineering projects. From this sit-
uation has developed a necessity for liens against
real property. For instance, a lumber company
sells a large order to a contractor to be used in the
construction of a warehouse. The lumber is used
in the erection of the building, becoming a part of
the warehouse and thereby changing from personal
property to real property. If the contractor should
fail to pay the mill for the lumber, the lumber com-
The
Lawyer's
Club
pany would have no immediate relief. Legislatures
of the various states have therefore passed "me-
chanics lien laws" which take care of the material-
men and mechanics in their claims for services per-
formed and material furnished in any "improvement
of real property." These statutes are so con-
structed as to protect the land owner or his grantee,
from the difficulty of paying twice, first to the con-
tractor, and again on the lien to the materialmen
or the mechanic.
It should be remembered that the statutes must
be interpreted according to the probable intent of
the legislature, each borderline case being sub-
jected to this regular test. For instance, a statute
may state that a mechanics lien is good for labor
and material used in the improvement of land, and
an engineer or architect seeks a lien for preparing
plans and supervising the erection of the new build-
ing. Courts hold, correctly, that these technical
services were used on the project just as much as
the mason's or carpenter's efforts, and that a lien
will be good. The difficulty arises where the engi-
neer has prepared plans, but the structure is never
erected. In this case the issue is raised whether
the preparation of the plans is 'a service performed
for the improvement to the land, and the weight of
authority holds that the services performed will not
support a lien. This is a reasonable rule in that the
land is not actually improved.
The statutes provide that the material actually
placed in the building will support a lien on the
property improved. The installation of a steam
heating or ventillating plant would be of this na-
ture. There are some borderline cases, however,
which require a judicial interpretation of the legis-
lative intent in the statute. For instance, form
lumber for concrete work may be entirely de-
stroyed during the construction of a building. This
material does not remain as a part of the finished
building, yet a lien on the building for its unpaid
purchase price would be good. If the lumber is not
consumed, it would raise the issue whether the life

ELECTRICITY IN
TRANSIT
By STANLEY C. KILLIAN, '34E.E.
The Latest Type of Tower

REAMS have been written about the wonders
of the modern electric generating plants;
about the marvels of the gigantic generators,
of the boilers and turbines, of the marvelous method
of control, of many items in the power house, and of
the power house itself. But it often happens that,
on the large, the energy is forgotten after it is gen-
erated, and the distribution systems, which cover
the country like enormous spider webs, are disre-
garded. Without these, our highly efficient electri-
cal systems would be far behind their high, present
day status. It is interesting to note that this high
plane of electrical development and service has been
accomplished almost entirely in the past two dec-
ades.
Today we find electricity being generated at gi-
gantic central stations and distributed by means of
a net-work of transmission lines together with
switching stations and transformer substations.
The energy is transmitted at enormously high pres-
sures, a number of 220,000 volt systems now being
in use. Systems employing 154,000 volts and
132,000 volts are common.
Almost all systems are tied in with their neigh-
boring systems. The benefits derived from this
high tension, linked system of distribution are
manifold. First, last, and always is the ever present
need of economy and efficiency, especially in this
day and age. On leaving the power house, the volt-
age is stepped up by means of transformers, if not
already at a sufficiently high pressure, and sent out
on transmission lines. Some of these lines, extend-
ing for hundreds of miles across the country on
their high towers, challenge the imagination, for the
evenly spaced towers and gently curved cables,
pulled from one tower to the other, seem to the ob-
server to stretch on forever. The benefits of step-
ping the voltage up are several. As the voltage is
raised the amperage is lowered which results in an
immense saving in energy losses for long distance
lines. Smaller wire is also required to transmit the
same amount of energy. Often the power source,
water power for example, is far removed from the
power market, again necessitating long distance
transmission.
Before the systematized 'method of electrical dis-
tribution, each town and hamlet had its own gener-
ating plant, if it was of sufficient size to have any
at all. Often these were operated only twelve to six-
teen hours a day, leaving their customers without
the use of electricity from morning to evening.
Breakdowns were not infrequent and it often hap-
pened that a community would be without electric
service for hours or even days at a time. Now the
effective interconnections of all neighboring sys-
tems allows a transfer of energy in a few minutes
from one territory to the territory where the break
clown has occurred. Service is continuous and the
smallest town, as well as the great city, has an elec-
trical servant at its command twenty-four hours a
day. The flow of electricity is very rarely inter-
rupted, as any one accustomed to the present grade
of service knows. The farmer, too, now can depend
upon his electricity, where heretofore, he had none
at all. Also, isolated projects such as quarries and
mines, can not enjoy the advantages offered by this
system.
The economy of this is at once apparent besides
its wonderful utility. One new gigantic generating
station now literally replaces hundreds of small gen-
erating plants. The equipment in these small plants
was very often not of the best or most efficient type,
the selection of material being limited by the cir-
cumscribed means of the community. Five or six
men at least were required to keep the station in
working order. Now but a very small percentage
of the total number of men are required in the pres-

neat and sightly substation at each town or factory
has replaced the old plant. Depreciation and tip-
keep on transmission lines and substations are com-
paratively very small. Finally, there is the eco-
nomic transfer of energy between two systems. If
two systems have a peak load at different times, an
economic transfer of energy can be effected, there-
by reducing the total generating capacity, if the two
systems were operated separately.
There is much engineering, planning, and fore-
sight required in building a new transmission line.
The land over which the new line is to be run must
be bought and here the cost of the land must be
considered as well as the most convenient way of
running the lines. In some measure the future load
centers will determine the laying out of the line. A
recent trend has been to construct high tension lines

factory, ready to be bolted together. The cost of
along the rights of way of the railroads. Since rail- each one is materially reduced because of the large
ways were built before the present day towns and
farms, they are in almost all cases, a direct con-
nection between sizeable towns and sometimes the
only available approach to the heart of a large city.
This is an advantage, and besides, the utility coin-
scale manufacture which is possible. There are
hundreds of towers on each line, each one made ex-
actly alike, and often each individual tower has a
number of pieces which are alike. This not only
makes the manufacture cheaper but makes the in-
pany constructing the line has only one group to stallation much more rapid and economical. A good
deal with in securing the rights to build on. Ordi-
narily when the line is just run across the country,
many parties must be dealt with before the right of
way is secured. Then, of course, there is the nat-
ural conservation of land which results from using
the same strip of land for more than one purpose.
Just as the railroads now take advantage of their
"air rights" in the large cities by building immense
buildings over their stations, so they will be using
their "air rights" on the track itself, by allowing the
utilities to build high-tension lines over these tracks.
With the electrification of railroads now going for-
ward in earnest, the possibility also presents itself
of combining the transmission tower with the struc-
ture which supports the trolley wire. This effects
another major saving.
The transmission tower for transmitting the high-
er voltages is a very neat looking structure. It is

The pulling of cable is also done rapidly, tractors
being used in most cases.
There is a certain thrill of satisfaction in work-
ing on and completing a transmission line, for its
long distance and far-reaching feeling can be dupli-
cated only in road or railroad building. The line
worker is on the job in almost any kind of weather
and one must be a bit heartier than the ordinary
run of manhood to stand the rigorous routine. It
has been the writer's privilege to meet and work
with many of these line gangs and those construct-
ing outdoor substations, and a more rough and
ready, slam-bang, hale-well-met, reacly-to-do-their-
work-crew is not to be found anywhere.
In the outdoor substation of today, which is
the small town's only visible replacement of the
old generating plant, we find the equipment nec-
essary to step the voltage clown low enough
so that it can be sent out through the streets of
the town for distribution. This substation con-
sists of a neat appearing, galvanized steel struc-
ture on which the necessary equipment is
mounted. Usually a control house is built be-
side the substation. The substation structure
is also fabricated at the factory and can be
erected in a minimum time. The electrical
equipment required is varied and diversified in
character. First there are the required switch-
ing devices for disconnecting the line from the
substation; for tying the substation in with
other systems ; for transferring the energy from
one buss to another, in case one fails; for dis-

EVEN in a small city like Ann Arbor an archi-
tect can find many buildings worthy of study;
if the following survey is limited to examples
of the architectural use of ferro-concrete, it is be-
cause some of them may have remained unnoticed.
The concrete ceilings in the vestibule and lobby
of the Intramural Sports Building are fine specimens of
painted concrete surfaces. The soffits of the coffers
clearly exhibit concrete texture but the beams were
treated in such a manner as to cause doubt whether
they are veneered with wood or represent a clever
imitation. Actually they too are exposed concrete;
the close resemblance to wood which was achieved
violates the law of sincerity which has been so fine-
ly postulated in Ruskin's "Seven Lamps of Archi-
tecture". Those who condemn painting stucco to
imitate marble will also desire that concrete be
painted with any color except the brown of wood.
The architects, Messrs. Smith, Hichman and Grylls
kindly sent the below description of the technique
employed by them in this ceiling, as well as in the
Savoyard and University Clubs of Detroit:
"The forms for the concrete beams were built
with special care; pieces with a marked grain and of
sufficient length to cover the beam without un-
necessary joints were chosen; the intersections of
beams were mitred so as to avoid end grain show-
ing. The rough sawn lumber (which had been sat-
urated several times so as to raise the grain) was
oiled. The concrete mix was given extra attention
while pouring by careful puddling or spading to
make sure that no voids or dry spots would de-

velop. After the proper set, the forms were re-
moved with care so as to avoid damaging the im-
pression of the wood made by the raised grain.
When thoroughly dry, the beams were painted with
two coats of a light colored paint, and a third coat
of a darker color which was wiped lightly with a
cloth so as to remove the darker paint from the
raised portions. The proceedure is quite simple,
but it requires care and sympathy on the part of the
workmen".
The last statement is valid for the architectural
treatment of concrete in general: lack of care and
'sympathy cause the disagreeable concrete surfaces
which many architects consider typical of "liquid
stone".
Notwithstanding the above criticism the archi-
tects are to be congratulated on the beautiful effect
produced by this ceiling. The concrete arches and
beams spanning the annex to the Dining Room in
the Michigan Union would have gained consider-
ably by such painting.
The bungalow 307 Lindavista Street on the West
Side of Ann Arbor was built with precast 2" thick
panels and 4" wide grooved columns and plates
which were shipped from Chicago. After pouring
the cellar walls and ceiling slab, the panels which
are approximately 4' wide and one story high were
fitted into the grooved framework. Insulation was
procured by furring in the usual manner. The
precast units were manufactured with a carefully
chosen mix and a pleasing surface layer. This
bungalow was built three years ago and the walls
have survived the weather very well.
The residence 821 West Liberty Street (corner of
7th Street) has a porch which seems symbolical
of the evolution which American domestic archi-
tecture should undergo; a concrete balustrade has

the thin wooden columns which
emerge from the concrete piers give a
strong contrast to the latter's solid-
ity. The spaces between the small
piers are spanned by concrete arches
and the spandrels are effectively treat-
ed, having small stones of various
colors inserted in the concrete. Sunk-
panels of smooth finish, some of
which are diamond shaped, complete
the ornamentation.
Between 433 and 437 South D'nnsion
Street stands a flower-bowl on a curved
standard modelled of concrete apparently by build-
ing up layer after layer with a trowel, a technique
which has been amply described by R. C. Davison in
"Concrete Pottery and Garden Furniture" (1910).
The comparatively thin sections and the strongly
curved outlines (Fig. 1) surprise the observer who is
more accustomed to expect this accentuation of the
ferro-element of ferro-concrete in French examples.
According to the owner this delicate piece of con-
crete has been exposed to our severe climate for
seven years which goes to prove that properly made
concrete stands our climate better than the major-
ity of architects believe. (But then, u'ften wasn't
the majority wrong?)
The concrete lamp-posts newly installed on our
Campus represent an interesting type of concrete
forming: by rotating wet concrete in a cylindrical
mold a hollow mast was created, as centrifugal force
threw the concrete particles towards the circumfer-
ence where they covered the reinforcing which had
been inserted previously. The surface-layer is green
and the elegantly curved standards have a pleasing
appearance. Engineers seem to have more confi-
dence in concrete's ability to withstand Michigan
weather than many architects do!
The residences of Prof. A. B. Moehlman and Mr.
H. Silvester on the Barton Shore Drive, designed
by Ernest Flagg, have a novel type of wall. Form
work such as used for concrete was erected, and
large stones placed in them against the boards; or-
dinary concrete was then poured in, filling the in-
terstices and forming a monolithic core.
Two residences with rammed dirt walls were
built in Ann Arbor a few years ago, one of them
being erected by Prof. Menefec at 802 Rose Ave. (cor-
ner of White Street). The walls are 18" thick and
covered with "gunite", i.e., concrete applied with
the cement-gun. Cement was added to the sand
forming the jambs, and the lintels are of reinforced
concrete. Prof. Franklin's house on Long Shore Drive
was likewise built with "Pise" walls which vary in
thickness from 1-1^2 ft. The gunite is jkt" thick and
cracks have developed except in one area which has
metal-lath on tar-paper between the rammed dirt
and the cement stucco (gunite). The Pise method
which has been used in France and other European
countries proved disappointing in these local
cases, I believe: the expense of the form work is
the same as for concrete walls; the saving of trans-
portation-costs of materials (the dirt dug out in
excavating the cellar being used for the wralls) is
partly offset by failures in the course of erection:
rain washed down one of the freshly made walls of
Prof. Franklin's residence and also in some other
instances certain sections had to be rammed a sec-
ond time. The door and window openings are en-
closed with concrete. The insulation attained by
the thickness of the wall might be procured in a
concrete house by an air-space between the outer
and inner concrete shell.
East of Ann Arbor are two modest houses which
demonstrate that the workman's love for the build-
ing he is creating—the Gothic tradition which part-
ly disappeared when the Renaissance was victori-
ous—is an important factor. The home of Mr. Wal-
ter Gardener, a mason, lies in Platt on the south side
of the Packard Road. The rubble masonary with its
various colors, the low arches spanning the cellar-
windows, the chimney-walls curving upwards from
a wide base with an impressive s\veep, give this
dwelling a certain distinction. Yet it is more in
small details such as bird-baths and flower-bowls
that one can detect the mason's love for his mate-
rials and work; they consist of a kind of concrete
in which stones of delicate tints are inserted. A
mailbox executed in the form of a little Chatelet
of concrete with large pebbles, hangs next to the
door and constitutes a fine exhibit of workmanship
and patience.
Automobilists taking the Ecorse Road to Detroit will
notice on the outskirts of Ypsilanti, just after the sharp
curve in the road a house (No. 996) made of concrete
blocks having a peculiar texture; on closer inspec-
tion it is seen that in the face of each block three to
five stones chosen for fine colors and grain have
been inserted. The owner, Mr. Davis, a foundry-
worker has altered his concrete-block machine so

The Death of Edison
It is fitting that we pause for a moment to pay
homage to that man whose inventions play an
important part in our daily lives,—Thorns A. Edi-
son. His name to the people of the world is
synonymous with electric lights, electrical power.
To the Engineer the name ''Edison" means ''The
Master Mind of Applied Science". He might right-
ly be called the "Faraday of America" for he util-
ized in a practical way the discoveries of his fel-
low English scientist. It is significant to note that
this year is the semi-centennial of the production
by Edison of the large and efficient and thorough-
ly commercial generator. It was installed at the
Paris exposition in 1881 and caused much skepti-
cism among the foreign Engineers.
In reviewing the life of Edison there is one char-
acteristic that is outstanding. Born as he was of
poor parents, his education was quite meager. It
was of little consequence, however, for though his
attending school had ceased, he continued to study.
This study never stopped. It is interesting to note
as we go to class from day to day how every-
body is studying hard to graduate and they all
say "Gee but it will be fine when this studying is
all over". Study once started can never end for
education and training of the mind goes on all
during our lives. It is a one-way street and takes
us to a goal just beyond our reach but we must
stop and shop along the way at the various stalls
of learning so that as we progress in our journey
we will appreciate and enjoy the many new ex-
periences as we meet them along the way.
Apologies—Prof. Robertson
The staff of the Michigan Technic wishes to apolo-
gize at this time for the serious error which oc-
curred on page seven of our October issue. Mr.
B. L. Robertson was mis-titled as Dean of the Penn
State Engineering College whereas his official title
at the present time is Assistant Professor of Elec-
trical Engineering at the University of California.
At the time when we received the article from Mr.
Robertson he held the same position on the Penn
State Faculty and has since joined the staff of the
Engineering College of U. of C.
Although we mis-titled the Dean of Penn State
Engineering College and conferred upon one Mich-
igan man this title we apologize to Dean Sackett
and are proud to say that he also is a son of Mich-
igan, lie was in his student days a member of the
Technic staff and since leaving school has been
a continual subscriber to The Technic. Being a
former publisher himself we trust he will excuse
us for this mistake as he undoubtedly has first
hand experience in the way these mistakes occur.

It seems to be the vogue nowadays for visitors
to Europe, when interviewed by the press on their
return to the States, to comment on the financial
condition of Germany, or to suggest a cure-all for
the depression—the which panacea they have dis-
covered abroad. Professor J. C. Brier of the Chem-
ical Engineering department, who spent the sum-
mer months touring England, France and Switzer-
land, found the paradoxical situation of the motor
car in England of far more interest.
It seems that in the latter country automobiles
are taxed on their horsepower rating at a figure
almost equivalent to five dollars a horsepower.
This observation might seem very trite to an Eng-
lishman, but in this country where manufacturers
advertise huge engine ratings in bringing out new
models, it is startling to say the least. The an-
nual British tax on a high-powered American car
would comfortably purchase one of the lower-
priced models on the market. In fact, it was be-
cause of this tax that the Austin motor car was
developed in England before its production in
America was attempted. The urge is to reduce en-
gine horsepower, instead of increasing it, as is the
wont here.
Then again gasoline carries a seventeen cent tax
in place of the nominal three cents in Michigan.
Professor Brier's advice to those who contem-
plate a tour of England is to discreetly leave their
cars at home.
New Anemometer
Invisible, constantly shifting, varying from
zephyr to gale force in a few seconds, wind gusts
have been one of the few natural forces defying ac-
curate scientific record. Now a type of anemo-
meter, radically new in design and so sensitive that
it will detect a fall in wind pressure from 85 miles
per hour to zero occurring in the one hundred and
twentieth part of a second and which gives a com-
plete photographic record, has been announced in
bulletin 20 of the University of Michigan Depart-
ment of Engineering Research. Such accurate in-
formation in the form of continuous records of
wind behaviour will vastly supplement the knowl-
edge of engineers of electric power lines, large air-
craft, tall buildings and other structures heretofore
designed to resist the force of a theoretically steady
wind, a thing which probably never occurs in na-
ture. The work was carried on by Professor R.
H. Sherlock and Professor M. B. Stout of the Uni-
versity College of Engineering.
The new anemometer discards entirely the de-
sign with the three cups rotating on a spindle which
is commonly seen spinning on the roofs of govern-
ment buildings. The Michigan instrument is a
small metal box, the front of which is delicately
hinged so as to bend inward with every variation
in wind pressure on its face. A short plunger con-
nects with a magnetic transmitter within the box,
carrying the electric current passing through the
coils, which, in turn is used to vibrate the tiny
mirror of an oscilliograph. The beam of light from
this mirror is then registered on a photographic
film, and a continuous record of wind pressure is
obtained.
Because electricity and light are substituted for
the springs usually found in pressure gauges, the
element of inertia is largely eliminated, and almost
instantaneous responses are made possible.
In mapping the size of a wind gust the experi-
menters establish a series of anemometers mounted
at the same height on a straight line of poles, and
another series at varying levels on a high tower.
By comparing the records of these instruments it is
then possible to show the width, height and ve-
locity of any single gust of wind from its first im-
pact to its passing. So complete and complex are
the data available from such a set up, that if a com-
plete chart of a single storm were worked out in
detail it would take several workers from six to
eight months.
What Do You Think?
How do you like the new make-up in this issue?
Do you like the type of article? What do you like
about the magazine and what don't you like?
These are some of the questions that have been
puzzling the staff for some time. We have tried to
get opinions from the students and the alumni.
The students that we have asked do not seem to
know exactly what they want so we try to give
them what we think they will like. If you are a
student and liked this issue, the contents, the make-
up, etc., tell us about it. If you do not, write your
criticism out and send it to the office or tell some
staff member what is wrong. Do not forget that
this magazine is published for the students pri-
marily and by the students. It is distinctly your
magazine so take an interest in it. If you are an
alumni tell us the type of articles that you would
like to see published. Should they be technical
or diversified among the bordering sciences. There
are a great number of alumni subscribers who are
former staff members. If you are one why not sit
clown as you read this issue and drop us a little
note as to what you think the magazine should
be. We want to hear from all alumni so that they
will always be in contact with their old school.

OUR PROFESSORS
A New Department of Brief Interviews
with the Faculty
Professor
John Stephen
Worley
ONE of the frequently cited advantages of a
large University, such as Michigan, is its
ability to attract men to the faculty who are
nation-wide or world-wide in reputation, to the end
that they are available as the nearly ultimate
source of knowledge in their fields of work. We
are fortunate to have many such men on the fac-
ulty, and among this group must be counted John
S. Worley, Professor of Transportation Engineer-
ing.
Professor Worley was born in Jackson county,
Missouri, and attended Odessa College of that
state. His degrees of B.S., M.S. and C.E. (corre-
sponding to the present-day doctorate) were ob-
tained at the University of Kansas, however.
Following the year 1900 he became engaged in
the location and construction of steam, interur-
ban and street railways, the design and superin-
tendence of many important public works and the
appraisal of many public properties. So proficient
did he become in these fields that he was made
a member of the Engineering Board of the Inter-
state Commerce Commission for the period 1913-
20, which board, with the assistance of Judge C.
A. Prouty, worked out plans for and administered
the valuation of railways in the United States dur-
ing the first seven years of the work. This period
of service with the government was terminated by a
year's work as Consulting Valuation Engineer of
the I. C. C., and in 1922 he came to the University
of Michigan.
Incidental to these duties Professor Worley fa-
miliarized himself with the intricacies of the law
and in 1919 was admitted to the Missouri bar, al-
though he never practiced. He also lectured on
transportation at the University of Kansas during
the period 1916-17.
From 1920 to 1926 he was engaged in extensive
business operations, being director, vice-president
and general manager of several corporations which,
for this period, manufactured and sold some
$50,000,000 worth of products. This in itself gives
indication of the remarkedly diversified abilities of
the man.
Professor Wrorley's society membership includes
the American Society of Civil Engineers, the Amer-
ican Railway Engineering Society, Sigmo Xi, Tau
Beta Pi, and Sigma Chi, social fraternity.
An interview was secured with Professor Worley
in order that further information might be secured
for our thumb-nail biography, but with little suc-
cess. He very modestly talked football instead, and
proved to be possessed of unusual discernment in
the niceties of the game. We should have liked to
languish in a long chat with such a congenial con-
versationalist, but, realizing the value of time, we
induced Professor Worley to explain some of the
features of the Transportation Library before we
took our leave.
This library is under his direct charge, and is
more or less a "pet" of his. By judicious fore-
sight the library has grown to be one of the fore-
most of its kind in the world, and a very great
many calls are made on it from all over the country.
At present some hundred thousand items are to be
found in it, running from old lithographs and etch-
ings to present day photographs, from treatises on
railroading published in the 1820's and '30's to the
most recent equipment catalogues, models, old and
rare books and, in fact, about everything on the
various phases of transportation. If this has been
accomplished in the past ten years, we almost dread
to think what the future holds in store.

Who They Are and
What They Are Doing
IN looking over the annals of the history of
Michigan graduates, one is struck, if he regards
them observantly, with what seems to be a
general rule that Ann Arbor, the home of the alma
mater, is not the settling ground for those who
reach the peaks of success. The University town,
however, has not needed to work very hard to un-
cover at least one major exception in the person of
Gardner S. Williams whose career may even seem
so outstanding as to bombast any further utiliza-
tion of the "non success rule." His inspiring ca-
reer so overshadows the usual indictment of Ann
Arbor as a business town that we may, without ob-
jections from anyone who reads and appreciates
the following account of his rise to the heights,
offer his deeds as the exception which proves the
rule inapplicable. Let us then, in fancy, journey
back to the earliest stages in Mr. Williams' life and
review the most climatic points of a well spent ca-
reer with the view in mind of honoring the per-
petrator of such accomplishments and profiting as
much as possible from a tale of obstacles sur-
mounted.
The first slide to be projected upon the screen of
our minds is that of a ruddy faced frosh engineer,
dressed to fit the fashions of 1885, and treading the
greensward of an early University of Michigan
campus. His earnest face shows an amazing ca-
pacity for hard work and his marks add impetus to
that retrospection. He is supplementing his col-
lege work with experience in waterworks construc-
tion, an activity which he explains by unfolding to
view an enrollment card showing registration in
Hyrdaulic Engineering. Four years more pass,
Graduation Day is left behind in the haze of
memory, and our young engineer is seen starting
down the road of experience, equipped as well as
was possible at that time. His first connection is
with the Detroit Board of Water Commissioners
in the capacity of Civil Engineer. After five years
of service in this affiliation has marked him as
Gardner S.
Williams
'89E
standing out head and shoulders above the rest of
his group, Mr. Williams is invited to join the
faculty of Cornell University in order to organize
the hydraulic laboratories of that great engineer-
ing school and establish his specialized branch of
engineering on a substantial basis. After putting
everything in smooth working order and staying on
as head of his department in this eastern college
until 1904, Mr. Williams, reminiscent of his days of
pleasure on the campus in Ann Arbor, voluntarily
transferred to the University of Michigan and be-
gan seven years of teaching in his alma mater.
And now, in 1911, we picture a new office open-
ing up in Ann Arbor, new gold letters on the plate
glass proclaiming that Gardner S. Williams is of-
fering his services to the public as a practicing
Consulting Engineer. That public which knows
and respects his abilities is still seeing that suc-
cess shall attend his endeavors. The International
Waterways Commission, picked in 1903 to straight-
en up the American foreign commerce situa-
tion, and which worked until 1905 completing its
task, was materially aided by this outstanding
engineer who labored as a member of the Commis-
sion throughout the entire period of its existence.
He is also a member of a great number of active
and honorary engineering societies and has even
dabbled quite extensively into technical writing.
In this latter connection, Mr. Williams is co-au-
thor of "Hydraulic Tables", published in 1905 and
containing a useful compilation of data and results
for all types of hydraulic experiment and computa-
tion. Besides this he was called upon to write the
entire section on hydraulics in the "American Civil
Engineer's Handbook". During the war he served
as a Major in the Engineering Corps.

COLLEGE
EDWIN F.
RUSSELL
'32E
THIS month we were thinking of conveying
our Spotlight down to Ferry Field, to the
end that we might catch Ed Russell in the
act of burning up the cinders. Unfortunately,
someone on the Technic business staff timidly sug-
gested that Flo Ziegfield might drop his advertising
if we exploited handsome legs in competition with
the well-known Follies, so we perforce deemed it
best to present Ed in a more conventional pose.
The beauteous Russell (you don't dare hit us, you
big bully!) entered the University in the fall of
1928 to start on his quest of the degree of B.S.
in Ch.E. He had been thinking of going to school
in the East, but his final decision was happily co-
incident with his father's desires, as the latter grad-
uated from here—having even taken work under
Professor A. H. White.
Being interested in athletics to the extent of hav-
ing acted as sports editor for his high school paper,
Ed reported for work on the freshman track squad.
He engaged himself in hurdling at first, but left off
skimming the timbers for the sprints and the quar-
ter mile. This last event he won at last year's Big
Ten meet, and he contributed much to the mile re-
lay team. His election to the captaincy of the track
team for this year indicates the value of his serv-
ices to the squad.
Ed, however, did not entirely lose himself in this
one field of endeavor. During his sophomore year
he was elected to the Honor Committee, and was
appointed a member of the Prom Committee. The
next year he topped things off by getting himself
elected to the class presidency, so it surprised no
one when Triangles bid him to membership. Mich-
igamua also claimed him towards the last of the
year, and, if suggestions to that august order are
permissible, it would be distinctly fetching to have
Ed known among the tepees of the braves as "Me-
run-like-h—" or "Dogs-bark-plenty-much".
To round out his exhibition of talent, Ed has
been a consistently good .scholar. There can be
little question but that the fellows at the Phi Sigma
Kappa house did right by themselves when they
invited him to become a brother.
Ed is a nice fellow, but there's one thing that
we do hold against him,—he's too good-looking.
The Parting of the Ways
Readers of this magazine who did not keep in
touch with Ann Arbor news this summer will
doubtless be interested in learning of the divorce
of the Colleges of Engineering and Architecture
from a joint administration. There had been a long
felt need for action of this nature, for the engineer-
ing and architectural students are not as closely
allied as they seem. On the other hand there is a
very real reason why the architect should have
much in common with the landscape gardener,
those interested in Fine Arts and even play pro-
duction people. We might say that under the new
arrangement it is proposed to effectuate a merging
of aesthetic interests, rather than the professional.
The details of the functioning of the new de-
partment have as yet to be completely worked out.
It is understood, however, that a representative
from each of the departments that are fusing into
the new group will form an executive council with
one of the members acting as chairman. It is to be
understood that a new college is not being fromed,
as the University could ill afford the expense for
the time being, but merely a new department which
is expected to be the source of a more efficient bud-
get and more satisfactory operation.
Steel Forging Failures Avoided
Burning, a serious and more common fault than
is usually realized, and scaling, hitherto regarded
as almost inevitable in steel forging, may be
avoided by careful heating of the metal, with a
consequent large saving by avoiding discards on
inspection as well as a reduction of the danger of
steel parts failing while in operation and endanger-
ing life or causing costly shut downs in plant oper-
ation, according to results of research done by Dr.
D. W. Murphy and Wr. E. Jominy at the Univer-
sity of Michigan and given in a bulletin of the De-
partment of Engineering Research.

Here's the News—
Hello Alumnus:
Dropping into the office this morning with a
good day's work ahead, our first thought is to open
up the little file in the corner and see what the
news is. Judging from the swelling pile of letters
which flows out we would say that your old school
friends have been rather generous in supplying bits
of news for your perusal. In fact they all seem to
enjoy writing in and saying hello as much as you
probably enjoy receiving their various messages.
And here is what they have to say, beginning
with the old timers, the boys who graduated way
back when—
1889
The first is a spicy bit of gossip from Richard
Kuehn, Jr., Chief Engineer with the American
Bridge Company's Pennsylvania division. He
wants to know why he hasn't been hearing from
more of his old pals at Michigan. His present ad-
dress is the Frick Building in Pittsburgh, Pennsyl-
vania.
1906
The class of 1906 is surely well represented this
time. The first letter to come to the surface is one
from Willis F. Durlin, a member of the sales staff
of the Erie Forge and Steel Co., in Erie, Pennsyl-
vania. He has a fourteen year old daughter and
lives at 911 West Tenth Street.
And here's a short and
snappy greeting from Wal-
ter T. Fishleigh, Consulting
Engineer for the Ford Mo-
tor Company of Detroit,
Michigan. He attended the
summer meeting of the So-
ciety of Automotive Engi-
neers at W h i t e Sulphur
Springs, West Virginia, and
enjoyed himself thoroughly.
Frank R. Fowles writes
from Detroit to let all his
former schoolmates in on
the secret that he is now in
the service of the Hudson
Motor Car Company of that
city as General Service Manager.
Then there is John Wood Campbell, who is in the
operation and engineering department of the Ameri-
can Telephone and Telegraph in New York City.
Give him a "ring" classmates—ask the operator for
the number.
After wandering to various corners of the earth,
W. Arthur Gifford started his own company, the
(jirTord Engineering Company, of which he is now
President and Manager. You'll find his place in
Lansing, Michigan.
Adrian John Neerken has been giving his services
to the Hupp Motor Car Company in Detroit since
1914. He is a Body Engineer.
And from way out in Utah, Charles John Ullrich
has been working at engineering law practice. He
is married and his family of four lives at 1528 Har-
vard Avenue in Salt Lake City.
1907
The first '07 to come to our attention is James
Irving Sutherland. He is the Chief Estimator of
the Standard Steel Car Corporation. Address your
letters to 559 Third Street in Butler, Pennsylvania.
Ralph S. Heath was recently put in charge of the
Illinois Waterway Department of the U. S. Engi-
neers. He lives in LaGrange. Illinois, at 435 South
Madison Street.
Edward Ottoman, Jr., tells
us that his son Louis is en-
tering the University in the
class of '35E, after prepara-
tion at Northwestern Mili-
tary and Naval Academy.
4446 X. Central Park Ave-
nue, Chicago is Mr. Otto-
man's address.
1909
You 1909 alumni should
give us more news. Starr
Truscott of 147 Victoria
Avenue, Hampton, Virginia
is a supporter of his class.
He is with the National Ad-
visory Committee for Aero-
nautics as an engineer.
Another '09 writes in to

1914
allurgical Company, 30 E. 42nd Street, New York
City. He is Francis P. Gormely, the Vice President
and General Manager.
1910
This one is postmarked Detroit, Michigan, and
seems to have just recently dropped in on us. It's
a welcome little note from Edward J. Posselius,
who is now President and part owner of the Good-
housekeeping Shop in the Motor City. He says
he has been wondering why more of you don't
drop him a line at his new address, 1102 Seyburn
Avenue.
1911
The 1911 group have Glenn H. Norquist as their
representative in these pages this time. He is liv-
ing out in Jamestown, N.Y., at present, where he
is President of the Jamestown Screen and Manufac-
turing Company.
1912
And here's an interesting piece of news from one
of the more popular of the members of '12. Walter
C. Wheeler sends on the news that he has severed
his connections with the Union Carbide and Carbon
Company of New York and is now in the patent
department of the A. O. Smith Company of Mil-
waukee, Wisconsin. He is living, however, in
Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, at 227 Thornapple Park-
way.
Along with Mr. Wheeler's greeting, we have this
short and snappy hello from Harold L. Moore, who
is also with the A. O. Smith Co. His residence is
located at 46 Melrose Ave., Wauwatosa.
After reading what Fred G. Fleming has to say
this time, we have this little bit of information to
pass along to his old friends. He has held various
engineering positions with the Pennsylvania State
Highway Department and the Pennsylvania Rail-
road for the past several years. He is now Assist-
ant Trainmaster with the Reading Company in
Harrisburg. He says also that he is married, has
a daughter, and lives at 1839 North Second Street.
1913
Frank C. Gibbs writes in a cheery few words
from Oak Park, Illinois, in order to let you all
know his new address. He has recently moved
over to 150 North Cuyler Avenue.
Frank D. Haskins doesn't have much to tell us
this time but we all welcome hearing from him
anyway. He says that he has joined the staff of
the General Motors Institute of Technology at
Flint, Michigan and enjoys his work very much.
Another laconic but very welcome note says that
Fred Peck is now managing the Battle House Hotel
Co., Mobile, Alabama. His official position is that
of General Director.
Next we come upon this little communication
from the Foundry Equipment Company at Cleve-
land, Ohio, which designs and builds foundry
ovens. There are several Michigan engineers on
the list of officers for this concern. Charles A. Bar-
nett is President and Carl Mayer is Vice-President.
Word has been received regarding an unfortu-
nate accident which happened on August 10, near
Saginaw, Mich. Stuart G. Baits, Chief Engineer
and Designer for the Hudson Motor Car Company
and a member of the Board of Directors, was se-
verely injured in the crash but is achieving a rapid
recovery. He was removed to his home in Grosse
Pointe Park early in September.
This one travelled all the way from California to
bring a greeting from Willard G. Gillson who is
now Pacific Coast Sales Manager for the Bates
Valve Bag Corporation. His office in San Fran-
cisco is in the Russ Building, number 768.
Just a word from Robert Dillman who is now
affiliated with the Libby, McNeil, and Libby Corp.,
Blue Island, Ililnois, as Assistant General Super-
intendent.
We see now a few lines from the Chief Engineer
for Warner Brothers Eastern Vitaphone Studios,
Porter H. Evans. 'His offices are in Brooklyn, N.Y.,
and his address is 43 Eighty-sixth Street.
1915
Here's one of our old alumni who is now in the
National Service. This communication concerns
Valentine F. Spring who is now an Assistant Engi-
neer in the United States Engineering Offices at
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He writes from 2734
Darien Street.
This little bit has to do with Wyeth Allen, Pres-
ident of the University of Michigan Club of Mil-
waukee, who was recently elected President of the
Milwaukee chapter of the Society of Industrial
Engineers.
1916
We hear from way down in Texas in this little
note from Carl S. Blomshield who is now District
Manager of the Texas Electric Service Company
and is located at Big Springs, Texas.
1917
According to the latest news Don A. Smith has
left the General Motors Export Company of New
York in order to join the Charles H. Hills Co., Chi-
cago, Illinois. His business address is 1414 Mo-
nadnock Building, 53 West Jackson Blvd.
1918
Another Chicago address dropped in the mail the
other day when we heard from William H. Jensen,
who is now Assistant Chief Engineer of the Calu-
met Station of the Commonwealth Edison Com-
pany. The exact location is 7601 Eberhardt, Grand
X Station.

HOW PACKARD PROVES A PACKARD
By F. E. Magel, '35E
THE average automobile consumer of today
can feel very fortunate in knowing that there
are a few motor car manufacturers who find
it worthwhile sacrificing a great amount of money
and effort in automotive research and testing.
Some automobile companies have confined auto-
mobile experimental work to their respective engi-
neering laboratories, while the more progressive
manufacturers have advanced one step farther in
research. They have brought about the construction
of large proving grounds in order that the automo-
bile might be tested in a more practical manner
for every possible phase in car performance.
The million dollar Packard Proving Ground
which is located four miles north of Utica, Mich-
igan represents a fine example of the modern auto-
mobile proving ground. The total area of the
proving ground covers five hundred and four (504)
acres of land which includes a two and one-half
mile oval shaped concrete speedway, a group of
buildings used for automotive repair shops and lab-
oratories, and outside of the track lies a wide varia-
tion in types of sand, dirt, and gravel roads. In
order to make the roads more realistic and typical
of bad mountain roads, steep artificial hills and a
combination of dips, and extremely sharp curves
have been added in the road construction. This
tailor-made topography affords a splendid place to
make the most severe test for road durability,
handling qualities, or comfort in driving over rough
roads.
Perhaps the most interesting feature of the con-
crete speedway or track is the fact that it is so ac-
curately designed and constructed that a car may
be driven around the track at a considerable rate
of speed without the driver even laying a finger
on the wheel. The super-elevated curves, parabol-
ical in shape at both ends of the track are largely
responsible for this peculiar feature and conse-
quently they are so designed that the forces are
practically evenly divided on all four wheels when
the car makes the turn. The slope of elevation on
the straight-away is divided into three sections: a
section of ten feet at a 1 degree slope of eleva-
tion, a second section of twenty (20) feet at an
elevation of ten (10) degrees, and a third paraboli-
cal section 25 feet in width having a maximum (30)
degree slope. In constructing the track, one of the
most important problems the construction engi-
neers had to meet was the question of reducing the
concrete expansion to the smallest degree possible.
It was found that by using a carefully selected
gravel for concrete mix and by reducing the size
of each paved section the expansion would be very
small and special provisions were made to control
it.
The work at the Proving Grounds consists of a
complete check on car performance which includes
testing for: Maximum and Minimum speeds, Fuel
Economy at variable speeds. Vibration, Braking
power, Acceleration, Deceleration, Road Durability,
Steering Effort and Control, and the Endurance
and wearing qualities of parts. Wind velocity,
temperature, and barometric conditions are checked
and recorded during all tests. The types of cars
tested are usually stock cars, but frequently an ex-
perimental car for a proposed future model which
has been previously tested by other means is put

twenty-four (24) hours a day over rough roads,
climbing steep grades and grinding through heavy
sandy roads. After a marathon of this type, the
experimental car may then be taken apart at the
adjoining laboratory and each part is separately
checked for defects or wear. Possibly, it would be
found that the pinion gear in the rear axle housing
had worn too much or possibly a leaf in the left
front spring was broken by excessive strain. A
new spring lead might be replaced and the same
ordeal repeated, and if the same thing occurred
again it would be up to the Engineering staff to
adopt a new spring stabilizer.
An interesting check for motor acceleration un-
der loads or on hill climbing can be made on a
level track by the use of the Dynomometer Car,
which is an ordinary car which is equipped with
an air compressor instead of a motor.
A cylinder shaped cable which connects the
Dynomometer car to the tow or test car registers
the pressure of the resisting air compressor against
power of the test car. The air pressure is con-
trolled by controlling gauges on the dash board of
the test car, while the cars are in motion. By
proper regulation of the control instruments the
resistance of the Dynomometer car will corre-
spond to the pull of most any steep grade or hill.
The testing of brakes is not mere guess work
but it involves the use of a stop watch and the
exact gauging of the distance between the stopping
point and the point where the brakes were first
applied. The length of the skid marks on dry
pavement helps to determine the accuracy of brake
band tension and adjustment. Braking power and
car skidding is often checked on the downward
grade of hilly gravel roads and on wet pavements.
The accurate testing of various car models at
Maximum and Minimum speeds is important be-

termined at variable speeds for each style of body
and chasis. The ability for a car to pick up speed
from an idling rate of speed is compared with
rapid acceleration by gear shifting, or acceleration
from a stand-still without the use of the first or sec-
ond gears. The record for the greatest maximum
speed on outdoor circular tracks is 148.17 miles per
hours and it was made by Leon Duray on the Pack-
ard Track.

maintaining and improving quality in the better
automobile of today.
When Science Comes Of Age
(Continued from page 6)
ly scratched the surface. Indeed most students of
literature suppose there is nothing here that sci-
ence can do. To illustrate we may simplify a very
complicated problem by isolating from the com-
plex of time, pitch, energy, tempo, and tone-color
the element of time and note the mathematical
ratios in two selections upon the qualities of which
we can readily agree. Holmes is relatively regular,
inflexible, rigid, static; Whitman is fluid, flexi-
ble, moving, dynamic. We sense that much easily
enough and agree upon it so long as we ask no
searching questions about the reason for the agree-
ment. What does mathematics show?
HHas there any old fellow got mixed with
the boys?
If there has, put him out without making a
noise."
In time, the lines are exactly equal, a ratio of
4 to 4; the half lines are equal, a ratio of 2 to 2;
the feet are equal, a ratio of 1 to 1. The whole is
the analysis further to apply to line pairs or in the
other direction to the syllables of the metrical foot,
the same simple relations hold.
"When lilacs last in the dooryard bloomed,
And the great star early sloped in the west-
ern sky in the night
I mourned and yet shall mourn with every-re-
turning spring."
Lines two and three are equal. These two lines
are each one-half longer than line one, giving a
ratio of 2: 3. The half-lines are in all cases exact,
giving within the line a ratio of 2 : 2 but as be-
tween half lines in the first and half lines in the
second and third a ratio of 2 :3. The first line has
in each half two metrical feet with a ratio of 2 :3.
The second and third lines are alike in having three
feet in each half-line with time value in the series
of 2, 3, 4. Again if we carry it further to the
syllables in each metrical foot we shall find the
same flexibility.
That is only a rough-and-ready measurement
of the least subtle of the five factors of the complex
whole. There is good reason to suppose that a
more refined technique would show the ratios are
less simple than is indicated in the series 2, 3, 4.
But that rough approximation is enough to show
why Whitman's lines seem more volatile, more
dynamic than the equally good lines of Holmes;
they belong to a different order.
With science underlying our whole physical,
social and economic system it is natural enough
that each branch of it should be absorbed in the
mastery of its own small realm. With some meas-
ure of control in that secured, the interrelation and
integration of the several sciences was bound to
come. The application of this knowledge to an in-
telligent appreciation of the arts is not so obvious
a step nor so immediate but nevertheless equally
inevitable. A mathematician without interest in
the relation of number to spiritual things is still
only a manipulator of figures, however clever he
may be at the trick. An engineer interested only
in the stability of his bridge is just a skilled tech-
nician whose science is yet in the first stage of its
evolution. An artist without interest in the laws
governing his art is a babe in the woods. The only
hope as yet discernible on the horizon is in the
help of the sciences when they finally grow up.
Mechanics Liens
(Continued from page 7)
of the lumber actually passed into the building. At
least a lien should be good for the amount of the
depreciation. A similar case arises where coal is
consumed in the running of hoists, or where cables
and tools are entirely used up in the erection of a
building. Of course, if an engine is essentially as
good after the construction as it was when it was
brought to the work, no lien should be granted.
Quite a different situation arises where material
is purchased for a building but is never used, or
even delivered to the building site. If this ma-
terial is specially made for the building, not use-
able elsewhere, the lien is said to be good. How-
ever, if the material is of a general stock in trade,
the lien is not good. Even in this last case, the lien
may be good if the non-use is due to the fault of
the owner. These cases must be studied carefully
since in cases of unused material there is always the
danger of fraud. At first blush there appears little
consistency in allowing a lien for unused plaster,
specially molded for a building, and refusing a lien
for unused plans and specifications on a vacant lot,
but the age-old maxim, so familiar to the legal
practitioner, "Circumstances Alter Cases", plays an
important role in the history of these decisions.
T"he mechanics lien is a claim against the prop-
erty itself, and may take either one of two forms.
It may be a formal lien recording the claim against
Page Twenty-Two

to four months after completion of service, (the
time limit varying according to the statutes of the
several states) which operates to cut off other
creditors, such as mortgagees, etc; or it may be
merely a claim against the owner himself, and
must be filed within about two years. The law is
very definite as to the period of recording, and just-
ly so. It offers the mechanic or the materialman
ample time to present his claim, and more im-
portant, it limits the period of uncertainty within
which the owner may face the possibility of a
lien; also a future purchaser of land or a mortgagee
may know positively that after a certain date no
liens can be presented for old claims on material
against the contractor.
The usual statute requires the contractor to sub-
mit a sworn affidavit, stating that all moneys on the
account in question have been paid, or listing every
case of outstanding debts. Having received this
affidavit, the owner must pay, holding out for any
liens recorded, or accounts payable. If an owner
does not retain sufficient amounts to meet the out-
standing bills of the contractor, he places himself
in the jeopardy of double payment, once to the con-
tractor, and once to the unpaid materialman, if the
latter submits a lien within the prescribed time
limit. However, if the contractor leaves one of his
creditors off of his affidavit, the owner may rely
on the affidavit and pay the contractor without fear
of a subsequent lien for the contractor's unpaid
bill.
The rules in Michigan, as determined by the
statutes and decisions, may be indicated in a gen-
eral way by the following cases.
In Merrill vs. Brant, 141 N. W. 550, it has been
held specifically that there must be a contract to
support a lien. The Michigan law is consistent
with the law in most states restricting the applica-
tion of the lien to a specific tract of land for a
definite improvement thereon. In Hammond vs.
Wells, 7 N. W. 218, it was held that the written
agreement must clearly identify the land. The case
of Van Cleve Glass Co., vs. Errott, 68 N. W. 978,
requires that the goods must be supplied with the
full knowledge that they are being furnished for the
improvement in question. The issue raised in 37
Michigan 313, was whether there was something
actually done to improve the property. In this con-
nection, if an owner has several projects under con-
struction at one time, it would seem that the spe-
cific material going to each tract of land should be
kept separate so that the material lien against any
tract should not include material used elsewhere.
The burden of this proof was placed on the lien
holder in Smalley vs. Gearing. 80 N. W. 797.
The Michigan statute provides in Section 13101
that a materialman or mechanic shall notify the
owner within fifteen days after commencement of
Dynamite clears the way for modern
engineering wonders!

IN 1802, E. I. du Pont de
Nemours, a young French
chemist in America, built and
began Co operate a small powder
mill on the banks of the Brandy-
wine River.
Today—after 129 years—the
trade-mark of the du Pont Com-
pany is well known throughout
the industrial world. Du Pont
Explosives have played a major
part in building the nation's rail-
roads, highways, aqueducts, reser*
voirs and subways; In clearing
millions of acres of land, in min-
ing enormous quantities of coal
and other minerals, and in making
possible many great engineering
enterprises.
Du Pont has never been content
merely to manu/a&lt;3ureexplosivcs.
Its highly trained technicians have
spent years in chemical research
. . . matching ingredient againsl
ingredient ... to develop new
improvements or to make new
explosives that will do a given
job better. It is significant that
a vail majority of all valuable
NEW explosives come from the
du Pont plants.
The information that du Pont
has gathered in more than a cen-
tury and a quarter is available to
you. As an engineer of today—
and tomorrow—you can't afford
not to know all there is to know
about DYNAMITE.

dition precedent to a lien, but is merely for the pro-
tection of the materialman or mechanic, as was at
issue in 72 N. W. 29.
The actual presentation of the claim for a lien
must state the services performed, with dates, and
clearly identify the improved land which is to be
charged. Michigan requires the claim to be filed
within sixty days after the completion of the work.
The "time of completion" sometimes offers a per-
plexing issue, particularly if the work was stopped
for a period and then resumed. In Washtenaw
Lumber Co., vs. Belding, 208 N. W. 152, it was held
that the subsequent use of material, if used in due
course, of construction, offers a proper date to fig-
ure the time limit for computing the sixty day
period. However, this case would not let a dead
lien be awakened by a trumped-up use of material
for the specific purpose of reviving the time limit of
the lien.
It is contrary to public policy to permit a lien to
be exercised against public structures. Section
13132 provides for a material bond, payable to the
State of Michigan whereby the contractor guaran-
tees payment of his bills on this account. In the
case of non-payment by the contractor, mechanics
and materialmen may take action against this bond
in lieu of a mechanics lien against one of the public
buildings.
The foreclosure of a mechanics lien is quite sim-
ilar to the foreclosure on real property. After due
hearing the court grants a decree of foreclosure and
authorizes a Court Commissioner or Receiver to sell
the same. From the proceeds of the sale the lien
holder is paid and the surplus goes to the owner.
Specific provision is made for the discharge of the
lien after the payment of the claim, with a statu-
tory penalty for failure to comply. Michigan al-
lows a fifteen months period of redemption within
which the former owner may re-purchase the prop-
erty upon payment of the amount of the lien and
costs of the foreclosure.
Electricity In Transit
(Continued from page 9)
connecting the oil circuit breakers and for other
needs, peculiar to each situation. Oil circuit
breakers, for disconnecting the substation under
load, or for tripping out under overload, also come
under this category of switches. Then there are
the protective devices which are necessary, the
fuses and lightning arresters. The metering and
control apparatus is also of importance and in-
cludes potential and current transformers, besides
myriads of meters. Finally, there are the power
transformers for stepping the voltage down, some
of the high capacity ones being almost large enough
for one to set up housekeeping in them.
The science of designing and building transform-
er substations is one of the most rapidly changing
spectacles of the engineering world today. A re-
cent trend, that has apparently caught hold to stay,
has been toward metal clad switch gear and this
will probably replace the substation as we now
know it. In this type of equipment the oil circuit
breakers, disconnect switches, metering equipment
and other apparatus are built up in units complete-
ly assembled at the factory and fully enclosed in
steel housings.
When this unit arrives in the field there is little
left to do but to put it in place and connect it to
the line. This results in a great saving of labor
and space, besides obviating any possibility of in-
correctly setting up or adjusting the apparatus.
Fire hazard is also reduced to a minimum.
The neat appearing substation of today, with its
good looking structure, varied equipment and well
designed control house is not an eyesore even in a
select neighborhood. Often when a substation is
built in a select residential district the control
house, built in front of the substation is a decided
addition to the good appearance of the neighbor-
hood. The utilities in the far west especially are
using this idea. Then the grounds and lawns about
a substation which is at all near a community or a
traveled road are kept up to the highest degree.
The step-up transformer substation, which is
usually built alongside the central po%ver plant is a
very close relation of the step-down station. The
switching station, which uses no transformers, is
also much like the transformer substation, but is
used only for switching and sectionalizing. The
automatic substation is another branch of the sub-
staion lineage, in which additional feeders are
brought in entirely automatically when the load
reaches a certain point.
From this brief article one can gather that the
transmission and distribution of electricity is a
major business in itself and one that is growing at
great strides. Wonderful progress has been made
in the past two decades and the immediate future
promises even greater triumphs to come. The elec-
trical giant is daily reaching into more homes, mil-
lions of which are still without electricity and when
the final reckoning is given, the transmission and
distribution engineers must be allotted their share
of the honors for the work they have so splendidly
clone.

only as a frieze or around the doors and windows
they would have been set off by the plain grey
wall-surface of ordinary blocks and the total effect
would have been nicer.
In contrast to this house a row of concrete block
residences erected recently in Cranbrook lack color and
seem to embody the viewpoint of the noted Vien-
nese architect A. Loos: "Ornament is a crime."
Some decorated blocks used as a sill-course, or an
ornamental porch-balustrade might have given
these homes more individuality. As in so many
other fields of human endeavor the Golden Mean
is the ideal we should strive after: Not the over-
loading with ornament as exemplified by the Ecorse
Road house—the expression of a workman's love
for beautiful stones; neither the extreme severity
of the Cranbrook houses referred to.
In building the garage at 1331 Geddcs Arc., Ann
Arbor, I desired to test a number of techniques
which I had investigated in preparing my book,
"The Ferro-Concre,te Style". Foundations were
only poured for the piers which were built of con-
crete blocks laid end to end. Two thin reinforcing
rods were inserted in the hollow center of each
pier which was then filled up with concrete. One
inch thick 2'x4' concrete slabs, reinforced with
chickencoop mesh had been precast by Mr. Ran-
dolph in his concrete-block shop. Two slabs at a
time were slid between the piers, fitting into the
grooves of the concrete blocks forming them; they
were pressed apart with small wooden wedges, thus
forming an insulating airspace. The outer surface
of the outer slab had received a relief-pattern by its
being cast into a die consisting of a piece of metal
ceiling, a method instigated by Frank Lloyd
Wright's "tapestry block slabs". In place of win-
dows, thick concrete slabs which had been pre-
cast in a sand-mold with inserted bottles were set
between the piers in two of the walls. Bottles were
used, as European hollow glass blocks ("Briques
Falconier") were not available. Bottles seemed
the best substitute, as they consist of thick glass
and have the hollow center which makes them in-
sulating, providing the mouth is closed. The slab
visible on the court-side reminds somewhat of a
Saracenic grille as the curved bottles, placed mouth
against mouth, create a baluster-like outline. This
treatment agrees with Frank Lloyd Wright's re-
commendation of glass in its various forms as one of
the cheapest and most effective decorative mate-
rials at the disposal of the modern architect.
Concrete chimney blocks 16"xl6", with a hol-
low circle inside a square frame, form the vous-
soirs over the door and serve to create a pierced
frieze which terminates the walls. These blocks
were made in half the usual thickness and into
their voids green, brown, blue, and white bottles

crete was then poured in the remaining spaces be-
tween the bottles and the original block. At the
top of the wall, the glass discs in the above colors
form flower-like patterns recalling the medieval
use of bottle glass for windows. The dark bands of
concrete which enframe each spot of colored light
at night make them much more effective in the
opinion of Professor Wilby.
Such a humble chimney-block serves as frame for
the first pictorial silhouette tracery ever attempted.
(Fig. 2). A square piece of window-glass was
bonded to the edges of the block with cement-
grout; in the inner circular hole a drawing of Henry
Ford's silhouette drawn from his profile-photograph
was placed underneath the glass; the area repre-
senting the head was filled with plasteline, thus
forming a raised silhouette with carefully cut-out
contours; the remaining space between the plaste-
line and the original concrete-block circle was filled
with concrete. After it had set, the plasteline was
scrapped off the glass, and the concrete silhouette-
tracery-block inserted as keystone in the flat arch
over the garage door. The making of this small
piece of concrete tracery proved simpler than ex-
pected.
Likewise the pouring of the curved roof ful-
filled all expectations placed on self-centering metal
lath used as reinforcing. This 2y2' wide metal-lath
was shipped from the factory in Ohio with the ex-
act curvature which the .segmental roof was to
have, and with such a length that it could span the
garage. The first strip was laid over the rein-
forced concrete beams which run over the piers, be-
fore the forms of these had been completely filled;
standing on a board which spanned these beams,
the workman poured concrete of such a consistency
that it could filter through the meshes of the ex-
panded metal but not flow through. The concrete
was smoothed with a trowel and then the next
metal-lath strip placed across the beams. After
placing all the strips, cement-stucco was plastered
over the rough undersurface and thus an approxi-
mately \l/2r' thick reinforced monolithic vault
formed; two coats of Medusa cement paint were ap-
plied as sole waterproofing of this roof-vault. The
advantage of the curved self-centering expanded
metal is apparent when one realizes the expense
which a curved wooden form for this would have
involved. The small pressed-in ribs with which this
metal-lath is manufactured give it sufficient stiff-
ness to retain its form in spite of the weight of the
fresh concrete. Thus this all-concrete garage was
made without any wooden form except those for
the beams; the time spent on the carpenter-work
for the cantilevered ends of these beams strength-
ened my aversion against wood-centering.
The father of Mr. F. L. Arnet '31A had kindly
given marble and slate fragments with which an
ornamental architrave around the garage-door was
made. The fragments were placed face down in a
shallow wooden frame and concrete poured in the
interstices; wire mesh was laid over this panel and
then additional concrete poured. After setting
these slabs which were about ll/2r' thick were wired
to the door-frame, thus forming one side of the
centering needed for the jamb and lintel. These
slabs are an example of "permanent centering".
Previously the rear wall of the house adjoin-
ing the garage had been covered with wire mesh
and concrete shot on with the cement-gun; pieces
of marble were pressed into the still wet concrete,
and a frieze created by inserting small pieces of
stained glass in the same manner. Under the win-
dow a precast panel was built in; stained glass
fragments were placed against one large piece of
ordinary glass and covered with concrete which
was reinforced by a thin wire mesh. So far no
cracks have developed in this gunite-stucco which
has withstood the best of four winters.
Around The College
(Continued from page 16)
temperature reaches a certain point and this burn-
ing temperature has been found to be lowered when
free oxygen is present in the furnace atmosphere.
The danger involved in burned forgings is that the
damage is often invisible to the naked eye, but may
be very serious in the center of the piece, and is
only detected in broken parts by the microscope
which shows the minute crystals of the metal to be
separated by large spaces, with increased likelihood
of breakage. More accurate temperature control
than is usually practiced and firing furnaces with
a slight over-supply of fuel to insure combustion
of all free oxygen will diminish the burning danger
by raising the burning point, Murphy found. Poor
quality of finished products and the economic loss
from scaling of heated steel surfaces is much
greater than is commonly recognized. Its forma-
tion involves loss in metal weight, and if removed
it involves extra labor costs, while if left and
pounded into the metal it causes weak spots, as
well as producing wrong sized parts through fill-
ing up or injury to dies. Scaling losses increase
as the heating temperature rises and become very
great at the melting points of the scales. Pres-
ence of sulfur in fuels used is also a more influ-
ential factor than is usually supposed in scale for-
mation. Total avoidance of scale can be made by
firing with a considerable excess of sulfur free
gas to use up all free oxygen, Murphy found, since
scale is chiefly iron oxide. In general commercial
practice with present furnaces this would be un-
economical, and points to the need of new furnace
designs, he says.

to Solve Future Traffic Problems
Because modern methods of transportation,
chiefly by automobile, tremendously widen the
area available to every man in which to conduct his
business or pleasure, the future will find necessary
a new system of super-highways, probably discard-
ing almost entirely old routes, and substituting
roads suitable for average speeds of 80 to 100 miles
an hour, laid out on a "regional" basis through
close co-operation between cities, counties and ad-
joining states, declares John S. Worley, Professor
of transportation engineering and curator of the
University of Michigan Transportation Library.
The automobile is the key to the future of
rapid transportation of the individual, since it of-
fers almost everything the American desires,—
personal possession, speed, safety, reliability.
"portability," and ease of operation by nearly all
adults. Mechanical excellence is still increasing,
and as better roads are available the speed will fur-
ther develop. The airplane, despite great progress,
seems to have inherent drawbacks of cost, opera-
tion, landing space and vulnerability to weather,
which preclude it as the great popular conveyance.
To take full advantage of the present and future
possibilities of the automobile we will have to turn
out united attention to the fundamental thing that
most limits its operation, the road on which it runs.
The average highway, we find, is a single strip of
paving some twenty feet wide, following most of
the curves and twists of the old wagon trails,
touching almost every village, going straight
through congested cities, up and down numerous
grades, and crossed about every half mile by a side
road, private drive or railway. On such roads, good
by present standards, an average speed of only 40
or 50 miles is possible between cities such as De-
troit and Chicago.
Contrast this with the ideal and logical main
artery between these cities. This highway, of two
separated lanes 24 feet wide for one way traffic,
would not pass through any town or city unless
absolutely necessary, and then by an elevated road-
way. The right of way would be fenced the whole
distance. Alignment and rate of grade would make
a clear view of 2,000 feet ahead always possible.
Every railway, cross road and street intersecting
it would be separated. The surface would be so
smooth as to have no noticeable variation when
driving at 100 miles an hour. On this highway the
future improved car could and would travel safely,
largely through grade crossings and removal of
the two way traffic menace, at average speeds of
from 80 to 100 miles an hour, making the Detroit
Chicago trip in a total elapsed time equal, or only
slightly more than now needed for the air route.
Obviously such highways, though of undubit-

planning ability of any limited area and call for
very close agreement and co-operation between all
the governmental units, towns, cities, counties and
states of the region traversed. The difficulty of co-
ordinating these independent units, with varying
political and financial policies, is the chief present
obstacle to their development. The highway engi-
neer, given the financial means and the backing of
public understanding, is already able to solve the
construction problems involved.
Triangles
Once more the Engineering Arch is neatly
scrubbed. Twice yearly it undergoes a much
needed bath at the hands of the pledges of Tri-
angles. This society is exclusively for Junior Engi-
neers and a man must be outstanding in some cam-
pus activity in order to be elected to membership.
On November 12, fourteen such men became
members o fthe organization. They are: Charles
R. Worst, member of the ''Knsian" staff; Vernon
Bishop, of the Business Department of the "Daily";
Hugh L. Baker. Chairman of the I.-Hop; Arthur K.
Kobison, member of the J-Hop Committee; DeEl-
ton J. Carr, of the Business Staff of the "Technic";
Jerry Gruitch, active in his class for three years;
Robert Hayes, Class Secretary and past local presi-
dent of Phi Eta Sigma: Earl Briggs, Class Treas-
urer and President of Sigma Rho Tau; Alistair
Mitchell, of the Student Council and the Engineer-
ing Council; Larry Harrow of the Engineering
Council; Emerson Reid, stellar hockey player; Bill
Williams, also of hockey fame: George Squibb, an-
other "Ensian" worker; and Erank Rilev, Varsity
Drum Major.
These men are all outstanding in the campus
life in many lines and are very worthy of the honor
conferred on them.
Pi Tau Pi Sigma
The initiation of Pi Tau Pi Sigma, Honorary Sig-
nal Corps Fraternity on November 6, 1931 con-
ferred the degree of active membership in that or-
ganization on seventeen Junior and Senior engi-
neers.
.They are: I). C. Apps, H. L. Baker. P. R. Berg-
man. (). K. Brown. A. II. Brundige, E. F. Corn-
stock. P. J. Firring, H. M. Lamb, B. H. Maddock,
D. S. McElwain. E. F. C. Persse, Geo. Rugge, J. H.
Schaefer, II. C,. Seamans, W. J. Simons, R. C.
Sperry. H. L. Verbriclge.
Professor Benjamin F. Bailey, head of the Elec-
trical Department, and Lt. Paul N. Young, a grad-
uate student, received honorary membership.
The informal initiation was held at Professor
Brier's cottage on Long Lake and later the formal
initiation and banquet were held at Inverness Coun-
try Club nearby.
Pi Tau Pi Sigma was founded at Wisconsin in
1921. It's membership is open to advanced
R. O. T. C. students of the Signal Corps. The pur-
poses of this organization are to raise the standard
of Signal Corps education and to bring its officers
into closer contact with each other. Patrick J. Mc-
Caughey '29 E.E., is now National President of the
Fraternity.
Distinguished French Architect Joins
Faculty
Appointment of Jean Hebrard, noted French
architect, to the position of Professor of Archi-
tectural Design, was announced by Professor Emil
Lorch, head of the University of Michigan College
of Architecture. Professor Hebrard will fill the
post left open by the death of Professor Albert J.
Rousseau.
Born in Paris, Jean Hebrard distinguished him-
self at the famous Ecoles des Beaux-Arts. From
1904 to 1926 he practiced in Paris, when he was
called to the University of Pennsylvania. He
quickly became recognized as one of the leading
teachers of architectural design in this country,
and brings to Michigan a long record of achieve-
ment in teaching and practice. o
Class Officers
At the present moment the engineering classes
are beginning to get organized for the year 1931-
32. The first step in such organization is always
the election of Class Officers, attended by the
usual campus politics.
The Senior officers are: Jack Beechler. President:
Marshall Anderson, Vice-President; John Camp-
bell, Secretary: Bill Crane, Treasurer; and Floyd
Schultz, Honor Committeeman.
The Junior election placed Hugh Baker as J-Hop
Chairman; Arthur Robison and Harold Seamans,
J-Hop Committeemen; Paul Rauff, President;
Harvey Bauss, Vice-President; Robert Hayes, Sec-
retary; Earl Briggs, Treasurer; Alistair Mitchell
and Larry Darrow, Engineering Councilmen; and
John Goetz, Honor Committeeman. The last six
offices mentioned were uncontested, the candidates
being elected unanimously.
The Sophomore Class chose Frederick L. John-
son, President; Dick McManus, Vice-President;
Lewis Westover, Secretary; Arthur B. Ebbers,
Treasurer; Richard G. Finch, Honor Committee-
man ; and Jim Heywood, Engineering Councilman.
The political bickerings caused a lot of men some
uneasy moments but it is all good experience, a lot
of fun, and a good way to get acquainted with the
various members of the class.

Typical engine room of a modern all-electric ship
POWER PLANTS AFLOAT
ELECTRICITY, having revolutionized industrial methods, is well on
its way to a conquest of the seas. Already, more than seventy
ships are propelled by electric energy — liners, merchantmen, tankers,
tugs, and every other type of seagoing craft.
Owners and masters alike praise the steady, dependable power — the
speed without vibration — the economy of operation — the conven-
ience of electric auxiliaries. Travelers have found new delight in the
extraordinary comfort of electric propulsion and in the luxury of
electric appliances.
The all-electric ship — a complete mobile power plant and system of
distribution — is largely the achievement of college-trained men who
have supplemented technical theory with practical experience in the
General Electric Company.
Many of these engineers are now maintaining the prestige of General
Electric not only in marine electrification but in every other depart-
ment of design and application. Others, newly graduated, are gaining,
in the Company's Test Department, a training which will enable
them to join the ranks of electrical leadership on land and sea.

EVERY user of Linde Oxygen is privileged to call upon Linde
Process Service for assistance or advice through any of the
25 Linde District Offices.
Linde Process Service, with its unequalled background of scien-
tific research and field experience, offers every facility for most
effective use of oxy-acetylene welding and cutting. Here are some
of the things it has done.
In the State of Washington, if developed a Procedure Control
for welding band saws, thus saving the lumber industry thousands
of dollars in replacement costs.
In Iowa, it showed a hosiery mill how to alter forms used in
the manufacture of silk stockings, and helped save a capital
expenditure of $16,000.
In New York, it showed a manufacturer how to apply iridium to
fountain pen points economically and without waste.
Tomorrow's engineers will be expected to know how to apply the
oxy-acetylene process of welding and cutting metals. For their
assistance, we have prepared several interesting technical book-
lets explaining how this modern metal-working process is used in
the design, construction, and fabrication of metal parts and struc-
tures. These books contain newer and more practical material
than most texts and will form a helpful addition to your personal
library. Write to us and we will send them to you without charge.

TO PROFESSION

GRADUATION, and then — ? To understand
the reactions of an individual to the change
from academic atmosphere, and collegiate so-
ciety to professional atmosphere and urban (or
urbane?) society, the personal character and the
type of education of that individual should be un-
derstood. One may not judge his own character
without prejudice but consider, however briefly, a
definite background of university life.
Seven years at the University of Michigan result-
ing in three degrees: B.S. in chemical engineering.
1925; M.S. in chemical engineering, specializing in
metallurgy, and received in 1926; and finally an
Sc.D. in metallurgy receive din 1929. From 1926 to
1929 the lad also held the position of teaching as-
sistant in metallurgy. As an undergraduate he re-
mained independent of fraternity life. In 1926 he
was elected to membership in Alpha Chi Sigma, a
professional fraternity, and to three honorary fra-
ternities.
As an undergraduate he had contacts with two
sports, baseball and track. There were dances, J-
Hops and architect's May Parties, canoeing on the
Huron, and the glorious color of football week-
ends. He had little to do with campus politics.
The undergraduate life at that time was dominated
by the golden voice and ruddy character of Presi-
dent Marion Leroy Burton. As a graduate the lad
lived a typical fraternity life and, through campus
politics, had a personal contact with the energetic
and impulsive young president, Clarence Cook
Little. A graduate course in philosophy led to con-
tact with Dr. Lloyd, the fine scholar and cultured
gentleman who served as acting president of the
university between the regimes of Burton and Little.
These few facts fix the period during which the
lad achieved an education and they serve to typify
that education. Obviously, when commencement
come in 1929, a transition became necessary—as
great a transition as that from high school to college
—hopes, desires, and imaginative pictures to be fol-
lowed by disillusionment, experience, adaptation,
and subsequent content. There is this to be known;
one may be content though unsatisfied. The man
who is dissatisfied should make a change of occupa-
tion or of living. The man who is content with the
present but unsatisfied as to the future will continue
to progress wherever he is.
When the time comes to obtain a job, the student
finds that many of the large organizations send con-
tact men from their personnel to interview those
who think they would like to work for these specific
concerns. Smaller companies, with opportunities
for new men, usually communicate their needs by
correspondence with the various department heads
of the university. About the only independent
means the student may use in search of work is cor-
respondence with some plant that he feels has, for
him, some particular advantages for work or of lo-
cation. The graduate student, with his special
training, should not overlook this latter method of
communication.
The lad has completed his examinations for the
doctor's degree and had his thesis about ready to
type before he took the time to seriously consider
definite opportunities. An excellent position, of-
fered by a visiting representative of a large electri-
cal concern, was open to him in Chicago. It is of
great importance, whenever it is possible, that the
student visit the plant where he intends to work,
understand the type of work that must be done, and
inspect the conditions under which he must live.
He should work and live where he may cultivate his
hobbies and personal interests and where he may

come to know such people as will prove to be his
friends.
While in Chicago, visiting the company that had
offered him a job, the lad discerned many things
that appeared to him to be disadvantages. Quite
probably other people would not have seen these
things in the same way. The organization of the
company appeared to be similar to an army sys-
tem. There was practically no personal freedom.
One or two friends of his, working for this concern,
appeared to have developed nervousness. The city,
itself, was very dirty and noisy. Unmarried men
lived in small cupboard-like rooms and young mar-
ried men lived in scrubby apartments. A restau-
rant, near the plant and patronized by the em-
ployees, had been "shot up" by gangsters the week
previously, several people being accidentally shot in
the hope of including the right individual. Need-
less to say, the lad did not accept the position with
this company.
He had heard a great deal about the work of the
research laboratories of the General Electric Com-
pany in Schenectady and felt that there might be
desirable work and good living conditions in the
East. This company sends men to the various col-
leges primarily to interview job-seeking seniors.
Men who work in the research laboratories have
generally made their contacts through friendly con-
nections or by their own individual action. Fol-
lowing personal correspondence with the head of
the metallurgical staff (the lad knew no one there),
he made a visit to the laboratories and inquired as
to the nature of living conditions. A position in
the research laboratories was offered to him and he
was more than glad to accept it.
Schenectady—deriving its name from an Indian
phrase—lies on the hill side of the Mohawk Valley.
This is a section of beautiful landscape and of
great historical interest. In pioneering days, when
the country was very young, the Mohawk Valley
was truly the Gateway to the West. Later, the
Erie Canal system and the Mohawk River became
an important artery in the system of industrial
transportation.
The spirit of the Research Laboratories is typified
in the personalities of such widely known scientists
as Dr. Willis R, Whitney, Dr. W. D. Coolidge, Dr.
One of the duties inherent to such justified reputa-
tions is that of teaching and leading the younger
men to work with greater efficiency and personal
ambition and to live happier lives. Contacts with
such men are invaluable to the young student about
to start his professional life. The man with post-
graduate education is well-equipped to benefit from
these ideal conditions of the finest leadership and
the best of apparatus and materials. There is a
spirit of comradeship that becomes a common de-
nominator for all degrees of authority and repu-
tation. Men of different station call each other by
their first names and there is a characteristic per-
sonal freedom in the performance of the duties that
constitute one's work.
The executive spirit of the organization is typi-
fied in the personalities of Owen D. Young and
Gerard Swope. These men—and the others with
them—who have formulated the spirit of service
and the methods for efficiency are the fit ideals and
leaders for the young college graduates who enter
the plant organization as "test men."
It is of interest to note that the successful man
of outstanding reputation follows some hobby with
the same intensity of purpose and enjoyment that
led him to his success. A list of these hobbies
proves of interest: The collection of arrow heads
and fossils; the habits of turtles; color photog-
raphy; camp life; radio; the saving of postage
stamps; the personal flying of privately owned
planes; hunting and fishing; canoeing, tennis, and,
of course, golf.
It is established that—exclusive of family life—
one should have the opportunity for happy recre-
ation as well as for satisfactory work. The com-
pany realizes that proper recreation leads a man
to give work of better quality. The Edison Clubs
owe their financial existence primarily to the com-
pany, itself. The purpose of these clubs is to place
recreation of the highest grade at the disposal of
the college graduates who become "test men".
The Edison Country Club is located 'upon the
steep bank of the Mohawk River. The beautiful
golf course consists of 27 holes and from many of
the tees may be seen the neighboring mountains.
There are fine tennis courts and even croquet for
the golf widows. One large building houses the
lockers, showers, a lunch counter, the club pro-
fessional's shop, and floor space for summer dances.
A second fine building contains lounge rooms, a
radio, meeting rooms, dining rooms and kitchen.
The large veranda, overlooking the river, may be
set with dining tables or used for bridge parties.
Most of these facilities are also available to the
women.
The Edison City Club consists of three buildings.

By WALTER C. SADLER
Associate Professor of Railroad Engineering
The
Lawyer's
Club
FR some five years a young engineer by the
lame of John Smith had been in the employ
of Mr. Erwin, a consulting engineer of long
experience. Smith desires to form a partnership
with the older man. He argues that he has demon-
strated his ability to handle the office details and
even suggests that an association would be a dis-
tinct advantage to Mr. Erwin, permitting the older
engineer to devote his time exclusively to the
larger problems of this practice. Mr. Erwin is in-
terested in the proposition and sends Smith a
memorandum to determine the young engineer's
position on the following points:
a. Assets which each partner will contribute
to the association.
b. Duties, responsibilities, and authority
of each partner.
c. Remuneration which each partner is to
receive from time to time.
d. Proposed duration of the agreement.
e. Provisions for early dissolution of part-
nership if either partner so desires.
f. Division of the partnership property
upon dissolution.
g. Effect of admission of new members to
the partnership.
h. Legal steps necessary to form this asso-
ciation.
i. How far each member will be bound by
the engineering contacts which he is
now developing.
Smith suddenly perceives that there is more to
his scheme than he at first realized, and that good
business would dictate that he become better
acquainted with the subject before proceeding fur-
ther. But his lack of knowledge on this matter is
not startling. Partnerships are so common in our
everyday business activities that we give little
thought to their legal significance. It is true we
know that any partner may be personally liable
for all the debts of the firm; or that the death of a
partner may dissolve the relationship. But general
knowledge does not extend much further than this.
It would seem, however, that engineers and archi-
tects should give some thought of this legal re-
lationship. It is the type of organization used by
many contractors and material supply companies.
In fact, professional men themselves use this form
of combine, the better to conduct their business ac-
tivities. It would be well ,therefore, to examine
closely the details of a partnership.
The Michigan law, sec. 6, Chap. 191, Compiled
Laws defines a partnership as an association of two
or more persons to carry on as co-owners a busi-
ness for a profit. It seems, in general, that an
association set up for social or charitable pur-
poses would not come within this definition. Thus,
if a number of students should group themselves
together to have meetings and discuss engineering
problems, such club wfould not be a partnership.
If one member should purchase a glider for the club
on his own initiative no other individual member
would be liable for any part of the unpaid bill. The
law specifically requires that in order to have the
association considered a partnership it must be
formed for business purposes, and this club was
not. That point is clear enough.
The requirement of "profits" is more compli-
cated. Smith a mill owner, hires Jones to cut tim-
ber and haul it to his mill. Jones is to be paid a
percentage of the money Smith receives on the sale
of the timber. Jones buys a team of horses for this
work and the issue is raised whether Smith may be
held as a partner for the bill on the horses which
Jones has not paid. Let us say that the contract
between Jones and Smith even goes so far as to call
this status between them a "partnership". This is
not a case of division of profits, however, but a
way of figuring wages. The agreement made no
mention of deducting the expenses of the mill, etc.
In a Michigan case, Klein vs Kirschbaum, 215 N.W.
289, it was held that participation in profits as
wages, does not authorize the inference of partner-
ship. This seems reasonable in view of certain
common engineering cases. For instance, if a su-

IN THE study of the stability of solid bodies the
energy required to change the position is used
as a Criteri. If positive energy must iie ex-
pended to change the position of a body it is said
to be stable, if the position can be changed with-
out effort the body has neutral stability, if the bod)
once disturbed supplies its own energy for change
of position it is said to be unstable. As illustrative
examples: a ball resting on a surface that is con-
cave upward is stable because energy is required to
dislodge it. A ball on a plane level surface is in a
state of neutral stability, a ball on a surface that
is concave downward is unstable because when
disturbed energy to change position is supplied at
the expense of potential energy.
A body floating on the water follows similar
laws which admit of a method of approach for the
study of the stability problem that is rarely used.
When a body is placed in the water an amount of
work is done on the water equal to WF foot
pounds, where W is the weight of the displaced
water and Y is the distance from the water surface
to the center of buoyancy (the center of gravity of
the displaced water). Proof of this follows: Con-
sider Figure A. The element of displaced water of
cross-section parallel to the water dA and of height
h was displaced at the expense of energy. Start-
ing from zero displacement the upward force on the
bottom of the element built up to whdA where w
is the weight per unit volume of water. This rep-
resents an amount of energy for the element of

potential energy as it sinks into the water, using
the water level as a datum plane this energy is
\\Z where Z is the depth below the surface of the
center of gravity and W is the weight of the body.
The potential energy E possessed by the body is
then E = W(K-Z).
From the law of conservation of energy it is ob-
vious that a body will float stably in the position in
which it possesses a minimum of potential energy
or W(K-Z) is a minimum because in this position
of floatation energy must be supplied to cause a
change of position. The quantity (Y-Z) is the
distance between center of gravity and center of
buoyancy of the floating body and the stable posi-
tion for a given body is the one making this dis-
tance a minimum, W being constant. When mis-
cellaneous bodies are floated the position taken
by each body can soon be determined by apply-
ing this law. In the case of prismatical bodies such
as logs and timbers it is only necessary to com-
pare the values of (Y-Z) for three positions. If a
body be placed in the water in a position such that
(Y-Z) is not a minimum there is available energy
stored in the water capable of raising the center
of buoyancy so that such a position is unstable.

OF ARCHITECTURE
By LOUIS LaBEAUME
OF ALL the arts with which the Anglo Saxon
world concerns itself, the art of Pugilism
alone is known as the manly art. It is high
time that something should he done about it.
There are many arts, as everyone who will give
the matter a little thought must realize, that call
for more downright physical stamina, more brute
endurance, as high a quality of head-work, manual
dexterity and seriousness of purpose. It is a very
pretty sight, of course, to watch two fast boys
pummel each other; and such exhibitions of virility
quite naturally win our plaudits. These clever art-
ists call upon us to witness their struggle, and hav-
ing witnessed we are impressed. They seem in
deadly earnest as they stand before us stripped of
all the impedimenta of civilization. They are
trained in the technique of what we are pleased to
call a practical art.
Usually the two words, "practical", and "artistic",
are not found in such close juxtaposition. They are
supposed to mean quite different things. The man
who prides himself on being practical is often a
little skittish at sight of the word artistic; and the
man who thinks himself artistic as frequently
winces, alas, at the mere sound of the word prac-
tical. This sensitiveness in either case is deplor-
able, and is the base result of our incorrigible de-
sire to ticket and label the manifestations of the
human intelligence. There are different degrees of
intelligence, as there are different intellectual pre-
occupations. We denominate a gesture or an action
practical when we feel that it is prompted by rea-
son, and the definition serves us well enough as far
as it goes. Did we not pull it up short and confine
it to the prosaic affairs of material existence all
would be well. But there is an extension of reason
which opens up new vistas of possible or ideal ac-
tivity; and in order to differentiate it from hum-
drum everyday reason, we call it imagination. It
remains reason none the less, and is inexorable in
the straight course it pursues from cause to effect.
We speak of the fruits of the imagination as Art;
as we refer to Poetry, Music, Painting, Sculpture,
Architecture as works of the Imagination. But
from the beginning we may suppose that men have
regarded the doer as the practical fellow and the
deviser as the dreamer. It is an obvious though
perhaps shallow differentiation that satisfied the
amour propre of both. But who is bold enough to
say upon reflection that he who shaped the flint
and fashioned the bow was one whit less practical
than he who sped the arrow? Artists they both
were, each in his metier, the one, in his cunning,
stalking the visible quarry, the other visualizing it
in his mind's eye, and slaying it with a shaft sprung
from his brain.
So called men of action are prone to regard
themselves as the lusty fellows who do the real
work of the world, sweating under the heat of the
noonday sun, freezing in the icy waters off the
Banks of Newfoundland, and bringing back the
carnivora, or the cod, to the stay-at-homes who
sent them after it. They can hardly fail to magni-
fy the importance of their own adventures as they
contemplate their catch of fish, their stack of blue
chips, the mountains of metals, or produce, which
their tired arms have piled up. Quite naturally
perhaps they look upon the painter, the poet, the
sculptor and the architect as indolent fellows, who
play idly with illusions and avoid the stern facts
of life which test the mettle of the he-man.
And the artist himself has sometimes drooped
into a tacit acceptance of their verdict, assuming
the romantic posture of the troubador, the enter-
tainer, the master of pageants and masques, the
graceful decorator. He has flattered his own self
love by asserting a kind of spiritual arrogance to be

THK windowless building1, that revolutionary
idea which aroused much comment and crit-
icism when it was discussed at the last
Architectural and Allied Arts Exposition, is now
a reality.
Today, this theory of utilizing all-artificial light-
ing and ventilating and constructing a building
without windows, is actually being carried out.
When the subject was discussed by Francis Keally,
New York architect and a member of the Archi-
tectural League of New York in a lecture at the
last big exposition, it was criticized in many quar-
ters as representing only a theory and one of doubt-
ful practical value, but its application now to a
million and a half dollar industrial plant, at pres-
ent in process of construction, demonstrates the
revolutionary trends at work in architectural prac-
tices. With solid wall and roof construction,
punctuated neither by windows nor skylights, this
new industrial plant, will cover nearly two city
blocks and contain five acres of floor space.
So far as is known, this plant which is being
erected for a Fitchburg, Mass., manufacturing plant
by a Cleveland engineering firm, will be the coun-
try's first example of the windowless building.
However, plans are now under way for such a
building at the Chicago World's Fair. In the com-
plete exhibits of models and drawings of the Chi-
cago Fair buildings to be shown at the Architectur-
al and Allied Arts Exposition to be held at Grand
Central Palace in April, windowless construction
will be illustrated by the huge Travel and Trans-
port Building to be erected for the Chicago World's
Fair group. A few rare examples are said to ex-
ist in Europe, notably a large film studio near Ber-
lin.
When interviewed, as an architect advocat-
ing the windowless buildings for problems to
which it logically applies, Francis Keally expressed
the opinion that this type of construction was feas-
ible for a factory because it was conducive to better
working conditions. The uniformity of artificial
light as compared with varying daylight conditions
dependent upon the location and cleanliness of win-
dows and upon the weather, the increased amount
of ultra-violet rays possible through the use of
lamps rather than through intermittent sunlight, an
unchanging temperature, and quieter working con-
ditions through the elimination of outside noises
and the use of noise-absorbing construction, were
among the points which Mr. Keally emphasized as
arguments in favor of the windowless building for
industrial use.
Reduction of fire hazards by elimination of the
danger of fire-communication through windows was
mentioned by this architect as another thing in fa-
vor of the solid walls. Economy is also an im-
portant factor, Mr. Keally explained, saying that it
is not only cheaper to construct a solid wall than to
building a well with windows, but the loss through
breakage and the upkeep, repairs, and cleaning, rep-
resent additional savings.
Another of his arguments concerns the health-
fulness of the artificial ventilating system by means
of which clean air, free of dust and germs, is sup-
plied. Air-conditioning, he pointed out, has met
with success in our theatres, large office buildings
and department stores, particularly in making these
buildings more comfortable during the summer
heat. Many scientific experiments now being made
substantiate the health-arguments made for arti-
ficial ventilation.
The windowless building now under construction
is a big manufacturing plant being erected at Fitch-
burg, Mass., for the Simonds Saw &amp; Steel Co., by
the Austin Company, contractors of Cleveland,
Ohio. It is American industry's first windowless
factory, and embodies many radically advanced
ideas about the scientific creation of ideal light and
working conditions. Confidence in a rapid business
recovery was expressed by A. T. Simonds, president
of the 100-year-old saw manufacturing concern, in
announcing the new building. Based on this con-
fidence and on the belief that present construction
costs are favorable for immediate expansion to an-
ticipate future needs, the officials of the company
proceeded with their plans for a $1,500,000 plant, he
stated.
Elaborate systems will be installed in the build-
ing for lighting, ventilating, and the absorption of
noise. A vast amount of research was undertaken
to ascertain the psychological and physiological re-

action of workmen under various conditions of light,
temperature, sounds and color, and it is upon this
research that the builders are basing their plans for
the all-artificial lighting and ventilating of the plant
and the use of color on machinery and walls. The
lighting system will be arranged to supply ultra-
violet rays. In carrying out this plan, it is the de-
sire of the manufacturers to surround their em-
ployees with the best possible working conditions,
and innovations conducive to the health, safety and
freedom from nervous strain and unnecessary
fatigue. They believe that their experiments will
result in increased efficiency and happier working
conditions.
A type of building which Mr. Keally believes is
particularly suited to the use of windowless con-
struction is the department store. Contending that
the large floor area of the modern department store
is now largely dependent on artificial light, and that
the daylight penetrates to only a limited portion of
it, he pointed out that solid wall construction would
create valuable interior display space and uniform
artificial light and ventilation would be preferable
to present practices. He proposes the use of a
single window on each floor, in the center of the
facade, for the penetration of daylight at one point
to meet a demand for natural light in selecting mer-
chandise. The value of the large window display
space on the ground floor is, of course, not disputed
by the architect in advocating solid wall construc-
tion for the upper floors.
Many other designs for windowless or semi-win-
dowless buildings will be included, it is believed,
among the numerous contemporary architectural
exhibits being assembled for the April Architectural
and Allied Arts Exposition, the fourth biennial
event of its kind, which will be held under the au-
spices of both the Architectural League of New
York and the American Institute of Architects.
The Architect's Bookshelf
THE HISTORY AND IDEALS OF AMERICAN ART.
By Euhen Ncuhaus. (Stanford University Press. Stan-
ford University, California. 1931. $6.50.)
In writing this survey of American pictorial art,
Euhen Neuhaus, Professor of Art at Stanford Uni-
versity, says that his purpose "is to put in the hands
of students a historical and aesthetic analysis of
American art and of the outside influences which
shaped its course from its meager beginnings in the
New England States to its rich harvest of the pres-
ent day all over the country, in the hope that such
a survey may develop a pride in our artistic achieve-
ments and also may contribute to the formation of
god taste."
The author achieves at least half of this pur-
pose in fostering an appreciation for the wealth of
artistic material to be found in this comparatively
young country, by his excellent selection of work
ranging from the early "limners" to the latest of
post-impressionists. His treatment of these works,
which appear in photolithography at the beginning
of each chapter, is divided in the text along two
lines. His first idea is to trace the various influ-
ences derived from Europe and elsewhere which
have helped to shape American art; and second, to
associate artists by subject affinity.
He begins with portrait work done before the
Revolution, which was scanty and rather spas-
modic. As Balch indicates, "it could not have been
pleasant posing for one's portrait where the sitting
might be suddenly interrupted by a Redman sneak-
ing up behind the back fence and shooting a stone-

WHEN R. K. Hall applied physical chemistry
to the control of boiler-water conditions he
rendered an inestimable service to boiler
operators. His work described in his well-known
bulletin and in numerous publications has stimulat-
ed many other investigations. The one described
in the present paper is a logical development from
Hall's pioneering efforts. While the authors be-
lieve that the present paper modifies the numerical
value of Hall's SO4—CO3 ratio to an important de-
gree, they feel that their investigations in no way
detract from the brilliance of Hall's earlier efforts.
It seemed probable to the authors that the true
value of the SO.,—CO3 ratio must be appreciably
greater than the value of calculated by Hall. As
a result a program of research at the University of
Michigan was sponsored by the Detroit Edison
Company in order to determine more accurately, if
possible, the solubility relations in boiler waters.
The research on this project was carried on con-
tinuously from February, 1929, to July, 1931.
Methods of Deriving the SO4—CO:) Ratio
Only a brief comparison of Hall's derivation of
his SO4—CO., ratio and of the present authors'
method of evaluating this ratio will be given in this
paper, since the subject has been discussed in a
more complete form in a paper presented before the
American Chemical Society which is to be published
soon. The purpose of the present paper is to place
the results before boiler operators for discussion.
Hall's Derivation. Hall evaluated the SO4—CO3
ratio for the simultaneous existence of solid anhy-
drite (CaSOJ and solid calcite (CaCO:)) in equili-
brium with a boiler water at a given temperature by
using the concept of the solubility product. His
method of derivation is open to three criticisms.
The first of these is that a boiler steaming at a high
rating may not actually approach an equilibrium
condition, but instead the boiler water may be more
or less supersaturated with respect to either anhy-
drite or calcite or both substances. The second
criticism is that Hall made a long extrapolation of
Kendall's uncertain data for the solubility of calcite
in the range up to 100 deg. cent, in order to obtain
the solubility product for calcite at boiler tempera-
tures. The third point is that Hall's use of the
ionization data of Noyes involves considerable un-
certainty, since it leads to rather large variations in
the value of the solubility product, which theoretic-
ally should be a constant. Hall himself noted these
variations, but since the fluctuations for both anhy-
drite and calcite were in the same direction, he as-
sumed that they would largely cancel out in the
ratio.
A New Method of Evaluating Hall's Ratio. Most
boiler waters fall in the range of dilute solutions as
usually defined by the physical chemist. It seemed,
therefore, that it might be profitable to apply some
of the newer developments in the field of dilute
solutions to the study of boiler-water equilibria.
Some years ago Lewis and Randall had discussed
their development of the activity concept with re-
lation to dilute solutions, and Debye and Hiickel
subsequently supplied a highly mathematical the-
oretical substantiation of the empirical conclusions
reached by Lewis and Randall. It is interesting to
note that the Debye-Hiickel theory has recently
been applied to the field of boiler-water chemistry
by McKinney.
The present authors started from Lewis Randall's

the total concentration of a dilute solution and of
the "mean molality" as a measure of the solubility
•of a saturating substance in such a solution. The
ionic strength, represented by the symbol /*, is de-
fined by the equation,
where the brackets represent the respective sums
of the concentrations of all the uni-valent, bivalent,
and tri-valent ions present in the solution under con-
sideration. Concentrations are customarily express-
ed in mnls per 1000 grams of solution and are stoi-
chiometric values involving no theoretical consider-
ations of ionization. The mean molality for a sub-
stance such as CaSO4 or CaCO3 is the square root
of the product [Ca][SO4] or [Ca][CO.,], stoichio-
metric values again being used. In considering
the equilibrium between CaSO4 and CaCO3 it is
possible to save one step in the calculation of data
by using, instead of the mean molality, merely the
products [Ca][SO4] and [Ca][CO3].
For all dilute solutions saturated with respect to
anhydrite the values of some function of the product
|Ca] [SO4J plotted against the values of some func-
tion of the ionic strength should define a curve or
a narrow band. In other words, the solubility of
anhydrite as expressed in terms of [Ca][SO4j
should be approximately constant for all solutions
of the same ionic strength regardless of the specific
composition of these solutions. For actual use it
is convenient to plot log [Ca][SO4] and log [Ca]
[CO3] against /n.^. If a sufficient number of com-
plete analyses were available for solutions saturated
at a given temperature with either anhydrite or cal-
cite or both solid phases, it would be possible by
plotting the results in the manner described to de-
fine a range within which points for anhydrite fall
and another range in which the points for calcite
fall. If these ranges were narrow, they might be
represented by single curves. The equilibrium
value of the SO4 — CO3 ratio at any given ionic
strength might then be determined from the differ-
ence in ordinate of these curvs, since
|Ca][S04]
[Ca][C03] [C03]
for a solution saturated with respect to both anhy-
drite and calcite. Converting this equation to
logarithmic form yields,
log ( [Ca] [SO.] )-log([Ca][CO.])= log
The difference in ordinate of the curves is then the
logarithm of the desired equilibrium SO4— COa
ratio.
The Evaluation of the SO4— CO:, Ratio
The method outlined was used in determining the
SO4 — CO:, ratio at 185 deg. cent, corresponding to

significance of the diagram will be treated here.
Discussion of Data. In spite of wide variations in
the composition of the various solutions the points
for anhydrite define a curve fairly well. The points
for calcite, however, spatter considerably. The
authors see three possible explanations for this re-
sult. In the first place, two crystal forms of cal-
cium carbonate have been reported in boiler scale.
These are aragonite and calcite, the latter being the
more stable form. Presumably these two forms
have differing solubilities. While aragonite is prob-
ably the less stable form under boiler-water condi-
tions, it might persist for considerable periods of
time. In addition, it is possible that fluctuations in
boiler-water composition might cause reversal from
calcite to aragonite, although this is improbable.
The second explanation, which seems plausible to
the authors, is that the various solutions even at a
temperature of 185 deg. cent, may remain super-
saturated with respect to calcium carbonate for
long periods of time, and that the degree of super-
saturation may vary considerably. The third ex-
planation would be inaccuracy in the sampling
methods and analytical procedure used in connection
with the experimental boiler. Sampling was car-
ried out with an internal filter and a cooling coil to
reduce the filtered solution to room temperature be-

Educational Values at Par Plus
During these days of overwhelming depression,
we sometimes wonder whether the undergraduate
of today realizes how fortunate he is to be at school
laying up a store of knowledge, rather than being
out in the world, facing almost insurmountable odds
trying to earn a living. In the seclusion of our nar-
rowed world we are very apt to overlook the trage-
dies going on outside our limited sphere, and un-
derestimate the battle being fought by those who
are driven to extremes to eke out a precarious ex-
istence.
Today many of us are in school solely because
of a great sacrifice by ourselves or by those close
to us. The additional burden of sending a boy to
college is much greater for the average family to
bear now, than what it was several years ago.
All of which brings up to the question "What
can the present day student do to reciprocate in
some way for the privilege of being in school in
days like these?" We would answer that it is up
to the student to secure the most possible out of
his college education. This, of course, holds true
always but it is even more apparent today when
real value must be received for money invested.
Put an extra push into your class-room work.
Study as if you meant it. Go to it as if you
were pulling yourself out of a "depression". Sup-
port your college. Engage in some extra-curricu-
lar activity. Get maximum value for time and
money spent. The newspapers all cry that most
commodities are down to their lowest price in
years. It is up to the student himself to see that
the cost of education is clown to the lowest price
in years by getting a better education and more of
it for the same amount of money expended.
Engineering by^ Radio
It is doubtful if very many students on campus
follow the University of Michigan broadcasts given
over station WJR, for their tangible contact with
the many lectures, forums and activities sponsored
in Ann Arbor amply supply their cultural needs.
There are many people, however, scattered through-
out Michigan and the surrounding states, to whom
these opportunities are relatively inaccessible and
who are interested in following the University
broadcasts as a routine educational device. These
programs have been well received, and much good
work is being done.
From time to time members of the Engineering
College staff have been called upon to discuss, in a
non-technical fashion, some phase of their work.
One of the more ambitious projects along this line
is a series of Saturday night talks, which are being

engineer and director of the University Department
of Engineering Research. In these talks Professor
White has concerned himself with how modern
research, especially in fields allied to industry, has
affected our business and manufacturing worlds,
and how it may be expected to operate in the fu-
ture.
The last talk of the series is scheduled for De-
cember 19, and is entitled "Research and Business
Cycles." This will doubtless develop material
pertinent to the current depression and should be
illuminating in the matter of its workings.
We, here, take all these sources of knowledge
for granted. Only when we consider what college
would be without them do we realize their true
worth to us as student.
New Books in the East Engineering Library
The library on the third floor of East engineering
building, covering the subjects of Chemical and
Aeronautical Engineering and Engineering Eng-
lish, is one of the best technical libraries to be
found on this campus or in the state. The material
here partially covers those subjects which are of
interest to the under-classmen but more completely
fills the needs of the advanced and graduate groups.
This month they have received the following new
volumes:

National Engineering Prize
Won by Student
Robert Elmer Klise, SpE, has been named winner
of the Charles T. Main Award for 1931, offered by
the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, for
his paper on "Interchangeability, Its Development
and Significance in Industry." Formal presentation
of the award, which included $150 in money, took
place on December first at the annual meeting of
the Society in New York City.
Winning of the Main Award is regarded as a
high honor for the individual and his school. Any
student member of the American Society of Me-
chanical Engineers may compete, and this year
many members of the 108 student branches of the
Society submitted papers on the chosen topic. Sub-
jects for competition are chosen from problems con-
fronting engineering, and must be solved independ-
ently and with originality by the contestant.
Little Known Occupations
Who ever thought of the chemist in connection
with such a caption? A few illustrations will show
that the chemist's occupation is exactly of such a
nature. Every day, some chemist is advancing
civilization a step further, yet receiving no credit
or compensation. Who ever thinks of the fellow
who conceived the idea of adding camphor to the
nitrate of cellulose giving a clear, plastic leaf as
a great hero—an Edison or a Lindbergh? Yet,
that fellow's arduous work resulted in the basis
of the photographic industry. Then there is the
unnamed friend of the housewife who discovered
the secret of rising bread—and probably brought
it to its present level, and the man who just re-
cently coated paper plates with Titanium Oxide
and water glass to give a fine white plate, porce-
lain in appearance, in which pies, cakes and other
baked goods can be baked and sold, and yet pre-
senting a very enticing appearance to the wary
customer. It is just such things—common things,
we say, which are before us and in use every day,
whose inventors are unknown to us and their
arduous labors unrewarded.
To the everyday layman, these tasks are of little
significance, but to you and I, they should not be
manna, but products of laboring minds such as we
would all have.

SPOT
HUGH
CONKLIN,
'32E
IT is with a very pleased feeling that we are able,
upon occasion, to point out that the sphere of
general campus activities is not sacred to the
leisure-encumbered inmates of the literary school.
Beyond question, a successful invasion of the
Daily, Gargoyle, 'Ensian, Union, or other extra-
curricular activity may often call for a too definite
divorce from the slide-rule and log tables. Then,
be it said, the more power to him who can make the
grade.
Statistics are not our specialty, so we cannot say
• how many years it has been since an engineer was
last a President of the Michigan Union. But that
wouldn't prove anything anyway, so permit us to
introduce this year's Prexy, Hugh Conklin. Smile
for the readers, Hugh! He says that he won't.
(Note picture.)
We decided to invade the sanctum sanctorum at
the Union for an interview with the Conklin. It
was fast approaching darkness, but not a light was
to be seen. Hence it was with some difficulty that
we were finally persuaded that Hugh was among
those present. Apparently the cry of the present
regime is "Economy", but we were received with a
whole lot more hospitality than the last time that
we stepped into the same room, and had a past re-
cording secretary smoke up half a package of our
cigarettes.
Hugh was the most annoyingly modest person
in the world insofar as talking about himself went.
It was almost in the nature of a concession that he
divulged that Battle Creek is his home town, and,
if nothing else, one can safely wager that Hugh
will never be caught bragging. For example, he
pleaded guilty to winning numerals his freshman
year, and then refused to name the sport, saying
that it wasn't important anyway.
Your informant, by way of being coy, raised the
question of how many League dances Hugh had
attended, to which he blurted out that he had only
been to one Union dance in the time that he had been
on campus, or something like that. Sensing that he
had made a slip of the tongue, he impetuously
added, by way of explanation, that he never dates
the campus co-eds. We applauded, and poor Hugh,
now helplessly floundering, was past further ex-
planations. Due to the previously mentioned dark-
ness, the world will never know how beautifully
Hugh Conklin blushed. And if he shoots us for
giving him away, it's our own darned fault.
Hugh's appointment to his present post came as a
reward for his work as chairman of the Union
house committee last year. Under his administra-
tion the upperclassman advisor system has been
placed into effect this year, and plans are being
formulated for a sort of museum to house relics,
documents and kin material pertinent to the history
of the Union. He also anticipated a point that we
were about to raise by stating that the Union
showers were to be thoroughly overhauled this
year. (Some of our student readers may recall
the heated arguments in last year's Dailies about
said showers.)
Hugh has the gentlemanly qualities so much
sought after and so rarely attained in one person;
good looks, poise, modesty, and above all the
ability to do things, to set a goal and by persis-
tency, hard work, and good management to reach
that goal. Such are the facts established by his
campus record.
Hugh is a member of Triangles, junior honor-
ary engineering, and Michigamua. His office also
automatically places him on the Student Council
and the Senate Committee on Student Affairs.
The fact remains, however, in the vernacular of
one of our playmates, that Hugh is "a good to-
mato". Delta Kappa Epsilon should be proud of
him.

.IGHT
WELL, well! Peck's Bad Boy. alias Roddy-
Clark, in our nice spotlight. Good old
Roddy seems to be unable to resist the
temptation to crash the gate again—(if it is per-
missible to stoop to slang).
We'll bet that Rod must have been a very dis-
concerting freshman when he hied down from
Pontiac to fill out his first registration blanks.
But despite the fact that he has a boisterous ve-
neer that an axe couldn't fracture, we still like his
line and are prepared to endorse him and even in-
troduce him to our best friends. There is some-
thing naive about his cheerful and irrepressible
spontaneity that is as disarming as it is amusing,
and breezy as our young hero is, it is all in good
fun.
Among his other shining qualities is an impreg-
nable armor against consternation. The good old
"Murad" would surely go out of existence if it
depended upon him to smoke it during his embar-
rassing moments. He himself is author of the
statement that he could spill a cup of hot coffee on
a coed's nice new formal the night of the J-Hop
without even so much as blushing or batting an
eyelash.
A seasoned tennis player, Roddy acquired the
all-campus singles titles and had a half interest in
the spring doubles cup during his freshman year.
The following year he made his "M" with the var-
sity squad, playing as high as number two man for
a time. But, as will happen upon occasion, some
bad luck made Rod ineligible for the past season.
Since that time, however, he has come to recog-
nize the virtues of studying more enthusiastically
and is ready for an even more successful session
with the team this coming spring. And just to
prove that the tennis is still sound, he barnstormed
tournaments this past summer and performed in a
very creditable manner, lifting the Pontiac City
championship among other things.
When those tennis aces, Bill Tilden and the
Irishman, Burke, came to town to play a match
for the enlightenment of the Michigan racquet
ROLLIN W.
CLARK, JR.,
'32E
wielders and admirers of the sport, Roddy was
right there acting as linesman and, we daresay,
mentally noting how the game of each man could
have been improved.
Politics have been tolerably good to Roddy. His
sophomore year saw him chairman of the jackets
committee, and in this connection Rod acquired
much of his fame. He decided that the class of
1932 should have jackets of a previously unex-
ploited color, so it could be none other than brown.
We would like to reassure Rod that his choice will
remain unique for some time, but we have heard
tell of people who really liked the '32 jackets. In
any event he was elected class treasurer his junior
year and had made Triangles, but that was prob-
ably because the author of the scandal had not
yet been exposed.
We are beginning to think that we have roasted
Rod enough and that it is high time that we are
nice. Someone has said that man is primarily a
social creature, and Roddy is at least sociable. We
have always admired his polished, easy dancing
and have been trying unsuccessfully for years to
master his technique.
Of late he has become interested in illumination
and indirect lighting, being an apprentice electrical
engineer, and we expect to find a multiplicity of
thousand watt bulbs and aluminum reflectors the
next time that we visit his room. \Ve hope that he
won't persuade us to give up our nice fifteen watt
units, but he probably will.
In his early days on Campus he tried for a posi-
tion on the "Technic" staff but found that it con-
flicted too much with his tennis and social activi-
ties. Since his Freshman year his cheerful pres-
ence has been an ornament to Theta Chi.

OUR PROFESSORS
A New Department of Brief Interviews
with the Faculty
Professor
Alfred H.
White
FEW men can be said to have served on the
University of Michigan faculty for a longer
period of active service than Prof. Alfred H.
White, head of the Department of Chemical Engi-
neering,—and this statement of fact carries a spe-
cial significance.
We quote from the words of Prof. Walter Bad-
ger that at the turn of the century a chemical en-
gineer was a man, trained as a chemist, who usu-
ally got his engineering from actual contact with
the chemical and allied industries. At that time
there were few universities that taught chemical
engineering, per se, for it was too new a develop-
ment as a phase of engineering. So it will not sur-
prise us to learn that Professor White graduated
with the degree of A. B. at Michigan, after attend-
ing McGill University in Montreal for a year. Fol-
lowing this he acted as an assistant in chemistry at
the University of Illinois for three years and then
specialized in chemical technology at the Polytech-
nicum in Zurich, Switzerland, for another year.
In 1897 he returned to Michigan as an instructor
in chemical technology, and the following year saw
the establishment of the Department of Chemical
Engineering in the University. Professor White
secured the degree of B.S. in Ch.E. in 1904, and
at this time he was made an assistant professor of
chemical engineering. Three years later he as-
sumed the full professorship. It is obvious, there-
fore, that Professor White had witnessed the cre-
ation of his department while a member of the
faculty, and he has kept it under his wing since. It
was in 1914 that he was appointed head of the de-
partment.
Professor \Vhite, in the meantime, had acted as
consulting engineer to the U.S. Bureau of Mines
during the period 1907-20. In May, 1917, he was
made a captain in the Ordnance Department of the
Reserve Corps, and on Jan. 21, 1918, he saw active
service as a lieutenant colonel and acted as chief
of the research section and association chief of the
nitrate division of the Ordnance Department.
From these duties he was honorably discharged on
July 1, 1919, and was at that time commissioned
as a lieutenant colonel in the reserves. For the
next three years, however, he remained as con-
sulting engineer to the Ordnance Dept., and in
1925 was promoted to the rank of colonel, O.R.C.
In connection with this office, Professor White
was in charge of the Ordnance Reserve Training
Center which was held at the University of Michi-
gan from August 2 to 15 of this year. The men who
attended this school will be among the officers in
charge of "loading plants" in the event of another
war.
Professor White was in charge of another kind
of school that was held at Michigan this past sum-
mer. This latter was under the auspices of the
Society for the Promotion of Engineering Edu-
cation, which each year holds summer meeting^ for
particular phases of engineering in the interests of
bringing forth better methods of instruction in that
field. About two such schools are held each year,
and at that which met here last summer on chem-
ical engineering, faculty members of some 68 col-
leges were in attendance.
Professor White's main fields of interest are gas
and cement. He has contributed upwards of 60 re-
search papers in various technical journals, main-
ly concerning these two industries and the fixation
of nitrogen. He has, however, published but one
book, the well-known "Technical Gas and Fuel
Analysis".
His society memberships include Phi Beta
Kappa, Sigma Xi, Tau Beta Pi, Phi Lambda
Upsilon, the American Chemical Society, the
American Society for Testing Materials, the
American Institute of Chemical Engineers (of
which he was president for the period 1929-31),
the American Gas Association, the Michigan Gas
Association (president for 1930-31), and the Amer-
ican Legion. He is also a member of the Univer-
sity Council and on the Committee of Educational
Policies of that body.

Who They Are and
What They Are Doing
John D.
Ackerman
'25E
NEW discoveries in the world of invention and
the new sciences which have developed from
these discoveries have opened up so many
new branches of industry in the last century that
it has been appropriately entitled "The Age of In-
dustrialism". Probably the most recent of the en-
gineering professions to forge into ranking im-
portance with the major industries is that of aero-
nautical engineering, the history of which has been
highly colored, a page of romantic adventure and
intrepid adventures. It has zoomed hundreds of
men into national prominence within the last decade
and opened wide the way for a new era to come. It
demands recognition and has been receiving it so
universally that we welcome the chance to honor
one of its most famous champions in these pages.
Michigan's outstanding contributor to the prog-
ress of aeronautics was one of the first graduates
of one of the first engineering colleges to organize
a separate department devoted exclusively to the
study of aeronautical engineering. His life reads
like a story from fiction, athriller in Horatio Alger
style. It is certainly more than worthy of repre-
senting a new industry's progress and is offered
here in the hope that it may provide its readers
with as much inspiration as can be gained from
such a well started career.
Professor John D. Akerman began his experi-
ence with aviation in nineteen sixteen when he
joined the Imperial Russian Air Forces and stu-
died the science of flying under Professor N. E.
Joukowski in the city of Moscow. Then, in rapid
succession, came a series of unfortunate events. He
spent a few brief but unholy months of service on
the World War Fronts, three nights of terror and
fear for his life during the breaking of the Red
Revolution, several hours engineering a frantic but
successful escape from a land seething with anar-
chy, and several months completing a frightened
flight to the United States. Thus landing in New
York in 1918, penniless and unable to speak a word
of English, Professor Akerman faced such barren
prospects that it seems almost a miracle that he
could have achieved such a meteoric rise. After
struggling along from hand to mouth for a couple
of years, learning the language and recovering from
his harrowing experiences, he finally managed to
scrape up enough funds and enrolled in the Uni-
versity at Ann Arbor in order to further his con-
stant ambition to better himself.
A few years later, in 1925, he was graduated and
immediately joined the engineering staff of the
Ford-Stout Aircraft Company. From here his climb
to the top was swift and decisive. By 1927, he had
made such a reputation for himself that he was
given the responsible task of designing the equip-
ment and instruments for the University of Mich-
igan's wind tunnel. He also has been Chief Engi-
neer of the Mohawk Aircraft Corporation of Minne-
apolis and the Hamilton Metalcraft Company of
Milwaukee. While with these organizations he
achieved an outstanding reputation as a clever de-
signer by reason of his creation of all the new mod-
els of Hamilton land and sea planes and the Mo-
hawk's latest development, the "Pintos."
Up to this point we see a record that is seldom
equalled in the course of a lifetime by the majority
of men. A record of which any engineer could be
honestly proud. Bear in mind that he accomplished
these tasks in about three years after he graduated
from the University, the period of time most men
take in the transition from college to profession.
And now, only twelve years after landing bank-
rupt and smashed, at the very foot of the ladder to

Practical Surfacing of Roads
The fact that probably many miles of costly
paved roads have been built throughout the United
States where a surface treated gravel road would
have carried the existing traffic satisfactorily at a
fraction of the cost has been suggested by Roger
L. Morrison, Professor of Highway Engineering
and Highway Transport in the University of Mich-
igan.
The total cost of transportation on any high-
way is the cost of the road itself plus the cost of
operating vehicles over it, Professor Morrison
pointed out. Road costs include original con-
struction, interest on invested money, maintenance
and depreciation. Operating costs are those of in-
surance, taxes, garage, depreciation, driver's wages,
and gas, oil, tires, and repairs, these latter varying
with road surface. All these must be considered as
the ultimate cost of transportation to the public.
The total cost of running a car over a smooth
surface road is about one cent less per mile than
on untreated gravel, said Professor Morrison. If
a certain plain gravel road costs, say, $500 a mile
per year to maintain, while a surface treated gravel
costs $1000 per year, then each car driven over the
improved mile saves a cent in operating costs, or
$3.65 per year, and onjy 137 vehicles a day need
pass over the road to make the saving in driving
costs more than the cost of surface maintenance.
As a matter of fact, as many as two to three thou-
sand vehicles may be carried each day over surfaced
gravel without undue wear on the road, if heavy
trucks are few. Such a road returns dividends to
the driving public.
But while surface treatment may be applied to
gravel roads already built, the construction of a
concrete highway calls for building from the bottom
up, and final figures indicate that such a road in-
volves a net annual cost of about $2,400 per year for
each mile. Some experiments have indicated that
the cost of operating a car 011 a pavement is not ma-
terially less than on smooth surfaced gravel, how-
ever, so that in the above case, a minimum of 660
vehicles per day are required to make operating sav-
ings equal the cost of the pavement.
"No one would question the necessity of paved
highways where traffic is heavy, or as main avenues
between important areas, even though traffic may
not average the required number of cars every day
in the year. But there are unquestionably thou-
sands of miles of roads which are relatively minor
arteries which can be served just as adequately
by surfaced gravel as by the more costly concrete,"
stated Professor Morrison.
Sigma Rho Tau
Speaking in terms of statistics, as most people
are in these days, we see one organization in which
there is no depression. That organization is Sigma
Rho Tau.
On November 30, a national convention was held
at which the four chapters, Michigan, Michigan
State, Detroit City College, and Detroit Institute
of Technology, were represented. At this time the
fifth chapter was invited to join, namly the group
from the University of Maine.
The convention group decided to issue a news
letter to keep in touch with the Graduate Members
and to use the question "Resolved: That the im-
mediate completion of the St. Lawrence project
is feasble" for the interschool contests.
A new method of debating called the conference
style is to be used for these contests. It was de-
veloped at the Michigan Chapter and has the fol-
lowing major features: Each side has forty min-
utes; the affirmative must open with a six minute
speech and the negative with a five; the rest of the
time may be divided as seen fit, except that a
speech has a two minute minimum time require-
ment; the teams are composed of five men, and
cross examination is permitted at any time.
In this method we see the practicality of the
engineer again coming to the fore. The style was
designed to be more nearly like the debates of
actual life, in business sessions, legislative assem-
blies, and courts of law. Where it has been tried
it has been found very successful in developing fast

Here's the News—
Dear Alumnus:
During the past month we have received many
news items of interest from far and wide and, know-
ing that you are very anxious to read them, we are
going to cut our remarks short. This time, how-
ever, we intend to sit here at our desk and read
the dispatches that you have sent in rather than
travel around the country and call on you. We
have noticed that items of popular interest in the
newspapers of today appear under the heading,
'News Flashes of the World'. Therefore we think
it suitable to entitle our department this month,
'News Flashes From the Alumni!' We sincerely
hope that you will glean as much interesting infor-
mation from them as we did.
1892
Our first news dispatch comes from sunny Cali-
fornia, where S. F. Dibble, who has retired after
thirty-two years of continuous service with the
General Electric Company, now resides with Mrs.
Dibble at 1616 Sherbourne Drive, Los Angeles.
Our dispatcli states further that Dr. Dibble, di-
rectly after graduation, became an expert with the
Thomson-Houston Co. and after serving with this
company for two years, turned his attention to the
Public Lighting Commission in Detroit, Michigan.
After spending four years with the Commission,
he returned to the General Electric as a supply
salesman in the Chicago office and served the com-
pany continuously until his
retirement on August 1,
1930.
1903
In one jump we span the
country, finding a late news
flash from New York City,
in which we are informed
that Earle K. Knight of that
city is now connected with
the Jobson-Gifford Company
of 441 Lexington Avenue.
He may be reached at 210
Woodland Avenue, New
Rochelle, New York.
1906
We next come across an
item which concerns George L. Harman of Cleve-
land, Ohio. George, it seems, is at present Sales
Manager of the Industrial Brownhoist Corporation
of Cleveland, with whom he has been connected for
the past four years. He resides at 1852 Roxbury
Road, Cleveland, Ohio, with his wife, son and
daughter.
In reading through the Denver Mountain News,
we learn that Justin T. Kingdon of the Treated
Timber Department of the West Coast Lumber-
men's Association may be addressed at 863 Monroe
Street, Denver, Colorado.
Arthur D. Spencer of Detroit, Michigan, is now
employed by the Detroit Edison Company as Con-
troller and Assistant to the General Manager, ac-
cording to a news item in a Detroit newspaper.
1907
In the pile of news dispatches on our desk, we
come across one from Seattle, Washington. Arri-
go M. Young, another Michigan graduate who has
made good, is located at Suite 511, Central Build-
ing, Seattle, Washington, where he is connected
with the firm of Schack and Young, architects and
engineers. Mr. Young assisted in the project of
the Seattle Civic Auditorium, the Arena and the
Recreation Field, as architect of those projects. A
further perusal of the item informs us that he was
married in 1910 to Edith
Thackwell and that his chief
outdoor hobbies are fishing
and tennis.
1908
A brief news item from
Detroit, Michigan, states
that Arthur G. Templin of
5458 Linwood Avenue, De-
troit, Michigan, is now em-
ployed by the Detroit Edi-
son Company as a rate clerk.
1909
The Grand Rapids Press
gives us some information
about Howard E. Baxter of
that city. Mr. Baxter is the
President and General Man-
ager of the Baxter Laun-

fore it was released from boiler pressure. All
samples were guarded with the utmost care from
contamination by the atmosphere. The authors be-
lieve that the values for Ca, obtained by the method
involving precipitation as oxalate and titration with
KMnO4, and the values for CO.,, obtained by an
evolution method rather than the customary titra-
tion methods, are accurate to within 1 p.p.m. Due
to the small concentrations involved, the percentage
error in these determinations is in many cases ap-
preciable. The maximum analytical error in locat-
ing a point for CaCO3 on the logarithmic ordinate of
Fig. 1 should, however, not be more than ±0.15,
while the actual vertical spread reaches a value of 1.
While the possibility of two crystal forms and
uncertainty in analysis, coupled with the probabil-
ity of supersaturation, render it impossible to draw
a single curve representing the solubility of calcite
in complex solutions, it is possible to draw a straight
line through the upper range of the values. Since
this line represents the maximum concentrations
with respect to CaCO3 obtained in the investigation,
the use of values on this line in the calculation of
the SO4—CO., ratio will yield a value of the latter
which is safe, although it may not be the precise
equilibrium value which might be obtained by ex-
tremely refined methods.
The broken line drawn through the lower range
of points for CaCO3 may possibly define approxi-
mately the solubility of the less soluble of the
crystal forms of CaCO3, but the authors do not wish
to stress this suggestion. The solubility curves of
both aragonite and calcite may, however, be reason-
ably assumed to lie within the region bounded by
the solid and the broken line.
At the lowest values of the ionic strength are a
number of high points for CaCO3 which represent
solubility measurements in the closed experimental
boiler used as an autoclave at 150 Ib. pressure. This
was initially charged with solid CaCOs and distilled
water. During the course of the experiment the
value of log ([Ca][CO3]) dropped irregularly to a
value on the solid line and then increased again.
On addition of Na2CO, with corresponding increase
in the ionic strength of the solution, much lower
values were obtained along the broken line. A sec-
ond solubility experiment yielded the sets of paired
values shown which indicate less initial supersatura-
tion than was evident in the first experiment.
A New Value for the SO4—CO:1 Ratio
At 150 Ib. per sq. in. gage pressure the value of
the SO4—CO.; ratio calculated by Hall is 11. Much
higher values are obtained from Fig. 1 by using the
curve for CaSO4 and the solid line through the up-
per range of points for CaCO3. Due to the arbitrary
use of a straight line through the CaCO3 data, the
calculated values of the ratio vary with the ionic
strength. While the exact value of the ratio is in
doubt, the authors feel quite safe in stating that it
is at least 100, and may be appreciably greater.
The conclusion that the SO4—CO3 ratio has a
value greater than 100 is substantiated by the re-
sults from controlled scale-formation tests made in
the experimental boiler. During runs which lasted
12 and 13 days, respectively, the solution fed to the
boiler contained approximately 55 p.p.m. CaSO4
and 55 p.p.m. Na2CO3, or slightly more soda ash
than was theoretically equivalent to the concentra-
tion of Ca. After this water entered the boiler,
CaCO3 was precipitated as sludge, but the reduc-
tion in Ca concentration thus effected was not suf-
ficient to prevent the formation during both runs
of very thin layers of anhydrite scale on the hot
tube, across which heat was being transferred at the
rate of 39,000 B.t.u. per sq. ft. per hr. No attempt
was made during the first two runs to control the
SO4CO3 ratio, which varied during the first run
from slightly above 100 up to 162 and then down to
slightly less than 100, and during the second run
from slightly above 100 to 265 and back down to
179. Since at some time during each of these runs
the boiler water must have been depositing not only
CaCO3 sludge, but also CaSO4 scale, the "equili-
brium" SO4—CO3 ratio must lie somewhere in the
range of values calculated from the boiler-water an-
alyses made during the runs.
During the third run an attempt was made to
hold the SO4—CO3 ratio in the boiler at a value of
100 by varying the amount of soda ash added to the
feedwater, which was a solution of calcium sulphate
containing 48 p.p.m. CaSO4. In spite of the fact
that the ratio value was rather high during the first
six days, the hot tube at the end of the 16-day run
showed practically no calcium sulphate on its sur-
face, the very thin deposit being almost entirely
CaCO3 and iron rust.
The fact that CaCO3 was the solid deposited in
this run, while the thin scales of the other runs were
almost entirely CaSO4, seems definite proof that the
safe value of the SO4—CO3 ratio is above 100. The
authors feel that the next step should be experi-
mental operation of a large boiler under close con-
trol to test the practical effects of maintaining high
ratio values. Any work of this nature will be wast-
ed effort, however, unless the SO4 and CO3 concen-
trations are determined more accurately than has
been the custom in boiler-water control. The au-
thors have elsewhere described the development of
an evolution method for total carbon dioxide with
which very accurate values for CO3 may be ob-
tained, in contrast to the high results indicated by
the phenolphthalein-methyl orange or modified
Winkler titrations. They have also noted the fact

high values for SO4 in a boiler water even though
the instrument indicates correctly with sulphate
solutions containing no other substances.
Significance of the New Ratio Value
The great objection to the use of soda ash as a
chemical for the internal conditioning of boilers has
been the high alkalinity produced in the boiler
water by the hydrolysis of carbonate. The diffi-
culty encountered in maintaining the SO4—CO;,
ratio set by Hall for the prevention of sulphate scale
without overstepping the Na2SO4—alkalinity
ratio recommended for the inhibition of caustic em-
brittlement has led in many cases to the substitu-
tion of various phosphate salts in place of soda ash
as a conditioning chemical. It now seems probable,
however, that the COa concentration required by
Hall's original calculation of the SO4—CO:, ratio
was considerably larger than necessary, and there
is a chance that soda ash may still hold an import-
ant place in boiler-water treatment.
The soda ash added as conditioning chemical to
a feedwater may be thought of as divided into two
portions. The first portion is that amount which is
chemically equivalent to the Ca in the feedwater
and which will be removed from solution in the
boiler by precipitation as solid CaCCX,. The second
portion is the excess of Na^CO,, which is necessary
to maintain a given CO3 concentration and hence a
given SO4—CO3 ratio in the boiler water. It is this
Na._,CO3 which is largely responsible for the de-
velopment of alkalinity, since the precipitated
CaCO3 is quite effectively removed from the scene
of action. Obviously, if it is possible to decrease the
amount of excess Na.jCO, used in a boiler, the alka-
linity produced by hydrolysis will be correspond-
ingly decreased, other factors remaining the same.
Since the rate of hydrolysis of dissolved carbonate
is rather rapid, it is much better practice to add
Na2CO:, continuously at as even a rate as possible
than it is to make large additions intermittently. In
the latter case the concentration of CO., is tempor-
arily raised to a high value, but drops rapidly to a
very low value, resulting in an increase in OH con-
centration with but brief protection as far as
SO4—CO3 ratio is concerned. On the other hand,
when the feed of Na2COs is accurately and con-
tinuously proportioned to the flow of feed-water to
the boiler, the maximum benefit from the standpoint
of scale prevention may be obtained with the min-
imum increase in OH concentration.
The results obtained in the experimental boiler
were quite encouraging. If the OH concentration
in the boiler water is plotted against the CO3 con-
centration, for all of the boiler-water samples taken
during runs D, E, and F, Fig 2 is obtained. A
straight line represents the data within its limits of
accuracy. From this line OH/CO:, = 8.5. That is,
with the experimental boiler operating continuous-
ly at 150 Ib. gage pressure and with an intermittent
blowdown due to sampling of less than 0.5 per cent
of the feed, the boiler water contained on an aver-
age less than 9 p.p.m. OH for each p.p.m CO3. If a
boiler were operated under good control with an
average ratio SO4/CO2 = 100 to prevent sulphate
scale formation, and if, by careful proportioning of
the soda ash used for conditioning, the ratio
OH/COS = 8.5 obtained in the experimental work
were realized, then the embrittlement ratios would
have the values Na2SO4/NaOH = 7.4 and Na2CO3
/NaOH = 0.087. The Na2SO4—NaOH ratio is far
above the value of 2.5, which is believed to be the
upper limit of the embrittlement range.
Looking at it from the other view-point, an
SO4 — CO3 ratio of 100 would allow the develop-
ment of 24 p.p.m. OH in the boiler water for each
p.p.m. CO3 before the edge of the embrittlement
range would be reached.
While these calculations are based upon small-
scale work in an experimental boiler, and thus are
subject to the criticism that plant operation never
does succeed in duplicating laboratory results, the
authors feel that there is no fundamental reason
why any boiler operated at up to 150 Ib. pressure
under competent chemical control cannot be held
in the region of boiler-water composition limited
on the one hand by the maximum SO4 — CO3 ratio
allowable for scale prevention and on the other by
the minimum Na2SO4 — NaOH ratio which is
believed to inhibit embrittlement. To the authors
it even seems possible that boilers might be oper-
ated at higher pressures with soda ash as a condi-
tioning chemical if any considerations made this
desirable. In this connection, the original data
upon which the curves of Larson are based would
be extremely valuable, since from them it should
be possible to calculate rates of hydrolysis.

the interest of the audience.
But to come back to the growth of the organi-
zation, Sigma Rho Tau in the early fall of 1929
was but an embryonic idea in the brain of Profes-
sor Brackett of the Engineering English Depart-
ment.
Soon five men, Haig Iskiyan, Kenneth Koon,
Ray Schmidgall, Thayer Lauer, and Dale Ander-
son began working on the idea and with five other
men, Ed Nell, Fred Arnett, John Hoad, Vernon
Praschan, and Nail Candler formed the "Attic Ten"
or charter membership. This was very late in
1929.

Michigan. He resides at 747 Fountain Street with
his wife and their son and daughter.
1911
A brief news flash from Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
gives us the present address of Alfred C. Schmidt
as 335 North Broadway. Mr. Schmidt is in the
wholesale fruit business.
The Department of Chemical Engineering sup-
plies us with some information concerning Henry
L. Ward. Henry has been connected with the
Western Electric Company since graduation. As
superintendent of the manufacturing engineering
division of the Hawthorne plant, he is concerned
with the development of all chemical and metal-
lurgical processes and equipment.
1913
We are glad to learn the new address of Harold
Williamson and Mrs. Williamson. It is Merton
Road, Detroit, Michigan.
1915
A Washington dispatch informs us that Mr. S.
Shappirio has moved his office to the Washington
Loan and Trust Building, Washington, I). C.,
where he conducts his business as a patent attor-
ney.
1916
A St. Louis news item catches our eye. We
find that Harold Smith, who is Sales Engineer for
the Fairbanks, Morse &amp; Company at 217 South
Eighth Street, is married and may be reached at
128 East Jewel Avenue, Kirkwood, Missouri.
1917
According to the leading newspaper of Eustice,
Florida, David W. Pinkerton, of that fair city, is
employed by Dyer Engineers, Incorporated, as an
industrial engineer. We also learn that David is
married and the father of two children.
1920
Mr. W. G. Harbert, who received his M. S. from
the University in 1921, is employed as a Distributor
for E. F. Houghton &amp; Company, and is in resi-
dence at The University Club, occording to the
latest news dispatch from Akron, Ohio.
1921
We turn again toward the West, to find a news
flash from Omaha, Nebraska, in which we learn
that Mr. Kershaw Harms of that city is employed
by the American Smelting and Refining Company
as Superintendent of the Omaha Lead Refinery
plant.
1922
Detroit, Michigan, seems to be the favorite
"stamping ground" for graduates, since a late news
brief informs us that Mr. William W. Albright,
who resides at 15831 Turner Avenue, is in charge
of the Lubricating Sales Department of the Stand-
ard Oil Company. Along with this item we learn
that Douglas Dow has been recently appointed
Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies of the
city of Detroit. Mr. Dow had previously been con-
nected with the Detroit Edison Company. His
marriage to Mary Louise Murray, daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. Thomas William Murray of Detroit, was
solemnized at New York on December 31st, 1930.
Again we turn to the Department of Chemical
Engineering for information concerning Mr. Ward
H. Pitkin. We are informed that Mr. Pitkin is at
present Sales Manager with the Oliver United Fil-
ters, Incorporated, and in charge of the Chicago
office, 221 LaSalle Street. He may be reached at
Ste. Claire Inn, Ste. Claire, Michigan.
1923
A brief news flash from Philadelphia gives the
residence address of William Alvin Myers as 239
Sedgewood, Springfield. Mr. Myers is employed by
the Atlantic Refining Company of Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania.
1924
Another dispatch from Florida catches our eye.
This time it is from Tampa where Mr. Fred W.
Warner, Jr., who resides at 100 W. Davis Boule-
vard, has the unsual position of distributing lique-
fied petroleum gas for domestic purposes.
1925
At last we have another chance to visit California
as a brief news flash from Los Angeles gives us
the address of Stanley S. LaSha of that city. It
is 760 Bendix Building, where he has offices as
Chief Engineer of the Aeronautical Branch of the
Department of Commerce. Incidently, this is the
first graduate we have noted so far who is in the
aeronautical line.
Back to good old Detroit again, where we find
Axel Anderson married and residing at 15475 Lind-
say Avenue and working in the Engineering De-
partment of the American Blower Corporation.
According to the news item, he had been Manager
of the Tampa, Florida, office until 1927 when he
was transferred to his present position. In the
same paper, we learn that since 1930 Frederick A.
Weihe, Jr., has had offices in Detroit at 6467 Var-
ney Street where he carries on his duties as Man-
ager of the Stark Chemical Industries.
We will stay in the state of Michigan for our
next news flash, but instead of Detroit is it Mid-
land, Michigan, this time. Roy Arthur Plant, of
602 Rodd Street, Midland, is a registered patent
attorney and office manager for the Patent Re-
search Department of the Company. Formerly Mr.
Plant had been with the Dow Chemical Company
of the same city.

concerning Robert W. Seymour. Mr. Seymour is
at present President of the Seymour Manufactur-
ing Corporation, and can be reached at his offices,
7461 South Chicago Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.
Up to 1930, however, Mr. Seymour had been con-
nected with the Acme Steel Company of Chicago
as Assistant Sales Engineer.
1926
Our next news item makes us think of a pro-
gram which comes on the radio every morning at
nine o'clock. It is about James Brayton Deane of
Grand Rapids, Michigan. Mr. Deane is connected
with the Bissell Carpet Sweeper Co. (sponsors of
the Bissell radio hour) of that city and is City
Commissioner of East Grand Rapids.
In looking through our numerous news dis-
patches we come across one which is written in
some strange foreign language. After much in-
quiry among the foreign language professors, we
finally find one who tells us it is Russian and trans-
lates the contents for us. It is from E. Leighton
Knapp, who is in Soviet Russia as a chemical engi-
neer. His address is, Chemical Engineer Cheliab-

headed arrow into the sitter's ribs." The develop-
ment of Colonial art and architecture and the period
of English influence to the days of Gilbert Stuart
and West follow this.
Succeeding chapters are devoted to the early
landscape painters and the subsequent imaginative
creations of Inness and the Romantic School. Ger-
man influences creep into American subject matter
and later into the actual composition and color, un-
til the greater technique and thoroughness of
French painting brings forth the "Cosmopolitans."
Whistler, the philosophical exponent of Form as
opposed to Content, next appears, followed by Ab-
bott Thayer and Sargent, all famous names through-
out the world. Impressionism, and then realism,
the forerunners of the so-called Moderns bring the
list up to the names of Picasso and a host of ab-
stractionists.
In his conclusion, Neuhatts questions the exist-
ence of a characteristically American type of art,
and in realizing the lack of such a thing in the past,
he says, "there are voices, and they are gaining in
strength, which predict for American art a great
future comparable in scope and splendor to the re-
rival of art in Europe during the fifteenth century.
The argument that we are too young is growing less
and less valid with the progress of time. Ameri-
can art will develop its finest flower only if it looks
forward and learns to trust, to follow, its own im-
pulses, its own vision.
The language of its expression, the language of
form and color American art has in common with
Europe and the world at large. It is a language un-
derstood everywhere; it is universal."
The Manly Art of Architecture
(Continued from page 9)
registered by a sigh, or by the arching of an eye-
brow. Like Gilbert's pallid aesthete who walked
down Piccadilly with an orchid or a lily in his me-
diaeval hand.
The art of Architecture hasn't suffered so much
from this eflfeminization as some of the other arts,
for the reason that Architecture has a rather nasty
business side, which cannot fail to win a kind of
respect. There is digging connected with it, and
plumbing, and bricklaying and a vast lot of tire-
some mechanical detail, as well as the stewardship
of considerable sums of money. Labor, sweaty
labor, is involved in it somewhere and architects
have actually been seen at work and at worry.
The universities have dignified its study in a way
they have not quite dignified the study of the other
arts. Men of affairs are obliged to consider it as a
necessity, not as a luxury, and men of affairs prac-
tice it.
Yet it is still a prey to the dangers of senti-
mentality. It is exposed to the poisonous infection
of silly magazine articles, written by romantic
creatures to whom art means affection, to whom
architecture means stage scenery, to whom imi-
tation and reality are of equal importance; if in-
deed they do not prefer imitation. It is a prey to
the confusion of a pretty sketch with the veracity
of a solid structure, to the failure to realize that
the ardors of the imagination are like the labors of
Hercules; that the dreams that come from eating
Hasheesh are quite another matter. It is a prey
to the false conception that there is no intimate
relation between beauty and utility, and to that
other false conception that there is some abstract
ideal of beauty which only the angels, a few up-
holsterers and the true esthetes understand.
As a matter of fact Art is a science like any
other, and, in all the great periods when Art meant
something needful to life, the artist was as virile
as the man at arms, and often far less docile. Stead-
fast in his devotion to high standards of crafts-
manship, no labor was too vast, no patience too in-
finite to achieve his ideal. Bold in his conceptions,
firm in his convictions he went about his work with
gusto giving blow for blow in defense of the in-
tegrity of his beliefs. The good artist was an hon-
est workman forcing his hand to obey the impulse

Indecision, vacillation, weakness were faults of

Eccentricity it must be admitted has sometimes

A weird jargon bas been invented to bewilder and
mystify the naive and what ought to be an honest
work shop is made to appear glamorous under the
term studio.
But your true artist is generally a robust fellow
who stokes up as other men do, who feels the need
of vitamins, and air, and exercise. For if he prac-
tices the art of architecture he has need of every
ounce of physical and mental muscle he can muster
to grapple with the problems forced upon him. He
sketches in the outline of his opus with great sweeps
•of steel; or blocks it out in great masses of masonry.
He not only senses the anatomy of his structures, as
a surgeon knows the anatomy of his subject, but
he creates it. He invents vertebrae and joints, ribs
and tendons. He arranges for heart, and lungs, and
sinuous arteries, and ducts, and glands. Bony struc-
ture, veins, and flesh, and finally skin itself he must
manage somehow; and color he must wield by the
ton, blocks of it, bricks of it, slabs of it from
quarry, or kiln, or mine, or forest.
This is no clilletante's pastime. First, the organ-
ization of the elements into plan and physiognatny,
facades and silhouettes. Next, the nice choice of
the material ingredients, concrete, steel, wood,
stone, glass, marble, metals. The architect's palette
is Gargantuan. All this must be done, not with
nature's profligacy, but, with Nature's economy;
which is perhaps synonomous with Art. Then the
marshalling of an army to erect and make fast, to
join and fit, to hew and carve, to paint and gild.
The army must move with discipline, but the dis-
cipline must be like that of an orchestra, fluent,
plastic, suave and ductile. And, when all is set in
order, every stone, every pin, every dowel must be
accounted for to the master's master, and the mas-
ter's master's mistress; which is a pretty little task
in itself.
Is it any wonder that the Architect takes him-
self seriously as he contemplates the scope and va-
riety of his functions? He practices the most endur-

ENGINEERING WONDERS
During the early stage* of the excavation for tltf penstocks
How du Pont Explosives
helped to build the
LARGEST EARTH DAM
THE WORLD
THE gigantic barrier, built on the Saluda River
near Columbia, South Carolina, is capable of
backing up 750 billion gallons of water for hydro-
electric power. Eleven million cubic yards of earth
were poured into the dam to make this possible.
In building this great dam, the first task was to
construct three miles of railroad to the site. Next
came excavation for the penstocks. Thirty-three
thousand yards of rock had to be removed. Here,
particularly , explosives proved invaluable. Du Pont
Explosives were on the job.
This is but one of hundreds of great engineering
marvels that are made possible through DYNAMITE.
The engineer of tomorrow needs to know all there
is to know about dynamite . . . the tool that helps
to build skyscrapers, bridges, dams, subways,
tunnels, roads and railroads.
How can you know more . . . now . . . while you're
still in college? Write the du Pont Company for
a copy of The Blasters'1 Handbook. This book
contains a wealth of information about explosives
. . . information gathered in one hundred and
twenty-eight years' experience in making and im-
proving explosives. It is compact . . . handy.
It is used in the class-rooms of leading technical
institutions. The Blasters'1 Handbook is awaiting
your request. Write for it.

Like Mercuito, the Architect wears his heart upon

most ubiquitous of all the arts; practically the most
needful as it should be esthetically the most satisfy-
ing. It touches all kinds and conditions of men, af-
fecting- their comfort, their efficiency, their happi-
ness. As in the past, kings and princes have prized
it, and the common people have been sheltered and
inspired by it. So today and especially in America
it is the Art most near to life. And thus it must be
true to life, compounded of the very substance and
spirit of man's best hope. Architecture is an art of
high adventure. It is indeed the manly Art. o
Stability in Floating Bodies

a new position so that it is said to be stable.
As illustrative examples consider the floating
timbers shown.
It is obvious that position II is more stable than
I because in this position (Y-Z) is less. Case IV
is more stable than III and case VI is more stable
than V for the same reason.
There are other methods of approach to these
problems but this energy method has advantages
in some cases. This method is mentioned in
"Statics" by Horace Lamb.
The Law on Partnership
(Continued from page 7)
perintendent handles a sewer job for $4000 plus
15% of the profits, there is not the status of a
partnership. We do not feel that the superintendent
should be held liable for any unpaid bills of the con-
tractor. So again, a salesman of building sup-
plies should not be held as a partner of the ma-
terial man just because he receives wages in the
form of a commission on the profits.
The courts will look to the intent of the parties
as to the use of the terms "profits", "partnership",
etc. But the mere use of the terms is not con-
clusive evidence of the legal relationship.
In studying the relationship between the parties,
it is necessary to keep in mind the subject of
agency. Each partner is treated as an agent of his
fellow partners. His acts will bind them, even as
any agent may bind his principal. In fact, the
Michigan law specifically states that each partner
is an agent for the rest. An interesting case arises
where a partnetr takes a firm's check to the bank
Page Twenty-Eight
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC

then deposits it to his personal account. This sit-
uation arose in Mclntosh vs Detroit Savings Bank,
225 N.W. 628, and it was there held that the hank
was justified in cashing the check, for the partner
was an agent of the firm; but when the cashier saw
the money deposited to the partner's personal ac-
count, he should have been placed on his guard. In
other words, third parties cannot rely absolutely on
the acts of the partners. Incidentally, this rule is
consistent with the general doctrines of agency.
The "estoppel" is a bar raised in law to prevent
a man from asserting or denying a certain true
fact. For instance, if Smith so conducts himself
as to lead Brown into acting to Brown's detriment,
Smith will be estopped to deny certain true facts
in the case. Thus, if Smith is wealthy, and so acts
as to mislead Brown into thinking that he (Smith)
is a partner of the Hot Battery Co., Smith is
estopped to show that he is not in fact a partner of
that firm. This ficticious partnership of Smith and
The Hot Battery Co., is set up purely for Brown's
relief, and is called, "partnership by estopped".
It should be noted, however, that Smith must be
actually charged with misfeasance; nonfeasance
alone is insufficient. Thus in Letscher Electric Co.
vs Stiles, 225 N.W. 513, the defendant tried to

the plaintiff endeavored to establish a "partner-

mitted an advertisement to run in the paper in
which the defendant was referred to as a partner.
It was established that this advertisement was
without the authority of defendant, and that he had
no legal obligation to deny his connection with the
partnership. The court relied on Munton vs Ruth-
erford, 80 N.W 112, a case in 1899 which went much
further. In that case there was an unauthorized
news item in a paper to the effect that defendant
was a partner in the firm, and the court there held

lished in Michigan at least, that the partnership by
estoppel can be set up only when the person to be
estopped has done some overt act to mislead.
Partnership can't be "wished on" an unwilling party
if his conduct has been proper. The detailed Mich-
igan statutes on partnership by estopped are found
in Chapter 191, section 16.
The relationship between the partners them-
selves is usually handled by direct agreement as to
the money and services each shall contribute, and
as to their individual interest, duties and rights on
dissolution. In case the agreement is silent on any
disputed point the Michigan Law provides in Sec.
18, Chapter 191, a definite set of rules, as follows:
a. Partners will be reimbursed for their con-
tributions to the firm, and will share
equally in the profits, losses, and surplus.
b. Each partner will be repaid for the rea-
sonable expenditures he has made for the
firm.
c. Any advances to the firm by a partner is
treated like a loan and not as a purchase
of additional interest in the partnership.
d. Interest under paragraph 'c' shall be
paid from the due date.
e. All partners have equal rights in the man-
agement of the firm.
f. No wages shall be paid any partner for
his services.
g. New members to a partnership must be
agreeable to all.
h. The majority shall rule in management
of the firm, except when this contra-
venes the partnership agreement.
It will be noted that these rules of relationship
are very specific and place all partners on virtually
an equal basis. It is most important, therefore, if
the parties desire to have unbalanced rights and
duties of the partners, that the agreement be specific
as to the contributions of each partner, as to the
duties of each partner, and finally, as to the liabili-
ties of each partner. It should be noted, however,
that while this agreement will determine the rights
of the partners as between themselves, it will place
no limitations on the claims of the creditors against
individual members of the firm.
The Michigan Law goes a long way in prevent-
ing fraud and deceit between the partners. The
entire tone of the statute is that, in the absence of
an agreement to the contrary, the partners shall
stand on an equal footing. The uniform partner-
ship act provides for such specific details as the
keeping of the firm's books in the firm's headquar-
ters, accessible to all members. It provides that
every partner shall disclose on demand of the other
partners all information pertinent to the firm; every
partner must account for partnership profits or
benefits which he has received, and that he is hold-
ing these benefits in trust for the firm.
A court is not prone to meddle into the many
controversies arising between partners. Ordinar-
ily it, will not order a balancing of the accounts,
merely at the whim of a disgruntled partner. How-
ever, this balancing of accounts, "accounting" as it
is called, will be ordered by the court if the com-
plaining partner can show that he has been wrong-
fully excluded from the business activities; or if
the agreement of partnership has been violated; or
if there is a question of some other partner wrong-
fully holding benefits due to the firm; or for any
other reasonable circumstances. This procedure of
calling for an accounting is within the jurisdiction
of equity. However, if it can be shown that there
is a case of fraud, the complaining partner will turn
to law, securing his remedy directly in money dam-
ages.
All partnerships are of comparatively short du-
ration, and when the end of the relationship does
arrive, there are many conflicting business interests
which must be reconciled and protected. For this
reason the subject of partnership is vitally con-
cerned with the time and method of dissolution.
The partnership is a personal relationship; in fact
it is so personal that there is some confusion in the
law whether the doctrines of procedure should be
developed on the "entity" theory or "the group-
ing of the individual members" theory. It would
seem, therefore, that if any partner dies the part-
nership should immediately cease to exist. Such
is the law on the subject, although definite pro-
cedure is provided by statute for the "winding up"
of details. The rules even go a step further than
this, and if a partner becomes financially inca-
pacitated, the partnership ceases. Bankruptcy is
the most common cause of this dissolution. Il-
legal subject-matter of the relationship also will
automatically dissolve the partnership; as where
a liquor firm existing prior to the enactment of the
Eighteenth Amendment does not dissolve of its own
accord before the legal date set for the Amendment
to become effective. A more practical case occurs
where a member of an engineering partnership ac-
cepts an appointment to an office wherein the law
forbids the private practice of engineering.
In Sections 29 to 32, Chapter 191, Compiled Laws
of Michigan, 1929, the causes of the dissolution are
enumerated in detail. If there has been no vio-
lation of the agreement of partnership, the termi-
nation may result because the agreed term has ex-
pired, or by the will of one partner where no defi-
nite term was agreed to, or where the definite term
has not expired but all partners desire termination
and such termination would not jeopardize the
creditors; or finally, where there has been a bona
fide expulsion of a member. Of course, if there has
Page Thirty

can be dissolution.
Because of the personal nature of the relation-
ship, a court will decree a dissolution if one part-
ner is declared a lunatic, incapable of performing;
his duties, guilty of misconduct, or violation of the
agreement. If the business of the partnership can
only be carried on at a loss, then a court may de-
cree a dissolution.
The law goes into considerable detail as to the
preference of creditor's claims and in cases where
partnership assets remain after the debts have been
paid, the law specifies the distribution of such as-
sets between the partners. The substance of the
situation is that the court will direct what is fair
and just under the circumstances. Each partner is
jointly and severally liable for the liabilities of the
firm. No member should so conduct his affairs as
to take undue advantage of his partners or credi-
tors.
The partnership relation represents a very de-
sirable method for a few engineers or architects to
form a business association to conduct their affairs.
They are able in this way to secure the advantages
of the peculiar abilities of the various partners. The
association combines together the individual assets
and reputations of the partners toward a common
end. And finally, each partner is an insurer to cred-
itors of the success of the entire enterprise.

There are other organizations that offer pleasur-
able recreation. The local Y.W.C.A. has an ex-
ceptionally fine building and is heartily supported
by the city's industries. The Schenectady Civic
Players offer the amateur actor an opportunity to
develop his ability. There are groups interested in
everything from music to mountain climbing1. The
lake in Central Park offers skating in the winter
and the hills will satisfy any dare-devil skiier. The
University of Michigan Club of Schenectady is very
active and meets once a month. Last Fall the club
sent a large delegation to the Harvard game in
Boston and this Fall many of its members witnessed
the defeat of Princeton.
If one is unfortunate enough to possess an auto-
mobile, (there is always a friend who has one),
there are innumerable week-end trips that are pos-
sible in the country that is bounded by Montreal to
the North, Boston to the East, New York City to
the South and Philadelphia to the Southwest.
Mountains and lakes are available for hiking, swim-
ming, hunting, and fishing. Beautiful Lake George
is only sixty miles away. Saratoga Lake and Sara-
toga Springs are only an hour's drive and are fa-
mous for swimming, horse racing, and mineral
baths. Albany, the capitol of New York, is only
fourteen miles distant.
A stranger has to grow into "society" with the
passage of years. There is a typical mid-western
cordiality that is distinctly lacking in the East. An
example of this sectional division comes to mind:
Last Fall about a dozen or us were talking late one
night in the Acacia house at Harvard when, for no
definite reason, we decided to take a census. All
of the group were mid-westerners. This sectional
division is not consciously intentional, merely char-
acteristic. This should have no effect upon the
young college graduate as he will find a large num-
ber of other young men quite similar to himself and
with these he will come to constitute a new and
more personal society.
When one leaves college to work in some indus-
try the transition is almost wholly one of labor.
While in college this labor consisted of absorption
of some useful knowledge as to the relationship of
the individual to the group and as to means of bet-
tering the living ways of the group. In the profes-
sion one must continue to absorb as development
progresses but primarily one must produce from
one's previous learning in order that this group de-
velopment may continue. Thus, from the labor as-
pect, one changes from pure absorption to a happy
mixture of absorption and production.
When one leaves college to enter profession
there is no required transition in recreation. Thus,
the new graduate should choose his location so that
his natural hobbies and recreational instincts will be
further developed. If this is not happily done, the
individual will become dissatisfied (rather than un-
satisfied) and certain agencies will naturally bring
about a change of location or of living.
In conclusion it occurs to mind that there is one
service that alumni may easily offer to their univer-
sity. The new graduate may often have personal
questions and individual problems affecting his
choice of professional location. These might be an-
swered and solved by some alumnus of the same
professional education who has been through the
same experiences. For the engineering school it
seems that an alumni bureau might be formed con-
sisting of one interested and sympathetic alumnus
from each of the following engineering depart-
ments: marine, mechanical, electrical, industrial,
aeronautical, chemical and metallurgical. The
writer sincerely offers his personal services and will
be glad to attempt to answer, by private corre-
spondence, any questions addressed to him by sen-
iors or graduates who intend to make metallurgy
their profession.

(Continued from page 23)
Now the Michigan Chapter embraces about one
hundred fifty men who are divided into ten groups
or circles. In fact it has become so large that sev-
eral faculty men have offered their services to help
with the work of the organization. Besides the
parent chapter there are now, as previously men-
tioned, four other chapters.
Such is the phenomenal rise of the "Stump
Speakers' Association," or Sigma Rho Tau, a pure-
ly engineering debating society, in the short space
of two years.
Tau Beta Pi Holds Initiation
Tau Beta Pi, honorary engineering societv,
initiated nineteen seniors and two juniors on
Wednesday, November 11. The ceremony was
held at the Union, and was culminated by a banquet
given immediately afterwards, at which Professor
H. C. Anderson was toastmaster. At this function
the group was addressed by Dean Emeritus Morti-
mer E. Cooley.

SETTLED PAVEMENTS
The principle of operation
of the Mud-Jack is based
upon the well known law
of hydrostatics thaf'pres-
sure is exerted with equal
intensity in all directions".
It is the same principle
which is applied in the op-
eration of hydraulic ele-
vators or pneumatic lifts.
A pressure of 1 Ib. per sq.
in. exerted by the machine
is more than sufficient to
raise the pavement. High-
er pressures are sometimes
necessary first to pry the
slab loose from the sub-
grade.
A SPECIAL combination mixer and pump, the Mud-
Jack, has been developed by National Equipment
Corporation for correcting settlements in rigid
types of pavements. It mixes earth and water, with
sufficient cement to take up the shrinkage, and then
forces the mixture through holes drilled in the slab.
Without detouring traffic, the portable Mud-Jack
brings the slab back to the original grade at a very small
cost. Dips from 1" to 18" deep are corrected with equal
ease—and future settlements can be corrected even more
economically.
The actual operation of the machine begins with a
mixing action in the tank which contains a number of
revolving paddles. A mobile mixture of soil, cement and
water flows into two large cylinders, one at each side of
the machine. Pistons then force the mud from these
cylinders through a 2J/£ inch hose into holes drilled
through the concrete slab.
The Mud-Jack, one of the many products built by
National Equipment Corporation, reflects the continued
progress of N. E. C. in highway machinery and N. E. C.
leadership in engineering development.

1932 Chevrolet sedan
WHEN the skeptical eye of the potential auto-
mobile buyer views the most brilliant array
of cars that the New York National Auto
Show has ever revealed, he will more than marvel
at the achievement in automotive engineering and
design.
Automobile manufacturers have been unusually
active in the past few months in changing -their
models into products of safer and more superior
construction, smoother acceleration and outstand-
ing beauty. Let us briefly review some of the most
important mechanical changes in a few of the cars
for 1932.
Chevrolet
The most important of the new features intro-
duced into the 1932 Chevrolet are the combination
syncro-mesh transmission and an expanding-spring
type of overrunning clutch (free-wheeling). The
unique operation of this syncro-mesh unit enables
an inexperienced driver to shift gears without the
noise of gear clashing.
The free wheeling unit is mounted at the rear of
the transmission and consists of three major parts;
the front driving sleeve attached to the transmission
main shaft; the driving spring; and the rear driving
.sleeve, attached to the propeller shaft. When power
is applied, the driving spring expands tightly into
both sleeves, locking the two together with a force
equal to the power transmitted. When the driving
force is removed (removing the foot from the accel-
erator) the driving spring contracts and the rear
sleeve is free to rotate with the propellor shaft and
rear wheels, while the front sleeve is free to rotate
with the transmission shaft. This is the principle
of Free-Wheeling.
It is primarily added to the syncro-mesh trans-
mission to permit coasting and also to enable the
Chevrolet's front
fender and
radiator brace
operator to shift gears without clashing, especially
when he shifts from high to second speed.
Further improvements in intake valve timing
have been made in the engine, and it now develops
60 horsepower at a speed of 3000 revolutions per
minute. Counterweights have been added to the
crankshaft (counter-balanced crankshaft) to insure
(|iiieter engine operation and longer bearing life.
A complete redesign of the lubrication system
provides positive pressure lubrication to the crank-
shaft main bearings, the cam shaft bearings and the
valve stems. The motor is mounted on rubber in
the frame at four points to give stable mounting
as well as just enough insulation to eliminate noise
and at the same time to permit just enough flexi-
b'lity to assure smoothness.
Another reason for the splendid performance of
the 1932 engine is the new down-draft intake sys-
tem, which has been perfected to eliminate over
choking and provide effective operation for quick
acceleration and economy.
With the absence of the external sun-visor the
genera! appearance of the closed car has a stream-
line effect. The windshield is slanted at a greater
;'.ngle and the sloping front pillars blend gracefully
into the curving top.
The radiator has been improved in both design
and construction. A sheet metal support braces
not only the radiator, but secures the front fenders
rigidly in place.
The transition from 1931 to the car of
1932 is evident in every line and appoint-
ment of the new Chevrolet Fisher Bodies.
In addition to stream-lining, the new
bodies incorporate numerous attractive
interior features.
Seat cushions are larger and deeper,
providing greater comfort and reducing
rebound. The front seat in all closed cars
is adjustable for any reasonable leg room,
by releasing a lever at the left of the seat.
A large cowl venti-
lator, controllable from
the driver's seat is ad:l-
ed to provide ventila-
tion without opening Top view showing the

improved and the top rail of the panel is lower and
has a removable ash tray for the convenience of
the front seat occupants. All instruments on the
dash panel are modernly designed to enable the
driver to see their resulting actions at a quick glance.
The wood structure of the body is heavier and
stronger with forged steel braces at points of maxi-
mum stress. All doors are somewhat larger and
they are held more rigidly and evenly in suspension
by two hinges instead of three.
The open models present a more pleasing appear-
ance. The roadster top has a decidedly custom-
built appearance and it has a chromium plated
moulding at its front edge. The top folds into and
unusually compact space and it is covered by an
attractive, close-fitting snap-on cover which elimi-
nates the usual boot.
The new 1932 Chevrolet which now comes in
twenty different body styles is truly a modern dis-
tinctive creation for the low priced line of auto-
mobiles.
Hupmobile
The Hupmobile eight in line has been trans-
formed into a new radical design that presents a
striking appearance, but it somehow maintains
Hupmobile form or individuality. The six, though
not as radical in design as the eight, incorporates
many of the new mechanical features found in the
eight.
Distinctive changes in the radiator design gives
the appearance of massiveness. The exclusive de-
sign in form-fitting fenders adds to the modern
f-tyling of the body and reduces air resistance. A
new type of steel running boards which are corru-
gated for stiffness and greater strength, braces both
front fenders.
A newly designed double-drop X-frame provides
not only greater strength and rigidity but it also
accounts for the low height of the car (5 ft. 6 in.).
However, comfort is not sacrificed for lowness and
ample space is provided for head room.
The patented chassis torsional stabilizer is of
particular mechanical importance in that it elimi-

i:ated shimmy, road weave, and general instability
at high speeds. This triangular structure is made
of steel tubing and angle iron bracing and it con-
nects and supports, the radiator, and the dash to
the frame.
The free-wheeling unit has been improved and
it is now more easily operated by the push-pull
dash control. Another feature of this unit is the
automatic throw-out and re-engagement when re-
versing the car in free-wheeling. But free-wheeling
ij automatically reengaged when starting forward
if still in free-wheeling.
Kngine performance has been improved to pro-
vide greater flexibility, getaway, and smoother op-
eration. In the eight cylinder engines the piston dis-
placements of the series 222 and 226 respectively
are 250.7 and 279 cubic inches. The six develops 75
horsepower at 3200 revolutions per minute.
Due to the extensive use of rubber in engine
mounting and insulation, motor vibrations are re-
duced to a minimum. This feature of rubber
mounting is also found in the rear of the transmis-
sion. The 110 horsepower new eights feature in-
creased breaking power. The drum size of the hy-
draulic brakes has been enlarged to give this posi-
tive control.
In conjuction with these new mechanical features
the improved steel body framework and superior
body construction add a great deal to the finer rid-
ing qualities in this new modern car of the medium
to higher price class.
Rockne
Notre Dame's famous coach has been honored by
Studebaker. It has named its latest creation in the
automotive line for him. This car makes its first
formal appearance at the National Automobile
Show. It is being introduced in two lines: The
"65" and "75" with 65 and 72 horsepower respect-
ively.
The fundamental principle of the Rockne Six is
the introduction of a medium size car of outstand-
ing features into the lower price field.

The Rockne
"75" Sedan
"65" Coupe
The body lines represent beautiful aerodynamic
styling and the bodies are scientifically moulded
from front fender to the tail light to reduce wind re-
sistance and increase speed. The radiator is sloping
and is artistically outlined with chromium. Both the
gasoline tank and radiator cap are concealed.
The "75" engine has a piston displacement of
205.3 cubic inches and develops 72 horsepower at
3200 revolutions per minute. Connecting rods are
drop-forged from selected steel while the heavy
drop-forged crankshaft is statically and dynamical-
ly balanced with four counterweights. A full pres-
sure oiling system provides positive lubrication.
Other features incorporated in this new six are:
selective free-wheeling with syncro-mesh transmis-
sion, automatic switch key starter, double "X"
frame, and improved methods in the motor cooling
system.
This snappy, low-priced model of such superior
quality will surely be a fitting tribute to the man
whose name it bears.
Dodge
Xew Dodges of the eight and six cylinder types
are also presenting many changes and vast improve-
ments. Their outstanding mechanical additions
and changes are: automatic clutch-control, floating
power, free-wheeling, silent-gear selector, double-
drop bridge-type frame, vilite squeak-proof springs,
silent second gear, mono-piece steel body, and im-
proved hydraulic braking power.
The automatic clutch is vacuum operated through
a control valve attached to the intake manifold and
governed by the movement of the accelerator pedal.
The instant the accelerator pedal is released the
clutch disengages ahead of the transmission and the
free-wheeling unit functions at the rear of the trans-
mission. This automatic operation makes the trans-
mission completely dead and inert. With this
unique control, gear selecting can go on at any
speed.
The recent engineering development of floating
power which has been introduced in the new Ply-
mouth has been adapted in the Dodge line. This
new feature not only provides unusual comfort, but
it eliminates rigid engine mountings.
The double-drop bridge-type frame is the result
of automotive research in determining the strongest
type frame suitable to resist several times more
than the unusual strains in driving.
Mono-piece steel body construction remains para-
mount in the Dodge line and its construction, co-
ordinated with the double-drop frame type, pro-
duces lower centers of gravity and increased head
room.
There has been no fundamental change in engine
design or construction except for the floating power
method of mounting in the frame. Brake horse-
power however has been increased to 90 at 3400
revolutions per minute with the enlargement of the
bore from 3 inches to 3J4 inches. Pistons are of
light aluminum alloy and pins of the floating type
of chrome-nickel alloy steel. The spark advance is
fully automatic, and spark plugs are metric type
with heavy electrodes.
The general appearance of the new Dodge is
much like that of the 1931 model, however, the hood
is longer and more graceful. The fenders are longer
and more sweeping and with the perfect blending
of the cowl into the sloping visorless windshield, an
attractive stream-lined appearance is effected.
The Graham "Blue Streak" Eight
The Graham "Blue Streak" eight truly is an ultra
modern car because of its radical body design and
unusual appearance and construction. The treat-
ment of line and contour has been employed grace-
fully and sweepingly from the front fenders and rad-
iators to the tips of the rear fenders. The unique
design of the fenders and running boards conceals
the chassis and running gear.
The introduction of a new banjo type frame with
the rear axle extending through (instead of under)
the straight side rails is an important mechanical
feature. This modern type frame permits lower and
better spring suspension that gives the car its ex-
treme low center of gravity. Maximum stiffness
throughout the rear of the frame is maintained and
"kick-up" in the frame rail over the rear axle is
eliminated.
Other mechanical improvements are Synchro-
Silent transmission with the free-wheeling unit, su-
per-hydraulic brakes with contrifuse drums, dash
regulated shock absorbers, dual valve springs and
the new cool-gas fuel system.

THE LAW ON SALES
By Prof. WALTER C. SADLER
The
Lawyer's
Club
IN THE old clays of "infant commerce", the aver-
age domestic sale was made on a cash basis.
Even in the case of foreign trade the English
merchant expected the Master of his ship to make
cash transactions in Lisbon, at the Mediterranean
Ports, or in the Orient. The "Law Merchant" and
the other groups of common law rules on sales and
negotiable instruments show that transactions were
essentially on a cash basis in these early days of
British Commerce as contrasted to our modern idea
of credit purchases.
Commerce Through Credit
Modern commerce has brought about a crystalli-
zation of the law on credit sales, making it some-
what similar to the fundamental doctrines of the old
common law, but primarily designed to take care
«f an entirely new situation. The "pay as you use"
doctrine extends from the home to the center of in-
dustrial activities. The radio is purchased for a
$25.00 down payment with the balance in $10.00
monthly payments, while the big contractor buys
his steam shovel on the same basis. The far reach-
ing effects of these modern developments are inter-
esting. This present article is not concerned with
the resulting tendency towards a false standard of
living, with the risk of all living beyond their means.
Rather it is concerned with the legal rights and
remedies which flow from this new relationship; a
relationship new in the sense of its extensive utiliza-
tion in our modern form of living. Some of the spe-
cific problems which may develop are as follows:
1. The radio is destroyed during the process
of payment and the buyer refuses to continue
payment.
2. The buyer defaults on payments and the
sheriff retakes the instrument for the seller.
3. The contractor becomes bankrupt before
the steam shovel is paid for, and the seller trys
to keep the shovel out of the control of the re-
ceiver.
4. The shipment of goods on approval, or
option, which is lost in transit; and again the
modern law must determine who is the loser.
The Title Transfer
The real problem in sales is one of title. Who has
the right of exclusive ownership of the goods? If
the seller has no title to the goods he cannot trans-
fer a good title to the innocent purchaser. This is
the foundation of the rule that a good faith buyer
of stolen goods receives nothing. If the seller has
good title to the merchandise, it is not necessary
that either the goods or the consideration pass at
the time of sale. Thus. Baxter signed a memoran-
dum of sale that he had that day sold hay to Tarl-
ing, delivery after payment. Before either deliv-
ery or payment, fire destroyed the hay, and the court
there held that the parties clearly intended an im-
mediate sale, and the right of oumcrship to pass at
once, but right of possession to remain in the seller as
a security for the payment. The buyer was there-
fore the loser. The intent was that he should have
immediate title to the hay.
The Goods Must Be Ascertained
Another requirement of a sale is that the goods
be definite and ascertained. It is common sense that
when parties are negotiating for the sale of goods,
the exact goods be known with certainty. Thus, if
Smith agrees to buy 150 pieces of 12" x 12" x 20'
timbers from a yard containing 1000 such sticks of
timber, and a fire destroys 500 sticks before delivery
is started to Smith, can one say whether the partic-
ular sticks sold to Smith were burned or not?
If the timber is clearly ascertained, the buyer would
be the loser. Thus the seller might stamp, "Sold"
on each of the 150 sticks, or more commonly, he
might remove the 150 sticks to a different place in
the yard. The records are full of cases dealing with
technical variations of this general problem.
Fungible Goods as an Exception
Fungible goods are those items of personal prop-
erty which may be interchanged and which cannot
be distinguished, one quantity from another. Oil,
wine, and grains are fungible goods, and it is com-

Economic Conditions
When it is necessary to cut down the costs of
production in the business world, the wages of the
employees are the first to suffer. Very often the
salaries of the executives are not effectd by this
measure. Such is the case that exists here, at
Michigan. The salary of the faculty men has not
been diminished in any way during this period of
business stagnation. We do not object to this for
we realize that most of the men are underpaid
when a comparison is made with men in the com-
mercial world. Yet we do think that in some small
measure, they should help the conditions that ex-
ists among the students in the matter of part-time
employment.
A great number of the students are living very
poorly and so poorly that they are endangering
their health by doing so. It has been reported
that some students are living on as little as $2.00
a week for food. This situation might be aided a
little if some of the men on the faculty would
employ a student to do some of the many small
tasks around their homes. It would mean very
little to the employer and a great deal to the stu-
dent. The Committee for Unemployment that was
appointed by the people of Ann Arbor to take care
of families within the city has received many of the
jobs that were formerly open to students.
We ask that the faculty bear this little mes-
sags in mind when they go down to take care of
the furnace or do any other task they do not
really care about doing.
What About It
When Wall Street represented a Canyon of Gold
and our economic condition was a healthy one,
business men employed psychologists to study the
working conditions in their offices. Responsive
colors and many similar ideas were incorporated
into the working rooms. A pleasant atmosphere
was created. Then one day the Bears entered one
end of Wall Street and the Lambs left by the
other and psychologists were forgotten.
Today we might all employ a little phychology
that will make things easier. For instance when we
use the word Depression, everybody immediately
becomes discouraged. They lament their fate and
GARDNER S. WILLIAMS
the conversation runs like this:—"Just look at poor
Mr. Smith, lost everything!" Now in talking with
our friends if we were to say, "this period of busi-
ness stagnation" or "this static condition of busi-
ness," everyone would react differently. It does
carry a little brighter tone n'ect-ce pas? Try it on
your friends and see how they respond to it.
Gardner S. Williams
On December 12, 1931, another great Michigan
engineer passed to the land beyond. The death of
Mr. Gardner S. Williams, '8gR, is deeply mourned
by his former students and his many friends
throughout the country.
Mr. Williams devoted most of his life to the de-
velopment of Hydraulic Engineering. It is in this
capacity that he has become known to many people.
In 1905 he was appointed Professor of Civil, Hy-
draulic, and Sanitary Engineering at the University
of Michigan, which office he held until the summer
of 1911. From this time until his death he was en-
gaged in consulting work in his chosen field.
His publications have been numerous and of
great value to his profession. His writings have
been chiefly to papers published under the author-
ity of the societies to which he belonged. He also
published a few scientific books on Hydraulics.
Thomas J. Kneebone
The death of Thomas J. Kneebone, instructor in
shop practice, on Jan. 18, 1932, leaves a vacancy in
that department that will be very hard, if not im-
possible, to fill. True, there are many men who
can take his place, but few who will be able to fill
it.
The students who worked under him will re-
member him as a man who was always cheerful
and who, rather than to rebuke a student, would
kindly show him his error and invariably help to
correct that error.
This is the real type of instructor and teacher.
and so it is with the deepest regret that we hear of
Mr. Kneebone's passing.

ROBERT S. DAVIS
BOB DAVIS
HERE is a radical of the first water for pre-
presentation to our readers, the redoubtable
Bob Davis, for Bob has a quarrel to pick
with the engineering school curriculum in general,
and that of the Civil department in particular. Tsk!
Tsk! His platform for reform would involve the
abolition of all technical courses, with the substitu-
tion in their place of four years work in speech.
This is not to be interpreted that Bob is not a re-
spectable student, but insinuates, instead, the nature
of his pet avocation,—throwing the bull.
Bob has not fussed around with activities overly
much, but a mildish interest has brought him a per-
ennial committee job in the class, election to Tri-
angles and this year's presidency of Vulcans. He
also went out for basketball his sophomore year,
but a difference of opinion with the mentor led him
to dismiss the idea of trying to make the team, and
he has since contented himself with playing with in-
tramural aggregations.
This year Bob has been working with Dean Burs-
ley's freshmen luncheon group as an upperclass ad-
visor, and doubtless many a frosh has been led
through the mazes of the first year on campus with
the help of the genial Davis. He is also treasurer
of the student branch of the A.S.C.E.
Bob hails from Kalamazoo, but that is nothing
to be held against him. An interesting character to
chat with, and a highly popular all-round good fel-
low. Bob has about all the social prerequisites. He
is a member of Sigma Phi fraternity, and is serving
as house manager for the organization this year.
JACK SPENCER
ONCE upon a time, back in 1928, a young lad
from Orchard Park, New York, presented
his credentials to the powers that be in the
University, and since nothing could be found amiss
with them, the said young lad paid his tuition and
has since been circulating around under the name
SPOTLIGHT
of Jack Spencer. The name Orchard Park, it is to
be admitted, does sound rather fruity (ha! ha!),
but apparently has no effect on its inhabitants, in-
so far as our specimen of virile manhood is a rep-
resentative citizen.
In his role of the Technic's Man of Mystery, and the
cardinal point in the riddle, "Where the devil is
Spencer?", Jack is one of the most sought-after men
in the college. But other than being possessed by a
mania for never being on deck when someone is
trying to locate him, Jack seems to be a very rea-
sonable and likeable sort. In fact, in the light of
those who must always be in the way, it is quite
soothing to meditate on Jack's ways and means of
making himself inaccessible, annoying though it is
at times.
Starting out at a tender age. Jack's rise in the
field of publications work reads like a Horatio Al-
ger, Jr., epic, and it might be a suggestion of merit
for him to publish his memoirs under the title of
"From Office Boy to Business Manager". In climb-
ing the rungs of the ladder of success, he paused for
a year to serve in the capacity of sales manager, and
now that he reigns supreme in his half of the Tccluiic,
Jack can throw around enough figures on the effect
of the depression and the number of stamps used
in the office to make most anybody cower.
But not being content with
this outlet for his energies.
Jack played politics and last
year was elected a member of
the J-Hop committee. He also
served on the two Slide Rule
Dances that have been given
in recent years, and in his
capacity of tickets chairman
last year was one of the main
factors in the success of the
affair.
Jack is also a member of the
student branch of the A.S.
M.E., Triangles and Vulcans.
His fraternity is Phi Gamma
Delta, which makes him a
"brother" of Calvin Coolidge,
in case no one knows it.

OUR ALUMNI
FRED W. SEYMOUR
EVERY once in a while there are to be found
men who rise beyond the distinction of being
merely blessed with a pleasant personality
and of being generally well-liked,—whose contacts
with others induces a stronger reaction than a feel-
ing of respect and approbation. We all have our
friends and acquaintances, but not so many of us
can command the enthusiasm and loyalty that are
reserved for the few, and in this latter group we
would like to place Russell A. Dodge, assistant
professor of engineering mechanics.
Thinking of writing this sketch we asked a
group of students, "Who knows anything about
Dodge?" Three or four voices promptly yelled,
"He's all right", with such nice co-ordination that
we were almost prepared to believe in mental
telepathy. Certainly it is no affront to anyone to
say that he is immensely popular with his stu-
dents, and this may be partially explained by his
brief statement that after a few original misgiv-
ings he now enjoys teaching thoroughly, especial-
ly with a good student as material. His time he
gives freely, almost unreasonably so, to students
in difficulty, a common enough practice, but demon-
strative of his desire to get his material across
and help his men the best he can.
Mr. Dodge is the next best
thing to a "local product."
Horn not so many miles from
Ann Arbor, at Whitemore
Lake, he attended grammar
school at the latter place and
then graduated from Ann Ar-
bor High School. He then
entered the University and
graduated with the degree of
B.S. in Civil Engineering in
1916, to stay on another two
year doing graduate work in
hydraulics.
A military career then beck-
oned, temporarily at least, and

PROF. RUSSEL A. DODGE
THE dramatic unfolding of a brief but brilliant
career always seems to excite the reader to
an absorbed interest in following through
to the finish. The popularity of well written bio-
graphical literature can be offered as the most
conclusive evidence in support of this statement.
However, the fact that it makes interesting read-
ing is probably the least important thing concern-
ing the story of a great man's rise. The highest
value is to be derived from the lessons learned and
the experience to be gained from a tale of accom-
plishment. And it is with this two fold view in
mind, to provide interesting reading and to set
forth an inspiring account, that this review of an
eminently successful engineer's life is included here.
Frey W. Seymour has won an outstanding place
for himself among the foremost utility executives
of the nation by reason of his remarkable ability
at organization and management. He stands now,
practically alone, at the head of the American power
world. Besides his several minor connections with
smaller units, he now holds the position of Pres-
ident of the American Gas and Power Company,
and that of Vice-President and General Manager of
the American Commonwealths Power Corporation,
two of the greatest public utilities organizations in
the world. He is affiliated with organizations
throughout the United States and Canada, the
aggregate capital of which reaches a figure esti-
mated at three hundred millions of dollars. He is
truly a dynamic personality heading a dynamic
industry; how did he rise so phenomenally?
His first schooling of importance was gained in
preparation for college at St. Johns Military Acad-
emy up in the woods of Wisconsin. His next move
was to Ann Arbor where he spent four very fruit-
ful years attending the College of Engineering at
the University of Michigan. After graduating in
nineteen hundred and nine he accepted a position
as chemist with a Texas cement firm. By nine-
teen fourteen his abilities had become so apparent
that he was enticed back to Michigan and made-
chemist and Plant Superintendent at the Grand
Rapids Gas Company. Two years of hard work

HERE'S THE NEWS-
Dear Alumnus:
Let us all drop in on the Technic office this
morning and take care of our little daily visit.
Who knows hut what there may be something in-
teresting going on—it's getting along towards
time for the new issue to come out and activity
should certainly be rampant. Well here we are;
everything seems to be coming along smoothly
enough, doesn't it? No one appears to be work-
ing too hard or too little—the clatter of typewriters
and the incessant murmur of proof-readers goes on
in unbroken continuity. But wait, an interruption;
here comes the postman with the magic keys to
the mailbox radio over in the far corner. The
Alumni broadcast is coming in—we had better get
busy here and start taking down the news to pass
it on in these columns. Here they come:—
1897
Our first wave length is that of the Owensburg
Clay Products Company of Owensburg, Kentucky.
We are greeted with the news that Henry S. Barton
is now President of that Corporation as well as
being Vice-President of the Glenmore Distilleries.
After leaving the University, Mr. Barton studied
law in Washington, D. C., and was admitted to the
Kentucky bar in 1900.
1898
Here's a radiogram from Chicago about one of
t!-e best known civil engineers in the country.
Murray Blanchard, who is
now giving his complete
attention to his practice as
a consulting engineer with
offices in Chicago at 200
Engineering Building, 205
\Vest Wracker Drive. Mr.
Blanchard has had a very
interesting and varied ex-
perience—we certainly have
enjoyed his broadcast, tell-
ing about the many projects
he has been connected with.
1902
Well, more music from
Chicago. Charon W. Brooks,
who is handling this broad-
cast, is no w Secretary-
Treasurer of the Brooks and Stewart Company. En-
gineers and Contractors, 1020 Monadnok Building,
specializing in the design and construction of indus-
trial plants and mining structures. He starts out
by telling of Arthur M. Barrett, who is president
of the Barrett Bindery Company, 1328 \V. Monroe
Street, and who lives out in Winetka, 111., at 510
Cherry Street. "Tall Timber" as he calls him, has
many other interests besides the bindery, including
a family of two boys and two girls.
And now we hear his remarks about John L.
Dickey, Vice-President of the Lester F. Alexander
Co., General Contractors, 803 Audabon Building.
New Orleans, La. He is also President of the
Crescent Realty Company, dealing in Gulf Coast
real estate. "Tub" resides at 1436 Carrolton Ave-
nue in New Orleans and has a family of two daugh-
ters. Mr. Brooks says he hasn't changed greatly
and still carries his 330 pounds with considerable
ease.
He drops a few more words before signing off.
William-N. Udell is now in Chicago designing some
special ice machinery. He has recently made a
trip around the world in the interest of develop-
ments of artificial ice plants.
1903
And the last of Mr. Brooks welcome broadcast.
Peter M. Lowerse is now
Chicago manager for the
Truscon Steel Company. He
has recently become a dot-
ing grandfather and lives in
Arlington Heights, Illinois.
1905
Sterling, Illinois, is com-
ing in fine this afternoon.
\Ve hear that William A.
Robinson, President of the
Charter Gas Engine Com-
pany of that city has recent-
ly been elected President of
the School Board and is very
active in several other
branches of civic life there.
He lives at 1108 \Vest Third
Street.

lencer.
Though the sedan stands only five feet nine
inches high, the wheel base has been lengthened to
123 inches and the interior of the body offers added
comfort and space.
Packard
The introduction of a completely new car, the
Packard Light Eight was announced Jan. 9, 1932.
At the same time it was made known that the Pack-
ard Twin Six has been reestablished as the leader of
the Packard line of automobiles.
These two new cars now give four complete lines,
with 41 body models, in addition to the individual
custom cars.
FLOATING FOVIER
The Twin Six, which revives memories of one of
the country's best known motor cars, of fifteen years
ago, enters that exclusive and limited production
field where the last word in motoring luxury is
demanded and where prices are correspondingly
higher.
At the same time the company is continuing with
the eight-in-line engine. The motor in the light

dard Eight and the DeLuxe Eight. In both of these
eight is of the straight eight type, with still further

latter cars have been incorporated other outstand-
ing improvements found in the two new cars. All
have a new silent syncro-mesh transmission in
which all three forward speeds are quiet.
The Light Eight, a big car with a wheelbase
of 128 inches, shows a striking new radiator and
sweeping stream-line curves throughout. Its radia-
tor retains the characteristic Packard lines but nar-
rows down and sweeps forward at the bottom in
a long graceful curve to merge into the front
fenders. The stream-line effect is brought about
by a deeply recessed radiator, and long curved bars
which extend from top to bottom of the shell form-
ing a Vee, as well as a rod extending through the
shell from fender to fender on which are mounted
the headlights. An unbroken sweep is thus given
to the frontal appearance, while at the same time
the cross tie between the front fenders—to which
Dodge "X" frame and chassis
the shell is fastened—gives the characteristic front
stability.
The fenders, made in one piece with the front
dust pan and the hood ledges, act as a screen for the
front of the frame, the forward springs, axle and
other chassis parts, as well as to carry out the
stream-line appearance.
The frame is of an entirely new design. It has a
double drop with 8-inch side rails and a big box
girder X member in the center. The after legs of
this X member extend to a point near which the
forward ends of the rear springs are anchored and
the front legs meet the frame at a point near where
the after engine supports are fastened. At the front
is a K shaped member which ties the front ends
of the frame side rails in a rigid manner. The en-
gine is mounted in the frame at four points through
rubber mountings.
Graham "Blue Streak" Eight sedan
The rear axle also offers something new in design.
It has the appearance of having been turned upside
down, with the forward side inclined upward. The
pinion gear drive of the hypoid gears is located
below the center in this manner, much the same as
a worm drive. Much of the reduction in height is
obtained in this manner as greater clearance is given
above the axle.
Through the "ride control" device, shock absorb-
ers can be instantly adjusted to meet all driving,
tiding and weather conditions. It is operated by
a push pull knob, conveniently located near the
steering column. Bodies of all the Packard cars
are insulated against heat, cold and noise. Springs
are covered with a flexible metal covering and are
permanently lubricated, insurance against spring
squeak.
Engines now run from 110 horsepower in the
Light Eight to more than 150 horsepower in the
Twin Six. The DeLuxe Eight motor now develops
135 horsepower and the lighter Standard Eight de-
velops in excess of 110 horsepower.
In appearance the Twin Six car is much the same
as the DeLuxe Eight. The hood has the same long
slim lines, made possible by the unusual design of
the engine which holds it to an overall width hardly

radiator is somewhat different, with a more pro-
nounced Vee, vertical sides, and a narrow strip of
the radiator shell extending down the apex of the
Graham's banjo type rear axle assembly
Vee which is painted as is the rest of the radiator.
All of the accessories have been taken from the
sides of the engine where they are usually found
and grouped at the front end to give maximum
accessibility and clearance at the sides.
The upper half of the crank case and both cylin-
der blocks of the Twin Six engine are cast integral.
The cylinders are set at an angle of 67 degrees and
are of the L head type. It is almost a square

Faculty Members' Works Translated
into French and Japanese
Word has been received from John Wiley and
Sons, publishers, that two of the books written by
Professor T. R. Running of the Engineering Col-
lege Faculty, have been translated into Japanese.
The works are "Empirical Formulas" and "Graphi-
cal Mathematics". The transmitting was done in
[930 by T. Katsurai, who is a Professor of Physical
Research in Tokio. At present Professor Katsurai
is in Upsala, Sweden, working on "Raman" effects
of the complex salts. He expects to return to Tokio
in the near future to resume his duties there.
''Empirical Formulas" has also been translated
into French. The translating was done in 1931 by
Captain Sallen, who is a captain in the French
Army.

that June he enlisted in the army with the humble
rank of private. The week that the war ended,
however, he received his commission.
He next accepted a position in January, 1919,
with the United States Bureau of Reclamation and
did work along the Rio Grande until the end of the
year, when he came back to do hydraulic work with
the Consumers Power Co., at Jackson. This posi-
tion he in turn resigned to return to Ann Arbor to
work with Cooley, Riggs and Anderson on an ap-
praisal of the Consumers Power.
With his work in that connection terminating
in August, 1921, he again made contact with the
University and commenced teaching as an in-
structor that fall. Promotion to his present rank of
assistant professor came in 1925.
Mr. Dodge is a member of Sigma Xi, and alum-
nus advisor to his fraternity. Tau Kappa Epsilon.
He also belongs to the American Society of Civil
Engineers and the Michigan Engineering Society,
besides being active in fraternal organizations such
as the Kiwanis Club and the Masonic bodies of
Ann Arbor. He has been on the Board of Direc-
tors of the Ann Arbor Y.M.C.A. and the Chamber
of Commerce, and to further prove his civic-mind-
edness, he has served as an officer with the local
Community Fund organization.
At the present time Mr. Dodge is working on
the problem of surge effects in open channels, un-
der the direction of Professor H. W. King. When
the weather is obliging, however, he enjoys putter-
ing around his rock garden at home, and he never
tires of playing Dad to his youngsters.

brought him his big chance to make good and, in
nineteen sixteen, he became Vice-president and
General Manager of the Battle Creek Gas Company
at Battle Creek, Michigan.
Mr. Seymour's next important project was the
organization, in nineteen twenty-two, of Federated
Utilities Incorporated, of which he was President
until he sold out his interests in nineteen twenty-
seven in order to devote his energies to the build-
ing up of the National Gas and Electric Company.
He founded this latter corporation in nineteen
twenty-seven and nourished it into such great
strength that it was finally absorbed by the Amer-
ican Commonwealths Power Company. He now
became associated with this great corporation as
Vice-president and Consulting Engineer and has
steadily climbed up to the position he now holds
in this well known firm.
His life has been characterized throughout by
the very highest development of engineering and
organizing ability as well as an exceptional under-
standing of human nature which has endowed him
with such unusual attributes of success in his sev-
eral relations with the general public. His sterling
qualities have made him loved and honored wher-
ever he has become known. He has been con-
gratulated by engineers the world over for his ac-
complishments. We hasten to add ours and hope
that continued greatness and the highest degree of
success may follow the enterprises of a great en-
gineer.

The Law on Sales

mon knowledge that one barrel of oil of a certain
specification is absolutely interchangeable with any
other barrel of the same specification.
The application to fungible goods of the rule that,
"goods must be ascertained" may lead to undesir-
able results. Thus, Green, a miller, agrees to pur-
chase 1000 bushels of wheat from the seller's ware-
house No. 7 in Montana. Both parties desire to
make an immediate sale, but the "ascertained" rule
requires that the specific 1000 bushels be identified

have become an exception to this rule, and title may
pass immediately without the goods being identi-
fied and moved out by themselves. This exception
is purely an expediency developed by the law to
meet the demands of commerce.
Unfinished Goods
Unfinished goods receive a similar legal treat-
ment. If farmer Smith inspects a farm wagon dur-
ing its construction, and agrees to buy it upon com-
pletion, the law presumes that the title does not
pass at once. That is, the burden of proof that the
title has passed lies with the party asserting the
same. This is a reasonable rule, for the buyer may
not be satisfied with the product when it is finished.
If the seller were unscrupulous he might use infer-
ior materials in completing the article, or he might
unduly hasten the workmanship. In other words,
the buyer has not seen the article exactly as it will
be when finished, and it is presumed that he would
not want definitely to agree to purchase the article
until he can see it in its finished form.
Of course the buyer may be liable in damages for
whatever expense the seller has been put to through
the buyer's special instructions in completing the
article, if it develops after completion that there has
been no sale.

ever, and the buyer is at full liberty to assume the
risk of the nature of completion of the article. That
is, the parties may pass title before completion by
merely demonstrating a clear intention so to do.
If farmer Smith in the previous case desired to
take the wagon just as it stood, completing it him-
self, title could pass at once. As far as that sale
is concerned, the article would be complete.
There are a number of borderline cases where it
is not clear w'hether the article is complete at the
time the agreement is entered into. A troublesome
situation develops where the agreement requires
weighing the mass of goods before delivery. At
first the cases appear to be in conflict, some holding
that if the goods are to be weighed, they are not
in a deliverable state, while others hold contra. It
would seem more desirable, however, to analyze the
decisions on the basis of the probable intent of the
parties. If the buyer is the one to do the weighing
it would appear that the parties intended title to
pass at once. This is consistent with the view that
the article is apportioned, with the whole power in
the buyer. There is nothing which the original
owner, the seller, can do to expedite the passage of
title. On the other hand, if the seller is the one
to weigh the goods, he has not completed his part
of the work. As far as the seller is concerned, there
is still something remaining to be done before the
contract is complete. The intention of the parties in
each case is the most logical test as to whether title
has passed.
Sales on Approval or at Option of Buyer
Goods are frequently sold on approval. For in-
stance, the Everwear Carpet Company sends a car-
pet to the purchaser to be placed in his home for a
three day trial. The agreement specifies that if the
purchaser is satisfied with the carpet, he may pay
within thirty days, otherwise the carpet is to be re-
turned by freight, collect. In this case there is a
definite condition of sale. The buyer must be satis-
fied with the carpet and the carpet company cannot
allege that he was unreasonable in being dissatisfied
with the carpet if he choses to return it. In this sit-
uation, no title passes until the buyer has shown
satisfaction, either by express statements or by re-
tention of the carpet beyond the specified three day
trial period.
There is another form of sales more acceptable to
mail order houses and merchants of this class. This
is called the "optional sale", where the title is in-
tended to pass upon delivery, with the buyer having
the option of returning the goods within a limited
time "without further obligations". In other words,
the title passes to the buyer with the possession of
the goods; and if the goods are returned to the
seller, the title automatically reverts when the
goods come back into the possession of the original
owner.
This form of sale frequently raises the question,
"When was there a delivery of the goods"? The
clearest answer appears to be, "at that instant when
the seller has definitely relinquished control of the
goods." Goods shipped on consignment, where the
shipper is the consignee, are still under control of
the shipper (the seller). Ordinarily, transmittal to
the carrier constitutes delivery.
Warranty
The buyer's dissatisfaction with the goods fre-
quently raises the issue as to what the seller war-
rants. If the warranty is expressed, it is not so dif-
ficult to determine the rights of the parties. But
most of the misunderstanding develops on implied
.warranties. Thus, a seller impliedly warrants that
lie has title to the goods and if the buyer is acting
in good faith he is under no legal obligation to ques-
tion the authenticity of seller's title.
There is no implied warranty of quality, though
it must be of that class represented by the sale. The
article must be in a merchantable state, as estab-
lished by the "custom of the trade". If it is food,
it must be fit to eat. For instance, a porterhouse
nteak is impliedly warranted to be that particular
cut of beef known as porterhouse steak. But there
is no implication of quality, i.e. that it will be ten-
der. If the buyer is interested in the quality of the
goods, he should set up clearly the specifications lie
desires. This is a protection not only to the buyer
in getting what he wants, but to the seller in plan-
ning on precisely what he must furnish.
The buyer can also protect himself by "sale by
sample". In that case the law will be most specific
in requiring a very certain and definite1 compliance
with the sample furnished.
A warranty of "fitness for special service" raises
an issue of particular interest to the engineer. If a
pump is ordered for a particular type of mine work,
and the seller supplies a pump especially con-
structed for this job, using his own judgment as to
all of the requirements of the design, he is respon-
sible for its satisfactory performance. His liability
is supported on the grounds that the buyer relied
absolutely on the judgment of the seller. On the
other hand if the buyer purchases a certain pump
from the stock list of the firm's output, relying on
his own judgment as to the appropriateness of the
pump selected, there is no implied warrant}- as to
the results obtainable.
Bona fide sale transactions will not cause any

But the telephone
conversation must not freeze
A sudden cold snap might seriously inter-
fere with long distance telephone service were
it not for the studies made by Bell System
engineers.
They found that temperature variations
within 24 hours may make a ten-thousandfold
difference in the amount of electrical energy
transmitted over a New York - Chicago cable
circuit! On such long circuits initial energy
is normally maintained by repeaters or ampli-
fiers, installed at regular intervals. So the
engineers devised a regulator—operated by
weather conditions—which automatically con-
trols these repeaters, keeping current always
at exactly the right strength for proper voice
transmission.
This example is typical of the interesting
problems that go to make up telephone work.

—a paradox
IN search for a material with the characteristics
of both an insulator and a conductor, General
Electric engineers developed Thyrite.
Thyrite, from the Greek word for "gate," is a
new ceramic compound, 50 per cent stronger
than granite. Its outstanding characteristic of
changing automatically from an insulator to an
excellent conductor requires only an increase
in applied voltage. Passage of current through
it conforms to a definite law. Its performance,
exactly the same with direct or alternating volt-
age, slow or fast impulse, is unchanging.
The performance of lightning arresters using
Thyrite can be predicted accurately for any
operating condition.
The development of Thyrite was accomplished
by college-trained General Electric engineers
—a typical achievement in one of the countless
fields for electrical activity. Preliminary experi-
ence in the Testing Department, where younger
men are in training, is a valuable preparation
for responsible positions and future success.

LINDE PROCESS SERVICE ASSURES
YOU EVERY ADVANTAGE OF
OXWELDING AND CUTTING
IN planning a new metal product
or improving an old one, Linde
Process Service places at the dis-
posal of Linde users an unparalleled
knowledge of the oxy-acetylene
process of welding and cutting. This service effectively supplements the
work of your own engineers in obtaining maximum design advantages,
production economies, and complete dependability. Typical examples of
Linde Process Service include —
Assistance to a manufacturer in remaking a broken cast iron generator
yoke on an urgently fast schedule. This unit was redesigned for fabrica-
tion from oxy-acetylene shape-cut steel by welding.
Cooperation with another manufacturer in designing for welded pro-
duction a steel forming press. Dependability was achieved at exceptionally
low cost through the use of oxy-acetylene shape-cut steel.
Helping an aircraft builder design a "hot spot" for fuel heating. The
necessary compactness of this device could be obtained only by oxwelding.
Lightness without sacrifice of strength was essential.
Tomorrow's engineers will be expected to know how to apply the oxy-acetylene
process of welding and cutting metals. For their assistance, we have prepared several
interesting technical booklets explaining how this modern metal-working process Is
used in the design, construction, and fabrication of metal parts and structures. These
books contain newer ond more practical material than most texts and will form a helpful
addition to your personal library. Write to us and we will send them to you without charge.

at Louisville, Kentucky
By A. S. Hoefflin, '23E
THE development of the "Falls of the Ohio"
at Louisville, Kentucky, is unique in that it
is a major water power development located
within the limits of a city of more than 300,000
population.
The "Falls" at this point are in reality a series of
rapids over which the river descends about twenty-
eight feet in a distance of two miles. For many
years these rapids presented a natural barrier to
river transportation, making it necessary to unload
all cargoes and to convey them around the obstruc-
tion in horse drawn or ox drawn vehicles. In 1830
a canal, known as the Louisville and Portland
Canal, was completed by the U. S. Government and
private interests, and for the first time steamboats
could pass around the Falls. This was the begin-
ning of the canalization of the Ohio River and it
enabled the greatest single impediment to naviga-
tion on the river to be overcome.
The development of power in substantial quantity
from the Falls had long been a dream of those whose
vision extends beyond physical difficulties, although
longer than a hundred years ago a small amount of
power was developed for grinding corn. The full
and practical realization of this dream was delayed
until 1927.
The present hydraulic development, as a whole,
serves a double purpose. The dam, an L-shaped
concrete structure some 8680 feet long, is a part of
the recently completed U. S. Government canal-
ization project of the Ohio River, and, as such,
serves to control and maintain a nine-foot pool stage
for navigation in the seventy-four mile section of
river above Louisville. The airplane view looking
upstream, shows this dam paralleling the Pennsyl-
vania Railroad bridge from the Indiana shore to
midstream, and then extending down the middle of
the river to a point opposite the power station. The
hydro-electric power house, integral with the dam
at its lower end on the Kentucky side, houses eight
hydro-electric units capable of generating 108,000
horsepower total at the maximum head of thirty-
seven feet. The entire project was constructed by
one organization; the dam for the U. S. Govern-
ment, and the power plant for a subsidiary of the
Louisville Gas and Electric Company under license
from the Federal Power Commission. Actual con-

struction began late in 1925, and the plant was com-
pleted in 1928.
The design and operation of any hydro-electric
development reflects the peculiarities of the stream
upon which it is located. The area drained by the
Ohio River above Louisville is extensive, amount-
ing to more than 91,000 square miles and extending
well into New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and
Maryland. Despite this large area and the generous
rainfall on the western slopes of the Appalachians,
the natural flow of the river is unstable, varying
from about 792,000 cubic feet per second at the
time of maximum flood, to about 5,000 cubic feet per
second or less during summer drought. This wide
variation in flow, and the resulting variation in
river stage at this point, affected the design of the
power house and its equipment.
It was found that the plant would be subject to
variations in head ranging from zero at time of
high flow to thirty-seven feet maximum at times of
low flow. Because of its ability to perform efficient-
ly under such conditions, a five-blade propeller type
axial flow runner, designed to develop 13,500 horse-
power at thirty-seven feet net effective head at a
speed of one hundred revolutions per minute was
selected. Each runner is made of cast steel, is
fifteen feet in diameter and weighs twenty tons. It
is coupled to the generator rotor by a twenty-three
inch diameter vertical shaft sixty-one feet long. The
generators are of the vertical revolving field type,
alternators rated at 12,580 kv-a., 80 per cent power
factor, 14,000 volts, 100 r.p.m. To assure cleanliness
and to afford means for effective fire protection,
each generator is totally enclosed and equipped
with generator air coolers.
Records of past river floods showed that the
greatest height ever reached by the river during any
flood was 448 feet above sea level, or twenty-eight
feet above the normal upper pool. Since the gen-
erator floor had been placed at 436 feet above sea
level, it was necessary to include in the building

design a concrete wall two feet thick and sixteen
feet high, reinforced to withstand water pressure,
entirely around the generator room.
The operation of the general hydraulic develop-
ment is based on a two-fold plan. First, a fixed pool
elevation above the dam must be maintained for the
benefit of navigation; and second, all available
power from the river must be converted into useful
electrical energy. A careful study of river records
for the past fifty years has shown that an average
of about 390,000,000 kilowatt-hours of electrical
energy may be developed annually, although the
variation from year to year extends over rather
wide limits.
The operation of the dam and all decisions affect-
ing the control of river stages for navigation are
under the supervision of the U. S. Engineer Corps
of the War Department. The operation of the
power plant is under the supervision of the operat-
ing company for which is was built, and the two
groups cooperate on all matters affecting the de-
velopment as a whole. The electrical output is
transmitted by means of 66 ks. steel tower transmis-
sion lines to the various distributing centers in and
about Louisville and also by means of a 138 kv. steel
tower transmission line to Cincinnati, Ohio. The
ing at Louisville of this latter high voltage trans-
mission line may be observed in the foreground of
the photograph.
Many modern features of automatic and super-
visory control have been incorporated in the power
house equipment. Automatic protective devices
will remove a unit from service for any of the fol-
lowing reasons:
1. A. C. overvoltage.
2. Grounded armature winding.
3. Overheated bearings.
4. Loss of excitation.
5. Overspeed.
6. Low oil pressure.
A centrally located miniature switchboard makes
it possible for an operator to control all the major
operations of the station, including starting, syn-
chronizing, controlling load and voltage, and shut-
ting down for any unit. After the simple turning
of a key in this board, all the sequence of events
necessary to start a unit, bring it up to speed, and
put it on the line is thereafter automatically per-
formed. Likewise, turning another key will there-
after cause a unit to automatically be removed from
the line and shut down. In addition, the control
board operator has before him buttons for controll-
ing load and voltage and meters which give a visual
indication of load and voltage on each unit. Oper-

ARCHITECTURE
By I. K. POND, '79A
ON its functional side architecture is a product
of the mind; of reason. On its aesthetic side
it is a product of emotion; of the sensibili-
ties. The factor which chiefly distinguishes man
from the rest of the animal creation is reason. Emo-
tion and sensibility seem to be displayed in varying'
measure throughout the vast animal kingdom. In
man alone seems to reside the capacity for sustained
and synthesizing reason. When man fails to temper
his emotions and activities with reason he ap-
proaches the animal state. The animal, however, is
forbidden by nature's laws to produce results as fu-
tile as those not infrequently produced by unreason-
ing, emotional man. Reasoned emotionalism in man
is a saving grace. Pure emotionalism may, possibly
will, lead to heights of folly. Pure reason may point
the road to despair. Reason untouched by emotion
points to the inevitable; in the inevitable there is
no ground for hope. The human soul craves free-
dom—and variety in freedom. It craves the power
to achieve unity from all that variety which freedom
grants. The human soul craves unity; for unity
underlies those fundamental necessities of humanity
—religion and art. Religion unifies its object and
places at unity with the environing universe that
object unified within itself. Does art do anything
less?
Art and religion, fundamentally, are social factors.
As social factors they are related to human activity
in all its phases. Each, however, may be discussed
on its own merits. It is our present purpose to
view only a certain phase of art, that known as
architecture and, that, not in its entirety. Religion
and certain other factors will enter only by implica-
tion.
There are three laws which underlie the archi-
tectural manifestation. These are the laws of unity,
measure and purpose. Xone of these is as easy of
fulfilment as would appear at first glance. Unity is
a thoroughly abstract concept to be made concrete
only through the operation of a spiritual law. Meas-
ure is a still more abstract concept, one also to be
made concrete and effective only through the inter-
vention of a rare spirituality. Purpose would seem
very concrete. The object should serve its purpose!

Colleges Lead in Industrial Power Research
Definite evidence of the importance of research
to modern industry, and the way in which educa-
tional institutions are lending their technical aid
to the solution of problems of better production is
seen by a study of a table listing all research in
power and allied fields during the last three years,
reported in a special research number of the engi-
neering periodical Power.
During 1929. 1931 and 1931 there were over 800
research investigations into all phases of steam,
water and electrical power production and use in
progress in the world's laboratories. The way in
which university and college laboratories are mak-
ing their expert advice available to the business
man and engineer, is seen in the figures for the
United States. Of the 671 investigations in this
country, 317 were being carried out in the academic
surroundings of 49 different colleges, 125 by manu-
facturing companies, 117 by operating companies,
and 112 in various other laboratories.
The American colleges most active in this work,
include the University of Michigan, whose Depart-
ment of Engineering Research worked on 37 power
problems; the University of Illinois, and its Engi-
neering Experimental Station, with 34; Purdue
University with 19; Vale with 16; and Ohio State
with 14. Of similar scientific work done outside
this country, Germany leads with 109 investiga-
tions, many in her famous universities and technical
schools, and a number sponsored by a government
technical organization, the Reichskohlenrat. Japan,
youngest of the industrial nations, is third in t'le
world in power investigation, having 57 projects
under way, 24 of which are being studied at Wa-
seda, Osaka, and other Japanese centers of technical
knowledge.

UNIVERSITY LIBRARY LIGHTING
Long hours of intent study in college libraries-
call for ample, glareless light to avoid eye strain
and fatigue, and in achieving this end the lighting
system of the University of Michigan General Li-
brary has set a vogue which is being followed in
many reading rooms. The new modernistic li-
brary of the New School for Social Research is
one of the latest to adopt the Michigan style lamp.
Arrived at after several years of experimentation
by H. H. Higbie, Professor of Electrical Engineer-
ing, the lamp is simple in its essentials. An in-
verted Y-shaped trough running the whole length
of the table forms the shade of the lamp. At in-
tervals, near the top angle of this shade, electric
bulbs are set, enclosed along the whole length of
the table by a shield of thick opal glass which so
diffuses the light that the table top is illuminated
with a strong soft light, free from shadows or glar-
ing highlights from the polished surface. A mirror
facing on the under side of the shade aids in util-
izing all light.
Set lower than most reading lamps, the shade
of the Michigan type prevents any direct light from
reaching the reader's eyes, as well as avoiding glare
to persons moving about the room. Perhaps the
fact that the long lamp at eye level shuts off stray
glances at pretty co-eds a few tables away has an
important psychological effect also in concentrat-
ing attention on the work at hand.
In addition to the special table lamps, the large
Michigan study hall, which is one hundred and
forty feet long, forty-eight feet wide and fifty feet
high, is lighted over all by an indirect system in
which the light from lamps set in the tops of wall
book shelves is reflected downward from the domed
ceiling, producing a soft shadowless all over illumi-
nation approximating north daylight.

One of the most fascinating corners of that all
absorbing study of human nature in which we are
all forced to indulge in order to get anything worth
while out of life lies in the traceries of success. Just
what qualities, inherent or acquired, make a suc-
cessful man? The realization that it would be
extremely difficult for any man to directly and
whole heartedly answer that question is brought to
the surface by a mere personal consideration of how
you would reply to it yourself. In fact, there seems
to be only one method of attack by which one can
assure himself of anything like definite opinions on
the subject and that resides in an unselfish and
understanding appreciation of biography and re-
views. Since it is undoubtedly true that many of
the world's most powerful personalities have been
inspired by a greatly admired predecessor, we are
sure to provide interesting and worth while material
for someone when we present a sketch of the life
of a man who has achieved so many valuable labors
as has Lawrence V. Kerber.
After passing, one by one, the milestones of a
very ordinary youth, Mr. Kerber entered the Uni-
versity of Michigan in 1914 where he was imme-
diately hailed as "Larry," everyone's pal, a man who
made friends so easily that his engaging personality
and winning smile were bywords wherever he went.
In 1918 he graduated, leaving his sunny student
clays behind and departing from a host of warm
comrades in clear old Ann Arbor, the home of his
alma mater. Soon after waving goodbye to the
sunswept seclusion of the college campus he joined
the Army Air Corps and while serving at McCook
Field in Dayton, Ohio, as Chief of the Flight Re-
search branch, Chief of Airplane Design, and Chief
of the Aerodynamics Section, he gained nationwide
renown as a leader in the newly grown up aero-
nautics industry. As a direct result of his activities
here he was appointed to the University of Michi-
gan as Daniel Guggenheim Professor of Applied
Aerodynamics and began putting his original ideas
into ambitious practice. He was directly responsible
for organizing one of the very first classes in air
Lawrence V. Kerber.
transportation ever offered in a University while
here in 1927.
In 1928 the government was attracted by his
numerous successes and recognized his abilities by
naming him Chief of the Engineering Section, Air
Regulations Division, Department of Commerce, an
honor which occasioned his withdrawal as an active
teacher. He continued with marked success in this
position until he resigned in 1929 to become Presi-
dent and member of the Board of the Spartan
Aircraft Company of Tulsa, Oklahoma. Here his
phenominal rise has continued. He has been busy
designing several civil and military planes and has
prepared many manuals and articles connected with
his work which have proven inestimably valuable
to his colleagues. He is now busy writing fifty
thousand words as his contribution to an encyclo-
pedia on aerodynamic theory being sponsored by
the Guggenheim Foundation. He also was recently
honored by being named one of the sixteen men
serving on the Board of Class A Governors of the
Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce.
It is certainly with regret that we must leave this
recital, feeling that these few words have failed to
do complete justice to such a successful career. We
realize that an ever glowing tribute should be payed
to him for his work but we know that the continued
accomplishment which he is bound to achieve will
more than repay such toil as is sure to accompany
its attainment. With these last lines we leave him
to your thought, hoping that you may all get as
much pleasure out of reading about his upward
climb as we have in telling of the dynamic character
of an eminent engineer,

Phi Kappa Phi
On Thursday, December 10, fifty-seven seniors
in the various colleges and schools in the University
were initiated into Phi Kappa Phi, national honor-
ary scholastic fraternity. The men chosen from
the College of Engineering were: Marshall Ander-
son, Robert Barr, Paul Clement, Harry Chese-
brough, Byron Coats, Gary Muffly, Kingsley Peck,
William Tippy and August Trometer. From the
College of Architecture: Malcolm Stirton.
1932 Summer School
During the Summer Session of 1932 Michigan
expects an increase in enrollment possibly greater
in proportion than in the summer of 1931, which set
a record. In expressing this conviction, Dean
Edward H. Kraus of the Summer Session pointed
out that the unsettled financial conditions which
have prevented many from attending the regular
sessions in universities and colleges will probably
have the affect of maintaining or enlarging summer
school enrollments.
While a majority of courses in the Summer Ses-
sion may be elected for undergraduate credit, the
departments offering work which may be elected
by both graduates and undergraduates, or graduates
exclusively, have been extensively enlarged and
strengthened, since the older students form a major
share of the summer attendance. Among those
which have been especially extended are chemical
engineering, which enjoyed a 60 per cent increase
in 1931, and engineering mechanics.
o
Machine "Eye" Developed
FLAWS of even microscopic size have no
chance to pass by the eagle eye of a new in-
spection device perfected at the University
of Michigan, which not only spots an error in less
than one ten thousandth of a second, but remembers
it until a complete examination has been made and
the faulty product shunted into discard. The
mechanical inspector was developed by Professor
Floyd Firestone for the University Department of
Engineering Research.
In operation the inspector is swift, sure, and not
especially complicated. The object to be examined,
any piece of metal shiny enough to reflect light well,
is held in a clamp and revolved. As it revolves it
also passes under the lens of a microscope, the light
from the metal surface passing through the micro-
scope to a diaphram which takes the place of the
eye-piece, and is pierced by a slit an eighth of an
inch long and a few thousandths \vide.
This tiny beam of light falls upon a photo-electric
or selenium cell, the latter having the peculiar habit
of changing its resistance to the passage of electri-
city when affected by changes in light intensity. If
a flaw or crack appears on the product being viewed
by the microscope lens, it at once alters the quantity
of light from this area, and this is noted or "seen"
almost instantly by the photo-electric cell, which
experiences a change in the current passing through
it.
The cell will react to a change in one ten thous-
andth of a second, but this is too short to operate
relay switches to turn the faulty material into dis-
card, so a "memory" had to be devised. This took
the form of a gas filled radio tube which came into
action when the fluctuating current from the photo-
electric cell was amplified and passed through it.
Current from this tube actuates a magnet, which in
turn sets the apparatus for automatic discard. The
discharge in the gas filled tube continues once
started, thus remembering the flaw by keeping the
discard path open. Once the inspection of the whole
piece is completed, it is shunted aside and the mem-
ory tube reset automatically for the coming of the
next piece.
Although the new inspecting device is especially
rapid in examination of round objects, such as auto-
mobile pistons, which can be revolved and moved
forward at the same time, it may also be used on
any object with a light-reflecting surface, such as
sheet tin, as well as being adapted to do various
sorting jobs, says Professor Firestone.
A NOVEL AUTOMATIC OILING SYSTEM
A novel automatic oiling system for industrial
machinery and automobile chassis has been devel-
oped recently in Detroit, Michigan. This device
operates electrically without pump or other moving
parts.
It consists of an oil tank equipped with an elec-
tric heater unit which is separated from direct con-
tact with the oil. When the machine that is to be
lubricated is started, the heater unit inside the tank
is automatically turned on.

HERE'S THE NEWS—
Hello there Mr. Alumnus:
Here we are back again for just one more little
visit before the pall of final examinations precludes
the possibility of enjoying any more of these little
chats for another month or so. We hope you're
all well these days and still interested in hearing all
the news concerning all those former classmates
of yours. Where do you suppose Jim, or Jack or
any of the rest of them are knocking about now?
Well here's the gossip as its been picked up by the
alumni news monger.
1893
Here's the first choice one. A little bird informs
us that your old Ann Arbor pal, Joseph J. Morsman,
is now with the National Lead Company as Assist-
ant Manager of the corporation's Chicago branch
office. Joe's address, in case you want to do him
a favor and drop him a line, is Chicago Beach Hotel,
East Hyde Park Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois.
1904
This little corner of the gossip god's robe has
travelled up from the American Appraisal Com-
pany's offices at 38 South Dearborn Street, Chicago,
the present location of Harris P. Ralston. This
latter gentleman is now Contract Manager for that
company.
1906
This will be welcome news for you, we're betting.
Did you know that William R. Hoeck of the good
old days at Michigan has
been spending the last ten
years of his life in Detroit,
Michigan ? He has been with
the Packard Motor Car Co.,
as an automatic Tool Engi-
neer, is married and lives at
7901 Freda Avenue, Dear-
born, Michigan. Why not
write and say hello, you
haven't seen Bill for a long
time?
Word has been received
from the hangout of the
Boilermakers that Ralph B.
Wiley, whom so many of
you must remember, is now
a venerable and respected
Professor of Sanitary Engineering at the University
of Purdue. To refresh your memory Lafayette,
Indiana is the geographical location.
1911
Wre have received well substantiated word that
Ray L. Spitzley, another classmate of many of you
has recently been singularly honored by the Na-
tional Heating and Piping Contractors Association
of New York City. His recent election to the Presi-
dency of that society when it met in Louisville, Ky.,
climaxed several years of prominence in its activ-
ities. Ray is now President of the R. L. Spitzley
Heating Company of Detroit, Michigan, and may
be addressed in Grosse Point at 1050 Yorkshire Rd.
1915
The Johns-Manville Sales Corporation is the
source of a very interesting item concerning Ray-
mond S. Hemmingson which we know will prove
welcome to all of his many old friends. He is now
a District Engineer with that organization and is
residing in Grosse Point Village, Detroit, Michigan,
at 846 Lincoln Road.
1918
Some more news, this time from Aurora, Illinois,
and just waiting to be passed on to those who will
probably be most interested in it. It concerns one
Carl E. Gormsen, well known in University of Mich-
igan circles, who is now em-
ployed by the Richards Wil-
cox Manufacturing Com-
pany as an engineer. His
residence address is 422
Grand Avenue.
Talk has it that Elbridge
Dudley is now the proud
father of a son, born nine
months ago. He is connected
with the General Electric
Company and is located in
the district office at 120
Broadway, New York City.
1922
A slight error in our De-
cember run of Alumni gossip
has recently come to our
attention. An item regard-

tained mistaken information. We apologize for our
incorrect statement, Mr. Pitkin, and hope you have
not been too seriously offended.
Information has dropped in that Homer F. Ros-
bach is now in business in Benton Harbor where he
is with the manufacturing concern, F. P. Rosbach
&amp; Company, builders of printing machinery. Re-
member Homer well enough to drop him a line?
He lives in Benton Harbor at 918 Colfax Avenue.
Next we bring in a bit about Elton W. Viets, now
in Lansing, Michigan, as a Sales Engineer with the
New Way Engine and Machine Company. He lives
in Flint at 401 Weller Street.
This comes in from Washington, D. C. Lynn C.
Winans, formerly associated with Sidney Aftel in
Toledo, Ohio, as an architect, has taken up his
duties in the national capitol where he recently
was appointed an Assistant Architect in the Navy
Department.
1923
Another Chicago broadcast the Hubbard, W'ar-
ren, and Chandler Company, 208 South LaSalle
Street, wants us to know that Thomas A. Belknap
is now employed as their solicitor.
We wonder how many of you have been keeping
track of another of your old friends, Arthur E.
Coates? If you've missed him here's the dope. He
is now Vice-president of the Coates Steel Products
Company, Box 185, Greenville, Illinois, and would
welcome news about any one of you.
1924
And this is the story of a good engineer who
made a better groceryman, if you're looking for
anomalies. William Graulich Jr., now lives at 160
Elm Street, Orange, New Jersey. He has risen
through the dint of hard and successful labor to
the position of Treasurer of William Graulich, Inc.,
Retail Grocers.
1925
\Vhat about this old pal of yours? Did you know
that Herbert Rankin Poland has worked for the
Standard Oil Company of New Jersey for the last
seven years? His position is that of experimental
and industrial engineer on oil cracking. He is
married and lives in Elizabeth, New Jersey, at 435
Westminster Avenue.
1926
And now we come to what rumor has to say
about one you should all know well. He is a former
member of the Technic and Daily staffs, and the
freshman football team. Knox B. Howe is the
gentleman and he is now a petroleum engineer with
the Humble Oil and Refining Company in Houston,
Texas.
Curiously enough this is an item which we are
as sorry to have to pass on as we were to receive it.
It concerns Clarence M. Ellicock whom many of
us here still well remember and liked. He was
killed in Lynchburg, Va., last April when he crashed
to instantaneous death while demonstrating a plane
for the Buhl Aircraft Corporation in whose employ
he worked as a pilot.
The Eastman Kodak Company in Rochester.
N.Y., is responsible for the news that Stuart For-
sythe is now hard at work in their research labs.
Last year he was still here on the campus as a stu-
dent assistant in the Mechanical Engineering De-
partment.
And with that I guess we have exhausted the
month's gossip or what do you know about who
columns. See you again next month hoping to have
a lot of nice juicy bits for your scrapbook.

Function and Scale in Architecture
(Continued from page 7)
What could be more simple? The object should
function. That is, in a building the plan should
function to the prescribed uses of the building. The
structural forms should function structurally. Even
today is heard the echo of an old hollow sounding
call—"form should follow function"—uttered by
men with slight idea of the full implication of "func-
tion" in a complicated society, and a very confused
nation as to the significance of form. But function
touches more than use and material form; it has
spiritual connotations; it touches the moral and
aesthetic strings of the social instrument. Form, to
nil its part, must not only clothe function with truth
so that function through the form shall proclaim its
material use and structural bearing, but form must
also proclaim the spiritual relation of the function-
ing object to the mind and heart of society. In other
words, the form must relate the function to human
.ife. It must minister to the cravings of the human
soul. Thus, the form in which structure is ebbodied
must not alone proclaim the structural intent, but
must carry, clearly and unswervingly, a conviction
of truth and beauty to the human soul. The satis-
fied human soul will round out the category by find-
ing it "good."
This conviction of truth, goodness and beauty
comes through the operation of the law of measure;
unity follows obedience to that law. Relationships
must be just; thought must balance act; force must
balance restraint; too much must not be pitted
against too little, nor too little against too much.
Calmness and poise will control the play of the emo-
tions. Spiritual elation will not outrun physical
strength. Perfection through moderation is the aim.
Following the implications of the above concep-
tion of function, architecture must in its dominant
mass and component parts relate itself, or be related,
to human understanding and the powers of human
comprehension. This relation is produced by scale.
The mass should not overpower the human brain or
the human heart. Mass in itself is not overpower-
ing and depressing; it is the spirit in the mass
which overpowers and depresses, or which invites
sympathy and impels understanding.
Many functionalists have maintained that a form
which properly clothes function, that is, an object
which functions, must necessarily and for that rea-
son be beautiful. If that were so in what would lie
the choice between Apollo and Caliban; between
Page Fourteen

tionalist "would," as Hamlet says, "reserve some
quantity of choice to serve in such a difference."
Function may be clothed in forms of ugliness or in
forms of beauty. How function shall be clothed in
architecture depends upon the will and spirit resid-
ing in the architect. Adaptation to site and environ-
ment, as well as adaptation to social needs, will
be controlling factors in the determination of form.
Here we must consider more fully that other de-
termining factor—scale. Scale, as touching mass,
detail, and environment, is governed by the law of
measure; for the law must control in all human
activities in both the material and spiritual realms,
if humanity is to reach its highest ideal. As indi-
cated above, that which depresses and overpowers
the human spirit, is not in perfect scale, or in other
words, does not possess scale.
Immensity, as of the universe for instance, may
once have overpowered and depressed humanity.
Overhanging supersitions from primitive religions
would seem to proclaim as much. But the human
mind has expanded, and today man measures the
infinite distances and weighs the stars. His mind
projects itself to the bounds of space on beams of
light. His spirit expands rather than shrinks in
the presence of infinity. It is attuned to the uni-
verse and is at rest; for the universe has scale.
Man turns his physical eye back to earth and his
gaze falls upon some work of architecture, or upon
some other emination of the human spirit, and is
depressed and overpowered; for in that particular
object scale does not exist and there is no evidence
that right relationships, internal or external, ever
were considered in its design. Externally it appears
like a powder magazine in an environment of fragile
porcelain flowers; or perhaps, like a fantastic harle-
quin amidst a gathering of sober-minded citizens.
Internally it may seem that elements of heaviness
and fantasy have been introduced in inharmonious
juxtaposition. All this in masses large or small.
And then within the mass. Portals too large or too
small; windows mechanically rising story on story
between massive piers simulating structural ma-
sonry; towards the top setback stories through
which the piers continue with undiminished face
and deepening and exaggerated reveals; all of which
causes the building in point of strength and carry-
ing power to seem inverted, especially when this
topheavy mass rises out of an extensive base of
plate glass framed in refined mouldings and em-
bellished with delicate ornament.
No where does a sense of lacking appreciation of
scale show more, in modern architecture, than in
the appearance of crude and massive ornament in
the upper stories of tall buildings, where decorative
forms should be flattened and refined rather than
exaggerated. Decoration in the upper reaches is

buildings, and this fact should be considered as well
as that the detail is to be seen by pedestrians in
the street. All that the busy pedestrian really needs
to ease his aesthetic path is the feeling, gained gen-
erally in the most cursory glance, that the buildings
about him are comfortably seated on firm bases and
grow consistently lighter and more graceful as the
lines bear upward. The principle involved is as
valid for low, few-storied as for lofty, many-storied
structures.

scale, abstract forms of decoration should be used
as ornamental embellishment where such embellish-
ment seems needed. Embellishment is needed only
when the forms embodying structural function are,
because of the complexities of the general function-
ing, inadequate to supply the needed grace and
charm. These two characteristics, grace and charm,
so vital to the proper unfolding of a civilized exist-
ence in society, are sadly wanting in much of mod-
ern art. The expression of grace and charm in
other and superficial ages seems artificial in the eyes
of a more sincere generation. Our own age needs
for its art and life the qualities of mind and heart
which make for grace and charm and their most
sincere expression. Modern art forms seem, how-
ever, resolutely to have stripped themselves of all
vestiges of charm, evidently considering charm in
the category of weakness. But charm is an illusive
quality; it is not caught as a butterfly in a net but
is the resultant of ages of good breeding. It is pre-
sent in great and lasting art; it is present in sincere
social relationships.
We are the products of our age and, as architects,
we must study its functioning so that we may give
it expression in form—the most perfect and charac-
teristic functioning in the most perfect and charac-
teristic form. Forms which attract or repel human-
ity in one age are not necessarily those which are
attractive or repellant in another. Each age is a
law unto itself. Herein lies the great responsibility
of the architect—he who, as creator, breathes the
spirit into the form. He should know his age and
the social ideals, and knowing, should minister
faithfully to them. Thus will his buildings however
huge, however small, find lodgement in the heart
of his fellows and be acceptable to their reason.
Unity will dwell in the mass; measure will control
throughout; and beneficent purpose will be served.

The temperature of the oil is raised which causes
expansion and forces oil out of the tank to the hear-
ings where proper metering devices control the flow
of oil. After the temperature has reached 150 de-
grees a thermostat breaks contact and allows the
oil to cool to 100 degrees. At that temperature the
thermostatic switch again makes contact.
During the cooling process a vacuum occurs
which is utilized to refill the tank from a central
supply or reservoir. To prevent drawing of oil
back from the bearings, a check valve is used in
the main feed line. To maintain the pressure on
the main line while the tank is refilling, an ingenious
auxiliary feeder is installed which continues to hold
the pressure while the tank is being replenished.
Therefore there is no time during the operation that
there is a lack of pressure in the feed line. This
oiling system operates every two hours.
In automobile chassis lubrication, a very small
tank is installed in the channel of the frame, and
new oil is taken either from the central tank or from
a built-in tank in the filler spout of the motor.
Rvery time oil is put into the engine, it automati-
cally refills the tank on the filler spout, thus assur-
ing at all times clean oil for the system.

The U. S. S. Akron while on the ground outside
its dock is hitched to a strange-looking, three-legged
device. This machine—a low, tripod mooring mast
on caterpillar wheels—is a recent development to
facilitate the ground handling of large airships. A
huge airshap can be left moored to it, to swing in
the breeze like a colossal weather-vane, overnight
or for a week if need be. Also it is used to tow an
airship out of or into the dock; it replaces the hun-
dreds of men previously required to tag, like ants
at a huge worm, on the lines dangling from the
ship to move it about.
The mobile mooring mast at Akron was designed
and built to be used with the ZRS-4, christened
by Mrs. Hoover as the "Akron", and the ZRS-5
now under construction for the U. S. Navy, and
with future ships constructed at the dock of the
Goodyear-Zeppelin Corporation.
The three legs of the tripod rest on caterpillar
feet equally spaced on a hundred foot circle. At
the apex, 76 feet above the ground, is the cone-
shaped cup into which fits the cone on the bow of
the airship—the mast-to-ship connection agreed
upon internationally as standard.
Two of the caterpillars provide the traction and
are driven b ya 125 hp., 250-volt direct-current
motor mounted on the framework between them.

gear and long' drive shafts with universal joints.
The third caterpillar is for steering. It is driven
by an 8-hp. motor through a rack and pinion system.
The mast also carries its own power plant. Sup-
ported on the cross members of its base is a small
house containing a 250-lip. 1200 rpm. gasoline en-
gine driving a 125 kw.. 250 volt direct-current gen-
erator and a combination exciter and auxiliary
generator rated at 18-kw., 125 volts.
Besides supplying power to steer and propel the1
mast, the main generator furnishes power for the
30 hp. winch motor, which hauls in the main moor-
ing' line of the airship. Simultaneous operation of
the winch motor and the traction motor is pre-
vented automotically by the contactor system.
These contactors are mounted on a panel in the
generator room.
All electric controls are located in the pilot room
just above the power plant. From this position,
M&gt;me twenty feet above the ground, the pilot can
see clearly on all sides and control the direction
and speed of the mast. Uring variable-voltage con-
trol the speed can be varied from a quarter to two
and a half miles per hour.
The mast, while serving as a mooring for an
airship on the field, also supplies the power for
servicing the ship with water and fuel. The motor-
driven pumps are mounted on the base cross mem-

per minute from the ground through a hose running
up one leg of the mast and into the bow of the
ship. One hundre dgallons of water per minute
are pumped by the other unit through a similar hose
connection. Control switches for the pumps are
located both at the motors rind at the platform at
the top of the mast.
Swiveling floodlights are mounted at each corner
of the mast, and colored lights are displayed in
various combinations to indicate wind velocity data
to the airship. The mast electrical system can also
furnish power to the ship's electrical system—mak-
ing it unnecessary to keep the ship's power plant
in operation when not in flight.

Powerful Light Aids Air Maneuvers
An innovation in aviation accomplishments was
demonstrated recently by Captain Eaton, command-
ant of Rogers Field when he flew over Pittsburgh
in a Curtis bombing plane with a tremendously
powerful searchlight mounted on his ship and set
off a Hare located on the top of the William Penn
Hotel.
The event, which demonstrated a new develop-
ment in aviation and, at the same time, ho\v me-
chanical action maj' be controlled by means of a
light beam, \\ a senacted as one of the features ut
the convention of the Illuminating Kngineers So-
ciety.
This new searchlight, a very compact unit weigh-
ing a little more than 50 pounds and about 18 inches
in diameter, may throw a beam visible more than
50 miles. This small unit employs a 250 watt lam]&gt;
and may be operated from an ordinary storage bat-
tery. It concentrates a narrow beam of light so
powerful that a newspaper may be read at a dis-
tance of five miles.
It is the world's smallest searchlight and yet one
of the most powerful. Because it is so light and
small and since it may be operated from a battery,
it becomes possible to mount it in an airplane.
To demonstrate the possibilities which exist for
this unit in aerial service when associated with light
sensitive tubes, sometimes termed "electric eyes".
Captain Eaton circled the city, then trained his
aerial searchlight on the top of the hotel, where a
photo electric cell had been located.
The instant the searchlight's beam bit the photo
electric cell, it actuated a mechanism setting off a
powerful flare, thus demonstrating the feasibility
of producing mechanical action of any kind by
means of a beam of light.
"Under battle conditions", states Captain Eaton,
"night fliers feel their way in pitch dark far above
enemy lines or cities. With one of the new type
searchlights, it is believed possible to flash the light
on and off and so permit the aviator to see exactly
what was on the ground below. There thus would
be no uncertainty whether or not bombs were fall-
ing on a city. Troop movements at night no longer
would be secret.
"The searchlight, so switched on, would instantly
reveal to the observer's eyes whatever was transpir-
ing below. Switching off the light, the plane would
again be in darkness and when the pilot changes
his position, the enemy would not have time to pick
up the ship with ground lights.
"If the German Zeppelins which raided London
had been equipped with searchlights of the new
type it is fairly certain that they could have done
far more damage than they did when they hovered
high in the air and guessed whether or not they
were above the British capital."

EVERY user of Linde Oxygen is privileged to call upon Linde
Process Service for assistance or advice through any of the
25 Linde District Offices.
Linde Process Service, with its unequalled background of scien-
tific research and field experience, offers every facility for most
effective use of oxy-acetylene welding and cutting. Here are some
of the things it has done.
In the State of Washington, it developed a Procedure Control
for welding band saws, thus saving the lumber industry thousands
of dollars in replacement costs.
In Iowa, it showed a hosiery mill how to alter forms used in
the manufacture of silk stockings, and helped save a capital
expenditure of $16,000.
In New York, it showed a manufacturer how to apply iridium to
fountain pen points economically and without waste.
Tomorrow's engineers will be expected to know how to apply the
oxy-acetylene process of welding and cutting metals. For their
assistance, we have prepared several interesting technical book-
lets explaining how this modern metal-working process is used in
the design, construction, and fabrication of metal parts and struc-
tures. These books contain newer and more practical material
than most texts and will form a helpful addition to your personal
library. Write to us and we will send them to you without charge.

Underwater exhaust
NEVER before have the pages of history
told of such a vivid story of mechanical
development as that of the past few years.
The startling revelation is that this process of evo-
lution is yet in the its early stages. Change after
change is taking place—year after year new meth-
ods are being formulated and new achievements are
being perfected with an eye to comfort and con-
venience. Truly it may be said that the coming
era points more and more to the skill of the tech-
nician.
During this metamorphosis it is of especial in-
terest to note the rapid pace with which the out-
board motor has forged its way to prominence—a
motor uniting outstanding engineering skill and de-
velopments commanding attention to the pleasures
to be derived from the waterways which a few
years ago were not even visualized.
In its first stages the outboard motor was a
heavy, clumsy unit, developing very little horse-
power and speed for its weight and size. It had a
hand starting device which often proved to be a
tiresome and vexsome affair. Its fumes of exhaust
were a menace and its deafening noise of operation
a sore spot. Yet it was this same motor
••—---5. that attracted the attention of two of the
'? country's foremost inventors in the ma-
f ^*K rine industry, who felt the need of certain
J I improvements that would expel hazards
Z—^*f retarding its development. Among the
salient achievements of their engineering
.., genius are high speed, compact, portable
motors embodying such important fea-
tures as the free tilting propeller, under-
water exhaust, pressure vacuum cooling
system, electric starting, full pivot steer-
ing, rotary valve intake, and many other
phenomenal developments that have be-
come almost indispensable.
The free tilting propeller is an impor-
tant advancement which permits naviga-
tion in shallow and snag infested waters,
without the possibility of damage to any
part of the underwater unit.
This tilting is accomplished by hinging
the complete motor about a point at the
top of the drive shaft, immediately be-
cooling
neath the power head. Should the lower unit strike
a submerged object, the boat will continue due to
its own inertia, the hinge will allow the propeller
to tilt, and no harm will be done. After the ob-
struction is passed the propeller will force itself
down to its normal driving position. In addition
to the safety feature, the free tilting allows for
beaching anywhere.
Since outboard motors are of the two-cycle
type, it might be supposed that underwater ex-
hausts would create considerable back pressure.
So skillful has been the design though, that the
power of the present motors has been increased in-
stead of decreased by the addition of the under-
water exhaust. The engineers used two methods
to accomplish this power increase, (1) water cool-
ing and, (2) suction discharge. The exhaust gases
as they leave the cylinders enter the large water
cooled muffler, where the volume is decreased by
the cooling. From the muffler the gases are con-
ducted through a passage (also water cooled) to the
submerged outlet. The lower unit is so designed
that this discharge is into a region of low pres-
sure, created by the rush of water past the housing.
The low pressure, of course, produces a suction
throughout the exhaust system, which draws the
gases out as rapidly as they are formed. How
cleverly the noise and fumes of the motor have been
subdued!
The pressure-vacuum cooling system is another
example of creative engineering and designing
skill. It eliminates the old style water pump and
requires no moving parts or machinery of any
kind. The method of operation is extremely simple.
The force imparted to the water by the propeller
is utilized by placing a scoop in the slip-stream.
From this scoop the water is forced up through con-
cealed piping in the drive shaft casing to the cylin-
ders, where the cooling work is done. The flow of
water is then back to the lower unit to be dis-
charged. Although the pressure behind the pro-
peller is sufficient to produce circulation under al-
most all conditions, the engineers made cooling ab-
solutely positive by so placing the outlet that a
suction helps to draw the water through the sys-
tem. In order to do this the discharge opening is
placed immediately in front of the propeller, at

PARTY WALLS
By Prof. WALTER C. SADLER
The
Lawyers'
Club
IT often happens that two neighboring store
owners erect a common wall on the boundary
line between their properties, using this wall
jointly for the support of their buildings. The ar-
rangement is very desirable, as it avoids the price
of an extra partition as well as economizes in the
use of floor space. Difficulties may arise, however,
when one of the owners desires to replace the half
of this wall which is on his lot with a completely in-
dependent building. In order to determine the
rights of the parties, it is essential to understand
the legal relationship created by this community
wall; to determine what are the general rules gov-
erning the law on Party Walls, and what liability
each neighbor assumes in return for the privilege
of using the joint wall.
Characteristics of a Party Wall
A party wall is that structure built on the
boundary line of two adjacent pieces of land in
which wall each land owner has a property interest.
It is apparent that the property interest in this wall
may take one of several different forms. It can be
built by the two present owners, half of the wall
on each lot, sharing the benefit and expenses equal-
ly. This is a tenancy in common. Again, the wall
may be built entirely by Smith on his own land, and
subsequently, when Smith's neighbor Jones builds.
Smith grants to Jones an easement for a considera-
tion. The rights in this case will be determined
largely by the specific terms of the grant of ease-
ment. Statutes even provide in some states that
under certain conditions a land owner can build a
party wall on the boundary, half on either lot, with
the vacant lot owner later contributing to the cost
thereof if he desires to use the wall jointly.
The facts and usage are essential elements in de-
termining the legal status of any particular party
wall. These circumstances are interpreted in con-
junction with the statutes of the particular juris-
diction. It should be noted that the rights and lia-
bilities existing under party walls was not treated
as such by the common law. It is essentially a
modern problem ; one of which has come to a head
during the intensive building development in our
modern cities. In fact, building codes frequently
provide specifically for regulations regarding party
walls, and it is difficult to conceive of a real job of
underpinning which does not raise this specific issue
in some form.,
There are two main views on the property rights
of a party wall. Thus the English view appears
crystallized in the doctrine that each party owns an
undivided share in the wall. In such a case we
speak of the ownership as a tenancy in common. It
is much the same type of ownership as where a
farm is willed to three sons, share and share alike.
The American view, on the other hand, has
adopted the "cross-easement" doctrine. Thus, each
neighbor owns the lot to the boundary line. ev«;n as
lie did before the party wall was erected, subject
however to this important restriction. His land is
now burdened with an easement for the portion of
the wall resting on his land, running in favor of his
neighbor. And in return for the grant of this bur-
den (this easement), he secures a cross-easement
or right in his neighbor's land to support the party
wall. The American doctrine is better suited to
cope with some of the technical rules raised in com-
plicated party wall controversies.
Location of a Party Wall
In the Louisiana case of Oldstein vs. Firemen's
Building Company, a controversy was raised re-
garding a wall located on the dividing line between
the adjacent properties. The history of this wall
established that there had never been an agreement
between the parties to consider this wall as a party
wall. In addition to the lack of a contract, the two
neighbors had never treated the wall as a party
wall, and the controversy was decided on the basis
that this was not a party wall.
However, the fact that a wall is on a boundary
would raise the presumption that it was intended
as a party wall. A case in point, Weadock vs.
Champe, 160 N. W. 564, was a situation developed
in Michigan in 1916. The two neighbors had never
drawn up a formal agreement that the wall on their
Page Six

as a support for his respective building, and the
court held there was a presumption that it was in-
tended to be a party wall. In all of these cases the
presumption is not conclusive, however, and evi-
dence may be introduced to establish the existence
of a contrary intent of the parties. Windows in the
wall, or use by only one party might be evidence
of this nature. A rather nice example of this type
of rebuttal evidence was brought out in the Mer-
cantile Lumber Company, 220 Fa. 328, decided in
1908. In that situation one of the parties was ob-
ligated to keep an open alley, 16 feet wide, on his
land adjacent to the boundary line. The existence
of this alley was sufficient to overcome any pre-
sumption that his neighbor's wall along their boun-
dary was intended to be a party wall. This type of
issue is frequently raised in party wall controver-
sies, and this Michigan case is in accord with the
decisions in other jurisdictions.
In the Western National Bank case, 102 Pa. 171,
the facts developed that only five inches of the
foundation were on one lot while none of the wall
proper was on this lot. It was there held that the
structure was nevertheless a party wall. In brief,
the wall need not be equally located on each of the
two properties, but it may even be located entire-
ly on one side of the boundary. This is a rather
desirable position of the law, for old walls were fre-
quently located approximately on what was be-
lieved to be the true boundary, while modern sur-
veying has established that an error was made in
the location of the wall. Any other doctrine would
jeopardize the large property interests tied up in
existing old walls of early construction.
Use of Party Walls
It will be recalled that the American treatment
of party walls is based upon the cross-easement,
where each neighbor has the right of support in
that portion of the wall resting on his neighbor's
land. It would appear, therefore, that support is
an essential characteristic of the structure, and that
the use must coniform to this purpose. One can-
not insert a window in a wall, for instance, if his
neighbor protests. The Massachusetts case of Xor-
mile vs. Gill, 1893; 34 X. K. 543, held that the
neighbor had a right to object to a window in the
wall, even if he were not yet using that portion of
the wall for support. While this may appear a
strict construction of the rule, yet there are other
cases holding that such a neighbor could brick up
the opening by "self-help", limited only by the re-
striction that the work should be so done as not
to injure the other party.
A Minnesota case of 1904, Johnson vs. Minn.
Tribune Company, 98 X. \V. 321, is also a nice ex-
ample of the cross-easement doctrine. The facts in
that case established that one party desired to carry
the street facing material of his building complete-
The Law Club
Arch
ly across the street end of the party wall, and it was
held that his easement on his neighbor's land was
for the right of support, and ejectment would lie
to prevent him from entering on his neighbor's
land. The English doctrine of "tenancy in com-
mon" would probably have to set up some legal
fiction to handle this type problem.
A recent Chicago case, Wert vs. J. R. Thompson
Co., 234 III. A 458, illustrates a situation where the
wall is not only restricted to the specific use of
support, but the very nature of the support cannot
be changed to the detriment of the other party.
The total aggregate load on the party wall was re-
duced from 188.000 Ibs. to 183,000 Ibs., when one
of the neighbors tore down his building and erected
a new one. But the floor levels were changed and
the load distributions were so altered that one sec-
tion of the wall had its load increased from 45,500
Ibs. to 99,000 Ibs. The court held that this change
in the use of the wall was sufficient grounds for
complaint.
Justice Thomas M. Cooley, Chief Justice of
Michigan (and a fonner Dean of the University of
Michigan Law School) decided a Saginaw case in
1885 based strictly upon the proper use of party
walls. In that case, Feige vs. First National Bank.
24 X. W. 772. it developed that a furniture ware-
house was erected in 1872. with a party wall; and
that the neighbor, a bank, constructed a new build-
ing using the same wall. Subsequently, settling of
the bank's walls caused considerable injuries to the

JACK BEECHLER
IT IS sad that the original authorities did not
locate the University of Michigan in the far
western part of the state, to that the end that
we lesser mortals would not have to spend four
years listening to the ravings of a large Detroit con-
tingent over the virtues and achievements of their
particular high schools. This pernicious ailment
would seem, at present, to be most violent in the
Northwestern alumni,—hence it was with the great-
est pleasure that we learned that Jack Beechler did
his time at Southeastern, and has been correspond-
ingly quiet about the matter. That alone should
stamp him as a man of giant moral character and
what not, mostly the latter.
To prove his versatility, however, Jack proceeded
to make Phi Eta Sigma his freshman year, and then
refused to let success make his giddy. Hence his
election to Tau Beta Pi last year, and his present
office of vice-president of that organization.
In the meantime he found himself class secretary
during his junior year, and this past fall he swept
into the senior class presidency by a virtual land-
slide—all of which doubtless accounts for his elec-
tion to Triangles and Vulcans, honorary societies, at
the appropriate moment. Even here his complex
for holding office assured him that the vice-presi-
dency of the latter body. He is also an ex-officio
member of the Engineering Council.
Jack is prospecting for his degree of B.S. in M.E.
and there seems to be no possibility of keeping him
from it this coming June. He also serves in the ca-
pacity of student assistant to Prof. Sherzer, with
hydraulic machinery as his especial forte.
Of late Jack has been looking rather sad and al-
together badly, as though he were laboring under
some acute stress. In an attempt to psycho-analyze
him, it came to light that last semester he fell down
and got a C in Economics 53. That was horrible
enough, but when such recognized stupids as ye ed.
can raise an A in the said course, then indeed can
it be said that our educational system is tottering
and the very ground rocks under our feet.
Jack is a very nice boy, so surely our readers will
be appropriately sympathetic and refrain from
bringing up the painful subject in his presence. We
can only suggest that another all-A semester will
wipe out the stigma.
FRED BUCHAN
FRED Buchan will probably go down in the his-
tory of the class of '32E as the perennial can-
didate for office. We seem to recall Fred as
being nominated for practically every elective posi-
tion possible during his freshman and sophomore-
years, which was a very happy fact as the ultimate
victors always felt as thought they had met with
very sterling opposition. This should not consti-
tute a reflection on our young man, for the fre-
quency of these excursions into Politics may of
course be a trifle exaggerated.
Time will tell, however, and Fred found himself,
in the course of events, chairman of the Soph Prom.
(The reader will here conjure up a picture of an ex-
cessively starched boiled shirt and swallowtails.)
It is said that many a fair maid pined away because
she was not asked to accompany the Grand March
with Freddie, but more about
that later.
Despite the fact that he has
heard the pitiful story of the
young bridge builder who lost
track of his decimal point.
Fred remains unshaken in his
conviction that he was cut out
to be a civil engineer. Wit-

OUR ALUMNI
PROFESSOR CLYDE E. WILSON
IT IS with no little pleasure that we are able,
in this month's issue of the Teclniic, to informal-
ly introduce to our readers Prof. Clyde E. Wil-
son of the Mechanical Engineering department.
Professor Wilson is yet another member of the
faculty whose familiarity with the University ex-
tends back before his college days, as he is a "local
son". Graduating from the Ann Arbor public
schools, he entered the Engineering College and
secured the degree of B.S. in M.E. in 1905, prefa-
tory to spending eight years in high' school teach-
ing. It is interesting to note that during this pe-
riod he made an excursion into the field of coach-
ing track teams, with eminently successful results,
and he also did educational work at Cornell Uni-
versity in 1911.
In 1913 he returned to the University of Michi-
gan in the capacity of instructor in Mechanical En-
gineering. His promotion was remarkably rapid
thereafter, and he attained his present rank of full
professor in 1917, this same year also receiving his
degree of M.S. in M.E.
Professor Wilson's interests in the University
have been by no means confined to the mere
routine of teaching. During the World War, for
example, he sponsored the
liberty Loan drives among
the students, was command-
ant of the engineering stu-
dents training company, gave
courses in military training,
and was commissioned as a
major, although he did not
see service overseas. He has
been intimately associated
with the development of the
Mentor and Honor Systems
in the Engineering College,
besides serving on many and
varied University committees,
which lack of space prevents

us from enumerating in detail as we would like to.
Teaching, to him, is a love as well as a profes-
sion because of the contact that it gives him with
students; and this desire to help, besides instruct,
has won him a reciprocal loyalty in many of the
men who have taken his courses. A further re-
flection of his enthusiasm and good nature can be
seen in his great fondness for out-door games and
athletics. An expert rifleman, he has frequently
been on the state rifle team in the past, and he plays
a fairly good game of golf.
Professionally he has done a limited amount of
consulting work, notably on the Liberty Engine for
the government, and work for the \\ estinghoust
Electric and Manufacturing Co. He has also found
time to do a considerable amount of research work
in connection with his duties in the College.
Professor \Vilson's societies include the Amer-
ican Society of Mechanical Engineers, the Michigan
Engineering Society, The University Club, Masonic
Lodge and a number of others.
WILLARD H. DOW
TH E remarkable progress of Willard II.
Dow, '19E, who has only recently succeeded
his late father to the Presidency and Gen-
eral Managership of the Dow Chemical Company,
may well enable him to add his name to the roster
of prominent University of Michigan engineering
graduates.
Upon receiving his degree in Chemical Engi-
neering, he entered his father's plant at Midland.
Michigan, as a plant operator. His rapid rise to
his present executive position was accomplished by
dint of hard labor and outstanding brilliance in su-
pervising and expanding his father's policies and
organization. In 1928, his diligence was rewarded
by his being appointed to the combined office of
General Manager and Assistant Treasurer—a posi-
tion which he held until the death of his father in
1930. Since then, Mr. Dow has successfully tilled
the executive position which his father vacated.
Mr. Dow's activities are by no means restricted to
the Dow Chemical Company, as he is also Vice-
President and Director of the Midland Ammonia

A mass of brick, mortar,
and steel piercing
the sky
FOR the past three decades a period of rapid
transition, together with tremendous progress
of Engineering have been responsible for
those new masses of masonry, steel and glass which
nowr make our Architectural horizon a crazy sil-
houette against the sky. I am thinking especially
of that ludicrous trilogy of buildings expressing
with triple force, because of their ironical proxim-
ity to one another, and crying out in a triolet of
shame the disastrous plight of Architecture in
American civilization, namely the Wrigley Build
ing with its glazed surface, resembling so many
bathrooms turned inside out along with its birthday
cake Gothicism,—the Tribune Tower with its false
buttresses and mal-appropriate ecclesiasticism, and
the Medinah Athletic Club surmounted at 490 feet
by a Moorish dome and an equally absurd Minaret.
These structures have their counter-part in so-
called in o d e r n i s t i c Architecture, motivated to
greater heights by increased land values and the
race to become the world's tallest structure, failing
in the latter only because the super-structure, the
steel skeleton of one is already several stories above
the tallest before plastered walls are dry. These
are usually set-back affairs, reaching a sky punctur-
ing pinnacle, and all out of scale with humanity.
Their vertically is in opposition to the natural de-
sire of freedom, expansion and of living.
Wre shall say no more about American's canons
of taste, or of the Architects (?) who conceive of
such structures, and permit them to be built; our
chief concern is for the students born under the
shadow of these monstrosities. To what principles
will they dedicate themselves when the people, for
whom they must one day practice as Architects, be-
lieve the Collegiate Gothicism of our Universities,
the awesome vertically and the empty modernistic-
ism of our skyscrapers and the picturesque ro-
manticism of their dwellings is the quintessence of
culture and refinement?
Where is there one good healthy inspiration for

them in the new neurotic deleria of the present?
There are a few men in Architecture who have pre-
served those principles and that spirit which make
for a great Art of a great Nation, and it is to them
that we must look for the formation of our Ideals.
This involves a rational analysis of social and eco-
nomic processes which control our civilization.
Architecture cannot exist independently even of the
smallest life process. The Motor Car, City Plan-
ning, Society, Industry, Production, Distribution,
and Marketing, and above all MAN in his relation
to the social order; all are factors which are vital in
establishing and humanizing Architecture with civi-
liztion. This means a gradual revamping of the
entire order of things, taken as parts, in relation to
the unified whole. The student of Architecture
then, becomes a keen student of the Life of Human
Beings as well as a student of the technique of his
Art.
All great Art rises out of great spirituality in
one form or another. What greater spirituality can
more inspire Art than that which strives to attain
the fullest measure of ultimate good and beauty for
MAN? Yes, Young Man in Architecture, we have
much to do for civilization. We must again find
the earth, living, pulsating with a tremendous force.
We must ally to it our structures; they must re-
flect and confess their origin, their kinship, not to
the machine, but to it. We must master our ad-
vantage. We must understand it too, so we may
exploit its infinite possibilities. We must live in-
tensely, be accutely sensitive, persevere awarely.
for on our shoulders falls the tremendous task of
teaching, humanizing and reconstructing.
Upon our profession at the present time rests the
responsibilities of our Nation's Culture. Decadence
in Art precedes the downfall of civilization. As-
piration and Dedication to those principles and that
spirit in which great beauty is created is the same
basic force that holds civilizations together. God
has provided us with beauty in materials; Engi-
neers have provided us with limitless power; MAN
has provided us with infinite problems; hence it re-
mains for us to provide ourselves with fine sensi-
tivity to the correlation of these forces, for the
good of MAN, and the progress of civilization in
the cause of Architecture.

A New Staff
Once a year the Michigan Technic has instilled
into its veins (if such an old and staid publication
may have veins) some new blood. A new staff
brings to the magazine an infusion of new ideas
with which to compensate in some degree for its
lack of experience. This system has been in vogue
throughout the fifty years of the Technic's life and
has brought it from the paper it was at that time
to the modern and up to date publication which you
now read.
To run on a sound financial basis is of course
necessary and important even in these time of de-
pression. As a result and against the wishes of
every member of the staff, the publication has been
made small enough to balance the limited amount
of advertising we are able to secure. However, as
soon as we are able to do so, we shall enlarge the
magazine to its former size.
With our entrance to the publication board, one
of the most progressive staffs in the history of the
magazine retires. Radical changes in the design
and in business policies have raised the quality of
this publication in the past year. To Baze Johnson,
Dave Hannah, and Jack Spencer we offer the very
just and due praise for their efforts last year. And,
too, we, the new publication board, pledge to carry
on to the best of our ability, using the good founda-
tion which has been given to us plus the new ideas,
in order that the Michigan Technic can still pro-
gress in its own way.
The Technic's Platform for the U. of M.
The other day one of the staff members with a
sense of humor, realizing that a new staff was tak-
ing its places for the first time in this issue, placed
the following list on the editor's desk. While the
editor feels that the editorial page is not the place
for a humor section, still he finds in this list of
items, hidden under the bantering tone, so many
ideas which may prove food for thought that he
felt that it should be printed.
1. Push East Hall over before it falls over.
2. Make interfraternity council meetings some-
thing besides overgrown bull-sessions.
3. Have it rain on campus only every other
day, instead of every day.
4. Make the Union showers produce warm
water instead of liquid ice when the indicator points
to warm.
5. Find out why, even though the library has
1.234,567,890 volumes, it never has on hand the one
you ask for.
6. Build the subway now.
( N'ope, that's out, we don't need a subway.)
7. Hang, draw, and quarter the dopes who
rustle around five minutes before a lecture is over.
8. Provide better looking girls for the amateur
surveyors to scan through their telescopes.
9. Remove the chemistry side-shelf from Ann
Arbor's drinking water.
10. Form a class for those dogs who are so in-
tent on learning, that they infest the class-rooms.
11. Have some of the instructors we know, teach
them.
12. Have the B. &amp; G. Boys vary their routine
by filling up the holes before they dig them.
The Universal Poison Gas
The deadlines of that unwitting murderer, car-
bon monoxide, has been long known but only re-
cently has come to be of very great significance.
The modern industrial era, built so extensively
around power as derived from fuel combustion, has
provided man with the automobile, furnace gases,
and other sources of destructive gases. Thus a boon
to mankind has also brought with it a means of
wreaking toll on those who presume to enjoy its
benefits. The death rate of carbon monoxide poi-
soning has risen steadily as the years have brought
a corresponding rise in the production of automo-
tive equipment for the enjoyment and utility of the
general public. The result has been an influx of
preventative measures to succor the unknowing
populace.
Only recently has definite action been taken in
this direction and we owe it to the United States
Bureau of Mines that the menace is at least under
controlled experimentation wit ha view of elimi-
nating its ravages.
This novel method of attack is embodied in a
new motion picture "Carbon Monoxide, the Unseen
Danger". Since the circulation of the film was
started, it has been shown before audiences totaling
more than 1,550,000 people. The visualization of
the hazards of this deadly gas, which presents a real
danger to everyone has helped greatly to conserve
life by keeping vividly in the minds of the audiences
the lurking peril in a gasoline motor.
We are certainly viewing an interesting develop-
ment which shows every chance for success. Kv-
'•ryone should be interested in a matter which can
prove such a distinct contribution to the welfare of
humanitv if solved.

HERE'S THE NEWS—
Stand-by Mr. Alumnus:
It is again time to tune in on the Technic radio.
The evening is crisp and clear and we expect it to
pick up some distance. Incidentally the radio is
new and we intend to make note of the dial reading
of every station regardless of its distance or impor-
tance. However we know that all of you will be
eager to hear of our results so here we go. A •_••«•
seconds for the tubes to warm up, a little grumble
from the short wave stations at the bottom of the
dial and the first station we pick up is way back in—-
1900
George E. Haggas is announcing the fact that he
is with the Cumberland County Tower and Uighl
Company as Assistant General Manager. He re--
sides at 540 Brighton Avenue, Woodford Station,
Portland, Maine.
1903
The next voice we hear is that of William F.
Temple at 1281 Bonnie View Avenue, Lakewood,
Ohio. Besides being the Northern Ohio representa-
tive of the Hoover Steel Ball Company of Ann Ar-
bor, he has been very active in the Triennial of
University of Michigan Clubs held in Cleveland.
1904
After a little tuning, a station from Butte, Mon-
tana sends its welcome wave roaring through the
speaker of our set. It say that John R. Bartlett is
the Assistant General Superintendent of Mines in
the Anaconda Copper Min-
ing Company. He can be
reached by mail at I'. ().
Box 1357.
Grant D. Bradshaw's sta-
tion is in close proximity
with the same wave length
as the last in spite of the
fact that it comes from 186
Beaver Street, Beaver, 1'a.
The announc'-ment is that
he is President of Bradshaw
&amp; Company, 530 4th Ave-
nue, Pittsburgh, Pa.
With a twist of the dial
St. Louis, Missouri gives us
a scrap of interesting gossip
concerning Earl A. Forkner.
He is Assistant Manager of the motor sales division
of the Wagner Klectric Company.
1907
Our lively Chicago Broadcast, elaborates the rise
of Charles John Whipple, from a stock clerk with
llibbard. Spencer, Bartlett &amp; Company to the
presidency of one of Chicago's largest hardware
distributing firms. Mr. Whipple does not only
share the activities on behalf of his firm, but gives
much of his time and attention as Director of the
Chicago Railways Company and the National
Bank of Woodlawn. During the war he served as
Personnel Supervisor of all military establishments
of the Central West.
1909
Dialing over a bit we come to a local station in
which much stress is given to the activities of the
General Agent for the Medical Protection Com-
pany, who we find is Adolph G. Schulz, located on
8738 Dexter Blvd., Detroit.
1910
Picking up Virginia we meet Alexander D.
Surles, who, after studying engineering at Michi-
gan, attended West Point, and is now Major in the
Cavalry at Fort Myer. Mr. Surles is married and
has two sons.
1912
We dial hastily over to
Washington, D. C.. where
we pick up a rousing an-
nouncement of the engage-
ment of Hamilton W. Lewis
to Gertrude L. Harshaw of
Grove City, Pennsylvania.
The date of the wedding,
however, was not given.
Then from Washington
we are given the news of the
illness of Mark F. Finley,

—and that's what the
statistician does for industry
Definite knowledge of "where we are" and
"what lies ahead" is as vital in business as in
flying. For this expert navigating, the Bell
System has long relied upon statisticians.
These men study present and prospective
industrial, economic and social conditions in
all parts of the country. They gather facts-
analyze them, correlate them, discover their
significance to the telephone business, draw
guidance from them. They study and fore-
cast the changing requirements of the public
for telephone service. They estimate the
probable future demand for new services,
such as radio telephony to foreign lands and
ships at sea. They keep the executives advised
as to current progress towards the objectives
thus carefully determined.
Only by plotting a course scientifically can
the Bell System continue to develop along
sound lines.

furniture warehouse, and an issue of fact was raised
whether the injury was due to defective vault foun-
dations, or wall support. In returning the case to
the lower court. Chief Justice Cooley stated that
the jury findings should be governed by the law that
the Bank was restricted to a non-injurious use of
the party wall. This case is rather clear and ap-
pears to be an equitable status for the law.
An issue was raised in Hayes vs. Arcade Realty
Co. 1917, 257 Pa. 566, based upon the Act of 1855.
This early act permitted foundations to be extended
ten inches on a neighbor's lot. In the present case
the footing had been spread out eighteen and one-
half inches, but the court ruled that the underpin-
ning was a reasonable design, as ten inches of this
particular kind of ground could not properly sup-
port the load, in spite of the utilization of heavy
steel girders. In other words the court used some
common sense in interpreting the legislative intent.
Alterations to Existing Walls
The rights and liabilities of neighboring lot own-
ers is frequently brought into conflict when it is
necessary to alter or repair an existing wall. If the
parties have a specific contract or grant regarding a
party wall it may be long since antiquated. Thus,

dead, with new owners holding the property for en-
tirely different purposes than their predecessors.
If there is no written agreement regarding the
part}' wall, the situation is even more difficult. In
framing the law on this matter the desirability of
repair or improvement of existing old walls must be
considered, together with the question of who is to
pay the cost of construction and the third question
of how the parties' rights will be affected by the
proposed construction. It is a difficult problem, and
one frequently associated with heavy expenditures.
There are a few basic principles which must be
clear.
1. If one owner is through using a party wall he
can't arbitrarily take down the half of the wall on
his land. This would be a violation of the cross-
easement interest which his neighbor has in the
wall.
2. If the wall proves insufficient for Smith's
purposes, he can build a newer and larger wall to
meet the demands of his new building. This is in
the interest of civic development in the community.
3. If Smith desires to take down an existing wall
and erect a better wall, he must meet all of the costs
thereto, including any damages to his neighbor.
4. If the neighbor desires to avail himself later
of the improvements which the new wall possesses,
such as capacity to carry a greater load than for-
merly, Smith must be reimbursed for the benefit
conferred.
5. If a well becomes in need of repair so badly
that replacement is necessary, in whole or in part,
either party may repair the dangerous wall, but he
acts at his own peril of proving by expert testimony
that such work was in fact necessary.
6. Accidentally destroyed walls are in the class
of dangerous walls, if there is no inconsistent agree-
ment.
In Wallis vs. First National Bank, a Wisconsin
case of 1913, 143 N. W. 670, it was lield that the
bank could raise their party wall, provided the re-
sulting party wall was sufficiently strong so as not
to injure Wallis. This decision was made in spite
of the protest of Wallis.
The Virginian case of Bellenot vs. Laube, 52 S.
K. 698, is another situation involving the raising of
a party wall, but it caused some additional issues.
Bellenot wanted to tear down an existing wall,
claiming it was dangerous. This was a matter of
fact, the court said, to be decided upon the basis of
expert testimony. The burden of proof rested
with Bellenot to establish that the old building was
dangerous. Mis real purpose was to replace his old
house with a new two story building, with the
ground floor for store use, and a large hall above.
Laube had the privilege, however, of using the extra
height if he so desired.
Brooks vs. Curtis, 50 X. Y. 639, is a case of 1873
where it was held that the foundations of a party
wall could be lowered on the basis that the height
of a wall could be increased. The court quoted
with approval the earlier case of Eno vs. Del
Yecchio.
The matter of the increase of the thickness of the
party wall was at issue in the Massachusetts case of
Walker vs. Stetson, 38 N. E. 18, where Walker had
increased the wall on his own land. It was held
that if this were for Walker's sole benefit, he alone
should meet the cost of construction, but that if
Stetson had participated in the benefit, he should
conribute to the cost.
The law on the various types of alterations of
Party Walls is quite consistent, and so establishes
the relationship between two neighbors that either
party may improve his property without unneces-
sary restrictions, and yet his neighbor will be amply
protected in his long established rights. o

Fred hails from Rochester, N. Y., and had no
good reason for not attending the local university,
—that is, he could not think of one. We must look
at these naive confessions as subtly flattering his
Alma Mater, which really is a mighty nice place,
but then we are digressing and the reader can re-
refer to the University's advertisement in the front
of the magazine.
It was with mild surprise that we learned of
Fred's marriage during the Christmas holidays,

proof against such lesser shocks. It seems that
Fred was spending all his time in writing letters
and his money in long distance telephone calls,

Principles and Development of the Autogyro" and
James B. Robertson, 32 Marine, presented a paper
on "Marine Diesel Power Plants". The spon-
taneoues discussion which followed these talks is
characteristic of the live interest accorded to all of
these programs.
Plans for this semester include more meetings
of this kind as well as talks by practicing engineers.

which point a partial vacuum
exists. Thus both a pressure
and a vacuum help to drive
water through the system,
and the faster the propeller
turns, the larger the flow of
fresh, c o o 1 \v a t e r. Since
there are no moving parts or
small passageways to be-
come stuck or clogged, the
motor can be operated even
in muddy rivers.
Perhaps the greatest sin-
gle factor in the progress of
the outboard motor is full
pivot steering. The value
of this feature is immeas-
urable. It permits com-
plete maneuverability in any
and every direction with-
out stopping the motor. It makes possible quick
turns, instant reverse, and fastest possible stopping
when used as a brake.
The rotary valve is a fine example of wide-awake
engineering. By its use the full piston displacement
is made effective for power production. The valve
itself consists of a set of gears, a hollow rotor, and
a housing. The gas and air mixture from the car-
bureter enters through the bottom of the hollow
rotor which is being revolved at crankshaft speed
by the gears. A port in the side of the rotor coin-
cides with a similar opening in the crankcase, al-
lowing the fresh charge to be drawn through by the
low pressure in the case. The valve is so timed that
a full charge will be drawn in before the opening
is cut off. The rotary valve has been a big factor
in the production of high power with small en-
gines.
A still further successful advance in design that
has added much to the joy and convenience to be
derived from the outboard is alternate firing, in
which the cylinders fire alternately instead of si-
multaneously, producing two impulses instead of
one as heretofore. In this set-up the two cylinders
are cast "en bloc," but each has its own separate
crankcase for compressing the charge, and its own
ignition coil and breaker. The crankshaft is of the
three bearing type with a bored enlarged center
bearing for admitting the mixture of gas and air
to the crankcases at the proper time. Because
there are two power impulses per revolution, the
necessary carbureter, muffler, and flywheel capacity
are greatly reduced. With alternate firing, smooth-
ness of power flow is increased 100% and vibration
is cut to a minimum. This change results in an im-
proved performance that is as noticeable as the dif-
ference between an eight cylinder automobile and a
four.
The introduction of electric starting represents n
step forward to outboard comfort and convenience.
With this feature the motor can be placed under a
hatch, out of sight. The controls, including choke,
throttle, spark, and starter, may then be mounted
on a panel before the driver the same as they would
be in a modern automobile. Electric starting af-
fords the utmost in ease, simplicity of operation and
certainty of starting.
The method of installation of the starter is most
ingenious. Instead of adding a starter and sepa-
rate generator, the two have been combined and
mounted in place of the fly\vheel. _ In this way the
weight has been kept down and the appearance has
not been marred in the least. The unit consists of
a stationary field, an armature (which is also the
flywheel of the motor), and a brush assembly. The
breakers for the ignition system are placed above
the brushes.
These and many other lesser features of super-
iority, representing the highest type of human
achievement and immeasurable engineering skill,
are responsible for the revolutionary advancement
of the outboard motor. We add our praises to an
up and coming industry.

SEALING STEEL
WITH FLUID COPPER
WITH copper melted to the consist-
ency of kerosene in an electric
furnace, steel can be sealed so as to be
gas-tight. Like bones, the grains of steel
tend to grow together slowly, but elec-
tric heat speeds up the process so that
steel joints require but a few minutes to
knit. And steel joints knit in a copper-
brazing furnace are exceptionally neat,
strong, and tight.
As a controlled atmosphere at very high
temperature must be used, the electric
furnace is important to the process. At
brazing temperature, the molten copper
wets the clean steel and flows into the
finest crevices, forming a copper-steel
alloy which seals the joint. The greater
the pressure at the joint, the readier the
flow of copper.
Such furnaces are used in the manufacture
of G-E refrigerators, where hundreds
of evaporators are hermetically sealed
daily.
These developments in industrial heating
are largely the achievements of college-
trained General Electric engineers.
Newly graduated young men obtain in
the Testing Department practical experi-
ence which fits them for future positions
of responsibility.

TO WELD
ON 15 major pipe lines com-
pleted in East Texas, 50 per
cent, of the total oxy-acetylene
welded mileage is Lindewelded.
Why, in scarcely more than a
year, has this new method of oxy-
acetylene welding been adopted
by leading pipe line builders in
every part of the country?
The answer is: Because it saves
from 30 to 60 per cent, of the time
required by ordinary methods of
welding.
Because it reduces welding mate-
rial consumption 3 5 to 40 per cent.
Because it produce? stronger
and more ductile joints.
Lindewelding can be done with
ordinary blowpipes or with special
apparatus which makes welding
almost automatic and further in-
creases its speed.
Several valuable and interesting
technical booklets describing the
application of the oxy-acetylene
process of welding and cutting in
design, construction and fabrica-
tion are available. Tomorrow's
engineers will be expected to
know how to apply this modern
metal-working process. Write us
if you are interested.
detaifaof-Juu
Lindewelding technique differs from
neutral flame welding technique in that it
employs a special rod, a special flame ad-
justment, and the "backhand" method of
blowpipe manipulation. The actual steps
in making a Lindewelded joint are shown
in our motion picture, "The Lindeweld
Process for Pipe Line Construction."This
will be loaned free of charge to schools,
pipe line officials and welding or engi-
neering societies. It is furnished in 16 mm.

An autogyro at rest.
IS the solution of a world wide aeronautical prob-
lem looking toward fulfillment in the recent
vast exploitation and development of the
Autogiro, man's newborn babe of the sky wastes?
The most sanguine predictions of Autogiro manu-
facturers have seemed to be satisfactorily substan-
tiated by many recent experimental successes and
bits of sensational accomplishment which have
startled the public to the point of intense interest
more readily than have any of the other recent
aeronautical forecasts. And yet the world is still
full of doubters. There are many who fail to see
anything of practical utility in the "flying wind-
mill" and base their assumptions on apparently
well chosen figures. Both the pro and con of the
argument have been taken up by the press and the
shower of contention has failed to prove anything
very definitely. A very brief review of the present
situation with respect to the 'giro seems to be in
order as well as some sort of a non-technical dis-
cussion of the operation of such a new and curious
piece of machinery, so incomprehensible to the ordi-
nary layman.
To bring out clearly the marvelous possibilities
of this new machine let us move for an instant to
the foot of the roofless pier at the end of Spring
Street, New York City. Juan de La Cierva, who
invented the "whirling dervish of airplanes" in 1923,
lias just landed in this country on one of his peren-
nial visits. A hovering autogiro points its nose into
a strong west wind and begins to settle down ver-
tically. A landing is made on the concrete floor
of the dock, the plane rolls only about ten feet,
the distinguished passenger climbs aboard, and the
machine takes off again after about twenty feet of
runway. It seems to answer the question of city
landing fields and points out unnumbered possibili-
ties for the future employment of such advantages,
the most important of which may be the develop-
ment of aero bus systems to transfer passengers
from the heart of the metropolis to the outlying
air terminals. By doing away with landing fields,
we eliminate the worst inconvenience to air travel;
there certainly appears to be a future here!
There are several very important factors, on the
other hand, which have seemed to boil down the
present sales field of the autogiro to the sporting
use of the private owner, novelty and advertising
effects, and the possibility of various passenger
services. The first thing that aeronautical critics
always point out is the inherent inefficiency of the
machine in carrying freight loads. The aspect ratio
of this type of craft, technically the ratio of span
to length of wing chord, can never be increased
beyond one, while that of an ordinary wing plane
is now often as high as six. Since the induced drag
and pay load efficiency depend on this factor, it is
claimed that the autogiro can never compete with
the airplane for freight uses. Added to this is the
fact that an autogiro sells for $15,000 as against
$11,000 for an airplane of similar size, or $1,500
for an airplane of similar load carrying capacity.
On the other side of the balance we have the
great safety of the machine and its extraordinary
ease of handling. Comfort in riding is also en-
hanced since the autogiro eliminates the bumping
of air pockets. The inherent stability, slow landing
speed, and quick take off are decidedly in favor of
the autogiro and are qualities which the average
man has difficulty in mastering in an ordinary plane.
Hence the wide field which is opening up for this
machine lies in the realm of private ownership at
the present time.
The autogiros at present arc all very similar in

&gt;-ize and design. A description of the Detroit News
Autogiro (shown in the frontispiece) covers the
general characteristics very well.
It is powered with a 300 horsepower Wright J-6
motor, flies at a top speed of 123 miles per hour,
rjid carries two passengers in the front cockpit with
the pilot in the rear cockpit. The diameter of the
rotor is forty-five feet. There are four blades.
Each blade has one spar made of three pieces of
chrome nickel tubing, telescoped, welded, and riv-
eted together. This gives high tensile strength and
flexibility. Birch ribs fastened to steel collars are
slipped on the spars and welded in place. These
ribs are covered with fabric and doped similar to
regulation aircraft construction.
The blades are fitted to the centerpost with
hinges that allow for the vertical motion at the
tips. The blades can also go back and forth a
few degrees in the plane of rotation to help even-
out the air flow. Their action in this direction is
restricted by interbracing cables.
The stub wings are primarily to carry the ailerons
for lateral control. The fuselage is the same as
any standard airplane fuselage except for the under-
carriage and tail. The tail is long instead of high
so that the blades will clear it when they droop
and come to rest. The undercarriage is especially
wide in its tread and is braced to stand vertical
landings.
An explanation of the principle that enables an
autogiro to fly is rather difficult. The theory and
its various derivations are still very much inclined
to be hearsay. However, the autogiro is not incor-
essentially a windmill with hinged blades. The
blades are pivoted on the centerpost so that they
have a vertical motion at the tips. These rotors
are in no way connected with the motor while in
flight, but derive all of their motion from natural
atmospheric forces. As they spin furiously about
the centerpost, they have a centrifugal force along
their lengths which usually becomes as high as
three tons in magnitude. This force is all that
prevents the blades from pointing straight up like
an inside-out umbrella. The blade that is going
into the wind in the same direction as the airplane
itself has an increased relative velocity which tends
to bring the lift to a maximum and elevate the
rotor. As the blade thus rises, the relative wind
velocity becomes downward and the angle of attack
is decreased, which in turn decreases the lift and
allows the blade to drop. By this time the blade
is well around on the other side of its revolution
and is subtracting its velocity from that of the air-
plane. This lowered relative velocity would ordi-
narily have a tendency for the blade to lose its lift
and allow that side of the autogiro to drop down.
But, as the blade goes down, the forces of the wind
are upward, which increases the angle of attack ami
consequently the lift and offsets the loss of lift clue
to this decrease in velocity. This "flapping" of the
blades, as it is called, is really the secret of the
success of this machine. In all, the vertical travel
of the blades is only a few degrees.
At certain positions of the blade, the resultant
air force is ahead of the perpendicular which causes
the blades to autorotate. It is this same condition
of air forces that causes an ordinary airplane to go
into the very dangerous "tail spin".
The unseen but omnipresent centrifugal force
supports the autogiro much the same as the piers
and cables of a suspension bridge support the road-
way. The plane itself is a virtual pendulum, a
condition which makes it very stable and its design
the most essentially safe that has ever been devel-
oped.
The latest autogiros have a drive shaft from the
motor which is geared to the rotor. The rotor is
revolved to proper starting speed for taking off
only. There is also a brake drum on the rotor
with which to stop the blades after landing.
By using the motor to start the blades rotating,
if there is a twenty-mile wind blowing, the 'giro
will take off immediately upon opening wide the
throttle. With no wind, about a one hundred foot
run is necessary.
It is possible to glide to a normal landing at
about 20 miles per hour. By pulling the stick well
back and stopping the engine it is easy to settle

Private Property
By Prof. WALTER C. SADLER
The Lawyers' Club through
the arch
AT first blush it might appear that the law
governing the property rights of a fee sim-
ple land owner is in conflict and confusion.
From time immemorial it has been quoted that a
land owner has property rights from the center of
the earth to the sky. In other words, this very
ancient doctrine would imply unrestricted use of
the air above, the surface upon which we walk, and
the ground which lies below the surface. The strict
enforcement of such a doctrine would be inflexible,
and, in fact, most undesirable in our modern form
of civilization. So we find the rule being narrowed
down. The state enters under the right of Eminent
Domain to take away the very title of a tract from
a landowner for a highway or a railroad. And
today the reasonably operated airplane may pass
over the land at will. In fact, even the transferring
of the ownership of his land is closely restricted,
with the control of the will limited to a relatively
few years after the death of this owner. And so
a cursory examination will indicate that a fee
simple title, the greatest and fullest possible owner-
ship of realty, is distinctly restricted in the rights
it vests in the landowner.
These preceding restrictions appear to be of a
general nature, developed for the protection of the
public as a whole. But examination will disclose
that our landowner is even further restricted in the
use of his land. His next-door neighbor, for in-
stance, may so act as to cause him considerable
loss without any legal means for recovery in money
damages. These situations may arise from the
peculiar way in which the neighbor used his land.
Take the hypothetical case of Smith vs. Miller,
neighbors, where Smith is asking relief or money
damages due to the way Miller has used his land.
It is clear Smith could not recover in any of the
following situations:
1. Miller builds a snowfence so that the resulting
drifts on Smith's land are unusually deep.
2. Miller rents his property to a respectable fam-
ily of foreign extraction with the result that
the rent from Smith's property takes a sharp
drop.
3. Miller erects a building on his land so that
surface rain water which formerly flowed from
Smith's land across Miller's land to the river,
now accumulates on Smith's property in a
stagnant pond.
4. Miller erects buildings on his property in a
normal, reasonable way, but the noise and dust
of construction makes Smith's property unrent-
able for months.
5. Miller plants trees whose heavy shade kills
Smith's grass.
These few examples indicate the field of personal
loss sufferable by a landowner from the intrusions
by outsiders on his supposedly inviolable rights as
a fee simple property owner.
It is well to consider a different aspect of the
situation, where the landowner is interested in what
restrictions are placed upon his personal use of his
own land. Certainly he should not be able to use
his land so negligently as to injure others, nor
should he be permitted to create a nuisance thereon
to the annoyance of his fellow men. A malicious
use of his land should also be prohibited. Turning
to the cases we find situations illustrative of these
points. A city builds a reservoir so negligently
that the concrete wall gives way, to the great de-
struction of neighboring property. A railroad builds
a bridge so negligently that the river is diverted
from its normal channel and overflows adjacent
farms. A copper smelter so operates its factory
that poisonous chemicals are deposited on nearby
vegetation, the nuisance resulting in great damages
to plant life and farm operations. A boiler fac-
tory so operates its machinery that the noise is a
nuisance, or a packing house with its disagreeable
odors is started in a residential district. Finally,
an irritated farmer maliciously starts a fire on his
own land knowing full well "that the sparks will
ignite his neighbor's woods. In every one of these
cases the landowner has confined his activities to

his own property, and yet in each case such un-
warranted use of his own property must be for-
bidden. The status of this branch of the law seems
to have been well established down through the
ages, and its resulting effects are fully consistent
with public welfare.
Therefore, we see that a landowner is restricted
to the reasonable use of his property. Furthermore,
a landowner cannot complain if his neighbor rea-
sonably uses the adjoining land, even though such
use results in his injury. It would necessarily ap-
pear then, that the measurement of property rights
of a fee simple holder of realty is, "reasonable use";
a use reasonable both as to the owner and as to
the public. Such a test may aid in solving some
of the complicated relationships arising in lateral
support.
The common law doctrine of lateral support re-
quired that a landowner should not so use his
ground as to disturb the natural state of his neigh-
bor's land. For instance, a landowner could not
excavate a pit on his land so that his neighbor's land
would become unstable and cave away. The rule
nppears absolute, the law looking to the property
right intruded, not to the extent of the resulting
injury. In short, our landowner must use his prop-
erty in a reasonable manner, and such an open
excavation would not be reasonable because it re-
sults in an intruded property right. Based upon
this doctrine, it is clear that the landowner is not
governed by his intent. It is no defense for him
to set up that he was not negligent, not careless
or indifferent, or not maliciously inclined in his
activities. He is acting at his peril, and is liable
for the result. It is true that he may not be held
for the resulting damage from the misnamed classi-
cation "an act of God", but by very definition such
acts are beyond human control, and are absolutely
independent of the reasonableness of the use of the
property.
The mining engineer is the builder primarily con-
cerned with the lateral support of the ground in
its natural state. It is this class of cases, when
complicated by ground water problems, which give
rise to heavy damage suits. Building operations
in a big city are not so tied up with the natural
state of the ground. If a tall building is erected
beside a vacant lot, the disturbance of the vacant
the other hand, if a structure is subsequently erected
on this vacant lot, the designers have had sufficient
opportunity to learn of the disturbance of the land
in its natural state, and provide accordingly. If
this provision for extra foundations results in extra
cost, to that extent the neighbor should be liable.
But this type of case seldom results in heavy dam-
age suits.
This subject of lateral support, as a branch of
the reasonable use of property, takes on a different
aspect in the case of built-up sections of our modern
cities. The landowner now finds that the adjacent
land is no longer a vacant lot; but property im-
proved with substantial buildings. It is clear that
the natural state of the land has already been dis-
turbed. The reasonableness of use of adjacent prop-
erty, therefore, must be determined by more liberal
tests. In other words, the burden of these build-
ings may of their own weight, so increase the ground
pressure as to be a contributing factor to any
damages resulting from cellar excavation on ad-
jacent lands. Of course, if such is a fact, the old
common law doctrine of "land in its natural state"
cannot apply. This matter of increased ground
pressure is a matter of fact to be determined by
a jury, based upon evidence submitted by founda-
tion experts. The extent of this increase of ground
pressure is absolutely immaterial, and the fact that
there has been an alteration in the natural state of
the ground leads to new standards of reasonable-
ness. The actions of the land owner in excavating
his pit is now limited only by negligence and malice.
What will amount to negligence in the case of
a landowner desiring to excavate up to the propertv
line, but going down deeper with his foundations
than the building on the adjacent lot? Of course,
it will be necessary that some form of underpinning
be used to protect the existing older building.
Which of the two neighbors should stand the cost
of this underpinning, and, more important, who
should carry the burden and responsibility that
there be no resulting settlement of the older build-
ing?
The owner of the older building will feel that he
has made a reasonable use of his land and should
not be annoyed by the subsequent actions of his
neighbor. When confronted with the fact that his
ground is no longer in its natural state, he may be
able to show that his building has stood more than
twenty years, and claim a prescriptive right to the
right of support as it now stands. That is virtually
setting up the theory that the ground is in a "nat-
ural state" now, even if it is different than the
original state of the ground. But the cases will
not support his position. The reasonableness of the
use of the land must also be governed by what will
be reasonable for the neighbor. Certainly a

WE were particularly fortunate to hear that
eminent City-planning Architect, Mr. Henry
Wright, lecture to a group of faculty, stu-
dents, and townspeople, on a subject of vital social,
economic, civic, and architectural significance;
namely that of reclaiming and rehabilitating the
acres of blighted areas in our larger cities. That
such a move is essential to healthful environment,
the present economic situation, and to truly modern
American communities cannot be denied.
Mr. Lewis Mumford has made a thorough anal-
ysis of housing in these blighted areas in which he
points out that the increased number of mechanical
and standardized devices—refrigerators, bath-tubs,
toilets, steam-heating, radio connections—all of
which have led to the industrialization of architec-
ture, now represent ninety per cent of the total cost
of the average dwelling, and that precious little is
left for Architectural Refinement. The result is
distressingly obvious: finding the schemes pre-
sented by the architect prohibitive in cost, the
industrial and clerical workers turned to the car-
penter-contractor, the "jerry-builder" and the in-
evitable cheapening of materials and workmanship;
hence our blighted areas.
The mass-production house turned out by the
machine, designed by a corps of experts, sanitary
engineers, heating engineers, hygienists, and do-
mestic science professors, according to Mr. Mum-
ford, would rationalize the modern house, and in
the place of the charm of good building, of the
mason's or carpenter's feeling for his work, there
would appear the austere clarity of good machinery;
in short it would constitute a real improvement
over the actual quarters in which a great part of
the population now live. In spite of these apparent
advantages, however, the mass-house would not be
a solution to the housing problem because its cost
would not be greatly reduced, and even if it were
cut in half the cost of sewers and sewage disposal,
water mains, rent of land, and streets, would aver-
age in to show a saving of barely ten per cent.
Land, manufactured utilities, site improvements,
and finance call for a greater share of cost than
the building and labor, and the mass-production
house cannot help this. It appears then that the
free standing house is the stumbling block. Its
individuality is already lost, newly-wed subdi-
visions with last vestiges of romantic Norman.
A crowded
section in
the foreign
quarter of a
modern city.
Cotswold, or Tudor, feebly attempt to cover up
the essential standardization that have taken place,
and the conclusion that the isolated domestic unit
cannot be made sound, beautiful and efficient except
at a prohibitive cost is true.
The answer to the question—How shall the fun-
damental requisites of domestic life be embodied in
a modern community program?—is: establish an
integral architecture, beginning with the community
first, and treating the problems of economics, com-
munity planning, technics and architecture as one,
seeking a solution not in terms of the individual
"cell" but in terms of the larger unit. In brief
then Mr. Mumford has shown us that the single
house fails to achieve economy, utility, individual-
ity, as well as communal relationship, that mass-
production housing could not be a solution, and
further that an integral architecture, such as that
conceived of by Mr. Henry Wright, is a much more
desirable scheme, using these factors as a measure.
The aim of integral architecture is to effect an
economy which will raise and spread the standards
of the modern house, by endeavoring to secure,
through site planning, and site development through
orientation to sunlight and wind, a result that can
otherwise be obtained only through an expen-
sive mechanical contrivance. The chief factors in
achieving it are interest rates, wage scales, avail-
ability of water and electricity, the topography and
the character of the soil, and the community plan
itself; each of these having a great control over
the design and type of building material or the
method of construction. The right political and
economic form for modern community building is
perhaps one of the most important social questions

WILLIAM MIKULAS
IT might be well to give herein the history of
the picture of Bill Mikulas that accompanies
this sketch, for Mike's only failing seems to be
that he photographs miserably. Anyhow, when he
had his first proofs made up for his senior picture,
we were invited along for a glimpse under the
promise that an amusing time would be had by all.
Thus it turned out. Each and every one was exe-
crable, and our young man had to make one attempt
after another before he caught the camera napping
and eventually secured something to his liking.
The mere fact that he ably coped with such a
difficult situation certainly stamps him as a man.
Delving into chronology, Mike was born in Pitts-
burgh, but by the time that he had attained the
age of two, he found the local atmosphere so un-
satisfactory that he petitioned his family to move
to Detroit. This they obligingly did, and it was
in the latter metropolis that he prepared himself
to take the University by storm.
Taking up residence in Ann Arbor in the fall of
1928, Mike quickly made Phi Eta Sigma, and then
proceeded to win Gemmel, Mendelbaum, and Dono-
van scholarships in successive years. He was also
initiated into Tau Beta Pi last fall, and recently was
made a member of Phi Lambda Upsilon, honorary
chemical society.
Mike has developed a special fondness for metal-
lurgy, and will take his B.S. in Ch.E. this coming
June. He has also done a great deal of routine
work along this line for the Department of Engi-
neering Research under Prof. Wood, and he is
president of the local student chapter of the A.I.Ch.
E.,—which latter office places him automatically on
the Engineering Council. Further, he is a student
member of the American Society of Steel Treating,
and the American Institute of Mining and Metal-
lurgical Engineers.
Mike is a member of Triangle social fraternity
and has served as president of the group this year.
SPOTLIGHT
WILLIAM R. WORBOYS
THERE is really very little to say about Bill
Worboys, for any attempt to use our cus-
tomary wit would not only fall quite flat but
would be adding insult to injury. Despite the fact
that he seems to stand up under it remarkably well,
Bill is one of the most "kidded" men in the college,
for some unknown reason.
Bill's forte lies in the field of publications work,
on the Daily to be exact. After suffering the routine
annoyances of a tryout, he was appointed assistant
business manager of the Summer edition of the
paper in his sophomore year. Following this he was
made foreign advertising manager, and last summer
stood supreme as business manager.
It is whispered that at this latter time, he was
also business manager of the Directory, the only
graft that can be proved against him. This is mere
heresay, however, and may be pure fiction.
Bill seems to have a fondness for travel and dur-
ing weekends is one of the most inaccessible men
on the campus. One time we located him after
some three and a half days of patient effort and
emitted a sound like pained surprise, only to have
Bill inform us that he thought that it was an oppor-
tune moment to do some studying,—this in a rather
sour tone of voice.
It is told how last spring he
bought a car for something like ^^^^^^^^^^
a thousand dollars and subse-
quently spent about seven hun-
dred on repairs. On one trip
of six hundred miles, to make
things worse, report has it that
the car saw fit to consume
thirty quarts of oil,—wherefore
the kidding to which he is sub-
jected. But then again life
probably would be uninterest-
ing without such episodes.
Bill is a member of Triangles
and Vulcans, honor societies,
and of Alpha Tau Omega fra-
ternity.

OUR ALUMNI
HADLEY BALDWIN
PROFESSOR ALBERT E. WHITE
ONE of the most important units in the fabric
of the University which lie outside of the
routine of imparting classroom instruction
is the Department of Engineering Research. The
truth of this statement is borne out by the fact
that, in the past few years, the department has
assisted industry in solving its problems in a vol-
ume indicated by the better than a quarter million
dollars annual charges. Intimately associated with
the development and administration of the depart-
ment is Prof. A. E. White, its first and, thus far,
only Director.
Prof. White was born in Massachusetts, and in
the course of time attended Brown University
where he received an A.B. degree in 1907. The
next year he spent in study at Harvard before be-
coming associated with the Jones and Laughlin
Steel Co., with whom he was in charge of research
dealing with iron ores, flue dust and fire brick.
Then in 1911 he came to the University as an in-
structor in chemical engineering (metallurgy), and
was made an Assistant Professor in 1913.
From June, 1917, until March, 1919, he did active
duty with the Army Ord-
nance Corps, mainly with the
Metallurgical Branch of the
Inspection Section, and at the
end of this time he returned
to the University with the
rank of full Professor. The
next year saw the birth of the
Department of Fuigineering
Research, and since that time
his teaching duties have
dwindled, at present being
confined to graduate work in
metallurgy. In 1925 he re-
ceived the honorary degree of

PROF. ALBERT E. WHITE
HADLEY BALDWIN
IT is our extreme pleasure this month to present
to you, who do not already know him, a man
whom we think is deserving of all we are about
to say concerning him. He is Hadley Baldwin, a
Michigan engineering graduate in the class of 1893.
It was back in the days when the Engineering Col-
lege was just another group of courses in the Col-
lege of Literature, Science, and the Arts.
His success and popularity started his brilliant
career when he was elected president of his senior
class. He still considers this in its way to be the
most gratifying distinction of his experience. Upon
leaving the University, he found application for his
technical training in railway work. It was only a
short time after graduation that Mr. Baldwin ob-
tained employment with the Cleveland, Cincinnati,
Chicago and St. Louis Railway Company as As-
sistant Engineer. This was the first rung of the
long ladder of accomplishments he has so success-
fully climbed up. It seems as if persistent hard
work was something inherent in Mr. Bradley for
he was so successful at his first real job that he
was soon made Supervisor of Track. This new pro-
motion was a stimulus to go on and he responded
by winning the position of Division Engineer. His
progress may be compared to a big round stone,
which, after once being set in motion, is harder to
stop than most people would think. He was then
successful in his capacity as Division Superintend-
ent, Assistant Chief Engineer and Chief Engineer.
He occupied this much envied position until March
1, 1924, with his headquarters in Cincinnati. In
February of last year, the C. C. C. &amp; St. L. Railway
Company and the New York Central were consoli-
dated. Mr. Baldwin was called upon to take over
the duties of Chief Engineer of the New York Cen-
tral Railroad, C. C. C. &amp; St. Louis region. It is
this position that he is occupying at present.
It is a source of great encouragement for our
Michigan students to note the success of their
alumni and Mr. Baldwin's is certainly one that

HERE'S THE NEWS—
Hello Alumni:
Believe you us, this last month has really shown
a fine response from our grads. We have a stack of
letters here so high that it won't be possible to print
all their interesting contents in one issue, but don't
feel slighted if your name isn't here this month be-
cause we assure you that it will be the first to
receive consideration the next time we hold our
regular meeting. We are overjoyed to hear from
so many but you can bet that our pleasure is not
half so great as that of your old classmates who
haven't heard from you since you crammed for your
finals. Anyway I think we had better start open-
ing them:
1899
The top of the heap tells us that W. E. Minshall
of 2939 Weybridge Rd., Shaker Heights, Ohio, is
chairman of the board in the Pocahontas Oil Cor-

Tau Beta Pi Awards
Marshall Anderson, '32E, is one of 23 men to have
been awarded Tau Beta Pi fellowships. On Satur-
day, the Executive Council of the National Engi-
neering Honor Society passed on applications for
the coining year's fellowships, and made six awards.
One fellowship was given to a man already gradu-
ated. Of the five winning undergraduates from all
over the country, Anderson came first. In addition
to being a top man scholastically in the College of
Engineering, Anderson has earned part of his col-
lege expenses, is President of the Student Branch
A.S.M.E., and president of the Michigan Gamma
Chapter of Tau Beta Pi.
Competition for these awards is on a national
basis. This year Professor A. D. Moore, Alumni
Representative and in charge of administering the
fellowship program, received and studied 94 appli-
cations. Of the 62 chapters in Tau Beta Pi, 49 were
represented by this year's applications alone.
When the six Fellows begin their graduate work
next fall, Tau Beta Pi will have entered the fourth
year of the fellowship program with 23 engineering
graduates, in all, having been supported at $750.00
each. Thus, in the first four years, the society will
have contributed $17,250.00 for the furtherance of
graduate study and research in engineering.
For the four years, 178 men in all have applied
for these fellowships. Michigan has been three
times represented in the awards. Karl Kammer-
meyer, '31 Chem. E., was Fellow No. 4. Marshall
Anderson is to be Fellow No. 19. Alexander
Cowie, Wisconsin '32 and Fellow No. 13, is now
taking his graduate work here in engineering me-
chanics.
Anderson will take his year of graduate work
here, studying the engineering and economic aspects
of power generation and distribution.
This is a leading program of its kind among
honor societies, and Michigan has played a large
part in its development and support. The fellow-
ship program was conceived and adopted during the
six years (1924-30) when the Executive Council
was made up of three Michigan faculty members,—
C. T. Johnston. H. H. Higbie, and A. D. Moore.
As Alumni Representative, Professor Moore admin-
isters the program, receives applications, and makes
preliminary studies. The present Executive Coun-
cil is at Ohio State University. Professor Moore
sat with the Council on March 24-25. while Council
awards were being made.
o
Tau Beta Pi Initiation
Three members of the faculty of the College of
Engineering and twenty-two juniors were initiated
into Tau Beta Pi on the evening of March 29. A
banquet was held at the Union immediately after
the initiation, with Prof. Thomas H. Reed of the
political science department addressing the group.
The faculty men made members were Professors
Walter E. Lay of the automotive department, Rob-
ert H. Sherlock of the civil department and Axel
Marin of the marine engineering department.
The members of the class of '33E that were initi-
ated at the same time were: William D. Allison,
I.eRoy T. Anderson. Orville E. Bottorff, DeElton
J. Carr, Richard N. Cogger, Thomas D. Coleman,
Helmer L. F. Enlund, Lloyd P. Frankel, Donald J.
Haefele, Robert E. Hayes, Harold P. Hesler,
William W. Jenney, Bruce H. Maddock, Mathias
F. Matzek, Edward I. Ryder, Walter J. Simons,
George M. Skinner, George R. Squibb, Lloyd A.
Staebler, Peter M. VanWingen, Cecil C. Waldo, and
Walter E. Wilson.
A. I. Ch. E.
The national organization of the A. I. Ch. E.
offers, each year, a prize to the sophomore of each
of the student branches who made the best scho-
lastic record in his freshman year. The prize in-
cluded a student membership pin and a certificate
of recognition. It is hoped that these awards will
increase the general interest in the Institute and
also tend to raise the scholastic standing of the
members.
At Michigan this year, the prize was awarded to
two men, Virgil C. Williams and August C. Her-
shey. Each of these men had an average of 3.71
and were almost identical in all their phases of
activity. The student chapter has taken a great
pride in making these awards and trusts that the
two men will be worthy members of the organiza-
tion.
In response to a demand of the majority of the
chapters a problem has been made up to be worked
by individual members of the various chapters on a
competitive basis. Prize awards of $100, $50 and

Chemical Inspection Trips
In keeping with the idea of supplementing class-
room and laboratory work with glimpses of actual
plant operation, the Chemical Engineering Depart-
ment has thus far sponsored two inspection trips
this year and there are more in prospect.
On November fourth some fifty graduate and
undergraduate students in the department travelled
to St. Clair by automobile or the bus which was
chartered for the trip to look over the factory of
the Diamond Crystal Salt Company. The group
was divided up into four divisions for flexibility
and to the end that everyone could hear the ex-
planations of the men in charge. Following the
lunch hour, Professor Badger explained the se-
quence of the operations employed by the com-
pany.
Then on December fourth about thirty men
visited the plant of the Continental Sugar Company
at Blissfield. A flow sheet of the typical operations
employed by a beet sugar plant was posted in the
Chemical Engineer seminar room in the East
Engineering building so that men who were un-
familiar with the operations could verify their
observations upon their return.
These trips are desirable, not from the spectacular
point of view as being merely an interesting show
to watch, but, rather, they serve to show the student
how the tools that he is trained to use in college
will find application upon his graduation.
The departments pioneering in these student trips
are surely to be commended for their progress in
linking the practical with the theoretical. We can
only hope that more of this will be done in the
future in the interest of the student of engineering. o
Another Engineering Smoker
Do you remember the fine time you had at the
Engineering Smoker last year? Well, the Engi-
neering Council is planning another one for you
this spring. Last year over 350 attended and heard
the fine speaker and enjoyed the splendid entertain-
ment. But this year a bigger and better program
is planned. They have chosen as a speaker, Mr.
Fishleigh, a consulting engineer in Detroit, formerly
head of the design department of the Packard
Motor Car Company. He promises to be a very
interesting man and will have as his subject some-
thing that will be instructive to anyone connected
with the engineering profession. The entertain-
ment planned is the best yet. Coach "Let" Philbin
has promised a fast boxing match between Harvey
Bauss, '33E, and some opponent unnamed as yet.
Negotiations are being made with Coach Keen to
secure a wrestling match of paramount interest.
It may be possible to obtain one between Cliff
Stoddard and Captain Dougovito of the wrestling
team. Besides that many surprise acts are being
planned—a dance band to furnish music during the
evening—and last but best—refreshments will be
served. You'll have all the "smokes" you want,
too. It won't hurt your pocket books either since
the price has been lowered to a new repression level.
Fellow Engineers, the Engineering Council is
your council. You elect the men on it. They are
there to foster a better school spirit, a better co-
operation between the students and the faculty.
They are putting on these smokers just for that
reason. Your "profs" will be there, not on the pro-
gram but mixing in the audience with all of you.
Come yourselves and have an informal talk with
them, smoke with them, laugh with them. And
meet your fellow classmates. This is one time
when the whole school turns out. Let's get behind
this and push. We'll make the "lousy Lits" and
the "Ypsi girls" take notice.
So long—we'll be seeing you there.
Something Constructive
At last it seems that some of the formerly stag-
nant honor societies on this campus are actually
doing something. Reference is made to the efforts
of Triangles, Junior Engineering honorary, to re-
vise the classification system.
At its meeting April 3, at which Assistant Dean
Lovell and Professor Brier were present, the sys-
tems in other schools were discussed and methods
suggested for revising our present system to elimi-
nate the mad scramble to which we are subjected
twice yearly.
The present plan, which gives a personal contact
with the classifier and keeps a close check on the
fullness of sections, has many good points and it
seems that only slight revisions would be necessary
to bring about the desired results.
The members of this society are to be compli-
mented on an effort at something constructive
rather than to allow themselves to be "just another
honorary."

that architecture must face. Intelligent selection
of the site, the design of the street and road system,
and here the distinction between domestic areas and
industrial as well as commercial areas must he made
permanent for the prevention of speculative infla-
tion.
Out of an acute awareness to this situation, and
a devotion to the cause of more beautiful cities,
Mr. Henry Wright developed the following scheme.
Two possibilities presented themselves, the first
being the garden apartment which promised to
replace the existing tenement areas. This, how-

people for whom it was intended as a relief; the
second was Group Row Housing and it offers a
real solution. Mr. Wright's clear and unclouded
concept of social aspects of community planning
along with his imaginative solutions of the mass
plans are two attributes of his genius which have
annihilated blighted areas in his own work at Rad-
burn, Pittsburgh and St. Louis and the Sunnyside
development on Long Island. The specific beauty
of Mr. Wright's scheme lies in the fact that it does
not require a complete revolution of our ideas of
city building and land ownership. He points out
that there have been built, recently, sixty per cent
multi-family dwellings as against forty per cent
single-family dwellings, and that both New York
and Chicago are illustrating the apartment house
trend by definitely merging from a period of bad
small-unit multi-family dwellings to a more prom-
ising (though far from ideal) standard of large
apartment buildings. The actual preference by
many people for the multi-family dwelling, the
economy which places it within the means of an
increasing number of people, and the preference of
loaning institutions, which have found that under
present conditions, the more elastic equity of the
multi-family is to be preferred, are the effective
causes of this new situation; however, some of
these smaller flats are badly planned and thoroughly
unlivable and rentals have been expanded to meet
extravagant financing costs.
In this analysis of the place of the apartment in
the community it is found that the larger elevator
types are seeking the most favored areas, best
served by streets and traffic facilities, bordering on
parks and lake fronts and accessible to every sort
of public improvement and social advantage. But
these more desirable sites are still relatively few,
and the problem of the hinter land is still unsolved.
This new trend has not replaced the smaller two-
story four-family or three-story six-family flat.
This latter type usually has a forty-foot street
frontage, elongating itself backwards with about a
four-foot passage way between it and the next
building. This is the typical situation in the
blighted areas and the one Mr. Wright has de-
feated by his solution. Zoning has segregated this
undesirable type, but has done nothing to extermi-
nate it or improve its form. Heating is done by
each tenant, grass disappears in favor of concrete,
and the view, if not down on a muchly trafficked
street, is confined to a few square feet of white-
washed wall.
Realizing that there was enough wasted space
in the average American neighborhood to provide
it with an adequate park, Mr. Wright demonstrated
this fact to be true and effectively embodied it in
his plan of Radburn. The group row house in the
quadrangle plan reduces the cost of heating, refrig-
eration, and taxation per family since the length
of street utilities is reduced as well as the actual
paving. Moreover, the use for additional service
streets and alleys does not exist in this scheme,
where heat comes in through a pipe, light over a
wire, and garbage vanishes as smoke through the
chimney. Not only has this architect achieved a
more beautiful and effective architectural unit as
well as a more healthful environment for those
people now existing in the blighted areas, but he
is also able to show those land owners a profit of
about one and a half per cent more per year on
their present holdings. Exclusive of the economy
of centralized heat, and refrigeration is the added
one due to the fact that the houses are continuous,
fifty per cent more tenants can be housed on the
same area with an atmosphere of much greater
freedom; each tenant has approximately twenty-
five square feet of earth on which to plant his own
specific type of flowers, the central portion being
maintained by the land owners.
Realizing that mere aestheticism as the only vir-
tue of any scheme to better environment under the
present system of land ownership was ineffectual,
because land owners pick up their ears not at the
mention of how much more healthful their tenants
will become, how much more attractive will their
property become, how much more virtuous they will
have become, but only at how much more re-
munerative will their investment have become, Mr.
Wright has, by dint of his genius, struck home a
far-reaching and deeply felt blow to a problem that
has for a long time driven weaker men to complete
resignation.
LAW GOVERNING PRIVATE PROPERTY
(Continued from page 8)
minimum of restrictions should be placed upon the
pioneer as he plans bigger and better buildings.
And so the test of reasonable use of property should
encourage, not restrict, the use of deeper and safer
foundations.
The landowner, in the reasonable use of his prop-
erty, is bound to give notice of his plans to his
neighbor, so that the neighbor can take care of
his extant building. In fact, it would appear rea-
sonable that the landowner permit his neighbor to
enter during the operation of underpinning. Some
jurisdictions hold so strictly to this doctrine that
if an excavating landowner, having given due notice
to his neighbor to protect his building and his
neighbor having taken no action in the matter, pro-
ceeds at his own peril to underpin the adjacent
building. In other words, he can no more collect
for the cost of underpinning which he has done as
a volunteer and inter meddler, than he could if he
voluntarily paid his neighbor's grocery bill. Stat-
utes, ordinances and city building codes are rather

he exercised by a building landowner.
Tbe use of explosives in blasting for foundations
offers a good illustration. A contractor may use
deep drill holes with large quantities of dynamite,
or shallow holes with small quantities of dynamite.
The first method would offer cheaper labor costs
and more speedy progress. On the other hand
these deep holes heavily loaded would cause greater
damage and annoyance from the noise, jar, and
pieces of flying rock. . Due care and skill would re-
quire that a happy medium be adopted, using such
depth of drill and such charge of dynamite as will,
under all of the circumstances, cause the least an-
noyance to the public and the least extra expense
and delay to the erection of the building. Of course,
this is all a matter of fact to be established by
expert testimony.
And so we find that the property rights of a fee
simple landowner are governed by the reasonable
use of his land. And this reasonableness shall be
tested, not by what rights he would like to enjoy,
but rather in view of all of the circumstances of our
modern social structure, giving due consideration to
the sovereign power of the state, to the rights of
neighboring property owners, and most important,
to the welfare of the public as a whole.

We leave you, then, with a note of hope and
a firm belief that the future of the autogiro is very

JTROM the Flickering light of a neon tube on the skyline of New
'York City/ a speech was sent to the S. S. President Hoover, 3000
feet away. The small neon tube changed the electric impulses from
a microphone into light waves, which were directed to the ship in
a narrow beam. A photoelectric tube in the center of a receiving
mirror on the ship changed the light impulses back into sound, and
the speech was heard on board.
The use of light that can be heard, and of sound that can be seen,
has many applications. It can be used for speech communication; it
can serve in fog to guide aircraft on their course and into port; and
it can be used for radio and television broadcasting.
The development of future forms of transmission, whether in sound
or light waves, will largely be the responsibility of college-trained
General Electric engineers. To-day, these men are planning, pro-
ducing, and testing electric equipment which will help maintain
General Electric's leadership in its field.

provides a method of fabricating metal
without slow and expensive mechanical
jointing ... By making joints stronger
than the metal itself, it permits the use of
lighter material or the substitution of
shape-cut fabricated parts for castings...
And by making a smooth, invisible joint,
it makes painting, lacquering, enamel-

"Hello, Hawaii
Bringing Hawaii within speaking distance
of the United States is one of the latest
achievements of the Bell System in its pro-
gram of telephone service extension.
Five years ago the United States had tele-
phone connection only with Canada, Cuba,
and the Mexican border. Since then, Bell
engineers have so developed radio telephony
that handling calls to Kurope, South America,
Australia, Bermuda, Samoa, and Hawaii is
daily routine. Today more than 31,000,000
telephones can be reached — approximately
92% of all the telephones in the world!
Making the telephone practically world-
wide in reach promotes understanding be-
tween nations. It has far reaching effects com-
mercially and politically. That's what puts
the thrill into such Bell System pioneering.

Aircraft Engine
by Prof. HUGH E. KEELER
A typical Diesel aircraft installation
THE Diesel principle is not new, but the his-
tory of its practical application to the air-
craft industry covers a span of slightly over
two years. Packard, the pioneer in this field, offi-
cially presented its first Diesel aircraft engine to the
public at the 1930 National Aircraft Show. This
was the result of three years of research, design-
ing, building, and testing. Much credit is due to
L. M. Woolson (Aeronautical Engineer) and the
others of the Packard staff, who started on the
problem with neither precedent nor engineering
data on the subject. The companies manufactur-
ing Diesels for aircraft have run into interesting
problems, peculiar to this type of engine, which
they are continually striving to solve. Some of
these have resulted only recently in many note-
worthy improvements in the old line of oil burn-
ing power plants. Modern aircraft now have an
even better product to work with in this interest-
ing and extremely valuable field.
After extensive experience in the air with multi-
engined installations, it was found that certain im-
provements would be desirable for this class of
ships. They had not seemed to be necessary during
the flight test work previous to the first announce-
ment, all of which had been carried out with single
motored planes.
When the multi-engined ships were first flown,
it was noticed that in a normal gliding angle pre-
paratory to landing, with the throttle set in ground
idling position, the ship speed was greater and the
engine R. P. M. higher than with a gasoline engine.
Also, that landing with the throttle in ground idling
position the ship would continue to "float" much
longer, requiring additional landing space, unless,
just previous to landing, the throttle was pulled
clear back to the no-stroke position, in which no
fuel is delivered to the engine cylinders. It was
necessary when this was done to open the throttle
to the ground idling position before the engine-
stalled after landing. This required that the pilot
keep watch of the propellers on all engines imme-
diately after wheels contacted with the ground to
enable him to know when the throttle had to be
opened. Also, in some installations where the
brakes were hand operated, the pilot was not free
to handle the throttle until after the brakes were
released, as both operations had to be done with the
same hand.
In single engined ships it is perfectly feasible in
landing to close the throttle completely, producing
a normal landing with no danger of losing the en-
gine. This can be done as the propeller is direct-
ly in front of the pilot for his observation, and the
brakes are foot operated, leaving one hand avail-
able for the throttle at all times.
The reason for the higher engine R. P. M. in a
glide with the throttle in ground idling position
was that the gliding speed of the plane rotated the
propeller in the original engine much faster than
with a gasoline engine; this being due to the fact
that the single valve Diesel engine without a
throttle on the air inlet did not have near the re-
sistance to rotation that the gasoline 2-valve en-
gines do on account of their carburetor throttle
valves. This can be easily demonstrated on a gaso-
line engine in a glide by cutting out the ignition
and then opening the throttle wide.
The first production engines had a hinged type

air-shutter valve in the fore front of the air inlet
to the single valve which, of course, functioned as
both inlet and exhaust. One purpose of this valve
was to keep the cylinders warm during long glides
in extremely cold weather by drawing in warm air
at part throttle, and to maintain better idling on
the ground in cold wealther. The air shutter
valve was inter-connected to the throttle by suitable
linkage so that at idling speed it blocked the en-
trance of fresh air to the cylinder, drawing instead
from the exhaust manifold, and at all cruising
speeds was wide open. This valve did not have
any throttling effect on the air entering the cylin-
der, the same quantity of air entering regardless of
throttle position, except for slight loss in volu-
metric efficiency with increased speed.
After much experimental testing with various
means to choke down or reduce the amount of air
drawn into the cylinders at part throttle and idling
speed, a barrel type air-valve was adopted. It was
placed in the air passage between the valve and in-
through its location, definitely con-
trols the quantity of air that can en-
ter the cylinder, and. in its closed po-
sition, when the throttle lever is in
the idling notch produces a result on
the Diesel engine similar to that
caused by the throttle valve in a car-
buretor on a gasoline engine. That
is, it requires more power to rotate
the engine at idling speed, due to a par-
tial vacuum in the cylinders on the
intake stroke, thereby decreasing the
engine speed in a glide to that of a
gasoline power plant. This valve is
also inter-connected to the throttle
lever in a manner similar to the orig-
inal design through a suitably located
cam to give the desired action to the
air valves relative to throttle position.
At all cruising speeds the valve is
kept wide open and in no way restricts
air entering the cylinder. But, as the
throttle is closed from the cruising
range, the air shutter valve starts to
close, and at the idling speed is shut
up tight except for fairly liberal clear-
ness around the outside diameter. A
small quantity of air is drawn in on
the inlet stroke and discharged on the
exhaust stroke through this clearance
space.
The Packard Diesel Aircraft en-
gine, with this new change, behaves
exactly the same as a gasoline engine
during landing. This new valve sys-
tem allows the pilot to set his throttle in the
ground idling position in the glide preparatory to
landing, and requires no further attention until the
landing has been made and without any possibility
of the engine stalling after landing.
Before this change in the air valve was made,
the engine idled on only three of the nine cylin-
ders. The individual fuel pumps on the other cylin-
ders did not have sufficient stroke to produce com-
bustion until the throttle was opened further. On
the experimental engine having the new type
valve, it was discovered that more fuel was re-
quired for idling, due to the increased work of
rotating the engine with the air inlet throttled.
This increase was sufficient for the engine to be
idled on all nine cylinders and a more positive idle
was obtained; the variation in any one cylinder not
affecting the R. P. M. as much as with all pumps
working.
A real improvement in acceleration both on the
ground and in the air was also made through the

firing of all cylinders when idling. This was ac-
complished by eliminating the lag when opening
the throttle, before the remaining six cylinders
started firing. A quicker response also was ob-
tained from these cylinders on account of their
higher initial cylinder temperature, resulting from
combustion when slowly turning over.
To obtain complete combustion and the low spe-
cific fuel consumption characteristic of the Diesel
type engine when operated at its recommended
speed, it is necessary to provide a certain excess
of air over that required to combine with the fuel
delivered. This excess of air in many cases amounts
Two famous
aviators view
a modern Diesel
installation
to as much as 25% of the air drawn into the cylinder
on the intake stroke. However, the maximum
power of a Diesel engine is delivered without this
excess amount of air and is obtained by injecting
an extra amount of fuel into the cylinder which
combines with nearly all of the excess air. This
is referred to as the "overloading" condition in
Diesel engine operation; meaning that an over-
amount of fuel is injected and that under this con-
dition combustion is not as complete as when oper-
ated at its recommended speed and load. This re-
sults in the engine smoking somewhat and in a
slight increase in fuel consumption.
There are, of course, other factors that affect the
cleanliness of combustion and absence of smoke.
Some of these are turbulence, rate of burning degree
of atomization of the fuel as sprayed into the cylin-
der, compression ratio, timing, duration of injec-
tion, and many others.
The original combustion chamber of the Packard
Diesel Aircraft engine was very carefully designed,
taking into account all of those factors necessary
to obtain the low specific fuel consumption charac-
teristic of the Diesel cycle. However, during the
experimental work on various compression ratios,
working from 20 to 1 down to 12 to 1, different
changes in the piston top contour was made to ob-
tain these ratios. The 14 to 1 compression ratio
finally adopted differed somewhat from the original
ratio, and although the combustion chamber as de-
termined by this ratio piston was slightly different,
it was not thought it would have any effect on com-
bustion.

TROPICAL jobs frequently open up for grad-
uating engineers. When they do they always
demand that difficult decision of "to take or
not to take". When I finished at Ann Arbor in 1916
the unusually bad market for engineers made the
decision easier to make. I said "yes", and therein
lies a tale.
As is usual in such cases I signed a year's con-
tract in New York and at once got aboard a boat
going south. The eleven days to the destination in
Santa Domingo was chock full of
interest. Wre lumbered along at
a ten mile an hour rate, the chief
diversion being to stand in the
bow watching the flying fish
skimming out and away in front
of us, like so many elongated
humming birds.
The rainy season was on (Sep-
tember) and while the boat was
generally under a clear sky there
were always local showers in
view. At times as many as five
heavy cumulus clouds at scat-
tered points could be seen drop-
ping their load in the form of rain.
Between times we enjoyed visiting with other
passengers, most of whom were returning from
short sojourns in the "States". One little English-
man would repeatedly break into Spanish and then
hastily apologize for forgetting we didn't know a
word of the lingo. Socially they nearly all seemed
to have the characteristic detached view of tropi-
cal exile.
Cape Hatien came into view while still ninety
miles away. Then we touched at Monte Christi.
At Purta Plata we could see shell holes in the little
fort. A few weeks before one of our cruisers had
hammered it during the landing of the marines.
Here, as at Sandez and Samana we exchanged
cargo, after which we rounded the east end of the
island and dropped off at the little town of La Ro-
mona.
Life was certainly different, for better and for
worse. Salaries, as usual, ran double what they
would be at home. The theory is that the other
half is bonus for working in such a blankety-blank
place—and there's logic in that. The food was
punk. The initial breakfast was gotten together by
an Knglish negress, a so-called cook. There was
bread without butter, jet black coffee sans milk and
triple salted burnt oatmeal served up like soup.

come a new alumnus writer

There is a great deal of value

However, things were rarely that bad and often very
good. \Ve learned to like the native staple of rice
and red beans boiled up together.
When we landed there were half a dozen Ameri-
cans at La Romona. Things developed rapidly so
that a year later there were seventy-five or more of
us, including a lady who supervised the kitchen.
The sugar plantation had started four years before.
When we landed it boasted of a dock, seventeen
miles of standard gauge railroad, perhaps ten square
miles of sugar cane and half a
dozen stone houses. Boats from
the "States" came in twice a
month. The next town, Moliris,
was forty miles down the coast by
horseback.
The price of sugar was going
up with the result that it was de-
cided to plant six more square
miles of cane. The land was cov-
ered with a semi-tropical growth
of bush, vines and light timber, all
jumbled in together. Most of our
work called for plane surveying.
The line of the railroad had to be
extended and the boundaries of
thirty, one-hundred acre fields laid out.
For a while two of us lived in a shack twenty
miles from town. In the morning we'd each go
our way to where we had left off working the
night before. Picture yourself trailing off through
the bush with perhaps ten natives, a boss who
runs the gang, (generally mine was a smart aleck
that required a thorough cussing twice a week),
two or three acheros (axmen), three or four mach-
ettros (machette-men) and a couple of kids for the
line roads. The capitas (boss) carried the tran-
sit.
Engineering consisted of standing over the
gang, giving them a shot once in a while, and plug-
ging away at the Spanish grammar between times.
We would cut a swath perhaps three feet wide. If
we hit a six-foot diameter ceiba tree and couldn't
notch a sight, we'd offset. If we hit a lignum vitae,
we'd pay for the ax that cut it. A half mile or so
of line would be a day's work.
There was plenty of excitment between times.
The natives flashed a wicked machette and some-
one of them used to get knocked off every once in
a while. Once we tried to pay a visit to a couple
of engineers on the Rio Jabon. We didn't find

ARODYNAMICS, i.e., the mechanics of fluid
motion, constitutes the essential part of the
equipment of an aeronautical engineer.
This new branch of mechanics, although evolved
from hydrodynamics, deserves a name of its own even
though many theoreticians do not approve of it. They
say that the term Aerodynamics contains more pre-
tense than substance, since in our theoretical consider-
ations we still use the assumption of a fictitious non-
viscous and noncompressible fluid medium. We should
therefore abide by the term Hydrodynamics, referring
to the well established branch of applied mathematics
as founded and developed by such men as Euler, La-
grange, Stokes, Tomson, Tail. Kirchhoff, and Ilelm-
holtz and presented in the form of a classical treatise
by Lamb. We can, however, calmly put forward our
claim to independence, and this—for the following
reasons:
(1) Hydrodynamics, although a much older branch
of Mechanics of Fluid Motion, is laboring under the
same handicap of the same fictitious medium, for the
well-known reason of avoiding mathematical difficul-
ties in the treatment of its problems, and in that re-
spect, therefore, it is not any better than Aerodynam-
ics.
(2) Due to the development of aeronautics the
experimental phase of aerodynamics, particularly since
Eififiel's time, has made such rapid strides that it
can be considered really as an independent and
originally developed branch of mechanics.
(3) Some notable and promising attempts have
been made to introduce in the theory of fluid mo-
tion the effects of viscosity and compressibility of
the medium without undue mathematical compli-
cations (Lord Rayleigh, Bryan, Broszko), bringing
out, therefore, a complete emancipation of aero-
dynamics from the heritage of the classical old hy-
drodynamics which teaches that every body is a
streamlined body and that its total reaction upon
the medium is zero.
However, the youngest branch of engineering,
Aeronautncal Engineering, has profited so much,
Lightness of con-
struction and
streamlining com-
bine to increase
interurban speed
not only from hydrodynamics but also from all the
other branches of engineering, such as civil (theory
of structures), marine (theory of propulsion and
stability), and particularly from mechanical, or
more strictly, automotive engineering to which it
owes its engine, that the time is getting ripe for the
so-called areo-man to begin to repay, at least par-
tially, the great debt incurred.
The development of aeronautics also gave a new
impetus to the research in the domains of the
theories of elasticity, strength of materials and
structures, which resulted in a remarkable exten-
sion and refinement of the methods of analysis and
design. The old adage, that an engineer is a man
who can do for a dollar what every fool can do for
three, can now be paraphrased in this manner: "An
aeronautical engineer is a man who can do for one
pound of avoirdupois what every other engineer can
do for three." It is only natural that these im-
proved and new methods of analysis, devised for
or by the aero-man, are gradually finding their way
into other branches of engineering.
An account of these contributions would deserve
special treatment. W7e will limit ourselves in this
brief article to a brief enumeration of a series of
problems in other branches of engineering where
the application of the principles of aerodynamics is
already serving well and could serve further if the
"other" engineers were better acquainted with aero-
dynamics and were aware of the possibilities in that
direction. Thus the following problems, at least,
should be briefly mentioned here:

usual rule of 30 pounds per square foot of area ex-
posed directly to the wind, while satisfactory, is
rather too exacting for tall buildings, chimney
stacks, etc., and is quite often inadequate for large
billboards of certain proportions—particularly when
on top of high buildings.
(2) Wind effect on roofs. The present rules are
erroneous, if not totally wrong, although they put
the designer on the safe side.
(3) Wind effect on bridges. The lateral wind
pressure on a bridge is usually taken care of by
means of special framework or bracing in a hori-
zontal plane. The rather old rule used for determi-
nation of the air forces in this case is too exacting,
as is judged from modern wind tunnel tests of
bridges.
Not long ago, however, a new wind effect on
bridges was discovered in the Michigan wind tun-
nel, resulting in a pressure perpendicular to the
floor of the bridge. The resulting air forces are
rather appreciable, as they might be many times
greater than the above mentioned lateral wind
forces; besides, due to even a moderate inclination
of the bridge floor with respect to the direction of
wind, they can be magnified several times. There
are two occasions for such inclinations:
(a) A bridge in open space, therefore subjected
to generally horizontal winds, but the bridge is
tilted transversely as it is located on a railroad
curve;
(b) The bridge is transversely level but it
crosses a swift mountain river. Since the winds
over the mountains are deflected in directions gen-
erally parallel to the directions of the valleys with
their sloping bottoms, therefore such a bridge floor
may be attacked by the wind at an appreciable
angle just as well from below as from above.
While there is hardly a case on record of a
bridge collapse due to an unusually strong wind,
this may be only the result of the usual factors of
safety in bridge design, these being (fortunately)
high enough to cover sufficiently any unforeseen
additional loads. It is, however, always better to
know more exactlv where we stand in a structural

The Graham Blue-Streak, an example of radical streamlining
design. It might be worth while to recall at this
point that the late Professor John R. Allen used to
say that it would be more proper and correct to re-
fer to the factor of safety in engineering calcula-
tions as "factor of ignorance". As a matter of fact,
due to a refinement of the methods of determining
the forces acting upon the structures and of the
methods of stress-analysis it became possible to
lower the factor of safety in aeronautical engineer-
ing, considerably below the values common in other
branches of engineering, without handicapping the
safety and reliability of aircraft.
(4) Protection of highways and railroad tracks
from sand and from snoii'drifts. Here again, the scale-
model wind-tunnel method can offer great facilities
for the study of the underlying phenomena.
(5) Flow of gases, rapors and liquids through con-
duits. Almost an unlimited number of problems, in re-
ducing the pressure-head drop or in promoting
more turbulent flow, present themselves:
(a) In connection with the design of all kinds of
ducts, pipe lines, channels and their parts such as
turns, elbows, tees, gates, valves, etc.;
(b) In connection with the design of passages,
by-passes, nozzles, manifolds, vanes, impellers, etc.
in turbines, pumps, compressors, steam engines, gas
engines, etc.;
(c) In connection with the design of fire boxes,
flues, draft dampers, etc. in furnaces (metallurgical
or for heating), steam boilers, etc.;
(d) In connection with the design of superheat-
ers, condensers, heaters, evaporators, etc., etc.: a
truly innumerable quantity of problems present
themselves to any engineer who is versed in prin-
ciples of aerodynamics.
(6) Ventilation, not only of buildings and mines
but also of electric generators, etc., offers interest-
ing possibilities.
(7) Design of electric transmission lines from the
point of view of wind effect in stormy weather,
particularly when the lines are liable to be covered
with ice. Here the Michigan wind-tunnel has al-
ready rendered a useful service in connection with
Prof. Sherlock's research in wind effort.
(8) Design of marine propellers. There seem to
be important possibilities in raising appreciably the
efficiency of the present marine propellers by intro-
duction into these problems of the principals and
methods which followed from the so-called aero-
foil (Drzewiecki) theory of propellers.
(9) Fans and blowers, whether of the air-screw
type or of the centrifugal type, could profit greatly
bjr adaptation of some of the principles and meth-
ods developed more recently by the aerodynamists.
(10) Windmills could stand also an appreciable
amount of improvement in a similar manner as that
suggested for the fans. Quite noteworthy, in this

nius windmills, as well as
the small but powerful
windmills used on air-
planes for driving electric
generators, for radio
'"sending" sets, for light-
ing, etc.
(11) The Flettner ro-
tor-ship and Flettner rud-
der are interesting exam-
ples of the adaptation of
facts, known to aerocly-
namists, to marine engi-
gineering.
(12) Madams rotor-pother plant is perhaps one of
the most interesting applications of the principles
of aerodynamics. It utilizes the aerodynamic prop-
erties of rotating cylinders. Briefly, the rotors,
mounted on cars forming an endless train and
travelling on a circular rail-track, develope drawbar-
pull in the presence of a wind or a sufficient breeze.
This drawbar-pull is utilized in generating electric
energy by driving dynamos from the axles of the
cars. Due to the possibility of using numerous
rotors of enormous size on a single track, this in-
vention appears to be the only one offering possi-
bilities of converting the wind energy into useful
power, in huge quantities (ten to hundreds of thou-
sands of kilowatts from a single plant, as compared
with hardly tens of horsepower from the largest
windmills ever built). As in the Flettner rotor-
ship, the energy necessary to rotate the cylinders is
a small fraction of the energy generated.
(13) Streamlining of vehicles is certainly neither
the least nor the last change for the application of
the principles of aerodynamics, this time, to auto-
motive engineering.
(a) In automobiles, the wind resistance becomes a
more and more important factor in speed, as im-
provement of highways diminishes the road or roll-
ing resistance and at 40 miles per hour begins to
overshadow the latter factor. Here, a too liberal
or too arduous application of the principles of aero-
dynamics might be even more harmful than useful.
For instance, an attempt at reducing the wind re-
sistance to a possible minimum, from a purely areo-
dynamical point of view would result in circular
sectioned and very elongated bodies with pointed
sterns, which would be less roomy and therefore
less comfortable for the occupants and which would
render the already difficult parking question still
more acute. Fortunately, even partial streamlin-
ing offers very interesting possibilities; beveling of
flanks and the roof of the body, and rounding of
corners and edges of the body and the radiator, in
conjunction with slanting and breaking of wind-
Courtcsy Packard Motor Car Co.
The new Packard light eight exemplifies a modern conservatively stream-lined car
shields, fairing of wheels and a rather slight modi-
fication of fenders is sufficient, when skilfully or
properly done, to cut the air resistance of a con-
ventional car nearly in two. Of course, there are
possibilities to reduce the air resistance still fur-
ther by forcing the air, artificially, to hug the body
more closely.
(b) In street cars and particularly in interurbaii
cars the question of streamlining is even of greater im-
portance. Here, due to the fact that the rolling
friction of steel wheels on steel rails is much smaller
than that of rubber tires on cement roads, the air
resistance begins to dominate the road resistance
at speeds below 20 miles per hour in the conven-
tional box-type cars. In this case, streamlining also
should be applied with discretion for the best prac-
tical solution; for instance, everybody knows that
by shaping the body of such a car like a cigar or a
fish the air resistance could be reduced greatly.
However, due to the width and height of the car
being limited and fixed by the existing tracks,
bridges and tunnels, such rigid application of
streamlining would lead to freaks, like the much
advertised Fritz Kruckenberg's "rail-Zeppelin".
On the basis of a very extensive investigation
made recently in the Michigan wind-tunnel, em-
bracing thirty different designs of interurban cars,
it was found that by streamlining only the front and
rear vestibules (while leaving the entire middle-
body of the car intact) it was possible to reduce the
total power necessary to operate the cars, at
speeds in excess of 70 and up to 90 miles per hour,
up to nearly 50% and—by additional fairing of the
bottoms of the cars, afflicted with a mess of resist-
ors, tanks and various auxiliaries—even up to 65%,
in comparison with the conventional box-type car.
However, the operators of the particular system
of interurban lines, for whom this investigation was
made, selected one of the intermediate or compro-
mise solutions offering a total power saving, at the
speeds mentioned, of 30% only. This was done in

Air Break Switch

15000 volt, 1600 ampere
double throw, horizontal
break switch
LKE many other creations of our present day
high-speed civilization, the development of
the high tension air break switch has gone
forward by leaps and bounds, and now, at a high
stage of perfection, it offers an efficiency and de-
pendability which does credit to its designers. The
high tension air break switch is used on both in-
door and outdoor installations but the higher pres-
sure units find their greatest use on outdoor sub-
stations, transmission lines, and switching stations.
The switches are manufactured for use at potentials
as high as 220,000 volts. A device, which at
its birth, was nothing but a "haywire" arrange-
ment of two strips of metal which by some hit or
miss manner could be pulled apart, thereby opening
the circuit, has today become one of the most
kaleidoscopic creations of the engineering field. It
is not surprising that its development has been so
varied when one stops to consider the wide range
of voltages at which different switches must oper-
ate, the many amperage carrying capacities which
must be provided for, and finally the almost num-
berless methods by which the actual break can be
accomplished.
The air break switch field can be divided into two
large classes, as far as operation goes, the hook
stick operated switch and the remote control oper-
ated switch. The hook stick operated, as the name
indicates, is operated by pulling the blade of the
switch out of the contact by means of a hook stick.
These units are almost universally operated "single
pole", that is only one switch is operated at a time.
The remote control switches are usually controlled
from an operating device at the ground which may
be either hand or motor driven. It is with this type
of switch that this article is concerned. They are
normally operated in sets of three, since three phase
transmission of high tension electricity is the stand-
ard method in use today. They may, however, be
connected so that almost any number can be oper-
ated simultaneously according to the requirements
of the wiring arrangement. The individual switches
are connected together by means of levers and
rods and these in turn are connected to a vertical
rod which drops down alongside the structure. The
lower end of the vertical rod is coupled to an oper-
ating handle or a motor mechanism. This verti-
cal rod may either rotate or move up and down in
tension and compression, according to the particu-
lar requirements of the set up.
The single pole unit of the remote control group
operated type of switch is one to which much en-

menting of metal caps and pins to the procelain in-
sulator was long a stumbling block in all large elec-
trical construction. This joint must stand all the
torsion, tension, compression and shear strains set
up in the equipment, and on large pressure, high ca-
pacity switches these strains are enormous. It is
enough to say for those who have perfected the ce-
menting, that the procelain in the insulator rup-
tures more often than the cement fails. Since the
whole of the switch is exposed to the weather, it is
at the mercy of the elements and whatever corrosive
materials and gases that may be in the air. Count-
less non-ferrous alloys have been experimented
with, in order to find those which best resist a cor-
rosive atmosphere. Dead parts of the switch, those
not carrying current, including the base, are usual-
ly made of hot galvanized structural steel or malle-
able iron. As it is very possible for the blade to
freeze into the contact, many devices and methods
of breaking the ice have been adopted. The contact,
too, has a large variety of possible designs. Final-
ly there is the method of the actual "break", that
is, disconnecting the blade from the contact. Be-
fore switches are allowed to leave the manufactur-
er's plant they are usually subjected to rigid tests
for current carrying capacity, heating, flashovers
to ground, both wet and dry, and for many other
possible defects.
The gang operated air break field can be further
subdivided into two large divisions, the horizontal
break and vertical break. In the horizontal break,
the blade rotates in a plane vertical to the axis of
the insulators while in the vertical break, the blade
moves in a plane parallel to the axis of the insu-
lators. The vertical break has a material advantage
in that the distance between the blade and the ad-
jacent unit is not lessened when the switch is oper-
ated. On the horizontal break the blades swing
directly toward the adjacent units when opened,
often necessitating wider spacing between switches
to allow for sufficient electrical clearance.
The 154,000 volt unit illustrated, built by the
Delta Star Electric Company, a leader in the high
tension field, is a good example of the horizontal
break switch. This unit stands six feet high and is
seven feet long. The contacts are of the full float-
ing, self-aligning type, as are those of the other
switches pictured. In other words, the blade does
not have to strike the contact perfectly in order to
get full contact and efficient operation. This unit
also has a grounding blade built in for grounding
the system. The operating device for these ground-
ing blades is usually mechanically interlocked with
the operating mechanism of the switcli itself, so that
incorrect operation is impossible.

illustrated, is unique in that all three insulators ro-
tate. By means of this, the blades "make and
break" with a powerful toggle action, which has
been proved by experiment to be one of the finest
ice breaking motions possible. The operating lever
is connected to the bearing on the center insulator,
and three units are connected for simultaneous
operation, the connecting rod passing to the rear of
the bases. The rods connecting the center bear-
ing to the two outside bearings can be seen in the
illustration. This unit is 5 feet, 4 inches long and
23 inches high.
The 37.000 volt. 600 ampere unit pictured is a
standard switch and is the type that is usually used
on the ordinary transmission line and substation.
By means of levers and links concealed under the
housing on top of the insulators, the blade with-
draws horizontally and then rises to a vertical po-
sition. On the withdrawal motion, a phosphor
bronze torsion spring, located in the fork at the
hinge end of the blade, is wound up and as soon as
the blade frees from the contact the stored energy
in this spring snaps the blade upward giving a very
quick break which is a highly desirable feature. On
closing, the blade swings directly into the contact
with a strong chopping motion. The arcing horns
shown on this unit protect the contact and blade
from burning due to the current spitting across, as
they make contact before the main blade closes and
break away after the main contact is open. Here,
as on the other switches, heavy copper braids are
used to conduct the current from the blade to the
terminal, the mechanism and supports not being
depended upon to carry current.
Perhaps one of the oldest types of air break
switch is the double break per phase unit. On this
type, the switch contacts are placed on two station-
ary insulators and a third rotating insulator, with
blade, is placed midway between them. An efficient
break is secured and the unit still finds much favor
among the horizontal break switches.
Another popular type of switch has a station-
ary insulator supporting the contact while a second
stationary insulator supports the hinge end of the
blade. A third insulator has one of its ends con-
nected to a common operating mechanism while the
other end is attached near the center of the blade

A CHAT WITH ELIEL SAARINEN
by LOUIS E. STEVENS, '33A
and ALAN W. CLENEAY, '33A
Cranbrook School in Bloomfield Hills
a view through the pergola
ENGLISH Poets have been known to tramp
some forty miles or more in a single clay
through woods and around mountains border-
ing on "broad translucent lakes." They were filled
with great spirituality which combined with their
genius in expressing to us the beauty of earth, of
sunlight on trees and of exciting landscapes. We
were able to feel more deeply what they really en-
joyed when we left the highway—the broad ribbon
of concrete with its traffic moving at sixty miles per
hour—and entered on the more sympathetic Lone
Pine Road which gracefully led us to Cranbrook.
We met Mr. Saarinen where he was working on a
model of the new Scientific School for Cranbrook.
Perhaps no one has a more interesting concept of
the immediate problem confronting "creative city-
builders"—for that is what Architects should really
be—than Mr. Saarinen. "Great Architecture," he
says, "is based on common sense." It is the con-
crete expression in design of the nature of our spe-
cific materials with an eye to their colors, textures
and limitations. All art is an expression of the indi-
vidual, conscious only of his own particular medium.
He must not be conscious of the individuality—his
nation—or a specific style—but only of thinking log-
ically and speaking directly to attain a universal un-
derstanding of his work.
In answer to our question—Is a building which is
purely functional necessarily beautiful?—Mr. Saari-
nen pointed out that a practical building is able to
be beautiful only if the Architect has a sub-con-
scious sense for beauty. "Purely practical buildings
are very often ugly buildings and are lacking in pro-
portion, balance of masses of rhythm." However a
building must be essentially practical before it can
be completely and truthfully beautiful.
The question of the skyscraper came next and we
were anxious to hear what Mr. Saarinen had to say
about the most persistent problem in our large
cities. First of all—New York, whose architecture
is perhaps in the most distressed state because of
the lack of orientation of these structures to one an-
other, is seriously concerned with its gigantic prob-
lem of traffic. In Mr. Saarinen's opinion, one half of
New York should be parkways and boulevards.
There is no reason why it should not cover a larger
ground area.
Considerations for the city skyline—the balance
of masses around the city's natural axes—the eco-
nomic and social necessities for new structures and
their relationship to existent ones have been ignored
in an attempt to get more and higher buildings,
closer together. Protective legislation, Mr. Saari-
nen believes, would insure the economic safety as
well as the architectural significance of the sky-
scraper. He stressed the importance of such legisla-
tion being protective rather than restrictive, how-
ever.
In discussing the machine, he pointed out that
as much intelligence was required to know when
not to use it as had been employed in its first con-
ception. Perhaps the ease with which it became
possible, through the ingenuity of the engineer to
build tall structures, the development of high-
speed vertical traffic, are two factors which have
made the skyscraper so hopelessly out of scale with
human beings and which bear out this last state-
ment of Mr. Saarinen's.

Toward Mousing
by PROF. WELLS I. BENNETT
Prof. WELLS I. BENNETT
IT IS characteristic of our accustomed com-
placency over the status quo that only when
prosperity and its amazing commercial archi-
tecture fade from the scene, do we take a serious
interest in housing. America is like that. The
housing problem was there all the time hut we have
just got clown to it. Doubtless we shall now go
in for housing in a big way—quantitatively—and
the outskirts of our cities will boast of larger and
more expensive settlements than have been erected
even in Germany. Whether we shall contribute
anything toward the solution of the housing prob-
lem remains to be seen. In the discussions that have
taken place, even in the President's Conference, it
is not too evident that we see our way clearly.
Such phrases as Rehabilitation of Blighted Areas.
Large Scale Financing and Provision of Employ-
ment bulk large in the scene and there is undeniably
a sweetening flavor of civic mortality, the feeling
that good housing, like the park and playground
movement, is something to be encouraged. But to
the observer the emphasis seems to be on details.
We find it hard to see the forest for the trees.
The success of American housing depends on a
socialized point of view, and a thought-out plan.
Commercial building and public architecture as
well have thrived on our unprecedented economic
expansion and the smug pride which clamored to
give it expression. Back of every skyscraper is the
search for profit, back of most public buildings is
the afflatus of a nation "on the make," generous,
even careless, with tax-collected funds. It is this
psychology of building for display and profit that
threatens to carry over into housing where it has
no place. Our aims must be re-oriented or instead
of creating real housing we shall simply do more
building of houses, quite a different thing.
The financier and the investor have been, before
the deluge, so triumphant, since the deluge, so
pestered for their lives, that they cannot see beyond
their own troubles. They are still thinking of bus-
iness for interest return and immediate profit. The
Buhl Foundation in Pittsburgh, charged with the
erection of an experimental housing settlement
has apparently thought itself very successful when,
after a long and very thorough survey it ar-
rived at a plan which, to be sure, pays only five
per cent return on the investment but which is
financially sure-fire. A scheme planned for incomes
of $2200-$3600, for a "greater degree of social and
economic security", is primarily a sound invest-
ment, and after that perhaps an interesting housing
experiment. One learns that so well has the plan
materialized that its charming houses are sought by
the younger socially elect of Pittsburgh! This is
housing not for those who need it but for those
who are already comfortable and well sheltered.
Again, a rehabilitation scheme is proposed. It is
intended for Chicago but applicable elsewhere, per-
haps in Detroit. Under this plan the bankers, un-
willing holders of increasingly large districts of
decadent city blocks, would pool their holdings to
control a number of contiguous blocks. By in-
genious, highly efficient, and esthetically satisfac-
tory planning of a block at a time in four story
apartments, enough units would be added to the
present number to bring the income on the rebuilt
blocks up to the current return on the existing
shabby, outmoded structures. This proposal is
based on rents of forty dollars per month per apart-
ment, the present average unit return on the area
surveyed in Chicago. Providing that the city
views this improvement with a lenient eye as to
taxation, the scheme seems possible and in some
respects advantageous. The bankers secure re-
newed life in a now fading investment, and the
present tenants get a chance at new and better
homes. They will, however, have to move, and
those in the first block will have to move away,
probably for good. It will, moreover, not in the
least alleviate the present tenants' financial diffi-
culties since their rent will remain the same. The
advantage is still for the old order, for the finan-
cier. On the part of the architect, Mr. Henry

The Law on
Negotiability
by Prof. WALTER C. SADLER
SEVERAL centuries ago an extensive use for
credit and negotiable instruments developed.
English merchants in their dealings abroad
found it convenient to use a form of credit paper
called a Bill of Exchange. By this means a London
merchant could purchase raw material in the Medi-
terranean countries, making payment therefor by
issuing a written order on a foreign bank to pay the
seller a specified sum. This paper, upon clue ac-
ceptance, became negotiable. That is, the selling
merchant could pass the paper on at its face value
to any of his creditors. The benefit of this type of
financial transaction depended upon the willingness
with which the public accepted the paper at its face
value. Both buyer and seller wanted this paper to
travel at its face value not being subject to any de-
fenses or disabilities whatsoever.
History of the Law
The value of these bills of exchange ran into
large sums of money, being often the purchase price
on entire cargoes. It was necessary, therefore, that
specific rules be developed as to the handling of this
form of paper. The body of rules which grew up
from these transactions is embodied in the Law
Merchant, and there are recorded cases touching
this topic as far back as 1600. As time went on
mercantile controversies were carried to the courts
of law, with the result that frequently judicial
notice was taken of the Law Merchant and the
customs of the trade. In other words, the rules
developed by the early day merchants for their
own business relationships gradually became a part
of the common law. During the past fifty years
these rules of negotiability have been gradually
codified. This work resulted in the Bills of Ex-
change Act in England in 1882, followed closely by
similar acts in the United States and Canada. In
the United States this act is known as the Uni-
form Negotiable Instruments Act, and has been
adopted by a majority of the states of the Union.
Nature of Negotiability
Negotiability is the characteristic of title trans-
ferability of a certain class of property. The pe-
culiarities of this type of transfer, however, are dis-
tinctly different from the passing of title to ordi-
nary realty or personalty. Smith, in selling a
horse, offers an implied warranty that he has title
thereto, and he may be held liable for any breach of
that warranty, the buyer holding Smith in case the
true owner demands the animal. That is, if the
true owner could establish that the horse had been
stolen from him, he could recover the horse either
from the thief or from any person who had pur-
chased the horse in good faith. In short, any sub-
sequent purchaser of the horse would act at his own
peril. Possession of the animal would always be
subject to any previous disabilities of title. This
is clearly not a negotiable type of transfer.
This non-negotiable type of transfer would be
most cumbersome and unworkable in the passage of
title of bills of exchange, bank checks, and promis-
sory notes. Every prospective holder of a bank
check, for instance, would have to know its full
history. He would have to decide, at his own peril,
whether the title was clear, and whether the drawer
had any equitable defenses such as insufficient con-
sideration, or a defective quality in the material
sold. This very disability was what the merchants
of old were trying to avoid. The rules governing
bills of exchange were so molded as to give the
instrument the same characteristic as currency.
Everyone who dealt with this paper desired to see it
pass from hand to hand free of restrictions, a
"rider traveling unburdened by luggage".
Consider the case where there are only two par-
ties to a transaction, the maker of the note and the
payee. For instance, if Smith issues a promissorv
note to Fry, and Fry holds the note three months
until maturity, and then tries to collect from Smith,
Smith can set up any of the contractural defenses.
For instance, he might show that he had not re-
ceived the wagon for which this note was the pur-
chase price. The question of negotiability is not
raised because the entire transaction is between
Smith and Fry. However, if an innocent third
party enters the transaction, the situation is re-
versed. Should Fry sell the note to the State Bank,

and Steinmetz
Professor A. D. Moore is undoubtedly one of the best known of
the University of Michigan faculty and to the profession at large as
well as being one of the most congenial and best liked teachers on the
campus. It is always interesting to get such noteworthy side-lights
on the career of such a man as is this little anecdote about the
genial Mr. Moore and the "wizard of modern e'ectricity". Stein-
metz. There is probably no better way to get a picture of the true
character of a man than to catch him off duty, as it were. So here
you are, Mr. Alumnus and Mr. Student; say hello to the well known
Mr. Moore in a new light.

Sketch of Steinmctz by Professor A. D. Moore
IT IS nearly a decade since Dr. Charles P. Stein-
metz died; yet he is remembered to an extent
that few of his contemporaries are. This is not
altogether because of his brilliant achievements as
an engineer, but in part because of his unusual and
interesting personality.
Steinmetz was, of all things, essentially kindly;
and he took a keen and active interest in the newer
generations. In the ten years that he was a mem-
ber of the faculty of Union College in Schenectady,
where he was in charge of the Department of Klec-
trical Engineering, he was one of the most popu-
lar professors there. He mingled with the student
body often, and one of the evidences of the re-
gard in which he was held was his election to mem-
bership in one of the social fraternities—Phi Gam-
ma Delta. In the General Electric Company, of
which he was a consulting engineer, he was al-
ways encouraging and assisting the younger men.
Among those with whom he came into contact,
Dr. Steinmetz was loved as much as he was ad-
mired.
Wherever he went, he was a center of interest.
An interesting example of this is the following
story.
Fifteen or sixteen years ago, our own A. D.
Moore, now Professor of Electrical En-
gineering here, at the University, but
then as undergraduate at the Carnegie
Institute of Technology, was attending
a meeting at the University of Pitts-
burgh. Steinmetz sat a few rows
ahead, and to one side, of him. Moore's
attention was drawn to him as irresist-
ibly as a needle to a magnet. True to
Prof. A. D. MOORE
engineering form, out came pencil .and paper. But
this time it was not a wiring diagram or a graph
to illustrate sine waves that interested him. It was
a portrait; and the sketch shown was the result.
The career of Professor Moore is typical of the
kind Dr. Steinmetz was fond of encouraging. Born
in Eairchance, Pa., January 7, 1895, he graduated
from the Uniontown High School and entered Car-
negie "Tech", from which he graduated in 1915
with the degree of B.S. in E.E.
During the next year he was engaged in the Test-
ing Department of the Westinghouse Electric &amp;
Manufacturing Company. In the fall of 1916 he
went to the University of Michigan as instructor in
the Electrical Engineering Department, and was
successively promoted to assistant professor, asso-
ciate professor, and, in the spring of 1931, to full
professor. In 1922 he received the degree of master
of science from Michigan.
In addition to teaching, he has found time for
extra-curricular work in lecturing, and for writing.
He has given lectures before engineers and research
men of several manufacturing companies, princi-
pally on magnetic and heat subjects in the field of
design, and before college faculties and other groups
on personnel work, laws of teaching and learning,
and kindred subjects. He has also done vacation
work for various companies on engineering, investi-
gation, valuation, and consultation. Among other
things, he helped to develop a short course for elec-
tric metermen, and taught in connection with it.
At the university he has directed graduate students
in attacking minor research problems in several
fields. During one recent vacation he attended the
Summer Training Course for College Professors
conducted by the General Electric at Schenectady.
He is the author of a book, "Fundamentals of
Electric Design", published by McGraw-Hill in

Forty-eight car

machine
A Vertical Parking System has recently been
inaugurated in Chicago by means of which
48 cars can be parked on the ground space
normally allotted to six cars. The new machine
consists of cradles, one for each car, supported be-
tween two endless chains which pass over sprocket
wheels at the top and bottom of travel; the chains
being driven by electric motors.
Not only does this new vertical parking machine
save much-needed space, but it economizes time
and energy. Automatic electric control raises the
car above ground level, furnishes the owner with
a metal identification card, and returns the car
when appropriate buttons are pushed.
A Hot Cathode Sodium Vapor Lamp was demon-
strated in this country recently. A German de-
velopment, it is the most efficient light source yet
made, giving six times as much light for the same
current as the 40-watt tungsten lamp.
absorbing water, then steam pressure is applied,
and, on sudden release, the ore is shattered by the
gasification of the entrapped water. This solves
the problem of crushing and grinding, long per-
plexing the industry.
Platinum has no substitute for many of its uses.
Because of its increasing use in jewelry, electrical
parts, alloys and as a catalyst, a search is being con-
ducted for suitable substitutes. Palladium, iridium
and tantalum are used, to some extent, but plati-
num holds its place as the most important.
The Right Welding Rod is important for a good
welding job. Because of differences in temperature
required for various welds, the proper quantities of
desirable elements must be provided in the welding
rod, to allow for the amounts that would be elim-
inated or changed during the process. Any old rod
won't do.
An Important New Source of Rayon has been
found in bagasse, the refuse left after the extrac-
tion of sugar from sugar cane. Using low-priced
nitric acid, cellulose, the base material of rayon, is
prepared. Because of the large supply of bagasse,
it bids fair to replace the costly wood pulp now
used.
The Flow of Natural Gas through high-pressure
transmission lines has been the subject of study by
the U. S. Bureau of Mines. The results of this study
have revealed many factors which influence the
flow. The complete report is obtainable from the
Department of Commerce.
A Slow Motion Electric Motor for timing pur-
poses has been developed, which, with good bear-
ings, could be made to run forever without atten-
tion. The motor has only four moving parts, and
the reduction of speed is not produced by clock
gears, but by a vernier arrangement of armature and
rotor teeth in the motor.

Shoran Works. Until now these tests have been
impracticable because the "lightning" generator
apparatus has been endangered, but this problem
has been solved. The new method will probably
result in a greater degree of testing standardization.
Air Beacons, for installation on the airways of
the United States by the Chamber of Commerce,
throwing a double beam of approximately 1,1780,000
candle power, are visible for 50 miles, and use a
10000-watt lamp which is automatically replaced by
another one when it is burned out, without any ap-
parent interruption in the beam.
Shearing Stress in Heavy Coiled Springs
like those used under railroad cars, and built
according to recognized standards and formulas,
has been found to be much greater than that ac-
cepted by engineers. The inside stresses were often
two and one-half times as great as those on the
outside where measurements had always been
taken.
"Black Light" is the name given to a new type
of ultra-violet ray lighting for airplane instrument
boards. With the present mode of lighting, stray
light often interferes with the pilot's vision. These
ultra-violet rays are invisible to the pilot, but they
make the radium dials glow with much greater
brilliancy, even in the half-darkness of twight and
dawn.
The Largest Self-Cooled Turbo Generator, rating
100,000 kv-a., 13.8 kv., at 1800 rpni.. is undergoing
unusual tests at the East Pittsburgh Works of
Westinghouse before being shipped for service. As
part of special tests, a set of curves were found
by whose slopes can be figured the telltale "watts
per pound" loss.
Shale Oil Experiments conducted by the Bureau
of Mines and the State of Colorado have led to en-
couraging results. Nitrogen in the crude oil has
been found to lower the cracking temperature. A
quantity of topped N.T.U. crude gave a yield of
65.5% pressure distillate, 29% residue, and 5.5%
coke and gas when treated under 100 pounds pres-
sure at 650° F.
Helium that is 99.96% pure has been produced
in the Cryogenic Laboratory at Amarillo, Texas.
This helium, with only a 2% higher purity than has
been formerly obtained, has given the Akron an in-
crease in lifting power of four tons. Although it
is still in the experimental state, 50,000 cu. ft. per
day were obtained, and the method bears promise
of commercial application.
The Increased Use of Electricity on Michigan
farms is reflected in a report of the Utilities In-
formation Bureau, Ann Arbor, which reveals that
twenty per cent of the total number of farms in the
state are connected with electric power stations, as
compared with four per cent in 1926.
A Theater Switchboard has been designed, using
thermionic tubes, which can be manipulated with
the same ease as a radio set. It provides greater
flexibility than previous designs and more elaborate
and better co-ordination of lighting. Ten scenes in
advance can be set up and changes made by only
one simple control.
A Tight-Wire Measuring Apparatus for deter-
mining the thickness of walls of pressure and acid
equipment at petroleum cracking plants will be
described in a bulletin to be published by the Bu-
reau of Mines. This new device allows the
amount of corrosion of the walls to be measured
without the necessity of drilling holes in them,
which weakens the walls considerably.
A Micropyrometer, said to
determine the melting point
and viscosity of metals and al-
loys more accurately than other
devices of its sort, consists of a
gas-tight chamber; a platinum
strip, 0.0005 inch thick, on
which a test piece is heated
electrically; a microscope for
viewing the beginning of fus-
ion; and an ardometer for reg-
istering temperature.

Fifty Years After—Looking Back
The May issue of nineteen hundred and thirty-two
marks the end of the fiftieth year of publication for
the oldest magazine or newspaper on the campus
of the University of Michigan, "The Michigan
Technic". As we who are the responsible members
of this biennial staff thumb the pages of her his-
tory by reading back through the stacks of old is-
sues which stand proudly in her files we are struck
by the singular honor of belonging to this fiftieth
publishing board. We note with pride that there
have been a long line before us to build up the
heritage to which we have succeeded. Many a
Managing Editor has gone out to make himself fa-
mous as an eminently successful engineer. To
mention a couple which are the first to come to
mind, we find that the present Secretary of Com-
merce, Robert P. Lamont, and the head of the enor-
mous organization of the Dow Chemical Company,
Willard V. Dow, both headed the staff of this mag-
azine and guided her with wise and well directed
reins. Numerous others have piled on additional
traditions until the glorious past seems almost to
overshadow the fondest hopes of the present and fu-
ture.
It was truly a glorious milestone in the history
of engineering education when, back in 1882, the
old Engineering Society of the University of Mich-
igan, recognizing the need of a technical publica-
tion, organized a staff and founded the Michigan
Technic as the first engineering college magazine in
the United States. From then on her days were
fruitful. Starting as a yearly, the book became
more and more popular, advancing to the bi-yearly,
quarterly, and finally to the monthly stage. More
and more students became interested and the staff
expanded its activities to the point where today it
runs school functions and dances, acts as agency
for literature, pamphlets, and handbooks, not
handled elsewhere, and is a controlling and power-
ful factor in the life of the college. The Technic
also pioneered in the formation of E. C. M. A., na-
tional association of engineering college technical
magazines, and was one of its charter members.
Behind this, one can glean numberless other more
detailed activities which add weight to our heritage
and make us ever mindful that we have an ideal to
uphold.
The past lies there in a blaze of glory to look back
at but what of the future? There are undoubtedly
just as many problems ahead as behind and just as
hard. We can only hope that the year and years to
come will bring the solution of the many conun-
drums which the past has shoved head, not know-
ing the answers. We can wonder at a great many
things, conjure up dreams of distant tomorrows,
works out the realization of many an ambition,
and the true spirit of the college, which has so em-
blazoned the past, will assure us of the future.
Our problem is to start the task of making that as-
surance concrete.
We salute the past fifty years. We turn and
face the fifty years to come; the march is on again.

The New Patent Office
Recently a new patent office was opened in
Washington. The improved facilities and increased
staff of the Bureau should result in better patent
service for inventors. It is significant that this
change took place on the bi-centennial anniversary
of George Washington, who showed such keen in-
terest in invention and new discoveries. More sig-
nificant, however, is the fact that the closing of the
old patent building marks the passing of the old
time garret inventor. In his stead, we have a mod-
ern, scientifically, trained research worker, backed
by the vast resources of the great industrial con-
cern.
As we look over the list of early inventors—
Fitch, Whitney, Morse, Howe, Goodyear, Bell,
Edison and others—we see a fearless, imaginative,
self-reliant group of men who worked under the
most trying conditions. With but few exceptions
these men were not connected with the industries
which they so materially advanced. Howe was not
a tailor when he worked out the design of his sew-
ing machine. Whitney was not a cotton grower,
but a Yankee mechanic. Both Fulton and Morse
were artists. Goodyear was an imaginative hard-
ware store clerk, instead of a chemist. And so on
through the list of pioneers.
The day of the lone, struggling worker is past.
Modern industry is too complex for the old type
inventor. Science has progressed so rapidly that
only one well versed in physics, chemistry, mathe-
matics and engineering can intelligently conduct re-
search on some new problem. Invention is becom-
ing more and more a branch of applied science and
engineering. Furthermore, it is very difficult for
an individual to cope with strongly entrenched, in-
dustrially organized research. Germany was the
first to recognize the true relation between inven-
Page Twenty

and made many basic inventions and
discoveries in the coal tar and other in-
dustries.
No longer do we look for amazing
discoveries made by handicapped, semi-
starved, poorly trained men such as
Morse, Howe and others. Instead we
turn to the scientifically trained physi-
cist, chemist, and engineer, sponsored
by industry for new things and im-
proved methods. The passing of the
old patent building is a symbol of the
passing of the old order of invention.

English Requirements Changed
Freshmen entering the College of Engi-
neering in the fall of 1932 will be re-
required to take four additional hours of English
during their first year, which will increase the total
requirements from six to ten hours.
Men in industry everywhere are complaining that
college graduates who come to them, while well
enough grounded in their special technical field, are
sadly lacking in English. To remedy this, the
Engineering College administration has seen fit to
increase the time required to be spent in laying the
foundation of a cultural background.
The world today is beginning to realize the
value of the technically trained mind. More and
more, the engineer is beginning to step into execu-
tive positions. He is no longer considered a mere
mechanic. The man trained in one special field
with too much concentration has no common
ground on which to meet those not in his profes-
sion. Taught the value of English during his fresh-
man year, a student should benefit by it during his
entire stay on the campus.
The new requirements meet with our hearty ap-
proval, and it is to be hoped that those who are
affected by them will realize their sound value.

Opportunities for Undergraduate Research
In the curricula of the college of engineering there
are a number of directed research courses usually
given scant attention by the students, because they
appear to be too complicated and to require too
much work. In these courses, such as E.E. 9,
Ch.E. 12, C.E. 63-65, and M.E. 22, the student un-
dertakes some subject or problem for research and
investigation either in the laboratory or the library
with help and direction from a member of the fac-
ulty to whom he is assigned.
The East Engineering Building—The Home of the Technic
Although these courses look complicated, they
offer several opportunities which can be found no-
where else in the curriculum. First, they involve
the student in work which is more practical than
that which he finds in most of his other technical
courses. They tend to develop in him those quali-
ties of initiative and resourcefulness which are re-
quired for a successful engineering career. Sec-
ondly, the work should appeal to the creative in-
stinct of the student; he will feel the pride of actual-
ly doing something constructive. This will be
especially true, if laboratory work is involved.
Finally, the student has an excellent chance to learn
something about that special phase of his branch
of engineering in which he intends to specialize
after graduation.
The objection still remains that the course re-
quires a good deal of time and energy. This is all
true enough, but it must be remembered that the
nature of the course is such that it makes the ex-
penditure of this time and energy quite natural, as
well as very much worth while. The work will
have a fascinating interest to all those who elect
it, for they can specialize in that field which at-
tracts them most. Because of this intrinsic inter-
est and because of the joy of achievement, the time
spent will not be dull at all, but full of absorbing
work. If, indeed, students exist who are so bored
with their work that they can find nothing to at-
tract them, then research courses are the surest
means of developing the necessary interest.
The training which they afford is so valuable that
every student should elect one of them, even if he
plans to earn only one or two hours credit. The
faculty encourages the election of such courses,
and the faculty member to whom the student is as-
signed is always glad to be able to help him with
his work and to give suggestions. j j g

BAZLEY W. JOHNSON
Dry Studio Photo
SOMEWHERE back in the middle ages, a
Swedish lad from Jamestown, New York, de-
cided that he should go to college and get an
education, thus defeating that age old adage that
some Swedes have a negative amount of intelli-
gence. Engineering appealed to him so he enrolled
in the Civil Engineering course at Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute. From all reports his first
year there was very educational, especially concern-
ing the social side of life. However, a year was long
enough for Johnson to remain in one place so his
next best bet was to come to Michigan. He ar-
rived here with all the sophistication of a sopho-
more, thinking himself distinguished by having at-
tended an Eastern School.
Thus came the pride of the East to a mid-west-
ern center of culture and education, to Michigan, the
so-called Harvard of the West. Here he was to
lay the foundations of his career, to prepare him-
self for what was to inevitably follow graduation.
His personality and abilities were tested in a
hurry by the abruptness of his transformation from
a secluded little college in a small town across the
continent to the bustle and speed of life in a great
university. That he came through with a bang has
been attested to in numerous ways since.
Although his rise to campus distinction has been
almost exclusively wrought in the Engineering
school, we all know that this likeable young man is
very well known on the other sides of the campus.
If we were to mention the sororities too much, we
might be committing ourselves so we will just leave
any explanation of that statement to the good and
wise judgment of you who know him well. At any
rate the kind and venerable Baz early started to
prove that he knew how to get the ball rolling, a
quality which has worried his opposition ever
since.
That first year was a trying one for Baz but as
the end of the year rolled around, he had convinced
SPOT
everyone that he was going to do great things.
When he returned the following fall, he began to
busy himself with campus politics. Of course, this
did not keep him occupied so he decided that the
Technic would reap a great benefit should he give
his attention to such a venerable magazine. The
Editor of said magazine, noticing at once the great
possibilities that Johnson possessed, gave him the
position of Humor Editor. His rise was rapid from
that moment and he was soon appointed Articles
Editor. The members of Triangles, noticing his
many accomplishments, elected him to membership
in that society the spring of that year.
Johnson's vacation during the summer following
his Sophomore year was spent in military training.
He chose Aberdeen, Maryland, as the ideal camp in
which to obtain the training he so desired. Of
course, the rumor goes that Baz did not devote all
of his time to military training.
During his Junior year, he was appointed Man-
aging Editor of the Technic. The magazine be-
gan, at once, to show a distinct improvement over
the preceding issues both in regard to makeup and
general quality. This year saw Baz elected to
Alpha Tau Sigma and Scabbard and Blade. He
ended the year with the completion of his military
training and as a result was awarded a com-
mission of second lieutenant in the Ordnance Di-
vision of the United States Army, Reserve Corps.
Even in his Senior year there had been no let
down. He is now serving as President of the
Transportation Club. It was through his very
earnest efforts that this club was reorganized,
making it one in which every member now takes a
distinct pride. Baz is also a member of the Engi-
neering Council.
It has been said that you will long remember a
man who has left no unpleasant memories behind.
Such will be the case with Baz Johnson. He ha?
perhaps one of the most pleasing personalities of
anyone we know. His reliability is unquestionable;
Baz is always ready to do a favor for anyone. It is
our prophesy that he will be a great success in the
years to come. \Ve will be sorry to see him go
and we know that he will be missed by all his
classmates.

_IGHT
SUFFICE it to say with the current month's
offering on this page we are following the
time honored tradition of taking to task the
high mogul of the recently deposed staff. Thus it
is that we present that bright and energetic young
man from Batavia, N. Y., Dave Hannah.
Dave, it is recalled with pleasure, was a most
satisfactory tryout and displayed a positive genius
in keeping the office dusted by the simple expedient
of always lying down somewhere to sleep. Event-
ually he learned how to maintain his poise while
resting his feet on the Editor's desk, and was forth-
with made the guiding genius in the humor de-
partment. There are those, however, who think-
that this choice was more or less unfortunate, for
the reason that the Editor soon ran up the Blue
Crayon bill in an effort to stem the flow of Dave's
copy.
The staff always derived a good laugh from his
material, despite the fact that good judgment dic-
tated that a lot of it be abandoned before the final
page proofs were made up, and so he was shunted
into the office of Publication Editor for a year.
Such good work did he do here that he was ap-
pointed Editor for his last year on the magazine,
and his crowning glory in this latter capacity came
when, in collaboration with Baz Johnson, he con-
ceived the idea of giving the printers the jitters by
placing the illustrations in the corner of the pages.
The aforesaid Baz and Dave have been insepar-
able pals during their time in school here and
where the one is the other is almost sure to be
found. This mutual attraction has been likened
by some wits to a fly and fly paper, but there is no
information as to which is which. The probable
bond between the two doubtless lies in the fact
that they are both civils.
Dave was made a member of Triangles the be-
ginning of his junior year and the following June
he was invited to join Vulcans. The latter deal
was rather exacting, however, for in the course of
the initiation it was decided that the neophytes
should "crack the whip" for the benefit of the casual
onlookers. The line was formed with the larger
fellows on one end and Dave on the other, and the
whip was cracked in front of the Chemistry build-
ing. Just then Dave chose to leave the gathering
DAVID M. HANNAH
Dey Studio Phot.i
and landed on a rather resistant concrete surface
in front of the library, after a non-stop flight of
some four hundred feet. The wreckage was found
to be fairly intact except for a few square feet of
lost hide, so Dave retired with the rest of the Civils
that summer to Camp Davis in the interests of re-
cuperation.
The summer at camp in the warm sun of Wyom-
ing's western plains did what no amount of Ann
Arbor rain and hard drinking water could hope to
accomplish in replacing this unfortunately lost
hide. Dave's activities on the surveying squad con-
sisted mostly, as we are told by his valiant com-
patriots, in searching the clear blue skies out at
Jackson Hole for the shadows of Mosher Jordan,
the guiding spectre of the Ann Arbor surveying
amateur. The enterprising young man's bad habit
of falling asleep at the most inopportune times
seems also to have gotten him into trouble with
sun burn and other ailments. Survive he would,
though, and returned to Ann Arbor to spend an-
other fruitful year pestering his faithful and long
suffering professors.
The fall term rolled around and the A. S. C. E.
elected him to membership. The Engineering
Council also takes up part of his time, and in his
spare moments he peruses his textbooks.
June will probably be upon this happy, carefree,
young engineer before he knows it and some sunny
day the good Dr. Ruthven will hand him a rolled
up bit of parchment specifying that he attend-
ed the University of Michigan for a period of
four years and said college has at last found that it
can do without said young man. Yes, it surely
looks as though even courses like E. E. 2a can't
succeed in stopping Dave for graduating. Any-
how, we are certainly not going to be the last to
offer him our sincerest congratulations and best
wishes (you may need them Davey, old sock, so
guard your criticisms well). We shall really miss
him when he leaves us this June, for he will leave
many rooters behind.

ORMONO E. HUNT
A HIGHLY satisfactory contribution of the
University of Michigan to the engineering
profession is undoubtedly the very best sub-
ject for review in this fiftieth anniversary of the his-
tory of the Michigan Technic. Of interest not only
to students and graduates of this college but to all
technical men, the career of such a remarkably suc-
cessful man as Ormond E. Hunt can not help but
win admiration and respect from any individual con-
nected with the business world and its activities.
Here is a fountain of the clear waters of experience
and achievement; whoever drinks from it carefully
will receive the benefits to be received so easily. It
is with the utmost pleasure that we continue and set
forth for your careful consideration the story of
the life of an eminently successful Michigan engi-
neer, one of the most valuable men in the automo-
tive interest.
The gentleman whose photo graces this page is
truly a living example of the drift from the farm to
the city and its industrial habits. He was born
back in the good old days before the advent of the
horseless carriage on a pleasant farm in Ionia Coun-
ty, Michigan, near Saranac. Here he was brought
up past the short trousers stage in an atmosphere of
clean air, sunshine, and good hard work. After
graduating from the local preparatory schools,
his ambitions drove him to farther fields and he
entrained for Ann Arbor. Not being ready for
the University, he was forced to serve a two year's
apprenticeship in the Ann Arbor High School.
Then on to college in 1903 and four years of real
study.
As soon as he bid his fond adieu to the elms and
greensward of his alma mater in the year nineteen
hundred and seven, Mr. Hunt wandered off to the
big city, New York, to spend a year and a half
in big time building construction. The first in line
was his acceptance of a position as Superintendent
of Construction for John Russell Pope in New York
City in 1907. The east still claimed our young
and striving engineer in 1908 for we find him now
located in the beautiful capitol city working for the
S. A. Fuller Company on Washington, D. C. In
1909, Mr. Hunt returned to the state of his birth in
order to take over a job as draftsman for the Pack-
ard Motor Company in Detroit.
Appearing to thrive particularly well in home
environments, the new Packard man stuck to his
guns for this corporation for the next nineteen
years. And now we become acquainted with the
versatility and enormous capacity for hard work
and accomplishment which has so characterized the
life of this deserving individual. He rose rapidly
on the Packard scale; for this time on his fate was
sealed as an automotive engineer.
The war claimed his undivided attentions dur-
ing the years of 1918 and 1919 and here again we
note the remarkable success which followed his
energetic labors. His task, specifically, was the de-
velopment of the Liberty motor for use in air-
craft, more particularly for fighting planes. The
fact that he whipped this problem is well known
to anyone at all conversant with America's part
in the "War in the Air". Mr. Hunt's official title
was that of Assistant District Manager for the Bu-
reau of Aircraft Production, assigned to the Lib-
erty Motor. His design proved the outstanding
factor in the War; it enabled the Allied forces to
fight at a par or bette.r against the formerly far
superior Fokker planes of the Germans.
In 1927, we find Mr. Hunt moving his hat rack
from the Packard offices over to the Hares Motor
Company in order to take the responsibilities of
a Vice-President. Finally, late in the same year,
the great General Motors organization called him
and he was made Chief Engineer of the Chevrolet
Motor Company. Again we are reminded that you
can't keep a good man down. He progressed up the
General Motors ladder and ultimately achieved a
position right at the top. In 1929, on December
twenty-ninth, when General Motors appointed a
new set of Vice-Presidents, we find the name of
Ormond E. Hunt occupying a prominent place on
the list. Since then he has served faithfully and
well in a great corporation.
Thus we draw to the close of a great career. We
are proud ,and justly so, to be able to count the
achievements of Ormond E. Hunt as those of a
graduate of our college.

MOST of us are predestined to lead lives of
seeming uneventfulness and placidity, hut
now and again the fates choose to be ca-
pricious and add a colorful air to the careers of
men. Thus it was a queer chain of circumstances
and coincidence that led Prof. Felix W. Pawlowski
from engineering practice in his native Poland to
his present position of Guggenheim Professor of
Aeronautics at the University of Michigan.
Born near Warsaw on July 23, 1876, he com-
pleted his education at the Engineering College at
Mittweida, Saxony, there receiving the degrees of
E.E. and M.E. in 1896 and thenceforward he he-
came engaged in various machine industries in
Europe. About twelve years after his graduation
when he was serving as chief engineer of a Ger-
man firm operating the former Russian part of
Poland came the crisis that was to shunt him into
new fields.
It so happened that during the Russian-Japa-
nese War this industrial district so rich in coal
and iron ore, geographically forming a part of the
ancient Polish Province of Silesia, had seen fit to
stage a rather mild revolution, which was prompt-
ly extinguished by the authorities, and the number
of "secret police" was enlarged to prevent a recur-
rence of the trouble. Eventually, when there was
nothing better to do and in order to justify holding
their positions, these police indulged in a lot of
subsequent "investigations" and saw fit to have
Prof. Pawlowski jailed, despite the fact that he was
entirely innocent of intrigue. Hence it was fortu-
nate for him that at this time his company was in
the midst of an expansion to which his presence was
vital, for the head of the concern was able to secure
his release.
Later, however, when the demands upon him
lessened, he heard that the police were again in-
terested in him and, knowing that the mechanics of
Russian justice were notoriously imperfect, he
promptly packed and left the country for France.
It was at this time that the Wright brothers had
just introduced the art of flying in France at Le
Mans and were shortly to open their first flying
school at Pan. Having witnessed these historical
flights made by the Wright brothers and by their
first pupils, as well as by the contemporary French
pioneers, the Farman brothers, Voisin, Bleriot, and
others, Prof. Pawlowski became interested to the
extent of enrolling in the classes of Prof. Louis
Prof. FELIX W. PAWLOWSKI
Marchis, who in 1909 occupied the first chair of
aeronautics in the world at the University of
Paris. At the same time he built himself an aero-
plane, and mastered the art of navigating it.
This venture was tremendously expensive, how-
ever, and reduced his resources to the vanishing
point, so at this point. Prof. Pawlowski explains
with a smile, his friends advised him to try in
America, where fame and fortune awaited claim-
ants. Hence he arrived in New York in 1910, where
his technical educatian and experience barely con-
vinced the authorities that the four dollars and some
cents in his pockets could be considered as "vis-
ible means of support", and spent the next two
months flitting from job to job. At the end of this
time, however, he contacted the automotive indus-
try and spent something like two years in design
and affiliated work.
This did not diminish his recently conceived love
for aeronautics: hence, in the meantime, he wrote
many universities about establishing courses in this
field. Only two of these definitely encouraged him,
one of them being Michigan, and in January, 1912,
he was offered an instructorship here. His goal
was not to be quickly achieved, however, and he
began his duties teaching in the mechanical engi-
neering department and then, as opportunity pre-
sented itself, design courses in aeronautics. He
also received the degree of M.S.E. in 1914.
As a result of his efforts, in 1916 diplomas were
granted to the first men in an American educational
institution to complete an undergrduate course in
aeronautical engineering leading to a professional
degree. After this time the enrollment in the
courses increased to such an extent that Prof.
Pawlowski was compelled to ask for another in-
structor, and thus was the new department evolved.
Mr. Pawlowski was successively instructor, as-
sistant professor, associate professor, professor, and
head of the department of aeronautical engineering,
before he was appointed Guggenheim professor of
Aeronautics, and his society membership includes

Sigma Rho Tau
Engineer's Forensic Society
Successful years are nothing new to Sigma Rho
Tau and the school year that is almost complete is
no exception, forming another link to add to the
past series of achievements. This society was
formed three years ago for furthering the speaking
abilities of engineering students and has progressed
at a rapid rate under the able tutelage of Profes-
sor R. D. Brackett and other members of the fac-
ulty. Last fall brought forth an unusually large
crop of tryouts, one hundred and twenty-five sig-
nifying a desire to become affiliated with the or-
ganization. Twenty-four of this number success-
fully withstood the rigors of a semester's work in
the society and were initiated early this spring.
This year three intercollegiate debate teams have
again demonstrated that Sigma Rho Tau and the
Engineering College of the University of Michigan
produce real debaters. Those holding at least the
rank of novice are eligible for intercollegiate com-
petition. A large group turned out for these
squads and worked with a will that is best summed
up by saying that they have not lost a formal
debate all year. The principal "bone of contention"
has been "Resolved that the immediate completion
of the St. Lawrence Waterway is feasible". Sig-
ma Rho Tau has put both affirmative and nega-
tive teams on the platform in Detroit and Ann Ar-
bor. Detroit City College and Detroit Institute of
Technology, housing other chapters of Sigma Rho
Tau, formed strong opposition. The affirmative
team was made up of B. D. Schroeder, 33E; E. A.
Kazmark, 33E; R. E. Price, 33E; R. G. Finch,
34E, and J. D. O'Brien, 34E. The negative team
had as its members B. C. Coats, 32E; R. L. Gilli-
lan, 34E; E. L. Fairchild, 32E; D. C. Bleil, 32E; and
J. M. Comar, 33E.
The third debate team defended the negative side
of a question that is daily gaining wider prom-
inence and greater attention : "Resolved that a board
of competent engineers should revise the engineer-
ing curriculum toward more cultural lines." This
squad, composed of the President of the Society, E.
C. Briggs, 33E; W. S. McDowell, 34E; J. R. Doty,
34E, and S. C. Killian, 34E. traveled to East Lan-
sing and Detroit to meet Michigan State College
and Detroit City College.
F. L. Johnson, 34E, brought honor to himself
and Sigma Rho Tau when he captured first place
in the all-campus University Oratorical Contest,
sponsored by the Northern Oratorical League. His
subject was "The Battleship Bubble". He will
compete against winners from six other universities
for the intercollegiate championship.
Sigma Rho Tau itself offers prizes to its members
most adept with an "oiled tongue" and a large num-
ber of candidates are out this spring for these hon-
ors. Prizes are given in three divisions of the field
of speech, namely, Hall of Fame orations, project
speaking, and story telling.
The year's climax is the "Honors Banquet" or as
it is more popularly known, "The Tung Oil Ban-
quet." This year the festivities will be held June 1,
and the guest of honor and principal speaker will
be President Alexander G. Ruthven. Dean Emeri-
tus Cooley, Dean Sadler, Assistant Dean Lovell,
and many prominent members of the faculty will
also be numbered among those present. Honors
awarded will be the Cooley Cane, given to the most
outstanding man in Sigma Rho Tau; the honor di-
plomas, awarded by the Associated Technical So-
cities of Detroit; prizes for the spring contests, and
finally the high honor of the organization, the Sig-
ma Rho Tau key.
Opportunities for Engineering Leadership
The annual Engineering Smoker was honored
this year by being able to present Walter T. Fish-
leigh, an eminent consulting engineer in Detroit,
who spoke on the very interesting subject of possi-
bilities for future graduates in the engineering
world of today. He pointed out with devastating
clearness that there is a pronounced tendency in
modern engineering education to stress the tech-
nical side to the obscurity of the co-ordinating fac-
tors. To avoid becoming mere mathematical robots
and intellectual automatons, the engineering stu-
dents must broaden out the fields of their educa-
tion and learn how to use their knowledge.
An engineering education is one of the most
valuable assets to leaders in any field as it trains
men to know what to do and how to think a prob-
lem through to the correct and practical solution.
The challenge which this experienced man threw
out to the students who attended the affair was a
stirring one. The present depression was discussed
in a manner of hopefulness, although the attitude
of many large manufacturing concerns was criti-
cized severely. Mr. Fishleigh showed that, while
time are good, the big corporation hires thousands
of men and pays them good wages; the executives
pocket the surplus and dividends. Then, in bad
times, these men are turned out jobless in order to

The tear-drop car. A radical automotive design
Cottftfty Michigan Motor Nt
protect the salaries of the big heads.
The technical part of his discussion hit upon a
subject of paramount interest as well as one which
has incited a great deal of discussion and contro-
versy among automotive designers. He explained,
after he had concluded his talk on engineering as a
profession, that he had something else to unfold.
The tear-drop automobile, a picture of which is
shown in connection with this little note, was the
topic which he worked out for everyone's informa-
tion. The main points of the explanation involved
the details of the construction of a body for which
is claimed the maximum of power saving due to
cutting wind resistance to the lowest point. The
entire machine is reversed, which also brought up
an interesting feature; the motor and driving
mechanism is located at the rear while the front
is built for the maximum of clear vision. He con-
cluded by summing up the possibilities in view
here and the many other opportunities which are
ever coming up in engineering as a profession.
His talk was really an inspiring appeal and con-
tributed much of value to the 250 men who heard
it. We can only hope for more as helpful in the
future.
Engineering—Teaching Combined Course
Offered at Michigan
Organized to give training in educational mehods
to engineering students who plan to enter the
teaching field and to provide junior colleges and
other schools with education trained teachers in the
fields of mathematics, mechanical drawing and re-
lated departments, the University of Michigan has
developed a combined curriculum in the College
of Engineering and the School of Education which
enables an engineering student to get a teacher's
certificate in the time taken for the regular course
plus attendance at one summer session.
Under the combined curriculum the student in
engineering chooses a major and minor department
of engineering, in which he may later teach. While
in the junior and senior years in the College of
Engineering he also may take 9 hours of electives
in the School of Education and after receiving his
degree in engineering may complete the remaining
8 of the 17 hours of education required for a teach-
er's certificate by attending a summer session at
the University. Many students in engineering
would like to teach immediately after leaving col-
lege, or after a period of professional practice, but
find themselves handicapped by a lack of the tech-
nique of teaching, says Dean Herbert C. Sadler of
the College of Engineering. The new system will
be a definite aid to such, he believes, as well as
providing junior colleges and other institutions with
men trained in engineering subjects and also in the
science of education.
Davis Highway Library Comes to Michigan
With the placing of the Davis Library of the
National Highway Association at the University
of Michigan by Charles Davis, of Chicago, pioneer
advocate of good roads in the United States, the
University Transportation Library receives in the
collection of 3,000 volumes and 10.000 pamphlets,
the most complete record in existence of the
growth of national and state highway movement,
according to Professor John S. Worley, curator of
the Transportation Library. The Davis collection
is valued at $25,000.
Charles Davis became interested in better roads
in 1910 and organized the National Highway Asso-
ciation in 1912. For years he was the moving spirit
and burden bearer who, almost alone, visualized
the value and convenience of a system of state and
national highways which would make possible the
use of the automobile as a quick and sure form of
popular transportation. Despite repeated discour-
agements he gained advocates and finally proved
to the growing driving public and highway officials
that good roads meant good business and increased
pleasure possibilities. Once the ideal Davis visual-
ized was recognized by the people it gained ground
rapidly until today an improved road makes travel
easy almost anywhere. "It is hoped," says Profes-
sor Worley, "that the use of this collection by en-
gineers, students and historians of transportation
will serve as a constant reminder of the debt the
nation owes Charles Davis for his vision and per-
sistence of purpose."

"This morning I went over to see a new machine
we have at our place, and it's astonishing how it
works."
"And how does it work," he asked.
"Well," was the reply, "by means of a pedal ar-
rangement, a fulcrumed lever converts a vertical
reciprocating motion into a circular movement.
The principal part of the machine is a huge disc,
which revolves in a vertical plane. Power is ap-
plied through the axis of the disc, and work is
done on the periphery, and the hardest steel, may
by mere impact be reduced to any previously de-

Now more than ever before
the Allerton Houses are solv-
ing for the younger business and
professional men and women a
definite problem in New York
living.
Comfort is demanded. A high
standard is necessary. Economy is vital. And so
more and more people, college men and women
mostly, who appreciate these important living
factors are coming to the Allertons.
To men and women with the desire to main-
tain a perpetual high standard of living and
associations, the Allertons offer the facilities and
congenial companionship of a complete, mod-
ern and comfortable club. Yet your privacy is
assured by reason of individual rooms or suites.
Open to each resident are the many public
gathering places reading and rest rooms,
game rooms, gymnasium, private golf clubs
during summer months.
The Allertons are far more than a place to
live. They offer a proven and satisfactory
method of New York living.
Rates: $10 to $22 weekly.

The illogical distribution of
the elements in the city plan
necessitating at least two hours
per day of travel (two months
out of every year) in a motor
car,—racing madly from home to
city after breakfast and from city
to home before dinner, could be
remedied, he believes, by de-cen-
tralization. The blighted areas
are responsible for the necessity
to commute. There is no reason
why communities could not be at-
tractive in and around industrial
areas, and no reason why either
of these must be hopelessly crowded in the already
over-congested metropolis.
The plastic arts too, must be considered in archi-
tecture. Painting, sculpture, metal-crafts, textiles.
and cereamics, all thrive and live intensely only
when the architect is acutely sensitive to their re-
spective possibilities, and creates places for them
in his structural schemes.
It is this essential awareness to beauty that
Cranbrook school tends to develop in its students.
Those who will become creative artists will have
had the opportunity to feel and know their ma-
terial through all its various processes. For those
who are not destined to create, there remains the
responsibility of protecting and patronizing art;
having grown up in an environment so dedicated
to its highest principles these people will inevitably
raise the standards of culture and living in this
country.
Eliel Saarinen is no\v at work on a book. It will
reveal many things of vital interest to everyone
and we are anxiously awaiting its appearance.

and its speeding traffic.
THE DIESEL AIRCRAFT ENGINE
(Continued from page 7)
As a result, the first production engines deliv-
ered, smoked somewhat at cruising speeds and this
was quite pronounced at wide open throttle. As
soon as this was noticed, the top surface of the
piston was redesigned so that its shape was theor-
etically correct. An appreciable increase in power
resulted. This increase in power resulted from
more efficient combustion as a result of increas-
ing the turbulence at the end of the stroke by forc-
ing more of the mixture into the pocket of the
piston during the initial stages of the explosion.
To retain the rated power and speed, 225 H.P. at
1950 R.P.M., the stroke of the fuel pumps was de-
creased approximately 15%. The specific fuel con-
sumption was also decreased about 10% and the
engine is now averaging on test stands and in serv-
ice in the air a fuel consumption as low as .39 to
.41 pounds per horse-power hour at 1700 R.P.M.,
cruising speed; and .46 to .48 at rated power, and
speed.
Only a close examination reveals the difference
in the piston design. The present piston contains
an additional oil ring above the piston to control
the oil flow over the thrust surface more adequate-
These two changes eliminated all smoke from
the exhaust throughout the cruising speeds of the
engine, leaving just a trace of smoke at wide open
throttle which is used only during take-off or in
emergency.
There are several important advantages of the
Diesel aircraft engine. Since furnace oil is used as
fuel, the cost of operation is reduced considerably.
Not only is the cost reduced, but the weight and
volume of oil equivalent to the gasoline necessary
on most engines is also reduced, which increases
the efficiency of the entire airplane. The use of oil
as a fuel also seems to have completely eliminated
the fire hazard in crashes and in accidental breaks
in the fuel line. The elimination of an electrical
ignition system gives one less place for the engine
to go wrong, and makes unnecessary the shielding
of spark plugs, magnetos, and such, which inter-
fere with radio communication.
These advantages are important items in the
successful operation of a commercial air line and
they will bear watching by engineers in this field.

Smith cannot now set up this defense against the
State Bank for the note has been negotiated and this
type of equitable defense is severed by negotiation.
A negotiable instrument, therefore, becomes a per-
sonal property right of most serious import. The
serious effects of carelessly signing this form of
legal obligation cannot be overemphasized.
Essence of a Negotiable Instrument
The law itself is strict in defining negotiability.
These requirements may be listed as follows:
1. An instrument in uriting signed by the obliyor.
While the average business man uses pen and ink
and a good grade of paper, this is not a legal re-
quirement. Writing in pencil is just as effective,
though a very unsafe type of notation.
2. It must contain an unconditional promise to pay
a sum certain in money. The purpose of this require-
ment is to have the paper travel at its face value.
Xo holder of a negotiable instrument should be
in doubt as to its value. Thus, the buyer of an au-
tomobile who signs a promissory note which is
specifically conditioned on the automobile being
satisfactory has not drawn a negotiable instrument.
Any subsequent holder would not know whether
the purchaser of the automobile might some day
set up a defense of unsatisfactory service. Again,
the payment must be a "sum certain in money." A
promise to pay ten cows six months from date
would not be negotiable, for cattle vary from field
to field, and no subsequent holder would know
with certainty the value of the instrument. An I.
O. U. note offers a nice example in this connection.
No bank would purchase an I. O. U. because it
is not negotiable. It lacks the element of a "prom-
ise", and is a mere acknowledgment of a debt,
with no agreement to pay the same. It is true the
paper might be important evidence in a suit for a
debt, or breach of contract, but it lacks the essen-
tial of negotiability,—"certainty of payment".
3. // must be payable on demand, or at a fixed or
dcterminable future time. The instrument must be cer-
tain as to the exact nature of the obligation, and
this requirement must be met in order that the
holder will know precisely when the obligor is
promising to perform.
4. The parties named as payee, or drawee, must be
certain. This is consistent with the general policy of
the negotiable instrument law as illustrated in the
previous paragraphs. It is not essential that the
identity of the payee be known at all times. For
instance, a promissory note payable to the "Treas-
urer of the University of Michigan", three years
from date, might be payable to any one of many
persons. But on the date the note becomes due, the
identity of the official may be determined with cer-
tainty. On the other hand, a note payable three
years from date to the first man to fly to Rome and
return would not be negotiable. It would lack the
certainty that anyone would meet the specifications
within three years. Of course, if anyone should
conform to the requirements, the note would auto-
matically become negotiable.
Holder in Due Course
It is essential that a negotiable instrument pos-
sess a definite certainty as to the promise which
the obligor is making, and as to the monetary
value of the paper at the time of negotiation. It
is equally important that the holder of the instru-
ment be a "holder in due course". In other words,
he must be a bona fide purchaser of the instrument
for value. If any purchaser, for instance, knows
that the paper has been stolen, he cannot subse-
quently set up that he is a holder in due course.
Any other rule would lead to trickery and fraud,
to the injury of some innocent party. The holder
must not only be acting honestly, but the instru-
ment which he is purchasing must appear genuine
on its face. There must be nothing which would
place him on his guard or arouse the suspicion of
an ordinarily prudent person. If the note is past
due when he purchases it, he is prima facie acting
subject to defenses. A holder in due course must
pay a consideration for the instrument. The ade-
quacy of the consideration is not conclusive, though
a grossly inadequate consideration is evidence of
bad faith. In short, negotiability requires that
any holder should come into possession of the in-
strument honestly believing it to be negotiable.
The subject of endorsements, and the responsi-
bilities of endorsers is too extensive for present dis
cussion. It is sufficient to say that any endorser
may limit his responsibility if he makes the proper
restrictions when he signs the instrument.
Liabilities on Negotiable Instruments
All of the equiable defenses are cut off by the
negotiability of the instrument. This is probably
the most important characteristic which the law has
endeavored to establish. It is intended to travel
as currency, free of its past history. But even a
dollar bill passes with certain restrictions. It must
be genuine, and any holder of a counterfeit bill
is immediately the loser as far as the obligor is con-
cerned. The case is the same with all forged obli-
gations, and the law places no responsibility upon
a prudent party whose name has been forged as a
drawer of a negotiable instrument. Thus, freedom
from defects in title of a prior holder is quite differ-
ent from the legal effect of an instrument void at its
inception.

THE HIGH TENSION AIR BREAK SWITCH
(Continued from page 13)
in order to act as an insulating link in transferring
the motion of the operating mechanism to the
switch blade.
Probably the simplest form of gang operated
switch is the so-called "rocker switch", in which the
blade, a short piece of copper, is attached to an
insulator which is rigidly fastened to a horizontal
shaft. This insulator moves in a vertical plane,
making and breaking the contact. The contact is
held by a stationary insulator. Three of these are
usually fastened to a common operating shaft.
All the units illustrated are of the medium
pressure, large contact area type. But since the
current carrying capacity of a contact is not only
proportional to the area of the blade which engages
the contact but also proportional to the pressure
which the contact exerts on the blade, another form
of switch using a high pressure contact has found
a wide use. On this type of unit the blade is rotated
and forced between the jaws of the contact by
means of a toggle. In this way an enormous pres-
sure is exerted on the blade and a compartively
small contact area can be used.
Many combinations of these units are possible
and they are also built in combination with fuses
and other necessary equipment. The manufacturing
companies are kept constantly on the alert in or-
der to satisfy the varied and diverse demands of
the power companies. Single pole switches are
built to almost unbelievable dimensions, a 220,000
volt unit standing nine feet high and stretching out
eighteen feet in length. A 330,000 volt line is now
being considered between Hoover Dam and Los An-
geles and if this voltage is used, the switch manu-
facturers will once more be called upon to display
their ingenuity. A complete range of voltages is
available, many of these switches being manufac-
tured in all standard voltages, which are 7,500.
15,000, 25,000, 37,000, 50,000, 73,000, 90,000, 110.000.
132,000, and 154,000 volts.
A comparatively recent inovation in the air break
switch field has been the introduction of the "rotat-
ing bus" by the Delta Star Electric Company. In
this scheme by ingenious construction, the portion
of the bus on a substation, normally serving as the
cross connection between feeders and busses, is
made of a rotating pipe. On this pipe, switch blades
are mounted. The switch contacts are mounted on
the upper and lower, main and reserve busses, and
disconnecting switches are entirely dispensed with.
The oil circuit breaker disconnects, by-pass switches
and rotating busses are cleverly combined and
built into one another. The by-pass switches and
rotating busses are operated in sets of three while
the oil circuit breaker disconnects are operated in
sets of six, completely isolating the breaker in one
operation. The advantages of the rotating bus are
manifold. First, there is a great saving in insula-
tors, one of the major costs in any air break switch.
Since the usual disconnects are eliminated, the in-
sulators which would be required for them are
eliminated. Two busses are used, a main bus and a
combination reserve and transfer bus. Either the
main or reserve can be used as a transfer. The
two circuits employed in any particular bay can be
by-passed, so as to be entirely independent of the
bus structure, so that even if both main and reserve
busses should be in trouble the two circuits could
feed one another, independent of the bus structure.
The transfer or by-pass feature is secured by a
disconnect switch so constructed as to use the same
insulators that support the rotating pipe. Two ro-
tating pipes are employed in order to make con-
nections with the main and reserve bus, one pipe
supporting and operating blades which make con-
tact with the main bus. The other pipe acts in the
same manner and makes contact with the lower bus,
The flexibility of this arrangement is one of its
greatest assets. The illustration above shows a
large thirteen bay installation of the rotating bus
in southern Ohio.

order to avoid an undue increase in cost of the
cars, due to a more radical departure from the well
established methods of construction. At that, it
becomes possible for the operators to successfully
turn the tables on the autobuses which, hitherto,
have been putting the electric interurban lines out
of business. This is a very striking example of
compromising between some theoretical desirabili-
ties and economical possibilities in engineering
problems.
At this point the writer can hardly refrain from
mentioning that he has had an opportunity, through
these investigations, to meet engineers of two lead-
ing car manufacturing concerns. The experience
was most instructive and illuminating and, among
others, resulted in diverting his admiration from the
generally, and after all quite rightfully, admired
automobile engineers to the railway-car engineers.
Of the sum of $25,000, which the car manufacturer
receives for an interurban car, he pays out two-
thirds to others for the chairs, windows, window
sashes, doors, electric power equipment, and vari-
ous instruments and auxiliaries; then, for the re-
maining one-third, he produces (at a profit to him-
self) a car that will run up to 300,000 miles per
year for more than thirty years. In view of this
astounding performance, many an engineering feat
will certainly fade into the background.
In concluding, the writer wishes to express his
fond hope that this little article, while calling the
attention of engineers of various denominations to
the benefits which they can derive from aerody-
namics in solving quite a few of their problems,
exemplifies, also, the never-to-be-forgotten truism,
—every engineering problem is a compromise problem.
THE TROPICAL JOB
(Continued from page 8)
them, so came back. Later we learned that that
very day they had been killed by a swarm of
eighty nigger bandits. That, however, was an ex-
ceptional case. In general the tropics are safe in
that respect. There are plenty of knives and nickel
plated revolvers about but the natives just natural-
ly lay off of Americans.
With other things it is different. Malaria is
liable to prove a cause of real concern while the
"itch" at times will make you wish you had never
gone down. The bush girls look ugly enough at
first but seem to get a little better every day. It's
a wise man who doesn't stay down there too long
at one time.
Then there is the question of liquor. It may be
a long way from engineering but it has wrecked
many a tropical engineer just the same. These are
side lights that should be considered. They are the
real risks of the tropical job and have ruined better
men than most of us.
I recall one of the boys, a Princeton honor man.
who gave his promise to an old-timer at home. He
was to leave all booze alone for one year. He did
and for so long a time all went well. A year later
he took a boat for the north. Physically he was
badly off with malaria the least of his ailments.
These, with his deep humiliation and the wrecking
of his domestic plans were the price of his two years
in Dominicana.
So I say, when pondering on the tropical job,
consider its broader aspects. You get double pay,
that's true, but its also true that you loose contact
with most of the things worth while in life. You
pick up a lot of tropical lore but the engineering
part is nearly a total loss when you quit the trop-
ical job.

1927, and of articles in various scientific and engi-
neering journals. In these, original contributions
were made on the subject of equalizer theory; the
technique of field mapping; theory of heat and light
radiation and inter-reflection; magnetic circuit
graphical treatment; commutation flux analysis;
commutation; and light court calculation methods.
In connection with the last named, it is interesting
to note that a paper prepared by him and H. H.
Higbie on light court calculations will be one of the
two or three papers from the United States to be
read at next summer's conference of the Interna-
tional Commission on Illumination.
Professor M-oore has been active in various or-
ganizations. He is a member of Tau Beta Pi, was
a member of its Executive Council in 1924, presi-
dent of the Tau Beta Pi Association for two three-
year terms (1925-30), and is at present alumni rep-
resentative of the organization. He is also vice-
president of the Association of College Honor So-
cieties, and a member of Sigma Xi, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, American Institute of Electrical Engineers,
Society for the Promotion of Electrical Engineer-
ing and of the University Club of Ann Arbor.
A POINT OF VIEW TOWARD HOUSING
(Continued from page 15)
Wright, this is no doubt a concession to expediency
since he is working steadily toward housing for
the lower wage scales. But thus far the architect
and the city planner find themselves perforce co-
operating with the economics of profit, and until this
is remedied the cause of housing for those who so
badly need it is not appreciate!}' advanced.
Certain periods in architecture are outstanding

the time, so caught in stone that it defies oblivion
with its high message, though the truth of that
message may no longer obtain. Whether a pyra-
mid-tomb, a mediaeval cathedral or, in our own
time, the materialistic-romantic flowering of the
skyscraper, such milestones of architecture are
magnificent because of their perfect expressive-
ness. But none of these moods carry over un-
changed into the others. The spirit of the Colo-
seum is not that of Rheims. The towers of Manhat-
tan and their attempted emulation in every 100
per cent American city furnish no inescapable for-
mula for the proper housing of the majority of our
population whose incomes fall below the rental
scale of the present housing schemes.
In developing a building plan the architect has
learned to begin with financing for profit. He must
learn henceforth to visualize housing as primarily
an act of social justice, as a wise investment in the
security of our social order. Here is an economy
whose concepts may prove quite as sound as those
of capitalism for profit. It is not a question of
radicalism or conservatism. It is a matter of com-
mon sense recognition of the improbability that a
majority of the population of a rich country are
going to endure continued poverty and squalor.
With a frank facing of the facts we shall have a real
housing movement.
In attacking a particular housing plan the arch-
itect and related technical experts will recognize
such points as those following:
The site will be chosen for a particular class of
workers who need housing, and who require it in a
place convenient to their work. In precisely this
manner are housed the street-car workers in the
great settlements of Berlin-Britz.
To those who need housing it is not a question of
ownership—of the Great American Home. Under
the present regime they can never attain that.
The hopes held out by politicians and industrialists
are the merest mockery. In the urban life to which
we seem committed the poor can only rent, but
there must be something that they can rent.
The rental scale must be set where the lower
wage levels can reach it, from three to five dollars
per month per room.
The detail plan itself must consider orientation
for light and air, privacy and general sanitation,
and the certainty of children. There need be no
luxury, since for this chance at decency and self-
respect the occupants of these coming housing set-
tlements and society in general will come to count
the present world of squalid tenements and six-
room "jerry-built" splendors well lost.
Financing looms menacingly, as always, but it
must not be allowed to dominate on its own terms
as hitherto. It may be a capitalism jolted out of its
complacency, it may be subsidy, subvention by
taxation that will cut the Gordian knot of high-
cost financing. Certain it is that any program
that does not consider its real market, the low
salaried worker, is not housing. Of all the oppor-
tunities the American architect has had this may
prove to be the greatest. For him to bungle it,
for society to evade it, may measurably shorten the
life of our civilization.

At the time Davis began to assemble the liter-
ature of highway engineering there was no size-
able collection of the sort in existence, so that, be-
ginning with the historical aspects, the library now
contains pertinent material from that time to the
present. At present there are approximately 3,000
volumes, 10.000 pamphlets, and 15.000 reference
cards in the collection. The pamphlets, because of
the fact that many are now unobtainable, will pos-
sibly prove to be the most valuable part of the col-
lection, which is conservatively estimated to be
worth $25.000, although the exact worth, due to the
rarity of some of the material, is difficult to state.
Combined with the 19,000 volumes and 60.000
pamphlets already in the Transportation Library,
the Davis collection will give the University of
Michigan the outstanding aggregation of material
on transportation in the world.

gineering department of the University of Michigan

Growing Crystals for Physics Research,
University Specialty
Growing crystals larger and better than nature's
product to facilitate the study of the little known
heat spectrum lying outside the range visible as
light, has become a specialty with the Physics De-
partment of the University of Michigan, whose
products are in demand by other scientific workers
and universities.
The principles involved in the production of
crystals have been known for a long time, states
Professor H. M. Randall, department head, but the
art of producing successfully large crystals free
from flaws has only been successful in recent years
and then only at a few places.
Research on the infra-red or heat waves, whicli
lie beyond visibility on the opposite end of the
spectrum from the much discussed ultra-violet rays,
led to the artificial production of crystals at the
University. Natural crystals of quartz, fluorite and
rock salt were first used and resulted in a very
material extension of the spectrum into the infra-
red region. These crystals, however, were not ob-
tainable in sufficient size. Moreover, they too be-
came opaque with the result that a very appre-
ciable portion of the infra-red spectrum remained
unattainable by these methods of investigation. As
a result the department has found it necessary to

will be transparent to these longer heat radia-
tions.
The largest single crystals so far made have
been cylindrical in form, from five to six inches in
diameter and from four to five inches tall. When
cut and polished these crystals make prisms as
clear as are made from the best optical glass and
transparent over a very much greater range of the
heat spectrum than any glass or natural crystal so
far discovered.
In continuing this work the department hopes
to make crystals of two or three times the size
already obtained, and possibly to discover any ma-
terials transparent to still longer wave lengths
than are these materials. Crystals have become a
subject of ever-increasing interest to scientists and
the department has received requests from a num-
ber of universities for samples of its crystals.
The earlier attempts to grow crystals of soluble
materials were mostly from their water solutions.
As the water was evaporated the materials crystal-
lized out much as sugar crystallizes in syrup. But
these methods, in spite of all precautions, more often
resulted in the formation of an aglomeration of
many small crystals in place of one large single
crystal.
In the present methods the small crystals of
commerce are melted by heat until the entire mass
is in a liquid form. With the materials used at the
University so far this means a bright red heat.
The process of crystallization under these circum-
stances is like water freezing to crystal ice. The
even, slow cooling necessary to prevent the large
crystal from becoming opaque or ruptured calls for
artistic skill on the part of the worker guiding the
process.
S.I.E. Discusses Time Studies
At a recent meeting of the Society of Industrial
Engineers held at the Union, Mr. Van Poppelen, a
Research Engineer, gave an illustrated talk on
"Time and Motion Studies and Their Uses". The
following are some of the points brought out bv
Mr. Van Poppelen during the course of the eve-
ning.
Time Studies are a detail of thorough motion
studies, btit at the same time, the two are distinct
from each other in some respects, principally the
method of approach. To illustrate, the motion
study man sets about to analyze a job, or cycle of
work, with the idea of reducing the operator's move-
ments, and efforts, to a minmum, with the idea that
by conserving the operator's energies, and simpli-
fying the procedure, the operator will have a higher
and more accurate production. In this case, the
elimination of unnecessary motion automatically
shortens the time required for a cycle of operation.

velopment of more efficient methods and equip-
ment.
However, from the standpoint of the time study
man, attention is usually focused upon maximum
speeds and feeds that the operator can handle, and
means of obtaining same to eliminate idle time on
the part of the operator. While this carries with
it some consideration of simplification so as to re-
duce the percentage of idle time to cycle time, the
operator is largely left to his own resources as far
as his own mechanical operations are concerned.
This accounts, in some measure, as to why some
operators, working on a standard task time job,
can reduce the time while others exceed it, in that
more rapid persons tends to unconsciously reduce
and simplyfy their own motions to a minimum.
An example of a practical use of motion study
was cited by Mr. Van Poppelen, in the case of those
departments of the Cadillac Company in which one
operator tended two or more machines. This con-
sisted of a re-grouping of machines to eliminate as
much movement among machines as possible,
changing in many cases from a neat appearing line
layout to the group of machines in small clusters,
which seemed much less orderly, but were actually
more productive.
The following are some of the principles to be
considered when making a motion study:
(1) The working area should be within easy
range of the fingers and so that the opera-
tor may sit or stand normally in an upright
position, and secure material without undue
bending of the body.
(2) A careful pre-positioning of tools will elim-
inate lost or waste motion caused by search-
ing (the search therblig as set forth by the
Gilbreths). A drop delivery is also quite
often effective.
(3) A symmetrically simultaneous operation of
hands, and in opposite directions helps to
maintain the operator's balance and so re-
duce bodily bending. Hence, the ability of
the operator to become ambidextrous is an
asset.
(4) Arrange fixtures or equipment to eliminate
holding by the operator as much as possible,
for the act of holding, while requiring energy,
is not productive.
These principles were excellently illustrated in
four cases. The first was a simple illustration by
Mr. Van Poppelen himself by showing how two
pieces of paper might be more quickly stitched
together. The other three were motion pictures of
before and after of three production tasks in the
Cadillac plant. Two were small, hand assembly
jobs, while the third was an inspection of wrist

was approximately fifty per cent.
Mr. Van Poppelen prophesied that, although so
far no great studies had been made in the appli-
cation of motion study to industry, it was destined
to become an important factor in the future, especi-
ally in plant layout, for, with the development of
the portable motion picture camera, faults could be
much more easily discovered and solved, with the
savings so evident that the art will sell itself. To
date, it is believed that the Cadillac Company is
the only industrial organization in Detroit using
this method, and one of the principal changes in
control there is that now, after a little over a year
of experience, it is the time and motion study offi-
cials who have the final say in matters of equip-
ment layout, rather than the works manager, or
shop superintendent.
Engineering Research—Saving of Metal Losses
A sidelight on the way in which the science
quietly working with complex problems in secluded
laboratories, contributes directly to the progress of
industry and the preservation of our natural re-
sources, is seen in a report of research in the melt-
ing and casting of brass and similar metals, a major
industry which has annually lost millions of dollars
in metal gases escaping up the chimney, or in the
scum of its melting pots, good for nothing but for
the dump heap.
Copper, zinc and lead, melted together into
brass or other alloys, are among the most impor-
tant of metals, serving in thousands of capacities
from automobile parts to bathroom fixtures. All
of them, however, are peculiar in that when at the
high temperatures needed for melting, they are
liable to volatilize off as gas, which escapes up
chimney flues, or to combine with the oxygen in
the hot gases of the furnace, producing large
amounts of scum or dross which finds no end but
the dump. From the enormous tonnage of these
metals melted each year the industry has had to
charge off huge money losses as unavoidable waste.
In the University of Michigan Department of
Engineering Research, a study of this problem be-
gan in 1928, under Professor C. Upthegrove and A.
J. Her/iff, research associate. Hundreds of tests
were made in furnaces in which accurate records
could be kept of temperatures and the kinds of
gases present in the furnace. In alloys containing
high proportions of zinc, the}' found that a scum
or coating of oxidized metal was valuable, since it
prevented the evaporation of the volatile zinc.
Copper or lead are less volatile, however, and in
these cases it was the dross which accounted for
most of the metal shrinkage. Various fluxes, or
melting aids, might be used to control these con-
ditions.

Electric power is doing all the pumping for 300
of the 358 Michigan communities which have pub-
lic waterworks systems, according to a survey just
completed by the Utilities Information Bureau at
Ann Arbor. Electricity is used with steam in
pumping the supplies for 12 additional communities,
in combination with Diesel engines in two com-
munities, with waterpower in one and with gravity
in o'ie. Twenty-eight other communities use elec-
tric power for stand-by and emergency service.
Steam, which once ruled the waterworks pump-
ing field in the state, has been retained as principal
pumping .agent by only 21 communities. Water-
power is used for pumping by seven waterworks
systems, oil engines are used by three, gasoline en-
gines by five, oil and gasoline by one, a hydraulic
ram by one. and a windmill -with electric power
stand-by—by one. (iravity furnishes the supply for
three systems.
The development of interconnected systems
which make power available from more than one
source and the safeguarding of dependability and
continuity of service have aided in the growth of
electrical pumping.
