BENJAMIN DOUGLAS.
Professor C. S. Denison.
Deplore it as we may, in the natural order of events, the
University is called upon from time to time as the years go by to
mourn the loss of some conspicuous son, some man in some de-
partment, who has attained distinction in his profession, or risen
to eminence in the broad field of citizenship.
In the tragic death of Mr. Benjamin Douglas of the Engineer-
ing Class of 1882, which occurred in Brazil, November 10, last,
the Engineering Department in particular, has lost a very promi-
nent alumnus, and those of us who knew and admired him in the
years of his college life and had with reasonable pride and grati-
fication marked his brilliant career as a successful engineer, deeply
lament the untimely ending of a life rich in usefulness and notable
for achievement. Mr. Douglas died at the age of 52 years in the
full tide of professional activity and we are led to wonder what
he might have accomplished had ten or fifteen more years been
granted him.
His death was due to a fall of some 60 feet from a bridge he
was inspecting on the Soro Cabana Railway and was caused by
stepping on a loose plank. All possible aid was rendered, but he
died in a few hours without regaining consciousness. A most
pathetic feature of his death was that he had booked his home
passage and was about to sail for the north in a few days to be
at his Grosse Isle home and with his family at Christmas. The
steamer Lincolnshire brought the remains into New York harbor
on the 23rd of December.
Benjamin Douglas was born December 10, 1859, in Detroit,
Michigan. He was the son of the late Samuel T. Douglas, a


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
leading lawyer of Detroit for many years. His mother was a
sister of Judge James V. Campbell, one of the first members of
the Law Faculty of the University of Michigan and for over
thirty years a Justice of the Supreme Court of the State. Mr.
Douglas's early education was obtained at the country school at
his home in Grosse Isle and he entered the University of Michi-
gan on examination in the fall of 1878. He was of a most studious
disposition and by no means restricted his investigations to the
text-books alone. It is related by Professor Cooley that Douglas
expressed a desire to read Scott-Russell's Naval Architecture and
Shipbuilding, and to accommodate him the three ponderous vol-
umes were brought over from the library in a wheel barrow and
deposited on a specially built reading desk, some twelve or four-
teen feet long, and here on a high stool Douglas sat pouring over
these great books, day after day, until he had read and absorbed
them all. This incident fairly illustrates the deep interest he felt
in his work and his remarkable power for sustained mental effort.
On May 1, 1890, he married Miss Margaretta Biddle of Grosse
Isle, who, with three sons and two daughters, remain to mourn
their loss.
Modest and reserved in manner, he yet possessed a strong
personality and was a man to make himself felt in any community.
His professional life was begun with the Detroit Rridge and Iron
Works, in 1882, as assistant Engineer. In 1885. he was ap-
pointed Bridge Engineer of the Michigan Central Railroad Com-
pany, and with great ability filled this position until appointed
Tunnel Engineer in 1905; and in these twenty years of unusual
activity, in changing, building and replacing bridges over the whole
line, the Company testifies that the work was carried on without
an accident of any kind.
Of the important work executed under Mr. Douglas's charge,
while Bridge Engineer of the M. C. R. R. may be mentioned:
rebuilding of the Grand River bridge on the Canada Division in
1890 and 1891, and putting in a bridge for a second track in 1902.
the strengthening of the cantilever over the Niagara River in
1900, and of the Kettle Creek trestle, Canada Division in 1903.
rebuilding of the Niles bridge in 1900, replacing of all the truss
bridges on the Main Line between 1889 and 1901.


3
The strengthening of the Niagara River cantilever bridge in
1900 was perhaps the most important work undertaken by Air.
Douglas as Bridge Engineer, and one that called for more engi-
neering ability and ingenuity than any other work done by him
for the M. C. R. R. The bridge consisted originally of two lines
of trusses carrying a double track floor. It was strengthened by
building new piers between the old river piers and erecting on
the same a center pair of tower posts and building a complete new
center truss between the old trusses. The work was carried on
without any mishaps whatever and without any interruption of
traffic.
In 1905 Mr. Douglas was appointed Tunnel Engineer for the
Detroit River Tunnel Co., in connection with the construction of
the Michigan Central Tunnel under the Detroit River at Detroit.
This remarkable, and in some ways novel work to which he de-
voted his energies, will ever remain a monument to his genius.
Upon the completion of this enterprise, he took up private and
consulting practice, and in March last sailed for South America in
order to enter upon work for the Brazilian Government. Here
he built several bridges and was engaged at the time of his fatal
accident in inspecting the various bridges of the railroads in
Brazil, for the purpose of making the necessary specifications for
their remodeling to suit modern conditions.
It was in his home life at the delightful old place on Grosse
Isle, that some of his most beautiful traits of character found
their free and ample expression. His devotion to his mother's
happiness influenced him in declining flattering professional offers,
that he might not be too far separated from her in her later years.
After strenuous professional labors, seeking the quiet and retire-
ment of his refined country home, surrounded by his wife and
children, one of America's great engineers said of him, "his life
was ideal." He was an eminent engineer, an honored member of
the community, and in the best possible sense a good citizen.
Mr. Douglas was a member of the American Society of Civil
Engineers, an (associate) member of the American Railway Engi-
neers of Maintenance of Way, member and past president of
Detroit Engineering Society, member of the Michigan Engineer-
ing Society, and a graduate member of Tau Beta Pi.


GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS OF TRANSPORTATION
PROBLEMS.
BY GEORGE A. DAMON, B.S.E.E. '95, DEAN OF THROOP POLYTECHNIC
INSTITUTE—PASADENA.
There are some questions of universal interest and concern—
the transportation problem is one of them. The development of
"public control of utilities," the efforts to introduce "scientific
management" into routine operations and the passing of "contract
ordinances" which limit the operating expenses and specify the
rates for renewals of urban electric railways, are indications of
the general movement toward securing the most adequate transit
service at the minimum cost.
Transportation systems have now passed beyond the period of
exploitation and the chief concern of the management charged
with the responsibility of the most economical operation and the
most effective extension is to secure the proper balance between
income and outgo which will not only provide adequate service
for present demands but will insure extensions and improvements
slightly in advance of constantly increasing needs.
The first efforts of the engineers of our transportation facili-
ties was confined largely to the design and construction of our
steam and electric roads. A large amount of technical effort is
now being expended toward taking these roads out of the specu-
lative field and putting them on a solid financial footing. Engi-
neers are engaged in making valuations, in studying depreciation,
and in determining the fundamental requirements for adequate
service and a protected investment. The entire public utility
world is engaged in one grand house-cleaning and operating meth-
ods and accounts are being put in order to meet the requirements
which general publicity demands.
Engineers are now called upon by municipalities to investigate
transit conditions and prepare reports upon future comprehensive
plans. While these reports are largely upon technical questions
they must necessarily touch upon the financial, political and legal
problems which must be solved at the same time in order to pro-
duce a continuous and constructive transportation policy.


5
Transportation is getting to be the people's business and the
public must know the exact facts. There must be a campaign of
education in which the engineer should take a prominent part, for
his duty is to find the truth and tell it—and in the present political
evolution through which we are passing, the trained technical
thinker has an almost unlimited opportunity. To live up to this
opportunity the engineer must know how to explain his analysis
and how to express his conclusions so that the ordinary layman
can readily understand the subject.
Probably the greatest amount of information can be conveyed
in the most effective way by means of graphical logs. As public
interest in the details of transportation increases there will be a
growing demand for this kind of comparative record of operating
results. With the general adoption of a standard system of ac-
counting these studies will become more valuable to both the oper-
ators and to the public. It is not too much to expect that with the
growth of standardization and of publicity a uniform system of
graphical records will be quite generally adopted.
The possibilities suggested by this introduction may lend in-
terest to a few typical examples of graphical analysis which have
been found useful in the study of the transportation problems of
some of our larger American cities.
In investigating any situation the information disclosed by the
annual reports is of first importance.
Figure I shows the typical accounts of a large street railway
company, first in dollars and then in percentage;—the gross an-
nual income being used as the base in the latter case. The in-
crease (sometimes decrease) in gross earnings year by year and
the variation in the separate expenditures can more readily be
compared by means of such a diagram than by the study of the
corresponding figures, as given in the tables published in the re-
ports of the company. Here we have almost at a glance the record
of the financial operations for eight years. Notice how the earn-
ings increased yearly until the panic of 1907-08 and how the fall-
ing off in income was accompanied by a corresponding reduction
in operating expenses, which however, did not avoid a deficit. The
carrving of this deficit as a floating debt increases the miscel-
laneous deductions from income by the amount of the interest on


7
the deficit; which in turn increases the deficit so that the effect be-
comes cumulative.
The lack of a renewal fund or depreciation account in this
record would indicate that the system is not earning sufficient to
take care of its renewals and the appearance of an extraordinary
maintenance account in the last years of the record would draw
attention to the physical condition of the property.
The diagram graphically illustrates what a serious problem
the transportation engineer must face—and while this particular
case is somewhat unusual on account of the effect of the panic of
1007, the general conditions are similar to those throughout the
country as shown by the next diagram.
The comparative financial records of the operation of the urban
railway systems in ten American cities will be of interest. Figure
2 shows the percentage of gross income required in each city for
operating expenses indicating service, for depreciation or renew-
als, for taxes, for fixed charges and for surplus or in some cases
for a deficit.
This comparison brings out a number of interesting points.
Chicago, with its new "contract ordinance," and Boston with its
supervision by the State Railroad Commission, show the greatest
percentage of the income returned in the form of service—as in-
dicated by the operating expenses and the diagram might thus be
used as an argument for public regulation.
The wide variation in the amount set aside out of earnings for
depreciation by the various companies can be seen and the need
of some uniform rules or practice as to the renewal fund is at
once apparent.
The practice in regard to taxes is another item which follows
110 set rules, varying from three per cent, to nine per cent, of the
gross earnings and the diagram indicates that when the taxes are
the heaviest there has been a corresponding economy in the service
rendered.
The widest variation, however, is in the percentage covering
fixed charges, showing that as yet there is no standard of financial
arrangements. Some companies have financed so as to secure a
low per cent, of fixed charges, while others are carrying such a
burden of interest, rentals and guaranteed dividends as to result

DESCRIPTION OF LOGARITHMIC FLOT.
On this logarithmic section paper, relations between
two variables are plotted in the same manner as on
linear section paper. But hi fhe resulting: plot there
is this difference:—Assuming for example that earn-
ings increase as the square of the population, on linear
paper this relation would result in a gradually ascend-
ing1 curve; on log paper however, it becomes a straight
line with a slope of two to one. And any other data
that plots out with a slope of two to one may be at
once recognized as embodying the square. Similarly
a relation plotting out with a slope of three to one
embodies the cube. etc. Hence it is only necessary to
focus attention on the slope of the lines plotted.
Now in the diagTam two points are plotted for each
city in order to define the average growth during* the
past decade. For the upper point the earnings for the
last fiscal year are plotted with the corresponding1
population derived from the 1910 census. A line con-
necting these points represents the true averag-e rela-
tion between these variables and the slope of the line,
the rate of chang-e as expressed by a power such as
I / :the square, cube, etc. or fractional parts thereof. To
1/ , . j illustrate—If in 1900 there were 1,000.000 people and
$10,000,000 earnings and in 1910 there were 2.000.000
people and $40,000,000 earnings, respectively then the
vertical rise in earnings is twice the horizontal growth
in population, which means that earnings increase
as the square of the population.

in an annual deficit. A comparative study of this kind leads to
the conclusion that the companies which have reached a stable
balance between operating expenses and a reasonable return,
eventually may be used as a standard for the reorganization of
the other systems.
The car mile unit—while not an exact measure—is the most
available under present conditions. In Figure 3 a large amount
of information has been compared—all on a car mile basis. The
records extend over a period of years as indicated by the indices
on the curves and the diagram therefore shows a comparison of
each company with itself and also with all the other systems.
A peculiarity of the diagram is the system of radial lines which
represent "cents per car mile" in which terms the ratio between
the earnings and car miles and also between operating expenses
and car miles arc usually expressed. It will be seen that the "in-
come per car mile" varies from 20c to 29c and that on some sys-
tems this factor is increasing while in others it is decreasing.
These results at once suggest a line of investigation which will
lead us to examine the operating expenses as shown by the dotted
lines and the comparative cost of transportation and power as
shown by the lowest curves. The ratio between the income and
the operating expenses both with and without taxes, as shown by
the curves in the upper part of the diagram will help explain why
some of the roads can operate at a less income per car mile than
can others.
This diagram shows readily the relative size of the various
systems as the gross earnings, the number of car miles and the
total track mileage can be easily compared and in such a way that
the relative growth over a period of years is at once disclosed.
With any given system—the standard of efficient operation
can usually be worked out on a car mile basis and as accounts be-
come standardized this unit can be further defined in terms of the
ton mile and the seat mile.
In prognosticating the future earnings of any system it is in-
structive to know the relation existing between the population
served and the total gross earnings from transportation. From
a study of the census a more or less reliable estimate can be ar-
rived at showing the probable increase in population of any city,


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
but it has long been recognized that the "income per capita" from
transportation grows larger as the density of population increases,
which means that the gross traction earnings increase at some rate
greater than the rate of increase of population.
To investigate the relative growth of population and the
amount expended annually for local passenger transportation, the
annual earnings and population ten years ago and also as of the
last census year (1910) was ascertained for each of the larger
American cities and this information was plotted (Figure 4). In
some cases the record for a longer period than the last ten years
was available.
The use of logarithmic paper enables the comparisons to be
made by straight lines. Upon these lines the index number rep-
resents the exponent of the relative rate of growth, and the dotted
diagonal lines show the relation between population and earnings
when the earnings increase as the square of the population. A
study of the diagram indicates at once that as a rule the earnings
from local transportation increase as the square of the population.
That is, when the population of a community doubles, the trans-
portation income may be expected to increase four-fold. This de-
duction is of the greatest importance in justifying the adoption of
a comprehensive plan of sufficient magnitude to provide for future
transit demand.
The fact that the "riding habit" can be cultivated by supplying
rapid transit facilities, coupled with the fact that these improved
facilities can be operated at a considerable less ratio of operating
expense to gross earnings results in a net earnings per capita
which increases at a rate somewhere between the square and the
cube of the rate of increase of population. This conclusion will
justify transportation engineers in planning for investments in
transit facilities for the next generation on a far more liberal scale
than in the past. Perhaps some day we will learn how to antici-
pate demands rather than withhold extensions and betterments un-
til absolute necessity enforces improvements.

I I
THE FUTURE OF ELECTRIC STREET RAILWAYS, AS
DEVELOPED FROM THE LAW OF GROWTH.
BY J. R. BIBBTNS, '99.
To the student of practical economics no more profitable sub-
ject for investigation exists than the future of the much abused
public utilities and especially those which necessarily operate under
limited rates.—for example, electric street railways. This sharp
line of distinction is drawn here for the earning power of railways
has practically been fixed by the evolution of the industry as de-
pendent upon a maximum 5c fare or less, while other utilities are
blessed w ith the existence of a fair range or flexibility in the rates
for service they may impose without materially affecting their
business.
I have characterized the public utility as "much abused" which
is possessed of a dual meaning. There is no question about the
existence of ill-treatment—much of it from an unreasoning public
unlearned in the difficulties of successful operation and the risk
encountered in the erection of the financial structure. But, at the
same time, much can be justly laid at the doors of unscrupulous
commercial methods of these same corporations that are crying
"wolf, wolf"—which have deliberately discounted the future with
their eyes open,'the while making no provision in their balance
sheet for buying a new broom when the old one is worn out and
only listening with childish delight to the falling of the golden
drops as they "squeeze the sponge" till it is—dry.
We hear much in glorification of optimism in business devel-
opment and it has been the approved custom in the days of our
impressionistic youth to deify those great "captains of industry"
about wdiose sacred persons and omiscient minds a golden halo
has played, in our imagination, by degrees enlarging its saturnine
splendor as the apparent magnitude of financial operations increas-
ed by leaps and bounds. The very stupendousness of these opera-
tions seemed to carry some magic security against possible fail-
ure—a talisman for all ambitious men.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
But, alas! Not infrequently it occurred that our demi-gods
proved to be bigoted Goliaths to be brought down by the little
stone of Reason. And behold the ruins! Nothing in our amazing
commercial development so schocks the mind trained in that school
of right-thinking which pre-eminently marks the men of the pro-
fession of engineering as the fatuity of "high finance." In plain
terms it is financial greed run riot. There has been too much fi-
nance and too little engineering.
These men undoubtedly possessed an overmastering faith in
the "Future." Thus far they are to be commended and were cor-
rect, but their vision lacked the balance-wheel of reason. Not con-
tent with a fair return on the investment, profit-taking became a
sportive and engaging occupation. Contrast this with the careful
and conservative management of parallel industries which today-
stand rock-ribbed against any and all assaults of financial or other
disasters. There are many examples in this same field, where op-
timism has brought its logical reward.
The most wonderful phase of this situation is that the "Future"
so-called, has even exceeded the most sanguine hopes of the op-
tomist, so that the many pages in the book of History should have
been less sorrowfully decorated than they are. But it is indeed
pleasant to find recorded a Future which ought to inject courage
into a lagging industry. Briefly, I refer to the earning capacity
of public service utilities and particularly street railways. In set-
ting about to investigate the growth of the riding habit in the
larger cities of this country the most important factor involved
and the fundamental one was obviously growth in population. It
seemed there should be a law expressing the relation between these
quantities, i. c., the "riding habit," and with the aid of logarithmic
paper a very apparent one was quickly developed,—a linear rela-
tion on logarithmic coordinates corresponding to an exponential
relation on rectilinear coordinates.
Taking the case of a moderate sized city—Providence R. I.—
the plat, Figure I,1 tells the story and needs no comment except
that the law has been investigated for a period of twenty years
back covering periods of both horse car operation and, for about

ed elsewhere by another author in discussion of other phases of
this subject, covers a period of ten years only, which in the case
of most large railway systems represents the period of normal ser-
vice expansion under electric motive power. It is comforting to
find as small a city as Providence approximating the same rate of
growth as the larger ones.

We gather from these studies the fact that in the majority of
cases the gross earning power increases not as fast as the increase
in population served, but about as the square of the latter. This
is equivalent to saying that the riding habit,—earnings per capita
—increases at the same rate as the increase in population. A
physical analogue of this phenomenon may be found in the grad-
ually enlarging waves from a stone thrown in a pool. As the
jKipulated districts expand the radial traction lines embrace the
entire area, increasing as the square of the distance.
This law has been proved conclusively in one other case—a
middle-west city—which is of exceptional interest in that the law
is maintained even though the average revenue fare is well below
5 cents. In other words, the average man is limited in his riding
habits only by his purse, and that the cheaper fare will not result
in a proportional loss of revenue to the corporation. In the light
of present agitation towards fare reduction this very general state-
ment is interesting.
Finally, the best concrete conception of this relation is to be
had from figures. The riding habit of most of the cities is about
200 rides or $10.00 per capita per year. By the time the popula-
tion has doubled, the riding habit will approximate $20.00 per
capita per year. Then if a street railway property now earns
$5,000,000 per year, we should expect not $10,000,000 but $25,-
000,000 at the time of doubling of tributary population. The full
import of these facts can hardly be realized at first thought,—it
is only necessary to point to New York City and Chicago as hav-
ing both experienced this rate of growth; Chicago has even ex-
ceeded it in spite of the rapid growth of population.
To return then to our introductory premises it is apparent that
here is food for thought for the student of engineering economics
and also for the corporation financial promoter. One has no quar-
rel with the latter's cupidity for we are all afflicted, but one does
object to his plaintive cry for inordinate profits on account of
imaginary risks involved—in this case risks of his own manufac-
ture. Under culture by the careful and efficient husbandman, the
golden harvest ripens apace.

INTRODUCTION TO THE THEORY OF WATER TUR-
BINES.
S. J. Zowski.
I. FORMS OF AVAILABLE ENERGY AND ITS UTILI-
ZATION.
A body weighing W pounds and moving with a speed of c feet
per second represents an energy- of
mc* W &lt;r2 , . ,
— — foot pounds.
2 g 2
in — WJg is the mass of the body.
A waterstream carrying Q cubic feet per second and moving
with a speed of c feet per second represents an energy of
E = ■ — foot pounds per second. (i)
g 2
Hereby is y the weight in pounds of one cubic foot of water.
7 = 62.352 (at 6o°F).
The speed attained by a body falling through a vertical height
of // feet is
c = V2 gll
.. // = -
Substituting this in the formula for 11 we obtain for the energy of
a waterfall having a height or head of H feet and a discharge of
0 cubic feet per second the simple expression
E = yQH foot pounds per second. (2)
A water column H feet high exerts on the bottom a pressure
of p — yH pounds per square foot, or, putting it in other words,
a pressure of /&gt; pounds per square foot is equivalent to a head of
feet water column.
7
Consequently then, a water stream carrying 0 cubic feet per sec-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
ond under a pressure of p pounds per square foot represents an
energy of
E = yQ —=Qt&gt; foot pounds per second. (3)
7
The energy contained in moving or falling water may then, as
we see, appear, be measured and expressed in three different
ways: namely, as level difference, pressure and speed, or, in
other words, as geometric head H, pressure head p/y and speed
head c-/2g.
The primary form of a natural water power is always a level
difference: a waterfall of a certain height or head H. Pressure
and speed are secondary forms, caused by the first. We shall
therefore find that the general practice in stating the amount of
an available water power is to give the discharge Q and head H,
although often times the available head can be ascertained only
by measuring the pressure and the speed of flow.
The power of a waterfall in HP is
55o 8.8 w
Units: cubic feet per second for Q and feet for H.
To utilize an available water power various types of water
motors have been proposed and are being used up to the present
time. Most important of all arc the water turbines, both on ac-
count of their superior efficiency and better adaptability to the re-
quirements of modern power developing stations.
It is, of course, impossible to make the entire energy which
is stored in a waterfall useful, as various losses occur. The mere
fact, for instance, that the water is flowing causes unavoidable
losses of energy, collectively known as friction losses, which are
due to the viscosity of the water, the skin friction and the resist-
ance of obstacles found in the path of the stream. It is beyond
the scope of this article to discuss any further these or the other
losses of energy, their causes and remedies, but one quite char-
acteristic loss shall not be left unmentioned at this place, namely
the s.c. discharge loss.
Tn order to detract from a moving body its entire energy we
have to bring this body to a rest at the end of its passage through
the energy detracting machine—the turbine. This however is


'7
impossible with continuously running water, as after it reaches the
lower level, the s.c. tail race, it must be carried away, if the orig-
inal level difference, constituting the source of pow;er, should be
maintained. The water must therefore have a certain speed at the
end of its passage through the turbine, and thus a certain energy
must be allowed to escape harnessing.
Even with a perfect fluid and a perfect turbine it is therefore
theoretically and physically impossible to turn the entire available
energy into useful work.
The harnessing of the energy stored in moving or falling water
by means of a water turbine is based on the following funda-
mental laws of mechanics.
I. To deviate a moving body from a straight line path a force
must be applied, acting upon the body in the direction towards the
center of deviation. This force is known as the centripetal force.
II. A body upon which a force is acting in a certain direction
will react with the same force in the opposite direction. In the
case of a deviated body this force is called the centrifugal force.
Letting then, as we do in water turbines, the water flow
through a number of curved channels, usually called buckets,
which are connected to a revolving shaft, we shall deviate the
water, the rigid buckets furnishing the centripetal force acting in
direction towards their centers of curvature. To this force the
deviated water streams will respond with the centrifugal force
acting in the opposite direction and therefore pressing upon the
buckets. If now the buckets are allowed to yield to this force of
reaction, as the centrifugal force is usually called in connection
with deviated fluids, and to move around the shaft with which
they are rigidly connected, we apparently obtain mechanical work,
having its two constituents, viz., force and speed. This work is
collected on and transmitted through the revolving shaft to a point
where it may be taken off conveniently. This is done usually by
an electric generator, transforming the mechanical work into elec-
tric current.
2. CONTINUITY OF FLOW.
Let Q cubic feet per second be the quantity of water which
at a certain instant passes through a given cross section of a ves-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
sel occupying this section entirely, then the speed of flow at this
point is
c = feet per second.
A
if A is the area of the cross section in square feet.
Assuming that the water fills the vessel entirely, not only at
this but also at any other section and that the water is incompress-
ible and the material of the vessel inelastic, then the same quan-
Fic. i.
tity Q must pass through each section, at the same instant. If
therefore, Ay is the area of the cross section at point i, and
at point 2, r, and c2 being the corresponding speeds of flow, (see
Fig. i) the following equations are fulfilled:
A,c, — AzCi Ac = Q = constant.
_ A3 c, _ Ac
or: l~~AT~ A, , .
2 At At
These are the simple mathematical expressions of what is
called the continuity of flow of incompressible fluids flowing
through inelastic vessels. As a matter of fact, no fluid is incom-


19
pressible and no material is inelastic, and it is therefore possible
that even when the vessel is filled with the fluid entirely an accum-
ulation due to the compression of the fluid and expansion of the
passage area takes place, what in turn would mean that not the
same quantity passes through all sections at the same time. These
phenomena however occur only when the flow is variable and need
not to be taken into consideration in the theory of water turbines,
which naturally is based on uniform flow. With uniform flow
the above continuity equations hold true also for compressible
fluids passing through elastic channels.
Only problems connected with the regulation of water tur-
bines and the therefrom resulting surges in the conduits through
which the turbines are supplied with water, the phenomena caused
by the compressibility of water and elasticity of the conduits must
be taken into consideration. The continuity equations, as given
above, could not be used in these problems.
3. ASSUMPTIONS.
1. Stable conditions prevail, i. c, the speeds are no functions
of the time.
2. Continuity of flow prevails and is expressable by the equa-
tion
Ac — Q = constant.
3. Speeds of flow and pressures are equal over the entire
cross section taken into consideration. This virtually means that
the water streams are replaced by their mean water flow lines or
that the channels taken into consideration are of infinitely small
cross section.
4. The units used are the foot, square foot, cubic foot, the
second and the pound.
4. BALANCE EQUATIONS.
A. Water Flows Through Stationary Channels.
Let the passage area of the stationary channel shown in Fig. 2
be Ax at point 1 and A„ at point 2 and the corresponding speeds
and pressures be ct, c2 and pu p„. Point 1 be H1 feet and point 2
be H., feet below a certain given water level. The vertical distance
between 1 and 2 be H = H„ — Ht. The head lost by friction be-
tween 1 and 2 be Ht.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Take into consideration any particle having the area A and
the infinitely small thickness dl, and thus a mass m = A dly/g.
Let the speed of this particle be c, its direction being desig-
nated by the angle &lt;f&gt;. The forces acting upon the particle are:
1. On top a pressure p pounds per square foot giving a
force in the direction of flow of
+ 1&gt;A pounds.
2. On the bottom a pressure /&gt; + dp pounds per square foot
giving a force acting in the direction of flow of
--(/&gt; + df) A pounds.
3. The weight of the particle Adly acting vertically down-
ward and giving in the direction of flow a force
+ Adly cos &lt;P pounds.
4. Opposing the flow the frictional resistance acts with a
''friction head," dHt, giving in the direction of flow a force
— Aydll, pounds.
Perpendicularly to the path of the particle the force of devia-
tion—i. c, centripetal force mc2/p is acting whereby p is the radius
of the curvature of the path at the point considered. This force.


21
however, being perpendicular to the path will have no effect upon
the motion of the particle in its instantaneous direction of flow.
The resulting accelerating force acting upon the particle in direc-
tion of motion is therefore
F = Ap + Adly cos &lt;t&gt; — A (/&gt; + dp) — AydH,.
= Adly cos &lt;t&gt; — A dp — AydHr
But dl cos &lt;t&gt; = dH see figure 3.

This is the general differential equation for the flow of any
fluid through a stationary vessel—under the action of the geo-
metric head H, the pressure head p/y and the friction head Ht.
For water we may assume that y = constant (incompressibil-
ity of water). This makes the integration very simple.
Ci H,. j&gt;2 Hf
Ci Ht pi o


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
This equation is the mathematical expression of what is known
as the theorem of Bernoulli, with the frictional resistance taken
into consideration.
Neglecting the friction head Ht, as this was done in the orig-
inal theorem, we may interpret the equation as follows:
Any changes in one form of energy must be accompanied by
equivalent changes in the other forms. Thus, the change of speed
energy (c.,2— c^) /2g is due to and at the same time cause of an
equivalent change in the energy represented by the geometric
head, H„ — Hu and by the pressure head (p2 — pt)/y. For our
purposes it will be more convenient to write the equation 7 in the
following way:
ci/29 + p-:/y = cchg + f:/y + H-H,. (8)
Interpreting this equation we may say: The energy contained
in one pound of water at point 2, in form of speed and pressure
c2-/2g -f- p.Jy is equal the energy contained in one pound of water
at point 1, in form of speed and pressure c2/2g -f- p1/y plus the
energy added by the fall of the water from 1 to 2, which, per
pound of water is equal the geometric head H, minus the energy
lost by friction between point 1 and 2, which, per pound of water
is equal the friction head H;. The equation gives us an account of
the available, gained, and expended energy in exactly the same
way, as does the balance of a business transaction. We shall there-
fore call equation 8 the balance equation for the flow of water
through stationary channels.
1!. Water Flows Through Channels Moving, with Uni-
form Speed on a Straight Line.
Let us assume now that the channel Fig. 4 is moving with uni-
form speed v rectilinearly, while the water flows through the same,
as before. Instead of c, and ra let us call now the corresponding
speeds of flow u\ and u'.,, in order to make it apparent that now
we take into consideration the relative speeds of flow. We shall
use the letter c for real speeds of flow (relative to the earth), the
letter w for the relative speeds of flow (relative to the moving
channels) and the letter v for the speeds with which the channels
move.


2 3
As a uniform straight line motion does not set up or require
any additional forces, the balance equation for the relative flow
: i
through our channel must apparently remain the same as that for
the flow through a stationary channel.
We may, therefore, write:
w,'/2g + p,h = w.720 + pJl + H— H,. (9)
C. Water Flows Through Channels Rotating with Uni-
form Angular Velocity.
The theory of curvilinear motion (see law I and II given in
paragraph I) teaches that a body having the mass m and moving
on a circle of radius r with an angular velocity «&gt; or a peripheral
velocity v — r&lt;o exerts a force, the so-called centrifugal force,
C — mru? = mif/r
acting radially outward.
If therefore the channel through which the water flows is ro-
tating we must take this centrifugal force created by the rotation
into consideration as an aditional force acting upon the water
particles and affecting their motion through the channel.


For simplicity let lis assume that the plane of rotation is hori-
zontal, and that the channel is symmetrical around this plane of
rotation. This eliminates the geometric head H between points
I and 2 but docs not affect the problem in a general way.
Take into consideration a particle of the mass Adly/g located
at a radial distance r feet from the axis of rotation, then the forces
acting upon this particle are: In the direction of the flow A p. In
the opposite direction A(p A- dp) and Aydfl,.
Radially outward the centrifugal force

d^ll. ru* cos o
g
acting in the direction of flow.
Perpendicularly to the path of the water in the channel the
force of deviation is acting, having no effect upon the motion of
the particle.


25
The resultant accelerating force, acting upon the particle is
therefore
F = .r»&gt;* cos &lt;P + Ap —A (p + dp) —AydH,

cos&lt;/&gt;= iL.

By substitution we obtain:

Integrating between the two points 1 and 2 we obtain, with y as
constant, 1
= — \rf-r{) - Et^B _ H, (11)
2g 2g 7
This is the general equation for the flow of water through ro-
tating channels. It is the extended theorem of Bernoulli, consid-
ering also the effect of rotation.
Substituting v.r for r22&lt;o2 and vt2 for &lt;o2 we may write the
above equation also in the following form:
+£t_ =Eil + J± + - pi* _ Ht (12)
2g 7 2g 7 2g
This is the balance equation for the flow of water through ro-
tating channels, the rotation being uniform and there being no geo-
metric head between 1 and 2. If there is a level difference be-
tween these two points, this will of course be a "gain" during the
passage from 1 to 2 and must be "booked" in the balance equation


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
as positive quantity—assuming that 2 is below 1. Thus the gen-
eral balance equation for flow of water through any channel which
has point 2 H feet below point 1 and rotates around an axis with
an angular velocity « = vjr^ = vt/rt is:
3g y 2g y 2g
+ H—Hf
(13)
In comparing this equation with that of the flow through rec-
tilinearly progressing channels, we shall notice that the only dif-
ference is the item -f- (v22 — v*) /2g, which expression reminds
us, at once, of the theory of the rotating water paraboloid. See
Fig. 6.
Water contained in a rotating vessel assumes a parabolic
level, so that the level difference between point 1 having a peri-
pheral speed and point 2 having a peripheral speed v.t is
W — Vt')/2g.
Remembering this the interpretation of the equation 13 be-
comes again quite simple, viz:
The energy at the end of flow (point 2) wt*/2g -)- p2/y is
equal the energy, which -was available at the beginning of flow
(point 1) namely w*/2g-\- pjy plus the energy created by the
rotation in form of level difference (or pressure difference)
(v* — v*)/2g plus energy gained by the fall H minus energy
lost by friction H,.
■Hi


27
So far it was silently assumed that the direction of flow
through the channel is away from the axis of rotation and that
therefore, the centrifugal force acting also away from the axis is
an accelerating—hence positive force. Let us now turn the chan-
nel so that the flow is towards the center, but let, as before, 1 indi-
cate the point from which and 2 indicate the point towards which
the water flows, thus making r, or vx larger than r2 or v„.
Fig. 7-
This makes the centrifugal force a retarding force, so that in
the differential equation 10 we shall have now —vrrdr/g instead
of + »&gt;~rdr/g. Nevertheless the final formula will remain un-
changed, due to the fact that r, being now larger than r2 we must
integrate the expression—rdr between r, as the higher and r, as
the lower limit and
rt r,
as it was before.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The balance equation 13 holds therefore both for inward and
outward flow, if point 1 is ahvays the point of entry into and point
2 the point of discharge from the channel.
5. REACTION OF A DEVIATED WATER STREAM.
The energy stored in a water fall is, as was stated before, har-
nessed by letting the water flow through rotating curved channels
and by thus obtaining a force pressing against the channels. In the
theory of curvilinear motion this force is called the centrifugal
force but in reference to fluids the term force of reaction of a devi-
ated water stream is used most commonly. In the special case of
a sudden deflection the term impact is often used.*
Although the rate at which the deviation takes place has no
bearing upon the theory of reaction, yet for the discussion of sev-
eral problems it is more convenient to make a distinction between
the gradual and sudden deviation.
A. Gradual Deviation of a Water Stream.
1. force of reaction.
(a) Stationary Channels.
Let cr be the speed of flow at point 1 of the channel where the
deviation begins to take place. The direction of ct is thus tangent
to the channel at point 1. Let ^ be the common angle of cx and
the channel at point 1 measured as shown. As the water flows
through the channel the angle &lt;f&gt; changes gradually (increasing
in our case) and reaches the value &lt;f&gt;2 at point 2, where the devia-
tion is completed and the stream leaves the channel with the
speed c.2.
* It is to be regretted that the word "reaction" which has a much
broader meaning in general mechanics, has been given this special mean-
ing in hydrodynamics. More yet is to be regretted the fact that some
writers have gone still further and use the word reaction only when the
water flows through and is deviated in closed curved channels under pres-
sure, whereas for a pressureless flow, such as we have in open channels
the word "action" is used. The introduction of these two words "action"
and "reaction" into the theory and commercial literature of turbines and
giving them the above specific meaning causes a great deal of confusion
and creates misleading conceptions as to the very fundamental laws upon
which the turbine theory is based.

Let us take into consideration any particle between point 1 and
2 of the mass m — Adly/g. Let p be the radius of curvature of
the path at this point, let c be the speed of flow and &lt;f&gt; the angle,
measured in the same way as ^ and &lt;/&gt;„. In order that the final
equation be an expression of the force of reaction alone, undis-
turbed by the force of gravity, the assumption is made that the
plane of drawing in Fig. 8 is horizontal. Although hereby the geo-
metric head and thus one of the accelerating or retarding forces
is eliminated, this will not affect the general validity of the fol-
lowing deductions, for, whatever forces be acting, they will dis-
appear from the equations being expressed by the accelerations
which they produce.
If due to any forces the particle of the mass m is accelerated
at the rate dc/dt, then the force acting in the direction of flow
is m dc/dt.
According to the law of action and reaction the particle will
react with the same force in the opposite direction. Thus we ob-
tain as the first force of reaction F = m dc/dt, acting in a direc-
tion opposite to that of flow (acceleration being assumed as posi-
tive).


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Besides f, which often becomes zero (channels through which
the water flows at uniform speed) there is another force yet to be
considered, and as a matter of fact this is the primary force of
reaction. This force is obtained due to the two laws given in
paragraph i. If, namely, p is the radius of curvature of our chan-
nel the particle will press against its wall in the direction azvay
from centre of curvature with the force C = mc2/p.
Resolving now F and C into their horizontal or X-components
and their vertical or Y-components we obtain for the X-compon-
ent of reaction of our particle = F sin &lt;f&gt; + C cos &lt;p acting in
the opposite direction of theX-component of speed c, and for the Y-
component of reaction dR, = F cos &lt;f&gt; — C sin acting in the op-
posite direction of the Y-component of speed c. The positive X
and Y axes have the same directions as the X- and Y-components
of the speed c.

Integrating between the limits c, and c2, and &lt;f&gt;2 we obtain
for the X- and Y-components of reaction the following equations:
Rx — — (fj sin &lt;j&gt;2 — c 1 sin &lt;4,)
yQ {IS)
Ry = (c2COS&lt;b2— CiCOS&lt;t&gt;i)
The item c2 sin &lt;f&gt;2 — r, sin &lt;f&gt;l is the total change of the X-com-
ponent and the item c„ cos cf&gt;2 — cx cos &lt;£t is the total change of the
Y-component of the speed of flow. Thus the main law of reaction
may be stated as follows:
I. The components of the force of reaction of a deviated
water stream depend on and are in direct proportion to the quan-
tity of water deviated per second and the total change of the cor-
responding speed components.
The rate of deviation, radius p, has no bearing upon the final
formula, neither the forces acting upon the water, although pri-
marily these forces are responsible for the force of reaction, the
speed changes being caused by them.
Taking, for the sake of further discussion, the for the water
turbine most important X-component into consideration we
shall see at once that with the same discharge we may obtain
the same results in many different ways, as we may let both
the speeds and the angles vary in many ways and still obtain the
same values for c„ sin &lt;j&gt;2 — c1 sin fa.
Let for example ct — 2o feet per second and &lt;£2 = 6o°. Let
in one case c be accelerated from cx to c2 = 40 feet per second,
whereby &lt;^1 = 2o°, and in the other case c remain constant, thus
c, = cx = 20 feet per second.
Then in the first case we obtain
Rx = ^ (40 sin 60 — 20 sin 20) = 27.8
g g
If now the same value for Rx should be obtained also in the sec-
ond case, we must have
?Q (20 sin 20 — 20 sin o,)
g
making
^ = -31° 40'.


The two channels would be about as shown in Figs. 16 and 17.
In the first case, where the water is deviated and accelerated,
the deviation is much smaller than in the second case, where the
water is only deviated. The total deviation is 6o° ■—200 ==40° in,
the first and 6o° — (— 310 40') = 910 40' in the second case; yet
both channels will produce the same force of reaction. Therefore
in addition to the main law of reaction the following laws should
be remembered. •
II. The deviation alone, i. e., change of direction of flow is
not a sufficient criterion for the force of reaction but the deviation
and speed change.
III. It is possible to obtain the same force of reaction by sim-
ply deflecting as by deflecting and accelerating.
IV. If the water stream is deviated only, the deviation must
be larger than if the flow is also accelerated.
The equations for Rx and Ry may be derived also in the fol-
lowing way.
Resolve the speeds of c, ct and c2 in their respective X- and
Y-components. Then, if the acceleration due to forces acting
upon the particle of mass m is dcjdt in the direction of the X-


33
component and dcv/dt in the direction of the Y-component, there
must be acting upon the mass a force which has the following
components:
. dcx
m^-±- in direction of c*.
at
m *!fu in direction of Cr.

According to the law of action and reaction therefore the two
components of reaction are:

(i&gt;) Channels arc moving on a straight line.
Assuming now that the channel moves rectilinearly with uni-
form speed v while the water flows through the same with a speed y~J(J
changing from wt to wx, then the equations for Rx and Rr will re-
main unchanged, as uniform line motion does not set up or re-
quire any additional forces. We have, of course, to substitute
the relative speeds u\ and xv2 for the real speeds cx and c2. Thus,

2. MOMENT OF REACTION.
(a) Stationary channels.
Let us now imagine that the channel 1-2 is rigidly connected
to a hub which may turn around the axis O, the origin of our co-
ordinates. The forces of reaction RK and R, will then produce a
turning moment Mr called briefly the moment of reaction, due to
which the channel will have the tendency to rotate around the axis.
Let us first assume that the channel is held still, then, taking
into consideration a particle of the mass m = Adly/g located at


&lt;33
point (x, y), we know that the two components of reaction press-
ing against the channel are:
dBr = ^ . d (c sin $)
g (*9&gt;
dBv = . d (c cos &lt;f )
g
ftp A3
The turning moment, produced by this particle is therefore,
(taking the moment dRx as positive):
dM n = dR*y — dR,x
= [y d (c sin o) — x d (c cos o) )
g
But
yd(c sin &lt;t&gt;) — xd{c cos &lt;t&gt;)= d(xc s'm&lt;P — xc cos &lt;t&gt;).
Proof:
d (yc sin * — xc cos = c sin 0 &lt;iy + yd(c sin &lt;#&gt;) — c cos &lt;p dx — xd (c cos &lt;py

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Cancel therefore c sin &lt;j&gt; dy — c cos &lt;j&gt; dx in the first equation of
this proof and obtain
d(yc sin $ — xc cos &lt;!&gt;) = yd(c sin &lt;P~)— xd(c cos &lt;t&gt;).
Substitute this in the equation for &lt;/MR and obtain
dMa. = 22. . d (cy sin &lt;fi — cx cos &lt;l&gt;)

I being the length of the perpendicular from point O to speed c.
Integrating between point 1 and 2 (cx /t and c2 /2) we get
MK = -22 {ctk — c\ h) (ai)
ii and /2 being the lengths of the perpendiculars from O to c,
and c2.
Above equation suggests a simple graphical method for find-
ing the resulting total force of reaction. R = V-^i2 + Rj2, its
magnitude, location and direction. Let L be the length of the per-
pendicular from O to R or the lever arm of R, then
MR = RL = yQcWg - yQch/g.
Project the directions of and c2 until they intersect at point
A. Make AB in the direction of cl equal the force yQcj/jf to any


37
scale and make AC in opposite direction to c2 equal the force
yQcJg to the same scale, then AD, the resultant of AB and AC,
is the resulting force o freaction: R shown in its correct location
and direction and to the same scale as the other forces were drawn.
The perpendicular from O to AD is the lever arm L of R.
Another and often more convenient expression for the moment
of reaction may be formed as follows:
Draw the radii Oi=r1 and O2 = r2.
Resolve the speeds c± and c2 into their radial components cir
and c.lT and their peripheral components c,p and cs„, then, since
and
f2 : ^2,, — rt: lt
c, /j = clp ri
and
&lt;2 '1 == c-tp r%
and the new formula for AfR is:


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Let &amp; be the angle between c1 and the perpendicular to rlt
measured as shown in figure and /32 be the angle between c„ and
the perpendicular to r2 measured as shown in Figure 15.* then
Ctp = ct cos /3,
clp = Ci cos (i8o-,3)i = — Ci cos [i,
By substitution we obtain
M«. = ^2. (Ci cos ,jf rj _|_ tj ri) ,2 j
Interpreting this equation, as we have interpreted the equation
for the force of reaction, we may say:
For a given rx and r2 the moment of reaction depends on and
is directly proportional to the quantity of water deviated and the
total change of the peripheral speed components.
We may obtain for the same discharge and the same rx and r2
the same results in many different ways.
Take for instance r1 = 30"; r„ = 40"; c^ = 20 feet per second
and fi2 = 300.
Let in one case ct be accelerated to c2 = 40 feet per second,
whereby /3L = 1350 and let in the other case the speed remain un-
changed, thus c„ = c1 = 20 feet per second. Then in the first case
we shall obtain:
Ms. = (40 cos 30° • 40 + 20 cos 1350 • 30) = 951 4 7V inch pounds
9 .9
In order to obtain the same moment in the second case with
ct = c, we must have
(20 cos 300-40 + 20 cos ftt • 30) = 95!-4 7^
9 9
making
ft = 64° 35'.
The two channels would be about as shown in Figs. 16 and 17.
In the first case where the water is deviated and accelerated
the deviation is much smaller than in the second case where the
water is only deviated.
♦There is an inconsistency in the way the angles ft and ft are meas-
ured. The angle at point I that corresponds to angle ft is not the assumed
f), but its supplementary angle (180-ft). This explains why the sign in the
formula for Mn changes from minus to plus.


39
/
The total deviation is (1803 — 135°)—300 = 15° in the first
case and from 64° 35' to go0 and from 900 to 300 makng a total
of 850 25' in the second case, yet both channels will produce the
same moment of reaction.
Laics II, III, and IV pertaining to the force of reaction hold
therefore equally true also until the moment of reaction.
(/&gt;) Channels rotating around an axis.
Let us now assume that the channel rotates around the axis O
with a uniform angular velocity »&gt;, while the water flows from
point 1 to point 2, changing its relative speed from u\ to iv2. Let
j8, and p., be the angles of u\ and iv„ and the tangents to the cir-
cles 1 and 2.
The change of speed and direction of flow will, of course, pro-
duce a turning moment identical with that of a stationary channel,
if now the relative speeds are taken into consideration. Thus:
In addition to this moment we obtain another one due to the
fact that the water has beside the speed of flow also a speed of
rotation which is changing in magnitude as the water flows
through the channel. This speed change will set up or require a
force acting upon the particles and reacting upon the channel and
thus it will give another positive or negative turning moment M"R
which may be found in the following way:
Take into consideration the particle of the mass m located r
feet from centre of rotation having thus a peripheral speed
(24)


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
ftp. /a.
v=ro&gt;. As the particle moves through the channel, its peripheral
speed in the very next moment will be v + dv. The peripheral
acceleration is therefore dv/dt.


41
But mass X acceleration = force. Therefore a force mdv/dt
must be acting upon the particle in addition to the forces which
we may have from other sources. This force is positive if dv is
positive, which is the case, if r2 &gt; rt (radial outward flow) and
negative if dv is negative, which is the case, if r2 &lt; rx (radial in-
ward flow). According to the law of action and reaction the par-
ticle will react with equal force in opposite direction giving thus
an additional force and consequently an additional turning mo-
ment dM"n which will be positive (acting in direction of rota-
tion) if dv is negative or if r2 &lt; rt and negative (acting in oppo-
site direction to the rotation) if dv is positive or r2 &gt; rx.
For the momentum of a particle having a speed c and located
at a distance / from the moment center, measured perpendicularly
to the direction of c zve had
dMR d (c I) = l2- • d(cl) (20)
dt g
Analogically we shall have in the case at hand
dM"* = + 22- . d (vr)
U
or
= _ yQ d (vr)
g
The positive sign holds for r„ &lt; rt. The negative sign holds for
r„ &gt; rx.
Integrating between vt at r1 and v., at r„ we obtain for ravs
&gt; rtvv
MW = i'd(vr) = + (r, v, - rt vt)
9 J 9
ri vi (25)
and for r,v2 &lt; rxvx
n vi
Jtr* = + 22. Cd (vr) = + (n z-, - r., *»)
We see again that it makes no difference for the final equation,
whether the water flows radially inward or outward as long as i
indicates the point from which and 2 the point towards which the
water flows.


The total turning moment is therefore
-- Is. cos ,J8 ra -f- v&gt;\ cos ih rl + ri f i — rt vt)
y
— ((w* cos ft — t'8) r3 + (zt&gt;, cos -f- r,) (26)
Let the resultant of u\ and v1 be c, and its direction be olP
measured as shown (between the positive directions of both c,
and z\). Then cl is apparently the real speed of flow at point 1.
Let c, be the corresponding real speed at 2 and a2 its angle meas-
ured as shown between the positive directions of c2 and i:„ Then,
since
Ws cos ft — Vt = c2(cos 1800 — a2)=: — c, cos a.:
and
Wi cos /3i -f- t'i = c, cos ai
we may write the equation (25) also in the following way:
Mt. = ?Q (ci cos «i ri — c-z cos a, r2) (27)
T/ir moment of reaction of a rotating channel is equal the mo-
ment of a stationary channel zchich produces the same actual devi-
ation as the first.

3. WORK OF REACTION.
(a) Channels arc moving on a straight line.
Mechanical work = force X speed in direction of force. Let
v be the speed of the channel in direction of Rx, then the work of
reaction is
W-m. = ifr V = l2- (wt sin &lt;bt — w 1 sin &lt;j&gt;{j v
9
The force Ry being perpendicular to direction of motion does not
do any mechanical work.
Introducing now the angles px and /?2, measured as shown, we
obtain since
ft = 900 -f 0, and ft = 900 — tf&gt;2
or:
0, = ft —900 and ^2 = oo°—ft
As = ^ (wt sin (oo° — A) — Wi sin (ft — 90°))v
&lt;/ v'
WR = 22. cos ft + a/, cos ft) w (28)*
9
*Ry in terms of ft and ft is
Ry = (a», sin ft — wx sin ft)

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
(b) Channels arc rotating around an axis.
Knowing the moment of reaction of a rotating channel the
work is found simply by multiplying the moment by the angular
velocity &lt;o.
We therefore obtain (see Fig. 20)
Wwl = — ((u't cos ,?8 — vi) r + (wl cos /3, -f rAu
g y )
or:
IVK = iQ- (Ci cos o, r, - f2 cos oj rs) u
ri&lt;» = Vi; r»« = Vt
.-. U'r = COS — f2) Vt + (Zfl COS + Vi) Vi ^
= (:c't v-i cos /3S —z»s* -f a/, t', cos fi, + f !*) (29)
'g
or:
IVk = i*. (&lt;"i j'i cos «! - ra z'2 cos &lt;i-2) 00).
&lt;J
Since IVR depends, for a certain speed &lt;u, on the force or mo-
ment of reaction, the four laws given for the force of reaction hold
also for the zvork of reaction. Thus for a given Q, ru r2 and u we
may obtain the same work of reaction in many different ways and
by many different channel shapes. If the water is deviated and
accelerated in the channels the deviation will be smaller (channels
curved less) than in case of deviation alone.
We can find still another formula for IVr as follows. Refer-
ring to Fig. 20 we may write:
w' — + v1 — 2 c,vi cos a,
tft' = ft* + V* ■— 2 C cos a2
.-. fj vx cos «, = 0 1 ''
2
CtVt&lt;X»at=C* + Vf-W*
2
Substitute in equation 29 and obtain:
W* = l£ (&lt;:,« - ft« 4- wf - u&gt;t* - - vj&gt;) (3I)
!/
The three equations 29, 30, 31 are, of course, identical but for
different problems, the one or the other will be found more con-
venient to use.


45
B. Sudden Deviation (Impact).
As was stated before and proved by the fact that the radius
of curvature of the channel disappeared from the equations, it
makes no difference, theoretically, whether the deviation of the
water stream is gradual or sudden. The equations derived for
gradual deviation must therefore hold true also in the case of
sudden deviation: channels with sudden, sharp turns (p — o). In
fact the water streams will not follow this sharp turn at all, but
they will fill out the corner with "dead water" and thus form their
own and gradually curved path (see Fig. 22). This phenomenon
can be observed clearly in the case of a jet impinging upon a
straight surface under a right angle. The stream will then have
the appearance shown in Fig. 23, suggesting that a cone of dead
water is formed upon which the water stream is split and deviated
as upon a solid curved cone.
y^zy. 22. /=tf.2&amp;
If nevertheless a distinction is being made in practice between
the gradual and sudden deflection or between the reaction and
impact this is done only because of the fact that the hydraulic
loss is greater in the second case (impact) than in the first (reac-
tion) all other things being equal. What the cause or nature of
this additional loss is, is not definitely known at the present time.
The scientific experimenters did not pay sufficient attention to this
subject. But it is natural to think that the "dead water" is in fact
not "dead" but whirling and eddying around lively, forming thus
a wavy surface for the flowing streams if, at all, a surface can be
spoken of. The eddies and waves will be transmitted to the flow-


47
ing water streams thus creating general commotion in the entire
stream.
The fact however that there is an additional loss in a sudden
deviation can not have any effect upon our equations, for the sim-
ple reason that they are free from any forces. Thus the formulae
16 to 31 hold also for channels shown in Figs. 24 to 29. Care
should be taken only that in every case the total deviation is
actually expressed in the formulae.
Let us now omit the upper part of the channel shown in Fig.
28, but let us assume that the water stream is entering the remain-
ing part of the channel at point 1 in the same relative direction as
before. Let us call this speed «»0 and its angle /?0. Then at point
.1 there is a sudden deviation from tc0, j80, to wu /?, and between
point 1 and 2 a gradual (or gradual and sudden) deviation from
7C'i, Pl to tc'o, B„. The total deviation therefore, which must appear
in the equations for reaction, is that from u&gt;n /?„ to iv„ /}.,. And so
for instance the equations for the work of reaction will be
TFr = (wt vt cos,% - vf + K'o Vi cos /?o + t'i!) (32)
a
= (c0 fi COS Of — Ct rt COS n2) (33)
9
= (&lt;-o* - cj + w, - wo' + C« - r22) (34)
The additional loss caused by the sudden deviation will become
apparent in consuming more than the simple friction head and in
thus reducing the values of R, Mr and JFr by reducing the speeds
of flow. If this additional loss is to be avoided then the total de-
viation must be made gradual, that is to say, the channels must be
shaped as shown in the dotted lines. In the case of Fig. 29 this
means that the channels must be shaped so that the directions of
their first elements at points 1 will coincide with the directions of
the relative entrance speeds zv0. Thus /?, = @u.
And so we come to the old and well known rule of turbine
design: For best efficiency the buckets must be designed in such
a way as to hair an entry free from impact (shocklcss entrance).
In order to fulfill this requirement we use besides the moving
channels (called buckets) another set of similar but stationary
channels (called guide var.es) by means of which we guide the


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
water so (a0) as to obtain for the relative entrance speed w0 the
required direction /30 = /81. (The relative entrance speed iu0 is
found from the actual speed c0 and the bucket speed vx by com-
posing + co and —z\.)
With some types of turbines it will be impossible to make the
speed 7f„ equal wt also in magnitude due to the fact that it will be
impossible to make the area at the discharge from the guide vanes,
vieived relatively to the moving buckets, exactly equal the passage
area at the bucket entrance. In this case there will always be a
certain entrance loss due to the sudden speed change: wa to n\.
This loss, however, is always small, and therefore in the working
equations the values cn,7('„.an,/?0 are usually replaced by cJ,iv1,a1,pi,
and thus it is assumed that with entry free from impact the speed
diagram at point o is entirely identical with that at point I. The
loss of the sudden speed change is then taken care of collectively
with the other losses. This simplifies the equations used for the
computing of turbines considerably, but for other studies, for
instance the studies of the behavior of the turbine under variable
conditions, it will be less confusing to make the distinction between
the values as obtained from the discharge from guide vanes (in-
dex o) and those obtained from the entrance into runner buckets
(index t).

NOTES ON DRAINAGE RECLAMATION.
BY FRANK L. BOLTON, 'OQ.
The great possibilities in the reclamation of swamp and over-
flowed lands are beginning1 to attract attention. Investigations by
thoughtful and enterprising men have been made, and these stud-
ies have brought out very clearly what a vast undeveloped wealth
is represented by our present unused swamp areas. Many pro-
jects are now being formulated by the various states, the national
government, and private interests for carrying out this work on
a large scale.
The magnitude of the problem becomes apparent when it is
realized that the combined area of such swamp lands in the United
States is ten times the area of Holland. No one portion of the
country has a monopoly of this land, as nearly every state has
within its borders a portion of this vast domain; so that the ques-
tion of reclamation is in no sense a local or sectional one, but is
truly a national problem.
Much of this land is found in very large tracts, such, for in-
stance, as the Everglades of Florida, or the Delta Lands of the
Mississippi, where millions of acres are to be found in one body;
but probably the greater portion of this swamp area is represented
by the smaller tracts, varying in size from a few hundred acres
up to twenty or thirty thousand acres.
That these lands will become enormously valuable after recla-
mation cannot be gainsaid. The two primary reasons for their in-
trinsic value are to be found in the facts that they are extremely
fertile, and in many cases lie immediately adjacent to our large
cities. Government analyses of these lands, those made by state
chemists, soil experts, and practical farmers all agree that these
lands are among the richest known; and there is also the practical
demonstration to be seen in many places where marvelous crops
are now growing on land that a few years ago was worthless
swamp; so that the demonstration is convincing beyond the possi-
bility of doubt that these lands are wondrously fertile.


The demand for these lands is increasing every year, and this
increase is bound to be accelerated in the near future. Until with-
in a few years the United States has had such an abundance of
well watered prairie farm land that little attention has been paid
to the reclamation of swamps. But now that the markets of the
world are looking to us for their food products, and as our own
population is increasing at the rate of about three millions a year,
and as practically all our large area of natural farm land has been
or is being opened up, it is obvious that the demand for the re-
clamation of all waste places will become more and more pressing
every year.
Are the problems of reclamation difficult? Decidedly not in
most cases. The engineering problems involved are in general
of the very simplest nature; in fact, there are probably very few
cases in this country where the difficulties to be encountered are
at all comparable with those that have been met and successfully
overcome in similar work in Holland.
Several different views are advanced by those who have stud-
ied this problem as to how and by whom this work shall be carried
out. Some think that it is a proper field for exploitation by priv-
ate capital. Others believe that the problem is much too large
for private initiative to handle successfully, and these advocate
that the aid of the national government be enlisted to carry out the
work along lines analogous to the irrigation work in the West.
Many of the larger tracts cover portions of several counties, or
even of several states, and it can be seen that many difficulties
arise in these cases due to different drainage laws, et cetera; and
as such swamps should be handled as a unit, it is thought by
many that no power less than the national government is in the
position to successfully carry out such complicated and gigantic
undertakings. With this end in viewr the National Drainage Re-
clamation Congress has just been organized, and in cooperation
with the Irrigation Congress will exert its energies toward en-
listing the aid of the government. Doubtless the government
will enter into this work in the near future, but whether this oc-
curs, or not, there is certain to be a broad field for private under-
takings for many years to come.


5i
In view of the awakening interest in this reclamation work, it
is thought that a few details in connection with a project now
nearing completion are pertinent at this time. There is also, it
seems, a rather meager amount of published information on work
of this nature, so that a few details may prove of worth to those
who anticipate engaging in this line of work.
Swamp reclamation naturally divides itself into two classes,
gravity drainage, and artificial drainage by pumping. In the for-
mer case it is possible by constructing proper ditches to secure a
gravity outlet, so that the swamp is unwatered by the free flow of
the water from off the land. In the latter case the swamp usually
borders some river, lake, bayou, or the ocean, and as the swamp
surface is only a very little higher than the adjoining body of
water, or may even at times be partly submerged, it is impossible
to drain the land by gravity, and recourse must be had to pumps
for lowering the water table sufficiently to allow plant growth.
The project under consideration belongs to the latter class.
Although only a few hundred acres in extent, the engineering
features involved in its reclamation are typical of those that must
be applied to very extensive areas of swamps of this class. This
tract is located in the Irondequoit Valley, about a mile east of the
City of Rochester, New York. The Irondequoit River runs
through the swamp, discharging into Irondequoit Bay through
two branches. The surface of the marsh is about nine inches
above the normal surface of the water in the river, but during
high water in spring the land is completely flooded to a depth of
about eighteen inches. The formation is alluvial, being the grad-
ual accumulation of the soil wash of the tributary drainage area;
but with this deposit is mixed a large percentage of decayed vege-
table matter, the vegetation growing exceedingly rank on this
land, only to rot down annually and add humus to the soil.
The problem in brief was to build a dike along the river to
prevent overflow during high water; to construct a drainage canal
through the entire tract, into which lateral drainage ditches dis-
charge; and finally to install pumping equipment for lowering the
water. The accompanying map shows the general shape of the
tract, and the location of the artificial structures necessary for its
reclamation.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Cross Section of O/ke.
Dike.
The dike was built along the westerly bank of the east channel,
and extended across at the southerly end to connect with the hard
land, as shown. It is 6.500 feet long, and a cross section is shown
in the figure. It is five feet high, eight feet wide on top, and 24
feet wide at the base. The material was excavated from the bot-
tom and side of the river bed, a floating dredge being used for
this purpose. Being of fine alluvial material, deposited wet, the
dike required no rolling or compacting other than that obtained
from dropping the material from the dredge bucket. The great-
est head that this dike will be called upon to withstand is 18 inches
of water, so that the top of the dike is three and a half feet above
the previous high water record. There is very little current in the
river at this point, so that erosion should be slight. The founda-
tion was prepared by cutting off all flags and marsh grass close
to the ground and removing them from the site, no attempt being
made to grub the base. While the dike has not not yet been test-
ed by high water, it is not anticipated that the seepage will be
serious. Experiments were made in this soil to determine the
rate of percolation, and it'was found that on a five-foot head the
seepage amounted to 1.8 gallon per hour per lineal foot of dike.
As this soil was saturated at the time of the test, it is thought that
the above estimate of seepage will be reduced after the ground is
thoroughly drained.
A cut-off ditch was excavated as shown, paralleling the dike
and removed therefrom about ten feet. The function of this ditch
is to intercept any seepage that may take place through or under
the dike.


View taken from point shown in map looking north-westerly, showing general appearance of the project and the country
in the immediate vicinity. The river and dike show in the foreground with the straight stretch at the right of the picture
running northerly past the pumping station into the flats at the head of the bay. Along the opposite edge of the marsh the
west channel shows as a thin line up to the spot of open water where the earth fill was made.


53
On the north side of the marsh the roadway serves as a dike
between the swamp and the bay. There was an opening in this
roadway,however, where the westerly branch of the river discharg-

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
ed into the bay. The bottom of the river at this point was com-
posed of light silt to a depth of some 30 feet, and it therefore
required a large amount of material to block up this opening. A
high hill some 500 feet away afforded the material for this pur-
pose, and the excavation and transportation were performed by
hydraulic means, the material consisting of fine lake sand, with
some hardpan, being sluiced to the fill through elevated sluice-
ways. The water for this purpose was pumped from the westerly
river channel.
Drainage Canal.
The westerly river channel, blocked off at both ends, offered a
natural drainage canal running the entire length of the marsh.
This channel is about thirty feet wide, eight feet deep, and was
extended at the lower end by an artificial canal running parallel to
the road and terminating at the pumping station on the easterly
branch of the river. The water in this drainage canal is kept
four feet below the surface of the ground.
Lateral Ditches.
Into this drainage canal the lateral ditches discharge. They
are three feet deep. 18 inches wide at the bottom, and four feet
wide at the top. They are located every 200 feet apart at present,
but it is probable that their number will have to be increased in
the future to secure the best drainage conditions. The spacing
of these ditches is a matter that can only be determined by exper-
iment, and will vary for different projects, depending on the na-
ture of the soil encountered. In the course of a few years it is
probable that these open ditches will be replaced by underground
tile drains, but this will not be attempted until the ground has
settled into its permanent place. Several advantages exist for
tile drains over open ditches, much valuable space is conserved,
agricultural operations are facilitated, and better drainage is
claimed to result therefrom.
Pumping Plant.
The pumping equipment for a project of this nature must be
large enough to take care of the runoff and the seepage through
the dike. The latter item is very small comparatively, and is es-
timated to amount to only 180 gallons per minute.

To prognosticate the rainfall that must be taken care of, re-
course was had to the records of the local weather bureau, where
it was found that the greatest rainfall on record amounted to about
four inches in 24 hours. It was assumed that 50 per cent, of this
rainfall might rim off in 24 hours, amounting on the total drain-
age area of 300 acres to 2,100,000 cubic feet. All of this water
will not have to be pumped in 24 hours, as considerable storage
capacity exists. Assuming that the water in the drainage canal
is four feet below the surface of the ground at the beginning of a
heavy rainfall, it is obvious that if this surface was allowed to
rise even with the ground surface, a large amount of water could
be stored. This storage capacity amounts to 1,100,000 cubic feet
so that the pumps must be of sufficient capacity to handle the dif-
ference between the stored amount and the runoff, or 1,000.000
cubic feet in 24 hours. To handle this flow we are installing one
8-inch and one 12-inch centrifugal pump. These pumps are of
the side suction type, belt-driven from electric motors. Under
normal conditions they will operate against a head of about three
feet, but during high water in the spring, this head will be in-
creased to seven feet. It is probable that most of the pumping
will be done at night, as a very low power rate can be obtained
from the local power company for this night "off-peak" service.
During times of heavy rainfall, however, it will be necessary to
run the pumps 24 hours a day.
Moisture Control.
Attention is called to the fact that such a system of drainage
canals, lateral ditches, and pumping equipment as outlined above,
offers an exceptionally good means for sub-surface irrigation. It
is seen that it is possible to control absolutely the water table over
the entire tract by simply regulating the time of pump operation.
When it is remembered what high annual charges are considered
justifiable on some irrigation projects in the West, for insuring
a water supply in such amounts and at such times as desired, it
is evident that the possession of a similar irrigation system on a
tract like this, adds no small amount to its value and dependability
from an agricultural point of view. And this possibility for irri-
gation is secured at no additional cost, as the completion of an


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
extensive drainage system necessitates in itself the existence of
the irrigation possibilities.
Cost of Project.
This reclamation will involve a total expenditure of $120 an
acre. This includes the purchase of the raw land and the com-
plete drainage. The rather high unit cost in this case is due to the
limited area reclaimed, the great length of dike required for pro-
tection, and the high cost of the raw land; this latter item is due
to the proximity to a large city that is fast growing in this direc-
tion. While this project is typical of many in so far as its engi-
neering features are concerned, the cost of the work is far above
the average, as a few illustrations of the cost of other undertak-
ings will show.
The government has recently completed plans for the reclama-
tion of about a million acres in the St. Francis Valley, Arkansas,
where the estimated cost is $9.04 an acre. On another project in
the Marais des Chygnes Valley, Kansas, it is estimated that
300,000 acres can be reclaimed for $20 an acre. Neither of these
figures include the purchase of the land. The writer has recently
been investigating a project in New York State where 2,000 acres
can be purchased and reclaimed for $50 an acre; and another
project in Louisiana where over 100,000 acres can be purchased
and reclaimed for $23 an acre.
The value of this land after reclamation varies as greatly as
does the cost of drainage. The nature of the soil, climatic condi-
tions,-proximity to a railroad, or nearness to a large city, are all
factors which determine its worth. The tract described in detail
above will in a few years probably be worth $1,000 per acre, being
near a large city, and located in a famous truck garden belt where
land cannot be bought for this sum. Reclaimed land in Louisiana
sells readily at $100 an acre. These two figures probably repre-
sent the extremes in value of land of this nature after reclamation.
In comparing the difference between the cost of accomplishing
the reclamation, and the value of the land after reclamation, one
might think at first sight that this line of work offers a good field
for getting rich quick. Cut it must be remembered that it usually
takes several years to carry out the reclamation work, and then
several years more to dispose of the land, so that quite a period of


57
time elapses before a turn-over of the invested capital can be
made; so that the selling costs and the administration costs ma-
terially reduce the apparent profit. On the other hand, this field
should attract the attention of the investor who is willing to wait,
and who is desirous of engaging in truly constructive work, de-
veloping the resources of the country. The operations are prac-
tically certain if well planned and executed, and the profits are
probably as large as legitimate development can offer.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
THE UPWARD PRESSURE OF PERMEATING WATER
ON DAMS.*
BV W. O. CROSSMAN, '12.
If we try to analyse the conditions necessary for stability in a
dam or retaining wall, we find that the forces acting upon it may
he generally divided into four classes, viz., the horizontal forces
uiie to the pressure of the water on the sides; the vertical force
due to the weight of the structure itself; the upward reaction of
the foundations ; and the upward pressure on the base of the water
which permeates the material on which the dam rests. Each has
its effect on the safety of the structure, but the third, being the
ieast apparent, is the one which interests us most now.
The water standing on the upstream side of the dam causes a
horizontal thrust equal to the whole pressure on that surface, and
consequently there is a tendency for the whole structure to slide
down stream. This is resisted in several ways. Sometimes the
bottom is notched or serrated, sometimes the piling on which the
dam may be built is used, or the whole structure may be set into
the foundation some distance. The head-water also causes an
overturning moment. If there is water on the downstream side
of the dam. its effects are similar to those of the head-water, but
just opposite in direction, and usually much smaller on account
of the less height of water. The weight of the dam, taken as act-
ing through the center of gravity of its cross-section, causes a
moment which must oppose that of the head-water. The effect
of the permeating water is a tipping moment in the same direction
as the one due to the larger head and also an upward pressure
over the whole base which, by decreasing the pressure of the dam
on the earth and by lubricating the material, lessens the value of
friction in holding the dam in place.
In computing the values of all these moments, the center
should be taken at the downstream edge of the middle third of the
base. The dam itself tends to tip about the downstream edge of

ihe base, but as is shown in mechanics, if the line of action of the
resultant force on any rectangular joint cuts it at a point outside
;ne middle third, the stress produced in the most distant edge will
be opposite in kind to that normally produced by the resultant. In
this case tension would be produced at the upstream edge of the
base, the joint would open, and the water entering this opening
under the full pressure of the head-water would cause an upward
force that would greatly increase the overturning moment of 'he
dam.
The pressure of the water permeating the foundation does not
act on the whole area of the base, but affects only a portion of it,
varying in amount with the nature of the material. This fraction
of the area expressed in per cent, is called the "permeability" or
"porosity" of the material and represents the part of the base
which is exposed to the pressure of the permeating water, either
by direct contact or by transmission through loose particles of the
material itself. It varies from 15% or less in dense rock to nearly
100% in sand. It is used as a factor in the computations.
The pressure head with which this underground water acts
on the dam varies from point to point along its base,—being equal
;o the height of head-water at the surface of the stream bed on
the upstream side, and equal to the height of the tail-water at
the corresponding point on the downstream side. In other words,
there is a loss of head between these two points due to friction in
the capillary passages, equal to the difference in height between
the surface of the water on the two sides of the dam. We as-
sume that this friction loss is uniformly distributed along the
route which the water traverses in passing from the one point to
ihc other.
The conditions are as shown in Figs. 1 and 2.
Let h and h' represent the heights of head- and tail-waters re-
spectively: b the base and IV the weight of the dam; and k the
permeability of the material. A is the center of moments and the
horizontal distance from A to the center of gravity may be called
. Then if the dam is not set into its foundation the forces act-
ing will be as shown in Fig. 1.
The pressure heads of the head- and tail-waters are represent-
ed graphically by the triangles BCI and DBF respectively, and


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
may be replaced in computation by their resultants R and R' act-
ing at one-third the heights h and W from the base. The pres-
sures acting on the base are shown by the polygon CDGH, HC
and GD being equal respectively to IC and FD from the law of
fluid pressure at a point, but as these pressures act upon only k
per cent of the area of the base, their summation must be multi-
plied by this factor to obtain the total force acting. Then if this
polygon is divided as shown in the figure, the forces represented
by the triangle CDG will have no moment about A, and the arm
of the resultant KP of those represented by CGH will be one-
third b. The condition for stability, considering a section of unit
length along the dam, is:
Wa 5 1/3 Rh — 1/3 R'h' + 1/3 kPb.
In finding the moment f¥a it is simpler in an irregularly shaped
structure to divide the cross-section into simple geometrical forms
and take the sum of the moments of each about A, than to locate
the centroid of the whole. In the case shown in Fig. 1, the loss
of head per foot is (!i — h')/b.
If the dam is set into its foundation a distance d, the conditions
which exist are similar to those shown in Fig. 2. The pressure
at D in this case is not equal to that due to a head of BD, but is


61
less by an amount equal to d times the loss of head per foot, or
d X ^ ^d • This is represented in the diagram by AX. Simi-
larly, since the loss of head is talcing place in the direction E to F,
the pressure head at E is greater than EG by the same amount, or
is equal to EG + d X f^j-^' This is shown at 01. The same re-
sult is obtained by subtracting (b + d) X |~~p from 5£&gt;. Then,
proceeding as before, the condition for stability is:
lVasRX(i/3h + d) + kX2/3d X CDAf + k X i/3 &lt;* X DLM + 1/3 fePfc
- * X 1/3 &lt;* X EHI-k X 2/3 X - K'XO/3 + d).
If there is a tight sheet piling under either edge of the dam,
its effect is first to increase the length of the path of the water
and so decrease the loss of head per foot. Its effect on the over-
turning moment varies with its position under the dam.
If the sheet piling is under the upstream edge as shown in
Fig. 3, the water may be assumed to take cither of the paths indi-
cated by the arrows. There is doubt as to which is nearer the
the truth. In the case shown by the full arrows, the upward pres-
sure ordinate under the upstream edge becomes less than /t by


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
twice the length of the piling times the head loss per foot, the
downstream ordinate remaining unchanged. On the other hand,
if the water follows the line of the broken arrows, the upward
pressure ordinate is decreased by once the length of the piling
times the rate of head loss. This rate, however, would be greater
than the former one. Either condition would decrease the over-
turning moment on the dam because, with the center heretofore
considered, the overturning force acting on the base, represented
by the triangle CGH,—Fig. I,—is directly proportional to the up-
stream pressure ordinate and independent of the pressure at the
downstream edge.
If the piling is under the downstream edge as in Fig. 4, the
same uncertainty as before exists as to the path of the water, but
regardless of this we may say that sheet piling at the downstream
edge of a dam does not affect the turning moment acting upon it.
The effect on the resistance to sliding, however, would be altered
by the changes in the total pressure on the base.
If the structure is set into its foundation, a slight variation &lt;rt
the pressures at the heel and toe is caused by the use of sh;et
piling due to the difference in rate of loss of head, but the effec. s
are essentially the same as those just mentioned.

REINFORCED CONCRETE IN EARTHQUAKE
DISTRICTS.
BY LEWIS AI.DEN ESTES, A.B., B.C.E., 'iO.
(Prepared, with the permission of the publishers, from the writer's
booklet "Earthquake-Proof Construction," published and copyrighted by
the Trussed Concrete Steel Co., Detroit, Mich.)
The immense destruction of property and the terrible loss of
life in the disasters in California, Jamaica and Costa Rica, Cala-
bria and Messina in the last few years have shown the necessity
for a thorough study of the problem of earthquake-resisting con-
struction: and the following pages have been prepared with the
purpose of presenting the opinions of a number of eminent geol-
ogists, engineers ami structural seismologists upon reinforced
concrete, as a desirable form of construction for zones of high
seismicity. The design of earthquake-proof structures is largely
an empirical matter and the only proof of merit that carries con-
viction is the successful resistance of the structure to shock. From
the numerous accounts which have been examined of the effects
of different earthquakes, it appears to be a fact beyond dispute
that structures of reinforced concrete have always displayed re-
markable resistive qualities. The following editorial in the Bngi-
necring News, Vol. 55, 1906, No. 21, on the California earth-
quake, might have been written with equal truth of almost any
locality in which reinforced concrete has undergone seismic shock.
"Reinforced concrete made an enviable record in the recent
California earthquake disaster. No one, we believe, will dispute
this statement who reads with an open mind the accounts of the
l.thavior of this material published in this and preceding issues
of Engineering Xezcs. It is true, of course, that there was not a
large amount of reinforced concrete construction within the area
of greatest damage and that the buildings in which it existed were
not large or lofty, but this does not remove the fact that every
reinforced concrete building in the district visited by the earth-
quake and fire is still standing with only minor damages to be re-
paired."


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
THE ACTION OF EARTHQUAKE FORCES.
The forces which act upon all forms of construction as a re-
sult of seismic disturbances are, first: those resulting from the in-
ertia of the structure and the consequent vibration, and second;
direct shear, as a result of a differential movement of the ground.
The principal damage to buildings subjected to the first type
of stress, that is, stress due to vibration, results from the fact that
the different parts of the structure vibrate with different periods.
As a clear exposition of this principle, we quote Professor Hobbs:
"A building in the throes of an earthquake tends to vibrate
like an inverted pendulum, or more frequently, like a series of
them, since it is usually constructed of different materials, each
having its own natural period of vibration. Not only do the dif-
ferent materials correspond to different vibration periods, but if
there are wings or extensions to the main portion of the building,
these parts, in so far as they vibrate as units, will further have
different periods from the main portion. It is this difference of
vibration period which gives rise to differential internal or 'rack-
ing' stresses, tending to destroy the integrity of the structure.
// all parts can be so firmly joined together that the building
moves essentially as a unit, it may be said to be earthquake-proof."
If the differential movement of the earth is large and of deep
origin, as over a main fault, no structure can withstand the stress-
es, but if it is merely a movement of the surface layer, the proba-
tility of damage may be reduced to a minimum by proper design.
Professor Omori and Professor Milne both point out that the
.Movement at the surface of the earth, especially in "made" ground
Jr marshy districts, is much greater than at a short distance be-
jbw the surface. In fact the experiments of Professor Milne
showed, during a severe earthquake in Japan in 1885, an ampli-
tude of motion at the bottom of a pit ten feet deep only one-thirty-
fourth of the movement at the surface. The liability to destruc-
tion of buildings with shallow foundations situated on unstable
earth, is at once apparent. The vibration of the surface layer is
often accompanied by what may be termed "secondary" shear, re-
sulting from a differential movement along a line between earth
of different densities.


65
A rotational movement is often induced in buildings, monu-
ments, etc., occurring through the combination of earth vibrations
of different amplitude and direction, or perhaps, as Milne points
out in "Seismology," caused by a rectilinear motion of the ground
which is not parallel to a plane of symmetry of the structure. Dis-
tortional stresses caused in this manner are very destructive to
structures not designed to withstand their effect.
It is well known that hanks of streams under seismic vibration
will approach each other. As Professor Hobbs states: "Whether
occupied by streams or not, it seems to be clear that the vicinity
of valleys is marked bv unusual surface compression in a direc-
tion at right angles to the valley." The effect of this movement
on a bridge is to exert compression which will cause he bridge
either either to buckle, or to push apart the tops of the abutments,
or to shear the anchor bolts or the abutment itself along a plane
of weakness.
EARTHQUAKE-PROOF CONSTRUCTION.
The general action of seismic forces having been outlined, we
come now to a consideration of the essentials of construction to
best withstand these forces.
Buildings:—The prime requisite for a stable building is a deep
and firm foundation. Where ground solid enough for concrete
footings of either the ordinary or "spread" type is not available,
piles should be used. Milne emphasizes the value of a free base-
ment to prevent damage to the building through the movement of
the surface earth, which as previously discussed, is much greater
than at a short distance underground. C. G. Knott recommends
trenching all around buildings, or at least on the side from which
earthquake shocks usually come.
The next essential quality a building should possess is stiff-
ness. The frame should be strong and well tied together, to ob-
tain as nearly as possible the "monolithic" condition, so that the
building will vibrate as a unit. How perfectly all-reinforced con-
crete construction fulfills this condition may be gathered from the
following comments in the report of A. E. H. Herschel, Building
Surveyor of Kingston, Jamaica, to the Colonial Secretary of Ja-
maica; on the effects of the earthquakes of April 13th and May


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
14th, 1910, on the buildings at Cartago and San Jose, Costa Rica,
with recommendations on earthquake-resisting construction.
"This (reinforced concrete) is the only material which really
satisfies all the requirements mentioned above. Its strength be-
gins where the strength of ordinary unreinforced hrickwork ends,
for in reinforced concrete, no allowance is made for the strength
of concrete in tension. The steel takes all the tensional stresses.
So this material combines the durability and fire-resisting quali-
ties of masonry with the tensional strength and ductility of steel,
and above this it possesses certain qualities which are peculiarly
its own. It has greater resilience or power to resume its original
shape quickly, than any other building material and it can be bent
without failing to an extent which would surprise anyone who has
not seen it.
"It is truly monolithic, that is to say, it has no joint; and it
forms a light building for the loads it can carry. As regards its
durability, all that can be said is that it appears to get stronger
the older it is. and this process appears to go on for an indefinite
period."
From Bulletin 324 of the L*. S. Geological Survey on the Cal-
ifornia Earthquake: an article by Richard L. Humphrey:
"While reinforced concrete structures were few in the zone of
seismic disturbances, these few stood the test by earthquake and
fire in a highly satisfactory manner. Rigidity and stiffness and
a high fire resistance are inherent qualities of concrete, and this
material proved admirablv suited to resist these extraordinary
tests.
"Concrete, especially reinforced concrete, because of its great
adhesive strength and reinforcing metal, proved more satisfac-
tory than any other material. Its solid monolithic structure pro-
duces a successful earthquake-resisting material, inasmuch as it
moves as a unit; moreover it offers a maximum resistance to fire."
Charles Derleth, Jr.. Professor of Structural Engineering in
the University of California, in his report upon the San Francisco
earthquake, published in "The California Earthquake of 1906."
edited by David Starr Jordan, says:
"The little San Francisco evidence that one finds, considering
also a few reinforced structures, or partially reinforced structures


67
in other places, such as Oakland and Palo Alto, leads one to the
conclusion that buildings scientifically designed in reinforced con-
crete present admirable qualifications for earthquake resistance.
There is no reason why reinforced concrete cage constructed
buildings of at least six or eight stories in height should not be
built in San Francisco. A reinforced concrete structure, when in-
telligently designed, generously proportioned and honestly built,
is a monolith of great coherence and high elasticity, combining (he
very properties best able to resist earthquake vibration."
When buildings are subjected to the "racking" motion of earth-
quakes, the weak points of construction are at once apparent.
Poorly designed, loosely constructed and inadequately braced
buildings collapse like a house ot cards. Professor Derleth and
other investigators mention the shearing of rivets in the tower of
the Union Ferry Building and in the basement of the Flood Build-
ing at the time of the San Francisco earthquake. In the case of
the Union Ferry Building, the rivets which were sheared were in
the tie rod and wind strut connections, and in the basement of the
Flood Building a number of rivet heads were sheared off in the
connections between the girder beams and column shelf angles
upon which the beams rested. Soule, in his report on the Cali-
fornia earthquake, printed in the bulletin of the Geological Sur-
vey previously mentioned, stated that after the earthquake, bolts
and rivets in the Union Trust Building w'ere found to be loose
and some were sheared off. Sevvell, in a report printed in the
same bulletin, calls attention to the empty rivet holes in the tower
of the city hall, although he was not able to determine whether
the rivets had been sheared off or omitted entirely by a careless
erecting gang. To those who are prone to extol the skill with
which steel frame buildings are erected, his statement that "the
latter will seem a plausible supposition to anyone familiar with
the way in which an average erecting gang does its work," will
be of interest. In this connection it may be pointed out that in a
reinforced concrete structure, there is not possible that concen-
tration of shear which may occur at a riveted joint.
The most general cause for the failure of buildings results
from the differential motion which occurs through the inadequate
bonding or tying together of the various portions of the structure.


THE MICH1CAN TECHNIC
The words of Professor Hobbs in this regard cannot be improved
upon:
"Where roof beams have not been properly tied at the bottom,
the vertical component of the shock results in a sudden settling of
the roof, causing it to spread at the base and 'kick' over the walls
When floors are not properly anchored to the walls, the horizontal
component of the shock causes these heavy masses to be thrown
against the walls like battering rams, so that the building is
wrecked in parts. In a similar way, roofs, when not properly an-
chored to the walls, are slid over them and being left without sup-
port, collapse."
Heavy roofs, as of adobe, which are unfortunately so common
in earthquake countries, are a menace in times of seismic activity
and are always a principal cause of damage and loss of life. The
center of gravity of the building should be kept as low as possible
to minimize the effect of the inertia of the structure.
In a reinforced concrete building, which is of all types the
most monolithic when properly built, there are especial features
of design which should be carefully considered. All beams, col-
umns and floor slabs should be thoroughly tied together and a
liberal amount of steel placed in the top of the slabs to take care
of the negative moment and also to act as a safety factor in the
event of reversal of stress due to shock. Careful attention should
be given to the adequate bonding of the roof beams to the columns.
Column reinforcement should be carried well down and anchored
in the footings which should be heavily reinforced and founded
on firm ground. Outside walls and partitions should be of rein-
forced concrete, the reinforcement extending well into the sur-
rounding beams and columns.
Terra cotta and hollow tile partitions and floors did not give
satisfaction in the California disaster, either as earthquake-resist-
ing or fireproof materials. Derleth says: "The earthquake cer-
tainly did very much more damage to tile partitions in San Fran-
cisco than is generally admitted. These partitions have little
strength and are readily collapsible. They have no elastic con-
tinuity."
The basis of all conclusions and the only way in which the
truth of the foregoing remarks may be borne out, is the study of


69
actual structures which have successfully passed the earthquake
test, and the following examples are submitted as being typical of
the behavior of reinforced concrete construction.
Bekins Van and Storage Company's Warehouse:—Among the
buildings which passed through the California earthquake and fire
of April 18, 1906, there is probably none which has been so uni-
versally mentioned and discussed as the above structure. There
had been a great deal of opposition to reinforced concrete, due to
the influence of the labor unions, and this structure was the only
building of considerable size in San Francisco which approached
a true type of this form of construction. The brick walls adopted
by the architect, under protest, as a concession to the brick layers'
union, were shattered, thus indicating the severity of the shock,
but otherwise the building was unharmed by the earthquake and
succeeding fire. As this structure has been deemed so important
by seismologists in the discussion of earthquake-resisting con-
struction, one or two of the comments of investigators will un-
doubtedly be of interest.
A letter from the architect of the above building, to the Truss-
ed Steel Company, printed in Engineering News, Volume 55,
1906, page 520:
"You may be interested to know that the warehouse I have
under construction here, using your bars, is up two stories—the
third floor slab being finished four days before the earthquake—
and that not a crack of any kind is visible in the columns of the
first story or the beams and slabs of the second floor. I made as
careful an examination as possible from the floor and am more
than delighted with its condition.
"Because of the influence of the bricklayers' union, the city,
authorities refused us a permit for this building until wc conceded
brick walls. These walls are so badly cracked that probably one-
third of same will have to be rebuilt. If we had had reinforced
concrete outside walls I am confident that the earthquake would
have done no damage to this building.
Yours very truly,
April 23, 1906. R. W. Hart, Architect.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
From Bulletin 324 of the U. S. Geological Survey, entitled.
"The San Francisco Earthquake and Fire"; a report by Richard
L. Humphrey on the "Effects of the Earthquake and Fire on Var-
ious Structures and Structural Materials."
"The building under construction by the Bekins Van and
Storage Company at the corner of Thirteenth and Mission Streets
was the only example of the pure type of reinforced concrete in
the city. Two of the six floors were erected, the walls being made
of brick laid in lime mortar, and the floors and columns of rein-
forced concrete.
"The walls were badly cracked by the earthquake but the re-
inforced concrete was uninjured. Considerable furniture stored
in the building was burned and the heat slightly blistered the un-
der surface of the concrete floor, which was still green at the time
of the disaster."
From the same bulletin, a report by Frank Soule on "The
Earthquake and Fire and Their Effects on Structural Steel and
Steel Frame Buildings":
"There was in San Francisco at the time of the earthquake,
only one building of considerable size constructed of reinforced
concrete. This fact was due to the opposition of certain labor
unions to the use of this material in place of brick and stone. The
building referred to is that of the Bekins Van and Storage Com-
pany at 190 West Mission Street. This building had outside
walls of brick, but was massively constructed on the interior with
columns, beams and floors of reinforced concrete. It was orig-
inally intended to carry it to a height of four stories, but on ac-
count of the earthquake which occurred during construction, the
building was finished to include only the second story. (It has
since been fully completed to a height of six stories, with the use
of concrete walls as desired by the owner.) At the time of the
fire, the permanent doors or iron were not in place and the fire
gained access to the front or south room, where very slight dam-
age was inflicted. The entire main interior and the goods stored
therein were unharmed and the building has been in continuous
use since completion. The brick building adjoining, however, was
badly injured by the earthquake and was afterwards burned."
Other Buildings—California:—Although there were no other


7'
structures of any considerable size of reinforced concrete in the
district visited by the California earthquake, the comments on
some of the smaller buildings are of value. From the Engineer-
ing Record. Volume 53, 1906, an article by J. L5. Leonard on ''The
Effect of the California Earthquake on Reinforced Concrete":
"In other sections near the city there were small structures
built entirely of reinforced concrete. Those received the full force
of the earthquake and showed no damage therefrom. They seemed
to have ridden the waves or vibrations, as one occupant describes
it, as though they were so many cast-iron boxes rising and falling
en bloc, with an entire absence of the rumbling and grinding noise
which was prevalent in all other classes of construction.
"An inquiry among architects and engineers together with my
own observations have failed to reveal any instance of failure on
the part of reinforced concrete. Its general behavior has been
such as to make it the most favorably considered material for the
rebuilding of San Francisco by the investing public."
At the Leland Stanford University there was presented a
splendid proof of the superiority of reinforced concrete over
brick construction. Quoting again from Bulletin 324 of the U. S.
Geological Survey; J. S. Sewell's report:
"The buildings of the third class at the Stanford University
were built of concrete. The girls' dormitory had concrete walls
and timber interior construction and in the central portion of the
Leland Stanford Junior Museum, the oldest part of the building,
the walls and interior construction were of reinforced concrete.
There were two wings built of brickwork with reinforced con-
crete floor construction. It is reasonable to suppose that the in-
tensity of the force applied to this building by the earthquake was
nearly uniform over the entire structure. The two brick wings
were practically shaken down, suffering I should judge, more than
fifty per cent damage. The reinforced concrete central portion,
viewed from the exterior, seemed absolutely undamaged. In the
interior a few cracks had opened up, but they were not of serious
consequence. I should judge that a few thousands dollars would
easily cover all the repairs to this part of the building. Its val-
uable contents were, to a large extent, thrown to the floors and
smashed, involving a considerable loss, but the structure itself suf-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
fered almost no injury. The only damage to the girls' dormitory
was caused by a chimney that toppled over and crashed down
through the roof, doing some damage on the inside. The concrete
wall showed one or two cracks, which however, were said to be
shrinkage cracks that had appeared soon after the building was
finished. The earthquake apparently had caused no visible dam-
age of any sort in the exterior walls."
Jamaica :—The disaster of January 14, 1907, in Jamaica, left
standing in that city, according to the report of Comte de Mon-
tessus de Ballore, in his "La Science de Seismologique," only two
structures, both of reinforced concrete. At any rate the behavior
of structures of this material was such that at present practically
every building in Kingston of any importance is of reinforced con-
crete.
The following letter written by the owner of an estate in Port
Antonio, was published in Cement Age, March, 1907, in connec-
tion with an article entitled "A Concrete House in the Jamaica
Earthquake."
"I write you to let you know that the house at 'Folly' and all
the other concrete erections upon the place have passed tbrough
the late earthquake without showing the least crack or shake.
From the accounts in the papers, which are all derived from
sources desirous of minimizing the effect of the shock upon the
north side of the island, you will get a very false idea of it. Per-
haps the relation of the following fact will enable you to appre-
ciate the damage of movement to which we were subjected.
"Owing to misjudgment of proper time of repairs, when we
arrived here we found very little water in our reservoir, which was
soon consumed. An unparalleled drought followed and we have
not had a drop of fresh water since about the first of January.
Consequently, we have used our bath tubs all over the house as
tanks for salt water for use in flushing the water closets. At the
time of the earthquake, all bath tubs put to such use were about
half full of sea water. In every case a considerable portion of the
water was splashed over the sides or ends of the bath tubs upon
the floor of the bath rooms. The rumbling noise which preceded
the first and heaviest shock and which seemed like the passage of
a train of cars over the roof, drove us out of doors, and it seemed


73
as though the house must be shaken to pieces. But we soon re-
turned to it to ascertain what damage had been done and found
only the bath room floors flooded, as I have stated.
"I give you this information because it is a great satisfaction
to feel so much security in the strength and solidity of our house.
Very truly yours,
Alfred Mitchell."
The buildings on this estate, besides the main residence, which
was about 246 feet in length, included a ten-room house for the
coachman and other white employees on the estate, a stable about
90 feet by 56 feet with a court yard in the center, two pavilions,
power house, reservoir for domestic water supply, a bridge of
thirty foot span and a gate lodge. All of these buildings were
constructed of reinforced concrete and as the owner states, suf-
fered no injury. No better example of successful earthquake-
resisting construction can be found anywhere than this group of
structures, including as it did, a variety of types, and it is con-
vincing evidence of the worth of the materials used in their con-
struction.
Messina:—In connection with the disaster of December 28,
1908, there appeared the following statement in the Paris edition
of the New York Herald:
"The only buildings that remain standing in the city are a
lunatic asylum and four or five, houses built of reinforced con-
crete. It is a strange sight to see these houses standing unharmed
amid the ruins."
The report of Professor Nakamura on the Messina earthquake
mentions that a reinforced concrete floor in a rubble masonry
house fell without breaking when the masonry walls collapsed
and that a reinforced concrete reservoir at a little distance from
Messina was absolutely undamaged.
The Royal Commission, appointed by the Italian Government
to investigate the Messina earthquake and to prepare a set of reg-
ulations for construction in districts of high seismicity, reported
that of "four reinforced concrete structures in Messina, none were
injured," and called especial attention to the fact that the covering
or culvert over the stream Portalegni where it ran through the
city,' did not collapse under the weight of the. debris.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
As a result of the destruction of Calabria in 1905 and of Mes-
sina in 1908, the "Societa Cooperativa Lombarda di Lavori Pub-
blici" opened a competition for the study of systems of construc-
tion best adapted to localities subject to earthquakes. The award-
ing committee was selected by the College of Engineers and Ar-
chitects of Milan, and comprised the leading seismologists, archi-
tects and engineers in Italy. Over two hundred individuals and
firms from all over the world competed and presented plans, spec-
ifications and models of structures. The awarding committee re-
ported in part as follows:
"The type of structure which appears to predominate among
the plans submitted for buildings of a permanent character is of
'baraccate' construction; including the simple and original struc-
ture of 'Bourbon baraccate' made of a cage of wood buried in ma-
sonry, and the latter form designed in accord with modern meth-
ods, in which the steel alone or in combination with concrete,
brick or cement block, produces with equal facility and with great-
er safety, the degree of stability ensured by the wood skeleton.
Finally plans were submitted of a true and proper monolithic con-
struction in reinforced concrete, which in this instance attracted
the attention of the ablest engineers on account of the ease with
which this material adapts itself to the solution of every problem
of construction."
The first three prizes awarded in this competition were for
structures of reinforced concrete.
It is a remarkable indication of the worth of the material that
structures of reinforced concrete stood up where buildings of
other materials failed, but the most significant fact is that there is
on record, in the numerous works which have been examined, no
instance of the failure of a reinforced concrete structure with the
exception of the Cyclorama, on Strawberry Hill, in San Francisco,
which failed through the undermining of the foundation, caused
by a slip of the earth amounting to five feet or more, and not
through any fault of the construction itself.
CHIMNEYS.
The falling of chimneys is one of the most dangerous and at
the same time common features of seismic disturbances. The


75
heavy masses of brick and masonry crashing through the roof and
floors of a building often cause the collapse of the entire struc-
ture and heavy loss of life. During the California earthquake,
brick chimneys on school buildings fell upon roofs and passed
through every floor to the basement. If the hour had been later
and the schools filled, as usual, the loss of life would have been
terrible.
Chimneys of brick, tile and masonry are practically never re-
inforced adequately, and the ratio of the height to the base being
large, are very susceptible to earthquake shock. A steel stack se-
curely guyed is fairly safe against shock, but is non-fireproof and
the disastrous fires which have followed earthquakes have shown
this to be quite as prime a consideration as ability to resist seismic
movement.
Derleth says: "Chimneys in San Francisco were built of brick
and very often without cement in the mortar. With few excep-
tions, the chimneys were thrown down by rupture within the mid-
dle third of the height. A number of lives were lost by falling
power-house chimneys. In the future, I believe chimneys should
be built of reinforced concrete."
BRIDGES.
Almost without exception, bridges have suffered damage
through the tendency of the banks of a stream to approach each
other under seismic shock. To escape destruction therefore, the
bridge must be capable of resisting extraordinary compression and
longitudinal shear, or must be provided with a plane of weakness
at one or both abutments where a differential movement may take
place without serious injury to the structure. If the latter scheme
is adopted, the bridge will slide over its abutments and will be
damaged to some extent, the amount depending upon the nature
of the vibration in the bridge and whether the vertical component
of the shock is sufficient to cause the bridge to jump from its seat;
but if the structure is a monolithic mass which has sufficient
strength to resist the stress caused by the earth flow, it will be un-
injured. Here again a deep foundation carried well down below
the region of surface movement is essential.
. The damage to bridges during earthquakes has always been


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
very heavy. In the Mino-Owari earthquake of 1891, in Japan, a
brick railway bridge near the Biwajima river failed; the abut-
ments pushed up and back and the arch broke into two quadrant-
shaped masses and collapsed into the river. The great Kisogawa
bridge, consisting of long span through trusses carried on massive
piers, was seriously damaged and the foundations were sheared,
as one writer says, "like sticks."
Professor Hobbs has investigated this subject thoroughly in
"A Study of the Damage to Bridges During Earthquakes," pub-
lished in the Journal of Geology, Vol. 16, 1908.
Professors Marx and Wing noted in the vicinity of the fault
in California, a number of concrete bridges, all of which were un-
injured. Attention has already been called to the bridge on the
estate of Mr. Alfred Mitchell, in Jamaica, which suffered no dam-
age from the shock, and to the concrete covering over the Portal-
egni river in Messina which stood up under the weight of the de-
bris. Mr. Humphrey, in the Bulletin of the Geological Survey, re-
ported: "At the bottom of Strawberry Hill is a bridge crossing
over Stow Lake. This bridge is made of concrete and showed no
sign of cracking although the banks of the lake slipped into the
water.
UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION.
A very serious result of the flow of surface earth, due to seis-
mic shock, is the destruction of gas and water mains and sewers.
Aside from grave sanitary aspects, the city is practically at the
mercy of the disastrous conflagrations which, following earth-
quakes, often do more damage than the temblor itself. Profes-
sor Derleth's words on this subject are of great value.
"The brick sewers (in San Francisco) were universally help-
less to resist destruction in these regions and the cast iron water
and gas pipes fared no better. I believe reinforced concrete sew-
ers inthesedistricts would have shown much greater resisting qual-
ities, but I am convinced that even such material could not with-
stand the earthquake stresses on the dividing line between made
and filled ground. At such points, flexible joints might have
helped the sewer and w:ater pipes, but it is difficult to conceive of
a practical means for procuring flexibility at any point in a brick
or concrete sewer. * *:!: Greater probability of resistance to rup-


77
ture might be further ensured by encasing pipes traversing the
most treacherous ground in tunnels of reinforced concrete with
suitable clearance between the pipe and tunnel walls. An added
advantage of this scheme would be ease of inspection."
The practicability of this plan for important pipes was proven
in the recent earthquake in Mexico, as the tunnels of reinforced
concrete in Mexico City gave perfect protection to the pipes con-
tained therein, while conduits outside the city failed generally.
It has not been the intention of the writer to attempt to prove
that reinforced concrete is the only type of construction that will
successfully resist earthquake shocks. Structures of other ma-
terials: well designed structural steel buildings and even light
wooden houses have often displayed excellent resistive qualities
but reinforced concrete has been so uniformly satisfactory, in so
many different forms of construction, as to deserve especial com-
mendation.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
TIMING THE EXPOSURE OF DRY PLATES.
BY CLARENCE T. JOHNSTON, '95,
PROFESSOR OF SURVEYING.
Engineers of today who are actively engaged in practice con-
cede that the camera is a great convenience, if not a necessity in
their work. It often takes the place of the draughtsman who was
formerly relied upon to sketch engineering subjects. It records
topographic notes for the surveyor. It enlarges and reduces draw-
ings for the office man and it illustrates technical subjects for those
who wish to present the same to men who do not have a technical
training. The importance of the camera to the engineer must in-
crease with each year.
It is impossible to discuss many phases of photography in a
short article. Possibly one of the problems that puzzles the cam-
era enthusiast the most relates to the time of exposure that should
be given dry plates. When the available texts pertaining to this
subject are referred to. we find that the time of exposure varies
with the day of the year, the time of the day, the latitude of the
place, the speed of the lens, the character of the view, the sensitom-
eter of the plates, the diameter of the stop and the condition of the
atmosphere. To judge all of these varying conditions and then
select the proper interval of time for exposure seems to be a seri-
ous undertaking. Fortunately a view may be obtained even
though the plate may be slightly under exposed or slightly over-
timed. The factor of safety is evidently large in this kind of
work.
It is always advisable to select one well known dry plate and
learn to judge the light therefor, rather than to use a number of
brands. When one has learned how to expose a standard plate,
he will be able to use plates that are either slower or more rapid,
because he then has only to deal with a factor of the time. We will
select Seed's 26X plates and this discussion will refer thereto
without deviation.
Before discussing the elements which determine the time of ex-


79
posure for photographic plates it seems advisable to refer to some
of the misconceptions which prevail relative to cameras and lenses.
All lenses having the same diameter and the same equivalent focal
length are of equal rapidity. The shorter the focus and the larger
the aperture of the lens the more perfect is its lighting ability and
hence its speed. There is some misconception as to these rela-
tions. This is due to the fact that with a short exposure, a lens
corrected for aberration will produce a better negative than an
imperfect lens. The corrected lens may be used wide open,—that
is with the largest stop while, to obtain an equally good view, the
imperfect lens must be stopped down. The imperfect lens might
be given an equally short exposure with the large stop, but the
negative obtained would not be satisfactory. The lighting value
of the two lenses when the same stop is used would be the same,
if the ratio of their apertures and focal lengths were the same
and the negatives would develop with equal rapidity. The differ-
ence would be found in the definition of objects on the two neg-
atives.
It is sometimes believed that a longer exposure is required for
distant objects than for objects close to the camera. This is not
true. The light which reaches the dry plate coines from the sur-
faces which reflect light in the field of view. It is natural, there-
fore, that distant objects, which must be relatively large to be seen
at all, will reflect more light pro]x&gt;rtionately than objects nearer
the camera. Again, it is assumed by some that the character of
the negative is influenced by placing the camera in the shade or in
the sun light. A little thought will show this conception to be
wrong. When we consider that it is the reflected light from many
objects in the field that affects the plate, we begin to understand
that the location of the camera is not material in so far as shade
or direct light is concerned. The camera may be placed so that its
line of sight barely escapes the sun and a good negative may be
obtained if the lens is shaded in such a way as to prevent direct
rays from reaching the plate.
There are several elements entering into the determination of
the time of exposure which must finally be left to the judgment
of the operator. These should be eliminated in the beginning and
an attempt made to analyze those conditions that are fixed by


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
some natural law. Clouds, smoke and even the humidity and tem-
perature of the air influence the time of exposure. When we are
able to say what the exposure should be under normal conditions,
i. c, the air clear and the humidity and temperature not above or
below the average, we are in position to estimate with some accu-
racy the time of exposure when the problem is more complicated.
The condition of the atmosphere presents some apparent compli-
cations to the photographer. If he will forget the clouds, the
smoke, the humidity and temperature of the air until he has satis-
fied himself as to the time of exposure for a clear atmosphere and
normal conditions, he will save himself some study and annoy-
ance. We will consider this feature to be eliminated for the time
being.
The altitude of the sun can be determined for any hour of the
year quite easily. This is one of the factors in our problem that
we may study with profit. We know that the intensity of light
varies with the height of the sun above the horizon. It makes no
difference to the photographer whether the sun is in the north,
east, south or west, it will give the same light if its altitude is the
same. We may compute the altitude of the sun for any instant by
finding its declination for that instant and substituting in the fol-
lowing formula:
I. sin A = sin L sin d + cos L cos d cos h
In which A is the altitude of the sun, L is the latitude of the ob-
server's place, d is the declination of the sun and h is the hour
angle. For our purposes, we may assume that the declination of
the sun at noon for any clay is constant for that day and for the
same day of any year. This assumption enables us to compute
ordinates of curves which indicate the altitude of the sun at noon
for each day in the year to conform to any known latitude. Plate
I. contains a number of such curves corresponding to latitudes
varying from zero to ninety degrees. For the latitude of Ann
Arbor, the altitude curve for noon values is shown on the upper
part of Plate IT. The ordinates for this curve may be computed
as follows and checked by the above equation (I.) if desired: The
altitude of the sun at noon is equal to 900—(Z,—d). For instance,
in latitude 420 16' 48" (Ann Arbor) the altitude of the sun at
noon on the 21st day of December is approximately 900—


(42' i6' 48" -|- 23" 30'). The sign of 230 30' in the parenthesis
is plus because the declination of the sun is minus between the 21st
of September and the 21st of March. The exact time of mini-
mum and maximum declination of the sun varies from year to
year, but for our purposes we may assume that the equinoxes oc-
cur at noon on the 21st days of March and September and that the
solstices occur on the 21st days of June and December.
The upper part of Plate II furnishes us with a graphical pre-
sentation of the altitude of the sun at noon for each day of the
year at Ann Arbor. The sun has an additional apparent motion
due to the daily revolution of the earth on its axis. Its maximum
altitude for any day is attained at noon. By taking various val-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Plate II.
lies of d and h in formula I another series of curves is obtained,
each one corresponding to a particular value of d. The latitude
of Ann Arbor is taken as a constant. //, the hour angle, is
measured from the plane of the observer's meridian. At noon h
is zero, at one o'clock it is 150, at two o'clock it is 300 and so on.
d may vary from — 23° 30' in December to o in March and Sep-
tember and to -f- 230 30' in June. Curves have been computed
for the latitude of Ann Arbor for seven values of d, — 230 30',
— 200 00'. — io° 00', oo° 00', -f- io° 00', + 20° 00', and + 230
30'. These are plotted on the lower part of Plate II. Suppose
we wish to find the altitude of the sun at four o'clock on Decem-
ber 10th. We first refer to the general curve, Plate II, and locate
the ordinate for December 10th. This shows that the altitude of
the sun at noon on that day is slightly above 240. We then turn
to the series of curves appearing at the bottom of Plate II and
select the curve which indicates a noon altitude of 240 or nearly


«3
so. By following this curve to the right until 4:00 P. M. is reach-
ed we find the altitude of the sun to he about 40 30'.
Having found the altitude of the sun we would naturally in-
quire as to the intensity of light for any particular value thereof
Since the light of the sun would be of zero intensity at sunset
(if it were not for refraction) and a maximum at noon, it would
seem that it would vary largely with the sine of the altitude. We
know that the time of exposure does not increase with great ra-
pidity towards sunset and further we know that photographs may
be taken after sunset. For this reason, it is plain that refracted
light must also be considered. Refraction presents a difficult prob-
lem to the astronomer. However, the photographer may employ
a refraction formula that the astronomer could not use except
within quite restricted limits. If / is the intensity of light when
A is 900 and 1 is the intensity of light for any value of A,—then
Refraction formulae are unsatisfactory from a theoretical
standpoint. They are based on experiment to a large extent. In
the above formula (II.) the part within parenthesis represents
seconds of arc. b is the barometer reading in inches and t is the
temperature of the air in degrees Far. For our work we may as-
sume b as 29 inches and t as 60 degrees Far. When we analyze
the curve for equation II we find that for A-=90°, i = I. The
second term of the right hand member has no influence practi-
cally on the value of i until the angle approximates 2 or 3 degrees
when the refracted light begins to play an important part. How-
ever, we find that as the curve approaches A=o° &amp; branch turns
abruptly with increasing values of i until the number of seconds
in the term in parenthesis is equivalent to an angle of 900. The
value of A at this limit is about 35". The curve returns again with
decreasing values of i and with negative values of A. Plate III.
shows the character of the curve. By making it continuous (as
indicated by the dotted portion of curve) from points correspond-
ing to values of A approximating + i° and — i° the trustworthy
portion of the curve is obtained.
Equation II with the corresponding curve, Plate III, indi-
II. i = I sin A -\- / sin

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Plate III.
cates how the intensity of sunlight varies with the altitude of the
sun. If T is the time of exposure in seconds when the intensity
of light is /, that is when A is 900, and t is the time of exposure
for any other value of At then
T:t::i:I or
III. i = IT/t.
Substituting this value of i in equation II we have:
T
IV. t - -- -
sin A — sin (54.82 ctn A)
In this formula, b is taken as 29 inches and / is assumed to be
60 degrees Far. T may vary considerably depending on the aper-
ture of the lens and the focal length of the same. For lenses in
common use we may assume values for T depending on the char-
acter of the subject to be photographed. For instance, we may say
that a marine view, a photograph of clouds, etc.. requires an ex-
posure of i/iooth of a second when A is 90°. Distant landscapes


85
would then require an exposure of about l/50th of a second un-
der similar conditions. We would then find that open landscapes
would require i/20th of a sound; dark objects in the foreground,
i/ioth of a second and portraits out of doors in the shade, i/5th
of a second. With these values of T we may compute various
values of f for any altitude, A. Plate IV contains curves which
have been computed in this manner. They are continuous, as is
the useful portion of the curve in Plate III. It is possible that a
lens might be found which would be much quicker than that for
which we have assumed the average values displayed in the curves
of Plate IV. If so the operator may use a factor which he could
determine by a single experiment or he may plot special curves for
the lens in question.
From Plate II we may obtain the altitude of the sun at Ann
Arbor for any hour of the year. From Plate IV we may find the
time of exposure in seconds corresponding to that altitude. The
discussion that precedes relates to the use of a stop which is i/8th
of the focal length of the lens,—that is, stop f8. The stop may be
f8, f6.4, f4.6, or almost any combination depending upon the
ratio of the focal length of the lens to its diameter, when the lens
aperature is practically unobstructed. Assuming that the focal
length is a constant, as it is with any one lens, then
Let S = diameter of a certain stop, for which the time of exposure
is T seconds.
Let J = the diameter of any stop.
Let / = the exposure therefor.
Then .S" : s" :: T : t
V. and t = s'/S1 ■ T.
We may compute the time, t, for any stop by employing for-
mula V. If T is taken as unity, s2/S2 becomes a factor which in-
dicates the relation of times of exposure to the stops employed.
Some lens makers mark the scale relating to different stops in
terms of this multiplier. The general practice, however, is to
simply mark the ratio of the lens aperature and the focal length'
as f8, fi6, f22, etc. Assuming T as unity the curve shown on
Plate V has been computed. The ordinates represent the ratios
of the focal lengths to the aperature of the lens, while the ab-
scissae represent values of s'-/S2. If we know the exposure for
any stop we can, from this curve, ascertain the exposure for all




87
Plate V.
other stops. For instance, if we know that the proper exposure
for stop fi6 is 1/2 second and desire to know the time of ex-
posure for stop (64; the factor, s2/S2, corresponding to stop f 16
is 4. and the factor for stop {64 is 64. If we divide 1/2 by 4 and
multiply the quotient by 64 we have the time of exposure for stop
f64, which is 8 seconds.
If we wish to obtain the time for an exposure within a room,
we first satisfy ourselves as to the exposure that would be re-
quired for a portrait out of doors in the shade. If we remove
three of the side walls of the room we have conditions very simi-
lar, as far as lighting is concerned, to those for a portrait in the
shade outside of the building. As wall area is added the light is
diminished in the ratio of the window area to the wall area. If
the walls within the building reflect a large part of the light
thrown upon them directly from the windows or if there are many


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
windows, the time of exposure for all places within the room ap-
proaches uniformity. The problem may he approached from an-
other direction. Assume a simple case,—a room 20 feet long and
15 feet wide having one window 4 feet square at the middle of one
of the long sides. If the walls do not reflect light we would be
working within a camera obscura of large dimensions. The glass
of the window might transmit but 90% of the light that falls
upon it. An exposure made within the room close to the window
would have to be increased accordingly and only this factor would
have to be considered. As the camera is moved away from the
window on a line at right angles thereto, the time would also have
to be increased in ratio of the square of the distance from the
window. Generally throughout the room it would be necessary
to consider both the distance from the window and the angle
formed, by a line between the camera and the window, and the
plane of the window. With this brief discussion of interior light-
ing, the beginner should have no trouble in determining the proper
time of exposure, providing he bases his judgment on accurate
information that can be obtained before he tries to estimate the
more •complicated conditions within doors.
Heretofore we have discussed those conditions that can be
treated with some degree of mathematical accuracy. The student
of photography may carry the refinements of his investigations as
far as his fancy or his interest may dictate. The rule to observe
is to determine the time of exposure for normal conditions first.
If it is cloudy, or if the atmosphere is smoky we must use our
judgmentastotheintensity and quality of the available light. Light,
fleecy clouds do not reduce the light materially while light clouds
on which the sun is shining and from which light is reflected often
intensify the light on a landscape. Dark, heavy clouds may cut
out from three-fourths to seven-eighths or even more of the sun
light. Smoke is more difficult to judge because it not only elim-
inates much of the direct light but it obscures distant objects. The
color of smoke has much to do with its influence in camera work.
A light colored smoke may have but little effect on the intensity
of light. A yellow, brown or black smoke always threatens trou-
ble and when such smoke is present in the air it is advisable to
make no exposures until conditions improve.

EXPERIMENTS OX FLOW OF STEAM THROUGH
NOZZLES.
BY J. E. EMSWU.ER AND C. H. FESSENDEN.
This article reports some tests which were conducted in the
laboratory of the University of Michigan on the flow of steam
through nozzles when the back pressure is less than 58% of the
initial. It consists of two parts. The first presents the results of
some investigations on the flow of saturated steam. Comparing
two well-known formulas
70 60
with the actual flow shows that the first, Napier's rule, is sufficiently
accurate for only a limited range of pressures, but that the second
is within 1% over the entire range investigated. This part cannot
be regarded as pioneer work but rather as a verification of the
conclusions of previous investigators.
The second part, to be published later, deals with the flow of
superheated steam, in which field very little work has been re-
ported.
Fig. 1 shows the apparatus. It was originally designed for
another purpose but served very well for flow tests. Steam was
led past a throttle valve, M, to the cylinder, A, from which it
passed through slots into the hollow shaft, B. From B the steam
entered the cross arm, C, in chamber D, and escaped through the
nozzle. The exhaust chamber, D, was connected to a condenser
discharging into weighing tanks. Fig. 2 shows the nozzles used
and Fig. 3 the manner of attaching the nozzle to the piping.
By means of the throttle valve, M, the steam pressure on the
nozzle was held constant while the discharge through it was con-
densed and weighed. Tests were made with many pressures and
the results checked on different days and by different observers.
The gauge for measuring the pressure was connected to the


91
cylinder, A, as indicated in Fig. 1. Due to the length of pipe be-
tween the nozzle and the steam gauge connection, there was a
slight drop in steam pressure. This was investigated and the
correction applied. The pressure in the exhaust chamber, D, was
atmospheric, or only slightly above, in every case. The back pres-
sure on the nozzle, being therefore less than 58% of the initial,
did not affect the flow.


A throttling' calorimeter was used to determine the quality of
the steam in the cylinder, A. Measurement of quality at the cyl-
inder, instead of at the nozzle, introduced a slight error due to
radiation from the pipe between cylinder and nozzle. An approx-
imate calculation of this radiation loss shows the maximum error
in quality to be 2/10%. This affects the flow calculations by less
than 1/10%.
The manner of condensing and weighing the steam discharged
through the nozzle is evident from the diagram (Fig. 1). All
condensation accumulating in the exhaust chamber, D, was drained
off, and weighed and added to that collected in the main weighing
tanks.
All instruments were carefully calibrated and every precaution
taken to obtain trustworthy data'

The results of the tests are shown in Tables i and 2. Column
5 gives the actual flow in pounds per hour, while Column 6 gives
these results corrected to 100% quality. The correction was made
on the basis that the flow is inversely proportional to the square
root of the quality.* The results given in Column 6 were plotted
against the absolute pressures to give the curve in Fig. 4.
A comparison of the results shows no appreciable difference
in the discharge from the two nozzles. This was to be expected
and demonstrates again the often repeated statement that the por-
tion of the nozzle following the throat, has no effect on the amount
of flow.
There are three well known empirical formulas for the flow of
steam which may be used when the back pressure is less than 58%
of the initial pressure. One of these is Napier's Rule:
F = Ap/7o- 3600 (A)
Where F = the flow of dry steam in pounds per hour.
A = area of throat in square inches,
and p = initial steam pressure in lbs. per square inch, absolute.
The second formula is that of Grashof ("Grashof Theoretische
Maschinenlehre, Vol. I, iii):
F=: .01654 /f^""" • 3600 (B)
The third formula:
P - Ap "/6o ■ 3600 (C)
is given by Professor J. A. Moyer in his book on Steam Turbines,
page 30, and is a modification of the one given by Grashof.
In Fig. 5 is shown a comparison between the experimental
results recorded in Tables 1 and 2 and the flow as given by the
three formulas mentioned above. The curve of Fig. 4 has been
reproduced three times so that each formula can be compared with
it separately.
♦If this method of correcting is not exactly accurate, the error so
introduced would be inappreciably small on account of the small range
over which the correction is applied—the lowest quality observed in any
of the tests being 98^%.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The points shown near the curves B and C are points which
were computed by the formulas of Grashof and Moyer. Owing
to the close proximity of these points to the curve, lines have
not been drawn through them.
Napier's formula is compared wih curve A and is shown as a
dash line, which being straight shows how much the actual curve
bends.
As can be seen Napier's curve crosses the actual curve in two
places, at 30 pounds and at 130 pounds. Except in the neighbor-
hood of these pressures it does not give very accurate results. The
maximum divergence occurs at about 70 pounds where the error
is nearly 2%.
Grashof's curve is a trifle flatter than .the actual, but differs
from it only near the middle where the greatest error is within
iV2%.
The most accurate formula, of the three, is Moyer's. Through-
out the entire range investigated the agreement is within 1%.
In order to determine what effect the rounding at the entrance
to the nozzle has on the flow, three other nozzles were made ex-
actly like nozzle No. 3 except that the entrances were rounded to
o, 3/32, and 3/16 inch radius respectively. Nozzle No. 3 had a
rounding of 1/8" radius. These three additional nozzles w:crc
tested at one pressure, namely, 35.5 pounds, and the flows com-
pared-with that from Fig. 4 at the same pressure. The nozzle
with no rounding at the entrance gave 11% less flow than No. 3;
the one with 3/32" rounding gave 3% less than No. 3; and the
one with 3/16" rounding gave practically the same as No. 3. This
leads to the conclusion that with the size nozzles tested if the
rounding is 1/8" radius, or more, the flow is unaffected by it.

THE TAYLOR STOKER.
BY J. H. DE VISSER, '07.
During the past few years, engineers interested in power plants
have been giving a large part of their time to the study of the
boiler room. Prime movers have been developed to a very high
degree of efficiency and up to recent years power plant engineers
have been so engrossed in the gain of a small degree of efficiency
in their prime movers that they have in most cases lost sight of
chance for far greater progress in their boiler rooms. This con-
dition is rapidly changing and the engineer who is studying his
boiler and furnace conditions is making far more remarkable rec-
ords than when he spent all of his thought and energy in his engine
room. The man who thinks about these things realizes that in no
place in his plant is there so great a chance for gain or loss as in
his boiler room.
The observant engineer has found that the results obtained
with a type of furnace dependent upon the fireman vary over a
wide range; that a careful and experienced man can obtain much
better results than a mere "coal shoveler." Unfortunately the lat-
ter greatly outnumber the former. Consequently, it is advisable
to eliminate the personal equation in stoking to the greatest possi-
ble extent, for men who are intelligent enough to study the firing
conditions are not willing to spend all of their lives heaving coal.
There is as much chance for variation in results obtained with
some stokers as there is in hand firing because of this same per-
sonal element and here, too, it is imperative to eliminate to the
greatest degree the possibility of poor results through carelessness
and inattention and to select the stoker that is most nearly auto-
matic in all of its functions. In making this selection there are
two distinct types to consider,—over-feed and under-feed stokers.
With the first type, coal is fed on top of the fire and combus-
tion is dependent on coking arches or special tile and natural draft
with a consequent large excess of air.
The under-feed stoker feeds the green coal beneath the coked


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
and burning coal, the incandescent bed itself being an arch or
baffle which consumes the gases of combustion much more com-
pletely than the arch or tile construction. With the under-feed
stoker, air for combustion can be suppled in proper quantities and
at correct pressures, the operation being independent of atmos-
pheric conditions.
The Taylor stoker is an inclined under-feed stoker and is the
only one of its type. It is the only stoker which feeds green coal
beneath the burning coal while the entire fuel bed moves by grav-
ity down an incline.
The under-feed principle is adopted because it is the only real
scientific method of burning coal—a method by means of which
coal can be completely burned without expensive auxiliary arches
or special tile.
The fuel bed is inclined so the fire can automatically rid itself
of refuse by gravity with a minimum amount of labor. The ques-
ton of combustion as applied to stokers is not one alone of burn-
ing coal but also of handling the ash resulting from combustion
and this feature of gravity cleaning is a most important one from
the standpoint of labor and convenience of handling the refuse.
Cleaning or slicing the fire, in its commonly accepted meaning, is
not necessary wth the Taylor stoker. The cleaning process, how-
ever, is going on all the time—automatically through the action


99-
of gravity. This is carried on without the retarded combustion or
deposit of soot on chilled heating surfaces caused by opening
doors at frequent cleaning periods.
The accompanying illustrations show the construction of the
stoker. Coal is fed from the hopper into the retort, from which
two cylindrical rams, assisted by gravity, introduce it into the fur-
nace at an angle to the fire surface. Movement of the upper ram
pushes the green coal outward and upward, properly distributing
it in the coking zone. The action of the lower arm is similar, but
instead of bringing in fresh coal, it pushes the fuel bed and refuse
toward the dumping plates at the rear.
The retorts are the spaces between two adjacent tuyere boxes;
that is there are alternating strips of retorts and tuyeres. A series
of tuyeres is supported on each tuyere box, with openings in the
vertical faces to distribute air to the fuel. These tuyeres are of
cast iron and inter-lock, when in position. As they are always
completely covered by unburned coke, they never become uncom-
fortably warm.
The air from the wind-box enters the tuyeres and escaping


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
through the openings, mingles with the gases distilled from the
coal and with the coked fuel pushed outward by the rams. The
air supply is under pressure furnished by a blower, and as gravity
acts constantly to prevent holes in the fire, the amount of air for
combustion can be regulated to approach very closely the theo-
retical amount. Both rams are actuated by connecting rods and
links from a crank shaft which is driven from the speed shaft.
The speed shaft in turn is driven by the fan engine.
The dump plates are hung at the rear of the wind box and on
these plates the burned-out refuse is received and dumped period-
ically, as the conditions of service may require. The dump plates
are operated from the front of the stoker, raised, latched in posi-
tion and released by a hand lever.
Forced draft, an essential feature of the Taylor system of
combustion, permits a perfect mechanical control of air supply,
is independent of weather conditions, and is intense enough to
burn low grade coal, conditions which cannot be met by natural
draft.
The same engine being used to operate both stoker and fan,
any change in speed simultaneously changes both the rate of feed-
ing coal and rate of supplying air. This action is automatically
controlled by a draft regulator placed in the boiler room and piped
to the main steam line. By means of positive connections from
the regulator arm to a chronometer valve in the steam line to the
fan engine, any slight variation in the steam pressure causes a
change in fan and stoker speeds. This lends itself to great flexi-
bility in load conditions.
Analysis of continuous samples of flue gas determine the prop-
er ratio of air and coal. Once settled, the relative speeds of blow-
er and stoker are fixed, and as the connection is positive, there is
no possibility of imperfect regulation.
This determination of ratio of air to coal guarantees the high-
est efficiency throughout a wide range of load and guards against
error of judgment on the part of the fireman. It is impossible to
introduce more coal than can be completely burned, nor can more
air than is necessary for perfect combustion be admitted. The
result of this mechanical control of air and coal is a relatively high
carbon dioxide gas (CO.) over a very wide range of load.


IOI
The problem of smoke abatement in large cities is of far reach-
ing importance. In residential and business districts, it is impera-
tive that boiler plants be operated smokelessly. The three reasons
why the Taylor fire is smokeless are: first—the Taylor is an under-
feed stoker; second—there being a large number of retorts, the
amount of coal burned per retort is comparatively small and ample
time is given to coke the coal, and the volatile gases which usually
cause smoke unite with the air as it enters through the tuyeres
and form a combustible mixture which is completely burned in its
passage through the incandescent bed; third—the scientifically de-
termined ratio of air to coal remains constant over a wide range
of load. The Taylor eliminates the conditions which cause smoke.
Combustion is the primary object of any stoker, but all stokers
cannot be operated economically at high rates of combustion, and
most stokers simply will not operate under these conditions.
The Taylor Stoker can burn more coal than any other stoker
and burn it economically, because the entire furnace area is effec-
tive, air for combustion is always applied when wanted, in the
quantity required, and the refuse is cared for readily and auto-
matically. No other stoker can maintain a clean, vigorous fire
continuously.
The durability of the Taylor Stoker and the small cost of up-
keep, which is less than one-third that of any other stoker, are to
a great extent the result of extreme simplicity and freedom from
moving parts within the furnace, combined with the fact that the
tuyeres are well protected by green coal and currents of air.
The development of the Taylor Stoker has demonstrated that
labor in the boiler room and cost of furnace up-keep can be re-
duced to a minimum, that smokelessness is possible with the widest
load variations, and that high operating efficiencies can be main-
tained, not for short periods through the services of an expert
fireman, but continuously.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
WORK AND THE MAN.
BY JOHN C. PARKER, 'OI.
Engineers, and more frequently the younger ones, are being
so systematically lectured nowadays as to the thousand and one
absolute essentials to professional success, that an extra publica-
tion along this line is pretty likely to prove the last straw on the
back of a pretty heavily burdened profession. It may be, how-
ever, that the writer will have a somewhat different perspective
angle, so that this brief article may not be entirely a repetition of
what has gone before.
Of course, it is perfectly true that the ideal engineer must be
a profound theoretician, must have calculus and transcendental
forms of mathematical gymnastics at his finger tips, that he must
have spent several generations in practical experience, that he
must be able to qualify as a certified public accountant, and all that
sort of thing, and so by virtue of the fact that a finite quantity
added to an already infinite one is negligible in the final shake-up,
I should like to add still another and very trifling requirement:
namely, that he be a man.
After all, the requirements in our profession are not very dif-
ferent from what they are in any other human line of activity.
It is true that the technique of engineering differs somewhat from
that of dentistry, surgery, and the dry goods business; but this is,
indeed, a minor matter. The man is the thing.
Which sounds pretty elementary? Yes. But the trouble is
that most things that are commonly accepted are, like the golden
rule, very difficult to bring down to everyday living, and hence
more honored in the breach than in the observance.
Perhaps back of the non-observance of some of these funda-
mental principles is the sneaking suspicion that they are not work-
able in the world as it is, and the writer's contribution is merely
intended as a line of testimony to indicate that one or two of the
fundamental principles of life really work in this humdrum work-
aday world of ours, and in our own profession no Tess than in
some of the others.


I°3
If one criticism more than another applies to the men of our
profession, it is that they aren't men first, and engineers after-
wards, but that a well-rounded balanced manhood is made to wait
until a man has made a professional success of himself. Of
course, there are exceptions; but these exceptions simply serve to
prove the rule, since these few well-grounded broadly cultivated
men with a surplus of humanity are the men who stand at the
very top of our profession.
I remember that during my own undergraduate days there
was a great deal of impatience with the work in German, French,
and English, and very little evidence of a desire to take up aca-
demic studies for their purely cultural value. I suppose that we
were so anxious to get to the heap, that we were inclined to neg-
lect the nuggets of pure gold that lay right beneath our feet.
From ten years' distance, it is easy to see how wrong this atti-
tude was, and I find myself inclined to believe now that the banker
and the capitalist who employ our engineers are not so very
wrong in regarding us as a sort of skilled mechanic—highly
skilled, it is true, but none the less a trifle greasy. It cannot but
be humiliating to a man who loves and reverences his profession
to see'the diffidence and more or less tacit acknowledgement of in-
feriority with which many an engineer enters the presence of the
man who hires him. In fact, you will note that it is very often
the engineer who is admitted into the presence chamber, whereas
in the case of our legal brethren the reverse obtains, so that he,
entrenched behind his dignified mahogany, receives the captain of
industry as a suppliant for assistance.
I believe that a great deal of success in the world in any line
■of human activity depends on the impression which the man him-
self creates, and that in lines often far afield from his vocational
work. It is manifest that a non-engineer can scarcely know
whether the engineer possesses ability or not merely from the way
in which the engineer talks about his own work, since, if the for-
eigner were able to discriminate between fine and superfine engi-
neering, he would himself be an engineer. It must, therefore, be
"that a man's vocational repute will depend on the impression for
general intelligence which he can create in lines outside his pri-
mary endeavor, lines which closely parallel the interests of the
•other man.


For this reason it seems to me that one of the greatest require-
ments in ours, as well as in other professions, is a breadth of men-
tal interest, that a man should know something about art, a great
deal about literature, still more about economics, and most of all,
should know thoroughly the political history and current condi-
tions in his own country and in the world at large, so that when
men gather together the engineer may show himself to be quite
the peer of them all in his general intelligence.
This is the more important nowadays when engineering prob-
lems impinge on nearly every one of the great political move-
ments of the day. When amateurs may be called upon to regu-
late interstate commerce over the engineer's road bed; when law-
yers, business men, and farmers in the legislature pass acts to con-
trol telephone, gas, and electric corporations; when states, as well
as the nation are busy about conservation of water power, mines,
and forests; when numerous expenditures are made for canals
across our states and connecting the oceans; when the saving of
life in our factories becomes a national movement, it will not do
for the engineer to be applied to for technical information alone.
He must have a mind broad to every aspect of the problem, so
that not only as a technician, but also as an economist and a broad-
gauged citizen, his ideas will have weight preeminently over those
of the laity. This is at once a duty for the honor of his profession,
and a means of selfish advancement for himself.
Another phase of the breadth of the man as shown in the
breadth of his cultivation appears in his use of his mother tongue.
It is as certain as anything can be that it does no good to either
the man or society for him to have perfectly splendid ideas if he
cannot communicate the ideas to others. The only medium that
we have for the communication of ideas is through the use of our
language, whether written or spoken. This does not mean, mere-
ly, that a man should be able through the use of dry technical and
absolutely accurate language to express the truths that he has
worked out, but rather that he should be able to arrest and keep
the interest of the man to whom he wants to communicate his own
conviction of the truth.
Tn ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the engineer, if he be
at all progressive, and not merely a detailed subordinate, will have


I05
some constructive suggestion which he will want to get executed
in the face of opposition, either actual or potential. He will nat-
urally be more interested in his idea than will the board of direc-
tors for whom he works, or the administrative officers of the city,
if he happens to be a municipal engineer. To arouse these men
and stimulate their interest, the engineer must be able to express
himself not only accurately and elegantly, but also interestingly;
and here is where a wide acquaintance with literature is of ines-
timable value. Little phrases that arouse interest will often result
in the interest being transferred to the thing itself. Above all
else, in this presentation of technical ideas, the engineer should
let his personality slip into the work now and then, so that the
work may be inspirational.
Speaking of personality, one notes another element in the suc-
cess of the well-rounded man; namely, that he very speedily recog-
nizes that since business must be done by human beings, the hu-
man equation is paramount. Too often we engineers are likely
to think that the engineering work is a dispassionate, abstract
proposition, which succeeds or fails on its own merits. Maybe
this is as it should be. Personally I do not think so; but I do
not wish to quarrel over the mere question of abstract ethics.
The fact is that work is not done in any field of human endeavor
on its abstract merits or demerits, but that the personality of the
man doing it counts for a whole lot. I have known of very ex-
cellent engineering propositions losing out because the engineer
presented them with the attitude of a man saying, "I in my inner
consciousness have decided this to be the thing that you must
take, with or without your approbation;" and I have seen in-
stances where this attitude has proved absolutely fatal, arousing,
as it did, a personal antagonism to the idea through the agent,
such that the idea was just naturally destined to fail. We can to
great advantage copy the best practitioners of the medical profes-
sion in the human phases of their practice. What is the example
that the doctor of medicine sets us? Well, in the first place, it is
one of sympathy. Not so much for the direct psychic reaction on
the patient, as for the purpose of gaining the patient's confidence
in the doctor's diagnosis and in the medicines. We engineers
should be sympathetic with the business man with whom we have


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
to deal. We should let him see that his interests are not a matter
of indifference to us, but that, on the other hand, we are keenly
alive to what he wants and to his personal angle of vision. If we
could do more of this, the business man would be less inclined to
think that we were letting our love of technical beauty run away
with all sense of proportion.
The medical man is not afraid to smile once in a while on his
job. 1 do not believe that we engineers are habitually a sad and
morose lot, but I do think that we are on occasion just a trifle too
intense, with the result that people believe us to be sour. Now, the
smile is only a sign of something, and not a thing to be cultivated
in itself. What we want to do is to modify the frame of mind, so
that in this, as in a hundred other externals, we will appear to be
better mixers; not for one instant substituting the mixer's ability
for real merit, for such a trait is at once dishonest, and the pre-
cursor of a more or less ultimate, but none the less certain fall,
but rather using the trait of mixability as a supplement to the in-
herent qualifications of the man.
On one of the human traits that the engineer should cultivate,
I would flatly disagree with many of the people who have so re-
cently sermonized us; namely, that of the close focusing of the
mind on the main chance. Paper after paper has been written
telling the young engineer that he must study, and work, and
watch—almost pray—without ceasing along the line of the work
that he has in hand. This I would advise, did I consider the
sum of human success to be eminent perfection in the knowledge
of the number of thicknesses of insulating cloth to be used' in the
slots of a 20-horsepower, 2,200-volt, Form XYZ, 60-cycle induc-
tion motor, or the exact determination of the time curve of the
motion of the trip gear on a Corliss valve. But, unfortunately, I
don't believe that to be any great aim in life for any man. I have
no quarrel with perfection in detail, nor any contempt for small
details; on the contrary, I believe the ability to handle details well
to be one of the signs of a big man in any walk of life; but I do
believe, by the same token, that if a man devotes all of his life to
a narrow detail of his specialized business, he will sooner or later
become unfit for anything else, and will not even realize the im-
portance of his one detail in its relation to the great world about


I07
us. A man should conscientiously and carefully work, and work
like a Trojan on the work that he has in hand during his working
hours. He should supplement this by some study during his leis-
ure hours; but he should keep himself mightily well assured that
he has leisure hours to spend on anything, be it the whim of the
moment, or a consecutive line of endeavor widely separated from
his routine work. Not only will such a process give a man a bet-
ter perspective of the thing that he is at the moment engaged in,
but it w ill keep his mind open, so that when he is called to a broad-
er field of usefulness, he will be able to fit himself into it without
shock, and at all times to adapt himself to other people.
This watching the main chance may be a very good thing if a
man is a Robinson Crusoe; but once granted the Man Friday, and
certain byways of interest open up into which a man must put
himself whole-heartedly if he will get along in the society of even
two. Since we are living our lives not by twos nor by threes, but
by thousands, I am sure that in the long run a man will profit
the most, even aside from the fundamental fineness of the act, by
thinking about others, by playing the game in the big rather than
in the little. I have known many people, some of them among
our engineers, who habitually say, "I don't know why I should
do anything for anybody else; no one has ever done anything for
me." Of course not; and why should one, when a man has that
sort of a philosophy? I have known other cases where men threw
themselves into their work with a pure joy in the work itself, and
where they would throw themselves into the other fellow's work,
because they had big enough hearts to want to help the other fel-
low ; and the result has been invariable. Sooner or later the time
would come when circumstance would call for an expression in
word or in act from the beneficiaries, and that expression has more
than paid the price of any act of generous cooperation. Not one
instance have I seen where with initial merit a generous kindly
spirit of helping the other fellow has failed to pay enormous divi-
dends.
All these things do, to put it on its lowest terms, pay, and pay
richly. To insure this the game must be played in no half-hearted
way. There must be no calculation on results, and no crowding
the date of divident payment., Our broad humanity must not be


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
a policy, but a fixed and abiding principle of life; then only will it
bring success in the narrow sense of the word, but then richly.
And if, after all, the game had no material rewards, what then?
Should we play it any differently? Yes, I think so—if a man's
ideal of existence is to make a supreme animal of himself. If the
human way of playing the game did not bring monetary rewards,
and if a man's life consisted in eating and drinking and dressing
and housing himself, he would be justified in conducting his pro-
fessional life on other than a broadly human basis ; and I am afraid
that too much of the advice to us engineers makes these two con-
cessions ; but though I might be prepared in the face of convinc-
ing proof to grant the first, the second is as wrong as can be. Why
should a man slave, and break his heart, and narrow his life to
get a few extra dollars which can be translated into only the more
refined forms of bestiality, when with less heartaches and less ef-
fort he could content himself with the much more easily attain-
able and cruder forms?
As long as we engineers have human hearts in us, there is only
one real thing that we can do with the reward of our efforts,
and that is to use that reward as a vehicle for the fuller realiza-
tion of our manhood. We would not then be so asinine as to sac-
rifice or narrow our manhood for the attainment of wealth which
can satisfactorily be used only as it expresses the very manhood
that might be paid for it. The broadly human game, .thoroughly
played in even a modest, poorly paid position, brings a man great-
er happiness, more out of life than he could ever get from a nar-
row, technical, selfish game, though the latter might, in terms of
the market, succeed.
I fear that this paper may listen like a preachment, and I
should hate to have that stigma placed upon it, because far from
being an expression of a theory of our professional needs, it is the
summary of a pretty wide acquaintance covering the past ten
years; an expression—may I frankly say?—of some things, to
have known which when I first put college life behind me, I would,
in the light of present knowledge, have gladly given a great deal.


"AN AUTOMOBILE BUILT IN THE U. OF M. SHOPS BY
. TWO ENGINEERING STUDENTS."
A one hundred-inch wheelbase roadster has just been com-
pleted by Stanley R. and Clayton C. Thomas, '12 Engineers. Work
on the plans was started during the first part of their sophomore
year and from that time until late this last fall, a period extending
over two years, every bit of their spare time,—vacations, nights,
Saturdays, holidays, and even between classes,—was spent on the
designing and construction of what has proven in every way to
be a practical working automobile.
Very few of the parts were bought from manufacturing con-
cerns. The aluminum crank case and twin cylinders were obtained
in the rough from an automobile company. The axles were taken
from an old Loco-Surrey Steamer and the wheels from a Waverly
Electric. The radiator was cut down from a larger one into shape
small enough to meet conditions. This, in itself, was a full week's
job. The seat and tank are the only boughten parts of the body.
All other parts of the entire machine, and the patterns where nec-
essary, were made here in the Engineering Shops.
Plans were drawn for a 20 H.P. twin cylinder engine of the
"L" head type, four cycle, 4^2" bore by 5" stroke and with 27%
clearance. The pistons were made very light with three tight'
fitting rings each. This, with the low percentage of clearance in
the cylinders, gives a very high compression. In fact, it is just
below the limits of compression where pre-ignition troubles set in.
The crank shaft was built up of seven separate pieces machined
and driven together, each fit secured with two round keys.
The valves are of the large head poppet type. The cams
which lift the valves were made separately on the milling machine,
that is, non-integral with the cam shaft. After milling, the cams
were case-hardened and pinned in place on the cam shaft. The
cam shaft is offset from the center line of the push rods, which
arrangement gives quick closing valves. The push rods are of
case-hardened steel with roller cam contact, sliding in journal .


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
bronze sleeves. The timer, which is fitted with hardened steel ball
contacts, is strictly of "Thomas" origin.
Oiling is done by the splash system, with pockets provided on
the inside of the crank case for the purpose of catching and lead-
ing oil to the various journals. Besides this oiling, the rear jour-
nal is fitted with a large grease cup which is piped up through
the dash. The cooling system is of the thermo-syphon type (with-
out circulating pump) which works very well. The transmission
is friction drive, made up of a cast iron disc rolling against and
at right angles to a paper tired friction wheel. This disc was made
for a trial out of cast iron and will later be replaced by a disc of
aluminum bronze which will decrease slippage to a great extent.
As mentioned before, the seat and tank were the only parts of
the body not made in the shops. The frame was made up of 2"
angle iron riveted in shape. The steering wheel was fitted with
spark control and the throttle with foot accelerator. The many
levers, wrought iron and brass fittings, and braces were worked
out by hand.
The machine has been of great benefit, in more ways than one,
to the two young men who built it. They not only have the use
of a serviceable roadster,—and it is in constant use as such,—but
they have the satisfaction of knowing that it is the result of their
own handiwork. The building of it, to be sure, was more for the
experience to be gained than for any particular improvement on
the modern automobile, but nevertheless, the product is a thing
which may be looked upon with pride.
The Thomas Brothers, however, do not wish to take all the
credit for this achievement. They say that a great deal is due to
Professor Miggett and the several shop instructors and shop fore-
men, and they have authorized The Technic to express their sin-
cere appreciation to these gentlemen without whose kind assist-
ance and advice they claim the machine would not have been built.

PROF. MOYER'S BOOK ON POWER PLANT TESTING.
BY J. E. EMSW1LER.
Engineers who have occasion to do experimental work—and
most engineers do have more or less of such work to do—will be
glad to avail themselves of Professor Mover's book entitled "Pow-
er Plant Testing." The book is not a treatise on experimental
engineering in general. Its scope is confined to a simple descrip-
tion of the apparatus, including the theory, followed by the ex-
planation of accepted methods of testing, and computing results.
In Mechanical Engineering testing, the quantities to be ob-
served are so varied and complex, that a great number and va-
riety of instruments are necessary for their measurement. Some
of them are extremely complicated and delicate, and are composed
of many parts, requiring careful calibration, adjustment and at-
tention in their use. Professor Moyer has devoted the first seven
chapters—nearly half the book—to instruments used in testing.
To some, much of the descriptive matter contained in these first
seven chapters may seem superfluous; but to the student who is
using the instruments for the first time, or to the engineer who
has not had some of them in his hands since he left school; or to
the practical operator who is attempting to better the performance
of his plant, but has never had the opportunity to become familiar
with the use and construction of testing instruments, the descrip-
tive matter does not come amiss .The precautions mentioned at
frequent intervals, often in the form of foot notes, relative to the
use and misuse of instruments, are most valuable to the beginner
as a guide, and to the more experienced tester as a reminder of
unlooked for and oftentimes forgotten troubles that always arise
in experimental work.
Two chapters are given on methods of testing relative to fuels
and combustion, after which the subject of Boiler testing is taken
up. Here the author with a few remarks at the beginning and end
of the chapter, has simply inserted the rules for boiler testing as
laid down by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.
In the next few chapters, and in one following later on hy-
draulic machinery, the testing of prime movers—Steam Engines,
Steam Turbines, Gas Engines and Water Turbines—is described.
The chapters on testing of steam engines, and steam turbines
are especially good. The subject of valve setting is touched upon


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
and in that connection, the page of abnormal indicator diagrams,
is particularly instructive. The question as to how the total num-
ber of heat units, per pound of steam, supplied to the engine or
turbine should be determined is considered, and it is pointed out
that this quantity should be figured above the temperature of the
exhaust, rather than above the temperature of the feed water,
which is a factor that does not affect the economy. However,
Professor Mover explains, that a more logical method of express-
ing the efficiency of an engine or turbine, and one that is growing
in favor, is to base the efficiency upon the energy that would be-
come available from the steam if it expanded adiabatically from
the initial condition to the exhaust pressure; i. c, by considering
the Rankine or Clausius cycle as the cycle of the ideal engine. It
is shown how the available energy can be calculated.
A chapter on methods of correcting turbine and engine re-
sults is one which will be referred to frequently for enabling a
comparison to be made of tests run under small differences in con-
ditions. Ventilating systems, air compressors, refrigerating plants,
arid hot air engines are described, and methods of testing ex-
plained very briefly. Of the matter contained in this group, the
explanation of the method of calculating tests of fans or ventilat-
ing systems is perhaps the best.
Chapters on testing of belts and hoists, hydraulic machinery,
and strength of materials complete the book. The last of these—
testing the strength of materials—while it is very brief consider-
ing the scope of the subject treated, is nevertheless an excellent
condensed presentation of the matter for the ordinary mechanical
engineer.
In most cases, standard forms for data and results are given.
These serve as a guide to the tester in taking readings, and save
considerable time.
The book fulfills well the aim of the author, as expressed in
the preface, that it was primarily intended for students in labora-
tory courses, but it was hoped and expected that practical engi-
neers would find it useful to them as well. It is of convenient size
—about 400 pages—and is a pleasing piece of work as a product
of the publishers (McGraw Hill Book Co.) both on account of
its excellence of binding, cuts, etc., and because of its willingness
to stay open at any page.

EDITORIALS.
The Technic appears this year as a semi-annual. It was the
hope of the past boards to publish a quarterly, but it has been
rather conclusively proven that under present conditions such a
procedure is almost an impossibility. It would seem to the out-
sider that it would be a comparatively easy matter to get out two
more issues during the year, but we believe that those who have
formerly been connected with the management of The Technic
will unite with us in saying that the present system involves about
the limit of a student's time outside the class room. In fact, even
though the directing positions be made remunerative as has been


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
suggested, or if a certain number of hours credit were given, it
is a natural conclusion that increasing the number of issues would
decrease somewhat the amount of material available per issue, and
thereby reduce the size and no doubt lower the standard of the
publication. This, however, should not be taken to mean that
we consider that there are not enough Michigan men in the engi-
neering profession to furnish copy for the larger number of issues.
On the contrary, if all of Michigan's graduate engineers were to
send for publication only their most valuable data and only the
most interesting of the results of their investigations in their var-
ied practice, the massing together of such a wealth of willing con-
tributions would take by far a larger volume than the modest
booklet now known as The Michigan Technic. We mean by
"available material" all that The Technic board has the oppor-
tunity to collect and get in shape during its few short working
hours. The collecting of this material, as well as the business de-
tails and the actual overseeing of the printing, takes considerable
time and the summation of this time over two issues has been
found to be a maximum. Last year's staff had a hurculean task
on their hands in getting out three issues in the face of seemingly
insurmountable difficulties which we who were but slightly af-
fected by them can scarcely appreciate, and we cannot commend
them too highly on the excellent work they did and the way they
succeeded in pulling out of a really desperate situation. It is the
firm conviction of the present board that the semi-annual is the
best all around for The Technic and it is to be hoped that future
boards will look well about them before taking steps to increase
the number of issues.
It will perhaps be well here to note the fact of a rather curious
circumstance with regard to the articles on the subject of electric
railway transportation problems by Mr. George A. Damon and
Mr. J. R. Bibbins. Although treating different phases of the same
subject, the two articles were written entirely independently of
one another. Both articles came in answer to The Technic's re-
quest for material along this line and both were found in the same
mail, the one by Mr. Damon from Los Angeles and the other from


115
Chicago. Mr. Damon and Mr. Bibbins are connected with the
Arnold Company of Chicago and are working along similar lines
of investigation though having charge of work in different locali-
ties. Mr. Damon had direct charge of the Arnold investigation
and report in Los Angeles and the succeeding work of appraising
electrical and traction properties, while Mr. Bibbins was in charge
of the Providence work. Both worked on the Pittsburgh project.
A more extensive treatise of this most interesting subject than
is possible in the few pages here devoted to it may be found in
the various reports of Bion J. Arnold from investigations carried
on in many cities of the country. Other Michigan men, too, are
strong advocates of the graphical method of analyzing problems
of various kinds and perhaps they may be prevailed upon to use
the columns of The Technic to make a permanent and valuable
record of the contents of their note books.
The debating work of the Engineering Society carried on un-
der the direction of Chairman Ira T. Hook is proving to be even
more popular this year than last. The subjects are of a most in-
teresting nature and give rise to discussions of the greatest value
to those participating in the debates. This branch of the Society's
work is certainly one which goes a long way toward satisfying a
great need of every engineer. It tends not only to broaden, but
to give to the man who takes part the confidence to stand up be-
fore a number of men and speak and make himself understood.
We are grateful indeed to the man whose suggestion gave impe-
tus to the movement last year. Future officers of the Society
should make it their duty to get behind and boost the system to
perfection.
The Technic at last boasts of a ''sanctum." Through the
efforts of Dean Cooley, a room in the Old Engineering Building
was set aside for the purpose of providing a place for the more
efficient and more convenient directing of the affairs of our publi-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
cation, both editorially and financially. In addition to this, access
is handy to a capacious vault where old records and files may be
kept undisturbed. Since being fitted throughout with new furni-
ture the little room makes a right serviceable office, pleasing to the
eye, and gives to The Technic a truly business like aspect. It
certainly will afford a better chance than has ever before been
presented to inaugurate a more definite system for the handling
of the different branches of the work, and it is the ambition of the
present board to be able to work out such a system whereby much
of the uncertainty and confusion incident to the changing of man-
agement from year to year will be wiped out. There will be no
conflicting with other interests. Everything pertaining to The
Technic will be handy to its managers, and The Technic will
be efficient to the extent that they wish to make it. We look to
future boards to continue to improve, not only the surroundings,
but the internal workings of our "sanctum sanctorum" and we
take great pride in handing it down to them as a sort of heirloom
which will be kept in The Technic family as long as there is a
Technic and as long as there is a MICHIGAN.

The Wickes Vertical Water-Tube Boiler
THE BOILER OF SCIENCE
No idle money required to be tied up in boil-
ers standing idle any length of time for clean-
ing. Therefore, the unit cost of power due to
investmeni and maintenance is held to a mini-
mum.
The tubes are straight, every tube can be
looked through, washed or scraped. The cut
shows a man standing erect using turbine
cleaner. Is it laborious compared with other
forms? Two men can open, scrape and close
this boiler in ten hours.
High furnace temperature results from Dutch
oven, gases closely scrub heating surface. No
chance for short-circuiting; no chance for
gases to enter pockets unfilled with heating
surface; very long gas travel provided.

This illustration shows a scene in the Testing Department
of the General Electric Company. A group of technical grad-
uates are testing two large frequency changer seta by the
pumping back method. Each set consists of a 1250 Kw. alter-
nator driven by a synchronous motor with direct connected
exciter. Si-V teen men are required to take the readings in
this test.
400 to 500 technically trained men are employed as Student
Engineers in the Testing Department of the General Electric
Company. These men test all the apparatus manufactured at
the Schenectady and Pittsfield Works, including steam tur-
bines, and are transferred from one section to another at regu-
lar intervals.
The work is not easy and not always ple»sant, but it offers
an excellent opportunity for the engineering student to secure
a practical knowledge of the latest types of all kinds of elec-
trical machinery.
Applications for employment in the Testing Department
should be sent to Mr. A. L. Rohrer, Electrical Superintendent.

much to be preferred. Among these are the charging of storage
batteries and the operation of arc lamps. In order, then, to draw
power from the established distributing systems for the above
purposes, it is necessary to use some device that will take power
in the alternating current form and deliver it in that form de-
sired. While this can always be accomplished by the use of such
rotating machinery as the motor generator or the rotary converter,
yet there is a fundamental advantage in accomplishing the result
by a simple switching of the current into the direct channels with-
out disturbing the continuity of flow.

A device which has come into general use for this purpose is
the mercury rectifier. This consists of a vacuum chamber, in gen-
eral, similar to Fig. i, with two anodes which are commonly of
graphite or iron, and a cathode which, in the practical rectifier,
must be mercury although some other metal of low boiling point
would operate. There is usually an auxiliary anode of mercury
used only for producing an initial starting arc. The common

matter of fact current, in any appreciable quantity, cannot flow
in Any direction whatever until by some special means a spark or
small arc has been produced at the surface of the mercury in such
a direction that the cathode mercury pool is at the negative end
of the arc. The reason for this will be discussed later under the
theory of operation.
The current resulting from a single phase rectifier is not
smooth but is undulating or possesses a ripple. Fig. 4 shows this.
This ripple is the result of the combining of the two half waves,
with a partial bridging-over, of the low point between them. This
bridging-over is obtained by the use of a reactance as indicated in
Fig. 3 and Fig. 5, which absorbs energy during the rise of the
wave and gives it out while the wave is falling in value. This
external reactance can be omitted and the same result obtained by
means of leakage between the two halves of the transformers in
the supply circuit. The mechanical arrangement of the coils to
accomplish this is shown in Figs. 6 and 7. Fig. 6 is typical of the
connections for battery charging, and Figs. 5 and 7 show the

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
While commonly used only on single phase circuits, it is en-
tirely possible to build a rectifier with three anodes to take its
supply from a three-phase circuit and deliver direct current. In
this case, the undulation or ripple in the direct current will be
much reduced, inasmuch as there will be six half wave peaks in-
stead of two in the period of one complete wave.

Arc Light Regulator.
As the drop through the rectifier bulb or tube is approximately
fixed and ranges from 14 volts for a battery charging or low volt-
age bulb to 25 volts for an arc light or high voltage bulb, the re-
sulting efficiency depends largely on the voltage of the direct cur-
rent circuit to which power is delivered. It is obvious that on a
14 volt direct current circuit with 14 volts drop in the bulb the
efficiency cannot be above 50%. On the other hand, when deliv-
ering 110 volts direct current, the efficiency may be 80% or over,
and on arc light outfits delivering, say, 3,500 volts, the bulb drops
has no appreciable effect and the efficiency of the regulating trans-
former is the determining factor. This may reach 90 to 92%.
There seems to be no fundamental reason why the mercury rec-
tifier cannot be built for any desired capacity. The technical diffi-
culties, however, of producing and maintaining vacuum appara-
tus of large size in such perfect condition as to be reasonably free

from trouble are very great. While this is true, there is no other
device that can accomplish the same result with the same simplic-
ity and cheapness, and for that reason the technical difficulties will

doubtless be overcome and the mercury rectifier will find general
application for all purposes in changing from alternating to direct
current.
The Theory of the Mercury Rectifier.
To get an approximate understanding of the mercury vapor
rectifier, it will be necessary to consider the peculiar characteristics
of vapor conduction of electricity.


CHE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
There is pretty good evidence of the existence of so-called
"ions" or small electrically charged particles existing almost uni-
versally in gases. The positive ions are apparently atoms or mole-
cules of the gas having a certain unit positive charge. Just what
the nature of this positive charge is, may not be absolutely cer-
tain, but for our purposes this is not important. The negative
ions, on the other hand, appear to be exceedingly small particles
commonly called "electrons'' or "corpuscles" having a similar unit
negative charge and an apparent mass of about 1/1700 that of a
hydrogen atom. This mass appears to be due to the negative elec-
tric charge and the lines of force set up by it and not to have any
material existence at all.
Now, ions, particularly negative ions, seem to be almost uni-
versally present in the atmosphere. Under high electric stress
their number may increase indefinitely as a result of their rapid
movement and collision with molecules of gas and with electrified
terminals or electrodes. If a potential is applied hetween two par-
allel plates in the open air, there is a slight flow of current, even
though the applied voltage may be very low. This current, how-
ever, is not proportional to the voltage but appears to increase
somewhat, as the potential difference increases, and reach a max-
imum where increase of potential, without other change, brings
no further increase of current. Apparently, the ions that float into
the electric field are driven by it in such a way that there is an
effective handing of charges across from the negative plate to the
atmosphere and from the atmosphere to the positive plate. An in-
crease of electric force increases the velocity of these ions but
there can be no further increase of conduction beyond using all
the ions that naturally float into the electric field. This is a form
of conduction in a gas in which there is no additional production
of ions by the electric field. If the potential gradient between the
electrodes increases, a point may be reached where the electric
field begins to cause increased ionization of the gas due to the im-
pact of the moving ions upon free molecules and the electrodes.
This increases the conduction but may still give a stable condition.
The corona between high voltage transmission conductors is an
example. Where ionization of the gas is taking place, there is us-
ually an accompanying glow or faint light. If conduction of this
type is pushed still harder, the result is the formation of an arc


9
which, in itself, is unstable and tends to increase, unless controlled
by otber parts of the circuit. The reason for this is that, while
with the two previous forms of conduction, an increase of cur-
rent necessitated an increase of potential difference an arc, in
general, develops less potential drop with an increase of current.
Now, if the gas pressure is reduced, all of the above character-
istics become, in a way, accentuated and take place at much lower
voltages as the pressure becomes lower, until a certain critical
pressure is reached where, at the approach of complete vacuum,
the rarified gas tends to become more nearly an insulator.

Fig. io. Graphic Indication or Light and Dark Bands and Potential
Drop in a Vacuum Tube.
As described by Professor J. J. Thompson in '"Electric Con-
ductivity of Gases" the action of a vacuum tube during the glow
discharge (corresponding to the corona in the atmosphere) is
somewhat as follows: At the negative terminal or cathode, there
may be a slight luminescence and then a band of dark space
called the "Crooks dark space." There is a large drop of poten-
tial through this space called the "cathode fall of potential." At
the border of this dark space is a luminous band known as the
"cathode glow" and having very little potential drop. After this
comes another dark band known as the "Farady dark space" with
a low potential drop gradually merging into the "positive column"

erate potential drop which reaches to the anode with perhaps a
slight increase of potential drop near the anode. Fig. 10 shows
the distribution of potential and the light and dark bands graph-
ically.
The explanation given is that up to a certain voltage between
terminals, there is no continued conductivity as the number of
free ions is limited and the negative ions are soon all driven to
the positive terminal and vice versa but without the formation
of any new ions since the velocity of the moving ions is not great
enough to supply the required energy. As the potential difference
increases, a point is finally reached when the impact of the positive
ions on the cathode or on the molecules of gas, very close to the
cathode, cause the release of electrons or negative ions which are
repelled with great velocity through the dark space, and at a cer-
tain point begin actively striking molecules of gas and forming
new positive and negative ions which migrate in their respective
directions to the cathode and anode. This is a continuous process
so long as the potential difference is maintained. The glow or
luminescent spaces appear to be the localities where ionization of
the gas is taking place and where positive and negative ions are
about equally distributed. The key to the conduction of the cur-
rent is apparently the breaking off of electrons from the cathode
and their expulsion violently from it as negative charges.
This breaking off of electrons from the cathode is called "ion-
ization at the cathode" and apparently takes place when a certain
critical amount of energy per unit surface is released by the im-
pact of the positive ions on the cathode. If the pressure, at which
the above described characteristics begin to be visible, is still fur-
ther reduced, the Crocks dark space expands and the cathode drop
increases. It would appear that the pressure being lower and the
positive ions fewer it is necessary that more energy per ion be
imparted by the electric field to maintain cathode ionization and,
therefore, conduction. Consequently, the cathode drop increases
and covers a greater distance, and the positive ions, accelerated
through a longer path, accumulate enough more energy to main-
tain the process of ionization.
W hile the cathode drop and the length of the Crooks dark
space may not be directly connected, yet they seem to be both a
function of pressure. The dark space is probably controlled by


I I
the mean free path of the negative electrons in the gas and the
length is roughly equal to / = a -j- c/p where ,a and c are con-
stants and p is pressure of the gas. Similarly the cathode drop
apparently follows the approximate law of V = K-\-b/p where
A" and b are constants.
For a considerable range of pressure, the cathode drop is in the
region of 400 to 500 volts. As may seem, however, if p becomes
very small, the value of V may become very large and take an in-
finite value when p = o. From this, it would appear that the only
absolute insulating medium is a perfect vacuum.
Experiments indicate that wben. the pressure is reduced, the
Crooks dark space expands to touch the walls of the containing
tube and spreads far towards the anodes. The current then falls
rapidly and the cathode drop increases to very large values. Now
this is the condition existing at the momentarilv inactive anode
of a rectifier which is at that instant really a cathode of a vacuum
tube of very high vacuum and large cathode drop. The Crooks
dark space has, in general, expanded to fill the entire tube or
bulb. There is usually a slight leakage current between the posi-
tives or anodes especially when the bulb is warm and the mercury
vajwr pressure thereby increased but with the bulb cold and the
dark space expanded as above the vapor really becomes almost
a perfect insulator.
Now, what is occurring between the active anode of the rec-
tifier and the mercury pool when the normal load current is pass-
ing? To all appearances there is here a true arc as all its charac-
teristics seem to be identical with that of metallic arc.
An arc, like combustion in the atmosphere, is self maintaining.
That is. having once been started by any cause, there appears a
focus of negative ionization where there is sufficient energy re-
leased to maintain continued ionization unless the current reaches
too low a value when the bombardment of the positive ions on
the negative spot no longer produces a sufficient supply of negative
ions or electrons and the arc ceases. It will then have to be re-
started by some special means.
The general characteristics of the mercury arc in the vacuum
chamber are. in every way. identical with that of any metallic arc
in the open air. The following are examples: (1) The circuit is un-
stable unless controlled by resistance or reactance in other por-


tions of the circuit. (2) The drop is approximately constant but
tends to lower in value with increase of current. (3) A supple-
mentary electrode will pass current to the cathode if connected
in any way to the anode or positive side of the circuit, but will not
pass any current if connected to the cathode or the negative side
of the circuit. If, however, it is connected to the negative through
a separate source of e.m.f. current will flow from this supple-
mentary electrode to the cathode but not from the cathode. In
other words, an ordinary arc possesses rectifying characteristics.
The mercury vapor rectifier, moreover, appears to be nothing more
mysterious than a vacuum tube in which the vapor pressure is
very low and in which an arc plays successively from one of two
or more anodes to a mercury cathode and in which the idle anode
becomes a cathode of the vacuum tube with the usually high cath-
ode vapor drop and Crooks dark space much accentuated due to
the low pressure of the mercury vapor and the absence of all con-
taminating gases.
Fundamentally, the rectifying characteristic is due to the
marked difference between positive and negative ions in regard
to mass and consequent velocity and energy storing capacity. At
this point, however, we reach about the limit of our knowledge
of the constitution of matter and its relation to electric conduc-
tion. Just why an arc should continue when once a certain rate
of ionization at the cathode surface has once been started when
it would not start itself, is a mystery of the same class as that of
a fire which will burn when once the fuel has been ignited. There
is apparently a critical rate of ionization at the cathode surface.
During the glow discharge, the rate is below this critical value.
A slight reduction in rate of ionization and consequent current
flow necessitates a broader Crooks dark space and a greater cath-
ode drop, and the other parts of the tube give up some of their
drop to the cathode space to maintain ionization with the reduced
current. The conduction is, therefore, stable as the essential por-
tion of the circuit where the cathode drop is located is balanced
by drop of a resistance nature in the other portion of the tube
nearer to the anode. There are barely enough ions produced to
carry the current and an increase of voltage increases the number
of ions produced per second and therefore the current. At the
critical rate, however, where the arc appears, more ions than need-


13
ed are produced and the current would automatically rise to short
circuit value unless limited by external portions of the circuit con-
taining impedance.
The writer, however, realizes that this explanation only pushes
the matter a little further back into the region of the unknown
where we must stop for lack of experimental information.


HYDRAULIC POWER DEVELOPMENTS
AT MASSENA, X. Y.
Lylk A. Whitsit, '05.
(Editor's Note:—Rather than give a detailed description of the
development at Massenn, Mr. Whitsit has outlined some of the ice
troubles experienced in that vicinity and some of the weaker points in the
original design and has shown how these have 'been improved in the
annex recently built.)
The hydroelectric power possibilities at or near Massena, X.
V., which make use of the water in the St. Lawrence River,
consist of the future or proposed development located on the St.
Lawrence River proper, near Long Sault and Barnhart Islands;
and the present development located two and three quarter miles
inland on the north hank of the Grasse River. Figure 1 is a
map of the country in this vicinity and shows the locations of
these developments.
The conditions here are very favorable for a power devel-
opment during the greater part of the year. The supply of water
has its source in the Great Lakes and the drainage basin tributary
to the Lakes. The drainage area of the basin is 287.000 square
miles. There is, therefore, a large amount of water available.
The Great Lakes form enormous storage reservoirs, which give
a very marked uniform flow at this point. The maximum dis-
charge is 355.000 second feet and the minimum discharge is
152,000 second feet. The range of the river from minimum to
maximum, namely, 203,000 second feet is only 133 per cent of the
minimum. For the average river this value is many times this
percent. The period of high seasonal flow follows a year later
than the season of high rainfall on its western drainage area. It
is therefore possible to foretell the available water supply in a
general way. Notwithstanding these advantages there is one dis-
advantage, namely, the ice troubles which accompany the severe
winters and which are common to all these northern water pow-
ers.


15
Ice Conditions:
In the case of most power plants, the low power periods are
coincident with the periods of low water during the summer
months, but on the northern rivers and especially those on the
St. Lawrence, the developments suffer most from ice troubles.
A great deal of time and money has been spent towards the so-
lution of this problem. The ice conditions reach a greater mag-
nitude at this point than anywhere else in the country. The
winters are long and very severe. The months of January and
February are the coldest months, with extreme temperatures
ranging from 10 to 20" below zero and occasionally to 25° and
30° below. The temperatures of zero or below have been record-
ed from November to March inclusive. The long steady cold
weather conducive to extreme ice conditions is often experienced.
Lake Ontario presents a large radiating surface, and the water
here becomes cold before passing into the head of the St. Law-
rence river. For forty miles of open river, the water passes
through swift currents and eddies and over numerous rapids,
which prevent the formation of an ice .cover, but which agitate
the water completely from top to bottom and expose every parti-
cle to the cold atmosphere. The water on its arrival.at this lo-
cation is chilled down to the point of "frazil" and anchor ice
formation. Worse conditions than these could hardly be imag-
ined.
There are four kinds of ice to be contended with:
(1 ) "Border Ice," which consists of thick cakes of ice broken
off from the edges of the marginal ice along the open river
stretches above the canal;
(2) "Anchor Ice," which forms on the river bottoms in the
rapids on cold nights, and which in the morning is detached by
the warmth of the sun, rises and floats down stream. It forms in
slushy masses and clogs openings in the racks and turbines.
(3) "Frazil," which consists of millions of small ice crystals.
They form in a mass of moving water, when the latter is open
and is exposed to the heat radiation of the clear cold winter
weather. The temperature of the water is at the freezing point,
and is prevented by the swift current from congealing. It is rare-
ly formed when the sunlight strikes the water, and the sunlight
also exerts an influence in breaking it up. The "frazil" congeals


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
rapidly whenever the water becomes at all quiet or when it comes
in contact with cold iron and steel surfaces. It also attaches it-
self to the underside of surface ice and forms the so called
"hanging dam," which builds down into the water and cuts off
the water flow entirely. The "frazil" is the worst of four kinds
of ice and is the greatest foe of all northern water powers.
(4) "Snow slush," which forms during a heavy snow storm.
The large snow flakes fall onto the water whose temperature is
not high enough to melt the snow. It gathers in large slushy
masses on the surface and in the body of the water.
During the early history of the plant the ice troubles required
the complete shutting down of the power house periodically, and
even when it was in operation, it was at a very reduced capacity.
At that time the canal section was small, for as soon as it was
able to carry water the plant was put into operation. The en-
larging of the canal to the finished size was carried on during the
summer seasons by hydraulic dredging. The currents at the in-
take were swift and during the winter season the border ice and
frazil were drawn into the canal in large quantities. The already
small canal section soon became choked up with ice and the water
supply was. practically shut off.
The primary cause of the diversions of ice into the canal
were ice jams, which invariably form in the South Sault during
the winter season. A body of floating ice accumulates in the
upper courses of the river, floats into the South Channel and
lodges at a narrow part of the river near "Tracey's" (see Figure
1.). The course of the river at this point and the narrow chan-
nel are favorable to this formation, which is locally known as an
"ice bridge," as it affords the islanders a ready means of reaching
the mainland and of conveying their produce to market during
the long winter. They would otherwise have to ferry by boat
through a swift and dangerous current. After the formation of
the bridge at Tracey's the jam quickly builds upstream and
when its upper end reaches the canal intake, all of the border ice,
anchor ice, and frazil in the stream is diverted into the canal.
This all happens in an amazingly short time. The section of the
canal is soon filled with ice and the water supply completely shut
off. The jam then continues upstream to Dodge's Shoals. As
the name indicates this is a low submerged reef which extends




THE MICHICAN TECHNIC
from the mainland and across the channel to Delaney's Island.
The water is shallow over the reef. The jam builds over the
Shoals and during the following extreme low temperatures the
frazil and anchor ice in the water builds a hanging dam on the un-
derside of the jam. Another effective barrier to the passage of
water is thus constructed.
These ice conditions have been greatly bettered, but as yet
not entirely overcome. If the South Sault channel can be kept
open and free from ice jams at Tracey's, a swift heavy current
is maintained through on this side of the island and carries most
of the ice entering this channel safely past the entrance of the
canal. A force of men is stationed night and day at the danger
point at Tracey's and any pretending jam is helped on its way.
The bays are allowed to freeze over and with an ice cover on
each side, an open channel is maintained in the middle of the
stream only slightly wider than the river section immediately up-
stream from this location. The parts of the channel upstream
and downstream from this point are self maintaining. To aid the
above condition a heavy boom is erected across the entrance of
the canal. The river side of the boom projects down well into
the water and presents a smooth surface for deflecting the ice
cakes down stream. The wide front of the boom prevents the ice
from diving under the boom and from following the canal cur-
rent.
Ice tugs were also procured to keep the surface ice from form-
ing on the canal. They traversed the area several times a day and
kept it open. The ice floated down the canal and was discharged
into the Grasse River over an ice weir especially constructed for
this purpose. Another boom was located immediately upstream
from the power house to deflect the ice into the ice shoot.
With the canal kept open, it was expected to maintain a high-
er power output over what would otherwise be possible. An ice
covered canal has not only less water carrying capacity, but is also
less efficient than an open canal. In addition to the area of water
section being cut down by the ice cover, the frictional resistance
to water flow from the wetted perimeter are increased. It is in-
credible the amount a thick layer of ice cuts down the capacity
and efficiency. The solid ice forms on the canal to a thickness of
30" to 36". In addition to this the anchor ice and frazil, which


I 9
arc drawn into the canal, form on the under surface until the net
cross section of the usually open canal is greatly reduced. This
amounts to about 40% in a 10 foot canal, and about 30% in a 15
foot canal. ,
Not only is the ice covered canal of less capacity and efficien-
cy, but when once the condition obtains, the clogging of the canal
rapidly increases in amount. For, the natural thing for the sta-
tion operator to do, when he finds the canal failing to furnish the
water, is to increase the water slope in the canal in order to in-
crease the velocity. This procedure draws in ice and frazil at an
increased rate, which in turn further cuts down the water section.
It would be a better policy not to let this condition get the upper
hand. It is necessary to attack the problem early at the beginning
of the season, in order to maintain a slope as small as possible and
the water surface as high as possible throughout the length of
the canal. These precautions will give the greatest water area
under the ice and the lowest mean velocity. This operation has
been tried out and found to be successful.
The above argument for an open canal is well founded from
the view point of canal operation, but it causes serious trouble at
the power house. The open water of the canal affords addition-
al opportunity for the formation of frazil and anchor ice which
is not carried off by the ice weir, but which, being distributed
throughout the mass of moving water, has to pass through the
turbines. The results were the frequent and lasting shut downs
with entire cutting off of power. As some power, even though it
be small in amount, is better than none, the method of open canal
had to be abandoned and the policy now is to allow the canal to
freeze over at the very first of the season.
Unless the turbine equipment and turbine chamber are es-
pecially designed to meet and take care of frazil conditions, the
ice covered canal is to be preferred. The ice cover acts as a
blanket on the water. It retains what heat there is in the water
and prevents further radiation. The formation of frazil is not
only arrested, but it is prevented and the temperature of the wat-
er is raised above the frazil point, provided there is not too great
an amount being drawn in. If the temperature can be raised only
a fraction of a degree above freezing point, it prevents frazil.
This the ice cover seems to accomplish. Nevertheless, the precau-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
tion has to be taken, that the clogging operation of the canal does
not get the upper hand. As the canal section is enlarged and nears
its completed designed size, the ice troubles of the winter will
decrease, for the reason that the deeper canal is more efficient.
Future Development:
By referring again to Figure r, it will be noted that the St.
Lawrence River is divided into two channels by Long Sault Isl-
and and also again at a short distance downstream by Barnhart
Island. About 19% of the normal flow of the river passes thru
channel "A", and 81% thru channel "B";—about 3% thru chan-
nel "C", and 97% thru "D". There is a thirty foot head avail-
able at point "E" and a thirty-five foot head available at point
"G". It is proposed to construct a dam from the mainland to the
foot of Long Sault Island at "E", a second dam from the foot of
Long Sault to the head of liarnhart Island, and a third one from
the foot of Barnhart Island to the Canadian shore. The power
houses will be located in the first and third dams and the middle
dam will be a spillway section.
The natural conditions afforded by this arrangement are very
favorable for a satisfactory sequence of the construction work.
The three separate channels of the river will allow work to be
conducted in one channel, while the other channels are taking
care of the water. The two sections containing the power houses
can be built first and a portion of the power can be developed
during the time the third or spillway section is being built. It
will therefore "be possible to realize on the investment before
the total development is completed. The description of the pro-
posed development is purposely not carried into any further de-
tail, because the present ideas and intentions may never be incor-
porated in a final design. There is such a continual improvement
going on in turbine and power house design, that any present de-
signs will likely be changed. The recent development of the
single runner type of turbine of high specific speed I believe bids
fair to change power house construction materially, especially in
the case of low head developments.
Present Development:
The present development consists of a power canal, which
takes water from the St. Lawrence River near the head of Long


2 I
Sault Island. It is three miles long and delivers the water in-
land to a power house on the bank of the Grasse River. At
this point there is available during open channel conditions an
average head of about thirty feet.
The canal construction was very expensive. It contains two
deep cuts, in which the overburden was a large amount, and the
balance of the canal is in what would be considered a heavy cut.
There are no embankments except a short piece at the down-
stream and near the power house. The excessive cost of the canal
construction has made the investment cost high.
The power house is located across the end of the canal. The
tail race discharges directly into the Grasse River in a direction
at right angles to the current of the river. There is consequently
a small loss of head here due to the interference of water currents
and in the changing of the direction of the tail race to that of the
river.
The third part of the development consists of the natural bed
of the Grasse River, which forms the tail race for the plant to
deliver the water back again into the St. Lawrence river. It is
eight miles long from the power house to the mouth. There is an
excessive drop of eight feet in this distance when the power house
is using 10,000 second feet. The Grasse River bed, which dur-
ing its own history has been required to deliver an average flow
of 500 second feet with an occasional flow of 3,000 second feet,
is not adapted to take care of such a large discharge.
One would not have to stretch his imagination far to realize
that the money put into this investment would have been better
spent in a development in the South Sault channel of the St. Law-
rence river, for neither the canal nor the Grasse River are eco-
nomical in first cost or maintenance as channels for conveying
such large amounts of water. The small section of an artificial
canal or the bed of a small river are not to be compared for this
purpose with the South Sault channel, which with the water at
its present elevation has been scoured out by nature to a large
cross section. But in addition, with a dam at the foot of the
South Sault channel, and with the water surface raised thereby,
the river section and the water carrying capacity will be greatly
increased. Again with this increased section, causing lower ve-
locities and especially with the greater depth, the ice troubles


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
■would not have assumed the proportion that they do in the pres-
ent development. With the artificial canal and Grasse River for
a tail race, the amount of available power is a fixed amount,
which is much lower than that obtainable on the big river. The
economical limit of the canal and tail race is soon reached, for
as the amount of water is increased the various losses of head,
as loss at canal entrance, drop in the canal surface and Grasse
River, increase at a fast rate. The development, therefore, in the
South Sault channel would have cost much less per horse power.
The general arrangement of the original or present power
house is shown in Figure 2, by the cross section on the center line
of one of the units. The turbine is placed in a large flume cham-
ber and consists of six 5 foot runners on one horizontal shaft.
There are three draft chests and three draft tubes. The adjacent
runners discharge against one another into one common draft
tube. At the down stream end the main shaft extends through a
cast iron bulkhead cover to a connection with the generator unit.
Each generator unit contains two D. C. machines connected
in tandem. This arrangement required that the generator floor
be below the level of the flume floor and only a short distance
above the tail race water level. There were seven units of full
size, and three exciter units. Two of the large units have a single
A. C. machine. As there is always D. C. current on the bus bars,


2 3
the exciters were not required and have since been changed over
into one full size unit.
The horizontal combination with so many runners on one shaft
and two generators connected in tandem, make a very long unit.
The draft tubes discharge into a plain square tail race chamber,
which contains angular corners and dividing pier walls.
A few of the faulty features of the original power house
arrangement will be mentioned. From a mechanical point of
view, the turbine generator unit is too long. The total length
from the upstream end of the turbine to the downstream end of
the generator is 114 feet. .Most of the break downs and other
troubles are due primarily to this one feature in the design. The
gate shaft is so long that it suffers a permanent distortion. Again
though the main shaft is of a heavy section, yet it deflects be-
tween bearings and the couplings do not of their own accord
come together in a perfect contact. The shaft is so long that it
is difficult to erect and maintain in a correct alignment.
The gate operating mechanism consists of a worm and gear
transmission. This scheme has not proved to be satisfactory, for
in every case there has been severe cutting between the two parts.
A better transmission would be by means of a hydraulic cylinder,
hydraulic pressure, connecting rod and crank arm. The worm and
gear combination possesses the very desirable feature of non-re-
versibility, but the same may be obtained by the latter.
From a hydraulic point of view, the discharging of two run-
ners against one another and into one draft tube is not desirable.
There is an interference of the two streams of water, which caus-
es a loss of head. The draft chest should have a full rounded
section at the point "A" in Figure 2. There should be ample
room between the discharge ends of the runners and the draft
chest cover in the quarter turns. It will be seen also that the
draft tubes discharge at an angle with the floor of the tail race
chamber, and also against the streams of the other draft tubes.
There is a resulting cross surging of currents and some loss of
head. Due to the angular shape of the tail race chamber, the water
is not discharged economically. The fundamental principle in a
design of a power house structure should be that all water pas-
sages should change gradually from the point of entrance at the
forebay to that point where the water is- discharged at a low ve-
locity into the tail race.


THI MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Besides the losses enumerated above, there are also other un-
necessary losses in the plant such as eddies in front of the piers
in the forebay and at the ends of the tail race piers. These should
have round corners. The original head gates were of the wooden
miter-gate type, which caused a large loss at entrance to the flume
chambers. These have been replaced by steel gates of the Stoney
type. They are entirely removed during operation and only two
sets are required for the eight units.
The main structural defect is the low elevation of the gener-
ator floor. It is below the annual back water in the Grasse River.
The back water is caused by ice jams in the St. Lawrence below
the mouth of the Grasse River. For this reason the windows
were located high in order to be above the level of the backwater.
Consequently, the light conditions around the generators and the
ventilation of the generators and D. C. bus bars are not good.
The side walls had to be built to withstand the hydraulic pressure
from the occasional backwater and an emergency pump has to
be maintained. With all these precautions, there is always the
possibility of accident and of flooding the power house.
As originally planned only one half of the power house was
built and it was intended later to duplicate the present arrange-
ment. But when the time came to build the annex, these plans
were materially changed and a design made along modern lines
was adopted. The faults above enumerated were eliminated and
other improvements incorporated. A section on the center line
of one of the units is shown in Figure 3.
The essential feature of this design is, from a hydraulic point
of view, the use of a vertical type of turbine, by which the gen-
erator is raised above the highest possible back water in the
Grasse River. There is plenty of light and air in and about the
generators. Each unit contains only two runners. The shaft is
comparatively short and this together with its vertical position
make it easier to align. The runners are much larger, thereby
making the total required number of runners and of draft tubes
less. The water passages through the runners are larger, with a
resulting less loss due to friction against the wetted perimeters.
The increased size of runner has not caused an increase in the
spacing of units as this was determined by and limited by the
size of the D. C. generators. Both of the runners discharge down-


25
wards, thus making a minimum change in the direction of flow
from forebay to tail race. The runners discharge into seperate
draft tubes, thus preventing the interference of currents and re-
sulting loss of head.
Stoney type head gates are provided for. Two sets will serve
five units, as they are entirely removed during operation. The
flume entrance is therefore free and unobstructed. The gates
are equipped with roller nests. If the turbine gates become jam-
med and it is impossible to close them and stop the flow of water,
it is possible to place the Stoney head gates by means of the roller
nests. There have been several occasions when these were re-
quired and the scheme has worked very satisfactorily.
It is to be noted that the head gates are upstream from the
racks. By placing the head gates and unwatering the turbine
flume it is possible to repair, clean, or remove the racks easily.
It is a very essential feature to be able to clean them thoroughly
and quickly, especially in the latter parts of the summer.
An ideal arrangement is provided for ventilating of the gener-
ators and bus bars. The external wall on the thrust deck, the
floor just below the generator floor,, is nearly all windows. Over


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
this floor suspended from the floor beams above and between the
line of turbine units and the windows pass the U. C. bus bars.
The air will be drawn from the open windows by the spider of
the generator armature, acting as a fan, and expelled up through
the generator and into the generator room and then out of the
ventilators at the top. This current of air in going from the win-
dow to the generators passes in and around the bus bars.
A very useful feature of the annex is its office as an experi-
mental power house, to determine the best make of turbines and
improvements in design, to be incorporated in the future devel-
opment.

A .HEATING, VENTILATING AND COOLING SYSTEM
FOR A MODERN MACHINE SHOP.. .
W. II. Chapman. B.S., M.E.. '01.
The properly designed factory of today contains more provis-
ions in its construction for the health and comfort of employees
than ever before. The wise manufacturer, of the present time,
considers that an investment to provide for a satisfac-
tory working temperature, at all times, sufficient fresh
air and proper circulation of same will bring ample re-
turns in the increased quantity and better quality of
work turned out. The equipment, just being completed
in the Ford Motor Company's machine shops in Highland Park,
a suburb of Detroit, is an example of a modern heating, ven-
tilating and cooling equipment for large machine shops, designed
to maintain the conditions above mentioned.
The shops are of one story with saw-tooth roof construction.
The old shop is eight hundred (800') feet by one hundred seven-
ty-six (176') feet wide and the new shop is six hundred eighty
(680') feet long by three hundred thirty-five (335') feet wide.
The two shops are separated by an inclosed craneway. which is
used for storage purposes. The old shop is bounded on the west
and south sides by a four-story assembling building and the new
shop is bounded on the east and south sides by a continuation of
the same building. The shops have concrete and glass roofs
supported on steel trusses. The floors are practically all of wood
laid on a preservative and insulating bed of tar compound, con-
crete and cinders and were not considered, in calculating the heat
losses. The concrete roof slabs over the old shop are approxi-
mately 2 y2" thick and over the new shop are approximately 3"
thick. Both are covered with a good grade of tarred paper over
which is laid composition roofing.
The parts of the assembling building, bounding the old shop
are heated by direct hot water radiation. The parts of the same
building, bounding the new shop, are heated in the first story by
the new hot blast system and in the upper stories by direct hot
water radiation.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The air distributing system for the old shop consists of a se-
ries of overhead galvanized sheet iron pipes installed in the saw
teeth, through the trusses, with branches to alternate columns,
staggered. The outlets are turned to point directly at the floor
and in general terminate 9 feet above same. Each is provided
with a volume damper and adjustable quadrant at the main and
a pole operated butterflly damper at outlet. (See figure No. 5.)
This shop had been completed and was in operation when the
system was designed. Hence, it was necessary to use the over-
head system.
The distributing system in the new shop consists of under-
ground ducts with floor outlets located at alternate columns and
staggered as in the old shop. (See plan and Figure 6.) In
nearly all cases, the column is in the center of the outlet making
necessary a sliding sleeve damper. This damper is designed with
a conical deflecting bottom and is secured to the angles forming
the slots at the ends of a diameter by means of wing nuts and
studs. The lower part of each outlet box is formed by a screen
of No. 8 wire 1V2" diamond mesh, which forms an exit for the
air and the upper part is of galvanized sheet metal forming a
pocket into which the damper may slide. The top of the box
is formed by a cast iron plate. The boxes are of very substan-
tial construction as they will, without doubt, be used as shelves to
support various articles used in the shop and even parts going
through the manufacturing process. The dampers in these boxes
are to be used simply to adjust the flow of air to the outlets and
no means will be provided for temporarily shutting them off as
was the case with the overhead system. The velocity at the out-
let will not exceed 500 feet per minute and it is not expected that
it will ever be objectionable to employees working around it.
The underground distributing system consists of vitrified
sewer pipe for all diameters to 24": For sizes larger than this,
the sides are 8" and 12" brick walls plastered smooth on the inside,
and outside with cement mortar. The bottom is of concrete and
the top of reinforced concrete with all inside surfaces finished
smooth. The duct bottoms all pitch downward toward the low-
est point at the base of the fan riser. Any moisture accumulating
when the system is not in operation or any which will not be evap-
orated when the system is in operation is drained to a sump just


29
outside the duct through a water seal 12" deep. From the sump,
the water is pumped by a vertical centrifugal inclosed impeller
pump into the sewer, which is above the duct bottom at this point.
The system is designed to operate at 1.1 oz. dynamic pressure
with velocities approximately as follows in feet per minute:
Fresh air intake 1100
Free area through coils '....1200
Air washer entrance 700
Fan discharge 2935
Ducts 2270 graded to 1000
Outlets 500
In order to keep the operating cost at a minimum, multivane
fans were used. These are of the full housed type operating at
proper speeds to secure the above mentioned pressure.
On account of the cooling effect desired for summer operation,
the washers are of the humidifying type with atomizing nozzles,
discharging in a direction opposite to that of the movement of
the air. The water is recirculated from a tank beneath the nozzles
through a large gravity strainer, a horizontal centrifugal pump
with direct coupled motor, a pressure type pot strainer to the
spray nozzles. The pressure maintained on the discharge from
the pump is approximately 35 pounds varying somewhat in differ-
ent apparata.
The damper arrangement (See figures 2 and 3) at the appa-
ratus for each system in the new shop, is as follows:
The fresh air damper in the fresh air shaft has points on the
quadrant at which the arm may be bolted for full-opening, 15%
opening and closed. The usual operating position, when the shop
is occupied, will be at the 15% opening as this fraction of the to-
tal capacity will be all the air that is needed for ventilating. For
summer use, the damper will be wide open. When the shop is
unoccupied, it will be closed. The recirculating damper will have
the same points on the quadrant except the point for heating when
occupied which will be 75% opening. This fraction is used in
the place of 85% opening on account of the fact that there is no
duct connected with the recirculating damper and the 10% dif-
ference is to allow for the friction of the air shaft and thus se-
cure the 15% of fresh air needed. To diminish the friction for
summer use, doors are provided in the cone between the washer


and the heating coils to by-pass same as they will not be used at
this time.
The damper arrangement in the old shop is the same as above
except the by-pass around the heating coils, which it was not
convenient to secure on account of lack of space.
A somewhat novel point in the construction of these dampers
is the roller bearing used. This bearing is made of a pipe nipple
with 5/16-" or 3/8" round iron rollers inside and a cap on each
end through which an opening of proper size for the shaft has
been made. The largest of these dampers is 24 feet long by 6
feet wide and it can easily be operated with one hand. Screens


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
are provided over the fresli air intakes and over all recirculating
openings.
The heating medium for each system consists of one 4 row sec-
tion called a tempering coil to raise the temperature of the incom-
ing air above the freezing point but which, in general, will not be
used on account of the large amount of air recirculated, and seven
four-row sections called the heating coils. The tempering coil is
placed in the path of the air before it reaches the washer and the
heating coils are placed between the washer and the fan.
The coils are of the miter type of 1" pipe spaced 2^4" centers
with alternate rows staggered. In order to properly adjust the
delivery temperature of the water, the piping connections for the
coils are arranged and valved so that they may be connected in
series or in any arrangement of plain multiple or series multiple.
The capacities of fan motors are indicated in the following
table:
Apparatus Fan Capacity H. P. of

3 158.700 85

5 81,700 50
The general building data is as follows for the new shop. The
walls of the craneway were not considered as exposure as this is
used for storage purposes and is bounded on both sides by the
shops.
The glass in the roof has northeast exposure but as it is in
sawtooth construction, no percentage was added for same.
Walls, east exposure glass 5,900 sq. ft.
east exposure wall 4,719 sq. ft.
north exposure glass 2,968 sq. ft.
north exposure wall 3,282 sq. ft.
south exposure glass 5,546 sq. ft.
south exposure wall 5,674 sq. ft.
west exposure none
Roof glass 47,871 sq. ft.
slab 162,042 sq. ft.
Volume 3,442,184 cu. ft.

In calculating the heat losses, the following units were used as
losses in B. T. U. per sq. ft. per degree Fah. difference in tem-
perature
An addition of 25% was made to surfaces with north expos-
ure. As the buildings will be heated continuously, the volume
was not considered.
The total heat loss for a temperature difference of 65° Fah.
on the above basis is 13,646,815 B. T. U. per hour. The owner
desired to use the return water from the heaters in the cooling
system of the gas engine which furnishes power for the plant and
specified that the temperature of same must not exceed 140° Fah.
With this low temperature of delivery, it was not deemed ad-
visable to expect a temperature of the delivered air above 1100
Fah. and the calculations were made on this basis.
One pound of air at no0 Fah. has a volume at atmospheric
pressure of 14.344 cu. ft. (Kent) and the specific heat at constant
pressure is .2375. Hence, one'pound cooling from no3 to 65s
or 450 will impart 45 x .2375 or 10.7 B. T. U. The loss per min-
ute is 13.646.815-^60 or 227,447 B. T. U.
The number of pounds required per minute is:
This quantity, reduced to cu. ft. is 21257 x r4-344 = 3°49IO»
which is the quantity in cu. ft. per minute required for heating
purposes if delivered from outlets at 1100. On account of the
loss in the ducts and to provide for better results in cooling, the
capacity finally decided on was 329,100 cu. ft. per minute and two
units of this combined capacity were used. The air change pro-
duced is once in every 10.4 minutes.
The cooling problem was calculated as follows: The space
supplied with air from the two systems will contain probably 2,000
men and power used, about 1500 H. P. The only heat gain from
the sum considered was on the south exposure. The roof will,
of course, receive heat from this source but as the cool air will
be admitted at the floor level and will be discharged through the
roof, any heat gain from this source will not affect the occupants.

The heat gain from the east exposure was not considered as it oc-
curs during the cooler part of the day and when the heat gain
from the south exposure is at a minimum.
The total heat gain per hour is as follows:
South exposure (wall neglected)

2000 men at 400 B. T. U 800,000

Total B. T. U. per hour 4.783,880
Total B. T. U. per minute 79.731
It is desired that the incoming air absorb as much as possible
of this heat. The guarantees in the air washer contract, are made
under a severe forfeiture and specify that the air delivered from
the washer shall not exceed the wet bulb temperature of the incom-
ing by more than i° Fall. The wet bulb temperature of Detroit
very rarely exceeds 75° and is usually in the hottest weather
much lower than this. Hence we can consider the maximum tem-
perature of the delivered air as 71V Fah.
The number of heat units per minute to be absorbed by each
pound of incoming air—
79.731 -=- 21.257 = 375
One pound of saturated air at 750 Fah. and atmospheric pres-
sure will contain approximately .0177 pounds of water vapor.
As we are considering the dewpoint as 75 Fah. the air would be
saturated at this point and each pound of air at 7(1° would contain
.0177 pounds of moisture. Considering the specific heat of the
vapor as .463 and as that of the air is .2375, the total heat to be
absorbed by warming one pound of air with the contained vapor
1 Fah. would be the product of .463 and .0177 or .0082 plus .2375
which equals .2457 T. U. The rise in temperature of each
pound of air after entering the shop would be the quotient of 3.75
divided by .2457 or 15.2' Fah. and the maximum temperature of
the shop will be 760 plus 15.2° or 91.2° Fah.
The average temperature however will be much lower than
this depending on the humidity of the outside air. When the
washers are in operation considerable quantity of moisture will
be carried into the shop but no ill results are anticipated on ac-
count of the heat produced within the building.

THE J. T. JONES STEP PROCESS FOR THE METALLIZ-
ATION OF LOW GRADE IRON ORES.
A. E. WHITE
At the present writing there is probably no more interesting
experiment being carried on, than that which Mr. J. T. Jones is
conducting at Republic, Michigan. The experiment proper con-
sists in the endeavor to convert into a commercial product the vast
cfuantities of low grade iron ores which are found on the Mar-
quette, Menominee, Gogebic, Vermilion, and Mesaba Ranges; but
especially those found on the Menominee and Marquette Ranges.
Mr. Jones has been working on this experiment since September.
1908. He has spent vast sums of money in carrying out his ideas
and in making such changes as became necessary from time to
time and there is little doubt but what in a very few months the
results of his work will be definitely known, and one can then be
certain as to whether or not the metalization of low grade iron
ores will prove to be a commercial success.
I'efore proceeding further it should be made clear that it will
probably become true that the Jones process will not be appli-
cable to all types of low grade iron ores found on the iron ranges,
but only to those possessing certain definite characteristics. In spite
of this narrowing of the proposition, there is little question but
what his processes applicable to extremely large quantities of iron
ore, and for that reason it is the writer's belief that the vast sums
of money which have already been spent are altogether warrant-
able. This narrowing of the process is but following the common
law of all ore dressing operations, for in all work of this nature
there is no one process or no one portion of a process which is ap-
plicable to all grades and types of ore.
Not since the early days when steel was made in this country
in a Bessemer converter for the first time, at Wyandotte. Michi-
gan, has an experiment been carried on containing such possibili-
ties. There has never been an experiment carried on in the bor-
ders of Michigan which, if successful, will mean more to this
State than the experiment which Mr. Jones is doing at Republic,
and which had its origin and the beginning of its development


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
at Iron Mountain. It is a process and a scheme which is worthy
of the kindest criticism and which is well worth being financially
backed for the possibilities of financial returns which it posesses.
The experiment in brief is to remove the oxygen from the
iron oxide of low grade iron ore by bringing it into contact with
the volatile matters of coal or wood and likewise the fixed carbon
which is found in the coal or wood. This leaves the iron in the
ore in a metallic condition without in any way fluxing or melting
the iron or gangue found in the ore. By a later process of mag-
netic concentration the iron will be freed from its gangue and
there will be obtained as a result a product by all means fit for
blast furnace use and possibly of such a high grade as to be ac-
ceptable for open hearth use.
It is true that Mr. Jones has met with considerable criticism
with regard to the possibility of success for his proposition. Most
of this criticism has come from men who have vast sums of money
invested in blast furnaces and other modern steel making ap-
pliances and who regard this process as alien to their best inter-
ests rather than as a supplement to the present methods of iron
and steel making now in vogue. Some have even gone so far as to
condemn his proposition after but a very hasty and superficial
glance at its possibilities and little if any weight should be given
to such condemnation.
On the other hand there are many men who are warm sup-
porters of Mr. Jones' idea. They realize the great hesitancy with
which new schemes are first received. They further realize that
at the start there are many factors which have to be met before
any new proposition is worked out to a financial operating success.
Of course the crucial crux to the entire process lies in the
amount of fuel which it will be necessary to consume in metal-
izing one ton of product. In an operation which Mr. Jones car-
ried out last winter at Iron Mountain similar to the present one
in principle although with a different type of roaster, 85 pounds
of fuel was consumed per 100 pounds of product metallized. The
inventor was taken sick and for a short period the writer handled
the experiment and by judicial and careful work he was able to
bring the fuel consumption down to 52 pounds of fuel per 100
pounds of product metallized. The writer, however, is of the firm
belief that it will require but 40 pounds of fuel per hundred


37
pounds of ore to bring about satisfactory metallization. In this
figure he is assuming the use of fixed carbon alone. Theoretically
it requires but about 26% of soft coal to do the work necessary
in metallizing, and with an allowance of 40% there is therefore
15% excess. Of course there is no question but that the volatile
matters in the coal wil metallize ore providing the ore is kept in
contact with the volatile gases for a sufficiently long period. It is
extremely difficult to do this on a commercial scale for the vola-
tile gases always have a tendecy to escape and at the present time
there is no mechanical appliance known that is capable of keep-
ing the gases and a product such as low grade iron ore in contact
for a period sufficiently long to allow of the complete metalliza-
tion of the ore. It is because of the difficulty of metallizing with
hydrocarbons that the writer has based his calculations on the
fixed carbon found in coal.
There is a further possibility of making use of the large quan-
tities of waste wood that are found in the vicinities of the low
grade ore deposits as the metallurgical fuel to be used in the re-
duction. Such a possibility as this is worth considering on a small
scale. It cannot assume large proportions, however, because of
the fact that the supply of wood in the State of Michigan is rap-
idly decreasing and it will be but a question of time before the
entire supply is practically consumed. For that reason it is only
just that the process when looked at from the larger aspect should
seek its fuel from coal.
Mr. J. T. Jones was led to the conception of his process for
the utilization of the low grade iron ores because of the immense
tonnages which are found in the Lake Superior region and be-
cause of the immense possibilities which a successful method for
the treatment of the ores posess. Before arriving at his scheme
of metallizing he considered and threw aside practically all other
methods which might be used for the recovery of the values found
in low grade ores. It seems to the writer that for the most part
he was quite justified in taking the attitude which he did, for he
was chiefly interested in the ores which were found in the Me-
nominee and Marquette districts. These ores are quite hard and
recent experiment lias shown that they are not treatable in ac-
cordance with modern methods of wet gravity ore dressing or
milling.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The inventor at first felt, that with the proper tools he could
reduce the iron found in the low grade ores to a metallic sponge,
while keeping the temperature throughout this portion of the op-
eration at a point below the melting point of both the iron and
of the slag forming constituents. When in a metallized condition
the product was then to be heated to a temperature sufficiently
high to flux the gangue—gangue which for the most part was
silica and which was to be fluxed with iron oxide—but at a tem-
perature not hot enough to melt the iron. It was then to be the
endeavor to squeeze out the liquid impurities from the pasty iron.
After many trials, however, it was learned that there was no
known means of getting a fire brick lining which would stand
up under the fluxing action of the iron oxide present in the prod-
uct. To carry out this idea Mr. Jones erected near his home at
Iron Mountain a large kiln 120 feet long and 8 feet in internal
diameter which was supplemented with such necessary accesso-
ries as crushers, crushing rolls, elevators, screens, etc. His idea at
that time was to put the ore into the kiln at one end and have it
come out at the discharge end in such a condition that the slag
would be liquid and the metallized metal would be pasty, capable
of immediate working into commercial muck bar. The difficulty
with this scheme as stated above was the fact that the lining of
the kiln would not withstand the fluxing action of the iron oxide.
All types and kinds of fire brick were used, including such kinds
as magnesite brick, chrome brick, silica brick, fire clay brick, etc..
but to no avail.
His next idea was to keep the temperatures in the kiln down
to a point which would metallize the iron ore present, but which
would not melt either the ore or the gangue. At almost the first
attempt Mr. Jones succeeded in getting the type of product which
he wished: a product wherein the iron oxide present in the low
grade ore was reduced to metallic iron. His difficulty here was
the fact that fuel consumption was too high and the formation of
a ring in the tube made continuous operation an impossibility.
In order to overcome the first difficulty Mr. Jones conceived
the idea of allowing the volatile hydrocarbon gases in the bitumi-
nous coal to do the work. Such action, he felt, would result in a
reduction of the iron oxide to a spongy metallic iron. It is from
this step that the process called "metallizing" has derived its


39
name. He had been able to carry out this idea in a crucible test,
for without any difficulty whatever he had converted the iron in an
iron ore to a metallic sponge and had converted into coke the bi-
tuminous coal from which he had derived the necessary hydrocar-
bons.
His great claim for the commercial success of the process
lay in the fact that while he was converting the iron in iron ore to
a metal he was, at the same time, producing a merchantable coke
which, because of its value, would , in itself, more than pay for
this particular step in the process.
So far Mr. Jones has had considerable difficulty in metallizing
in his long tube by means of the volatile hydrocarbons. In fact
one can state that as yet he has never succeeded in metallizing
on a continuous commercial scale by means of the volatile hydro-
carbons. Mr. Jones himself is aware of this difficulty and as the
first step toward overcoming it. he inserted a charging door in his
kiln two-thirds of the distance in f rem the feed end. At that point
he inserted bituminous coal. 1 lis idea was to first allow the ore
to become hot by means of contact with the escaping gases and
through the combustion of a small quantity of fuel which he fed
in with the ore. and after the ore had reached the necessary heat
—which may be expressed as dull yellow because of the color of
the ore—he added to it the bituminous coal which would furnish
the hydrocarbons necessary to carry out the reduction of the iron
in the iron ore to a metallic sponge. This step in the process was
to be accompanied by the production of coke, for it was the en-
deavor to have the heat sufficiently great to free the coal of its
volatile matter but not great enough to burn or consume the coke
made after the expulsion of the volatile matter from the coal.
In carrying out this idea, two difficulties were encountered.
In the first place the chemical and heat action at the point where
the coal was fed into the tube was so great as to cause too much
heat at this point. This caused melting of the gangue constituents
of the ore and likewise metallization of a certain quantity of the
iron in the iron ore so that the mass became pasty. These con-
ditions caused the materials to cling to the sides of the kiln in
this vicinity and within 23 hours after this type of charging was
resorted to. further use of the tube has to be abandoned until the
ring was cleared away. The second difficulty was the trouble


TIIE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
encountered in getting the coal which was charged through the
side door underneath the ore burden. It was impossible to
revolve the kiln faster than one revolution in 20 minutes. The
kiln was fed with ore varying in sizes of from 2" pieces to as
small as dust. The larger pieces went through the kiln at a much
faster rate than the smaller pieces did. To secure complete
metallization of the entire product, it was necessary to adjust
the speed of the kiln to suit the larger pieces of ore. For that
reason the slow speed had to be adopted. Because of the slow
speed the ore as it passed clown through the kiln slid rather than
showered, and because of this sliding action it was impossible to
get the coal which was fed through the side door underneath the
ore burden. For that reason the most of the possibilities that
lay in metallizing through the use of the volatile hydrocarbons
could not be utilized.
It may be safely stated that in practically all of the long runs
which were made at Iron Mountain, it was the fixed carbon in
the coal and not the volatile hydrocarbons which did the metalliz-
ing.
Mr. Jones appreciates this difficulty. In the early part of his
experiments he endeavored to put lifters inside the tube. The
lifters did not last, however, because the two kinds which he used
were not adapted for the idea; the first one being a fire brick
which was mechanically too weak to stand it and the other a
concrete one which was not adaprible to withstanding heat.
In order to meet this issue more effectively Mr. Jones began,
last spring, the erection of a metallizing plant at Republic. Mich-
igan. He located the plant at the shaft head of the Kloman Mine
for it is from this particular mine that the ore to be treated will
be obtained . Mr. Jones has met with considerable criticism for
utilizing this ore in his metallizing experiments, as it is claimed
that it is the ore of ores on the Menominee Range most adaptable
for the process laid forth. There is no question but what this ore
is of a type which can be treated successfully in accordance with
the proposed process, if any ore can be so treated. It appeals to
the writer as though such criticisms are somewhat unjust because
there is no question but what Mr. Jones has enough available ore
in this one property to warrant the entire expense to which he
has been placed if his proposition works out successfully and a


41
proposition ought to be developed along lines most favorable for
its advancement.
At the present writing it is the intention to mine the ore in the
Kloman property according to the Glory Hole system made use
of so commonly in the western part of our country, especially in
the mining of our low grade copper ores. The ore will be hoisted
to the surface and crushed in a No. 6 McCulley Gyratory Crusher.
It will then be sized on a \]/2 inch bar grizzly and the oversize
will be again crushed on a No. 4 Gates Gyratory Crusher. The
whole product will then pass through rolls and screens until it is
broken down to sizes % of an inch in diameter or smaller. The
product will then be placed in Iiruckner roasters, fifteen tons at
a time, for the purpose of metallizing. The process is an inter-
mittent one and for that reason the roasters are arranged in series
of two. One is metallizing the ore while the other is acting as a
preheater having the ore which is present in it heated up by the
passage through it of the waste gases from the first roaster. After
the product in the initial roaster is metallized the ore is then
flumped into a water-sprayed pocket. Fuel is then added to the
second roaster, likewise ore is added to the first roaster. Metal-
lizing then takes place in the second roaster with the passage of
the waste gases through the first roaster for the purpose of
heating up the ore therein. The metallized ore from the pocket
is passed to a jig for the purpose of removing any good merchant-
able coke which may be present. The concentrates are then carried
to a 1'ruckner drier and from there are crushed to a proper size
and then magnetically separated, with a final concentrate of such
a grade as can be used in a blast furnace as an ore or else as a
product for open hearth use.

The Bruckner roasters themselves, around which centers the
entire success or failure of the proposition, are of a type so com-
monly made use of in the ore dressing operations of non-ferrous
metals. Each one is i8'6" long and 8'8" in internal diameter.
They require 12 H. P. to start and but 5 H. P. when in operation.
It is expected that each one will hold fifteen tons of ore at a
charge, and it is hoped to consume but four hours for the metal-
lizing operation, two of which will be used in heating up the ore
and two in the reduction or metallization. By having them placed
in series of two and by having the waste gases from one pass into
the other, it is expected that from two roasters a charge of fifteen
tons of ore will be available every two hours. The roasters them-
selves are equipped with oil burners for the purpose of giving
-supplementary and initial heat. Charges of coal will be put into


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the roasters at the proper time for the purpose of completing the
reduction of the ore. The roasters have a 9-inch lining of tire
brick and at definite portions throughout the inside shell of the
roaster are placed fire brick projections which will serve as lifters
for the purpose, if possible, of getting coal underneath the ore in
order that the escaping volatile gases may have an opportunity
to come into close contact with the ore as possible. The tube
itself will revolve at varying speeds depending upon conditions.
It has a variance of from one revolution in forty minutes to ten
revolutions per minute.
The entire metallizing and concentrating plant is electrically
driven. For this reason it has the following motors installed:
One 75 H. P. A. C. induction motor. This for the Xo. 6 and
No. 4 crushers, all the elevators in the crushing plant, and
in fact everything up to the Avery scale.
One 20 H. P. Variable speed reversible Western Electric mo-
tor. This for one tube and for ore elevator to Avery
scale.
One 20 H. P. Variable speed reversible Western Electric mo-
tor. This for one tube and for driving the ore charging
larry.
One 20 FT. P. Variable speed reversible Western Electric mo-
tor. This for drier and for the coal-charging larry.
One 5 H. P. A. C. induction motor. This for coal hoist.
One 40 H. P. A. C. induction motor. This for separating
plant.
One 6 H. P. D. C. generator. This to be driven by the 40 H.
P. motor for the purpose of generating D. C. for the mag-
netic separators.
One 5 H. P A. C. induction motor. This for a No. 2]/2 cen-
trifugal pump.
To carry out the housing of this experiment it has been nec-
essary to erect a set of completely new buildings. These are alto-
gether of the reenforced concrete type. Three large buildings
have been constructed, one of which is known as the Generator
Building, another as the Pioiler House and Machine Shop Build-
ing, and the third as the Mill. The first of these, or the Generator
Building, is 40 feet long and 30 feet wide. It consists of but one
story and is II feet high. In it is 1-200 H. P. Corliss Engine and


45
I-150 K. W. Western Electric A. C. Generator, furnishing 440
volts. This generator is equipped with an exciter, switch board,
rheostat.and the other paraphernalia which go to make up an elec-
tric station.
The lioiler House and Machine Shop is all under one roof, in
a building 125 feet long, 18 feet wide and 8 feet high. The Boiler
House proper is 40 feet long and 18 feet wide; and the Machine
Shop, containing the air-compressors and hoists, is 60 feet long
and 18 feet wide. The Boiler House contains 1-250 H. P. Conti-
nental water tube boiler. There is 1-15 H. P. upright boiler and
1 exhaust water heater. In the Machine Shop section of the
house is found one ten drill Ingersoll-Sargeant Compressor, one
four drill compressor of the same type, one Webster-Camp &amp; Lane
five foot drum 2nd motion hoist, one 20 inch lathe, one drill press,
and one shaper.
The Boiler and Generator Houses are placed at a distance of
about 400 feet from the Mill. The Mill is directly at the head
of the shaft. This arrangement will l&gt;e noted from an examination
of the accompanying photograph. The general arrangement of
the layout in the Mill can also be noted from an examination of
the How sheet of the process found in this chapter.
At the present time there is a great difference of opinion as to
just what will be the cost of making iron from metallized ore. If


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
it is possible to get a product containing approximately 95% of
iron, with but 4% to 5% of gangue and under .05% sulphur there
will be no question but what such a metal could be successfully
used in an open-hearth furnace. It is true that there might be
some objection to its use in such a furnace because of its fineness,
but because of the general physical nature of the Kloman ore it
will probably be true that such an objection would not hold. .
The main trouble will without doubt be with its quality. It
will probably be impossible to obtain a product containing more
than 85% of iron, and such a product, because of the high per-
centage of gangue necessarily present, would find no ready sale
for open-hearth use. There is another great objection, which as
yet has not been emphasized, and that is the great affinity which
this material has for sulphur from the surrounding coal with
which it is in contact. It will probably be true that after metal-
lizing the resulting metal will contain not less than from .1% to
.2% sulphur. For this particular reason it becomes manifest that
the natural outlet for this material will be in a blast furnace. For
that reason the fears of so many people that the installation of
the Jones process for the utilization of the low grade iron ores
will completely revolutionize the present practice of making steel
is nothing more nor less than a visionary bubble.

In arriving at this estimate the natural ore is credited with
containing but \c/o of moisture and 42% of gangue of which
35% is silicon. As we lose 20% of the iron present in our pro-
cess of magnetic concentration it will be necessary to use 2.66 tons
of crude ore in order to get a concentrate containing 85% of
iron.
It has been the endeavor to make the crushing, screening, con-
centrating, conveying, jigging, and repair costs full high and there
is little doubt in the writer's mind but what the actual operating
costs of certain of these items will be materially reduced when
operating on a large scale.
The smelting center adopted has been Chicago. The cost of
the metallized ore at this point will prove to be approximately
$.08 a unit. It will roughly require Yi a ton of limestone to do
the necessary fluxing. The amount of coke that will be required
to smelt this product is at present a matter of mere guess work.
Allowing .8 of a ton of coke for a ton of silica as our basis for
the amount of coke required to flux out the silica and 300 lbs. of
coke for a ton of metal as our basis for melting the metallic iron
present in the product, it is thus estimated that but approximately
500 lbs. of coke are required per ton of pig iron. 1,000 lbs have
been allowed and the doubling of the requirement seems more
than ample.
Adding up all of the various items it is observed that it will
cost but approximately $12.00 to make a ton of pig iron out of
manv of Michigan's vast number of low grade iron ore deposits.


THE MICHICAN TECHNIC
It is believed that this figure allows ample allowance for any con-
tingencies that may come up. It does not take into account the
fact that there is a possibility of making a salable coke as a by
product. It does not take into account the fact that there is a pos-
sibility that a product of high enough grade for open hearth use
may be made. It has put, colloquially speaking, the worst foot
forward and the figures show that it is a proposition worth de-
veloping.
We will all watch with great interest the growth of the ideas
which Mr. J. T. Jones has clung to so tenaciously the past few
years and we sincerely trust that within the next six months he
will be able to break down the present bars of skepticism by hav-
ing at hand actual proof concerning what can be done with regard
to the metallization of certain types of Michigan's low grade iron
ores.

THE REES ROTURBO PUMP.
by Matthew R. Rush, 'ii.
The centrifugal pump has made another step forward. Dur-
ing the early stages of its development a high pressure type of
pump was almost unknown, most of the work done by the cen-
trifugal pumps at that time being of the low-head large-quantity
character, for which reciprocating pumps would have had excess-
ively large dimensions. At the beginning of the twentieth century
the high pressure type came into use, and due to the rapid growth
of its usefulness, centrifugal pump design has undergone a re-
markable stage of development in the last ten or twelve years.
One of the latest of the high pressure type and a pump which
has attracted considerable attention, particularly in Europe, is the
Rees Roturbo Pump built in that country by the Rees Roturbo
Mfg. Co. of Wolverhampton. England, while in this country the
manufacture of this pump has been recently started by the Man-
istee Iron Works Co. of Manistee, Mich. The main novel feature
of this pump is what the English inventor has called "self-regu-
lation," meaning by this that the characteristic pump curves (the
discharge-head, the discharge-efficiency, and the discharge-power
curves) are of such a nature that overloading of the pump motor
is impossible.
This is brought about by the peculiar design- of the impeller,
which instead of converging gradually in profile from the entrance
to the discharge area retains nearly the same area from the
entrance to very near the discharge and converges suddenly to
the nozzle-like discharge areas in the rim of the impeller. (See
Pig. i. ) Thus a chamber of relatively large volume makes up
the major part of the impeller, in which chamber a pressure is
created by the rotative action. The nozzles are fed from this
chamber, which in turn receives its supply from the suction pipe.
The rate of flow thru the impeller is very low. due to the relatively
large volume, and hence changes in the quantity discharged pro-
ducing variations in the rate of flow, will have a very slight effect
upon the pressure conditions in the chamber. Consequently the
theoretical power of the pump is practically dependent only on


the head against which it is working, and equally independent of
the discharge, which means that with variations in the discharge
it is impossible to cause very great variations in the power
required.
FiS. 1.
This means a flat power curve, and this feature is still fur-
ther made possible by the turbine effect of the nozzles in the rim of
the impeller. These act as turbine buckets and create a force of
reaction acting in the direction of rotation. This is useful me-
chanical work and it increases as the discharge increases, thus
neutralizing to some extent the increase of the hydraulic losses
which occurs with an increased quantity.
From these considerations there may be expected, theoretical-
ly, a flat power curve, and a very good total efficiency.
In October, 1911. one of the Rees Pumps was sent by the Man-
istee Iron Works Co. to the University of Michigan with the re-
quest to investigate the same as to the claimed features. The
test made by Prof. Zowski was at the normal speed of 1660 R. P.
M., but thru the courtesy of the company the author was allowed
to make additional tests to be used by him as basis for a Master's


51
degree thesis, "The Theory of the Characteristic Pump Curves."
It is proposed to give in this article only a brief description of the
pump and a general discussion of the tests and pump curves ob-
tained.
The pump upon which the tests were made was designed to de-
liver 10,000 Imperial gallons or 12,000 U. S. gallons of water per
hour against a head of 100 feet. It is approximately 24 inches
wide and 4 feet long. The suction and discharge pipes are each
3 inches in diameter, the suction pipe having a horizontal and the
discharge pipe a vertical connection. There are two impellers, 8
inches in diameter, and each contains two stages, so arranged that
the first and fourth stages come in the center and the second and
third on the outside. This arrangement gives perfect balancing,
as the water is led into the first and third stages in an opposite
direction to that in which it enters the second and fourth stages.
The entrance angle of the blades is about 29 degrees, and the dis-
charge angle about 160 degrees. There are six vanes to each im-
peller at the suction diameter, which number is increased to twelve
at the discharge in order to better guide the water. The angle
of the guide vanes in the diffusor is about fourteen degrees, and
these are six in number. The radial clearance between the impel-
ler and the tips of the diffusor vanes is ^4 inch.
The pump was belt connected to a direct current 15 horse-
power motor by means of a four inch, single-ply belt. The motor
pulley was 18 inches in diameter, and the pump pulley was 8
inches. The motor was provided with rheostat control in order
10 give the various speeds to the pump. The means of varying
the head was a throttle valve placed in the discharge line near the
outlet into the weighing tank. The pressure head was measured
by a pressure gage in the discharge line just at the exit from the
pump; and the suction head was measured by a mercury gage in
the suction line at the entrance to the pump. The quantity of
water was determined by means of a 50,000 pound weighing tank,
from which, after weighing, the water was discharged thru a
large sliding valve in the floor of the tank, operated by air pres-
sure. The course of the water was from the main canal in the
laboratory, which is connected to the naval tank by means of a
large gate valve, thru the pump into the weighing tank, and back
into the naval tank by a return canal. On account of the very


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
large capacity of the naval tank (about 6,000 square feet of water
.surface) the water level did not fluctuate to any noticeable degree,
and in the computations was considered constant. The pump was
tested at speeds of 1,200. 1.400, 1.660, and 1,700 R. P. M.
The results of the tests (not published here) were computed
in the following manner:—
The suction and discharge pressures were converted into feet
of water, and the total head on the pump was found by the addition
of suction head, the discharge head, and the difference in feet be-
tween the point of attachment of the suction gage and the center
of the pressure gage. This gives the pump credit for the friction
head in the suction pipe, strainer and foot valve, and also for the
speed head, as the suction head was measured by a gage.
The pounds of water per second were obtained from the scales
by noting the time taken for the pumping of a certain quantity,
and converted into cubic feet per second by the formula.
Lbs. per second,
Cu. ft. per second =
y
in which y is the weight of a cubic foot of water corresponding to
the temperature. This quantity was then converted into U. S. gal-
lons per minute for use in plotting by the formula.
U. S. gallons per minute = Cu. ft. per second x 7.47 x 60.
The water horse power was then obtained by the formula,
7QH.
W. HP= ——
550
in which Q is in cubic feet per second and If, in feet.
The motor horse-power was obtained by multiplying the cur-
rent input by the voltage by the efficiency of the motor (obtained
from a series of tests previously run) and by the factor, 1/746.
The efficiency of the pump and the belt drive combined was
obtained by dividing the water horse-power by the motor horse-
power.
Curves.
The discharge-head, discharge-efficiency, discharge-water horse
power and discharge-motor horse-power curves for the speed of
1660 R. P. M. are shown on Curve Sheet Xo. 1.
The head curve is typical of all high pressure pumps, falling
off slightly from the small-quantity to zero-quantity conditions.


53
Tlie expectations as regards the flatness of the power and effi-
ciency curves are fulfilled. At the normal conditions (point of
best efficiency) the HP required is 13, while the maximum HP is
U S CALLOUS f£H
n» &gt;ei f
HINUTE
only 13.3.and thus an overload of only 13.3/13= 1.025, or 2-5c/° ^s
possible. Thus if a break in the discharge line occurs, or the dis-
charge valve is suddenly thrown full open so that the head is re-
duced suddenly from a maximum to a minimum, there is no dan-
ger of throwing a heavy overload on the motor and burning it out.
On the efficiency curve the maximum point at 190 gallons per min-
ute is 71%. The two quantities corresponding to the 60% points
are 110 and 255 gallons per minute. Thus, while the quantity de-
creases to 58% or increases to 134% of the normal, the efficiency
drops only 11 points.
The efficiency curve takes into account the losses in the belt,
and hence the actual efficiency curve of the pump will be somewhat
higher than the one shown. The flatness of the curve around
normal conditions of quantity and head indicates a careful design
of the impeller and guide vanes, and also illustrates the turbine
effect, mentioned above.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
On curve sheet No. 2 are shown the discharge-head curves for
the various R. P. M. The actual curves obtained from the tests
are shown in the full lines, while the curves shown by broken lines
ic* at t*t tf 1— **c
U.S. GALLOW f&gt;£R niNUTE
are deduced from the curve at normal speed of 1660 R. P. M. by
the following formulae:—
1660^
//.
in which Q and H are the quantity and head at 1660 R. P. M., and
Q' and H' are the quantity and head at N' R. P. M. A very close
coincidence of the theoretical and actual curves occurs, except in
the case of 1400 R. P. M. test at small quantities. This variation
is probably due to inaccurate reading of the instruments at these
points.
On curve sheets Xos. 3, 4, and 5 similar deductions from the
water horse-power, motor horse-power, and efficiency curves at
1660 R. P. M. are made, and comparisons between the actual and
theoretical curves are seen. A greater actual than theoretical effi-


55
ciency is seen on Curve Sheet No. 5 in the curve of the 1200 R. P.
M. test, but as this curve contains also the losses in the belt, the
difference is clue to the decreased belt losses and belt slip at the
lower speed. Due to inaccuracy in the readings this point is not
brought out in the 14.00 R. P. M. test.
For plotting the theoretical horse-power curves the quantities
were calculated as before and the horse-power found from the
formula.
HP
'=(7355)
UP
The efficiencies were then found by dividing the theoretical water
horse-powers by the corresponding theoretical motor horse-
powers.
It was necessary to discontinue the 1700 R. P. M. test at the
point shown on account of heating of the motor and cable con-
ductor, due to the large current, and hence a comparison of the
theoretical and actual curves at small quantities is impossible.

From an investigation of the impeller, which the author has
conducted to determine the various shock losses at the entrance to
and discharge from the impeller, the area of discharge of one im-
peller was found to be 0.0168 square feet. At the best efficiency
point the quantity of water is 0.424 cubic feet per second. Hence
the speed of the water issuing from the impeller nozzles is
0.424 — 0.0168 — 25.2 feet per second. From the R. P. M. and
the diameter of the impeller the peripheral speed was found to be


57
57.9 feet per second. Thus it is seen that the speed of the issuing
jet is approximately one-half of the peripheral speed of the im-
peller, which is the reverse of the conditions in a Pelton wheel
in which the peripheral speed of the wheel, at best efficiency, is
one-half that of the impinging jet.
Due to the fact that the water in the impeller is practically sta-
tionary in relation to it, the Rees pump has had a large field in
mine and colliery work, where the pump runs continuallly in dirty,
gritty water, since the wear, which usually results, is reduced to a
minimum. There have been instances, in which pumps, after be-
ing run for several years in gritty mine water, have been opened
and have shown almost no evidence of any scouring action.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
EDITORIALS
In contrast to the policy formerly adhered to, the Technic
next year is to be published monthly. It is hoped to make it thus
a better magazine both with regard to finances and to the interests
of students and alumni. It is to be, in a way, fostered by the
English Department as is explained in the following statement,
which Dr. Breitenbach has been kind enough to prepare for us.
The Michigan -Technic has had an honorable career of a
quarter of a century. The service it has performed in that time
to the students of the engineering department, to the alumni and
to the department in general is assuredly considerable. Among
its editors have been numbered some of the ablest of Michigan's
undergraduates; in its pages have appeared articles of widespread
interest to engineers; and through the agency of the publication
not a little fame has accrued to the engineering department. Fi-
nancially, however, the Technic has never been an unqualified
success. In 1901 publication was suspended for a year on account
of lack of funds. Two years ago the journal again became in-
volved in financial embarrassment from which it emerged only
through the generosity of certain friends among the faculty and
alumni. At the present time it is still not self-supporting, an an-
nual deficit being shouldered by the Engineering Society under the
auspices of which it has always been published.
However, in the opinion of all who are familiar with the work
done by the Technic, it is a useful agency and one to be encour-
aged and aided in its efforts. In order, therefore, to place the
publication upon a sounder financial basis and at the same time to
increase its usefulness, important improvements are planned for
next year. Hereafter, instead of semi-annually, the Technic
will appear monthly during the school year, liy reason of its
more frequent publication it will be in a position to print material
of greater timeliness, including University news of general interest
to its readers. Also it will serve as a more convenient medium of
communication between the alumni and faculty on the one hand
and the students on the other. As the rate will not be increased,
it is hoped to secure a much larger subscription list among both


9
alumni and students; and as the number of issues will be quadru-
pled, a considerable increase is expected in the revenue from ad-
vertisements.
Moreover, the cooperation of the English Department has
been enlisted. In its new form, the Technic will require a much
greater amount of journalistic work, which will be under the su-
pervision of this department. Arrangements have also been made
by which, under specified conditions, university credit in technical
journalism may be given for editorial work on the publication.
Finally freshman students of the department will be enrolled as
subscribers at a special rate; and the Technic will be used to
further the work of the beginning courses in English.
This progressive step on the part of the Technic is in line
with several innovations recently inaugurated in the Engineering
Department. Undoubtedly, a new era marked by consideration
for the needs of the individual student is denoted by such recent
departures as the freshman assembly, the system of advisers, the
increased number of hours open for cultural electives, and the
greater range of choice permitted among the technical studies, es-
pecially in the reorganized Civil department. To this work of
promoting the welfare of the student body in the Engineering De-
partment, the new- Technic will add its influence and help; and
it is hoped that its efforts will be appreciated by all its readers,
both old and new.

UP-TO-DATE PHOTOGRAPHY
BY W. F. DAVIDSON, '13E.
ALTHOUGH it is but seventy-
three years since Daguerre
gave the world its first prac-
tical photograph—the old daguerreo-
type—photography is today one of the
most commonly known and widely
used branches of science and art. Not
only is it the means of livelihood of
thousands of professional photograph-
ers, the basis of the moving-picture
business and a large department of
the public press, a source of entertain-
ment and an object of study for mul-
titudes of amateurs, but it has become
a valuable tool in the hands of nearly
every scientist, engineer, and man of
other profession.
Its rapid growth and development
possess many wonders, and it would
be interesting to trace them down
through the last three-quarters of a
century. The story would be that of
the intensive lives of chemists, lens
and instrument makers, enthusiastic
and untiring in their efforts. It would
relate, also, to many persons of com-
mercial mind, who saw in the perfec-
tion of this new and rapid process of
picture making, opportunities for for-
tune. And it would show how, step
by step, the process was improved,
simplified and economised until, at the
present day, scenes and happenings of
the whole world are copied by it for
broadcast distribution in magazines
and daily newspapers, the crimnal is
identified and justice made more sim-
ple and certain, and the problems and
accomplishments of the engineer, the
astronomer, the surgeon, illustrated
and preserved in journals and text-
tocks for the permanent use of pos-
terity.
This interesting story may be
gleaned, however, from the many texts
and histories on the subject. It is not
within the possibilities of this article
with regard to space, nor yet within
its scope with regard to intention, the
purpose here benig rather to explain
up-to-date photography by the mech-
anisms and processes now in use.
Cameras, lenses and shutters will be
considered, with their different adap-
tations, and thereafter plates, films
and printing papers, together with va-
rious developing processes.
The simplest type of camera is the
box-camera, a mere oblong, leather-
covered box. While there is one kind
of box-camera with a focussing de-
vice, it is now but seldom seen, the
usual kind, such as the "Brownie" and
"Buster Brown" having a fixed focus.
Films and not plates are used almost
exclusively in the box-camera. Its
work, although restricted to the field

of slow instantaneous exposures and
time exposures, is very good, and
there are two features which make for
it an important place in photography
—its extreme simplicity and its low
cost.
Folding comeras, hecause of their
broader adaptations, are far more com-
monly used both by professionals and
amateurs. They vary in size from the
little vest pocket camera, to the largest
hand cameras, taking pictures x
8J/2 inches, and view cameras, taking
pictures ii x 14 inches or even larger.
Many of the smaller sizes are of fixed
focus, in that whenever the bellows
is extended it is stopped automatically
at the hyperfocal distance. An exam-
ple of this is the "Vest Pocket Ko-

dak,' illustrated in figure 1. The "No.
o Graphic," shown in figure 2, while
not, strictly speaking, a folding cam-
era, may be considered in this connec-
tion because of its small size. It also
is a fixed focus camera. Figure 3 il-
lustrates a small camera, the "Goerz
Vest Pocket Tenax,'' which, on the
other hand, has a focussing device.
The focussing permits the photograph-
ing of objects closer to the camera
than possible with a fixed focus cam-
era, unless, in the case of the fixed
focus camera, an exceedingly small
aperture be used.
In the folding type are included
nearly all larger cameras. The larger
cameras have many adjustments not
possible with the smaller. A particu-
larly valuable adjustment is the rising
and falling , front, which, permits of
correcting distortion when high or de-
pressed objects are photographed. It
is impossible to photograph a high
building, without such an adjustment,
except from considerable distance,
without making the building appear
in the picture to taper toward the top.
For correcting extreme cases of dis-
tortion swing back or swing beds are
used. The swing or drop bed of a
"Cycle Graphic" is shown in figure 4.
The "Voigtlander Alpine" camera,
shown in figure 5, has a rising and
sliding front, manipulated by thumb
screws, and is also euipqped with trip-
le extension bed for nearby and repro-
ducing work. Additional refinements,
such as special short beds for wide an-
gle lenses,: and very long beds for tel-
ephoto and view work .are also used
cn many cameras.
The reflex type of camera, shown
in figure 6, was developed to meet the
focussing demands of the high speed
anastigmat lens. With the increase of
speed in these lenses there is decrease
in depth of focus, which renders diffi-
cult the usual method of focussing by
scale. In the reflex camera the image
projected by the lens is reflected by
a mirror to a fine ground glass screen
at the top of the camera, and the pro-
portions are so made that when the
picture is properly focussed on this
ground glass it will also focus on the
plate or film. When the operator has
his picture satisfactorily composed on
the screen, the simple pressing of a
button throws up the reflecting mir-
ror, and releases at the succeeding in-
stant the fast, focal-plane shutter. The
speed of these cameras, and their ac-
curacy in the hands of skilful opera-
tors, makes possible the photograph-
ing of rapid action and of scenes for
which there is but little time to pre-
pare. The section shown is that of a

"Graflex," so generally used by press
photographers for these purposes. Fig-
ure 7 shows another type of reflex
camera, the "Goerz Folding Reflex."
A fourth distinct type of camera is
the panoram, designed for photo-
graphing large groups and extended
landscapes. Two methods are used in
operating these. In the panoram Ko-
dak the camera remains stationary
during exposure, while the lens re-
volves uniformly about a pivot
through its optical center, projecting
the image on successive portions of a
long film. The film, in order to have
the focal distance from the lens cor-
rect throughout its length, is held on
the inside surface of a cylinder, the
axis of which coincides with the axis
of rotation of the lens. With these
cameras the maximum angle of view
must be always less than 180 degrees,
and is usually less than 145 degrees.
The second principle is used in the
"Cirkut" camera. In this the whole
camera turns slowly on a pivot, while
the film turns at the same speed in the
opposite direction, so keeping the im-
age on any portion of the field station&gt;-
ary. With a camera of this type it is
possible to "close the horizon," and
such cameras are made in sizes per-
mitting of pictures as large as 16
inches x 18 feet.
There are studio and process cam-
eras, and mimerous special designs
with features adapting them to cer-
tain narrow fields of work, but the
last type of camera that need be de-
scribed is the stereoscopic, which is
nothing more than a folding camera
designed for taking two pictures at
once on the stereoscopic principle. For
this purpose it usually has two lenses
and, in some cases, two shutters.
• That a photograph depends entirely
on the lens would obviously be no
more a correct statement than that it
depends on the shutter, the plate or
the printing paper, but certainly the
importance of the lens cannot be over-
estimated. Without a good lens all re-
finements of plates, shutters and cam-
eras are of little value. As a discus-
sion of photographic lenses, other than
the most elementary of them, leads
into very involved optics, lenses can
here be considered only in a very gen-
eral way.
The simplest lens used in photog-
raphy is the meniscus or concavo-con-
vex. It is found in the cheaper box
and folding cameras. Meniscus lenses
give a true image only in the center of
the plate or film, and that only when
a comparatively small aperture is used.
The maximum speed at which they
will work is f-H, and many of them
f-16.
The speed of a lens is determined
by the amount of light it will allow to
fall upon the plate or film in forming
the image. This amount is determined
by the size of aperture and focal
length of the lens. The quotient ob-
tained by dividing the focal length of
the lens by the diameter of the great-
est effective aperture at which it will
cut clean is the measure of its speed,
and is represented by prefixing that
quotient with the letter "f." The sym-
bol f-16 means that the focal length
of the lens divided by the largest ef-
fective aperture at which it will work
is equal to 16. To obtain greater
speed, then, the ratio of the aperture,
or diaphram, to the focal distance
must be increased, and the f-value so
decreased. As soon as, in an effort
to accomplish this, the size of dia-
phram is increased, the problem of
correcting the lens becomes involved
and difficult.
The rapid rectilinear lens, now
widely used in medium priced cam-
eras, solves the problem to the extent
that a diaphram, aperture or stop as
large as f-8 is completely corrected
for in most respects. Astigmatism,
however, the chief foe to good defini-
tion, is not corrected for. Lenses af-
flicted with astigmatism will never
show both horizontal and vertical lines
sharply defined at the same time and


9
this is the fault of the rapid rectilin-
ear.
All attempts to correct for astigma-
tism were futile until a new glass,
manufactured at Jena, was introduced.
With the new glass it was found pos-
sible to correct for it completely, and
the modern anastigmat lens is the re-
sult. These lenses are now manufac-
tured in numberless forms with speeds
ranging from the very rapid f-3.5 in
portrait and cinematograph lenses, to
f-11 and even slower in wide-angle
anastigmats. Other matters for which
the anastigmats are completely or al-
most completely corrected are chro-
matic aberration, coma aberration, dis-
tortion, and spherical aberration. If
not corrected for in making a lens,
chromatic aberration causes the lines
between objects of certain different
colors, as yellow and blue, to be blur-
red in the picture; coma aberration in-
terferes with the distinctness of all
outlines of objects; distortion causes
straight lines, such as those of a side-
walk, running diagonally across the
picture, to appear curved; and spheri-
cal aberration causes zones and rude
circles of indistinctness in the picture.
With the greater speed of anastig-
mats came the necessary decrease in
"depth of field," which was met, as
has been said, by the invention of the
reflex camera. In justice to the an-
astigmats it should be said that depth
of field, or depth of focus, is entirely
independent of the kind of lens, and
that when stopped down the anastig-
mat will show the same depth as any
of the lenses described having the
same focal length and same size of ef-
fective aperture.
There is a type of anastigmat,
known as the convertible, which de-
serves special attention. It consists of
two lens cells, each a perfect anastig-
mat in itself, but so designed that they
may be used in combination, forming
a new anastigmat of a new focal
length—a point of great value to some
photographers.
The wide angle lens is one used for
working in interiors and confined
quarters. It is merely a lens of short
focal length, and so designed as to
cover a large plate. One of the most
remarkable of these is the "Goerz Hy-
pergon," which includes an angle of
135 degrees.
There are three conditions deter-
mining the size of a photographic im-
age cast by a lens, (1) size of the ob-
ject itself, (2) its distance from the
lens, and (3) the focal length of the
lens ewployed. The size of the object
is obviously unalterable, and in many
case the distance is also. Take, for
instance, the case of a mountain fifty
miles away. As long-focus positive
lenses, which would throw a larger
image of such a distant mountain on
the plate, or, in effect, "bring it near-
er," are both expensive and in many
ways difficult to use, a photographic
telescope or telephoto lens has been
developed.
Such lenses are now obtainable in
sizes to fit nearly all regular camera
lenses. They consist essentially of a
negative lens of comparatively short
focal length, fitted into a tube, so that
it may te mounted in front of the reg-
ular positive lens of the camera. This
negative lens, combined with the pos-
itive lens, has the effect of greatly in-
creasing the apparent focal length,
without requiring a corresponding in-
crease in bellows draw of the camera.
With such lenses it is possible to se-
cure magnifications up to ten diame-
ters or even more, although with high
magnifications, since the exposure re-
quired increases as the square of the
magnification, such exposure may
have to be unduly long. In other
words if the telephoto apparatus mag-
nified the size of picture taken by the
regular lens of the camera ten times,
the length of exposure would have to
be ten squared, or 100 times, longer.
To keep pace with the advances in
lens design, and especially with the in-
crease of speed gained by the anastig-
mat. manufacturers and inventors of
shutters have been kept very busy,

and the results they have achieved are
truly marvelous. Not long ago a shut-
ter working in 1-25 of a second was
considered very rapid. Now shutters
working in 1-1000 of a second, which
is rapid enough to catch a speeding
express train, are common.
J11 small box-cameras the rotary
shutter, giving instantaneous expos-
ures of about 1-40 of a second and
time exposures of any length, is much

used. It consists of a circular disc
with an oblong hole cut near its cir-
cumference, so that when revolved
about its axis by a steel spring, the
hole passes in front of the lens and
admits light to the cajnera. The du-
ration of the exposure is dependent
on the length of the hr&gt;le and the speed
at which the disc is revolved. This
shutter is not very efficient, because
♦luring a large part of the exposure it
is either opening or closing, and more-
over, from the way the hole must be
cut in the disc, the exposure is slightly
unsymmetrical.
In the automatic shutter these points
of inefficiency are largely eliminated,
and exposures down to 1-1000 of a
second are made possible. The open-
ing is closed, in this shutter, by sev-
eral leaves of segments, placed so as
to open and close for exposure in the
shape of a star. The ''Kodak Ball
Bearing Shutter," shown in figure 8,
belongs to this class.
A still more efficient shutter is the
"Compound," shown in figure 9, which
permits exposures as short as 1-250
of a second. Before exposure the
shutter must be set; that is the en-
ergy for operating must be given by
setting a spring before the release is
pressed.
Shutters of both the automatic and
compound types include, as an inte-
gral part, an iris diaphram for "stop-
ping down" the lens to any desired
aperture. In the case of the "Volute
Shutter," not illustrated here, this dia-
FIG. 9. COMPOUND SHUTTER.
phram utilises the same leaves which
open and close to make the shutter ex-
posure, thus saving the undesirable
necessity of having the shutter and
diaphram in different planes.
The most efficient shutter, with the
porsible exception of the "multi-
speed," is the focal-plane shutter. It
consists of a light-proof curtain con-
taining a slot of adjustable width,
which moves directly across the face of
the plate or film while the lens remains
constantly open. The slot in the cur-
lain makes the exposure in passing
over, and the amount of the exposure
depends on the width of the slot
and the speed at which it moves.
While other types of shutter spend
considerable amount of the exposure
opening and closing, in the case of the
focal-plane the lens is wide open all
through the exposre, and there is a
great resultant gain in efficiency. So
great is this gain that exposures of
1-1000 to 1-1500 of a second are pos-
sible with erood anastigmat lenses in
sunlight. With nearly all focal-plane
shutters automatic speeds as low as


II
l-io of a second are arranged for, and
in the "Goerz Ango" shutter auto-
matic exposures as low as five seconds,
which gives a broad range of speed.
Matters of cameras, lenses and shut-
ters fall within what may be called the
mechanical phase of photography.
While proper minds have been work-
ing upon them, however, that of the
•chemist has been at work upon the
preparation of plates, films and print-
ing papers. Plates and films may now
be had in fast, medium or slow emul-
sions; for contrasty or soft effects;
uncorrected for color, chromatically
balanced (orthochromatic), or red
sensitive (panchromatic); and so on
in great variety. Plates uncorrected
for color can be used successfully only
in photographing black and white ob-
jects, such as other photographs, and
for that reason are usually employed
only in reproducing work. Orthochro-
matic plates are those most commonly
used, and are so corrected, chemically
and physically, that they represent yel-
low and blue in the same relative
brightness with which those colors
strike the eye. The uncorrected plate
would show, in a print made from it,
blue as white, and yellow as a very
dark gray. The panchromatic plate
is corrected a step further, being made
to represent red in its true value rela-
tive to other colors, which even the
orthochromatic plate will not do. In
the ordinary print made from the or-
thochromatic plate red objects appear
as black or very dark objects. The un-
corrected and orthochroiratic plates
are insensitive to pure red light, which
is the reason they can be developed in
the so-called dark-room with a ruby
lamp. The panchromatic plate must
be developed in utter darkness, be-
cause it is rendered sensitive to even
this ruby light.
Important among new varieties of
plates are the non-halation, which is
sometimes double coated and some-
times backed to prevent halation when
photographing toward a strong light,
and the "Hydra" plate, which yields
good negatives even when an expos-
ure many times that required has been
made.
As to the relative quality of work
done with plates and films there is but
little difference. Films have the ad-
vantage in the fact of their lesser
weight and bulk. The roll films are
more easily developed by daylight
method than plates. On the other
hand plates permit the use, at each in-
dividual exposure, of the plate best
suited to the subject in hand and the
conditions, while films permit the use
of only one single emulsion while the
pack or roll is in the camera. Plates
also lend themselves more readily to
individual treatment in developing, al-
though this point is of little value ex-
cept, occasionally, to expert workers.
Several plates now on the market,
among which are the "Autochrome."
"Dufayy' "Thames," and "Omnico-
lore," take photographs in colors.
These plates will be fully described
in a later article to appear in The
Technic, on "Color Photography.'
Even more varied than the plates
and films, however, are the printing
papers and methods of development,
now in use. Fsesides the many pre-
pared papers there are several, such as
the gum-bichromate, which the work-
er prepares himself. The prepared
papers are generally classified as "day-
light" and "gaslight" papers, the for-
mer requiring daylight to print in, the
latter sufficiently sensitive that arti-
ficial light can be used.
Most familiar of the so-called day-
light papers is probably the ferro-
prussiate or blue print paper, so much
used in producing drawings. More
commonly used by the photographers,
however, are the printing-out papers,
of which "Solio" is a fair sample, de-
riving their name from the fact that,
in contradistinction to the developing-
out papers, the image appears as rap-
idly as the light affects the paper. In
the latter papers the image appears
only after the paper, which has been
exposed to the light, has been placed


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC.
in a certain chemical bath. Several
papers such as "Solio" require toning
to a desirable color after printing. In
some the toning is done by chemicals
contained in the emulsion, but usually
it must be dene in separate gold or
platinum baths. The paper is then
"fixed" in a bath of sodium thiosul-
fate (hypo), or sometimes the toning
and fixing chemicals are placed in one
bath and both processes carried on at
the s?.me time. Platinum papers and
kallitypes—papers sensitised with iron
salts-—also show the image upon print-
ing, but unlike "Solio" paper, require
a process of developing and not of
toning.
Among the daylight papers in which
the image does not appear upon print-
ing are the gum bichromate papers
and prints made by the carbon process.
The emulsion of a "gum" print con-
sists of gum arabic sensitised with
potassium bichromate, and carrying
a suitable coloring pigment. The print
is developed by dissolving away the
unexposed1 portions of the print with
water.
In the carbon process, which is prob-
ably the most permanent of all, a spec-
ial carbon tissue is sensitised with
some sensitiser, as a potassium bichro-
mate solution, and printed. The tissue
is then transferred to a support, and
developed with water like a "gum"
print.
Gaslight papers are more generally
used than daylight papers, because
they are easy to manipulate, and the
worker is entirely independent of day-
light. "Velox", "Azo", "Cyko" and
many other papers comin? in this class
are so common as to hardly need men-
tion. For enlarging prposes and for
making contact prints where an ex-
ceedingly fast emulsion is required,
bromide papers are often used.
They are used also as the basis for
prints in the ozobrome and bromoil
processes, but almost exclusively by
professionals and advanced workers.
In addition to these classes of pa-
pers a new one has recently been in-
vented, called the "Utocolore", for
tcking color prints from color nega-
tives.
While space will not permit even the
most elementary discussion of nega-
tive making and printing, there is an
argument in favor of the tank or time
method of development which should
rot be omitted. This is well present-
ed in Burroughs Wellcome Com-
pany's trade booklet, "Self Help in
Photography":
"The best method, on the whole, is
that which may be described as time
development. It may be applied to
plates or films, and may be carried out
with ordinary dishes, or with special
tanks supplied by all dealers for glass
plates or roll films. The advantages
of time development are that it gives
perfectly uniform negatives when the
exposures have been correct. It
brings evertbing out that can be got
out of an under-exposed plate, and
removes the temptation to over-devel-
op in hope that more detail may be
obtained. It gives the best results
which can be obtained with over-ex-
posed plates, and prevents any risk of
fog which may be caused by the diffi-
culty of determining when develop-
ment is complete, and is adjustable to
any plate and to the production of
negatives suitable for any printing
process. Nothing more could be de-
manded, and no other system offers
so much."
This argument is good. If greater
or less density of negative is required
it may be secured by reduction or in-
tensification after development. The
argument that the dark room permits
of individual treatment of each nega-
tive is not well taken, for unless the
worker has advanced far beyond the
stage of "most amateurs and the ma-
jority of professional photographers
he is rarely able to improve on the
work done by the time method.
When the time method is used, too-
much stress cannot be laid on the im-
portance of uniform chemicals and


13
exact weights. In most cases it will
"be found advantageous to use the
standard developers with known con-
stants for temperature correction.
Such are the "Tabloid" developers of
the Burroughs Wellcome Company,
and the tank developers put out by the
Eastman Kodak Company.
While but few phasesof photography
have here been touched upon and they
but superficially, this article may serve
as an introduction to special subjects

THE VALUE OF MODERN LANGUAGES TO
THE ENGINEER
BY HERBERT A. KEN YON, M.A.
NO SUBJECT, perhaps in the
curriculum of the engineering
school appeals so little to the
average student as that of modern
languages. He sees in the study of
French, German or Spanish only a
waste of time which might be devoted
to other subjects apparently more
closely associated with his future line
of work. He believes that more
mathematics, problems or lectures
dealing with the technical side of his
chosen profession, are of greater im-
portance. Modern language, however,
if taught with a view to making it
practical, is almost indispensable to
engineers.
In the first place, it is of much cul-
tural value to the engineer. To say
nothing of the disciplinary value of
the study of formal grammar which it
involves, modern language study
opens up new fields of thought, new
types of expression, new realms of
history and tradition, and new atti-
tudes toward all problems of life.
With an interesting teacher a course
in modern language can be made al-
most as interesting as actual travel,
and will awaken in the student a
healthy curiosity regarding the cus-
toms, habits, interests and intellectual
and social advancement of foreign
peoples. It not only enables the stu-
dent with literary tastes to enjoy and
profit by a study of master minds of
other lands, but leads anyone to un-
derstand -and appreciate the points of
view of those master minds without
the intermediary of that poor counter-
feit, a translation.
"Rut," you will say, "this is all very
well for the broadening side of an en-
gineer's education; what about the
practical side? Is that as great as we
have been led to believe?''
It can be laid down as a fact that
no engineer w-ho is content with what
he has learned in college will ever
climb very high on the ladder of his
profession. College work is but a
preparation for the real work of the
engineer. The knowledge gained by
it is to be constantly supplemented by
practical experience, by contact with
men of practical achievement, and&gt;
where contact is impossible, by read-
ing of such men and their achieve-
ments in books and papers.
No one would assert that all the ad-
vance in modern science and the pro-
fessions based upon it is being made
in America and England. In Ger-
many and France keen scientific and
professional men are constantly en-
gaged in research in every field. The
results are published in their own lan-
guages, and then in the scientific jour-
nals and books of their own countries.
Scientific articles published abroad
outnumber ours seven to one. Also
more scientific and technical books are
published abroad. And in few cases
are translations made of either the
foreign articles or books, because the
small sale for the translations would
not pay for the work they require and
the publisher's expense.
The vale of such books to one who
can use them is illustrated by a specific
case from personal experience: A
man who had felt particularly grieved,
as a student, over being compelled to
study French, and had, accordingly,
studied it as little as possible, found
himself, two years after graduation,
doing experimental work based on the
researches of a French engineer. He
then came to me many* times for as-
sistance, and often bewailed the time
he was forced to lose through his
faulty understanding of the text. He
said he would like to warn every en-
gineering student against slighting his


15
language work, for he was sure to
need foreign language when least ex-
pected. This is only one of many sim-
ilar cases.
The electrical mechanical and chem-
ical engineers have great need for both
French and German, while the archi-
tect is sure to find them absolutely in-
dispensable. Professors are often
heard to say that they cannot assign
certain important books and articles,
because some members of the class
cannot read the French and German
in which they are written. The whole
class is thereby held off from valua-
ble educational assets.
From the financial side a modern
langage is likely to prove of great val-
ue, particularly to the civil engineer.
This is especially true of Spanish. Our
South American trade is increasing by
leaps and bounds. For many years
Germany has had the most of it be-
cause she pent out to obtain it men
who knew Spanish. The United States
is now awakening to the trade slip-
ping by its very doors, and translating
bureaus are doing a flourishing busi-
ness because American manufacturers
cannot find enough men with both
technical education and a knowledge
of Spanish.
Only a few days ago I had a letter
from a former graduate of the Uni-
versity of Michigan who is connected
with one' of the large bridge compa-
nies. He is doing their Spanish trans-
lation as a part of his work. He'states
that the South American business is
rapidly increasing, and that, on the
strength of his Spanish, he expects
before long to be given a responsible
position in connection with it. Every
now and then we bear of flattering
offers, in just such cases, to men, even'
with little experience, who have a
command of Spanish.
Some will make an objection that a
student does not get enough of any
one language, during his college ca-
reer, to be of use to him. In many
cases this is a perfectly true criticism,
but will hardly apply in the case at
Michigan. Under the requirements
here a student must have at least two
years of any one language. In both
French and German this includes sim-
ple scientific reading in the first se-
mester, technical reading from books
and journals in the second semester,
of the second year. Special courses
are arranged for more advanced stu-
dents. In Spanish the emphasis is laid
rather on the commercial and spoken
sides. A student is thus enabled to get
a fair working knowledge of any lan-
guage or languages that he takes up.
Should he not use a language imme^
diately after graduation and grow
hazy on it, still with a very little study
he will again have it completely in
hand.
In years after his graduation, even
though an engineer acquire the incli-
nation, he will be unable to learn a
foreign language from the beginning
because of lack of time. Its study, as
a fundamental preparation of the en-
gineer, must be pursued in the univer-
sity or technical school. It is one of
those things which will never be done
if put off.
Yet another use which an engineer
may find for his knowledge of a mod-
ern language, occurs in case he goes
abroad for weeks or months for study
and research. All the papers he reads
are foreign; all the people he talks to
are foreign. The language is then
indispensable, and what a loss of time
if he must stop to learn it!
Wcrk in engineering, as in science,
is progressing at startling rate, and
demanding more and more of its fol-
lowers. A great discovery today may
he superseded by a greater one tomor-
row. The engineer in any branch of
the profession must be a research man,
and as such must have at his disposal
as many research tools as posible. One
of the greatest of such tools is a thor-
ough knowledge of one or more mod-
ern languages. And again, with the
venturing into South America, our is-
land possessions, Cuba and Mexico, of
American engineers, a new demand
arises for their education in the lan-
guage of those parts of the world.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC.
MICHIGAN MEN
The field of engineer-
prof. henry ing has broadened so
earle riggs much in the last twen-
ty years, that it is no
longer possible to say just what it in-
cludes or excludes. It has no hard and
fast line of limitation, nor yet are the
lines of division between its various
branches quite distinct. This is a con-
dition which has had to be met, in the
education of the young engineer, by
drafting into the university, as teach-
ers, men of high professional stand-
ing from the world without. Such
men alone are capable of giving use-
ful instruction in theory, and demon-
strating, by live examples from the
field, how and where theories apply in
practice. They have come to possess,
moreover, through the ups and downs
of their experience, a keener and
wanner sympathy for the student in
the profession.
The services of such men from the
outside world are, of course, hard to
obtain. But Michigan has succeeded in
obtaining them in the past. That she
has again succeeded is proved by the
professional record back of Professor
Riggs, and by the universal favor and
enthusiasm with which he has been
met since, last spring, he became head
of the Department of Civil Engineer-
ing.
Henry Earle Riggs was born in
Kansas in 1865. He graduated from
Kansas University in 1886. Soon af-
terward he joined the engineering
staff of the Santa Fe Railroad,and held
various important positions on it until
1890. In 1896 he entered general prac-
tice, with headquarters at Toledo,
Ohio, and was, for the major part of
the period from 1896 to 1912 senior
member of the firm of Riggs &amp; Sher-
man, whose specialty was municipal
problems, and whose activities extend-
ed throughout several states. Riggs
&amp; Sherman built highways, paved
streets, constructed water works, sew-
ers and sewage disposal plants, and
steam and electric railways.
Only after reaching the top of his
profession did Mr. Riggs receive, in
1910, the formal degree of Civil En-
gineer from the University of Mich-
igan. He was already a member of
the American Society of Civil Engi-
neers, and during the years previous
had contributed to it several of the
most noteworthy articles that have ap-
peared in the Engineering papers of a
decade. He is Past President of the
Michigan Engineering Society, and
still takes an active interest in its wel-
fare.
The specialty of Professor Riggs
for the last several years has been the
evaluation of railroad, water-power,
and similar property of public service
corporations, a field of growing im-
portance. In it he has risen to a posi-
tion of leadership, and his public re-
ports, available to all, are becoming
objects of study.
That he possesses that sympathy
for people and their institutions which
go to make one a man and a citizen as
well as an engineer, is best appreciat-
ed by reading some of his articles. The
following is an extract from one of
them:
"* * * There is probably no more
loyal body of men in the world today
than the officials and employees of
railroads. Their loyalty, however, is
all to 'our company.' They enter its
service as boys or young men; they
grow up to the full strength of man-
hood working for its good; they take
little or no part in public affairs; they
have no time for the study of public
questions. Their friends are almost
exclusively among their own asso-
ciates in the service of the road, and
their development is along the lines
of their own special work in the ser-
vice. As a body of honest, honorable
and worthy men, absolutely loyal to
their employers, they have few equals;


*7
but it is doubtful if any equal number
of men, of equal intelligence, have so
limited a knowledge of the fundamen-
tal truths of government, or knowl-
edge so colored by bias. It is also
doubtful whether any equal number of
men have in their ranks so few who
bear an active part in the duties and
activities of citizenship, or who exer-
cise large influence on their neigh-
bors."
This analysis and appreciation of his
former associates, explains in part
what it is that gives Professor Riggs
his full-rounded personality—the per-
sonality which fits him to inspire, and
not alone instruct, the embryo engi-
neer to the noblest as well as the most
vigorous efforts in his chosen profes-
sion.

DEPARTMENTAL NOTES
Camp Davis, home of
summer camp the summer school
improvements surveying classes on
Douglas Lake, dur-
ing the last summer received sev-
eral improvements. First in impor-
tance is probably the new harbor. It
consists of a basin 30 x 65 feet, 50 feet
back from the shore of the lake, con-
nected with the lake by a channel IQ
feet wide. The sides of the basin and
channel are kept from caving in by
log cribs. Previous to the making of
this harbor the boats of the camp had
to be kept between two log booms,
anchored out from the shore of the
lake, which was a very unsatisfactory
arrangement, as in high north winds
the anchors often gave way, and the
boats had to be rescued, whatever time
of the day or night it might be. The
harbor was dedicated early in July
with fitting ceremonies.
The camp has a good well located
near the mess tent at the top of a hill,
and a second improvement consisted
of installing a cistern, of 30 barrels
capacity, near it and piping downward
along State street a distance of 600
feet. A pressure of nearly thirty
pounds to the scjuare inch is obtained,
which makes a very efficient water sys-
tem. The water in the well seems
practically inexhaustible, and the cis-
tern is filled from it, by pumping, as
often as necessary.
A third important addition to the
camp is a concrete building 15x30
feet, which will be used as a dark
room and instrument room in summer,
and a store house during the winter.
It is large enough to contain all the
camp furniture and tents.
Yet another is a concrete platform,
20 x 30 feet, covered with canvas, for
use in adjusting instruments in stonily
weather. This was christened "The
Michigan Union." The concrete con-
tains at one end, in large block let-
ters, "M. U.," and at the other,
"19E13," numerals of the class which
did the christening.
Students and teaching staff alike-
joined in all the construction work,
which, for many, afforded some val-
uable experience.
In providing for
the debating meetings at wdiich the
sections student of the depart-
ment may develop the
ability to speak before an adience, and
to think when on his feet, the engi-
neering society is performing a need-
ed work. Owing to the fact that the
regular English class sections are so
large, and that there is so much pre-
liminary work to be done, it is impos-
sible to give training in public speak-
ing in the prescribed four hours of
English. These debating sections, in
accordance, give the student an op-
portunity to train himself to present
his thoughts to an audience in a clear,
logical way, as an engineer is so often
called upon to do before city councils,
corporation directorates, and other
bodies.
Two regular meetings are being held
weekly this year, and a closer relation
has also been established with the
English department, whereby the de-
baters receive criticism and instruc-
tion in the composition of their speech-
es from a member of the faculty. The
sections are self-governing, however,
and a good feature is that the men in
them are unhampered by class regu-
lations or prejudices.
MICHIGAN'S
WIRELESS
STATION
The wireless tele-
graph station used in
the Department of
Electrical Engineer-
ing at the University of Michigan, for
purposes of class demonstration and
experimentation, has a sending capac-
ity, under favorable conditions, of
over 1,500 miles, which exceeds the
capacity of most of the commercial


19
stations operated on the seacoast and
the great lakes. Frequently has this
station relayed messages, out of cour-
tesy, for the station in Detroit, when
the latter found difficulty in hearing
them. Numerous messages have been
sent by Dean Cooley, of the Depart-
ment, to Washington and Annapolis.
A recent message proving the capacity
of the plant was sent direct to the
steamer "Metapan,' on the Atlantic,
850 miles out of New York.
Professor R. D. Parker, who gives
the course in wireless, and is in charge
of the University station, is now work-
ing on an article on the subject of
wireless telegraphy for the next issue
of The Technic. He proposes to
bring out in this the great strides
which have been made, toward the
perfection of this new form of com-
munication, and the problems which
are met with in sending and receiving
messages and in constructing stations.
Even electrical engineers, both in
training and practice, lack and under-
standing of this subject, and his aim
is to so elucidate all technical phases
that they may be generally understood
by anyone.
A new type of elec-
A new electric trie locomotive, com-
locomotive bining the advantages
of the three-phase in-
duction motor with those of a single-
phase overhead contact, has been
worked out by Professor C. L. de
Muralt during the last two years, and
the General Electric Company, at
whose plant he completed his plans
the past summer, is now building a
ifio ton machine of the kind for the
Great Northern Railway.
The single-phase locomotive was
excessively heavy and inefficient, so
that on the roads where it was adopted
it has been, in most cases, taken out
after a few years' trial. The three-
phase induction motor is acknowl-
edged to be not only of much greater
efficiency, but the most robust motor
built. The problem has been to use
ARTESIAN
WELLS
this motor with a single-phase contact
line which is the simplest possible, and
can be used at the highest pressures.
Most of Professor deMuralt's work
on the problem was done in the elec-
trical laboratory of the University.
The success of the new locomotive
will be undoubted if it does the work
laid out for it, as it will be used on
the Cascade division of the Great
Northern in the severest kind of
heavy-grade, mountain service.
The City of Ann Ar-
tests on ]:or js conducting a
test on five artesian
wells, located on the
Steere farm, four miles south, to de-
termine whether or not their natural
How is uniform and of sufficient
amount to supply the city with water.
The natural flow is being measured
by means of a weir at each well. After
this test of flow has been completed,
machinery will be installed, and the
amount of water available by pumping
determined. The wells are eight inches
in diameter and thirty-five to forty
feet deep. Manly Osgood, '11E, City
Engineer, has charge of the tests, and
is assisted.by two senior students from
the engineering department of the
University.
The civil engineering
WATER AND faclutv Df tne Uni-
SEWAGE , ,
experiment versity has made
plans for the con-
struction of an experiment station for
water and sewage purification on the
Huron River in Ann Arbor. When the
plans are fully carried out this will be
the most complete of any station in
this country excepting that of the state
Board of Health of Massachusetts.
Two objects will be aimed at, first, to
show, in working order, the most re-
liable and efficient processes of water
and sewage purification used in both
this and foreign countries; second, to
extend knowledge along this line, and
more particularly to study methods
used in other countries with a view
^o adopting them here.

Machinery the same as that used in
the Office of Public Roads in the De-
partment of Agriculture, at Washing-
ton, for testing road and paving ma-
terials, has been installed in the civil
engineering laboratory. One of the
machines is the latest model of rattler
for testing paving brick. All the ma-
chinery is open to the use of everyone
in the state, upon the payment of a
nominal fee.
Arrangements have been made with
the State Highway Commission for
testing road and paving materials at
the University. The testing of paving
brick, stone, cement, macadam and
similar materials will be in charge of
Professor E. D. Rich, of the Depart-
ment of Civil Engineering, while the
testing of bituminous materials, such
as asphalt, tar, etc., will be in charge
of Professor White, of the Depart-
ment of Chemical Engineering.
An electric lighting, starting and ig-
nition device for automobiles has been
perfected, after a year and a half of
work on the design, by Prof. B. F.
Uailey, and a company, known as the
Bailey Electric Co., has been organ-
ized to operate under his patents at
Grand Rapids. About 10,000 outfits
will be manufactured the coming year.
W. M. Rennie, '12E, is the resident
engineer of the company at Grand
Rapids.
Dean Cooley has been asked by the
State Railway Commission to make an
evaluation of the Grand Rapids street
railways. The details will be under the
direction of Prof. Riggs and Prof.
Anderson.
Tests have been completed in the
electrical engineering laboratory on
fourteen different types of magnetos
with a view to determining their rel-
ative efficiencies, igniting power, etc.

The Technic ap-
the new pears this year, for
technic the first time in its
history, as a monthly
publication. This is more than the
most sanguine of former boards has
ever dared hope for or attempt, and
yet the new board undertakes the pro-
ject with a feeling of confidence born
of an efficient reorganization.
The Technic of former years was
handicapped both at the editorial and
business ends. The editorial staff al-
ways had a wealth of material to draw
from for publication, and appreciated
the opportunites before it in this di-
rection. But the members of the staff
received no compensation for what
they did. and to find time for more
work than that necessary to the pub-
lication of a semi-annual was impos-
sible. The difficulty has now been
eliminated by the Engineering Fac-
ulty consenting to give credit toward
graduation to students displaying ap-
plication and meritorious work on the
staff.
The business management, on the
other hand, formerly faced the Hercu-
lean task of financing a publication
with a free circulation, and a circu-
lation, at that, so small as to offer
scant attraction to advertisers. The
semi-annual character of the magazine
also hurt the advertising. Practically
the only source of revenue was then
the membership dues of the Engineer-
ing Society which published and still
publishes The Technic.
Having made monthly publication
possible, the Faculty comes again to
the rescue by making the magazine a
sub-text-book in the first year Eng-
lish classes, and so increasing its cir-
culation. Roth of these changes mean
much tr&gt; the business management.
Another recent act of the Faculty,
however, which means much to the
Technic, has been the appointment of
an advisor from the Engineering De-
partment cf English, the duty of whom
will be editing of copy, and the super-
vision and criticism of the work of the
staff. With the splendid outlay of
material, therefore, which can be
brought together from faculty, stu-
dent and alumni sources, subscribers
will be assured, in future issues, of
worthy subjects properly written and
edited.
Following is the plan of reorgani-
zation agreed upon by Faculty and
Engineering Society. This includes
all the revisions to Article 5 of the
Constitution of the Engineering So-
ciety which the new scheme of reor-
ganization entails. A complete copy
of the amended Constitution and By-
laws will appear in the January issue
of The Technic:

WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY
BY PROFESSOR R. U. PARKED.
THE WORD telegraph means "to
write far off" or, more general-
ly, "to communicate by sig-
nals." in wire telegraphy this is per-
formed by connecting a wire between
the distant points and using the wire
to direct a current of electricity. In
wireless telegraphy the connecting
wire is eliminated and, properly speak-
ing, wireless telegraphy antedates wire
telegraphy thousands 'of years, for
smoke signals, light flashes, semaphor-
es, wig-wag systems are wireless
means of communication almost as
old as man. Modern theory teaches
us that in each the signal was trans-
mitted by electrical action in which the
eye was the electrical detecting instru-
ment.
Modern wireless systems eclipse all
of the earlier attempts in their ease
and speed of operation, and in the
enormous distances which they cover.
Smoke signals in daylight, and light
flashes at night transmitted at their
best, only a few miles, and the trans-
mission of a complete message was a
laborious process. Today thousands
of miles are covered, day or night, at
speeds of 20 to 40 words per minute.
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT
After Morse invented the electro-
magnetic telegraph in the thirties, in-
ventors and scientists endeavored to
apply the then known principles of
electricity and magnetism to the prob-
lem of wireless telegraphy. Thus
Morse himself, in 1842, attempted to
telegraph across a narrow canal by
conduction through the water. This
was successful and the method was
applied for telegraphing across
streams in many parts of the world.
In 1882 the late Professor Dolbear, of
Tufts College, who was a graduate of
our Engineering Department of the
class of 1867, obtained a patent for a
system of wireless telegraphy based
upon electrostatic induction between
elevated conductors. Also in the eight-
ies Edison and Phelps experimented
with wireless telegraphy between mov-
ing trains and stations, using either
electromagnetic or electrostatic induc-
tion between wires carried by the cars
and wires carried on poles along the
right of way. In 1898 Sir William
Preece, engineer for the British Post
Office, established a regular wireless
outfit, based upon electromagnetic in-
duction between parallel wires, for
communication across the Bristol
Channel. But all of these systems
failed for distances over 5 or 10 miles.
These were all attempts of practical
men to solve a problem which was too
deep for them. It required the highly
theoretical man working without hope
of monetary reward to point out the
way to real success.
In 1865 James Clark Maxwell, Pro-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC.
fessor of Experimental Physics at
Cambridge University, gave the world
an electromagnetic wave theory of
light which he obtained by mathemat-
ical reasoning based upon earlier ex-
periments. This mathematical theory
was away over the heads of contemp-
orary physicists and experimenters. It
was not until the eighties that Hein-
rich Hertz, a young Professor of
Physics at the University of Bonn,
confirmed this theory by experiments
wherein he actually produced non-vis-
ible electromagnetic waves, showed
that they had practically all the char-
acteristics of ordinary light waves, and
caused them to produce electric sparks
at a distance. The production of elec-
tric sparks at a distance immediately
caught the attention of men interested
in telegraphy. Hertz published his par
pers in the late eighties and for the
next 6 or 7 years several investigators
tried to extend the range of these
waves for telegraph purposes, though
none apparently succeeded in trans-
mitting signals over a few hundred
feet. In 1895 Guglielmo Marconi,
then only 21 years old, began experi-
menting with such waves on his fath-
er's estate near Bologna, in Italy. In
that year he transmitted signals 1 1-2
miles in all directions. In 1896 he
went to England, and in 1897 obtained
his first British patent. From that time
dates the engineering and commercial
development of wireless telegraphy or,
better, radio telegraphy, since it de-
pends on the use of electromagnetic
waves.
THE HERTZ OSCILLATOR
From the above it is apparent that
some knowledge of electromagnetic
waves is necessary before one can un-
derstand very much about modem
wireless telegraphy. Hertz produced
these waves by an electric oscillator
which is shown in Fig. 1. It consists
of two insulated metallic bodies A and
B tipped with balls and symmetrical
about the axes X-X and Y-Y. Imagine
these bodies to be charged as indicat-
ed. It is then found that the surround-
ing space is in a peculiar condition
since light positively or negatively
charged bodies move in certain direc-
tions. Thus a small positively charg-
ed body placed at d will move( to /
along the path def. This region is
called an electric field; the path of the
charged body is called a line of the
field, and it is necessary to expend
energy or do work to produce this
field. It represents a certain amount
of energy.
Now imagine that A and B approach
each other until a spark is noticed in
the space C. This spark indicates an
electric current, and any electric cur-
rent produces a magnetic field, a region
in which magnetic poles are affected.
The strength of this magnetic field is
proportional to the current flowing in
and between the two parts A and B of
the oscillator. A single magnetic pole
placed in this field will describe a cir-
cle about the axis Y-Y of the oscillat-
or which path is called a line of the
field. This magnetic field also requires
energy for its production, and in this
case the energy of the magnetic field
comes from the electric field. There-
fore, as the magnetic field appears the
electric field disappears, and the mag-
netic field is a maximum when the elec-
tric field is zero. On the other hand,
if the magnetic field decreases the elec-
tric field increases. The two fields are
mutually dependent.
But it must not be thought that
these transformations take place in-
stantly; it takes time to perform any
operation. To have a better under-
standing of the possible time relations
therefore let us once more consider
the current flow between the parts of
the oscillator. The visible spark pro-
duced when a current flows in the
space C is really made up of a number
of sparks coming so very close togeth-
er that it is impossible to distinguish
the intervals between them. The op-
eration, ideally considered, is as fol-
lows: For a short interval which, for


9
example, may be taken as 1/2,000,000
of a second from the beginning, the
current increases, reaching a maxi-
mum of, say, 10 units. Since the mag-
netic field surrounding the oscillator
is proportional to this current it is also
a maximum. The energy of the elec-
tric field has thus been expended in
has decreased to zero, the magnetic
field has disappeared and the electric
field has reappeared, but in a contrary
direction.
The current now reverses, flows
from B to A, and produces a magnetic
field in the opposite direction, i. e.
north magnetic poles would move

making this current flow and in pro-
ducing this magnetic field. But the
current does not stop. It keeps on
flowing though decreasing in magni-
tude. It charges part B positively and
past A negatively, thus producing an
electric field of contrary direction to
the original field. At the end of an-
other 1/2,000,000 second the current
around the Y-Y axis in a direction
contrary to that when the current was
flowing from A to B. At the end of
the third 1/2,000,000 of a second this
reversed current has reached a maxi-
mum value of 9 units instead of 10.
From now on the current decreases in
strength until at the end of the fourth
1/2,000,000 of a second, or 1/500,000


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC.
of a second, from the start, it is again
zero. A is now charged positively, B
negatively, as in the beginning, but to
a lesser degree. This operation re-
peats itself over and over each time
with smaller values.
The action of the oscillator is shown
graphically in Fig. 2. The Line o-x
is the zero axis along which time is
plotted. Distances from this line to
the curves represent values of charge
or current. Thus at the initial condi-
tion the current is zero and the charge
is a maximum, A positive, and B neg-
B is called an oscillatory discharge.
The time required to perform a cycle
is called the period, and the recipro-
cal of the period or the number of cy-
cles per second is called the oscillatory
frequency. Thus the period of the
oscillator taken as an example is
1/500,000 of a second, or the frequen-
cy is 500,000 per second.
THE ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE
It may with reason be asked what
all this has to do with electromagnetic
waves and wireless telegraphy? Fact

ed by the length of the line ot the cur-
rent is decreasing from its maximum
value of ten units and has an instan-
taneous value of at units. Also the
charge has reversed; B is now positive
and A negative, and this reversed
charge has a value of bt units. These
curves represent what are called damp-
ed waves, since similar values are get-
ting smaller as time goes on. The
conditions passed through from one

oscillation. A number of cycles form-

twenty-five years ago has been devel-
oped without serious modification, in-
to the powerful complex oscillators

duces in space what are called electro-
magnetic waves.
All space is fdled with something
which physicists call the ether. The
electric and magnetic effects which
we have considered with reference to
the oscillator of Fig. 1 take place in
this ether. But these electromagnetic
effects do not take place simultaneous-
ly in all parts of the ether. The effect
originates at the oscillator and travels

away from it at a definite velocity.
Thus, returning to the above example,
it was assumed that the current had
reached a maximum value and that the
electric field had disappeared in the
first 1/2,000,000 of a second. But the
the complete disappearance of this
field is true only at the.oscillator. A
short distance away it is decreasing in
strength, but still on the decline, still
farther away, it has not commenced to
disappear.
The magnetic field behaves in a sim-
ilar manner. The speed with which
interlink and depend upon each other,
but with the electric forces at right
angles to the magnetic.
Such constitutes what is called the
electromagnetic wave. It is similar in
many respects to the visible waves in
water and other substances. The dis-
tance measured between similar points
of two successive waves along the line
in which they are travelling is called
a wave length. It is equal to the ve-
locity divided by the frequency or in
the case of the above oscillator it is
300,000,000/500,000 or 600 meters.

these effects travel has been found to
be approximately 186,000 miles, or
300,000,000 meters, per second. Thus
in 1 .'2,000,000 of a second, the distance
covered is 0.093 miles or about 491
feet. In my example the electric field
disappeared at the oscillator in
i/2,oco,ooo second, but 491 feet away
it is just beginning to disappear. From
this it is apparent that, if electric and
magnetic fields are produced, in succes-
sion at the oscillator, they will appear
to move away from the oscillator at a
very high velocity, and an observer at
some distant point will note successive
electric and magnetic effects which de-
crease in strength as the oscillations
decrease in magnitude. These fields
ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES FOR
WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY
From the time Hertz published his
researches investigators tried to use
this oscillator for telegraphy by caus-
ing its electromagnetic waves to affect
a second oscillator some distance
away. Since they travel in all direc-
tions, the waves thus produced are
called "free" electromagnetic waves.
Marconi obtained great success by re-
placing one of the parts of the oscillat-
or, either A or R, by the earth, and
using an elevated wire for the other
part. This is called an earthed oscil-
lator,and the earth, considered as a
perfect conductor, becomes a neutral
plane indicated by the neutral axis of

over the ground surface and extend
upwards great distances. They are
said to be "bound" waves, since they
follow the surface of some object
which in this case is the earth. Some
of the advantages of the earthed oscil-
lator may be cited as follows: (i) The
production of earth surface waves, (2)
the production of longer waves with
greater ease, and (3) the ease of
maintenance of proper mechanical re-
lations between transmitting and re-
ceiving oscillators. This last is espe-
cially true for transmission between
moving objects.
Fig. 3 is a diagram showing this
earthed oscillator at A, the electric
forces of the outgoing waves, and il-
lustrating the meaning of the term
wave length. The arrows indicate the
directions in which positive charges
would move, and the closeness of the
lines is an indication of the intensity
of the force. Fig. 4 is a diagram of
the same oscillator, showing the mag-
netic forces of the waves as circles
drawn about A as a center. Arrows
here indicate the direction in which
north seeking magnetic poles would
move and the intensity of the force is

the electric and magnetic forces or
components of these waves are inter-
linked and go hand in hand. In the
true wave the energy of one equals
the energy of the other, and as one de-
creases at any point the other increases
in the same degree.
THE CLOSED OSCILLATOR
The electric circuit of the Hertz os-
cillator has two important characteris-
tics, that of capacity and that of in-
ductance. We can, therefore, by con-
necting an electrical capacity or con-
denser and an inductive coil in series,
produce an oscillating circuit. Such

a combination is shown in Fig. 5. C
is a condenser consisting of a number
of parallel metallic plates separated by
air spaces, L is a coil of wire and S is
a spark gap of, say, y2". Its operation
is as follows: Imagine the voltage of
the source, which is connected as indi-
cated, to be gradually increasing. As
a result a current will flow into the
condenser which is being charged. As
the voltage increases the air insulation
between the spark points is acted upon
harder and harder by an electric force.
Finally the insulation gives way, al-
lows a large current to flow, the volt-
age fails, and the condenser discharges
in the loop formed by condenser, coil,
and spark gap. This condenser dis-
charge current rises to a maximum and
then decreases to zero. It produces a
similarly growing and decreasing mag-
netic field in and around the coil L.
The decreasing of this field produces
an electromotive force, which again
charges the condenser but in the op-
posite sense. The condenser of re-
versed charge then discharges with a
current flow in the opposite direction.
This process repeats itself over and
over, and we have accordingly an os-
cillating current in the loop formed of
condenser, inductance and spark gap,
exactly as in the Hertz oscillator. As
a matter of fact Fig. 2 applies equally
well to either case.
The frequency or the number of
complete oscillations per second can
be obtained from the formula
f=IH-2lIV^C
where / is the frequency, L is the in-
ductance value, and C the capacity val-
ue both expressed in similar units.
This type of oscillating circuit is
called a closed oscillator while the
Hertz oscillator is called an open os-
cillator. The closed oscillator does not
produce electromagnetic waves to the
same degree as the open, but the con-
denser can be made large enough to
absorb considerable energy and it was
early found that the closed circuit
could be inductively associated with
the open, more energy controlled and
greater distances covered. This com-
bination, in which the open circuit is
formed by aerial wires connected to
the ground through a coil, is shown

wires, and cause that open circuit to
oscillate with the earth as a neutral
plane exactly as in the case of the sim-
ple Hertz oscillator.
TUNING
We come now to the problem of
tuning or syntony between the electric-
al circuits. Any electrical circuit has
a natural frequency at which it oscil-
&lt; lates unless forced to do otherwise. If
we wish to make a circuit oscillate
greatly we must apply forces which
agree with the natural frequency of
that circuit. The pendulum may be
taken as a mechanical example of this
point. Small forces may cause a large
vibration in a pendulum if they are
properly timed.
In Fig. 6 we have two circuits, one
open and the other closed, linked or
coupled at the coils. Oscillations in
the closed circuit, occurring at the nat-
ural frequency of that circuit, produce
oscillations in the open circuit, and in
order to have these a maximum we
must adjust the circuits to make their
natural frequencies equal. This is
done by adjusting the capacity or in-
ductance of each in accordance with
the formula / = i 2 n V L C or&gt; 'n
other words the product of inductance
and capacity of one circuit equals a
similar product for the other. This
adjustment is called "tuning," and
good tuning is absolutely necessary to
success.
The electromagnetic waves produc-
ed by oscillations in the elevated wires
of a radio station produce electric
forces in all surrounding elevated bod-
ies. Thus an elevated wire at a receiv-
ing station will have alternating or
oscillating currents produced in it, and
these will become a maximum when
the natural frequency of the receiving
wire or circuit is equal to the frequen-
cy of the transmitting station. For
this reason we may tune a receiving
circuit to a certain transmitting station,
or to any one of several transmitting
stations which are working simultan-
eously.
But it must not be thought that in-
terference is impossible. Two neigh-
boring stations of equal powers and
wave lengths, transmitting simultan-
eously, necessarily interfere and must
take turns in using the surrounding
ether. In practice the average tuning
is not particularly sharp and consider-
able interference may come from a
station whose frequency differs even
15 per cent or 20 per cent from that
of the station actually being received.
RECEIVING CIRCUIT
From the above general description
of the receiving circuit it is apparent
that it is the same as the transmitting
in many of its essential features. It
does differ, however, in mechanical
construction and in being equipped
with a detector, a device capable of
making the high frequency currents
work a telephone receiver. Fig. 7 is a
diagram showing the essential parts
at both the transmitting and receiving
stations. By means of a suitable
switch a station can be quickly chang-
ed from the receiving to the transmit-
ting condition and vice versa.
TRANSMISSION OF MESSAGES
We are now in a position to under-
stand how messages are sent. Wire-
less operators use cither the Morse or
the Continental code, preferably the
Continental. In either of these codes
letters are formed of dots, dashes and
spaces. A dot is sent by a short clos-
ure of the transmitting key or switch,
a dash by a closure about three times
as long as the dot, and a space by a
short opening of the key. The elec-
trical apparatus is therefore working
for short or long periods or not work-
ing at all. In either code the letter A
is formed by a dot, short space, then
a dash. Each time an operator closes
his key there are a number of separate
discharges of the condenser. The
number of these discharges varies
from 120 to 1000 per second for dif-
ferent stations. Let us take 120 per
second as an example of average prac-


Fiq. 7.
Circuit Diagram for ffadlo Telegraphy.
tice, also assume that the dot lasts 1-5
of a second, and the dash 3-5. There
are therefore 24 separate discharges
for the dot and 72 for the dash, each
discharge being in itself an extremely
high frequency oscillation.
It was early found that human ears
and telephone receivers would not re-
spond to these high frequencies, but
that they were very sensitive to fre-
quencies of several hundred per sec-
ond. The function of the detector is

to change the high frequency oscilla-
tion into a single impulse as far as the
telephone receiver and ear are con-
cerned.
Thus Fig. 8 is a representation of
the radio letter A. There are as many
separate impulses to the receiver dia-
phragm as discharges. A dot is heard
as a short buzz, a dash as a longer
buzz, and a complete message is a

CRYSTAL DETECTORS
There are many classes of detectors.
A particularly interesting class is com-
monly called the crystal detector, and
consists of a crystal or mineral sub-
stance fastened between metallic sur-
faces. Silicon, carborundum, galena
and many others are in common use.
These substances have the property,
when mounted properly, of allowing
an electric current to pass more readily
in one direction than in the other, and
for that reason are called rectifiers
for alternating currents. Thus, if an
alternating electromotive force be im-
pressed upon such a crystal shunted
by a receiver, as indicated in Fig. 7,
practically all of the current passes
through the crystal for one direction
of the force, but through the receiver
for the opposite direction, and from
a complete oscillatory discharge the
receiver diaphragm gets an impulse in
only one direction.
WORLD DEVELOPMENT
Marconi sent the first signals from
Poldhu, Cornwall, to St. Johns, New-
foundland, across the Atlantic Ocean,
in December 1901. Since then thous-
ands of government, commercial and
experimental stations have been built
for both ship and shore use. Fig. 9 is a
world map showing the location of
some of these land stations. The shore
location of practically all of these sta-
tions illustrates the importance of this
method of communication to marine
service.
At the present time both the British
and American governments are plan-
ning to build a chain of high powered
wireless stations practically around the
World. The American series will be
located at the following points: Arling-
ton, Va., Panama, California, Hawaii,
Guam, the Philippines and Samoa. It is
expected that each will cost several
hundred thousand dollars. The first
of the series is just being com-
pleted at Arlington. It consists as
shown in photograph of three steel
towers with a building for the equip-
ment and living quarters for the oper-
ators.
This station is designed to have a
transmitting radius of 3000 miles, us-
ing about 100 kilowatts with a wave
length of several thousand meters.
One tower is 600 feet and the other
two are about 400 feet high. The sta-
tion has been given the call letters
"NAV," and the University has re-
cently been in direct radio communi-
cation with it in daylight.
Another interesting station is the
Cape Cod station of the Marconi Com-
pany. It sends the news of the world
every night to boats on the North At-
lantic, and likewise is heard by thous-
ands of amateur operators scattered
over the Eastern part of the United
States.
WIRELESS PECULIARITIES
After radio telegraphy became an
established fact and long distances
were covered, many interesting facts
developed. It was early found that
transmission over water, especially sea
water was much better than over land.
This, since water is a better conduct-
or, was easy to explain. But it was
also found that transmission in day-
light, especially for short wave lengths,
is poorer than in darkness, and observ-
ers have reported that the condition of
one station in daylight and one in dark-
ness is the poorest condition of all.
Just why this is so no one really
knows, though several theories have
been advanced. It has recently been
reported by Marconi that sending in
a north-southerly direction is better,
everything else being equal, than in an
east-westerly direction, but for reasons
unknown.
It is generally recognized that trans-
mission over land is seriously retard-
ed by green vegetation. Thus in the
winter when the plants and trees are
dry, radio communication can be car-
ried on across country over fairly
great distances, but in the Spring, as
the trees leaf out, the intensity of the
signals becomes smaller and smaller.


19
Peculiar conditions sometimes exist
which are very favorable for the prop-
agation of the waves and which for
a better name are called "freaks." Thus
a 1 or 2 kilowatt station which ordi-
narily does not transmit over a few
hundred miles will, for a short time,
cover a thousand or more miles.
FIELD OF RADIO COMMUNICATION
The great field of usefulness of elec-
tromagnetic waves for communication
purposes seems to lie in transmission
between objects moving relatively to
each other, i. e. between ship and ship,
ship and shore, moving bodies of men,
etc. Its practicability for these pur-
poses has been demonstrated thous-
ands of times. Such a case as the Ti-
tanic disaster merely brings it before
the public. It can truthfully be said
that marine service has been revolu-
tionized by radio communication.
When we stop to think, it is clear
that individuals are constantly moving
relatively to each other with the air
as the general medium of communica-
tion for short distances. But even with
present day transportation methods
the range of communication by sound
waves is too short. The electromag-
netic wave in ether covers enormous
distances at enormous speeds and no
man can move fast enough to run
away from its effects. It must not be
thought that telegraphy is the only
method that can be used. People have
telephoned, using these waves, for
several hundred miles, and the impor-
tance of wireless telephony to the
world is beyond estimate. Imagine
thousands of people being notified si-
multaneously of certain facts by a cen-
tral wireless telephone office. The
economic importance of this to a police
department is very apparent. It is
certain that radio communication has
a great future.

FORCED VIBRATIONS—CRITICAL SPEEDS
By John Airey, D.I.C.
The subject of vibrations manifested its importance to the engineer
in the early clays of high speed machinery, and from that time on has held
his attention. In principle the roll of a ship is just as truly a case of vibra-
tion as is the tremble of the deckplates when the engine is out of balance,
but the former is not generally called a vibration. The term "vibration"
is usually reserved for periodic motions of small magnitude.
Most cases of vibration with which we have to deal are examples of
simple harmonic motion (S.H.M.), or combinations of such motions. If
any rigid body, such as a bar of steel, be distorted within its elastic limit,
then by virtue of Hooke's L,aw, there is a tendency for it to return to the
normal form which is directly proportional to the amount of distortion.
Hence, if the cause of the distortion be removed, the body responds to this
tendency to return, and simple, harmonic vibrations result, which are only
brought to an end by friction. Where vibrations occur in mechanical oper-
ations, they are usually of this same type.
Vibration is of especial importance to the engineer, however, where syn-
chronous action due to some outside influence takes place, with unexpected
and often disastrous results. The classic example of synchronous action is
that of the bridge set to vibrating and broken by the rhythmic tread of the
soldiers. Other examples are the heavy roll of a ship when concerted wave
action takes place; the whipping of shafts when machinery is run at certain
speeds; the heavy torsional oscillations which have been known to occur
between the flywheel of a gas engine and the rotor of the alternator coupled
thereto, sometimes sufficient to break the shaft. It is for the light thrown
on such cases that the following experiment is of value.
Some years ago, before critical speeds had been as fully discussed as at
present, a firm making high speed engines with generators direct coupled,
had several cases of crankshaft fracture. The cause of fracture was per-
plexing, as the maximum torque on the shaft gave a reasonably low unit
stress in the extreme fiber. The trouble was ultimately found to be a surg-
ing action (i. e. heavy torsional oscillations) which took place between the
flywheel and the rotor. The speed of the engine just happened to be danger-
ously close to the natural frequency of torsional oscillations of the com-
bined flywheel, rotor and shaft. This was, of course, easily remedied, once
the fault had been discovered.
An interesting and amusing example of synchronism with which the
writer had to deal was an 'acoustical case. A patent system of large gas
burners had been installed for the purpose of heating a coil-drying oven.
The jets burned in a closed cast iron cylinder about 8 inches diameter by
5 feet long. Air under pressure was supplied to the gas, and the burnt
gases were taken outside the building by a two inch pipe.
Upon starting the equipment a hideous, screeching noise was emitted, suf-
ficient to condemn the whole tiling unless an alteration was effected. After


21
several unsuccessful attempts to stop the noise, vibrations in the exhaust
pipe were suspected-—a case similar to that in the old singing flame
experiment in acoustics—and a piece of inch pipe was telescoped over
the end being allowed to protrude past the end of the exhaust pipe, thus
virtually altering its length. The noise immediately ceased. The exhaust
pipe was no longer an exact multiple of the length of the waves given by the
flame, and synchronous action had therefore been destroyed.
DESCRIPTION OF APPARATUS
The accompanying photograph shows an apparatus designed for the
purpose of magnifying, and so visualising, that which occurs when struc-
tures or revolving masses are subjected to a rhythmic disturbing influence.
Though vibrations may appear quite different in practice, e. g. the cases
cited in the preceding paragraphs, they are closely related in principle, and
their mathematical discussion leads to the same type of equation.
The simplest possible case was accordingly chosen, and the apparatus so
constructed that the motion could be easily observed: If a spiral spring be
rigidly fixed at its upper end, and it support a mass m at its lower end, and
this mass be given a slight displacement downward and left to recover, it
will execute a S.H.jM. with period T = 2 n V m/h; where h = force re-

quired to stretch the spring unit length. If, in addition, there be a means of
giving the upper end of the spring a small periodic motion in a vertical line,
the simplest case of a forced vibration is obtained in the spring.
This is the principle of the apparatus. For the purpose of quantitative
experiments the suspended weights can be varied from 3 lbs. to 8 lbs. by
intervals of 1 lb. The mass of the spring is not negligible in applying the
above formula. It is approximately correct to add one-third of its weight
to the suspended weights.*
The amplitude of the motion given to the top of the spring can be varied
from o to 1/2, by varying the throw of the crank-pin. The frequency of this
motion can also be varied from 8 per minute to 800 per minute, by changing
the speed of the driving motor. In order to illustrate the effect of syn-
chronous action it is necessary to be able to vary the frequency of the forced
vibration very finely.f
In operating the apparatus the observed phenomena were as follows:
As the forced vibration frequency was increased from o up to about half
the natural frequency of the combination, or synchronous frequency, the
motion of the weight was not perceptibly greater than the motion given to
the point of support of the spring. Further increase of the frequency
brought greater and greater amplitude into play, until, near the synchronous
*The spring will open uniformly, very approximately, i. e., the pitch of the
spiral will be the same at all parts of the spring. The displacement of any part of the
spring from its normal position is then proportional to the distance from the fixed
end. The velocity is also, therefore, proportional to this distance. Let p be the mass
of the spring per unit length; x be the distance of element considered from the
fixed end; 1 be the length of the spring; v be the velocity of the lower end at the
instant considered; and m be the mass which, attached to the spring at the lower end,
would replace the effect of the mass of the spring. Then:

f As a smooth speed variation over a wide range was
needed, a standard rheostat could not be used. The motor
used was a standard 1/12 horsepower, shunt wound Westing-
house, R.P.M. 1000. By connecting up as shown in diagram,
a smooth variation from 20 to 17000 R.P.M. was obtained.
The voltage on the field could be lowered to increase the
speed, and the voltage on the armature lowered to reduce the
speed.

speed, the oscillations became so violent as to require checking for fear of
injury to the apparatus. In the neighborhood of the synchronous speed
beats were very evident, for, by careful adjustment of the forced fre-
quency, the motion could be made to increase gradually to 6 inches, and then
die down to o, remain instantaneously at rest, and then repeat the whole
cycle. As the forced frequency is increased beyond the critical, the effect on
the motion of the weight falls off remarkably quickly, and at the highest
speed the weight is practically dead.
MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS
The crank-pin and slotted cross-slide mechanism give to the top of the
spring a S.H.M. If y feet be the displacement of the top of the spring below
its mean position, and if the crank-pin make q rads. per second, then
y = a sin qt expresses the forced motion of the upper end of the spring.
If x feet be the displacement of the weight at any instant, below its mean
position, then spring extension due to vibration is, at the instant, x —y feet.
If the stiffness of the spring is such that h lbs. will stretch it 1 foot, then
the equation of motion is

Equation (1) is a linear differential equation with constant coefficients,

the spring. If therefore q = k, we have synchronous action.
In figure I, A is shown as a function of the ratio q/k; it is seen to become
infinitely large when this ratio becomes unity, and also to change sign when
passing through infinity.

Equation (4) has been plotted to show the motion of the weight when
q = k.
From this we see that the amplitude of the motion increases indefinitely
with time.
To illustrate the rapid accumulation of motion when running at the syn-


27

plete vibrations and also after 100 vibrations, and so find the magnification.

i. e. the magnifications of the motion given to the spring is 20 II or 63
times; and in 100 vibrations the magnification would be over 600 times.
This shows how quickly disastrous forced vibrations can be if they happen to
synchronize with the natural period.
On the other hand, if q becomes much greater than k, the motion of the
weight becomes actually smaller than the motion of the top of the spring. If
in equation (3) q be made infinitely great, say 1/8, where 8 ultimately van-
ishes, we have:

An approximation to this is seen when q/k= 10. A study of the curves
shows that the further above the critical speed a machine be run the stead-
ier it becomes. This is observed in starting up a small turbine; as the speed
increases the wheel settles down to steadier running.

MICHIGAN MEN
When the establish-
prof. william ment of a course in
christian HOADSanitary Engineering
was finally determin-
ed upon last spring, the search for the
best available man was begun. Nearly
all suggested candidates were gradu-
ates of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, where work in Sanitary-
Engineering w:as commenced much
earlier than in other schools and is
very thorough, and it was from among
these graduates that the choice was
finally made.
The favorable endorsements of Pro-
fessors Parker and Dwight, and of
Doctor Swayne, of Harvard, directed
our attention particularly to William
Christian Hoad, Professor of Civil
Engineering, and head of that depart-
ment, at Kansas University, and after
some weeks we were fortunate enough
to secure his acceptance of the chair of
Sanitary Engineering.
Professor Hoad spent his boyhood
on his father's farm in eastern Kansas,
where he was born 38 years ago. He
entered Lane College, a denomination-
al school at Lecompton, Kansas, and
after finishing his course there, enter-
ed Kansas University from which he
was graduated in 1898. He then en-
tered the service of the Atchison, To-
peka and Santa Fe Railroad, doing lo-
cation, construction and maintenance
work for two years, and returned to
Kansas University in 1900 as an in-
structor. He was later made Assist-
ant Professor.
In 1906-7 he was granted a leave of
absence, and went to Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, where he
spent the time in special research work
in Sanitary Engineering and a study
of water purification and sewage dis-
posal plants in the eastern part of the
United States. Returning to Kansas
he was made Associate Professor, and
took charge of the Sanitary Engineer-
ing courses.
When the Kansas water and sewage
law was passed, Professor Hoad was
made Chief Engineer of the State
Board of Health. He was also given
charge of the administrative work of
the State Engineering Department, a
large part in the development of a
policy with reference to the safeguard-
ing of public water supplies and san-
itary control of streams, and in the
framing of legislation for making this
policy effective.
During his five years administration
some forty sewage disposal plants and
fifteen water purification plants were
built and put into successful operation,
a strong public sentiment was devel-
oped in favor of civic improvement,
and the practice of engineering in the
state was placed on a much higher
plane than ever before. That this was
very largely due to his enthusiasm and


29
personality is evidenced by the reluc-
tance with which Kansas let him go,
and by hundreds of editorial and news
items in Kansas papers regarding his
efficient public service. The wisdom
which Michigan displayed in making
him her choice is also shown by the
plans which he has already developed
for the establishment of a sanitary lab-
oratory, and a most complete and effi-
cient schedule for Sanitary Engineer-
ing work.
Professor Iload has done much
work in the evaluation of water works
property, and, as consulting engineer,
in water and sewage design. His last
year in Kansas he was head of the De-
partment of Civil Engineering, and at
the time of his appointment here he
was Acting Dean. Since coming to
Michigan he has acted as consulting
engineer with City Engineer H. E.
Terry, '77E, in the preparation of a
complete set of plans for sewerage
for the city of Flint, and has been re-
tained by the city of Adrian as their
representative in the evaluation of the
water works.
He is a member of the American
Society of Civil Engineers, the New
England Water Works Association,
the Society for the Promotion of En-
gineering Education, the American As-
sociation for the Advancement of Sci-
ence, and numerous local and state
scientific societies.
BY PROFESSOR H. E. RIGCS.
In the testing department of a large
electrical manufacturing plant use is
made of a liquid tachometer, com-
monly known as a "liquid tack." One
of the new arrivals on test was told by
his foreman to "Go up to the instru-
ment room and ask for a liquid tack."
The young man had eveidently heard
something of the jokes which are play-
ed on newcomers in shops, and was
suspicious. Instead of departing as
requested, he retired loafingly to the
rear of one of the machines. The fore-
man found him there a short time lat-
er, and asked him if he had gotten the
instrument. With an air of wisdom
the young engineer answered, "Ah,
you can't kid me. I'm from Harvard."

ALUMNI NOTES
Dean Cooley is in re-
iNu^°"™ ceipt of a letter from
AMERICAN „ * , . .
fields C. G. Newton, '98E,
who is now superin-
tendent of the power plants of the
Braden Copper Company at Rancag-
ua, Chile, South America.
In the fifteen years that have elapsed
since his graduation from the Univer-
sity, Mr. Newton has been a good deal
of a ''Globe Trotter." He commenced
work in '98 with the U. S. Ship Canal
Commission. He then, for three years,
was Structural Draftsman and Squad
Boss, in Pittsburgh, on a large amount
of structural work. He then went to
California on survey work, thence to
Arizona on the Southern Pacific Rail-
road, thence to the Puget Sound coun-
try. He was then with the Mississippi
River Commission at St. Louis, went
back to the coast, worked on the
World's Fair construction at Portland,
Oregon, and later became interested
in a company manufacturing gold
dredges and stamp mills. He then
went to Alaska, built eighteen miles of
railroad, and a hydro-electric power
plant to supply placer dredges. Among
other interesting pieces of work done
by him in Alaska were a seventy mile
ditch, seven miles of wrood stave pipe
and three miles of steel pipe, all four
feet in diameter. This pipe constituted
six siphon lines for the Yukon Gold
Company, and one of these siphons
had one and one quarter miles of pipe
under 1150 feet static head (500 lbs.
pressure).
Upon completion of work in Alaska,
Mr. Newton went to Chile and became
superintendent of construction and en-
gineer of hydro-electric plant to sup-
ply mills and copper mines of the Bra-
den Copper Company where he has
been for the past three years. He has
there built some large hydro-electric
plants, steel tower transmission lines,
substations, etc., aggregating during
the past six or seven years over three
million dollars worth of work. He
is now making surveys and plans for
a 25,000 K. W. hydro-electric instal-
lation in northern Chile.
Mr. Newton, in speaking of the
South American countries and possi-
bilities for employment there of Amer-
ican engineers, says: "Coming to the
subject of the Spanish language, I
wonder how many Americans realize
what a Spanish country lies south of
them. Taking Mexico, Central and
South America, there is altogether an
area of 7,800,000 square miles, or
2 6-10 times the area of the United
States, 75 per cent of it ranking among
the richest lands on the globe, in al-
most every kind of undeveloped re-
sources.
"This country will soon be the
stamping ground of the American en-
gineer. Many of the European engi-
neers who come out here, seem, for
some reason, not to have the 'Punch.'
With the exception of the railroads in
the Argentine, and some in Chile,
where English capital is largely inter-
ested, almost all of the notable enter-
prises in South America have been
put in by American engineers. Bo-
livia's system of railroads was put in
by American Engineers, also those of
Peru and Ecuador. Bolivia is about
to extend her system greatly with
American capital, and of course Amer-
ican engineers; also Colombia. Peru is
building a line to connect from the
Eima-Cerro de Pasco line to ocean
steamer navigation on the Amazon,
with American engineers.
"American Copper Companies are
going into Chile, Bolivia and Peru.
American Gold Mining Companies are
going into Colombia and Ecuador. The
first ship loads of Venezuelan iron
were shipped, the other day, from up
the Orinoco. Brazilian iron will soon
come into the market. Peru has some
of the richest mining country in the
world, simply lacking transportation
facilities.


31
"Brazil is larger than the United
States and is hardly explored, but they
are developing water power near the
coast by the 1.000,000 H. P., for city
light and power, and for sugar mill and
cotton mill uses. Hardwood timber
is to be found in almost all parts of
the Amazon and Orinoco Basins. The
Beef Trust has plants in Uruguay and
Argentina, and is building more.
"Besides these, there is the well
known development work going on in
Mexico, Central America and Cuba,
where American capital is pre-eminent.
All of this means work for engineers,
and American engineers who have
some knowledge of Spanish will in
most cases have the first call.
"When I came to Chile three years
ago, there were probably not more
than thirty Americans in Chile, out-
side of the 'Beach Comber' and 'Typ-
ical Tropical Tramp' classes. Today
two companies alone, have brought in
one hundred and twenty engineers and
workmen, and more are coming by al-
most ever boat.
"On account of these things, I think
that if I were to take my college course
over again, I would put three years
into Spanish, and call it enough lan-
guage. If a man knows English and
Spanish, he will never be at a loss in
North or South America, for while
Portuguese is spoken in Brazil, it is
easily picked up by a man who knows
Spanish."
WORK ON
LOUISIANA
WATERWAYS
John L. Dickey, mem-
ber Am. Soc. C. E., a
native of Niles, Mich-
igan, who was a grad-
uate of the Department of Engineering
in the class of 1902, is now in charge
of large construction works in Louisi-
ana.
His first employment after gradua-
tion was as assistant in summer camp,
at the close of which he was appointed
inspector in the U. S. Engineering De-
partment, on the improvement of
Grand River, La. From this he was
transferred, in 1903, to the position of
inspector on the construction of Pla-
quemine Lock, in charge of which
work was J. I. Conklin, of the class of
'98. In 1904 Dickey was transferred
to Southwest Pass, Mississippi River,
as junior engineer on the great jet-
ties at that place. This work, involv-
ing the expenditure of $4,000,000, was
under the supervision of Cornelius
Donovan, of the class of '72, upon
whom was conferred the degree of
Doctor of Engineering in 1912.
From this work Mr. Dickey was
transferred again, in 1898, to Xew Or-
leans, where he was placed in charge
of fortification work at Forts St. Phil-
ip and Jackson, made famous by the
historic fight with Farragut on his pas-
sage up the river, and given charge
also of minor inland waterway im-
provement in the district. The forti-
fication work included the construction
of a sea wall, at the forts, and the
building and maintenance of range-
finding stations, batteries, magazines
and sub-marine mine accessories.
The Plaquemine Lock, of which Mr.
Dickey is now in charge, and on which
he was inspector during construction,
is a $1,000,000 project. The lock has
a maximum lift, during high water,
of forty feet. It connects Bayou Pla-
quemine, formerly an estuary of the
Mississippi, about 200 miles above
New Orleans, with the Mississippi by
a navigable channel, and opens to the
commerce of the river towns about
2,000 miles of navigable waterways in
western Louisiana.
He is also in charge, at present, of
the improvement of numerous naviga-
ble streams, including the construction
of Keystone Lock and Dam, on Bay-
ou Teche, and the Intercoastal Canal
in Louisiana, which project includes
an inland waterway from Boston,
Massachusetts, to Brownsville, Texas.
Through his geniality and sterling
character, Mr. Dickey has won many
friends in the south, not only for him-
self but for the University.

DEPARTMENTAL NOTES
At the recent conven-
scJl?°bt °J tion of the American
ARCHITECTURE T ... . r a i •
associate Institute of Archi-
tects, the heads of
seven of the American architectural
schools formed an organization which
is to be called the Association of Col-
legiate Schools of Architecture. The
purpose of the organization is to do
for architecture what the Society for
the Promotion of Engineering Educa-
tion does in its particular field. The
organization will have an annual meet-
ing preferably coinciding with that of
the American Institute of Architects.
The schools represented at this, the
first, meeting were:
Massachusetts Institute of Technol-
University of Pennsylvania.
Cornell University.
University of Illinois.
Carnegie Technical Institute.
University of California.
University of Michigan.
Professor Lorch of the University
of Michigan was elected vice-president
and a member of the executive com-
mittee. The first steps toward form-
ing such an organization were taken
by the Architectural Department of
the University of Michigan three or
four years ago, when a circular letter
was sent out urging that the various
architectural schools meet occasionally
to discuss their particular problems.
A new tire protection
new fire system, with 12 inch
protection , „ • „
system "'S'1 pressure mains,
and hydrants at all
advantageous points, has been install-
ed on the campus. Two 150 H. P.,
motor driven centrifugal pumps have
been installed in the hydraulic labora-
tory, to make room for which the po-
sition of the old 15 inch centrifugal
pump was shifted. The centrifugal
pumps were built by the Manistee Iron
Works Company, of Manistee, Mich-
igan; the driving motors by the Fair-
banks Morse Company; and the pip-
ing in the laboratory was furnished by
the Shaw-Kendall Engineering Com-
pany, of Toledo, Ohio. Schumaker
and Backus, of Ann Arbor, took the
contract for the underground piping
on the campus.
Some very interest-
electrostatic jn„ experiments are
separation of , *? 1 , ...
GAS FROM TAR belI1S .made at *e S3!
experiment station of
the Michigan Gas Association, located
at the Ann Arbor Gas Works, on a
new process of removing tar from coal
gas by means of high tension electri-
cal discharge. Some new equipment
has been ordered and the apparatus
in the gas works has been rearranged
to better fit the plant for experimental
work. Tests are also being made to
determine the effect of weathering
upon coal. R. B. Rowley, who holds
the Michigan Gas Association Fellow-
ship, is in charge of the experiments.
A further description of the work will
appear in a later issue of The Tech-
nic.
Although complete
hydraulic plans and specifica-
EXPERIMENT [. , v . .
station tions have not yet
been drawn up, the
Department of Civil Engineering pro-
poses the erection of a hydraulic ex-
periment station on the Huron River,
to be finished and ready for use at the
beginning of the next school year. Ex-
periments in the flow of water over
weirs and through orifices, and for the
determination of various hydraulic co-
efficients will constitute the general
character of the work of the station.
In a similar station at Cornell Univer-
sity valuable research work of this
character has already been done. Pro-
fessor II. W. King has charge of the
design and construction.

The Department of
architects Architecture has re-
ACQUIRE ., . , „
exhibits cently acquired a full
size plaster cast of a
Corinthian capital from the Roman
temple at Cori, in Italy. The depart-
ment has also secured a large number
of valuable original drawings from ar-
chitects which are instructive as ex-
amples of design, draftsmanship and
rendering, and conform to the very
highest standards of current profes-
sional practice. These drawings have
been mounted and now hang on the
walls of the drafting rooms.
Under the supervision of the city
engineer the city of Ann Arbor has
driven two new 8 inch wells on the J.
B. Steere farm. These new wells seem
to be fully as good as the others which
were driven a year or more ago. They
are located some distance east of the
old wells, from which they differ in
that the well casings are driven down
to the bottom of the water bearing
stratum, and the strainers contain
more perforations. The head on the
new wells is a little lower than on the
old. Specifications for pumping the
seven wells have been drawn up by the
city engineer and advertisement has
been made for bids for the job. The
pumping test will probably be made
during February or March.
Prof. Sadler returned from An-
napolis 'just before Christmas, where
he spent two months in giving lectures
and working out a system of post
graduate courses for engineers at the
United States Naval Academy. Prof.
Bragg is now there occupied with the
same work. He is expected to return
to Ann Arbor in February.
Mr. B. Dyer of the National Car-
bon Company, of Cleveland, gave a
lecture before the Chemical Engineer-
ing students December n on the sub-
ject "The Manufacture of Carbon
Products."
W. T. Fishleigh who was formerly
an instructor in the drawing depart-
ment and who has been on leave of
absence for two or three years, has
been appointed Assistant Professor of
Fngineering Mechanics, and will re-
sume his duties in the Engineering
Department at the beginning of the
second semester.
The detail plans for the sewage dis-
posal plant which is to be erected on
the river have been completed, and the
construction work will go ahead as
soon as the weather permits. A full
description of the plant will appear in
a later issue of The Technic.
The American Institute of Chemical
Engineers held a portion of its fifth
annual meeting in the amphitheater of
the Chemistry Building on Friday De-
cember 6. A number of papers were
read by well known chemists.
George Tonson, Chief Engineer of
the Board of Public Service of Toledo,
gave a very interesting talk before the
Engineering Society December io on
the subject "Asphalt and Other Plas-
tic Paving."
The glider made in the shops last
year has been tried out and has made
a number of successful short flights.
It is not equipped with an engine,
however, so that long nights are im-
possible.
A series of experiments are being
conducted in the naval tank to deter-
mine the effect of length and breadth
of vessels upon the resistance offered
by the water.
Prof. Johnston gave an address be-
fore the Toledo Engineering Society
on Friday December 13 on the subject
of "Public Control of Streams."

SEMESTERS
PROGRAM?
There is a time and a
place for everything.
In view of the fact
that the election of
courses for the second semester of the
current year is now but a few days
removed, it seems appropriate to call
attention to the importance of a'
judicious selection, particularly for
the benefit of those who are desirous
of improving the opportunities pre-
sented in the new curriculum.
The most natural, but nevertheless
a most lamentable tendency of the
young engineer is to bury himself too
deeply in the studies of his particular
profession, and so miss the broaden-
ing influence which a more liberal
program would afford. Being an
engineer does not impose an obligation
to do "slip-stick" work along one par-
ticular line, to the exclusion of every-
thing else. Take a look then, at a
few, a very few, of the courses which
are available, but which are not visible
under the near-sighted focus of the
specialist. You Mechanicals, Electri-
cals, Navals, etc., look to the Civil
Department for some instruction.
You Civils, cease asking, "Can any
good come out of M. E?"
Everyone contemplating hydro-
electric work must remember that
there is much more to the subject than
the preliminary survey and the design
of the dam. With that finished, the
work is but commenced. The proper'
installation of turbines, dynamos, and
other machinery, the wiring, the trans-
mission, the distribution—in other
words, the construction of the entire
plant, is the ultimate problem; and
the whole of the work embraces a field
covered only by the various branches
of engineering. Professor King, in
courses C. E. II, 12, and 13, deals
with the flow and the development of
streams, including some very interest-
ing field work in actual stream cali-
bration. In M. E. 9, Professor An-
derson offers the fundamentals of
power plants and power transmission.
During the past semester, part of this
course was devoted to lectures by
Professor Johnson upon the location
and construction of dams. Profes-
sor DeMuralt offers a similar course
in E. E. II, more attention being paid
to the electrical side; while Professor
Zowski, in M. E. 16 and 16a, offers
most excellent courses in the design
of water turbines and centrifugal
pumps. A new course in Sanitary
Science, C. E. 34, is to be given by
Professor Hoad. Practical experience
and a thorough knowledge of the sub-
ject have enabled Professor Hoad to
make this a most valuable course. One
of the most thorough courses in en-
gine design is found in the Depart-
ment of Naval Architecture, the ex-
cellent facilities of which make it
possible for Professors Sadler and
Bragg to offer very instructive w7ork
in this high-class branch of engineer-
ing. Mr. Vernor, in M. E. 20, con-
ducts a class in "Mechanical Handling
of Materials," which is all that could
be desired as an all-round presenta-
tion of that subject. M. E. 18 and


35
18a are two very thorough courses in
"Heating and Ventilation," which in-
clude practical design work.
Aside from these strictly scientific
subjects, there are many cultural sub-
jects offered which are of inestimable
value. One of the best of these is
Freehand Drawing. Drawing is one
of the fundamental powers of expres-
sion. It is graphical speech, appli-
cable to all kinds of work, and offers
a most valuable training of hand, eye,
brain and imagination.
The wealth of valuable information
is too abundant to permit of detailed
comment. It is our desire not to ad-
vise, but merely to call attention to the
many opportunities at hand. You can-
not hope to take everything. Only
elect wisely, and then leave several
hours a week in which to visit a class
to Professor Nelson in "The Study of
Six Great Novels," or to Professor
Wenley of the Literary Department in
"Philosophy."
FACULTY
AND ALUMNI
To engineering stu-
T?J5.T.U,D,ENTS' dents The Technic
presents a unique op-
portunity to help their
University and their department, and
to gain for themselves valuable prac-
tical experience. It needs students to
carry on the current work of publica-
tion—secure contributions, advertis-
ing and circulation, report depart-
mental happenings, and handle copy
and proof as they are received.
Students alone, however, cannot
make The Technic a success. Fac-
ulty members and alumni must be re-
lied on to contribute articles of many
kinds for publication, and earnestly to
advise improvements in its policy and
methods of management.
The Technic, as the representa-
tive organ of the engineering depart-
ment, has been published under the
auspices of the Engineering Society
for a quarter of a century, part of the
time as an annual, part as a semi-
annual. Many engineering alumni
receive copies of it regularly after
graduation, all members of the Engi-
neering Society receive it, and this
year Freshmen are required to use it
as a supplementary text-book in their
English classes. Besides this it has a
considerable outside circulation.
This year a policy has been adopted
of publishing monthly, which means
many times the work of publishing
annually or semi-annually, and neces-
sitates a much larger staff. Because
of the extra duties this throws upon
the management, every item of assist-
ance which can be rendered by stu-
dents, faculty and alumni is needed.
This editorial will reach many
alumni who have had experience with
The Technic while in the Univer-
sity, and since their graduation have
acquired excellent ideas on the subject
of Technical Journalism. They are
able to tell us, if they will do so by
letter or otherwise, many things which
we need to know. Many alumni, also,
will see an opportunity to turn to us
articles or information which will be
of interest in the magazine and which
we would ordinarily fail to obtain.
We will heartily appreciate anything
of this nature which they may do.
Of students we would make a re-
quest that any who can do a few hours
of work a week, under the instruction
of the staff members, deposit applica-
tions, addressed to The Michigan
Technic in the box in the rooms of
the Engineering Society. We need
especially underclassmen who will
learn the business and remain with
The Technic to develop it into a
better monthly in the future.
Students, at least, will see an op-
portunity to benefit themselves by the
experience to be gained in the work.
But where personal benefit may seem
small, we intend this editorial as an
appeal to the patriotism of all men of
the department, and feel certain of a
considerable response.

development of durable, reliable, sensitive and accurate Instruments for use on alternating
current circuits.
Every detail of each of these Instruments has been most carefully studied and worked out so
as to be sure that each shall folly meet the most exacting requirements of the service for which
it is intended. Neither pains nor expense has been spared In the effort to produce instruments
having the longest possible life, the best possible scale characteristics, combined with great ac-
curacy under the most violent load fluctuations and also under the many other trying conditions
met with in practical work. Every part of each instrument is made strictly toguage and the
design and workmanship and finish is of the highest order of excellence.
We invite the most critical examination of every detail of each member of the group. We
also solicit the fullest investigation of the many other novel features and very valuable operative
characteristics of these new instruments and request a careful comparison in all these respects
with any other make of Instruments intended for like service. We offer them as a valuable and
permanent contribution to the art of electrical measurement. Their performance in service
will be found to justify the claim that no other makes of instruments approach them in fitness
for the service required of A. C. Switchboard indicating instruments. »

A COMPARISON OF ARCH AND GRAV-
ITY DAMS
BY F. N. MENEEEE, C. E.
AT TIMES during the last few
years the attention of the en-
gineering profession has been
attracted by serious failures of dams,
and almost without exception they
were of the old gravity type. Failure
often happened, too, as a consequence
of the upward pressure upon the nat-
urally broad base.
In seeking to avoid the dangers to
which the gravity dam is inherently
exposed, the profession has turned,
where conditions will permit, to the
hollow type and the arch dam. The
conditions governing the choice of
type are sharply defined, but in both
cases the danger of upward pressure
can be almost entirely eliminated. In
fact if it were to exist in the case of
the dam designed to resist the hori-
zontal pressure entirely by arch ac-
tion, the assumptions made would be
more nearly exact.
The arch dam is not entirely new;
it was used in France as early as 1843,
when the Zola dam was built, the first
of the kind, which owes its stability
solely to horizontal arch action. It
is 119.75 feet high above the founda-
tions, and when backed by a full head
of water the resultant pressure . line
lies 11.48 feet outside of the base.
However the adoption of the arch
principle, except as an increased fac-
tor of safety for gravity dams, has
been slow in this country. Many ac-
cept the concrete arch bridge with its
varying live loads, impact and expos-
ure to wind forces, who are skeptical
of the arch dam because of its appar-
ent frailness. However the simplicity
of the theory and design, and the cer-
tainity with which the loading can be
taken, really make it more satisfactory
to deal with than the arch bridge,
where, at best, the amount and direc-
tion of the loading is based on as-
sumptions more or less correct, but
the theory of which has never been
entirely proved.
It was while making surveys for
irrigation laterals during the summer
of 1911, that the writer was called up-
on to investigate a dam site on the
Deschutes River in Central Oregon;
and subsequently to design an arch
dam for the purpose of raising the
river water from its canon to the ad-
joining plateau, a distance of about
32 feet.
The work was part of an irrigation
project being promoted and operated
by the Central Oregon Irrigation
Company, of Bend, Oregon, with Mr.
C. M. Redfield as Chief Engineer.
The Deschutes River at this point
has a very uniform flow, with a mini-
mum of about 1400 second feet. It
is fed from the snows on the eastern
slope of the Cascade Range of moun-

tains and flows northward to the Co-
lumbia, at times through rocky canons
and again through stretches of lava
formation that have a tendency to
carry away, by seepage, through
the porous rock, all the waters of the
minimum flow.
Figure i shows a cross section of
the stream bed at the proposed site,
the walls and bed being of solid rock.
Diamond drill borings gave little
doubt as to the strength of the walls
and foundations, but there was a
slight apprehension that the raising

gation manual.

of the water surface might give rise
to the loss of water through crevices
into subterranean channels. Although
investigation was made; nothing defi-
nite could be learned in this regard.
While the cheapness of the arch dam
as compared with the gravity type
was the main factor in the decision
for the arch, the fact that crevices
existed with their liability of allowing
upward pressure, was also taken into
account.
For purpose of estimate a gravity
section dam had been previously com-
puted, the estimate being $54,000. It
was thought, however, that the site
with its solid rock walls and their
adaptability to taking any thrust
which might be imposed upon them,
might permit the use of an arch dam,
with a saving of material.
This formula may be found in any
text book on mechanics as that for
determining the unit stress on a thin
cylindrical shell, produced by a uni-
form radial pressure. It was not
known just how nearly this formula
might apply to a ring 10 or 12 feet
thick, so it was decided that the use
of the ordinary graphical solution for
the stone arch bridge would be made,
namely, that of drawing carefully to
scale J/2 of the lamina of arch in ques-
tion at an assumed radius (see fig. 2),
and taking moments of the forces act-
ing on it. about the point T, on the
skew back to find what horizontal
pressure the other half of the arch
would exert midway between the in-
trados and extrados at the crown, to
make the summation of moments
equal to zero.

Figure 2 represents the lamina of
arch at a depth of 20 feet below the
top of the dam, or 25 feet below the
surface of the maximum flood. Dis-
tances of 10 feet along the upstream
face were carefully laid off, and the
pressure at that depth and over 10
feet, was considered concentrated at
the midpoint of the 10 foot section.
tant pressure line in figure 2). It is
because the arch is symmetrically
loaded that only yi of it need be in-
vestigated and that the thrust at the
crown is horizontal.
Figure 2 also shows the result of
the graphics, verifying &gt; very closely
the formula t = pr, which in this case

The forces were carefully drawn to
scale, and their horizontal and verti-
cal components taken. Their coor-
dinates with respect to point T were
carefully scaled and these values tabu-
lated in table I. Column 8 gives the
total moment of the force of the water
to be resisted by a thrust at the crown,
thus making summation of moments
= 0.
This force being known in direction
and in magnitude, a force polygon
was drawn and from it the funicular
or equilibrium polygon (called resul-
as compared with 269,324 pounds ob-
tained by graphics. The rays ok—oa
to the force polygon represent the
total stress across the section to whose
letter they radiate from the pole. It
is readily seen that they are of the
same length, and that the resultant
pressure line practically follows a cir-
cle concentric with the upstream face
and downstream face and midway be-
tween them. This will be the case for
any radius chosen.
In the case in question is was soon
discovered that if the radius were


11
kept constant for all levels the unit
stresses increased faster as the bot-
tom of the dam was approached than
if the radius were shortened. That
is, t could be kept the same by mak-
ing pr a constant, which would neces-
sitate making r smaller as p increased
with greater depths.
By keeping t a constant the thick-
ness of the section could be kept the
same from top to bottom of the dam.
The effect of this shortening of the
radius would be to cause each succes-
sive lamina to protrude upstream be-
yond the one above, giving a surface
difficult to construct. For a more
detailed account of this effect see an
article entitled, "Arch Dam Design:
The Constant-Angle Arch Dam," in
the Engineering News of July 25,
1912.
For what were considered practical
reasons the radius was kept constant
in this case, the increase in t being
cared for by increasing the thickness
T of the dam, keeping the upstream
face vertical as shown in the cross sec-
tion in figure 3. The maximum al-
lowable unit stress on the concrete
was taken at 250 pounds per square
inch. Strictly speaking the down-
stream face would be a straight line
inasmuch as p in the formula t =pr
increases uniformly when r is a con-
stant, for instance between the 5 foot
level, and the 30 foot level, the varia-
tion in • thickness T would be as
a straight line between the. values of
T in table 2.
Reference to figure 3 will show
that this variation in thickness was
not maintained throughout, 3.5 feet
being the minimum, since the compu-
tations based on the pressure of the
water do not provide for the effect of
the thrust of ice. Again the addi-
tional thickness at the 30 foot level
made very little difference in the vol-
ume of concrete, this being the nar-
row part of the canon, and was con-
sidered an additional safety. In gen-
eral, however, the writer is of the
opinion that the straight line varia-
tion in thickness is better where the
radius is kept constant, since this
causes the unit stresses to remain the
same throughout the dam and reduces
the tendency to shearing between
those levels where the unit compres-
sive stresses are different.
Theoretically there is no bending
moment in the horizontal arch rings
since the resultant pressure line fol-
lows the natural axis. However when
the full pressure of water is on, the
central portion of the top of the dam
will naturally deflect downstream
producing cantilever action about
the base. Because of this fact and
for additional safeguard, the original
design included the placing of Y\ inch
square reinforcing bars, spaced one
foot apart, horizontally and vertically
throughout the length and heighth,
and imbedded one foot from the up-
stream face.
The estimated cost of this dam
based on the same conditions as the
previously estimated gravity dam was
$40,000, a saving of $14,000, with
opinion favoring the arch dam.
For further information concern-
ing dams of this type a very complete
account may be found in the Engi-
neering News of May 19, 1910, of 13
dams built in New South Wales, Aus-
tralia. The boldest of them is 65 feet
high and 8.96 feet thick at the base.
At first thought one is struck by its
apparent frailness, but with a radius
of only 60 feet, the unit compression
is but 186 pounds per square inch.
This dam is now seven years old.

THE NATURE AND PURPOSE OF THE SANI*
TARY EXPERIMENT STATION
BY PROFESSOR W. C. HOAD.
THE REGENTS recently appro-
priated money for a Sanitary
Experiment Station in the De-
partment of Civil Engineering, and
plans have now been drawn up for
the plant. It is intended to begin
Fuller Street. The slope of the hill-
side at this point will permit the dif-
ferent structures of the plant to be
grouped in compact and economical
arrangement.
The present plans relate largely to

construction work as soon as weather
conditions permit, and push it to com-
pletion during the early springtime.
The location assigned by the Re-
gents for the Station building is on
the north slope, below the present
heating plant of the hospitals, near
the treatment and proper disposal of
city sewage, and other city wastes;
and to the protection of streams and
lakes from pollution. It is expected
that after the station has been in oper-
ation for a time, its activities will be
extended to include certain problems

of public water supply and of water
purification.
It is the intention to build at the
beginning small, model units of such
sewage purification devices as have
been demonstrated useful by trial esle-
where, and to operate these continu-
ously for long periods of time under
careful supervision, so giving them
a thorough trying out under the con-
ditions existing in southern Michigan.
Economical and efficient sewage treat-
ment, like sound highway improve-
ment, consists largely of the adapta-
tion of well tried principles to local
conditions of climate, topography,
geological formation, sewage charac-
teristics, and the like. The impdrtance
of taking into account this local fac-
tor in sewage disposal work can
scarcely be over-emphasized. Serious
blunders are continually being made
through the blind copying of plans
of sewage works that may have been
in successful use elsewhere, without
proper allowance for differing local
conditions.
PURPOSE
One of the chief functions of the
station will be to illustrate in a con-
crete manner, to the students in the
civil engineering courses, these vari-
ous processes of sewage treatment,
and to furnish to them a convenient
means of studying the application of
sewage treatment principles in prac-
tical engineering designs. Used in
this way, the station should be an im-
portant adjunct to the class room.
When the treatment of the sewage
of any city is first proposed, there is
always a number of rather elementary
questions that need to be answered
concerning the nature of the process,
and of the engineering devices by
which it is effected. To the mind of
the ordinary city official the whole
subject of sewage purification is
clothed in mystery—is likely, indeed,
to be looked on as nonsense—and in
addition is perhaps more or less re-
pugnant. One purpose which an ex-
periment station may properly fulfill,
particularly in a state or section in
which there has been as yet no gen-
eral movement toward the better dis-
posal of city wastes, is to exemplify
to city engineers and other city offi-
cials and to local health officers the
operation of all the successful sewage
treatment processes and devices ap-
plicable to the region. In this way
the Station may render a direct and
valuable service to such municipalities
of the State as may be confronted, at
any time, with the problem of sew-
age disposal.
From the scientific standpoint, by
far the most important purpose of the
station will be to offer opportunities
for research in sanitary engineering.
Particularly, in the field of sewage
disposal it is now evident that there
are many directions in which any im-
portant extension of our knowledge
through the careful and painstaking
study of underlying biological, and
physical and chemical principles, is
likely to come, and then through the
experimental adjustment of engineer-
ing designs to these principles in small'
model plants, rather than by the hap-
hazard cut-and-dry methods that have
characterized much of the experimen-
tation of the past. The more thought-
ful sanitary engineers, the country
over, are proclaiming the need of
clearer and more extensive knowledge
in this field, and are urging upon well
equipped engineering schools the duty
of supplying it.
EQUIPMENT
For the purposes just outlined, the
Station will be equipped with fair-
sized working models of all the bet-
ter known and more reliable purifi-
cation devices, with a number of min-
or and supplementary devices used in
sewage disposal work, and with ap-
paratus for testing the results of the
various purification processes. Spe-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC.
cific mention will be made of some of
these in succeeding- paragraphs, with
brief statements concerning investiga-
tive work which may profitably be un-
dertaken with their help.
SEPTIC TANK
The septic tank is one of the best
known and most valuable devices for
the treatment of sewage. A fair sized
unit will be installed as a part of the
Station equipment, which will not on-
ly illustrate the septic tank process,
but which in addition will permit spe-
cial studies to be made of sludge di-
gestion; gas formation; efficient in-
let and outlet arrangements; best
means of baffling the flow, in order
to counteract temperature changes in
the sewage; most profitable detention
period; and the character and amount
■of residual sludge, and means of dis-
posing of it.
IMHOFF TANK
The Imhoff tank is a relatively new
•device for the separation of the sludge
from sewage and the digestion of its
organic constituents. Originally de-
veloped in Germany, the idea has been
imported' to America where it has
been exemplified in a few municipal
disposal plants. The new device, al-
though promising well for the future,
needs to be rigorously tested out un-
der American conditions before its
advantages, as well as its limitations,
can be fully known. The small unit
included in the Experiment Station
equipment is carefully designed with
this purpose in view. By means- of it,
studies can be made of sludge diges-
tion; the most efficient period of flow
for the raw sewage; the most profit-
able detention period for the sludge;
the nature and extent of gas forma-
tion; best methods of drying and dis-
posing of the residual sludge: and
some other questions bearing upon the
■economic design of large scale plants.
CONTACT FILTERS
One of the most adaptable and re-
liable engineering devices for the pur-
ification of sewage is the contact filter.
In this device the sewage is very thor-
oughly clarified and is exposed for
certain definite periods of time to the
action of scavenger bacteria, which
are colonized in immense numbers in
filter beds composed of gravel or
broken stone. Inasmuch as these fil-
ters are nearly always constructed
from local materials, and since climat-
ic conditions have an important bear-
ing upon the efficiency of their oper-
ation, it is proposed to build a typical
contact filter installation, consisting of
four units of primary and two units
of secondary filters, in which may be
tested local gravels of various sizes,
broken stone, coke, screened cinders,
and any other promising material that
may be found.
TRICKLING FILTER
The trickling filter, now common in
England and steadily winning its way
in America, is peculiarly susceptible
to climatic influences, being sensitive
to extreme cold. There is included in
the Station equipment a full sized
unit, set out entirely in the open, and
arranged in such a way that three
different kinds of filtering materials,
and two depths of each material, can
be tested at the same time under iden-
tical conditions. It is expected that
a considerable amount of investiga-
tive work will be carried on with this
filter, with reference to best methods
of distributing the sewage over its
surface, permissible rates of opera-
tion, maximum oxidizing efficiency,
most profitable depth, best size and
character of filtering materials, win-
ter operation, and the like. Arrange-
ments will be made such that the efflu-
ent from either the Imhoff or the sep-
tic tank can be applied to this filter.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC.
SAND FILTERS
Extensive areas in southern Mich-
igan are covered by the drift forma-
tion, which furnishes excellent oppor-
tunities for the purification of sewage
by intermittent filtration through nat-
ural beds of sand. This is the method
of sewage purification most commonly
employed in Massachusetts, where it
was originally developed. The bacter-
ial efficiency of the process is so high
and its general results so satisfactory
that it merits a thorough trial here in
Michigan where the .surface condi-
tions are unusually favorable for its
employment. Two sand filters will be
included in the Experiment Station
plant, by which different qualities of
sand or sand and gravel, varying rates
of filtration, and proper methods of
winter operation may be tried out.
OTHER PROCESSES AND DEVICES
In addition to the foregoing, facil-
ities will be provided for studying the
sterilization of sewage and of the
effluents from the various tanks and
filters; for studying the beneficial ef-
fects of aeration: for testing sludge
concentration by plain sedimentation
in specially designed tanks; for devel-
oping information regarding the
screening of raw sewage; and for in-
vestigating other special methods of
treating the sewage or of handling
the sludge.
RELATION TO THE COMMONWEALTH
With the concentration of popula-
tion in cities, the increasing pollution
of streams and lakes, and the rapidly
growing difficulty of obtaining ade-
quate and suitable municipal water
supplies, together with the marked
tendency toward the general accept-
ance of higher standards of municipal
no less than of personal conduct, the
impending problems of public sanita-
tion loom large and insistent. There
must be an increased volume of re-
search and much painstaking experi-
mentation if the sanitarian of the fu-
ture is to be fully equipped for this
great work. Toward this better
knowledge for the future, no less than
to more immediate objects, the Exper-
iment Station will be able to contri-
bute.

THE QUEBEC BRIDGE INQUIRY
Extracts From Report of the Royal Commission, by Professor C.J. lilden
THE FAILURE of the Quebec
Bridge, in August, 1907, re-
sulting in the loss of some sev-
enty lives and millions of dollars of
property, startled the engineering
world. The bridge was nearly half
finished. There was no natural dis-
turbance—storm, earthquake or hur-
ricane—that could account for the ac-
cident; the collapse came at the end of
a quiet summer dav. Everyone asked,
"Why?"
A Royal Commission, appointed at
once by the King, through his minis-
ters in Canada, made a searching in-
vestigation into the causes of the dis-
aster. Witnesses were examined in
great detail, and all phases of the cat-
astrophe were thoroughly probed.
The results of the study were printed
widely in the technical press, and ul-
timately published by the Canadian
government, in two large quarto vol-
umes. From these volumes the ex-
ceqHs given below have been selected.
Findings of the Commissioners.1
(a) The collapse of the Quebec
bridge resulted from the failure of
the lower chord in the anchor arm
near the main pier. (Marked "X" in
subjoined sketch. — Ed. Technic.)
The failure of these chords was due
to their defective design.
(b) The stresses that caused the
failure were not due to abnormal
weather conditions or accidents, but
were such as might be expected in the
regular course of erection.
(c) The design of the chord that
failed was made by Mr. P. L. Szlap-
ka, the designing engineer of the
Phoenix Bridge Co.
(d) This design was examined and

quiry. Vol. 1, page 9.
officially approved by Mr. Theodore
Cooper, consulting engineer of the
Quebec Bridge and Railroad Co.
(e) The failure cannot be attrib-
uted directly to any cause other than
error in judgment on the part of these
two engineers.
(f) These errors of judgment can-
not be attributed either to lack of com-
mon professional knowledge, to neg-
lect of duty, or to a desire to econ-
omize. The ability of the two engi-
neers was tried in one of the most
difficult problems of the day and prov-
ed to be insufficient for the task.
(g) We do not consider that the
specifications for the work were satis-
factory or sufficient, the unit stresses
in particular being higher than any
established by past practice. The spe-
cifications were accepted without pro-
test by all interested.
From testimony of Mr. Cooper.
(Q)2 Please state what qualifica-
tions in the way of training, age and
experience were necessary to make a
man fit to have supreme local control
of the erection of this necessary
bridge and whether any other staff
employed by either the Quebec Bridge
Co. or the Phoenix Bridge Co, had
these necessary qualifications?—A.
For a man to be qualified, in my opin-
ion, to have the supreme local control
of the erection of a bridge as impor-
tant as that under consideration. I
think he should have been a thorough-
ly technically educated and experi-
enced bridge engineer. I regret to
say that I do not think the chief engi-
neer of the Quebec Bridge Co.
had these qualifications. In reference
to the local control by the Phoenix
Bridge Co. as stated before, I do not

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC.
think they had the quality of engi-
neers that the circumstances demand-
ed. In saying this I do not wish to
reflect in any manner upon Mr. Burks,
who sacrificed his life and who un-
doubtedly was a competent man in his
line of experience; but I do not un-
derstand that he had the thorough
training and knowledge of all the re-
quirements of this structure neces-
sary to fit him for the responsible po-
sition of the engineering representa-
tive of the contractor on such an im-
portant structure.
(Q.) Is it reasonable to expect that
emergencies of grave importance may
arise upon work of such character
and magnitude and could the local
staff of the Quebec Bridge Co. be con-
sidered to be reasonably complete
without including an engineer of suf-
ficient scientific training, age and
practical experience to be competent
to deal with any such emergencies?
—A. This is a rather difficult question
for me to answer. I suppose that in
the case of the Quebec Bridge Co.,
like all projects undertaken by men
not especially acquainted with the ne-
cessities, the engineering features of
any such great work, they were un-
able to make a proper selection. In
reference to the Phoenix Bridge Co.,
I think it was due to the fact that the
commercial branch of that company
gave more consideration to the push-
ing and completing of the work than
they did to the giving of due consid-
eration to the practical requirements
of such a great structure.
* * *
(Q)3 Do you consider that it is
wise practise when building a bridge
of novel character and unprecedented
dimensions to place the design of the
structure and of the method of erec-
tion in the hands of the mechanically
trained staff of a contracting com-
pany and, if not, why was this prac-
'Ibid. Page 32.
tise allowed in this case?—A. In an-
swer to this question, it is general
practise in America to have a mechan-
ically trained staff of contracting
companies prepare the working plans.
As a rule, no engineer could afford
to maintain a staff of such character,
and no corporation would listen to a
fee that would cover any such ex-
pense.
* * *
(Q)4 At what date did you first,
become uneasy about the lower chord
members?—A. On Aug. 8, 1907, up-
on the receipt of Mr. McClure's let-
ter, as I have before mentioned, nar-
rating condition of splices in' chords
7-8 cantilever arm.
(Q.) Starting from this date please
relate all circumstances in which you
were personally concerned up to the
time of failure, refering to all com-
munications that reached you and all
action that you advised?—A. I have
already stated and drawn your atten-
tion to the correspondence between'
the Phoenix Bridge Co., Mr. McClure
and myself, following August 6. On
the morning of August 29, on reach-
ing my office somewhere about 11125
o'clock, I found Mr. McClure at the
office. After speaking to him I passed
into my office and took up my morn-
ing mail among which was a commu-
nication of Mr. McClure narrating
the condition of chord 9, west anchor
arm. After carefully reading and con-'
sidering the letter, I called Mr. Mc-
Clure in my office and cross-examined
him to find out whether the facts giv-
en were actual or whether he had
been scared, and satisfied myself that
the data there was from actual meas-
urement and actual observation. I
said: 'It is very serious.' He said:
'Mr. Cooper-, they have moved out the
small traveller, but we have estimated
that it will not add to the strain on

square inch, but they are going on this
morning to erect more of the work;
do you think that is right?' I said:
'By no means right.' I said: 'Is Mr.
Milliken on the work?'—intending to
immediately telegraph orders to Mr.
Milliken to stop it. 'Xo,' he said,
'Mr. Milliken is not present on the
work; there is only a foreman pres-
ent.' 'Well,' I said, 'I do not know
whether a foreman would take a sug-
gestion from me or not; I will have to
telegraph immediately to the Phoenix
Bridge Co., for them to wire to the
bridge.' I said: 'Are you sure that
Phoenix Bridge Co., have the same
facts before them that you are pre-
senting to me?' and he said: 'exactly
the same reports have gone to Phoe-
nixville that you have now received.
That was confirmed by a telegram
handed me about the same time from
Mr. Hoare, stating that Mr. Burks
had received a telegram from Phoe-
nixville stating that this chord had
been bent before it left the shop.' Sat-
isfied that the Phoenix Bridge Co.
had the same facts I immediately tel-
egraphed them to 'add no more load
to bridge till due consideration of
facts.' I then said to Mr. McClure:
you must go to Phoenixville imme-
diately and tell the Phoenix Bridge
Co. that I do not want any delay such
as that involved in the discussion that
we have had heretofore on similar oc-
casions, but I want immediate action
to strengthen that chord and to pro-
tect the bridge. He pulled out his
time-table and said: 'Mr. Cooper, I
cannot reach Phoenixville before five
oclock.' I then added to the dispatch:
'Mr. McClure will be over at five
o'clock.' Mr. Berger went to the
Western Union Office at 12:16 p. M.
I immediately took up the problem of
how to protect and how to strengthen
that chord and made some sketches
which I showed to Mr. Berger. I
said: 'If the Phoenix Bridge Co. do
not themselves adopt some better
method I would suggest that.' At
nine o'clock I was called up on the
long-distance telephone, and Mr. Mc-
Clure reported that the bridge was in
the river.
* * *
(Q)° Where do you think that the
first failure took place and in what
manner do you think the bridge acted
during the fall?—A. Considering the
history of Chord 9, which is before
the commission, there is no doubt in
my mind that chord 9, west truss,
failed first, and after it passed a cer-
tain degree of flexure the lattice bars
in the centre of the chord were per-
haps what first gave way. To my
mind, the noise that the men first
heard was the explosion of the lattice
bars of chord 9 at the centre. Un-
restrained by the lattice the webs of
this chord undoubtedly buckled to-
gether as so many sheets of paper
crushed in the hands. When chord 9
had passed a certain point the lateral
bracing between that truss and the
opposite truss in that panel were dis-
abled from doing any staying duty.
It appears to me, then, necessarily
that the opposite chord 9 east truss,
must have given way even had it been
far stronger than it actually was.
With the giving way of chord 9 west,
immediately followed by the failure
of 9 east, the cantilever arm would
naturally deflect towards the river.
The evidence of the wreck, showing
the continuity and unbroken condi-
tion of the eyebar top chord, and that
the anchor towers and anchor bars
which were vertical in position be-
fore rupture were pulled out to a hor-
izontal position, indicates clearly to
my mind that the main towers must
have remained intact until this was
done—indicating that the main tow-
ers and the whole of the anchor arm
declined towards the river and down-
wards until either the main towers
slipped from their footings or the
"Ibid. Page 357-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC.
great strain of this long eyebar chord
produced the final rupture of the main
tower. That the mass of fallen mater-
ial moved several feet towards the
east was due to the probable action
and later rupture of the eastern truss,
which would produce a tendency to
drag the material towards the east.
* * *
(Q)° ^e would like you to sup-
plement, if you can, your reply to the
last question in your previously given
evidence?—A. You asked me wheth-
er I considered that the engineering
data at our disposal are sufficient to
enable engineers to design members
similar to those in the lower chord
with safety and economy. I do. While
] do not mean to deny the desirability
of far greater knowledge and study
experimentally of our compression
members. I feel that the fault in the
existing chords as shown by the re-
sults of the disaster, do indicate in
what manner these chords can be
made, as I believe, effective and cap-
able of doing the work they were in-
tended to do. I believe that if the
webs of the existing chords had had
greater strength at the top and bot-
tom, or. in other words, larger and
wider angles, and if the horizontal
web at the middle of these chords had
been inserted their full length, over
splices and all, this web would have
given these chords abundant trans-
verse stiffness in the horizontal direc-
tion, with the present latticing alone,
and at the same time would have al-
lowed access to all parts of said chord
for inspection and painting. Introduc-
tion of this intermediate web would
also have stiffened and protected to a
far greater extent, the splices during
the critical period. I do not mean to
suggest this form of chord as the
best or as the only form: this sugges-
tion is simply indicative of how I be-
lieve these chords could have been
■ I hid. Pase 416.
made abundantly strong and capable
of standing the expected strains.
* * *
(Q)7 Do you assume a full re-
sponsibility for the change in the spec-
ifications, and for the selected unit
stresses?—A. I assume the full re-
sponsibility for the changes in the
specifications and for the selected unit
stresses.
&amp; * 4c
(Q) What were your reasons for
adopting the unit stresses specified?
Please state the data upon which you
founded your conclusions?—A. First,
as stated before, I desired to give a
belter bridge withoue increasing the
estimated weight and for that purpose
T lowered the wind strains, increas-
ing the train loads and changed the
formula for the determination of the
nit strains. I took up the investiga-
tions of the original Pheonix design
for the 1.600 feet span, examined in-
to the sizes of the members and the
unit stresses employed in preparing
this design, such strains being made
and proportioned according to the
original Quebec Bridge specifications.
Looking at the figures I find under
cantilever arm, lower chord, that the
end panel at the tower contained 740
square inches and was being worked
to a unit strain of 21,100 pounds.
Similarly in the anchor arm the end
panel at the tower was l&gt;eing worked
to a unit strain of 21,100 pounds,
the fourth panel from the tower, an-
chor arm, to 20,580 pounds. As my
studies proceeded I tested the dimen-
sions of these members under the re-
quirements by an assumption of us-
ing as high as 24.000 pounds for the
dead load, and found that my design
instead of 21,000 pounds would have
21,400 pounds. In another case where
they had 21.800 I would have 21,200
pounds. In another case where they
: Ibid. Pago 40Q.


23
had 21.520 pounds I would have 21,-
200 pounds. That was my first study
to find out whether the new bridge
was going to be of proportionately
greater weight than the original plans,
and I found that I was going to- use
no higher unit strain than had been
used in the original first design.
I then took up the report of the
Forth Bridge, which I had read be-
fore, to refreshen my memory. I
found that Messrs. Baker and Fow-
ler, the engineers of that structure,
had adopted ten tons, or 22,400
pound, for the constant or dead load
and 6 2/3 tons, or 14,933 pounds for
the changeable or living load. While
it is not definitely stated the impres-
sion left by reading the report is that
these strains were employed in the
design of the Forth Bridge, and that
the working strain is about 20,000
pounds on the Forth Bridge, and that
aimed at for the Quebec bridge was
21.000 pounds. This I considered as
a fair comparison for the reason that
that Forth Bridge, as far as any evi-
dence has been presented, was con-
structed without any regard to the
camber requirements, without any-re-
gard to any such delicacy of measure-
ment of length of members as we en-
deavored to obtain in the ordinary
bridge constructed in America. I
therefore felt satisfied that the strains
I have adopted for the Quebec bridge
were undoubtedly within the strains
that were employed for the Forth
Bridge.
My experience for many years in
the study and examination of exist-
ing structures in the United States
on many of our railroads when struc-
tures were vastly overstrained from
the increasing trainloads (not infre-
quently double those originally dle-
signed) gave me great confidence in
the high unit stsrain when the loads
are definite and clear: in other words,
T have no hesitation in believing and
expressing my faith that two thirds
of the elastic limit of the material,
where positively known load is a
safe strain. But there is no case in
the design of the Quebec Bridge
where any such strain as two thirds
of the elastic limit could have been
expected. While a limitation was
placed in the specifications to restrict
the strain of 24,000 pounds for an
increase of the specified live load of
fifty per cent, this load is an absolute
impossibility on any railroad in the
United States, except where they are
carrying pig iron one way and ores
the other. It must be borne in mind
that the strains on the Quebec Bridge
were determined for heavy train load-
ing upon both tracks. I do not believe
that the actual train loads would cross
the Quebec Bridge, certainly they
would not exceed the requirements in
my specifications, nor do I think that
the working strains under practical
train loads, would ever exceed 21,000
pounds.
* * *
(Q) Did the unit stresses used in
the specifications exceed the then
accepted practice in bridge-building?
—A. Certainly, but this was an ex-
ceptional bridge of exceptional length,
and high strains were justified be-
cause the greater weight was that due
to the structure itself, and any small
uncertainly in regard to the live load
would be comparitively a minor fac-
tor.
* * *
(Q) Would the actual unit stress
in the anchor arm in the completed
bridge have been unprecedented in
bridge-building?—A. Yes, I believe
so, with the exception of the Forth
Bridge, the only bridge to which it
can be at all comparable.
* * *
(Q) Were the specified unit stresses
exceeded in the anchor arm, and, if
so, why were they permitted and ap-
proved by you? —A. The specified
strains in the anchor arm were ex-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC,
ceeded by reason of the weight of the
structure exceeding that originally
given me by the Phoenix Bridge Co.
as the weight of the bridge. Before
this increased weight of structure
was discovered the anchor arm was
practically built and erected. When I
was able to sum up the shipping
weights of the different members of
the anchor arm and obtain the weight
of the anchor arm as a whole, I found
that it exceeded the original estimat-
ed weight. There was no means of
changing or correcting this work. I
made an estimate of the increased
strain due to this increased weight
and found it to be about seven per
cent. In conference with Mr. Szlapka
at a later time he approximately con-
firmed my calculations in regard to
the per centage of increased load and
increased unit strain. Realizing that
there was no remedy and that this sev-
en per cent was not a fatal increase,
I did say to Mr. Szlapka, in effect,
that we would have to submit to it.


THE WORLD'S GREATEST BRIDGES
THE LONGEST bridge in the
world is the "Firth of Tay"
which spans the Firth of Tay
in Scotland. This is 10,779 fee* m
length and is of the Girder type of
construction. Another celebrated and
the next longest in the world is also
located in Scotland, spanning the
Firth of Forth. This bridge is 8,296
feet long and is constructed on the
cantilever principle.
When length of span and capacity
are considered, however, the greatest
bridges in the world are those over
the East River, New York: the
Brooklyn, Manhatten, Williamsburg
and Queensboro Bridges. The com-
bined cost of construction of these
four approximates $90,000,000, while
a good sized fortune is expended an-
nually keeping them repaired and
painted.
Of the above four bridges the
Queensboro is the only one not of the
Suspension type. Owing to the navi-
gation laws of the United States, it
was necessary for these bridges to
have a clearance of 135 feet above
high water and an open space in the
center of the river of 400 feet. The
suspension type of bridge adapted it-
self so well to the conditions thus
imposed that it was adopted and in-
corporated in the construction of the
other three bridges.
The Brooklyn Bridge was opened
for use thirty years ago and has been
in constant use ever since. The main
span is 1,595 ^eet&gt; 6 inches, and the
two side spans are 930 feet each. On
the bottom level are two railroad
tracks and two roadways while on the
upper platform are two elevated rail-
road tracks and a promenade. The
total width over all is 86 feet.
The Williamsburg Bridge was the
next one opened, December 19, 1903.
In this bridge the main span is 1600
feet, and the side spans are 217 feet
and 379 feet respectively. There are
two levels on this bridge also, six
railroad tracks and two roadways
located below, and two promenades
above. The width of the bridge over
all is 118 feet.
The Manhatten Bridge was the
next one thrown open for public use,
going into service December 31, 1909.
The main span is 1470 feet and the
side spans each 725 feet. The total
width from railing to railing is 120
feet. In addition to the centre road-
way there are four railroad tracks and
two promenades located on the main
bottom level, and above are four ele-
vated railroad tracks.
In order to eliminate the great
strain imposed on these structures in
Winter by snow load, a force of men
is set to work immediately a storm
starts and either sweeps or shovels
the snow off as fast as it falls. To
afford a firm, secure footing for ve-
hicles and horses, wagons go about
springling sand as the snow is re-
moved thus eliminating the possibil-
ity of a slippery surface. Also, to
avoid too much load being thrown on
any one spot, the elevated trains are
required to keep a distance of 1000
feet apart (centre to centre distance),
while the surface cars are kept 105
feet apart. The speed of the trains
and surface cars is limited to 15 miles
per hour.
It is difficult to realize how much
traffic is actually carried by the above
bridges. The daily count is enormous.
On December 28, 1911 the traffic dur-
ing 24 hours amounted to 9,964 ele-
vated cars, 19,790 surface cars, 15,-
559 vehicles, 618,558 passengers in
vehicles and cars, and 11,493 pedes-
trians. Of this number of people the
Brooklyn Bridge which has the great-
est traffic, alone carried 342, 227.

PROFESSOR LEWIS MERRITT GRAM
THE RESIGNATION of Pro-
fessor A. E. Greene, last July,
left vacant one of the most im-
portant chairs in the Department of
Engineering. The course in Struc-
tural Engineering had its beginning
and practical development under Pro-
fessor Charles E. Greene, one of the
most eminent structural engineers in
the country, and is today recognised
as one of the best schools in America.
Its alumni in prominent positions con-
stitute a large number.
PROFESSOR LEWIS MERRITT (".RAM.
Lewis Merritt Gram was chosen
for the chair because he was a grad-
uate of the department under Pro-
fessor Charles E. Greene, and because
he had had many years of experience
in both steel and reinforced concrete
construction. The growing impor-
tance of reinforced concrete in all
lines of engineering, makes it essen-
tial to materially broaden the work of
the department in it, while the struc-
tural steel work of the department
must be maintained at its old, high
standard.
Mr: Gram was born at Menominee,
Mich., July 25, 1876, and graduated
from high school in 1892. Working,
then, until 1897, he entered the Uni-
verstiy, and graduated in 1901.
After graduation he entered the
service of the American Bridge Com-
pany, as draftsman, remaining until
1903, when he became Assistant En-
gineer of the Massillon Bridge Com-
pany. The succeeding year he gave
up his position with the bridge com-
pany to become Structural Engineer
for A. Bentley &amp; Sons, contractors in
steel, reinforced concrete and general
building construction, in which posi-
tion he remained until 1908. During
this period he was identified with
much important work, such as the
Bour Building, and Secor Hotel, at
Toledo, the Pugh Building at Cincin-
nati, and the water filtration plant, at
Toledo.
After leaving this position in 1908,
he engaged in the design of the power
house and other structural work in
connection with the Toledo filtration
plant, associated with Mr. YViliam G.
Clark, Michigan, '64. From 1909 to
1912, the date of assuming duties at
Ann Arbor, he was engaged in pri-
vate practice with office in Toledo,
()hio. During- these latter years he
was retained as Structural Engineer
for the Toledo Board of Education,
on construction of the Jessup Scott
and Morrison Waite High Schools,
costing over $700,000 each, and on
several ward schools.
During the year 1911-12 he was
connected with Schenk and Williams,
Architects, in the construction of a
concrete building for the Toledo Fac-
tories Company, which cost about
$250,000.


27
Mr. Gram's experience thus covers
bridge work, structural steel design,
concrete design, contracting business
in both steel and concrete, and private
consulting practice. Added to these
qualifications is the important one,
from a University standpoint, that he
is $ Michigan man born and raised,
and was a student under the late
Charles E. Greene. Loyalty to the
University counts for much.
Professor Gram is a member of the
American Society of Civil Engineers,
and the Toledo Society of Engineers,
of which he was secretary 1904-11,
and president in 1913.
Enthusiasm in his chosen profes-
sion, splendid training and experience,
and charming personality will unite to
maintain the interest of students, and
will doubtless cause the group of
structural students to be one of the
largest in the civil engineering de-
partment.


ALUMNI NOTES
Interesting informa-
a city engi- tion is received from
neer in Arabia Charles F. Shaw,
who has been acting
in the capacity of City Engineer of
Busrah, Arabia, a town of 80,000, at
the head of the Persian Gulf. Shaw
graduated from the Department of
Electrical Engineering in 1911, and
left immediately for his present loca-
tion.
The brick which have been turned
out with the crude oil are far superior
to the old variety, but the Turks have
to "be shown" the fact before they
will make the change to them. Shaw
has a good opportunity, now, to make
this demonstration, as he has been
engaged to build the hospital, and res-
idence in connection, at Mussat, the
plans for which he is now developing.
Another problem is placed before
BUSRAH CREEK
Shaw's attention was first called to
the poor quality of brick used in the
buildings .in the vicinity of Busrah
This is the center of the date-growing
district, and the dried date palms are
used as the sole fuel for brick burn-
ing. But they make very poor fuel, so
that the brick are only half burned,
as a rule, and 50 to 75 per ceat. are
always cull. As the clay is of excel-
lent quality and nearly inexhaustible
in quantity, he set about the problem
of obtaining a better fuel. From a big
refinery, recently built at Monmorah,
at a cost of $10,000,000, he finally
succeeded in getting, at a reasonable
cost, crude oil.
Shaw by one of the shicks of Koweit,
100 miles south of Busrah, who de-
sires wells driven to supply the city
with water. Drinking water for the
city is at present brought by boats
from a creek, 15 miles distant, and
when winds are unfavorable the de-
lay in the trip sometimes causes great
inconvenience. From an examination
of the underground water, Shaw be-
lieves that an adequate well supply is
possible.
Shaw has asked that an assistant
be sent him as soon as possible. This
assistant, preferably a Michigan grad-
uate, must be familiar with steel and
reinforced concrete structural work.


He will probably be chosen and sent
out the coming summer. That there
is a need for this assistant in Busrah,
shows that work in the Orient is rap-
idly progressing, and is appreciated
by the nations.
With Shaw is Philip C. Haynes, of
the class of 1911, who is studying the
agricultural situation with a view to
extensive agricultural improvements.
Haynes is a native of the West Indies,
and has had considerable training in
this line of work. These men from
Michigan are situated in a part of
the world where little has been done
in Engineering, and where are won-
derful opportunities for utilizing the
resources of the region, and making
them of practical value to the inhab-
itants.
Several members of
ANDETHEIRN daSS °f 'I2' wh°Se
whereabouts names are familiar to
the present graduat-
ing class as well as that which gradu-
ated before it, have been heard from.
They are scattered from coast to coast,
and from all available reports are
making good in their chosen branches
of work.
"Steinie" Steinhauser and Howard
Harding are with the Rochester Light

with what they are doing.
Francis T. Letchfield writes that he
is located with the Thousand Springs

Tohn Schmutz, Assis-
™E LOSS of tant profeSSor of
PROFESSOR P . , ,. ,
john schmutz Surveying, who died
on February nth,
19I3&gt; was horn in Switzerland, fifty
years ago. He came to this country
when hut a hoy. Without much help
from others, he has made his way, al-
ways upward and onward. He work-
ed as a laborer in the lead and zinc
mines of Missouri. He undertook
one occupation after another, always
studying, always making friends and
always maintaining the respect of
those about him, but because he had
first to learn our language, he could
not exercise his natural talents for
some years. His early education,
however, had been thorough. His
ability as a draftsman finally attracted
the attention of engineers. He enter-
ed the service of the War Department
where he obtained some splendid ex-
perience. He prepared plans showing
the proposed improvement work for
the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. He
had a part in carrying out these plans
in the field. He also worked for the
Lake Survey and assisted in the pre-
paration of the plans for the develop-
ment at Sault Ste. Marie. He never
claimed to be an engineer, and said
but little regarding his long years of
study or his practical experience. Not
being able to attend a university in
this country, he completed a corre-
spondence coifrse in engineering
work.
Some ten or twelve years ago Pro-
fessor J. R. Davis was employed by
the state to make a survey of the Lake
St. Clair Flats. While looking for
help to carry on this work, his atten-
tion was called to Mr. Schmutz and
the work he had performed. Mr.
Schmutz was engaged by Professor
Davis, and for a year or more he
worked under the general direction
of Professor Davis and under the im-
mediate supervision of Mr. Fred Mor-
ley, formerly of the Engineering Staff
of the University of Michigan. This
gave Mr. Schmutz further opportun-
ity for study and he found Mr. Mor-
ley a willing and able instructor. A
few years later, when Professor Davis
desired to secure the services of a
competent draftsman to assist in the
surveying sub-department of the Uni-
versity, he naturally thought of Mr.
Schmutz. The service Mr. Schmutz
has rendered the University in this
capacity has been of great value. Re-
ing a student himself, he had a real
interest in the young men who came
under his careful supervision.
Although not a university graduate,
Mr. Schmutz was a man of education
and refinement. During his six years
of service in the Engineering Depart-
ment he performed the duties assigned
him in a way that will give him a last-
ing place in the memories of all who
were so fortunate as to know him. 11c
never asked for a personal favor; the
few requests he made were all in favor
of others even at the sacrifice of his
own prospects. The interests of the
University and the students concern-
ed him at all times.
Combined with his ability, his fair-
ness and his loyalty to the University,
he had a fund of humor which en-
deared him to all who knew him. Ad-
vice he gave with caution and the
serious questions which came to him
each day made a lasting impression
upon him. Regardless of his own
feelings, however, he was always
ready to cheer and encourage those
about him.
Thus he lived— a quiet, contented
man; an example that is not frequent-
ly found: a friend to those who came
for assistance; an advisor for those
in trouble; a splendid servant of the
State; an upright citizen and a man
loved by all who knew him.

The new Barton
the new Power Plant, of the
barton plant Eastern Michigan
Edison Company, is
now practically completed, and is un-
der operation. The dam and power
house, located near the waterworks
northwest of the city, was designed
by Gardiner S. Williams. The con-
struction work has required somewhat
less than a year's time. The clam has
a 28 foot head. At the turbines are
developed 2,200 horsepower, and at
the switchboard 1,500 kilowatts. The
total cost of the plant was about $250,-
000.
The completion of the new dam
marks only the beginning of improve-
ments planned by the company. In
the spring construction will be begun
on a 34 foot dam at Belleville, to de-
velop 5.000 horsepower. The Argo
Dam, in this city, will also be replaced
by a stone structure at some time in
the future.

STUDENT
ASSISTANT
PLAN
The pedagogical ex-
periment of the De-
partment of Mechan-
i c a 1 Engineering,
which consists in the institution of an
increased staff of student teaching as-
sistants to relieve professors of detail
and routine work, seems in keeping
with general principles of efficiency,
and bids fair to be successful.
The enlarged corps of assistants is
especially for the laboratory courses.
There are undergraduate assistants, at
$200 a year, who, as in the past, have
charge of the rolls and minor matters
in connection with the professor*s
class work. For the conducting of
laboratory work are chosen graduate
assistants, some at $400, some at $600,
according to the time they are requir-
ed to devote.
The working of the plan is well
illustrated by the case of the two
steam laboratory courses, M. E. 7 and
M. E. 8. The ninty students in them
are divided into eight squads. Two
and sometimes three work at the same
period, so that a single instructor
could not give each of them sufficient
attention. The two assistants, how-
ever, can watch them closely, correct
careless mistakes as they are made,
and so save the students' time, explain
the corrections on the spot, so that
they are remembered, etc. They also
review all notes and reports on the
tests which they have conducted, and
can read them with a full knowledge
of any peculiar circumstances under
which the squad may have worked.
And these assitants all work under
the immediate direction of the profes-
sors, so that the work is uniform and
regular.
The first advantage of the plan,
then, is that it affords the student
more intimate instruction and direc-
tion. The second advantage is that
it relieves the professor in charge of
the course of the routine and detail,
which tends to tie him down and dis-
able him for research and the broader
planning for his course which he
should do, yet leaving each course un-
der his single direction.
So far as the semester has progress-
ed the plan has met with success, and
if the general principles of efficiency
apply to teaching and pedagogical ad-
ministration, permanent success may
be expected. With competent assist-
ants the instruction is thorough, and
the criticism sympathetic. All instruc-
tion in any course is systematically
concentrated under a single planning
and directing mind, with the planning
and directing its one big duty. Sys-
tem in its business phase, and sym-
pathy in its human phase give the
plan promise. There is more promise
in it from the fact that recent plans
have attained a fine success. The
Freshmen Assembly and the Mentor
System have proved so important,
during the past year, as to be almost
indispensible, and this inspires our
confidence in the plan-makers. Like
these other new institutions we be-
lieve that the Student Assistant plan
will soon make itself regarded as a
necessity.

TESTS ON RO
BY IRA T.
FOR MANY years, the civil engi-
neering course at the Universi-
ty of Michigan has been con-
ducted with the emphasis upon the
theoretical side, only one two-hour
course being devoted to laboratory
work in this branch of engineer-
ing. At the beginning of the pres-
ent college year, however, a new
policy was inaugurated, and in addi-
tion to the theory, the student is now
given training in its practical appli-
cation. Courses are offered in practi-
cal astronomy, stream gauging, the
handling of hydraulic machinery and
the testing of materials of construc-
tion. It is the aim of this article
merely to give a short description of
the work being d&amp;ne in testing mater-
ials and, more particularly, the testing
of highway materials.
THE LABORATORIES
The testing materials laboratory oc-
cupies two large rooms on the first
floor of the New. Engineering Build-
ing. The first of these rooms is in-
tended for the testing of metal, wood
and concrete. It is equipped with
machines for tension and compression
up to 200,000 pounds capacity; torsion
machines with a capacity of 230,000
inch-pounds and transverse machines,
the largest of which can exert a load
of 20,000 pounds. This laboratory is
being used extensively in the engi-
neering mechanics courses and in com-
mercial testing.
The other part of the laboratory is
AD MATERIALS'
HOOK, 'I3E. '•
used for the testing' of cement, sand
and gravel, and highway materials. ■ It
is well equipped with cement Working
apparatus, sieves for the granulomet-
ric analysis, a drying oven, a steam
box for the accelerated test on jce-
ment, and the machinery for testing
highway material which will be de-
scribed in detail. It also contains a
uniform load machine which is ad-
mirably adapted to the testing of steel
and reenforced concrete beams. This
machine is designed for a maximum
size of twelve feet long by one foot
wide. The uniform load is obtained
from water pressure, the water being
confined in a chamber under the beam
and separated from it by a thin rubber
diaphragm and a series of loose steel
cross bars. The load is, therefore,
exerted upward while the reactions
are downward. The value of the re-
actions is computed from the meas-
ured pressure in a glycerine filled cyl-
inder at each end of the beam, the
pistons resisting the upward thrust of
the water under the beam.
The illustrations, A, B, C and D
show the laboratory from different
points of view. Fig. 1 shows the po-
sition and direction of the camera
when taking the photographs. .
THE HIGHWAY LABORATORY
The Highway Laboratory which has
just been installed is modeled after
the laboratory of the Bureau of Pub-
lic Roads at Washington. An enum-
eration of the various machines and a

MATERIALS
brief description of their methods of
operation may be outlined as follows:
1. A four cylinder Deval abrasion
machine for testing the resistance of
broken stone to wear. Five kilograms
of the stone to be tested are broken
into approximately 50 pieces and
placed in one of the cylinders of the
machine. The machine is then given
10,000 revolutions at the rate of about
33 r. p. m., and the loss in weight cal-
culated in percentage of the original
weight. All of the material that will
pass a 1/16 inch mesh seive is regard-
ed as loss.
2. A diamond drill which is used to
cut cores from brick and stone for
the hardness and toughness tests. The
drill proper is a hollow cylinder of
soft steel or brass about four inches
long with eight or nine diamonds set
in the rim of the cutting end. The
diamonds are set to cut a core 25 mm.
in diameter.
There is also another core drilling
machine which is designed for use in
prospecting and for determining the
character of soil in a proposed excava-
tion. This machine uses loose steel
shot which are forced to crush out an
annular ring around the core by means
of the blunt end of the bit.
3. A diamond saw for cutting the
cores the proper length. Instead of
actual diamonds such as are set in the
drill, the saw is made by peaning dia-
mond dust in a large number of small
radial slots in the periphery of the
copper or soft steel disc.
4. A ten inch lap grinder for the
facing off of the cores. Water and
fine emery are used for the abrasive.
5. A Dorry machine for the stand-
ard hardness test. It consists princi-
pally of a cast iron disc revolving in
a horizontal plane at the rate of about
27 r.p.m. The cores to be tested are
held perpendicularly against the face
of the disc with a pressure of 1,250
grams while crushed quartz of size
30 to 40 is fed constantly on the disc.
The average loss in grams per 1,000
revolutions is taken as the index of-
Fig. 1

in taking illustrations, A, B and C.
the hardness, and a coefficient of hard-
ness is computed from the formula
H — 20— I/3W7, where W is the av-
erage loss in grams per 1,000 revolu-
tions.
6. A Page impact machine for ob-
taining the degree of toughness of a
rock. Iii its simplest form, the ma-
chine is merely a device for dropping
a two-kilogram weight upon the core
to be tested from successive heights
of one, two, three, etc. centimeters un-
til failure occurs, the height of the last
fall, which is the same as the number
of blows, being taken as the coefficient
of toughness. The machine is driven
by a small motor which raises, by
means of an endless chain, an electro-
magnet carrying the hammer. At the
proper height, regulated by a hand
wheel, the magnet circuit is broken
and the hammer falls freely; the mag-
net is retarded by friction in the
guides and falls more slowly but is
ready to pick up the hammer at the
next half revolution of the chain. The
cores for this test should be 25 mm.
long and 25 mm. in diameter drilled
from the rock perpendicular to the
stratification and faced off at both
ends.

mill and crusher; Deval abrasion machine; and brick rattler, showing casing.
7. A small ore crusher which is
used to crush the rock into pieces of
about J 2 inch size.
8. A 25 inch ball mill in which the
grinding is done by two 20 pound steel
balls. One half kilogram of the rock,
as it comes from the crusher, is placed
in the ball mill with 90 cc. of water.
It is ground for 2l/2 hours, or by about
5,000 turns of the mill. The resulting
stiff paste is then pressed into bri-
quettes.
9. The briquette machine is design-
ed to compress the paste from the ball
mill. For this purpose a cylindrical
mould is used with a close fitting plun-
ger. About 32 grams of the dough is
sufficient to make a briquette 25 mm.
in diameter and 25 mm. long under a
pressure of 648 kilograms (about 1815
pounds per square inch).
These briquettes are then aged 20
hours in air and four hours in the
oven at 200 degrees F. The laboratory
has not yet received the Page cement-
ation machine so that the briquettes
are tested in compression.
10. The list of new machines is con-
cluded with the standard rattler for
the test on paving brick. The machine
consists of a cylinder 28 inches in di-
ameter and 20 inches long mounted on
horizontal axis. The cylinder is made
up of channels lined with steel wear
plates. The abrasive charge consists
of ten seven-pound shot and enough
one-pound shot to make a total of 300
pounds. Ten brick constitute the ma-
terial for one test. These are given
1,800 revolutions in the machine at the
rate of 29J/2 to 30^ r. p. m. The loss
of weight is then determined in per-
centage of the original weight. All
pieces of less than one pound are re-
garded as loss.
The machine is enclosed in a wood-
en casing four inches thick filled with
sawdust. The effect of this casing is
not only to keep the dust from spread-
ing but it also muffles the roar of the
tumbling shot.
All of the larger machines are driv-
en by a 20 horse power, constant speed
motor which, as is shown in the illus-
tration, is mounted on a column so as
to be out of the way.
Some results of tests on stone:
In the accompanying table are some
of the results of the past semester's
work in Course C.E. 39. The material
was obtained partly from the rocks of
the local glacial drift, and partly from
the stone brought into Ann Arbor for
building purposes.

In interpreting these results, it must
be borne in mind that the tests were
originated with the view of testing
the stone for water-bound macadam
road. From the tests, then, the low
cementation of, for instance, granite,
would preclude its use for road build-
ing; but the other tests of hardness
and wear show that it might make a
good wearing surface if an artificial
binder is used, and it has been found
in practice that granite chips make an
excellent road when mixed with a tar
binder. Another factor that should be
considered is that the tests are made
in a laboratory under practically con-
stant conditions of temperature and
moisture, while on the road the mater-
ial is subjected to wide variations.
Thus a specimen that shows up fairly
well in the laboratory may not show
up nearly so well out in the weather.
CONCLUSION
It is beyond the scope of this sketch
to go into detail as to the laboratory
work done in the Engineering Me-
chanics courses or in the scientific in-
vestigation of the strength and prop-
erties of materials. Considerable re-
rearch is being done by different per-
sons, and occasionally the laboratory
is called upon to settle a dispute from
without as to the relative merits of
different kinds of the same material,
or to help the manufacturer out of
some difficulty. It is unfortunate that
probably are too high owing to the
the average business man regards sci-
entific investigation with so much sus-
picion and is so slow to take advantage
of such laboratories as this. He seems
to regard a test as a last resort andxat
best a necessary evil, while the true
function of a test is to guide the de-
signer and builder, from the begin-
ning, to make the best use of his ma-
terial. It often happens that the cost
of a test would be saved many times
over in the subsequent manufacture
of the material. Dean Orton tells of a
company that started to make brick
with a new clay, with only a very has-
ty trial of the clay. They built and
burned three kilns and found that the
bricks in the kilns were so cemented
together that they could be separated
only by the use of dynamite. A lab-
oratory test carefully conducted would
have showed that the clay had too high
a per centage of bitumen, and would
have saved the company many thous-
ands of dollars.
In conclusion, a glance through the
back numbers of the Technic will
convince one that the Testing Mater-
ials Laboratory has proved its use-
fulness in the past. And a glance at
the activity there this semester will
leave no room for doubt as to its use-
fulness at the present time. It is also
quite certain that the laboratory will,
in the future, find a larger usefulness
in the work of the University and in
the service of the people of the State.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC.
THE EFFICIENCY OF HAND WELDS
BY F. N. MRNEFEE.
ASET of interesting experiments
on iron and steel welds was re-
cently conducted in the Univer-
sity Shops and Testing Laboratory,
with a view to determining whether a
All of the welds were made by Mr.
William Telfer under the direction of
Mr. W. R. McDonald, foreman in
charge of the forge shop. The coke
from ordinary smith's coal (bitumin-
weld could be depended upon to devel-
op as much strength as the remain-
der of the specimen in question, and
if not, to find out the ratio of the
strength of the weld to that of the
original steel.
ous) was used in making the heats
and in most every case more than one
heat was taken. The tests were made
by Mr. I. T. Hook and the writer.
The first set of bars consisted of
five %" bars of wrought iron and four


bars of mild machine steel, weld-
ed in the various fashions known as
lap, split and butt welds (see figure
i), with and without flux. At the weld
and on each side of it, the bar was
turned down to approximately
over a distance of 8 inches.
Contrary to expectations, every bar
broke outside of the weld when placed
in the testing machine, which indicated
that for this particular set of bars the
efficiency of the weld was 100% or
over.
Plate I is a photograph of this set
of bars with the measured diameter of
the welded and adjoining portions
noted below each bar. It is interesting
to note that in every case the diameter
elastic limits, and maximum stresses
are very nearly the same, but that the
elongation of bar number 4, is greater
than the others as in the case of the
unwelded iron bar. Reference to
Plate I again gives an explanation in
the comparative diameters of the
welds. Here, as before the heating
and working has probably driven off
the impurities and made a better grade
of metal with a higher elastic limit.
It is doubtful if the welds would have
stood much more stress, for in the case
of bars 5. 7 and 9 (Plate I) the seam
or scar of the weld was slightly notic-
able, whereas before testing this could
not be detected in any of the speci-
mens.

of the weld is larger than the diame-
ters on either side. Referring to Ta-
ble I, which is a record of the tests of
bars shown on Plate I, it is seen that
for the four iron bars, numbers 1, 2,
3 and 7, that their elastic limits and
maximum stresses do not vary great-
ly, but that the elongation of bar num-
ber 1 was 24.3% whereas that of 2, 3
and 7 was about 19%. This, of course,
was due to the fact that the welded
portion of the bar possessed a higher
elastic limit, (as shown by a compari-
son of their diameters) and a corres-
pondingly greater resistance to dis-
tortion.
In the case of the 4 bars of mild ma-
chine steel, numbers 4, 5, 8 and 9 (Ta-
ble I_and Plate I), it is seen that the
Inasmuch as none of the welds fail-
ed, a comparison of the efficiency of
the three types of welding was not
available from this set of tests. In
order to determine whether or not one
weld was preferable to another, 10
more %" bars were welded and turn-
ed down at the weld in such a way
that there was little chance of fracture
occurring anywhere else. Table II
gives the general dimensions and
physical properties of this set in addi-
tion to the same data covering three
bars of tool steel. For both the iron
and machine steel bars the maximum
stress applied was about the same as
in the test of the former set. The
elastic limit of this set of bars is mis-
leading inasmuch as it is probably the


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC.
elastic limit of the unwelded portion
and not that of the weld. The maxi-
mum stress being about the same indi-
cates that the bars whose records ap-
pear in Table I and Plate I, would
probably not have stood a great deal
more at the weld.
It would seem that the percentage
of elongation of the welded portion of
bars shown on 1'late II would be
smaller than that for the correspond-
ing bars shown on Plate I, while in
the case of the iron bars the figures
indicate the contrary. This is prob-
ably due to the fact that the breaks in
the iron displayed coarse material
that bars 3, 6, 10 and 13 all parted
along the welded surface, and that all
were machine steel lap welds, and that
bar 9, the lap welded tool steel speci-
men, failed partly by shear along the
welded surface, and partly by direct
tension. The lap welds of the soft
iron bars 5 and 11 apparently failed
by direct tension. A close examina-
tion of bars 8 and 2 shows, that while
the bars failed by tension, there had
been a decided slipping along the in-
clined surface of the split or cleft be-
fore breaking occurred, but that the
break was actually a failure of the
metal rather than of the weld. The

which was hard to match up and join
together to measure the elongation.
This, combined with the fact that the
width of the space between the reunit-
ed ends, was spread over 2 inches, as
compared with 8 inches in the former
set of bars, accounts for the high per-
centage of elongation. In the case of
the machine steel bars the nature of
the break and the finer grained mater-
ial made it easier to fit the pieces to-
gether and greater accuracy in the
percent elongation was obtained. It
will be noted that bars 3, 6, 10, and 13
give a smaller percentage of elonga-
tion for the welded portion.
As for the relative merits of the dif-
ferent welds a glance at Plate II shows
table indicates that there was little or
no difference in the strength of the lap
or split weld. It would seem to the
writer, however, that all other condi-
tions being equal, the split weld would
be preferable. It is a well known
principle of mechanics that steel sub-
ject to tension develops shear stresses
along oblique planes; and that steel
will usually fail by shearing along a
diagonal plane or an inclined surface
which forms a cup. This would indi-
cate that a union by welding along one
inclined plane, as in the case of the lap
weld would, when the piece was sub-
jected to direct tension or compres-
sion, impose a high shearing stress

v
along this plane, which would result
in a failure of the weld. However,
the difference would be slight in any
case where so many other controlling
conditions enter in, some of which are
the expertness of the smith, the fuel,
and the impurities in the metal. Any
one of these, if unfavorable, would
upset any rules one might lay down.
As for the flux, there was little or
nothing to indicate that one was better
than the other, or that any was better
than none at all. It is probable that
no one flux would give the best results
for all irons and steels.
The conclusion which may be drawn
is that ordinary wrought iron and steel
can he made to give a 100 per cent ef-
ficiency weld under proper conditions;
and that, as seen in Table II, a high
carbon tool steel may develop an 80
per cent efficiency.

SUPPLYING DETROIT WITH WATER
BY A. D. JAMIESON, *IOE.
IN SUPPLYING a city with all the
pure water needed, these are the
general requisites: an adequate
distribution system (which includes
the proper kinds and number of
pumps, and a carefully planned sys-
tem of pipes, and the maintaining
of constant service. When the city is
growing rapidly, there is the added
requisite of frequently increasing the
distribution system. In these are in-
volved many problems for the engi-
neer.
Detroit is a large city, and a grow-
ing city, and hence furnishes a fair
example of the general problems to
be met and solved. The number of
persons to be supplied with water in
the city and suburbs is approximately
590,000, and the average daily con-
sumption for the year ending June 30,
1912, was 186.6 gallons per capita,
which necessitated pumping into the
mains an average of some 115,000,003
gallons daily.
The water is taken from Lake St.
Clair, a small body of water about 20
miles in diameter, which acts as a
preliminary settling basin for water
coming from the upper Great Lakes.
It flows' from the intake crib, about
3,000 feet from shore, to the wells
and water gallery at the pumping sta-
tion, by gravity,having passed through
a settling basin on the way. . From
the station one set of five pumps sends
a portion of it into a system of low
pressure mains, while another set of
two pumps sends a smaller portion
into a high pressure system which sup-
plies a more elevated portion of the
city.
Elevation is the first thing to be con-
sidered, of course, in laying out a gen-
eral system of distribution. Detroit is
a fairly level city, the greatest eleva-
tion being only 72 feet in the High-
land Park district, which simplifies the
task. I*t is principally to supply this
elevated district that the high pressure
system is employed, as it is more eco-
nomical to maintain such a separate
system of mains than to pump into a
single system of mains at the greater
pressure necessary for this limited part
of the city. The initial pressure at
which water is pumped into the high
pressure system is 72 pounds per
square inch, while that at which it is
[jumped into the low pressure system
is but 54 pounds. The lowest pressure
at which water reaches the consumer
on each system is 25 pounds.
Friction is the second general con-
sideration in the distribution system.
The greatest loss from friction in De-
troit's "low" system is 16 pounds in
a distance of eight miles, which leaves
from the 54 pounds, an average pres-
sure, after taking out the loss due to
elevation, of 25 pounds. On the "high"
system, the greatest frictional loss is
19 pounds in a distance of seven miles,
at which point the consumer is left a
pressure of 26 out of the 72 pounds,
the remaining loss being due to ele-
vation.
Weather conditions give rise to an-
other list of difficulties however, which
are of greater moment because so ir-
regular and sudden in occurrence. It
is suggestive of the importance of
weather conditions that when, in win-
ter, the temperature is between 20 and
40 degrees the consumption is normal,
but when it drops to the zero mark
consumption goes up with a leap. This
is because consumers leave their taps
open to keep them from freezing, and
steam boilers everywhere—in homes
and factories and on the railroads—
require more water. In 1911-12 the
average daily consumption was 105.-
000,000 gallons, but on February 12,
the coldest day of the winter, the con-
sumption reached 147,000.000 gallons.


A 48-INCH PIPE CONNECTION IN FRONT OF NEW PUMPING STATION


19
In hot weather, at the other extreme,
the consumption often jumps thirty or
forty million gallons because consum-
ers use more for lawns, cooling pur-
poses, and bathing.
Breaks in the mains constitute an-
other source of difficulty, as they are
bound to occur, without warning, de-
spite the best of pipe laying and care.
The breaking of a main results in the
bursting of the ground or pavement
above, and this gives an outlet to all
the water in the main, not only that
being pumped from the station, but
that already in higher portions of the
main. The pressure, as a consequence,
immediately falls throughout the
"high" or "low" system, as the break
has occurred on the one or the other,
and the condition must be relieved at
once both to prevent damage to prop-
erty by the overflowing water, and to
avoid leaving wothout fire protection
the large district of the city affected.
In Detroit the time required to afford
relief is 20 minutes to one hour.
A break is reported at the pumping
station, construction headquarters at
the storage yard, and Engineer's office,
within three or four minutes from the
time it occurs, and the Civil Engineer
or Assistant takes charge of the situa-
tion at once. An automobile with four
or five men and the necessary tools
capable of making the run to an ex-
treme point in 20 minutes, is dispatch-
ed to the locality of the break. Before
reaching the break the foreman in
charge has consulted a map of the
mains, and decided what gate valves
to close. The pumps have already
been shut off, and when he reaches the
location of the proper gate he pries
off a man-hole and closes it. The
pumps can then be started again, and
only this small section of the main will
be without water while the pipe is be-
ing repaired. To locate the man-holes
to gates is often difficult in winter,
when thev are covered with snow or
ice, and the foreman must refer to his
"gate-book" for measurements from
the curbs, etc., before he knows where
they are to be uncovered.
It is often hard to locate the break
in the pipes, as the water may not
burst the ground directly above the
break, but often as much as 50 feet
distant. Good judgment on the part of
the foreman involves many things,
but he seldom makes a mistake in dig-
ging for the break where he concludes
it must lie.
In the winter time, breaks in service
connections through freezing are fre-
quent, but these are the lookout of the
private owner, and not of the city.
The most interesting method which
the plumbers use in case of freeze-ups
is that of thawing by an electric cur-
rent. On a cart they have a small,
gasoline-operated generator, one ter-
minal of which they connect with a
street hydrant or some other part of
the main appliances, and the other
with the faucet inside the house. This
melts the ice, and the pipe, if broken,
is mended.
Still another common problem with
which the Engineer has to deal is the
shifting of mains when street grades
are altered. The simplest method,"
but a costly one, is to lay a new main,
parallel to the old one and turn the
water into it before the old one is tak-
en up. In 1911 a 650 foot stretch of
pipe on Russell Street and North
Grand Boulevard was lowered to its
new position with the shutting off of
the water for only 83 hours. The
earth was first excavated from beneath
the pipe, with the exception of piers
of clay at intervals. When this had
been done the whole length, the piers
were taken out, and the pipe let down
to its deeper bed. The points of the
pipe were slightly sprung, and had to
be re-calked, but this was anticipated
and allowed for in shutting off the
water in the main. The method work-
ed very satisfactorily, and resulted in
a noteworthy saving to the city.
The Engineering Department of the


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC.
Board of Water Commissioners, of
course, has many other problems to
deal with, such as the electrolysis of
underground iron work, the theft of
water through fire services, flushing
of mains to remove sediment, etc. The
reason these are not taken up here is
that they would demand a longer
treatment than this paper will alow;
they are problems of which any study
must be detailed in order to be of any
value. As to their relative importance,
however, it can be said at least that
they are as vital as any of the more
general problems that have already
been considered, which goes to show
the extent of the Engineer's duties.

DEPARTMENTAL NOTES
Tests are being made
c^eS j» the M- E- labora-
on test torv on a newly in-
vented fourcycle four
cylinder gas engine, the chief peculiar-
ity of which is the arrangement of
the cylinders which are horizontal,
two directly opposite the other two.
The pistons of an opposite pair of
cylinders are tied rigidly together by
four. rods. One of the pistons is a
trunk piston of wide face to which
the connecting rod is connected by a
wrist pin. The other piston of the pair
has neither wrist pin nor connecting
rod and, therefore, to reduce the size
of the engine, is made of narrower
face. The other pair of cylinders is
arranged in the same way, so that the
four cylinder engine has only two
cranks and connecting rods. The
cranks are placed i8o° apart.
Another interesting feature of the
engine is that the inlet pipe carrying
the charge is within the exhaust pipe
so that, on its entrance to the cylin-
ders, the charge is preheated.
The engine being tested is 3^2" x
4" in size. Tests are being made to
determine the maximum power and
the gasoline consumption. Also tests
will be made to see if it will operate
satisfactorily with kerosene as fuel.
It is designed primarily for use in au-
tomobiles, and when so used will be
placed so that the axis is at right an-
gles to the length of the car.
Mr. Peck of Detroit is the inventor
and the engine will be manufactured
in Frankfort. Mich., by a new com-
pany organized for the purpuse.

students Navy has written to
President Hutchins in
regard to a plan whereby engineering
students of this university as well as
of other schools will have an oppor-
tunity to spend two months on board
a battleship. The plan is to offer two
months instruction, equivalent to one
summer school, to students who have
completed two years or more of col-
lege work. The work will consist of
instruction in engineering, gunnery,
navigation, and regulations and rou-
tine of shipboard life. The expense
of the two months course will be about
the same as that of one summer school.
Nothing definite has been determined
in regard to the idea but it will proba-
bly be worked into shape and offered
as a regular course in the university.
Dean Cooley is heartily in favor of the
plan. lie says that in his opinion the
discipline a man would receive would
be the best part of the course.

ALUMNI NOTES
Harry A. Snow, who
TSiVSO!™ graduated with hon-
INCANDES- h , .
cent lamps ors from the Depart-
ment of Electrical
Engineering in 1911, is with the Na-
tional Electric Lamp Association, at
Cleveland, O. This company does not
engage in commerce, but has for its
objects the art of incandescent lamp
manufacture, and the development of
the science and art of illumination.
The voltage of every Tungsten light
manufactured must be accurately test-
ed and determined before it leaves the
factory. The lights are all tested in
large racks containing sockets of dif-
ferent voltages of supply, such as 100,
110, 120, etc. A very definite rating
of the voltages of the lights are ob-
tained by inserting them into these
sockets. It is essential to have the
voltages thus tested, that the same
kind of light can be sent to the cus-
tomer from time to time.
Snow has charge of one of these
testing laboratories, and his work is
very satisfactory.
Burt J. Denman, of
with Edison the class of 'gg now
ILLUMINATING , . , Jy' c
company cmef engineer of the
Delray branch of the
Edison Illuminating Co., was recently
in the city, and gave some interesting
information concerning the plant with
which he is connected.
This plant is the third largest of
its kind in the world, and uses the
largest Sterling Boiler that has ever
been produced. The plant contains six
14,000 K. W. units, weighing 400 tons
each. Each unit develops, actually,
16,000 K. W., making the maximum
capacity of the plant 97,000 K. W.
The maximum load, which occurs dur-
ing the winter season about 5 :co p. m.,
has reached 65,000 K. W., indicating
that the plant has not yet been tested
to its full capacity.
A new 20,000 K. W. unit is being-
installed to run at 1,200 revolutions
per minute.
One of the big problems encounter-
ed in the design of this plant was the
ventilation of the generators. The air
used for this purpose was at first ex-
hausted into the boiler rooms, where
it caused a temperature of 150 de-
grees, so excessive that the men could
not labor in it. The process was,
therefore, reversed; the air for ven-
tilating purposes is taken from the
boilers, and after passing through the
generators is exhausted outside.
A very striking fact regarding this
plant is that for cooling purposes there
is pumped each day three times more
water than used in the whole city of
Detroit.
William a Davidson, of the class of
'12, recently become a benedict, passed
through Ann Arbor a few weeks ago
with his bride, en route to their home
in South Bend, Ind. Davidson is, at
present, superintendent of the Wood-
working Department of the Singer
Sewing Machine Co., in that city, hav-
ing been rapidly advanced since he en-
tered their employ.

One purpose of the
tECTURifs Engineering Society
a trial Lecture Course is to
interest the student;
simply to give him something he will
enjoy as an engineer. A second pur-
pose is to help the student; and this
purpose is threefold.
Any student whose mind is com-
pletely tied down to his hooks, draw-
ings or even laboratories is not getting
an education adequate for entering
professional work upon graduation.
He must make the principles and theo-
ries which he is learning connect with
the profession, must learn their appli-
cation in practice. Here is the first
instance in which the Society Lectures
will help him. The speakers are men
from the field, with facts and practice
at their tongues' ends. They use the-
ory in their practice, and here ex-
plain it, and the student sees where
and why.
The second way in which the lec-
tures are a help is in bringing students
into immediate contact with the per-
sonalities of men from the field. It
is a valuable thing for a student to
meet and talk with, after the lecture,
such men as C. A. P. Turner, who
developed the "mushroom" system of
concrete construction, Willard Behan,
of many years of experience, who
spoke on the management of labor,
and Howard Coffin, who has mastered
the business of automobile designing.
It gets a student into sympathy with
the actual work of his profession, and
acts as a direct inspiration.
In still a third way the lectures are
intended to help the student, and that
is in selecting his courses. Perhaps,
as a student, you have often wished
you might ask a practicing engineer,
"What selection of studies would you
advise?"' No one practical engineer
could probably answer it for you satis-
factorily. But when you hear speak
a large number, as in the Society Lec-
ture Course, you begin to frame your
own answer to the question from the
suggestions which each, in the course
of his talk, has handed out.
These then, are the advantages
which the lecture course offers. Some
students, it is possible, are too indo-
lent to journey to room 348 and spend
an hour once in two weeks. But to all
who are not, and simply have not
thought of the benefit which might
recur to them, we say : Open your eyes
to what is offered you, attend one or
two and try to get all out that there is
in them; then judge if they be worth
while. The Society would not go to
the thouble and expense of providing
this course were it .not worth while,
and that presumption should warrant
you in at least putting the course to
trial.
With the close of this
the bright side year the Department
of a loss of Engineering will
lose another of its
best men, Professor C. J. Tilden, of
the Department of Engineering Me-
chanics. His place will be hard to
fill, not only because he is a good man
in his subject—good men in any es-


25
tablished subject are always to be
found—but because he has grown in-
to the Department and the University
as a man can do only in the course of
years.
Professor Tilden has been a mem-
ber of the faculty since 1904, when he
became an instructor in Civil Engi-
neering. In 1906 he was made Assist-
ant Professor and in 1908 Junior Pro-
fessor in the same department, and in
1911, when the new Department of
Engineering Mechanics was establish-
ed, he was placed at the head of it.
Engineering Mechanics has since risen
to a place of importance in the college
curriculum. His work since coming
here has attracted considerable atten-
tion, and he is known to have received
several flattering offers, among which
was one from Harvard in 1909, and
one from the government in 1911. The
latest, which he has finally accepted,
consists of the chair of Civil Engi-
neering, at" Johns Hopkins University.
We voice the feeling of the Depart-
ment when we say we hate to lose Pro-
fessor Tilden; but we must also add
that we have nothing but congratula-
tions for him and for Johns Hopkins
University, at the same time. What
he has already done here will, of
course, remain. And, moreover, we
do not feel that we are losing him, al-
together, but that we are sending out
a friend from our midst to form a tie
with a great institution of the educa-
tional world.

THE NEW BARTON PLANT
THE NEW Barton Plant of the
Eastern Michigan Edison Com-
pany, recently put into opera-
tion near Ann Arbor, Michigan, is
located on the Huron River about one
and one-half miles above the city, and
adjacent to Pumping Station No. 1
of the Ann Arbor Water Company.
The power house is on the site of the
old village of Barton, plotted in 1837,
and from this village the Plant takes
its name.
The Barton Plant consists of an
earthen dam about 1700 feet long
containing in the neighborhood of
50,000 cubic yards of material; a re-
inforced concrete multiple arch spill-
way, about 206 feet long; and a
power house having a rated machinery
capacity of 1500 kilowatts. The head
acting on the turbines is 26 feet. The
dam creates a pond about 1-3 of a
mile wide in its widest section and
nearly 3 miles long.
POWER HOUSE
The power house contains two main
generating units of 1000 K. W. and
500 K. W. capacity, respectively, and
a 50 K. W. exciter unit. Each unit
consists of a vertical generator direct
connected to an hydraulic turbine.
The horsepowers of the three turbines
are 1365. 700, and 67 respectively at
the normal head. Two sizes of units
make it possible to maintain a high
plant efficiency over a range of plant
output from 200 K. W. to about 1800
K. W.
Figure 1 is a sectional elevation of
the power house and shows the gen-
eral relation of the various floors.
There are in the building five floors,
the Generator, Thrust Bearing,
Switch-room, Penstock and Trans-
former floors.
In each unit the generator rests on
the main or Generator floor, and the
turbines are placed at the elevation of
the Penstock floor, al)out 27 feet be-
low. The weight of the entire rotat-
ing part of a unit is carried by a thrust
bearing on an intermediate or Thrust
Bearing floor. This thrust bearing
consists of two flat plates, immersed in
oil and cooled by a constant circula-
tion of water maintained by a siphon
system. In addition to the thrust
bearing there are three steady bearings
on the shaft, one located in the gen-
erator frame above the rotor, another
just below the thrust bearing, and a
third, a lignum vitae bearing, just
above the runner.
In addition to the main generators
there are located on the Generator
floor the governors, governor oil pres-
sure pumps and tanks, the switch
board, motor-generator set, and, on
raised platforms on either side, the
lightning arresters. Below the Gen-
erator floor, at the down stream end
of the building, is the switch room
floor on which are located both the
high and low tension switching ap-
paratus all operated from the Gen-
erator floor. The lowest floor of the
building is known as the Transformer


9
floor, and at this elevation are placed
the banks of transformers which step
the power up from the machine vol-
tage of 2200 to the line voltage of
22000 volts. All these floors are
served by a 20-ton hand power travel-
ing crane.
The wheel pits are of the scroll
type, a standard design of the Consult-
ing Engineer, very similar in size and
general dimensions to those of the
Sturgis Plant on the St. Joseph River.
"By using this shape the wheel pit is
reduced in size to the smallest possible
compass, thus reducing the size of
the building and at the same time
allowing each unit to be in a pit by
itself so that in case of necessity the
water can be readily withdrawn from
each wheel separately without in any
way interferring with the operation
of the remainder of the plant." In
order to readily remove the water
from the pits two large, wooden head-
gates, hinged as huge doors, have been
placed in the upstream end of each
penstock.
One of the unique features of the
plant is the means that have been pro-
vided for taking care of water during
the construction and utilizing flood
water to increase the effective head on
the turbines. This is accomplished
by means of two sluiceways which
pass through under the power house
taking water from the pond and dis-
charging it into the draft tubes with
the effect of a nozzle, thus practically
gaining the theoretical velocity due to
the total head above. The sluices are
controlled by two Coffin cast iron
sluice gates, each 3' x 6', which are
operated from the Thrust Bearing
floor above.
On the West side of the Power
House a fish chute has been construct-
ed complying with State law. On the
top of this fish chute steps and rollers
are provided to enable row boats to
be taken from the tail race to the
pond above.
For the purpose of testing plant
efficiency, means are provided in the
tail race whereby a sharp edged weir -
may be used for the measuring of the
water discharged by the turbines.
THE DAM
The west 1700 feet of the dam"is
an earthen embankment. This em-
bankment was built up in thin layers,
thoroughly rolled and compacted.
Over about 600 feet of its length it
was found necessary to excavate muck
to a maximum depth of 5 feet. About
500 feet was constructed on coarse
gravel, and over this stretch a cut-off
ditch was made in the upstream por-
tion and filled with selected loam and
clay. The upstream half of the em-
bankment consists principally of loam
and marl with some gravel added, and
the downstream half is largely gravel
except for a thin layer of loam on the
downstream face placed for the pur-
pose of seeding. The embankment
does not contain a core wall. It is
paved for a short distance below the
water line on the upstream side to
prevent erosion due to wave action.
It is drained by a series of 4" tile
drains, 15 feet center to center, ex-
tending from the center line to the
downstream toe, at which point the
drains discharge into a ditch with a
measuring weir at the lower end.
By means of the system of drainage
used in this embankment a large sec-
tion of the downstream portion of the
bank is kept practically dry. The re-
sults accomplished with this particular
bank, in spite of the fact, that, due to
floods, it was subjected to its full load
shortly after completion, have been
very satisfactory.
A path on the downstream side of
the embankment, on a 10% grade,
affords a means for the taking of
canoes over the dam.
On the east end the embankment is
joined with the spillway by means of
a reinforced concrete, buttressed re-
taining wall. This wall has an average
thickness of 15 inches and a maximum




11
height of 32 feet. An 18-inch suction
of the Ann Arbor Water Company
passes through this wall to an intake
in the pond about 250 feet upstream
from the spillway.
The spillway is very similar in de-
sign to that constructed, in 1910-n, by
the consulting engineer of the Barton
Plant, on the St. Joseph River, for
the city of Sturgis, Michigan, and de-
scribed by the writer in Engineering
all of the same length being cut off at
both top and bottom at a uniform ele-
vation, lie elevations of the abutment
footings vary with the elevation of
the river bottom, but this variation is
cared for by changing the height of
the foundation ring which is a seg-
ment of a cylinder, circular in plan.
This allows a uniformity of from
work in the cylinders and affords an
opportunity for "construction" sluice-
Record, March 2, 1912. It consists of
a series of ten inclined reinforced con-
crete cylinders, supported by abut-
ment walls, spaced 20 feet center to
center, with the exception of the two
end cylinders which have a span of 23
feet each, and the outer halves of
which come to a full center. In hori-
zontal section the cylinder is an arc of
a circle having a radius of 12 feet. The
cylinders are 15 inches thick in right
section and have an inclination with
the horizontal of about 450. They are
ways through the dam. The cylinder
is capped with a heavily reinforced
concrete crest slab so designed as to
give a maximum discharge.
On the back of the dam, reaching
to within about 4 feet of the bottom
of the crest slab and extending to a
pool dam 40 feet down stream from
the center line, is a reinforced concrete
deck and apron. This deck and apron
averages 18 inches in thickness and is
heavily reinforced throughout. Below
the pool dam for a distance of 20 feet

the river bottom is protected by a
paving consisting of concrete blocks,
12 inches thick and 10 feet square, tied
together with steel rods.
The abutments of the dam extend
up above the crest for a distance of 8
feet, and carry a walk over the entire
length of the spillway. Flash boards,
3 feet high, are operated from this
walk by means of worm and gear
mechanisms.
In figure 2 is given a view of the
partially completed Spillway, showing
various cylinders at different stages of
development.

i
MODULUS OF ELASTICITY IN AMERICAN INGOT
IRON BY DEFLECTIONS
BY S. S.U'LSON AND V. N. MENEFEE
ADETERMINATION of the
modulus of elasticity, E, of
American ingot iron as com-
pared with that of cold rolled shafting
was recently carried out in the Ma-
terials Testing laboratory. The results
obtained in each case were so definite,
and the ratio of increment of deflection
to increment of load was so nearly
constant, that the report is reproduced
here as indicative of the refinement
much as there is always a certain
amount of settling of support-and
crushing of material at the point
where the speciman rests on the sup-
ports, which is measured as deflection,
and later subtracted as set, the device
shown in figure i was tried with very
satisfactory elimination of this effect
of crushing and settling.
The apparatus consists of two strips
of heavy strap iron "F", paralleling
one may reach with the present testing
laboratory equipment.
The specimens of American ingot
iron, two in number, were rectangular
in section, while that of the cold rolled
shafting was circular. In each case
the method followed was that of
measuring the greatest deflection of a
test piece, supported at its ends, and
loaded with a concentrated load at the
center. Then by substitution in the
formula d==WL3/48 EI (see Low's
"Applied Mechanics," page 114) the
value of "E" was computed. Inas-
the test piece and 8^4" apart, connect-
ed by a strip "B" which drops far
enough below the supporting frame to
allow the deflectometer to be inserted
directly beneath the test piece. The
ends of the frame "F" are bent and
drilled in such a way that the set
screws "S" may pass through and sup-
port them. The set screws thread into
the yoke "Y" and fit into punch marks
on the neutral axis of the beam, direct-
ly, over the point of support. The
frame "F" is not threaded to the set
screws, and is probably not influenced

by the slight movement of the set
screw when the specimen is bent.
An examination of the photograph
will show that the frame supporting
the deflectometer is independent of
everything except the neutral axis of
the beam just over the supports. The
deflectometer was made by Brown &amp;
Sharpe, and measures to 0.01 of a
millimeter.
Two samples of American ingot
iron were tested, each with a cross
section of .897 by 2.51 inches and a
span of 17 inches. The value of "E"
was practically the same in each case
and somewhat higher than that of the
cold rolled steel shafting, the diameter
of which was 1.687, and the span 17
inches.


A NEW FIELD FC
BY HARRY V.
THE ESTABLISHMENT of an
engineering school in the Amer-
ican college at Constantinople
has a peculiar interest to Michigan
men, as it is being carried to fulfilment
by a member of the Michigan faculty,
Prof. J. R. Allen. Although the writer
is really in possession of no accurate
details in connection with the project,
he has thought that a few bits of infor-
mation in regard to the growth of the
educational system of the Near East
(if system it may be called), together
might be of some interest.
During the last century there has
taken place among the Christian
peoples, so long oppressed by the
Turkish Sultans, a social, political,
and patriotic renaissance. This move-
ment was destined later to spread to
the Turks themselves. A number of
causes have contributed to awakening,
on one hand, the national conscious-
ness of the Christian nations of the
Balkan peninsula, and to bringing the
Turks, on the other hand, to a realiza-
tion of the necessity of an immediate
amelioration of their whole system of
government as well as of education,
and of a change of attitude toward the
other nations inhabiting the peninsula.
The general world movement tow-
ard democracy, and the missionary
movement, headed by England and
America, have been the first powerful
forces for Turkish progress.
Second, the rapid growth and
enormous expansion of the commerce
and industry of the world during the
last century have had an influence. As
the discoveries and inventions of the
last few decades have facilitated the
ti ansportation of goods, Turkey has
found herself more and more im-
portant from the commercial point of
view, favored as she is by her geog-
raphical position in the direct line of
&gt;R ENGINEERING
WANN, A. M.
traffic between Europe and the Far
East.
Lastly, the establishment of a num-
ber of western institutions of learning
has been an important factor. Pre-
eminent among such institutions are
those founded under French, German,
English and American auspices and
protection.
The establishment of these schools
took place at a time when the heyday
of Turkish power was past, and the
realm of the sultans was already in
the process of disruption. In 1821
Greece had regained her independence.
Her example was then followed by
Servia, and later by Bulgaria, Mon-
tenegro, and Roumania. Present
Turkey is inhabited, for the most
part, by the Turks themselves, but in
large part, also, by the remains of the
Christian races originally disposses-
sed by the Turks in 1453, which have
never withdrawn to their respective
folds. The empire is bounded on three
sides by principalities at present inde-
pendent, which have left thousands of
representatives on the old soil.
Outside the natural conflict of na-
tionality among the remains of the
Christian peoples in Turkey, racial
jealousy, the language question, and
the question of religion have all been
factors constantly to deal with in the
Eastern question. But the most
serious obstacle to the development of
the Turkey of yesterday was the al-
most total lack of any system of edu-
cation. The Turks were the masters
of the situation; it was their place to
provide the means of instruction, but
they have made it a point, ever since
their invasion of Europe, to keep the
peoples subjected to their power in
the most ignorant state possible. The
result was that when the Christian
races began their struggle for inde-
pendence, they were in no position to


*7
establish an educational system, and
they found it difficult to rise out of
their inferiority and weakness. Hence
they received the occidental institu-
tions with open arms.
Among the first of the foreign insti-
tutions founded in the empire was the
French lycee of Galata-Serail. Later,
German Gymnasien, English and
American secondary schools followed.
Three of the colleges founded under
American auspices are of considerable
importance, the Syrian Protestant Col-
lege at Beyrouth, comprising a literary
department, a school of medicine and
an engineering school, the American
College for Girls at Constantinople,
and Robert College, situated also in
the capital.
Robert College was founded in 1863
by Christopher Robert, with a view to
placing within reach of the inhabitants
of the peninsula, without distinction
as to race or creed, the advantages of
a liberal education, rather than with
the express purpose of preaching the
Gospel. The college has undergone
the influence of the missionary move-
ment only incidentally, differing in
this respect from other schools of its
type.
The career of this college in its
earlier stages was a checkered one.
Some sixty years ago, two brothers
named Dwight, born and raised in the
East, conceived the idea of founding
a school at Constantinople. Dr. Ham-
lin, an American educator living
there, shared the idea. For a number
of years, they had cherished the pro-
ject, but had found no means of
bringing it to fulfilment, for friends
in America to whom they appealed
affected not to see the necessity of
providing anything beyond a purely
religious sort of education for the
Orientals.
About the time of the close of the
Crimean W ar, Mr. Robert, who was
travelling in the East, arrived in Con-
stantinople. Having made Dr. Ham-
lin's acquaintance, he learned of the
school project, became interested in
it, and promised upon his return to
America to find the means necessary
to launch it.
There were other obstacles, how-
ever, no less difficult of surmounting
than the money question. The search
for a site, the formalities necessary in
getting governmental permission to
build, the overcoming of native super-
stition, and the political opposition of
France and Russia, occupied years,
and sorely tried the patience of the
founders. Meanwhile a small school
was opened near the present site of
the college, with three professors and
four students of American and Eng-
lish birth. Gradually, Armenians be-
gan to attend, and at the end of eight
years there was an enrollment of 72
students. It was only by a chance
remark by Admiral David Farragut,
visiting in Constantinople, that the
government, fearful of American
naval interference, was frightened at
last into granting the imperial "Irade"
permitting the construction of build-
ings on the site finally procured by Dr.
Hamlin. Since that event, Turkish
belief in the right of anything that
once exists to continue to exist—
"Adet," as it is called—has prevented
further opposition.
During the first few years of the
existence of Robert College, there
came only Armenians and a few sons
of English and American residents.
But the Bulgarians were not slow in
assuming the first rank, for great
strides toward independence had been
made in Bulgaria, and occidental edu-
cation was becoming so popular that
today nearly half .of the statesmen of
Bulgaria are former students of Rob-
ert College. However, after the es-
tablishment of the Bulgarian auton-
omy in 1878, new schools were
founded on Bulgarian soil, and the
number of Bulgarian students at the
college decreased noticeably, yielding
the numerical superiority to the


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC.
Greeks, who now form the predomi-
nant element.
The influence of the college on the
Christian peoples of the East has been
enormous, both on the practical and
on the intellectual and moral sides.
But what has been the attitude of the
Turks themselves toward occidental
education? It is true that at first they
were not very favorable to it. Before
the writer's arrival in Constantinople,
in 1909, only one Turk had ever been
graduated from the college, and there
were at that time only twenty Turkish
students enrolled. Two years later
there were sixty-one. Since the adop-
tion of the Constitution in 1908, the
Turks have come in increasing num-
bers, realizing the need of following
the march of European civilization.
A word in regard to the organiza-
tion of the college, and the daily life
of the students. The college is or-
ganized on the plan of the typical
American college, and directed by a
president, Dr. C. F. Gates, an Ameri-
can, and a mixed faculty of some sixty
persons, of whom about twenty-five
are Americans and the rest Europeans,
including Greeks. Bulgarians, Armen-
ians, Turks, Frenchmen, Germans and
Englishmen. All the principal lan-
guages of eastern Europe-are repre-
sented by separate faculties, and every
student is required to carry courses in
his mother tongue. French and Latin
are required, German is elective, while
the most important branch is English.
Every student must learn English first
of all, since all the courses, except
the mother tongues, are given in that
language. It is the language of the
dormitory and dining room, the class
room and the pulpit. It is not, there-
fore, surprising that with a common
language and a common life in a
school directed by persons of a neutral
race, the students of various nationali-
ties come to know, respect and even
appreciate one another. It would be
hard for a Greek to pursue courses in
a Bulgarian school, or for an Armen-
ian to study in a Turkish school, ow-
ing to the century-old hatred which
exists between and separates these
races. But they can come all to the
same American school, and by dint of
studying and reciting side by side and
playing the same games, they find
tolerance giving way to respect. More
than one boy has told the( writer of
his surprise at finding that the boys
of other races were not, after all, far
different from himself. The transi-
tion from enmity to friendship was the
result.
It is true that the situation is still far
from ideal, and that quarrels are fre-
quent, owing to racial jealousy. But
in spite of the prevalent narrowness
and childishness of the student, it is
incontestable that the school spirit at
Robert College is far better than that
at any other school in Turkey. Then,
too, it takes time to bring about great
changes; the neutralization of the
hatred and narrowness of so many
centuries is not the task of a day. The
progress already made is marvelous.
The first year of the constitutional
government in Turkey was a trying
one for educational centers. In al-
most all the schools in the empire,
teachers experienced difficulty in dis-
ciplining the students and in making it
clear to them that liberty is a relative
thing, and not one to be abused. For
them, it meant the permission to do
just as they wished—carte blanche. All
the foreign schools caught the infec-
tion. The symptoms were different in
different places, but the character of
the trouble was everywhere the same.
The students wanted more liberty;
they criticised their teaching staffs, and
wished to measure their strength with
their teachers on every occasion. Hap-
pily, this spirit was not of long dura-
tion, but under efficient guidance soon
manifested itself along another chan-
nel, that of competition among the
students themselves.
A feeling has grown in the minds of
men interested in Robert College that


19
the students were prepared for. and
would be highly benefited by, the op-
portunity to train themselves for prac-
tical lines of endeavor. Not only is
the intellectual field tilled to the proper
point, but the realization of need for
the development of the natural re-
sources, the building of railroads, the
installing of the proper methods of
irrigation, and the adoption of sani-
tary precautions is so great that the
establishment of an engineering school
probably marks the beginning of a new
era in Eastern education.
The students are of a promising
type, eager to learn and quick to grasp
the more cultural branches of know-
ledge, but lacking in practical training.
They are exceedingly fond of phil-
osophy, language, history and interna-
tional politics, are highly imaginative,
and intensely patriotic. These quali-
ties form an excellent foundation on
which to base practical training, but
tools and teachers must be provided.
The material is good, but in the crude
state. The men who transform these
students of the East from dreamers
into doers may well experience a feel-
ing of satisfaction, and are to be con-
gratulated upon the splendid oppor-
tunity which is theirs.


COAL STRIPPING
BY J. ROBERT liAZLEY, 'il E.
rpHE REMOVAL of any clay,
I rock or spoil banks overlying
veins of rich mineral deposits
has been termed Stripping. This work
has been carried on in the anthracite
fields of Pennsylvania, in an exten-
sive way, for years past, but at present
is assuming proportions heretofore
unthought of. Much has been said of
the Panama excavations, but right at
our own door, is a territory no greater
in extent than the Canal Zone, may be
witnessed rock excavations that
would, no doubt, far surpass in the
aggregate the output at the Isthumus.
both past and present.
For years this work was carried
on by hand, only the out—crop, or
portion of the vein very near the sur-
face, where the removal of only ten
to fifteen feet of clay was necessary,
having been uncovered. Then came
the advent of steam shovels and a
more general use of explosives, per-
mitting the removal of the upper
seams of rock. With the increasing
scarcity of coal, the improvements in
modern steam shovels, however, and
the realization of the completeness
with which coal veins can be removed
by this method, this work has reached
a point where it is of more than local
interest.
Thruout the Hazleton Section of the
Anthracite region are found the larg-
est coal strippings in the world. In
the main, the coal veins uncovered are
twenty-five to forty feet thick, the
cover being removed as deep as eighty
to one hundred feet on a ratio of from
four to one to two and a half to one—
rock to coal. For the most part the
veins have been mined by the under-
ground method—a system of slopes,
gangways and breasts or chambers.
It is necessary in the underground
operations for support of overlying
rock and earth that one half to one
third of the vein of coal be left in place
as pillars and so had no other way been
devised, this amount of coal would
remain forever in the bosom of Moth-
er Earth. Fortunately for the users
of hard coal this condition has been
overcome, at least where the overbur-
den does not exceed three or four
times the thickness of the vein.
At Lattimer, Pa., is the largest coal
stripping in the world, being about
500 feet long, 3000 feet wide and about
100 feet deep. This work is just about
completed after ten years of constant
digging with modern equipment. The
vein of coal uncovered was a virgin
vein, having never been mined from
inside or outside. At first thought
this would seem an advantage, and in
many ways it was, but the fact that
there was no drainage for the great
floods of water that flowed into this
mammoth hole from the surrounding
hills, was a constant problem for the
men in charge. More than once, dur-
ing the course of the work, were the
shovels inundated completely.
By far the larger number of veins
uncovered have been mined from the
inside. And so in the light of the fact
that the excavators used weigh from
seventy to one hundred and ten tons
it can readily be seen that some pro-
vision must be made to break down
the overburden so that the steam
shovel will not break thru into the
mines during the course of its work.
This is accomplished by blasting the
bank ahead of the excavator, the pre-
sumption being that if the shot (or
blast) does not cause the overburden
to break thru into the mines, that the
remaining rock will sustain the weight
of the shovel.
The Engineers in the office of the
coal company having decided, after


21
very complete outside and inside sur-
veys, that the removal of the over
burden will pay, the equipment neces-
sary for the work is put on the ground
and operations commenced. The
steam shovels used are for the greater
part Bucyrus and Marions, of the
seventy-ton type. These machines are
the result of best engineering practice
both from point of operation and con-
struction. The stresses and strains in
some of their members are almost be-
yond calculation because of the nature
of the cause—being mostly shock.
The excavators have three pairs of
engines—hoisting, crowding and
swinging engines, being furnished
with steam from large locomotive
boilers.
The material is deposited by the
steam shovels into dump cars of about
four to five yards capacity. These
cars are in trains of from three to
ten cars and hauled by small locomo-
tives of the twenty-ton type. It is
often a very neat problem in efficiency
to figure out what size and number of
trains to run to a given excavator. The
overburden is dumped from the cars
at points beneath which it has'been
ascertained that there is no underlying
coal. Oftentimes to get the trains to
such a point it is necessary to hoist
locomotive and cars over inclined
plane by the use of powerful hoisting
engines and a cable.
The supervision of this work would
no doubt come under the head of
Efficiency Engineering as in this day
of competition efficiency is the thing
most sought and the thing that an
employer demands. The work is most
interesting—new and interesting prob-
lems ever presenting themselves for
solution—problems which space will
not allow of discussion as this writ-
ing is given merely as an introduction
to the big work in excavation that is
now going on in the Anthracite fields
of Pennsylvania.

SUMMER CAMP
BY HAROLD G. MC GEE. I3E.
UMMER CAMP—if you have
never been there these words
represent a hazy someplace
where perfectly good work-paled
Civils go, to return black as Indians
and hard as nails. "But if you have

C. &amp; P. R. R., Bryants and Ingleside,
Grapevine Point and Northeast Base,
the cedar swamp and the hog-back
party out in the spring of 1877, dur-
ing the last month of college, Whit-
more Lake being the camp site that
year. As the camp period came during
the regular college semester, a special
provision was made to give men credit
in surveying to make up any loss they
might suffer from missing the regular
classroom work. Since then, camp
has been moving northward and occur-

road are not mere idle words, there
is not room in this whole book to tell
what the words "Summer Camp"
really mean.
A surveying camp for civil engi-
neering students was an early ideal
of the university. Prof. De Yolson
W ood, who was head of the civil de-
partment from i860 to 1872, made the
first plans for a camp and chose Prof.
J. B. Davis as his assistant, chiefly
because he was a man who could run
a camp. Prof. Davis took the first
ring later in the season, until now it
lies at the joint of the middle finger
of the mitten and does not start until
the first of July. The original period
of one month has been lengthened to
six and finally eight weeks, the last
change having taken place with the
class of 1910. when the camp was
made a part of the summer school.
In July, 1908, Colonel and Mrs.
Charles Bogardus gave the University
1,441 acres of pine stump land be-
tween Douglas and Burt Lakes in


23
Burt and Alunroe townships, Cheboy-
gan County, to which has been added,
by purchase, about 225 acres more. The
whole tract is known as the Bogardus
Engineering Camp, and the camp site
of the engineers is called Camp Davis.
The camp is located on the south
shore of South Fishtail Bay of Douglas
Lake. The tents are lined up in two
circular curves on the shore, a few
feet above the level of the water, with
"State Street" running between. The
kitchen and mess tents are on top of
a high sand bluff, almost above State
Street. Early in the season, when
is quite a trick to reach bottom when
diving from the end of the spring-
board. There are points in the lake
where the water is over sixty feet
deep.
Burt Lake, only about a mile and
a half away is 119 feet lower than
Douglas Lake. Half way between the
two lakes is a big spring 80 feet below
the level of Douglas Lake, from which
a trout stream flows down into Burt
Lake. As a trout stream, this creek
breeds more mosquitoes than any other
known body of water of like size. Why
all of Douglas Lake does not drain off
A FIFTEEN-FOOT DIVING TOWER HELPS
strawberries are ripe, climbing this
bluff is like going up the side of a
great shortcake. During the first few
weeks strawberries, later raspberries,
huckleberries run riot over most of
the sixteen hundred odd acres; so also
do poison ivy, mosquitos, and black-
flies. Every well equipped knapsack
carries a bottle of fly "dope" an aroma-
tic combination of lard and tar oil
which, liberally smeared over the
physiognomy seems to discourage the
blood-sucking propensities of the
black fly.
Douglas Lake, being of glacial for-
mation, has a steep bank, just off
shore, so that, while the diving stand
is in only about four feet of water, it
into Burt Lake is a question for the
geologist. The surface soil between
the two lakes is entirely sand, except-
ing the cedar swamp. There are,
however, two morainal ridges running
along the neck which separates the
lakes. One, on which the mess tent
is located, bears the graded right of
way of the old Cheboygan and Pel-
ston R. R., never completed, on which
it is planned to lay rails for tn dec-
trie road in the near future; the other
carries the "hog back" road.
At present, camp can be reached in
three ways: from Cheboygan, by driv-
ing fourteen miles; from Topinabee,
on the Michigan Central, nine miles;
and from Pelston, on the G. R. &amp; I.,


24
six miles. Daily mail comes via Top-
inabee, official camp address being
"Topinabee, R. F. D. No. i."
The University spends annually
about $2800 on the camp. It is in
general charge of rjie professor of
surveying who has assisting him all
but one of the members of the survey-
ing faculty together with at least two
or more student assistants. Most of
the routine camp affairs are admin-
istered by the students, a mess com-
mittee and the sanitary committee hav-
ing in charge the commissary and the
veying, determination of azimuth, ad-
justing instruments, and making camp
improvements. Last summer a har-
bor was dug and rip-rapped with logs
to form a shelter for the large camp
fleet of seven or eight rowboats. Ex-
ceedingly impressive dedication cere-
monies, made notable by the presence
of the battleship "Gaboon.*' now lying
in peace on the rafters of the office
tent, marked the opening of the har-
bor to navigation. In addition to the
harbor, a concrete cistern was built;
a water system piping water down

health conditions of the camp. Board
costs about four dollars a week. A
camp physician, who runs the store
during spare hours, furnishes attend-
ance free to any who may be sick.
For work, and play too, students are
divided into parties of eight men each.
Four men live together in one tent.
Assignments are given out by parties,
each party doing one thing until every
man has had an opportunity at every
job in the squad. There is one instruc-
tor to about every eight students.
The surveying work itself consists
of measuring the 6,000 foot base line,
running stadia traverses and peg levels,
triangulation, sounding, railroad sur-
and along State street was installed;
and the end of the season saw a con-
crete dark-room completed. These,
almost the only permanent improve-
ments in camp, together with a con-
crete floor for the "Michigan Union,"
form the record of the 1913 Civils.
There are few camp rules. No fire-
arms, no dogs; a bugle blows at six
in the morning and everyone must be
present at roll call at 6:20—state of
clothing not specified. The day's as-
signments are ready at this time.
Breakfast comes at 6:30; an hour
later, everyone is supposed to have
drawn his instruments and started for
the field. Dinner is due at 11:3c un-

less one happens to be out with a lunch
when it often comes earlier. At half
past four, work is finished, clothes are
shed, and the lake is "among those
present." A fifteen foot diving tower
helps matters. After the 5:3c) supper
instruments are turned in and there is
nothing to do but write up office notes
(everybody loves office notes), play
diamond make an interesting combina-
tion. Whenever visitors are in camp
the camp fire generally closes the
day's work. Both Prof. Davis and
Dean Cooley have promised to visit
camp this summer. Songs are the
essential part of the camp fire—the
fire only serves to burn up the excess
logs about the camp site.

hundred other things. Lights are out
at 9:30. Saturday afternoons, Sun-
days, and Fourth of July's, are sacred
to washing clothes, to ball games at

all work. There are dances twice a
week at Topinabee and Topinabee is
only nine miles away. After dinner
inter-party ball games have been insti-

chipped beef sandwiches and dill-
pickle lunches, unclosable traverses
and fretful office days, blistered heads
and ivy-poisoned feet, are lost in the
oblivion of Forget, and when only the
ball games and the camp fires, the af-
ternoon swims and the early morning
plunges, the friendships and reminni-
scences, remain, then camp stands out
as the best eight weeks of the best
four years of a Civil's life.

ALUMNI NOTES
IN BIG
SANITATION
ENTERPRISE
William G. Clark,
'84 E, a sanitary engi-
neer from Toledo,
gave an interesting
lecture before the Engineering Society
upon the subject "Construction of
Water Filtration Plants."
Mr. Clark has been intimately con-
nected with the Toledo water supply
problems, and was Engineer in charge
of the construction of the mechanical
Filters, recently added to the water
works system of that city. The ulti-
mate capacity of the Toledo plant is
60,000,000 gallons. Thirty-four units
each of 1,000,000 gallons per day
capacity, have already been construct-
ed. A clear water basin, of 5,000,000
gallons capacity, takes care of the
variations in the use of the water dur-
ing the day, and permits the plant to
be operated uniformly. Three gas
engines, of 15,000,000 gallons capacity,
pump the water to the filters, and
engines of a similar type run .the
generators for lighting the plant and
compressing the air, which is used, in
conjunction with a reverse flow of
water, for cleaning the filters.
Maumee River water is fed to the
filters. The turbidity of this river is
rather variable, running up to 4,200
parts per million during the high water
stage. The cost of operating the
Toledo plant has been placed at $5.40
per million gallons.
It is interesting to note that Mr.
Clark was one of the charter members
of the Engineering Society, when it
was started on a small scale, in 1880,
by about 12 men, the total enrollment
of the Department being then about
50. Meetings were held weekly at
which matters of interest to those tak-
ing Engineering courses were dis-
cussed.
Louis C. Sabin, who

a few clays in Ann
Arbor during the first part of April.
He is General Superintendent of St.
Mary's Falls Canal, and in charge of
the construction of the new locks.
These locks, when completed, will be
the largest in the world, not excepting
those at Panama. Their length is
1350 feet, permitting two of the larg-
est lake freighters to be locked at a
time; the depth is 25 feet. The ton-
nage passing through the St. Mary's
locks is the largest of any canal in
the world. As much freight passes
through this canal in a month as will
pass in a year at Panama.
Mr. Sabin. during his stay in Ann
Arbor, was elected an honorary mem-
ber of the Gamma Chapter of Tau
Beta Pi. This honor was conferred
upon him in recognition of the splendid
work he has accomplished in his pro-
fession since graduation, which has
brought credit not only to himself but
also his Alma Mater.

DEPARTMENTAL NOTES
Plans are being made
EXH^TORY b&gt;' the Seni°r En^i"
planned neers to give an exhi-
bition of laboratory
equipment and machinery in the Engi-
neering Department sometime in May.
probably during May Festival week.
The object of the exhibition will be to
show visitors, including students from
other classes and departments as well
as people from out of the city, all the
apparatus and machinery in operation
and to show what work can be, and is
being done in the department. It is
planned to have students in charge
who will operate and explain the use
and purpose of every machine and
piece of apparatus in the laboratories.
Other students will act as guides in
showing people through the Engineer-
ing Building. Not only machinery and
apparatus will be exhibited but also
drawings and models—in fact every-
thing in the department that may prove
of interest will be shown to the best
advantage. The exhibition will be
advertised throughout the state, and a
special effort will be made to get as
many people interested as possible.
The organization of the work is in
charge of a general committee with
sub-committees for each sub-depart-
ment. This will be the first exhibition
ever given in the department, but one
which has proved successful at other
universities.
The pumping test on
pumping tests the city's wells at the
completed J. B. Steere farm has
been completed.
There are six 8" wells and one 12".
Four of the 8" wells were pumped
continuously for thirty days and the
remaining three were allowed to flow
free. Measurements showed a total
flow of over 2.000.000 gallons of water
per day. This flow was practically
constant throughout the test, there be-
ing no decrease in the flow as the test
went on. After the pumps were dis-
connected at the completion of tire test
the free flow of the 12" well was
measured and the measurement show-
ed a flow of 676.000 gallons per day.
The water of the wells has been
found to be of a very good quality.
Prof. C. J. Tilden,
prof. c.j. tildenhead of the Engineer-
to leave ing Mechanics De-
partment has accepted
a position at Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity as head of the new Civil Engi-
neering Department there and will
assume his new duties at the beginning
of the next school year. His depar-
ture from this University will be
looked upon with a great deal of regret
by faculty and students alike, but his
new position will be better than his-
position here and he will doubtless
prove his worth at Johns Hopkins as
he has done at Michigan.
A new course in test-
?eBsWt,Cn°gToVdN !5 road mat"!ab is

mester for the first
time, by Prof. Rich and Mr. Badger.
Prof. Rich gives one-half of the course
relating to the testing of mineral road
'materials, such as stone, sand, brick,
cement, etc., and Mr. Badger gives the
other half relating to the testing of
road binders such as asphalt, tar,
paraffin, etc. Since this is the first
time the course has been given it is
not yet perfected, but will be next

MORTIMER E. COOLEY


DEAN COOLEY
The Engineering Society was
started back in the middle eighties,
and almost immediately became
prominent in the affairs of the De-
partment. One of its earliest activi-
ties was a non-resident lecture
course. Desiring to preserve in
printed form some of the lectures,
there were published in 1886, and for
three years after, a few each year
under the title of "Selected Papers."
From this small beginning sprang
the more imposing annual known
for a number of years as the "Tech-
nic" and later as the '"Michigan
Technic."
The success of this annual was
such that it was sought in exchange
by state engineering societies, and
for many years each subscriber of
the Technic received the publica-
tion of a number of other societies
without addtonal expense. The
Technic was sought by public
libraries, and its articles were freely
copied in the technical journals. It
constituted in some measure the me-
dium through which the results of
original investigation in the Depart-
ment were made public It differed
from most other college publications
in the respect that it was wholly con
ducted and managed by students
without faculty control or financial
support outside of the Engineering
Society. Its space was sought by
advertisers, and to such extent that
it* was possible to include the Tech-
nic in the annual fee of one dollar
charged to all members of the Socie-
ty-
Desiring to increase its usefulness
the annual was changed to a semi-
annual with even greater success,
and then a few years ago to a quar-
terly. But in making this last
change the management did not for-
see, or did not realize, the great
amount of time required, time
which could not well be spared by
students from their studies, partic-
ularly as the requirements for grad-
uation had been greatly increased
from 120 hours to 140 hours. Trou-
bles began and multiplied to such an
extent that teh new venture proved
more or less disastrous. A debt was
incurred, which at one time
amounted to $500 or $G00. But this
was carried by the Engineering So-
ciety, and efforts were renewed with
vigor by succeeding Boadrs to put
the Technic back on its feet. Their
success was such that the debt was
paid off and a small sum turned into
the treasury of the Society.
Flushed with victory ambition
was again let loose, this time in an
attempt to publish the Technic as a
monthly, but still without other aid
than could be given by the Society.
Desiring, however, to make some
use of the monthly in the English
classes, the part time of one of the
English instructors was given in a
supervisory way to the editorial
work. Again reverses were encoun-
tered, largely due to inexperience,
lack of advertising patronage, and a
sufficient number of articles to fill
its pages. It was really too much to
ask of students in addition to their


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
other work, and faculty members
were too busy to aid greatly.
This year the entire matter was re
ferred to a joint committee of stu-
dent and faculty members for in-
vestigation and report. The result
is a new Michigan Technic, this the
first number being offered you as a
forecast of its future. It has been
attempted to incorporate in it the
successful features of earlier Tech-
nics, avoiding the pitfalls of later
years, and it is confidently expected
that the plan elsewhere described
will prove successful.
One of the main features of the
new plan is the reorganization of
the Engineering Society to embrace
branches in civil, mechanical, electri-
cal and chemical engineering. As of
old non-resident lecturers will ap-
pear under its auspices. Each mem-
ber will be entitled to receive the
Technic as a part of his dues whicli
go to its support. This insures a
large circulation on the Campus.
With the friendly attitude of the
large body of engineering alumni,
its success financially seems assured.
The plan has been approved by the
Standing Committee of the Depart-
ment.and the faculty members of the
board of management have been se-
lected with special reference to their
fitness for the work. This year's
single issue will be followed next
year with three or four issues. It
is hoped to make the Technic a di-
rect means of communication be-
tween those of us holding the fort
here and those out on the firing line.
It is intended to prove worthy of
the hearty support of every alumnus,
to the end that his cordial interest
and support will be enlisted without
special solicitation.


In the death of Professor Charles Simeon Denison, the University
of Michigan lost a member of its Department of Engineering faculty
who has been aptly characterized by Dean Cooley as "a modest man,
a gentle man, a dignified man, a proud man, a zealous man. He was
zealous in the interests of the Department; proud of its achievements;
dignified in his resentment of any acts considered by him presumptous;
gentle in expressing his resentment; and modest fearing he might have
gone too far in the cehsure he intended."
Dr. Angell, his life long friend and admirer, said of him at the
time of his death: "He was a good man, and he came of a long line
of good men." Of this "long line of good men" he had every reason
to be proud. The family traces its lineage from Antenor, King of
the Cimbri, of the Trojan nobility, born about 1239 B. C, down through
Charlemagne and a royal line to Captain George Denison of Stoning-
ton, Connecticut, who came to America in 1631, and who achieved dis-
tinction for services rendered in Cromwell's army and in our own
Indian wars.
His grandfather, Dr. Joseph A. Denison, was a noted physician.
His grandmother, Rachel Chase, was a sister of Bishop Philander
Chase, and of U. S. Senator Dudley Chase.
His father, the Reverend George Denison, an Episcopal clergyman,
was a graduate of Kenyon College, a Protestant Episcopal School
located at Gambier, Ohio, where later he became professor of Mathe-
matics after having taken a post graduate course in mathematics at
Yale. His mother was Janet Ballock Ralston, a descendant of the
Ralstons of Falkirk, Scotland.
Charles Simeon Denison was born at Gambier, Ohio, July 12,
1849. When he was four years old his father resigned his professor-
ship at/ Kenyon College and accepted a call to St. Johns Episcopal
Church at Keokuk, Iowa. In this place beautifully situated on the
bluffs overlooking the Mississippi were spent the next eight years of
his life, at the end of which time his father died. His mother then
returned to Lockport, New York, with her family and here from the
age of 12 to 18 he received an excellent preparation for a classical
collegiate course.
While a young boy he exhibited skill to a remarkable degree in
the construction of his toys. At the age of ten he built a locomotive
with a train of cars and a track that were the envy of his playmates.
Soon after his return to Lockport he made a small stationary engine
of metal together with a boiler. This engine attracted the attention
of the head manager of one of the local manufacturing establishments
who had the machinery stopped for a few minutes while the engineer


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
and workmen gathered around to see the little engine run by steam
from the big plant. While still a school boy he made drawings for
a rotary engine. He had never seen one and was much disappointed
to learn he was not the first in the field.
He was obliged to leave his school work for a time on account of
ill health brought about by too close an application to his studies
and the lack of proper exercise. The outdoor work on local surveys
to which he devoted himself built up his health, and the experience
gained, together with his natural mechanical ability, influenced him
in his decision to adopt engineering as his profession.
At the age of 18 he entered the Norwich University, a military
school located at Northfield, Vermont, where he remained one year.
He then went to the University of Vermont at Burlington, entering as
a sophomore. Dr. Angell, who was then president, made him adjutant
of a company in military drill. In 1870 he received the degree of
Bachelor of Science and in 1871 the degree of Civil Engineer. His
Alma Mater also conferred upon him the degree of Master of Science
in 1874, and the honorary degree of Doctor of Science in 1907.
While at Norwich University he joined Theta Chi, and upon
entering the University of Vermont he became affiliated with Sigma
Phi. Later he became identified with the American Society of Mechan-
ical Engineers, the Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education,
the Michigan Engineering Society and the Ann Arbor Scientific Society,
now the University of Scientific Club. He was also an honorary mem-
ber of the students' Engineering Society of the University of Mich-
igan and of Tau Beta Pi.
His first practical experience after taking his degree of Civil Engi-
neer was gained with the Milwaukee and Northern Railway in Wis-
consin, where he was engaged in making the survey of a line from
Milwaukee to Green Bay. He remained at this work until March or
April of 1872, when he was called to the University of Michigan as
instructor in Engineering and Drawing, by James B. Angell, who had
assumed the duties of president in 1871. He rose through the several
grades to the professorship of Descriptive Geometry, Stereotomy and
Drawing, which was given him in 1885. In 1901 the Board of Regents
changed his title to that of Professor of Stereotomy, Mechanism and
Drawing. This title he held until his death, which occurred at his
bachelor quarters in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on Wednesday, the 30th
of July, 1913. He is buried with his father and mother, at Keokuk,
Iowa.
At the close of his first year at the University of Michigan he was
engaged with Rollin J. Reeves to survey the boundary line between the
territories of Idaho and Washington from the Snake river north
to the national boundary. This proved to be a very hazardous under-
taking and nearly cost the entire party their lives. The last fifteen miles
of this survey were run on flour diet. Thirty-five years later a resurvey


7
was made of this boundary. In their report of this survey the men en-
gaged say: "With the knowledge of the country traversed, as it is today,
one can but marvel at the persistence and hardihood of that party of men
who did not falter until actual lack of food compelled retreat."
Throughout his 41 years of service as a teacher he became endeared
to his colleagues and students alike by reason of his noble and gener-
ous disposition, his kindly feeling for all, and his sympathetic nature
shown in his solicitation for the welfare of others. His uniformly just
treatment of his students in all his dealings with them, and his eminently
fair criticisms so skillfully given could hardly leave any other impression
than that found to exist among the alumni along the Pacific coast who
were visited by Dean Cooley, Dean Reed and Secretary Shaw in 1909.
Dean Cooley says that the question most frequently asked of them on
this trip by the older alumni was ''Tell us of the little Lord Chesterfield,"
and he further says: "I knew then, as I had believed before, that Pro-
fessor Denison in his quiet, unobtrusive way, had stamped his charac-
ter on every one who had come under his influence while in the Univer-
sity. Something that was pure and sweet and good in him had gone into
the lives of these students, these old alumni, who asked: "Tell us of
Lord Chesterfield."
He was a member of the vestry of St. Andrew's parish for upward
of 38 years and served as its secretary, junior warden and senior warden,
which latter position he held at the time of his death. As a member
of the diocese convention for fourteen years and a member of the
standing committee of the diocese for ten years he rendered efficient
service.
All who knew him hold with the vestrymen of his parish that "He
was a loyal friend, and those who had the privilege of intimate acquain-
tance with him found in him the enduring basis upon which true friend-
ship rests, while these most of all mourn his loss, they chiefly have cause
for thanking God for the enrichment which that acquaintance has
brought into their lives."

THE HINGELESS ELASTIC ARCH
F. A. STEIGER
The problem of the hingeless elastic arch is generally solved by graphical
methods, which, though only approximate in their results, are more easily
understood and applied than any of the complicated analytical methods here-
tofore offered. In this paper the writer presents a method of solution, a
combination of graphical and analytical methods, which is at the same time
simple and accurate.
The solution of the problem involves the satisfying of three fundamental
emiations:
Ms/EI = o (i)
Msv/BI -o (2)
Msx/EI = o (3)
where:
s = length of any short division of arch ring;
M — bending moment at center of such division; and is assumed as the
average moment of the division, so that
'2,Ms = total bending moment along arch center line;
x and y are the coordinates of the middle points of the spaces s;
£ = modulus of elasticity, which is assumed to be a constant;
/ — moment of inertia of each section j.
Equation (I) Ms/EI = O, states that, as the arch is fixed in direction
at the ends, all changes in direction caused by loads must have a correspond-
ing change in the opposite direction so that the final result or summation of
all the changes is zero. Equation (2) Msy/EI = o, means that, since the
arch span can not change, the effect of each bend in the arch, as measured
by the horizontal change that would be caused in the span, must be offset
by a corresponding bend and change of span in the opposite direction, so
that the final horizontal result is zero. Equation (3), Msx/EI — o, means
that, since neither end of the arch can change its vertical position as com-
pared with the other end, the summation of the vertical effects of all the
bends, when taken over the full length of the arch must equal zero.
These three equations can be much simplified by the removal of constant
factors. The quantity / is not a constant if the arch ring varies in thickness,


but, by varying the length of the spaces s, the ratio s/I can be given a con-
stant value and so can be left outside the sign of summation in each equa-
tion, leaving, since F, is also a constant,
2M = o; 2My = o; and 2M.v = o.
Furthermore, the bending moment M at any point in the arch is the product
of H (the horizontal thrust) and /', the vertical intercept between the arch
center line and the correct moment polygon, which it is our problem to find.
That is, M = Hi, and, substituting this value of M in the equations, we have
^Hi-o; 2Hyi = o; 2 H.vi -.o.
or since H is a constant, the problem will be solved when we have satisfied
the conditions
- i = o; 2 yi = o; and 2 xi = o.
The equation 2 t — o can be satisfied for any moment polygon simply
by moving the polygon up or down to balance the 4- and — areas. 2 yi is a
function of H, its positive value increasing as the value of H decreases.
2.ri depends upon the position of the polygon with reference to the arch
center line, as indicated by the position of the polygon closing line. We
have then to determine the value of // and the position of the polygon clos-
ing line.
In the special case of a load symmetrically placed both as to amount
and position with regard to the middle point of the span, the closing line of
the moment polygon is parallel to the spring line of the arch. 2 xi does not
then have to be considered, since the centers of gravity of the + and — areas
are at the middle of the span, so that, when the polygon is in position ta
make 2i —o, the moments of these areas balance. We have then only to
solve for H to make 2 yi = o.
The solution of the general case, that is, when the load is eccentric,
can be greatly simplified by reducing the problem to the special case of a
symmetrical load. To this end, we superimpose upon the given arch AB
an identical arch A'B', so that the end B' falls upon the end A, and the
end A' falls upon the end B. Then, adding the eccentric loads, we have an
arch with a symmetrical load equal to twice the given eccentric load. The
H for this arch will be twice the required H, and the moment polygon will
have the same ordinates (from the closing line) as the required polygon.
Furthermore, two points of the required polygon will be located, as the
points where a vertical line through the center of the span cuts the polygon
for doubled load and its closing line will remain fixed. We will have then
only to collect the position of the polygon closing line to obtain the required
bending moment polygon.
To illustrate this method, let us assume an arch of 8o foot span and ten
foot rise of center line. The curve of the arch center line may be of any
form, but the writer prefers to make it conform to the curve of the moment
polygon corresponding to the given dead load.

For convenience we will make use of the following notation as indi-
cated in figure 3:

as to make s/I a constant. It is customary to substitute an arch into about

twice as many spaces as we have used here, but in this solution the number
of spaces is immaterial.
By the construction of a reduced load contour, we can find the dead
loads, which we assume to act on lines through their centers of gravity.
Let us assume a live load of 200 lbs. a square foot to cover the left half of

the arch. We now have given the form and dimensions of the arch center
line, and the amounts and points of application of the loads; we are to find
the bending moment polygon which is the result of the given system of loads.
In Table I, Cols. 2 and 4 give the loads on the points as numbered in
Cols. 1 and 3, and Col. 5 gives these loads combined. That is, we have
reduced our problem to the special case of an arch symmetrically loaded by
adding the eccentric loads at corresponding points. This gives us the re-
sults in Col. 5. which are the loads on either half of our new, symmetrically
loaded arch. Since both halves of this arch are loaded alike, we need con-
sider only one-half the span in calculating the polygon ordinates.
In Col. 6 are set clown the part sums of the loads in Col. 5; that is,
the first in Col. 6 is equal to the first in Col. 5, the second in Col. 5 being
added to make the second in Col. 6, and so on, so that the last in Col. 6
is the sum of the loads in Col. 5.
In Co!. 7 are the spacings, toward the abutment, between these loads,
and in Col. 8 are the products of Cols. 6 and 7.
In Col. 9 are the summations of the figures in Col. 8, made as in Col. 6,
but from the bottom up. It will readily be seen that Col. 9 is a list of the
bending moments in one half of a simple beam under this system of loads.
From these bending moments we can find the ordinates of a trial polygon,
by dividing the moments by any assumed H. Letting the trial H equal
100,000, the trial moment polygon ordinates, at the a points and at the cen-
ter of the span, will be as given in Col. 10.
In order to make 2 i — o, we have but to place the polygon over the
arch so that Pk coincides with Ak. Then
- (Po — Ao) = 2 !' = o.
We have now to consider whether 2 Yt —o, and if not, we must modify
the ordinates and therefore H to satisfy this condition. In the expression
%yi, y is any ordinate to the arch, represented in Fig. 3 by AO. We have
then,
s3i = r.40« = o.
but when Pk and Ak coincide, i — Po— Ao.
hence
2 (AO.Po — AO.Ao)=o.
or
2 (AO.Po)=2 (AO.A0)
but
Po-PO — Pc
and
Ao — AO—Ae
2 (AO.PO —AO.Pe)=Z (AO'—AO.Ae)
Since Ae and Pe are constants, we have
2 {AO.PO)— fV2 AO = 2 AO'— Ac'2 AO


From Table II, AO = 38, and for the trial polygon, PO =38.2912.
Hence, Ae=- 7.60 and trial Pc — 7.6582. The Table gives all other neces-
sary quantities and we find that
2.40.PO — P* 2 AO = 31.8052
— .4.- 2.40 = 30.907.1
This shows that the trial polygon ordinates arc too large and must be mul-
tiplied by 30.907.3/31.8092=- .97177.
Trial ft, 10.1525 X 071-7 = 9.8659 = true ft.
Trial Pe, 7.6582 X .97&gt;77 "= 7--I42 — true Pc.
Ae — Pe=~.60 — 7.442 — . 158 — distance of polygon closing line
above arch spring line.

100000/.97177 = 102905 -f = True H for doubled load.
True h, 9.8659+ .158= 10.0239 = distance of top of polygon above
arch spring line.
10.0239— 10.0000-—- .0239 = true center intercept «'.
From Col. 9, Table I, the center bending moment = 1.015,252, which,
divided by the true h, 9.865c), = 102,905.2 — H for the doubled load. Hence,
true H= 51,452.6.
Having determined the true H, we have now to find the true position
of a polygon which is the result of the given eccentric load and the // that
we have found, so that Xxi — o. Two points of this polygon are already
located, i.e., the crown and the point D (Fig. 2), 10.0239 and .158 above
the spring line. These points are fixed, for since the arch bending moment
and also the simple beam bending moment, at the center of the span, are,
for the single load, half that for the doubled load, and since H is also one
half, the intercept and ordinate at the center will be the same.


15
Table III is in two similar parts, one part being a calculation to deter-
mine the ordinates for the left half of a trial polygon, and the other half the
ordinates for the right half. These ordinates, figured as though the halves
of the arch were independent, are calculated from the given loads on each
half just as was done in Table I for one half the double loaded arch. In-
stead, however, of dividing the moments in Cols. 6 and 13 by an assumed
H to find the ordinates in Cols. 7 and 14, we have divided these moments
by the true H as previously found.

H equals 51452.6 rind dividing the moments at point // in each half,
which is the center point of our arch, by //, we get 11.4133 and 8.3185 as
the heights of the loaded and unloaded halves of our polygon, at the center
of the span.
These two half polygons formed from the ordinates which might be
calculated at the load point from the corresponding moments in Column 6,
if drawn starting from the fixed point at the center, .0239 above the crown
of the arch, will give a trial moment polygon having the proper H, but
which must be tried and corrected in position so as to make 2t.ri = o.
In figure II the full line represents the arch curve, the light broken line
the moment polygon in its trial position, and the heavy broken line the true
position of the polygon which we are to find.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
In the half trial polygon C^Afi, C\ equals 11.4133, being the center
height of the loaded half of our moment polygon as given at the top of Col.
7, Table III. Similarly in C.BXF. C\F = 8.3185.
The average of these heights CXG and CJ* is C1D1 = 9.8659 or the
center height of our full polygon above its true closing line AXBV This
checks with the center height previously found for our doubled load, and
shows that our closing line passes through the point on the center line. . 158
above the spring line, as it should.
In order that 2.W = o, the sum of the moments of the ordinates, from
the arch spring line to the moment polygon, times the x arms, must equal
the sum of the moments of the corresponding arch ordinates times their
x arms.
This follows because the intercepts i are equal to the differences between
these ordinates.
We will find these moments and compare them and then correct the posi-
tion of our polygon accordingly.

In Table IV we have set down the ordinates at the a points, as found
in Cols. 7 and 14, Table III, but have placed them in their regular order from
the left abutment.
In Col. 3 we have — 1.3894 and -J- 1.7054, being A .-/, and SB,.Fig.
II, found by subtracting the half polygon heights CXG and C\F from C\D
the height of the center of the polygon at Ct above the spring line. These
quantities being subtracted from and added to their respective half polygon
ordinates give, in Col. 4, the ordinates from the arch spring line A B to the
trial polygon.
In Col. 5 are the x distances from the left abutment to the ordinates
and in Col. 6 the products of Col. 4 times Col. 5.
The sum of Col. 6 is the total polygon moment = 3162.5278.
The relative arch moment is equal to the sum of the arch ordinates
times the half span, i. c, the sum of the mom. of the corresponding arch
ordinates (see fig. 1), is, 2 X 38 X 40 = 3040.
The difference between these moments 122.5278 is the unbalanced mo-
ment which we are to correct.
Our polygon moment is larger than our arch moment so the polygon
must be changed in position to reduce the ordinates (to the spring line)


17
which correspond to the longest arms, and since the polygon is fixed at the
crown and the closing line is fixed at point Dx the closing line AxBt must
swing on point D1 to the position AtlBu.
As the lengths of the ordinates from the polygon closing line AXBX to
the polygon do not alter (being determined by H and not by the position
of the closing line) then the amounts which the ordinates are raised or low-
ered with reference to the spring line are equal to the intercepts of these
ordinates in the triangles AlDlAll and Bfi^B^.
From our unbalanced moment 122.5278 we are to find the change in
the position of the polygon as indicated by the intercepts of the ordinates in
these triangles.
We will not take space to follow the mathematics but it can be shown
that these intercepts are equal to
Ms/2 2 J (2)
where M is the unbalanced moment, and z the distances in either triangle
from the center of the span D to the intercepts.
In Col. 7, Table IV, we have these z distances and in Col. 8 their squares.
In Col. 9 we have the triangle intercepts figured by the above formula (be-
ing the same for both right and left triangles), and in Col. 10 the true poly-
gon ordinates from the spring line A B obtained by adding or subtracting,
as the case mav be, the intercepts in Col. 9 to or from the trial ordinates in
Col. 4.
For convenience we have placed the arch ordinates in Col. 11 and by
subtracting these from the ordinates in Col. 10 we get the desired intercepts
i in Col. 12.
In Col. 13 we have the v 1 moments, and in Col. 14 the xi moments.
The footings of these columns show how closely these summations equal
zero. It is only a matter of decimal places to make them balance exactly,
and therefore satisfy the conditions of our problem.
This method contains no intricate formulas, and the work is all simple
arithmetic.
A little study and comparison will show that almost every step has its
exact check.
By the use of the present day calculating machines, or. if one is only
aiming at practical results, the slide rule, the work is very quickly done and
much time should be saved over the graphical method or the more intricate
analytical methods.
The example given has been worked out to four places of decimals in
order to show what exact results may be obtained, but for practical purposes
this is unnecessary. However, it is suggested that in finding the ratio factor
that determines the true h from the assumed h the work be carried out sev-
eral places as the problem is very delicate at thi point. That is, H should
be found almost to the last pound if close results are desired.
In Tables I and III the a points are included in their regular order the
same as though they were loaded points, and the loads are given as 000.
This is because we wish to find the ordinates and intercepts at these points.
Some writers figure the bending moments at the loaded points in which case
only the loads would be tabled. To shorten our tables we might omit the


TUB MICHIGAN TECHNIC
a points and as our polygons are straight from load point to load point
we could find the load point ordinates, and then proportion in the a point
ordinates. It will be noticed that except for the center ordinates we deal
only with the a point ordinates.
RESUME
To determine the bending moments in an arch of any dimensions we
would proceed as follows:
To the given live and dead load on one-half of the arch add the dead
loads (and live loads) at the corresponding points (including the a points)
on the other half.
This gives us the combined loads as in Col. 5 of Table I. Following
out the summations and multiplications as in Cols. 6 to 9 we get the bending
moments as in Col. 9.
Assume any horizontal thrust H that will give the trial polygon ordi-
nates by simply moving the decimal points in the moments. Or move the
decimal points and multiply or divide by 2 or 3 if necessary, and if it is
desired to make the ordinates about equal to the corresponding arch ordinates.
Having the trial ordinates at the a points we form Table II and get the
factors to apply in equation (1) and thereby get the correction-factor by
means of which we find the true H and the true height of the moment poly-
gon corresponding to our combined load.
We also apply this correction factor to the trial Pe and then by assum-
ing Pk to be placed over Ak we get the position of our true polygon for this
combined load and are able to locate the hinge points in the polygon and its
closing line on the vertical through the center point of the arch.
So far we have solved to make 2 y i = o when 2 »= o and have deter-
mined the true H for our given load which is equal to one-half the H which
we found for our assumed doubled load.
The eccentric position of our given live and dead loads as regards the
center point of our arch span determines 5 x % so we now tabulate these
loads, beginning at the center point and passing to the abutments either way
as shown in Table Til.
Carrying out this table as described for Table I we get the bending
moments as in Cols. 6 and 13 and dividing these by our true H (one-half
that for our combined load) we get in Cols. 7 and 14 a set of polygon ordi-
nates corresponding to either half of our arch but independent of each other.
These are ordinates down to horizontal closing lines parallel to the
spring line and by subtracting the center point ordinate in each case from
the height of the fixed center hinge point (as previously found) above the
spring line we get the distance from the spring line of the arch to the half
polygon closing lines in either case. These distances, subtracted or added
as the case may be, to the half polygon ordinates at the a points give the
distances or ordinates from the arch spring line to the a points.
The sum of the moments of these ordinates about either abutment when
compared with the sum of the moments of the corresponding arch ordinates
gives the unbalanced moment of our trial polygon and. by applying formula


(2), we get the change in each ordinate necessary to make these moments
balance.
Applying these corrections or changes to the ordinates from the spring
line to the a points, we get the ordinates or distances from the arch spring
line to the true polygon in its proper position.
The difference between these ordinates and the corresponding arch
ordinates gives the desired intercepts i which, when multiplied by our true H,
gives the desired arch bending moments.
H — Horizontal Thrust in any Moment Polygon.
h = Center height of any Moment Polygon.
Spring Line — Horizontal line connecting ends of Arch center line.
AO — Arch Ordinates from Spring line to a points.
PO — Polygon Ordinates from Closing line at 3 points.
Ak — Horizontal line through Arch at heght of average AO
Pk — Horizontal line through Symmetrical-load Polygon at height of average PO.
Ao~ Arch Ordinates from Ak line at a points.
Po — Polygon Ordinates from Pk line at a points.
Ae = Average Arch Ordinate—Spring line to Ak line.
P* = Average Polygon Ordinate—Closing line to Pk line.
a Points = Points on Arch Center Line at which it is desired to determine the true
intercepts i.
i = Intercepts between Arch Center Line and Moment Polygon.
x = Horizontal distances from left abutment to ordinates through a points.
- — Horizontal distances from center of span to ordinates through a points,

LOGARITHMIC PAPER
W. F. VERNER, M.E.
Logarithmic paper has been used for some time by engineers in ob-
taining equations representing the results of tests where several variables
have a bearing on the result. It is also used to obtain graphically certain
values in representative equations when other values in the equation are
known or assured.
The purpose of this paper is to explain in detail, how to use logarithmic
paper, and the method adopted in making charts to be used in connection
with the flow of steam in pipes.
The divisions of a logarithmic chart are laid off according to a logarith-
mic scale and correspond to the spacing on an ordinary slide rule. The
paper may be secured from dealers in mathematical instruments. It is of
especial service in solving equations by the aid of straight lines, which if
plotted upon common co-ordinate paper would mean a set of curves.
Let the simple equation PV— (RT) be considered first. This may be
written, log P + log V — log (RT), which is the equation of a straight line.
Part i of Chart i shows a portion of the plain logarithmic paper. It is
desired to obtain the value of one of the variables in the above equation when
the other two are known. The ordinates of Part 2 at the left are used to
represent values of "P" ranging from 1 to 10, and the abscissae at the bot-
tom to represent values of "V" covering the same range. If 45 degree
diagonals are drawn from the left and down to the right they will represent
constant values of (RT) from 1 to 100. It is then possible by means of the
diagonals to obtain graphically the value of "P", "V" or (RT) when the
other two are known.
Example:
Let "P" = 5 and "V" — 6 to obtain (RT). Pass horizontally along
the line representing the value of "P — 5 until it intersects the vertical line
representing the value of "V" — 6. The diagonal passing thru this intersec-
tion gives the product, or 30.
It is apparent that if (RT) and "P" are known the value of "V" could
be obtained. And if (RT) and "V" are known "P" could be obtained.
Diagonals of 45 degrees might also be drawn fronvthe left and up to
the right which as shown on Part 3 will represent the quotient of the co-
ordinates "P" and "V".
Part 4 illustrates equations containing two variables on of which is
raised to a certain power.
Line A is for x = y2 which may lie written log x = 2 log v. The slope
of the line is an indication of the power or 2 to 1.
Line B is for x — y". Slope 3 to 1.
Line C is for x = v8 Slope .6 to 1.


21
Line D is for x = .7854y2. which is the equation for the area "x" of
a circle of diameter y. The constant causes a shifting of the square line
downward as y2 is reduced in being equated to x by a distance of "ef" equal
to (i—.7854) on the logarithmic scale.
Part 5 represents a chart for determining an equation containing the
variables of Table 1. which is a table from the American Radiator Company's
Bulletin on Vento Cast Iron Heaters.

It will be noted that the condensation per sq. ft. per hour decreases as
the number of stacks is increased when the velocity is constant. Also the
condensation per sq. ft. per hour increases as the velocity increases for a
definite number of stacks. The greater the temperature range the greater
the condensation will be, other conditions being constant.


23
Therefore, we ma}' write
C is some function of v (/' — t)/N. (1)
or,
C times some function of N = some function of v (/' — t). (2)
It appears from the equation that the condensation per sq. ft. per hour,
"C", times some function of the number of stacks "N" is equal to the product
of some function of the velocity of the air in feet per second "v" and some
function of the difference between the final and initial temperatures(t1 — t).
Let us then assume "v" as an ordinate at the left of Part 5, Chart I:
(t1 — t) as an abscissa at the bottom; "C" as an ordinate at the right to locate
the "N" lines.
Take values from the tables such as given in Table 2.

Referring to Part 2 it will be noted that the 45 degree diagonals repre-
sent the product of "P" and "IV". On Part 5 a 45 degree diagonal drawn
from the left and down to the right will represent the product of "v" and
some function of (t1 —t) which will also be the product of some function of
"N" and some function of "C" (see equation 2).
Since the 45 degree diagonal represents the product of any functions of
"C" and "N" intersecting upon it and function "C" is represented by hori-
zontal lines then the "N" function lines must be vertical.
Locate the intersection of "v" and a corresponding value of (t1 — t)
as of Table 2 and draw 45 degree diagonals as indicated on the chart until
they intersect corresponding values of "C".
It will be noted that the "N" lines are vertical and spaced as the single
power. That is the distance between N = 1 and N = 4 is equal to the
distance between 1 and 4 on the abscissa scale. Therefore none of the
variables have an exponent.
Take the intersection of v—100 and (t1 —t)= 100. The product
equals 10,000. The value of "C" intersecting at this point is 1. Therefore
if no constant entered into the equation the "N" line thru this point would
be 10,000. It is evident then that some constant greater than 10.000 must


24
be applied to "N". The "N" line of value I crosses the 100 velocity line at
slightly less than 11,000. Knowing that the equation contains only an un-
known constant its value may be obtained by solution, or 10,870.
10870 NC — v (&lt;' — /). (3)
Table 3 gives value obtained from "Mechanics of Heating and Ventilat-
ing" by Meiers' for flow of steam in standard weight iron pipes at 70 lb. per
sq. in. mean pressure.
Table 3.
Pressure drop per ft. of pipe
in lbs. per sq. in. (Pt). .0014 .0035 .0055 .0027 .0037 .006 .004 .004 .004
Velocity in ft. per sec. (v). 50 80 100 60 60 60 80 69 56
Diameter of pipe in inches (d). 10 10 10 8 6 4 9 7 5
From the table it will be noted that the pressure drop increases as the
velocity increases when the diameter is constant, and decreases as the
diameter increases when the velocity is constant. It is evident then that the
equation must be of the form
K times some function of V
P, = (4)
some function of d.
K = a constant.
By plotting the values of "Pt" with "V", keeping the diameter constant,
a line will be secured whose slope will indicate a power.
Line A of Part 6 shows that "V" has the exponent 1.95.
Line B indicates that when "V" is constant "Pt" varies inversely as the
i.2ths power of "d".
The equation may now be written
P, = _- (S)
The equation could be solved for "K", knowing corresponding values of
"Pf", "d" and "V".
Part 7 illustrates the method of securing the constant K. The line
representing the diameters raised to the 1.2 power are obtained by laying off
a distance from 1 equal 1.2 times the lineal distance between 1 and the pipe
diameter line. Locating the velocity lines and proceeding in a manner as
followed for Part 5 the constant is found to be equal to .0000107 and tne
complete equation is
.0000107 VK
r&lt; = (6)
The pressure drop for 7" feet of pipe would be
.0000107 vmi
* = --— (7)
remembering that it applies only for a mean pressure in the line of 70 lbs.
per sq. in.
The equation with four variables will now be considered. In determin-
ing the proper size of a steam pipe to handle "w" pounds of steam per hour


27
at not to exceed a certain average velocity in feet per second it is neces-
sary to know the pressure and quality of the steam in order to obtain the
specific volume. The actual inside diameter of the pipe may be obtained
from the equation:
ir (F ws
= (8)
4-i- X J4-1 3600 v
Where
d = actual inside diameter in inches.
rc = lbs. of steam per hour.
s — specific volume or cu. ft. per lb.
v = velocity of steam in feet per second.
Chart 2 represents a chart which enables the graphical solution of the
above equation. The value of any variable may be obtained when the other
three are known.
To construct the chart the following method was used:
The ordinates at the left were designated as values of the velocity in
feet per second extending from 1 ft. per second to 1,000 ft. per second.
The abscissae at the base were used as pounds of steam per hour from
10 lbs. to 100,000 lbs.
The ordinates at the right were designated as values of the specific vol-
ume from . 1 cu. ft. to 100 cu. ft. per lb. of steam. A supplementary scale
giving the pressure corresponding to the specific valume for dry saturated
steam was added.
The next step was to determine the positions of the vertical lines rep-
resenting the diameters of standard wroght iron pipe.
Referring to Part 3, Chart 1, it will be noted that if a 45 degree diagonal
be drawn from the right and down to the left it will represent the quotient
of the values of "P" and "V" intersecting upon it.
The equation ir rf2/4 X 144 = vfs,'3600 v may be put in the form which
will show that the quotient of two of the variables with their constant will
equal the quotient of the other two.
W/S — 36ooirrf74X 144.? = \().(&gt;3Sd-/S
Therefore on the chart the diagonal representing W/V must be the diag-
onal representing 19.635rf2/'S'.
Since "5"" is represented by horizontal lines then values of "d" must
be represented by vertical lines increasing from the left to the right. It is
then an easy matter to locate the lines corresponding to the standard pipe
sizes.
Take for instance the case of a 6 inch pipe whose actual inside diameter
is 6.055 inches. Assume "zv" =1.000 and 'V — 10. Solve the equation
for "5*."
S" = 19 ■ 635^'/"" = 7 • 22.
Through the intersection of the horizontal line representing 'V = 10 and
the vertical line "vf = 1.000 draw the 45 degree diagonal representing the
quotient t&lt;.'/t,= IOO until it intersects the horizontal line representing
S = j.22. A vertical line drawn through this last intersection will repre-
sent the 6 inch pipe.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The other pipe lines are located in a similar manner.
Example—
A 200 H. P. engine requires 5.000 lbs. of steam (dry saturated) per
hour at 100 lbs. gage. What diameter pipe is necessary, allowing an average
velocity of 1,800 ft. per minute or 30 ft. per second?
Locate the intersection of the vertical line representing 5,000 lbs. of
steam per hour and the horizontal line of 30 feet per second. Through
this intersection draw a 45 degree diagonal from the right down to the left
and note where it intersects the line representing 100 lbs. gage. The inter-
section indicates that it will be necessary to use a 6 inch pipe.
Referring again to Chart 2 and the method as described above for
constructing the chart it will be observed that the equation was solved for
"s" in determining the position of the lines representing the pipe diameter.
This may be done in another manner similar to the method used in slide
rule operation. Suppose the equation were of the form w/v = d/s then the
1 inch actual inside diameter pipe line would be represented by the left hand
vertical edge of the chart. That is the 1 inch pipe pine would intersect the
specific volume of 1 cu. ft. on the 45 degree diagonal representing the value
of 1.0 for w/v or at A. However, as the actual inside diameter of a 1 inch
pipe is 1.049 inches it will be necessary to move A to the right to 1.049 or at
A'. In the equation the expression ig.6^d2 occurs. If we square the
diameter it will be necessary to double the distance from A or as we do in
logarithms multiply the log of 1.049 b.v 2 to find the log o f(i.049)2. This
will bring the point to A2 or 1.1004. As "d2" is multiplied by 19.635 it will
then be necessary to add the distance 19.635 which would locate the 1 inch
pipe line as indicated on the chart at A".
An equation arrived at by the author for determining the diameter of a
steam pipe in low pressure heating work between o and 3 lbs. gage using
constants as obtained from Luftungs und Heizungs Anlagen" by Reitschel
is used to construct the chart 3.
The equation for straight unobstructed pipe is
/ (* + *')h
d t= .0048 V
P
where
d = actual inside diameter of pipe in inches.
/ = length of pipe line in feet.
/t = B.T.U. (latent heat) required at discharge end of pipe per hr.
h = B.T.U. lost in pipe line per hour.
/&gt; = the drop in pressure in lbs. per sq. in. or the difference between the
final and initial pressure.
At the left are values of P.
At the bottom are values of (h -j- h').
At the right are values of h.
At the top are values of /.
These coordinates were so chosen as to give 45 degree diagonals inter-
secting at right angles. The equation it will be noted contains the expres-
sions h (h -\- A'), which is represented by a 45 degree diagonal drawn from


29
the left and down to the right, and IIP, which is represented by a 45 degree
diagonal at right angles to the h (h + h') diagonal. As these two expres-
sions are multiplied in the equation, the diameter lines will be vertical and
spaced according to the fifth power of "d" divided by the fifth power of
. 0048.
To locate the diameter lines values of /, h and (h ■+- h') were assumed
of such values as to make the solution of the equation simple. Take for
instance, the location of the 3 inch pipe line.
Let h = 1,000,000, (A4- h')— 1,000,000 and /= 1,000.
Then
1.000 (1,000,000)3
d -— .0048 V
P
or d/4.8 = l/P and P= (4.8/3.068)" = 9.3
Draw the 45 degree diagonal representing h (h + ft') or io12. Through
the intersection of the vertical line representing /= 1,000 and the horizontal
line representing P — 0.3 draw the 45 degree diagonal representing l/P.
The 3 inch diameter pipe line will pass vertically through the intersection
of the two diagonals.
Example—
Consider a pipe line 600 feet long which is to deliver 550,000 B.T.U.
per hour to a heating system. Initial pressure 3 lbs. gage. Final pressure
2 lbs. gage. Assume 30,000 B.T.U. lost in transit per hour.
h = 550,000
(h + h') = =80,000
/ = 600
P= 1
Draw a 45 degree diagonal as indicated on the chart through the inter-
section of the "h" line, of 550,000 and the (h -4- h') line of 580,000. Draw
a 45 degree diagonal as indicated through the intersection of the "/" line of
600 and the "P" line of 1 lb. The intersection of the diagonals show a pipe
size slightly less than 3M? inches. It will then be necessary to use a inch
pipe and the pressure drop will be less than 1 lb. To obtain this drop in
pressure draw a 45 degree diagonal l/P through the intersection of the

Much of the work done by an engineer, especially one who is an expert
in certain lines, is often the repeated application of certain formulas. Any
mechanical means for solving the equations which involve substitutions of
different variables means a saving of time and mental wear and tear.

PROTECTION
R. R. TINKHAM, '05 E
That a sea-wall itself should require protection from the seas may
seem to be a strange circumstance; however, such was the experience
of the writer w hen, on an exposed part of the Lake Huron shore, it be-
came necessary to devise and speedily construct a scheme of shore pro-
tection for the preservation of a sea-wall partly undermined and in im-
minent danger of destruction by action of the seas.
A system of groining was adopted and constructed with immediate
and satisfactory results.
The sea-wall is a familiar form of shore protection needing no com-
ment other than to point out its chief characteristics, viz.; that it is a
cliff-like structure placed along a shore front, replacing the yielding
shore with a hard material to resist the attack of seas; and, because of
the power of seas, it is necessarily a massive and expensive structure.
Groins are different in every way. They constructed intersecting
the shore line; they do not depend upon their mass and hardness to
resist sea action, but utilize natural marine forces as defense against
the power of those forces; they are comparatively light structures and,
therefore, less expensive.
To explain the use and application of groins, however, it is neces-
sary first to outline the forces acting on the forces acting on the shores.
The ultimate result of these forces is erosion, and by shore protection
is meant protection against erosion of the shore.
PHYSICAL ASPECTS
On large bodies of water, such as the seas and the Great Lakes,
there is no static equilibrium of materials composing the shore. There
is continuous erosion and continuous accretion with consequent move-
ment of materials. Sometimes conditions are such that accretion bal-
ances erosion and there is no apparent change in the shore. More often,
however, one predominates and there results either a cutting away ancLa
receding shore-line, or a building up and an increasing shore line.
The latter condition is rare when compared with the former, and results
only when certain physical characteristics are present, such as head-
lands and inflowing rivers situated where littoral draft is pronounced.
A notable example of accumulations around a headland is Tavvas
Point, Lake Huron. This point has extended three thousand feet in
length during the last forty years, and accretion is continuous.
The effect of a river flowing into the lake is to interrupt the along-
shore drift with resulting deposit above and opposite the mouth. Ero-
sion continues below compensating accretion and as this accumulation


31
above and erosion below continues, the mouth of the stream is forced
in the direction of drift, sometimes for miles until a firm shore material
is encountered. The Big Two Hearted River on Lake Superior, and
Snake River on Lake Michigan illustrate this action.
EROSIVE AND TRANSLATORY FORCES
The principal forces acting on shores may be designated as,
A. Elements.
B. Waves.
C. Currents.
A. Elements.
The elementary agents of erosion are wind, frost, rain and land
springs. The action of these forces is generally well known and little
need be said concerning them. The inland observer, however, cannot
have experienced the maximum fore of wind attained over the uninter-
rupted space of the lakes. Illustrating this force, the writer has ob-
served on Grand Island, Lake Superior, sand and large gravel stones car-
ried from the beach over a cliff 175 feet high, and the glass plates pro-
tecting the lenticular apparatus of the Grand Island Light, which is 205
feet above lake level, are chipped and scratched by this wind driven
gravel. Dunes are formed by dry beach sand carried inland by the wind.
Frost action in disintegrating rock is well known. Interesting evi-
dence of this action is observed on Isle Royale, Lake Superior, the only
place in the world where the chlorastrolite or "green stone" appears.
These curious stones occur in the igneous black trap rock of Isle Royale,
much as garnets occur in granite, and are much sought by tourists.
The illuminating fact is that these stones are comparatively plentiful
on certain beaches in the spring, but can rarely be found after the tourist
season in the fall. A curious effect of frost is apparent in league with
seas and grinding ice on Michigan Island, Apostle Group, Lake Supe-
rior. The shores of this island are precipitous bluffs of hard pan from
35 to 65 feet high, and on the exposed east banks erosion is proceeding
rapidly. Frost hardens these bluffs to the consistency of soft sand rock,
which wear away at the base under the atcion of grinding ice to almost
perpendicular cliffs. When frost leaves in the spring these "cliffs" slide
into the lake, carrying the banks and vegetation above. Aided by rain
and surface water, these slides continue through the summer until the
angle of repose is reached. Figure I is from a photograph taken on this
shore in midsummer. The erosive action of rain is quite apparent.
B. Waves.
The wave is the principal agent of erosion and its action is impor-
tant in considering methods for protection.
The surface of the free wave, unaffected by outside influence, e. g.,
a dead sea in deep water, has the form of the familiar sine curve. There


THIS MICHIGAN TECHNIC
is no forward movement of water, but each particle has a movement of
circular oscillation forward on the crest and backward in the trough
of equal velocity and duration. This oscillation is greatest at the sur-
face, and decreases in amplitude in geometrical progression as the depth
of water increases in arithmetical progression until motion ceases. The
longer the wave length the deeper this oscillation extends. Short high
waves are comparatively shallow.
MICHIGAN ISLAND, LAKE SUPERIOR
A wave driven by the wind loses its regular surface form, the oscil-
lation of particles are not complete and a forward movement of water
results, which in the case of a continued blow forms currents in the direc-
tion of the wind, known as wind currents.
W hen the wave reaches shoal water, its length and velocity decrease
and its height increases; the resultant oscillation become elliptical, tilted
upward and natter toward the bottom with increasing amplitude, reach-
ing a mere linear oscillation on the bottom and parallel thereto. Figure
•"&gt; illustrates these formations.
The trough of the wave always precedes the crest, i. e., the lower
return sweep comes before the upper forward movement. Note the out-


33
rush of water preceding the first crest of the wake when a ship passes
near shore, sometimes uncovering the shore two or three feet. The
wave rushing toward shore, breaks when the water becomes so shallow
that there is not sufficient water to supply this backward upsweep of
the face of the wave. The distance from shore that a wave breaks,
therefore varies directly as the size and depth of the wave.
When a wave breaks, the mass of water constituting the back or
crest of the wave, plunges forward and, impelled by the velocity of the
wave, rushes up the beach until the force of gravity offsets the velocity
by the law of V2 — 2gh, and the mass of water comes to rest; then re-
turns down the sloping shore with increasing velocity in accordance with
the same law. Wind driven waves follow so closely as a rule that the
return rush of a proceeding wave meets the plunges of that following,
often breaking it up with the resulting deposit of material carried by it.
Usually, however, the plunge rises over the back rush, or undertow,
with no appreciable interruption to either.
The erosive action is as follows:—The plunge of the wave strikes the
bottom violently, stirring up the sand and silt into suspension and driv-
ing gravel and stones before it along the bottom. At the point of zero
velocity all heavy materials are deposited, but as the undertow gains ve-
locity the finer material held in suspension is swept seaward, the mate-
rials being deposited in order of their size and weight as gravity over-
comes the viscosity of the water. Silt being held in suspension indefi-
nitely, eventually finds its way into deep water and is deposited at un-
disturbed depths. The transport of material is greater as the shore is
approached, because of the greater amplitude of oscillation.
While the forward and backward swings of oscillation are probably
equal seaward of the plunge, yet the backward swing down the slope has
the advantage of the aid of gravity, producing a gradual seaward move-
ment of the material on the bottom, which does not cease until the depth
of no wave disturbance is reached. The gradient of the foreshore is
determined by gravity, tending to approach an angle of repose such that
the force of the undertow aided by gravity shall equal the force of the
upward plunge aided by the wave velocity. This produces long grad-
ual slopes on sand beaches and short, steep slopes on gravel or boulder
shores.
The fact that on all large bodies of water there exists a submerged
plateau whose edge or bank skirts the shore at a varying distance and
at a depth of water corresponding to the maximum depth of wave distur-
bance, is a striking illustration of this erosive action, the conclusion being
that where oscillation ceases no further translation of material occurs.
All waves, irrespective of direction other than offshore, tend to
break parallel to the shore line, due in the case of oblique waves, to the
retarding action of shoal water at the inner end of the wave. The angle
of incidence, therefore, depends on the gradient of the shore.


35
Only oblique waves, i. e., waves striking the shore at an angle, cause
translation or alongshore movement of materials. This occurs in the
manner indicated in the sketch, Figure 4, where the translation is gov-
erned by the retarding action of gravity upshore and friction alongshore
This movement is often very great, particularly on boulder or gravel
shores where the gradient is usually steep.
The power in the impact of waves is enormous. Various measure-
ments of this force are on record, the usual maximum being about 3,000
lbs. per sq. ft, though some measurements are recorded as high as 7,000
lbs. per sq. ft. The greatest impact is produced midway between trough
and crest. The writer has seen mass concrete blocks forming the toe of
a breakwater, measuring each 8 ft. long, 6 ft. wide and 4 ft. thick, turned
completely over by seas. Sixty twenty-five foot sections of the Harbor
Beach breakwater, Lake Huron, constructed of mass concrete on stone
filled cribs, were broken up and some of them destroyed by wave impact
in the storm of November 9, 1913. Wave pressure on porous rock and
TRANSLATION
crevices filled with water, exerts bursting effect becoming explosive
when the crevices are filled with air. Rock fragments broken from cliffs
in this manner and by frost are hurled about by the waves and produce
rapid erosion of cliffs, as well as attrition of foreshore materials. Figure
5 is from a photograph taken at Devils Island, Apostle Group, Lake
Superior, illustrating the action of waves on hard sand rock without
the aid of rock fragments or foreshore material of any kind; and Figure
2, from a photograph at Split Rock, Minn., Lake Superior, illustrates
the combined action of frost and attrition.
C. Currents.
As waves are chiefly responsible for erosion, so are currents the
principal agents of translation of materials.
Currents are of various kinds, according to origin. There has been
given above the cause of wind currents, generally the most important on
the Great Lakes as regard movement of shore materials. In fact sand
movement is due almost entirely to the combined action of oblique waves


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
and wind currents, except in certain limited localities where natural
stream currents predominate. Wave translation alone is not great, as
is apparent when a shift of wind drives waves in a direction opposed to
the wind current then flowing, it being observed that the drift is with
file current.
As a rule these currents parallel the shore line; however, with a di-
rect onshore wind blowing, a surface current is set up and a piling up
of the water follows, which results jn a compensating offshore current
or undertow with consequent erosion and rapid seaward travel of mate-
rials stirred up by the waves. Conversly an offshore wind often pro-
duces an onshore undercurrent with resulting accretion, although this
is rarely as strong as the erosive action.
DEVILS ISLAND. LAKE SUPERIOR
Natural Stream currents on the Great Lakes, produced by the flow
of the lakes toward the sea, are very strong in certain localities and
are important to navigation because of the narrowing of the channels.
They affect very materially the shores in these places, especially in
conjunction with prevailing winds.
Other currents are induced by variation in barometric pressure-
A rise of one inch in the barometer will produce a water depression
of from six to twelve inches. The writen has witnessed a rise in water
level on the south shore of Lake Superior of thirty inches in six hours.
This is unusual, although variations in level of one foot are common
and they seem to occur at very irregular intervals, due no doubt, to
variations in the barometer and not to tidal action. This is borne out
by the custom of lake mariners to regard such changes as indications
of a blow in the direction of high water.


37
On the sea coasts tidal currents are the most important forces for
movement of shore materials in conjunction with wave action very-
similar to the action of wind currents on the lakes.
On the transporting power of currents lies their importance and
this seems to follow well defined principles.
These may be briefly stated as follows:
The surface velocity of a current is about 1.5 times the bottom
velocity. Sediment in suspension reduces the velocity of a current
The diameters of suspended particles vary directly as the square of the
velocity of the current and their weights vary directly as the sixth
power of its velocity.
Presence of suspended materials in a current increases its density.
The pressure exerted by a current tending to move particles varies
directly as the density of the fluid. The velocity of a current neces-
sary to move materials at rest varies inversely as the square root of the
fluid density. The current velocity necessary to move materials, e. g.
gravel, in mass is four times that required to move single pieces.
An undisturbed, perfect current has the properties of still water,
so far as suspension or transport of material is concerned. Such cur-
rents do not occur along shores, but the fact emphasizes the importance,
such as produced by eddies in the suspension and translation of mate-
rials, and the equal importance of breaking up such disturbance to pro-
duce accumulation.
It has been found that currents from one to three feet per second
cause movement of particles on the bottom in the form of short sand
wave ripples of very low velocity. Higher current velocity produces
stream motion of material along the bottom and still higher velocity
of current produces surface waves which apparently cause the formation
of long sand waves on the bottom, varying from three to twenty feet
in length. This wave length increase with the increase in depth and
velocity of the current. These high velocities produce movement of
stones on the bottom, but the amount of stone and coarse gravel
moved by alongshore currents is negligible because of low current
velocity.
Suspension is necessary for appreciable movement of materials by
currents and this depends upon the viscosity of the water, upward thrust
of eddies and upon the fact that suspended particles follow lines of
least resistance and, therefore, move upward into currents of higher
velocity. Also a greater quantity of fine material than coarse of the
same density is carried in suspension, because the surface areas of the
smaller particles are greater in proportion to their weights.
Rate of settlement is also important in the deposition of shore mate-
rials. In currents, time of settlement varies as the square root of
the diameters of the larger particles, and as the square of the diameters
of the smaller. Settlement of fine silt is affected by the temperature,
occurring twice as fast in summer as in winter.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
CONCLUSIONS
Summing up, the movement of gravel and boulders is produced
by waves alone, and translation of this material is caused by oblique
wave action, all movement taking place by rolling along the bottom.
Sand and silt, driven into suspension by wave action, are chiefly trans-
ported by alongshore currents and deposited in accordance with the
size of the particles or carried seaward by undertow wave action and
deposited according to the same principle. Sand, due to its inertia,
is easily thrown out of twisting currents and eddies and deposited,
while silt remains in suspension, following the slightest current and
is eventually carried into deep water before settlement occurs, beyond
the influence of currents. The size of particles of bottom materials
decreases as the depth of water increases.
It has been determined by various experiments and observations
that the quantity of alongshore drift decreases as the distance from
shote increases, which is a fact of importance to be considered in pro-
tection work.
GROINS
Purpose.
Groins have been briefly defined in a preceding paragraph. It
will now be apparent that the purpose of groin construction is to inter-
cept the movement of shore materials and in that way check the erosion
of the shore; and, where conditions are favorable, to cause an exten-
sion of the shore line by causing deposition of drift, thus forming an
efficient protection against encroachment of the seas and, what is more
important, a protection that constantly increases in efficiency.
It) is not always possible to cause accretion, but if properly applied
it is always possible to check erosion by taking advantage of the simple
material principles above outlined.
Direction.
There has been much difference of opinion regarding the proper
direction for groins, some advocating groins in the direction of pre-
vailing winds, others oblique groins extending away from prevailing
winds, and still others favoring a construction normal to the shore line.
The latter has become general practice, principally because - oblique
groins tend to set up seaward or onshore currents that become detri-
mental and even a serious menace to the accomplishment of the original
purpose, by reason of scour and seaward movement of materials.
These discussions refer to foreign practice, where groins are used
much more extensively than in this country. In fact, groining on the
Great Lakes is very limited, there being but three such constructions
within the knowledge of the writer.
Length.
Length is another indefinite matter. On the sea coast it is cus-
tomary now to build groins extending from above H. W. M. to a
short distance beyond L. W. M., except on gravel and boulder coasts,


39
where much shorter groins are sufficient because of the behavior and
translation of gravel in accordance with the principles above outlined.
Two things may be considered to determine the length of lake
groins, whether the drift is composed of gravel and boulders only, and
the probable distance from shore that drift occurs in any quantity,
roughly determinate by the gradient of the foreshore. The groin should
extend somewhat beyond the limit of drift, because of the tendency to
scour around the end of the groin, and in all cases should extend inshore
well into the bank above H. W. M. to prevent seas cutting behind it.
Spacing.
This is a matter that must be determined from experience and for
each locality separately, depending upon conditions. Too great a
distance between groins may cause erosion, and if too close together
a continuous agitation of the water will prevent accumulation. Roughly,
lake groins should be spaced a distance equal to the length of groin sea-
ward of the water line.
Height.
This is another much debated question in foreign practice, but best
results seem to have been obtained with low groins, i. e., those not
over three feet above the shore level, which permit of material passing
over the top during high tides, thus equalizing deposition either side
of the groin. Experience with high groins has been that great quanti-
ties of material collect on the windward side and erosion takes place
to leeward, all of which is unsightly, dangerous to pedestrians, and
jeopardizes the groin itself, if not even a protected sea-wall, by under-
mining. On the tideless waters of the Great Lakes other considera-
tions enter into the question and the height will vary depending on
the method of construction, exposure, etc This will be mentioned
again below.
Types.
The use of groins dates from the seventeenth century, but only
in recent years has the practice been very extensive. Types of con-
struction are almost as numerous as the groins themselves.
In England they are constructed of masonry, sometimes as mas-
sive as sea-walls, of mass concrete, of wood piles with intermediate
sheet piling, sometimes covered with galvanized iron, of continuous
wood piling, and of reinforced concrete posts with intermediate rein-
forced concrete curtain walls built up in sections. The latter type,
called the Case groin, is now usually constructed. It is a low groin
and the movable curtain wall sections permit of extending the height
as accumulation increases.
In Holland groins are almost always constructed of wood and
straw facines covered with earth and capped with gravel and stone.
At Blankenberghe are wide, flat groins with curved top and sloping
sides about thirty feet wide, constructed of facines and concrete, capped
with brick and stone.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
At Mecklenburg are groins of two rows of piles between which
are packed facines secured by cross timbers. Here a beach has formed
6^2 feet deep and 164 feet wide in nine years.
In Italy groins are built,, at enormous expense, of masonry and
rock more on the manner of breakwater and jetty construction in this
country.
Lake Groins.
The first groins on the Greak Lakes, to his knowledge, were located
by the writer in 1908 at Whitefish Point, Lake Superior, and were
constructed during the three following seasons. These are of rough log
cribs,drift pinned and filled with one man stone, varying in length from
twenty feet to one hundred feet, eight feet wide and averaging three
GROINS 5 AND 6
feet above water level. Erosion, which was very rapid before their
construction, has been stopped. Accretion of sand is variable, usually
extending the length of the groins on the prevailing windward sides,
sometimes covering them completely, and at other times after a severe
storm from the opposite quarter the groins are left clear of sand as
originally constructed. There is no gravel on this side of the point.
In 1911, similar groins were constructed at Sand Point, Lake Supe-
rior, with the result that the cribs became buried in sand, extending
the shore line to the ends of the groins.
Last year the case mentioned in the opening paragraphs arose and
it fell to the writer to devise and construct protection. The conditions
there were unusual in that a natural current of about four miles per
hour set past this shore, which had a steep gradient and was exposed
to the full sweep of Lake Huron and oblique wave action in the direc-
tion of the current.


4&gt;
A system of groining was laid out as shown in Figure 7, but it
was decided to construct only groins 3, 5, and 6 at that time, as an
immediate protection to the sea wall, and to watch the action of these
groins before proceeding with further construction.
Groins were first designed using Lackawanna Interlocking Steel
Sheet Pilling painted with an inhibitive paint and driven to a
depth sufficient to resist maximum ice pressure, being 10 feet with the
fulcrum 2 feet below the surface of the sand. This construction was
abandoned because of the comparatively high cost in consideration of
the experimental nature of the project. There is, too, some doubt as to
the efficiency of a tight groin here, owing to the danger of setting
up serious scour by deflecting this high current around the ends of
the groins.
The groins then devised and later constructed were for the rea-
son last stated above, made of continuous wood piling, piles 10 inches
to 16 inches in diameter, driven as close together as they could be
handled, leaving the spaces between for the passage of the current.
They were driven deep enough to resist ice pressure, and extended 6
feet above water to act as wave breakers. A cap timber was put on
to hold the alignment until permanent double wales could be bolted up.
Results were immediate. Before the completion of the groins
the shore built out as shown in Figure 7, being 25 feet at groin No. 6.
Two days after the completion of the last groin a terrific storm swept
the lakes with an unusual rise of water at this point and had it not
been for the groins so recently completed, which acted as wave breakers,
the sea-wall and several valuable structures fronting it would have
been annihilated. As it happened, the seas broke around the shore
end of No. 6 and washed out quantities of sand. Groin No. 6 was
later extended 65 feet inshore. During this one storm the beach made
out in front of the sea-wall 35 feet as indicated in Figure 7. Figure 6
is from a photograph taken after the storm showing groin No. 5 at the
end of the breakwater and groin No. 6 beyond. The former beach line
followed the dark drift line shown nearly in line with the old pile
fence.


SCOPE WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE
TO STABILIZING PROBLEMS
JOHN AIREY, D.I.C.
The name gyroscope was given by Foticault, a French physicist, to that
which most of us recognize by that name and are familiar with chiefly in
the form of a toy.
A gyroscope or gyrostat in its broader engineering sense is a rapidly-
rotating heavy wheel, whose axis of rotation is itself changing in direction.
There appears to be no definite distinction in the use of the terms gyroscope
and gyrostat; the most rational would appear in calling an action gyroscopic
when precession is quite free or controllable at will; and gyrostatic when the
axis of rotation is fixed relatively to some large structure. According to
this distinction gyrostatic action is usually incidental and not desired—is
tolerated because it cannot be got rid of, as may be seen in an auto, train,
motorcycle or aeroplane making a curve; gyroscopic action on the contrary
is the most salient feature of the mechanism; as in monorail mechanism.
Schlick's steadying apparatus, the gyro-compass.
For a long time back gyroscopic phenomena have interested both the
initiated and the laity. The powers and knowledge of the former have been
frequently taxed to the utmost in the attempt to explain fully some mani-
festations; the latter have been fascinated by something which appears to be
immune from the elementary laws of mechanics.
Until comparatively recently this subject was at home almost exclusively
in the domain of mathematics. However, engineers have had the subject
brought to the fore in the last decade, first by things which have been
accomplished mainly by the use of gyroscopes and which would otherwise
be more difficult of solution—monorails, and so forth; second, where
gyrostatic effects come in incidentally and cause unlooked for stresses and
therefore have to be allowed for in design. In innumerable cases gyrostatic
action comes in to a greater or less extent. It is worth remembering that as
speeds increase so does the importance of gyrostatic action; hence it follows
that cases which, a few decades ago, could be ignored from this point of view,
can now no longer be ignored, clue to the all-round increases of speeds. In
many cases gyrostatic action exists in principle, though of such small magni-
tude as to be negligible, although this negligibility must be proved and not
assumed.
The subject having developed almost exclusively in a mathematical
atmosphere, it is not surprising that it brings with it a heritage of complexity
into engineering. This is a pity. Most engineers believe that there is some-

45
thing intrinsically difficult in getting a clear idea of the fundamental principle
involved and that it would take more time to master it than they care to give.
This state of affairs is not to be wondered at, as the viewpoint of the pure
mathematician and the engineering mathematician are essentially different.
The former insists on a rigorous solution embodying all conditions no matter
how complex. The latter is ready to approximate, if by so doing, he can
cut down complexity and so more easily retain his physical grasp of the
problem. The mathematician builds up the most general case and deduces
easy cases from this as particular examples; the engineer begins with the
simplest case and gradually builds up the more difficult ones. It is true that
if one wishes to pursue all the ramifications of gyroscopic phenomena to the
limit quantitatively, then the most advanced mathematical machinery may be
used to advantage. The important thing to the engineer is, however, first
to understand the phenomena qualitatively, and second, to be able to handle
the simplest case (with constant precessional velocity) quantitatively. The
further than this that one goes, the better, but this is amply sufficient (and
needs no more than very elementary mechanics) to prevent engineers being
scared off gyroscopic phenomena as something intensely mathematical.
The gyroscope has already done remarkable things and the future will
probably see other equally or more remarkable applications in practice. There
is no reason why a man of no mathematical knowledge but of inventive
genius could not advantageously study the gyroscope. The magnitude of
the action can be sensed sufficiently for a preliminary trial; and with all the
mathematics possible recourse must always be had finally to experiment.
I do not underrate the advantage of mathematical ability in studying the
gyroscope, but wish to make it clear that lack of that knowledge does not
deter a man from applying it to new problems.
In 1874 a great amount of money was spent in trying to keep the saloon
of a ship steady in spite of a heavy roll of the boat. The attempt was made
by Sir Henry Bessemer, of steel fame, a gyrostat being employed. Accord-
ing to the distinction given between gyroscope and gyrostat, the fiasco can
be tersely explained by saying that they employed a gyrostat whereas they
should have employed a gyroscope. If the men in charge of that venture had
understood gyroscopic action simply from a qualitative point of view that
blunder and consequent waste of money would never have occurred.
Probably most readers are already vaguely acquainted with gyroscopic
action. If not, then take a portable electric fan, hold it in the hands when
running with the axis horizontal and then give a sharp twist about a vertical
axis; or take a toy gyroscope, spin it and put it in its box with the lid on;
now twist the box spasmodically in any direction. There will be a decided
kick felt—rather suggestive of the thing being alive. The reason why the
gyroscope is sometimes facetiously attributed with occult powers is because
if you try to twist it about a given line, it will not move at all, or very little,
about that line, but will move about some other axis, probably at right angles
with the first axis. All this erratic behavior can be boiled down to one simple
rule.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Discussion of Principle.
The most convenient way to take up the study of the gyroscope is to
get a small model, as shown in Fig. r. This can he obtained for 25c.
If the model be placed as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, one end on the tripod
and with its axis horizontal, then if not spinning it will immediately fall
down, but if spinning fairly fast it will scarcely fall at all, but revolve bodily
around a vertical axis through A.
In any gyroscope there are three important axes, thtspin axis, the preces-
sion axis and the torque axis.
In examining any gyroscopic mechanism, these axes should be the first
things to look for; if two are located, the third can always be found by a
simple rule. In the simplest case these axes are mutually perpendicular.
Let us determine each of these axes in the present case. The easiest to note
is the spin axis, as this is the axle of the wheel AB. It will be noticed that
the whole framework swings bodily as if it were attached to a vertical
spindle through the center of the tripod. The line AC is in consequence


45
called the precession axis. The center of gravity of the wheel and frame is
at D, and the weight acting through here may be represented by an arrow IV.
The force W is exerting a moment W X AD about a line AO (see Fig. i,
which is a plan of Fig. 2). Because the tendency of the unsupported weight
is to cause rotation about AO, this line is called the torque axis. If the
wheel is rotating clockwise when viewed from B, then the point B will be
found to precess clockwise in Fig. 1, and counterclockwise, if the motion of
the wheel be reversed.
To reduce this to a simple rule, it is necessary to standardize the way
of representing torque and rotation. Rotation of the wheel about AB is
represented by an arrow from B to A; the arrowhead must point from B to
A. This is easily remembered by the fact that a corkscrew, if turned with
the wheel, will travel from B to A. If the wheel's rotation were reversed,
the arrowhead would also be reversed. For the same reason the torque axis
is AO, not OA. Now for the rule:
The spin axis, if free to move, always takes the shortest course whicH
will enable it to set itself parallel to the torque axis, the arrow heads to point
in the same direction.
If the spin axis is not free to move in this way, then it will tend to do so
and a sufficiently strong reaction will have to be provided to prevent it so
moving. It is evident that for BA to try to set itself along AO, the motion
must be clockwise in Fig. 1.
Let the spin be N r.p.m. about AB, and the precession be n r.p.m. about
AC, then it will be shown that:
W X AD — 0.01096 InN
W is the weight of the wheel and frame in lb.;
/ is the moment of inertia of the wheel in engineers units of mass X ft2.
Proof op Fundamental Formula When Precessional
Velocity Is Constant.
In any standard textbook on theoretical mechanics it is proved that
Torque = Rate of Change of Moment of Momentum; also that Torque and
Moment of Momentum are vector quantities.
In Figs. 3 and 4 two views of a disk are shown which is rotating about
OZ as axis and is making &lt;a radians per sec. OZ is shown in Fig. 3 and is
normal to plane of paper in Fig. 4. A torque of T lb.-ft. about OX is caused
to act on it. The Moment of Momentum may be represented by a vector OZ
whose length is Iw (= Mo. of Momtm.) to some convenient scale.
Torque = Rate of Change of Mo. of Mom. is written T = I dw/dt or
T 8 t = I 8 w where S tand 8&lt;u are small increments of time and angular
velocity respectively.
In time 8 t a torque T about OX will cause an increase of Mo. of
Mom. = T 81 along OX. This is laid off to scale as shown. Now the
resultant will be the vector sum of these two, or R in Fig. 3. For this to be
true it is evident that the framework must have so turned that the axis is in


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the line R; that is, the gyro has precessed through an angle 8 0. Imagine this"
disk to be the wheel of Figs, i and 2. Its precessional velocity is therefore
8 0/8 t = Q (say) rads. per sec.
Also 8 0 = T 8 t/I o. therefore
81
or
;t = n = T/l«
T -■= I &lt;»ri = 0.01096 /nAr.
This equation is proved on the supposition that the precessional velocity is
constant. No further complication than this is needed for the purpose of
grasping the fundamental principle of gyroscopic action. Another assump-
tion made is that N is a great many times larger than n. This is abundantly
true in all practical applications. The pure mathematician usually does not
make use of this assumption and so adds greatly to the difficulty of the
solution without reaping any advantage therefrom.
What the Equation Means.
A careful study of this equation will now be taken up, helped by experi-
mental check, the better to sense the facts. In this equation can be seen why
the Bessemer Saloon was a failure, why the monorail car does not fall over,
how ships can be steadied and why a gyro-compass is possible.


47
Let us put this equation in words:
Torque = Spin X Precession X a Constant.
If, therefore, the spin be reduced, the precession will increase and vice versa,
that is assuming the torque to remain constant. Check by experiment. If
the spin keep constant then precession increases with the torque. Try this
by hanging a small weight at B. Now artificially increase the precession by
holding a pencil vertically and following up B slightly, helping it onward.
If precession increases then the above equation states that torque increases
also; but the torque to be counteracted is the same as before, W at a lever-
age AD. The gyroscopic torque is now (due to artificially increased preces-
sion) more than sufficient to hold W at a leverage AD from falling, and
actually lifts it. The point D will be found to move upward as well as on-
ward. This is the essence of the monorail car.
Next slightly impede the precessional motion by holding a pencil in
front of B and pressing gently backward. The equation states that if the
precession be decreased, then the torque is also decreased; but there is still
IV X to be counteracted. What happens? The gyroscopic torque is
decreased and must, therefore, be insufficient to hold up the wheel, the result
is that the center of gravity slowly falls. It falls slowly because the support-
ing moment is only slightly and not completely annulled. The fact that the
precession has some value other than zero partially counteracts the fall.
Carry this to the extreme and hold the pencil so that the precession is stopped
dead. Result! The wheel falls exactly as if it were not spinning. This is of
vast importance. If precession is not permitted then there is no counter-
acting torque. Lack of appreciation of this fact was the sole cause why, in
1874, the expensive attempt to make a ship's saloon remain steady in a rough
sea was a failure and remained unsolved until the beginning of the next
century, when Herr Otto Schlick successfully attacked the problem.
It is often said and is widely believed that a spinning wheel tries to
keep its axis of rotation always the same. Implicit belief in this has been the
cause of many erroneous ideas. This statement is not true except under
certain conditions. To come back to Fig. 1. The resultant force IV tends
to make the gyroscope turn about AO, but does not succeed in doing so, so
long as it is free to prccess about AC. If not (when the pencil was held in
front), then it turns about AO. just exactly as if the wheel were not spin-
ning. So that in either case the axis of spin changes and will change no
matter how small W may be. The real anomaly lies in the fact that, if free
to precess. it does not move in the way one would expect, but it does move
nevertheless. v
Practical Applications.
Gyroscopes have been applied (and practically all in the last decade)
with the following results:
(a) The roll of a ship has been reduced, and can be reduced to any
extent desired, even to zero.


THE MICHIGAN TECHSIC
(b) A ship has been made to roll even though waves are absent. This
has been used to enable a ship to shake itself free from ice when opening a
track for itself. This can be clone much more efficiently if the ship goes
forward with a regular roll, as this prevents a wedging action in the ice.
(c) A ship has been made to pitch for the purpose of ice-breaking.
(d) A torpedo has been made to keep a constant direction independent
of the waves tending to skew it.
(e) Platforms for quick-firing guns have been kept level in spite of
the roll of the ship.
(f) A one-rail train has been made a practical venture; though it
remains to be seen whether it is a commercial venture on any large scale.
(g) An aeroplane has been made automatically to keep a level deck.
(h) Last, but probably most important of all, a compass has been
made which will determine the true geographical North and so enable
navigators to be independent of the variable and troublesome magnetic
North; also in the future, it will probably enable one to be independent of
fine days or starry nights in accurate survey work.
Application to Ships
In the following discussion the case of the application of the passive
type to the steadying of ships will be taken up in detail, and a partial
mathematical treatment undertaken.
The first attempt to steady a ship was made by Sir Henry Bessemer
in 1874 when the Bessemer Steamship Company was formed for the pur-
pose of constructing a steamer with a saloon swung on trunnions, and moved
relatively to the ship by hydraulic means in such a way as always to keep a
level floor no matter how the ship rolled. The hydraulic cylinders were to
be controlled by means of a gyroscope but the mistake was made of prevent-
ing precession; thus the gyro did not respond to the rolling of the ship and
act as a controller. That this would be so was pointed out by Mr. Mac-
farlane Gray who also pointed out the remedy—viz., let the precession go
free. An agreement could not be reached between the Bessemer Company
and Mr. Gray for the use of this improvement, so the problem remained un-
solved for 32 years, when Dr. Otto Schlick revived it and made a bold step
forward in determining to use a gyro not merely as a sensitive element but
to use the gyro directly to steady the boat.
Fig. 5 is a photograph of a model of this application made by the writer
for demonstration purposes. The wooden cradle swinging on bearings as
shown, represents the rolling of the ship. This rolling is caused by holding
the pendulum weight out from the vertical and then releasing, the weight
thus swinging back and forth in a plane athwartship. By altering the length
of the string, waves of different period may be represented. The gyro
framework, e. g., wheel, motor, and precessional azle. swings about an
athwartship axis—the C. G. of swinging mass being well below the axis of
suspension. Underneath there is a small catch which locks the gyro and so
prevents the precession. It is sufficient to convince the most skeptical of the


49
magnitude of gyroscopic action, to get hold of the top of the iron framework
and try to rock the cradle—first with the catch in place; second with unre-
stricted precession. In the first place the cradle rocks quite easily as if no
gyroscopic action were there; in the second case it is scarcely possible to
move it at all. Means are provided whereby the stabilities of the cradle and
gyro can be varied at will, and either or both may be made stable, neutral
or unstable. The behaviour in each case is very different; this behaviour
can be explained mathematically.
In 1906, Schlick showed that it was both practical and commercial to
steady a ship by means of a gyroscope. He fitted up the See-bar, a former
German torpedo boat, with a gyroscope as shown in model. The wheel was
about 3' 3" in diameter, weighed 1100 lbs. and made 1600 R. P. M. The
drive was by steam, the wheel itself forming a turbine wheel, and steam being
led in through the hollow precession trunnions. In a rough sea a roll of 150
on each side of the vertical with precession locked became a total of only
1.50 with precession free to occur. Means are provided for braking the
precession hydraulically, this being necessary as referred to later. In sub-
sequent equipments both the drive and the braking are done electrically.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Messrs. Swan, Hunter and VVigham Richardson have the patent rights for
all European countries except Germany and the first boat they fitted was the
"Lochiel," a Scottish pleasure boat. In Germany the first to be fitted with
this equipment was the "Silvana," of the Hamburg Amerika Line, plying
between Hamburg and German watering places.
Another use to which the gyroscope can be put on board ship—the
converse of the above, is to force the precession alternately back and forth,
even when there is no rolling tendency acting on the ship. The result is to
make the ship roll and thus open a course for itself in pack ice. A vessel
has been equipped in this way on the Great Lakes and another in Russia,
with the difference that the Russian one had forced pitching instead of
rolling.
Mr. Elmer A. Sperry, the inventor of the Sperry gyro-Compass, and
the man most to the front in this country in gyroscopic work, has improved
on Schlick's method by controlling the precession all the time by a precession
engine. The direction in which the precession is forced is determined by a
small sensitive gyroscope that answers to very small motions of the boat.
The roll is thus anticipated as compared to the more lethargic Schlick system,
and the boat can be held in a much more nearly vertical position with a given
size of gyroscope. This is known as the Active type of gyroscope and has
greater possibilities than the other or Passive type, although evidently more
complicated. The passive type will, however, always have a big field due to
its greater simplicity.
It is easier to theorise about the active type of gyro because the preces-
sion, instead of being the result of the combination of many influences, is
directly determined by a separate engine or motor. In analyzing the action
of the free precession or passive type it is a little difficult to see why the
precession should be braked to get the best results: in fact it appears at first
sight that the ship should be held perfectly still if the precession be quite free.
In the preceding proof of T = IcoU it must be remembered that Q was
considered constant. Imagine the boat in a vertical position and still, when
suddenly a torque T is caused to act by the waves. Now if O could im-
mediately get up to a value sufficient to satisfy this equation then the torque
would be wholly occupied on the gyro and the ship would remain quite still.
However, due to the fact that the gyro has considerable inertia about the
precession axis, Q cannot immediately get up to the requisite value so the
ship partly rolls under the influence of T though by no means as much as it
would if the gyro were absent.
It is evident that the effect of the gyro is to make the ship more
reluctant to move: in fact it will be shown later that the net effect, if preces-
sion be free, is to increase the inertia of the ship and so to increase the
natural period, that is if the gyro framework has itself more than a certain
critical amount of stability.
Clearly the gyro does not take any energy of roll from the boat if pre-
cession is free. It benefits the boat merely by making the possibility of
synchronous wave action less likely. The gyro has no damping action on the
boat. If, however, the precession be braked, then work is actually done


51
against this brake and hence reduces the rolling energy of the ship, thus
producing a damping effect.
The following mathematical discussion, though deduced to fit the
present case, is really further reaching in its results, and could with prac-
tically no alteration be applied to any application where there is one body
able to vibrate about a certain axis, and a gyro able to vibrate (or precess)
about an axis at rt. angles to the first axis.
Notation: I —- Moment of Inertia of whole apparatus about axis of
Ig = Moment of Inertia of gyroframework about axis of
precession.
m — Moment of Momentum of flywheel — moment of
inertia X angular velocity.
a = Weight of cradle and gyro X distance of common C.G.
below axis of roll.
b —Weight of gyro of framework X distance of C.G.
below axis of precession. Obviously if cradle is made
top-heavy, then a will become negatixe; similarly b will
be negative if gyro be weighted so as to be top-heavy.
R — angle of roll from vertical position.
P = angle of precession from vertical position.
We can now write out an equation of motion for the roll of the ship and
another for the precession of the spin axis. Take direction of R and P such
that, as R increases, P tends also to increase.
The speed of rolling is dR/dt; there is therefore a gyroscopic torque
tending to increase P, of magnitude m dR/dt; also from the rule previously
given, there must be a torque m dP/dt tending to decrease R.
Considering these we get:—
Differentiating and substituting so as to separate P &amp; R, also writing
8 for d/dt we are led to—

These are linear differential equations with constant coefficients, the type
of differential equations most frequently met with in the application of
mathematics to engineering problems.


THE MICHIGAN TECHSIC
The solution is of the form:—
(6)
where 0„ 02, #3, 6t are roots of the equation,
f+ (a// + i-//gm7//K)#2+ ab/IIg = o.
(7)
If the roots should come all imaginary then R is a periodic function of
time and becomes
If part of the roots are real and part are imaginary then the solution is
a combination of these two.
Obviously there is an enormously wide difference between a solution of
type (6) or of type (8). In the former R may increase indefinitely with
time, i. e., the apparatus might fall right over. With the latter solution there
is a vibration about a mean position which is, of course, a satisfactory state
of affairs. With a combination of (6) and (8) there is a progressive falling
away superposed on an oscillatory motion.
It has been mentioned that the behaviour of this apparatus is greatly
modified as a and b are changed.
Equation (7) will now be studied and the effect on the integral equation
(6) and (8) noted, as constants a and b are varied.
Before proceeding further it is as well to look into the limitations of
this discussion. In practice the precessional motion is braked for reasons
already mentioned; also there is a resistance to the rolling of the ship. These
introduce an additional term in each of the equations (1) and (2), which in
turn bring in the odd derivatives of R and P in (4) and (5). These add
very greatly to the length and tediousness of a complete solution, though, if
numerical values be taken in the region of practical application, it will be
found that these terms do not alter the type of motion except to introduce
damping. Also by keeping this complication out it is much easier to exam-
ine the effect of variations in a and b.
Discussion of types of solution:—
Let a and b be both positive, then 6" in (7) has two negative values,
hence 6 has four imaginary values. The solution is therefore of type (8),
viz., vibration about a mean position: the influence of friction terms being
to successively decrease these swings.
Let a be negative. This is evidently the case of the monorail. Rewrit-
ing (7) as 0* -J- AO2 + C = 0 (9) we have now C negative and A may be
positive or negative. The values of 62 are opposite in sign: that is $ has two
real values and two imaginary. This means that a solution is a combination
of (6) and (8V Verification is easily obtained experimentally for, if cradle
be made top-heavy, it vibrates about a mean position that is continually
falling away from the vertical.
R = #1 sin «,/ + Bs cos 0,f + C, sin 8,t + C, cos »2&lt;
(8)


53
Precisely the same discussion holds if b be made negative. This also is
easily verified.
Now what happens if both a and b are negative? i. e., if both cradle and
gyroscope are top-heavy—the thing would appear now doubly unstable. In
preceding equations, C is again positive and A may be of either sign. There
are two cases therefore: (a) if A is positive i. e., if m2/II0 is &gt; a certain
critical value, viz., a/I -f b/I0 and (/?) if A is negative, i. e., if m-'/IIG is &lt;
this critical value. In case (a) the two values of 01 are negative, i. e., 0 has
all imaginary values: in case (/?) 6- has two positive or all values of 8 are
real. The conclusion is then that if l&gt;oth cradle and gyro are unstable the
whole is stable if speed of wheel be above a certain amount. If not above
this certain amount then both will fall away from the vertical.
This can be checked experimentally although the apparatus will not stay
up indefinitely. The friction terms that have been ignored cause the oscil-
lation to become gradually greater and greater. If both cradle and gyro be
held quite vertical before releasing, then several minutes elapse before the
affair falls right over: but if they be released already in an inclined position,
then oscillations are at the start considerable and quickly produce overturn-
ing. As this friction cannot possibly be wholly got rid of, it is seen that this
type of gyroscopic apparatus could not possibly succeed in keeping the
monorail-car in balance. In both the Brennan and Schilowsky mono-rail
systems this frictional effect is got rid of by a mechanism for artificially
affecting the precession. There is, however, a still more important reason
for hurrying the precession in a mono-rail mechanism. It is not sufficient
that the car remain just as it is in spite of wind or centrifugal force—it must
go over in the teeth of the opposition and lean on the wind or inwards in
turning a curve as a cyclist does, as in so doing lies its only permanent
stability.
To come back to the steadying of ships. The friction in both cases is
advantageous. The rolling resistance retards rolling and precessional fric-
tion absorbs energy which must come from the energy of rolling—thus
putting an additional brake on rolling.
If numerical values be substituted in (7) in the region of practical
cases, then the constant term will be found very small compared to the co-
efficient of 0s, thus indicating a small value and a big value for 02 which,
in turn, indicates a quick vibration and a slow vibration. If numerical values
are taken in a specific case the amplitude of the quick vibration is practically
negligible compared to that of the slow vibration. This can be observed
experimentally, for the quick vibration is not at all evident. The net effect
is to increase the natural period of roll.
Commercial Prospects of Gyroscopic Applications.
There are engineers today who still do not realize that the gyroscope has
ceased to be either a plaything or an ornament for a physics laboratory.
There is some excuse for this, as just over a decade ago this was the com-
mon belief. Times change however. First in order of commercial import-
ance come the gyro compass and the torpedo. The gyro compass is at present


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the accepted thing in all navies in spite of the excessive cost. New ships are
being fitted and old ones being changed as fast as can conveniently be done.
Several of the big liners have also adopted it.
The torpedo—that most destructive of weapons, when it hits—owes its
possibility to the gyroscope. Also its weakest point at present is admittedly
the directing power.
With the steadying of ships progress appears slower than was antici-
pated in spite of the fact that fear of seasickness deters thousands every
summer from making otherwise desirable trips.
The mono-rail has at present no commercial prospects, though those
engineers who dismiss it summarily as something ingenious but fanciful
show wonderfully little foresight. One hears the remark "It is all very
well going on one rail but who wants to when we can have two?" The
ultimate commercial supremacy of the mono-rail for fast traffic depends not
on the simpler permanent way (for this would probably be no cheaper) but
on the possibility of speed combined with safety. Railroads will never be
built without curves, and curves are dangerous because they can be made
right for one speed only: a speed smaller than this and the tendency is to
jump the rails toward the inside: higher than this and the tendency is to
jump toward the outside. A glance at the rails at the Ann Arbor curve will
convince anyone of the kind of thing that goes on in rounding a curve at a
big speed in spite of speed limit being 40 miles per hour.
A speed of 150 miles per hour is no faster to us than a speed of 70 miles
per hour appeared to our grandfathers. Or, to go a step forward and to
take the state of affairs in a "Modern Utopia" of H. G. Wells, we find a
speed of 200 miles per hour the normal thing for through trains between
large centers. These things appear far off, but let one look retrospectively
and then think of the present craze for time saving, and the possibilities in
electric drive on every wheel and an external form with least wind resistance
—then it does not appear so unlikely—if the unavoidable curves can be
safely negotiated. Herein lies the sole advantage of the mono-rail. Taking
a curve of 1000 ft. rad., then at 150 miles per hour, the track must be banked
at about 560 to horizontal—at 200 miles per hour this is increased to 700.
Obviously absurd to talk about with a two line track as it would be fatal at
any except that particular speed. The mono-rail car would automatically
take the precisely correct angle all the time, and the resultant of weight and
centrifugal force would go right through the line.
Jf the public tomorrow demanded a 150 mile an hour service between
New York and Chicago, and enterprising capital could be found, then the
mono-rail is the solution. Two decades hence will probably find one or more
such mono-rail lines in this country.


THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
H. E. KEELER, '12 E
It is the purpose of this article to
give a description of the experimen-
tal refrigeration plant located in the
mechanical laboratory of the Univer-
sity of Michigan, both from the
standpoint of the plant proper and
also the auxiliary special experimen-
tal equipment. After this descrip-
tion the work done along the lines
of investigation in the field of re-
frigeration will be taken up, as well
as a description of the other lines of
experimental work in which refrig-
eration in general plays an import-
ant part and, specifically, how this
plant is made use of along present
and will be made use of along fu-
ture lines of experimental testing
and research. The plant is designed
to operate on the dry compression
system which means that no liquid
ammonia, which is used as the re-
frigerant, is allowed to enter the
cyinder of the ammonia compressor.
In making the choice of a refrig-
erating equipment for the mechan-
ical laboratory many factors enter-
ed in which influenced the installa-
tion of the present plant. One of
the important factors was that the
present plant should be readily
adaptable to all kinds of investiga-
tion along the lines of the mechan-
ical production of cold. It was also
very desirable that the plant should
be representative of the most mod-
ern and standard commercial types.
The above statements applied with
equal force in the choice of the aux-
iliary apparatus, some of which is
special and much of which is stand-
ard apparatus, chosen and installed
with general flexibility of use kept
constantly in mind.
The prime mover consists of a 20
H. P. single cylinder Murray-Cor-
liss engine, built by the Murray Iron
Works Co., of Burlington, Iowa. It
has a cylinder bore of 9" and a
stroke of 18" and operates at a speed
of 90 R. P. M. The valve gear is of
the conventioual Corliss, single-ec-
centric type. The engine is fully
equipped with all of the necessary
accessories for running complete
engine tests of any character, being
provided with indicator connections,
reducing motion and other minor
but essential accessories. It is also
provided with a specially designed
compensating prony brake, by means
of which any desired load up to the
capacity of the engine may be stead-
ily and uniformly maintained during
an engine test. Steam is supplied
to the engine from the university
power station at a gauge pressure
of 125 pounds per square inch. The
exhaust piping from the engine is
so arranged that the engine may
exhaust into the atmosphere or into
a Wheeler surface-condensing equip-
ment which may be operated with
or without a vacuum. This con-
densing equipment furnishes an easy
and accurate means for determining
the water rates of the engine at dif-
ferent loads.
The ammonia compressor, which
is directly coupled to the shaft of the
engine, is a double-acting machine
of the DeKalb type, built by the


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Creamery Package Mfg. Co., of Chi-
cago, Illinois, and has a rating of
13 tons of refrigerating capacity.
The bore of the engine is 7" and the
stroke is 14"; the speed is, of course,
90 R. P. M. This compressor is
very representative of the larger
compressors in commercial service
and affords a refrigerating capacity
which is ample for any experiment-
al needs, present or future. The
compressor is of first-class construc-
tion thruout and is designed for
heavy continuous duty. All of its
parts are readily accessible. There
are two suction and two discharge
valves located in each end of the cy-
linder, and they are so arranged that
their faces are flush with the cylin-
der heads in order to reduce the
clearance to the lowest practicable
limit. One suction annd one dis-
charge valve in each end of the cyl-
inder are located at the lowest points
in order that any liquid ammonia,
which might by chance enter the cy-
linder, may not produce disastrous
results. The valves on the com-
pressor are of a special construction
which renders them easily replace-
able. The piston rod packing-gland
is very deep, and the packing is di-
vided into two sections by one lan-
tern or oil gland, which oil gland is
connected to the ammonia suction,
thus subjecting the outer section of
the packing to the suction pressure
only. This is usually comparatively
low and easily packed against, and
makes a tight joint possible without
causing undue friction. Uniform
pressure on the packing is insured
by means of a spiral spring which is
compressed by a nut having a fine
thread. Piston-rod and cylinder lu-
brication are effected by means of a
sight-feed lubricator feeding oil into
the oil gland at the rate of 3 or 4
drops per minute. It is a point
worthy of note in ammonia compres-
sor operation that only a high grade
of ammonia compressor oil should
be used, and that very sparingly.
The cylinder and cylinder heads are
very thoroughly water-jacketed for
the purpose of getting efficient com-
pression, keeping the cylinder valves
and piston-rod cool, and making lu-
brication satisfactory. The event of
cutting or scoring, it may be easily
replaced. The ammonia suction
manifold is provided with a strainer
for intercepting scale, thus prevent-
ing any liability of the compressor
cylinder becoming scored by foreign
matter entering it. The ammonia
compressor cylinder is provided with
two by-pass valves for the purpose
of pumping out the ammonia from
the high pressure portion of the sys-
tem or for equalizing the pressure
on the high and low pressure sides
of the system to facilitate starting.
Therometer wells are also provided
in which in insert thermometers for
determining the temperatures of the
ingoing and outgoing cooling water.
The compressor is also fitted with
indicator connections, reducing mo-
tion and all necessary accessories for
making complete tests of its opera-
tion.
The auxiliary equipment of the
plant will next be considered, and in
order to get the functions of the
various parts of the equipment
clearly in mind, the ammonia meas-
uring receiver will be described first.
This is an assembly of two vertical
cylinders and one inclined cylinder,
all of which are capable of with-
standing heavy pressures, each be-
ing provided with a guage-glass so
that the level of the ammonia liquid


57
in each may be readily determined.
The ammonia receiver serves as a
storage reservoir for the liquid am-
monia and also affords a means for
determining the amount of the li-
quid handled during a test. The
middle inclined cylinder is calibrat-
ed and provided with suitable valves
necessary in determining the amount
of liquid ammonia, and it is further
provided with a well in which to
insert a thermometer for determin-
ing the temperatures under which
the liquid ammonia is measured.
The liquid ammonia is then con-
veyed from the bottom vertical cyl-
inder through high pressure piping
to a specially designed valve, capa-
ble of giving a very fine control of
the liquid flow and known as an
"expansion-valve," and thence to a
brine-cooler of the double-pipe,
counter-flow type. The liquid am-
monia, after passing the expansion
valve, flows into the outer set of
pipes of the brine-cooler and into
a region of reduced pressure, thus
producing the refrigerating effect
desired with the consequent vapori-
zation of the ammonia liquid and
absorption of heat from the brine
which is circulated through the in-
ner set of pipes. The outer set of
pipes are known as the "expansion-
pipes." The double pipe construc-
tion is used because of its compact-
ness, durability and accessibility. It
consists of a series of standard
lengths of pipe, each length having
within it a pipe of the same length
but of smaller diameter, the whole
series of pipe lengths being so join-
ed by special return bends at their
ends that there is no liquid flow be-
tween the outer and inner' sets of
pipes, and thus two distinct circuits
are formed. The one through the
inner pipes is for the brine and the
one through the outer pipes for the
ammonia. It is thus apparent that
the only heat interchanges which
can take place between the ammo-
nia and brine must be through the
metal pipes themselves. The out-
let from the expansion pipes is con-
nected to the suction line leading
to the ammonia compressor. This
suction line is provided with all nec-
essary thermometer wells and valves
and is very thoroughly insulated
with cork pipe covering of the high-
est grade. This is to prevent the
absorption of heat by the cold am-
monia vapor on its way to the com-
pressor. After the ammonia vapor
has been compressed in the com-
pressor cylinder it is discharged in-
to a discharge line leading to the
outer set of pipes of a double-pipe,
counter-current ammonia condenser.
This pipe line is also heavily cov-
ered with the highest grade of cork
covering to prevent loss of heat by
the hot, compressed ammonia gas
and it is also provided with the nec-
essary thermometer wells and
valves.
In the double-pipe, counter-cur-
rent type of condenser and brine-
cooler, the liquids move in opposite
directions, this has the advantage
that in the brine-cooler the coldest
ammonia liquid and vapor absorb
heat from the warmest brine. In
the case of the ammonia condenser
the hottest cooling water absorbs
heat from the hottest ammonia gas,
and the coldest water absorbs heat
from the liquid ammonia which col-
lects in the bottom pipes, as well as
also absorbing heat from the cold-
est ammonia vapor. Thus it be-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
comes apparent that by this system
of heat interchange the most effi-
cient conditions of operation are re-
alized. The double-pipe type of heat
interchanger has the additional ad-
vantage that rapid circulation is eas-
ily obtained, and the cooling sur-
faces thus rendered highly efficient
in accordance with the experiment-
al fact that the amount of heat
transmitted per unit of area of sur-
face in contact with a liquid, gas,
or vapor, increases as some function
of the velocity of their flow over the
surface. This function of increase
of heat transmission is different for
each combination of surfaces and
fluids, but in all cases the amount
of heat transferred per unit area of
surface at any given temperature
conditions, increases with increased
velocity of the liquids, gases or va-
pors over them.
In the ammonia condenser the
the highly heated and compressed
ammonia gas is discharged into the
outer set of pipes in order to use
air cooling as much as is possible
and thus economize on the amount
of cooling water which is taken
from the city water mains. This
cooling water flows through the in-
ner series of pipes and after being
metered by an accurate Detroit me-
ter, manufactured by the Central
Station Steam Supply Co., of De-
troit, Mich.; it is then discharged
into the sewer. Thermometer wells
are also provided in which to insert
thermometers for obtaining the tem-
peratures of the ingoing and out-
going cooling water. All valves
necessary for controlling the amount
of cooling wrater flowing are pro-
vided. As the hot ammonia gas is
cooled and condensed to liquid am-
monia, it flows to the lower pipes
of the condenser, where it is still
further cooled, and from there it
flows to the top cylinder of the am-
monia measuring apparatus, from
there to be measured and used over
again.
The next part of the' plant which
will be considered is the equipment
pertaining to the brine circuit. The
brine used in this plant is composed
of calcium chloride, CaCl2, dissolved
in water. A stock of brine is kept
on hand which has a specific grav-
ity of 1.294; 30% of salt by weight
and a freezing point of -54.4 degrees
Fahrenhiet; in other words, it will
not freeze until 86.4 degrees Fahren-
heit below the freezing point on the
Fahrenheit scale, which is at 32 de-
grees. It is thus apparent that the
plant is capable of producing a sup-
ply of brine for experimental pur-
poses at a very low temperature.
The freezing-tank, which will be de-
scribed later, is provided with a
much greater quantity of brine of
approximately 1.024 gravity, having
3c/0 of the salt by weight and a
freezing point of 12 degrees Fahr-
enheit or 20 degrees Fahrenheit be-
low freezing. This brine is used
in icemaking and where a brine hav-
ing an extremely low freezing tem-
perature is not required.
The brine is circulated by means
of a Gould single acting triplex
pump, which is geared to a 200 volt,
direct-current motor of General
Electric make, shuntwoiind and
with a speed range of 550 to 2,200
R. P. M., power for which is sup-
plied by the university power sta-
tion. The brine pump discharge is
connected to the brine-cooler and
the brine, after passing through the
cooler, passes to a distributing man-


ifold, where it may be directed to
the freezing-tank, to an electric
heater or into a brine pipe line lead-
ing to the third floor. Here it is
used in refrigerating coils used to
produce low temperature in a suit-
ably designed chamber, to deter-
mine, experimentally, constants of
heat transmission of different build-
ing materials under different condi-
tions. Scales and tanks are pro-
vided so that the amount of brine
circulated may be accurately deter-
mined by weighing. Thermometer
wells are so placed that the temper-
atures of the brine entering and
leaving the brine-cooler may be ob-
tained. The brine pump suction
line is so arranged that brine may
be drawn from the freezing tank or
from the tank of brine which has
the very low freezing point.
In order to have a complete ice-
plant a freezing-tank is provided
and equipped with 35 ice-cans, each
with a capacity of 100 pounds, thus
giving a total freezing capacity at
one time of 3,500 pounds of 1J4
tons. The compressor, however, is
capable of handling a freezing-tank
making approximately 6*4 tons of
ice per 24 hours from water at or-
dinary temperatures. The brine-
tank is made of steel plate and is
carefully insulated by air spaces and
by standard insulation such as is
used in the construction of cold-sto-
rage chambers. The compartment
containing the brine-cooler is care-
fully insulated by similar construc-
tion and methods.
One of the novel features of the
plant is the method of supplying
heat to the brine, by means of which
the heat is transferred to the mix-
ture of liquid ammonia and ammo-
nia vapor in the expansion-pipes. In
ordinary cold-storage practice, the
heat in the articles to be refrigerat-
ed is given up to the surrounding
air, which in turn gives it up to the
refrigerating coils, and they in turn
to the brine circulating through
them. By means of this brine the
heat is carried to the brine-cooler
and given up to the metal of the
inner pipes of the brine-cooler,
which in turn gives it up to the
mixture of ammonia liquid and va-
por in the extension pipes. In or-
dinary can ice-plant practice the heat
is taken from the water in the cans
by the brine circulating around the
cans and the above process carried
out. A slight consideration of the
many variables entering in and the
opportunities for errors in determin-
ing the amount of heat absorbed by
the brine will at once make appa-
rent the advantages of having a
concentrated source of heat supply
to the brine which is capable of very
accurate determination as to the
amount supplied in a given time.
Ease of control is also very essen-
tial. An electric brine heater has
finally been developed for supplying
this heat which gives a very easily
controlled and definite heat supply.
The chamber containing the heat-
ing elements is made of wood with
air-spaces to afford good thermal
insulation. This chamber is brine
tight and is connected in the brine
circuit in such a manner that the
brine-cooler, electric heater and
brine pump form a closed circuit.
The heating elements themselves
are of special design and construc-
tion and are 6 in number. Each
element has 50 feet of No. 32 B. &amp;
S. gauge* michrome resistance rib-
bon, inch wide and 0.008 inch
thick, wound around a strip of tran-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
site asbestos wood, 36" long, Hi"
wide and thick. The edges of
the strip of asbestos wood are slot-
ted to allow for the linear expansion
of the resistance ribbon when heat-
ed.
All bolts passing through the as-
bestos wood are bushed with built-
up mica washers in order to give
high insulation resistance to the
heating elements. Heavy copper
terminals are brought out from each
heating element for the purpose of
connecting the resistance ribbon to
the power circuit. Flexible mican-
ite plate of 0.005 inch thickness is
placed between the resistance rib-
bon and the metal jacket for insula-
tion, after which the jacket, which
is made of No. 22 B. &amp; S. gauge
galvanized iron, is soldered up and
thoroughly tested for leaks. The
resistance of the nichrome resist-
ance ribbon in each heating element
is 4.283 ohms at 75 degrees Fahren-
heit, and when the heating elements
are in operation in the electric heat-
er, each one is designed to dissipate
10 K. W. or 34120 B. T. U. per hour.
The heating elements are designed
to operate at 220 volts and draw
45.5 amperes of current. Power for
their operation is supplied by the
university power station or by the
turbo-generator sets in the mechan-
ical laboratory, or by both sources,
as is convenient. To operate the
refrigerating plant at its rated ca-
pacity of 13 tons of refrigeration at
the standard A. S. M. E. conditions
of 185 pounds per square inch gauge
condenser pressure and 15.67
pounds per square inch gauge suc-
tion pressure, requires that electri-
cal power shall be supplied contin-
uously to the electric heater at the
rate of 45.7 K. XV. At 220 volts
this requires a current of 207.5 am-
peres. In order to provide overload
capacity and reserve heating ele-
ments, the heater is provided with
(i heating elements, this giving a ca-
pacity sufficient to dissipate 60 K.
W. continuously. At 220 volts this
capacity requires a current of 272.7
amperes and the heat dissipated per
hour amounts to 204,720 B. T. U.
Some of the experimental testing
for which the plant is well adapted
and equipped will now be discussed.
Aside from the fact that most all
steam driven refrigerating plants in
commercial service are equipped
with Corliss engines, it was desired
to have a representative type of Cor-
liss engine in the mechanical labo-
ratory and this was one of the im-
portant reasons for adopting this
form of prime-mover for this plant.
As stated before, the Corliss engine
is completely equipped for testing
and may be operated without ope-
rating the compressor by merely
disconnecting the compressor con-
necting-rod, thus rendering the en-
gine adaptable for use in any form
of engine test.
Many special tests may be car-
ried out with the equipment for de-
termining the efficiencies of the va-
rious elements of the refrigerating
equipment. The double-pipe, coun-
ter-current condenser affords excel-
lent means for determining heat
transfer coefficients under various
rates of gas and fluid flow, also a
study of the conditions resulting
from the parallel flow of gases and
liquids in double-pipe heat inter-
changers. Distribution of heat loss-
es and heat absorption in piping
systems furnishes a fertile field for
further investigation. The refng-


61
erating plant is used in connection
with a specially designed and cali-
brated refrigerating chamber, the
interior of which is kept cooled to
any degree desired by means of
cooled brine, thus enabling coeffi-
cients of heat transmission to be de-
termined for various building mate-
rials or combinations of building
materials under temperature condi-
tions which are the same as those
encountered in actual practice. The
application of mechanical refrigera-
tion in various branches of industry
is growing very rapidly and the out-
look for this field of mechanical en-
gineering is more promising than
ever. The whole field of the me-
chanical production of cold is one
of the most fascinating and interest-
ing branches of mechanical engi-
neering.


KARL F. KEELER, '15E
The function of an automatic headgate in irrigation is to automatically
regulate the flow of a stream of water which is diverted from a source such
as a reservoir or canal into a canal or lateral ditch.
The contract, agreement or understanding between an irrigation com-
pany and the farmer usually stipulates that the company furnish the farmer
a certain number of sec. ft. of water for a certain number of acres of land
during the irrigation season, or a certain number of acre feet per acre per
season, or a certain number of acre feet per acre per hundred days, or some
such stipulation, in which it is agreed that the company furnish the farmer
a given quantity of water in a given time. Payment is made on the basis
of this quantity.
A headgate is an orifice or notch of limited dimensions which can be
opened and closed. Therefore the problem of the irrigation company be-
comes to deliver a given quantity of water through an orifice or notch of
known dimensions in a given time. The ordinary headgate now in use is so
constituted that when adjusted the dimensions of the orifice or notch remain
constant until adjusted again.
The quantity (Q.) of water which will pass through an orifice or notch
in a given time is expressed sufficiently accurately for our purpose as fol-
lows: O. is directly proportional to the area (A) and to the square root of
the head \/H, i. e., Q — CA VH. H for the notch equals the distance from
the bottom of the notch to the level of the water surface in the source, and
H for the orifice equals the distance from the center of gravity of the orifice
to the water surface of the source.
Now let us assume a canal from which is being diverted, into lateral
ditches, two streams of water, one through a notch, say one foot wide
extending from the level of the bottom of the canal to above the water sur-
face in the canal and the other through an orifice say one foot square with
its lower edge level with the bottom of the canal. Let the water in the
lateral ditches flow away freely. Diagram, P'ig. i, shows how the discharge
in sec. ft. varies through these headgates at different depths of the water in
the main canal. Xow further assume that the water in the canal is 1.8 feet
deep and that the water-master desires to divert 5j4 sec. ft. through the
orifice headgate and 7% sec. ft. through the notch headgate. He will then
adjust the gates as described, i. e., the orifice gate to one foot square and
the notch to one foot wide.
For various reasons in actual practice it rarely happens, especially in
smaller canals, that the water surface at any given point along a canal remains
at constant height for any length of time. Now if for any cause whatso-
ever the water surface in the canal rises or falls say 2 feet it will be seen that
the discharge through the orifice will increase or decrease V2 sec. ft. and
•The device described is the invention of Mr. Keeler, and was perfected in both
its crude and finished forms in the Hydraulic Laboratory of the University of Mich-
igan.

through the notch 1% sec. ft. But J/i sec. ft. equals approximately one
acre foot per day, and one acre foot is half enough water for an acre of
land during the season.
From this assumed case we can see that the requirements of an auto-
matic headgate are that it shall allow the passage of a constant stream of
water regardless of the level of the water surface in the source. It will also
be recognized that cheapness, simplicity and durability should be controlling
features of the device.
The contrivance first conceived was as shown in Fig. 2 and described
below. It consists of two sides of the form shown at A connected by a
back B and bottom F, thus forming a pocket accessible to the water from in
front. This pocket, or gate as we shall call it, is supported from behind by
mm

Discharge in Second Feet
Fig.l.
four rollers as shown at C, against which the edges D of the gate roll. The
rollers C are pivoted to the walls of the channel. The gate is supported
vertically by springs as shown at $.
By virtue of the manner in which the gate is supported it will be seen
that, if the gate should gradually increase in weight the springs would
gradually elongate, the gate would gradually lower, and the size of the
orifice under the gate would gradually decrease. This is practically what
happens when the water rises in front of the gate.
The bottom of the gate channel is set on a slope sufficient to give the
water passing through it a velocity of about 2l/2 feet per second, so that
Q sec. ft. are flowing under the gate when the water is just passing freely
under the bottom of the lip L. The gate channel is l/&amp; inch wider than the
gate so that there is 1-1G inch clearance on both sides of the gate (see
Fig. 4)-
The gates investigated at the Hydraulic Laboratory of the University
of Michigan were set in a channel one foot wide and were to deliver a con-
stant stream of one second foot. Fig. 5 shows a partial section through the


65
gate along the center line of the channel. The gate was set so that the water
just passed freely under its lip when one second foot was flowing. Then the
quantity flowing to the gate was slightly increased and the surface of the
water as it rose struck the projecting lip and piled up in front as shown in
Fig. 5. The effect of the contraction caused by the 2-inch vertical lip was
found sufficient to compensate for the increased head and Q remained equal
to one sec. ft. The quantity flowing to the gate having been slightly in-
creased above one sec. ft. and the quantity passing the gate being kept equal
to one sec. ft. the water began to rise slowly in front of the gate. As it
rose above the top of the lip it flowed into the gate thus increasing the
weight to be supported by the springs, consequently the springs elongated
and the gate lowered, decreasing the size of the orifice sufficiently to com-
pensate for the increased head, and Q still equaled one sec. ft. In this same
manner the water passing the gate was kept constant as the water rose in
front to an elevation three feet above the bottom of the channel. Then the
quantity flowing to the gate was decreased slightly below one sec. ft. and the
water surface in front of the gate began to lower. As it lowered the weight
to be supported by the springs decreased and the gate rose and the area of
the orifice was thus increased to compensate for the loss of head. In this
same manner the quantity passing the gate was kept equal to one sec. ft.
until the water surface in front of the gate was down to the bottom of the
lip, i. e., 4 deep in the channel.
It will be seen that the amount the gate lowers per unit rise in head
depends upon the amount of water the gate contains per unit rise in head at
the given elevation of water surface; but, the width of the gate being


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
constant, the amount of water it will hold per unit rise in head at a given
elevation depends on the depth of the gate at that elevation, i. e., the abscissa
of the gate curve at that elevation. We must, then, obtain a curve for the
back of the gate such that its abscissa at any given ordinate will be pro-
portional to the amount the gate should lower per unit rise in head at that
elevation (ordinate). We can obtain this curve mathematically. Referring
to Fig. 6 let bb represent the bottom of the channel and YOX the gate
hanging in place, WS the water surface, x the abscissa of the gate curve at
the level of the water surface, y the distance from the bottom of the gate to
the water surface, a the height of the orifice under the gate, H the head on
the center of gravity of the orifice under the gate, H the head on the center
of gravity of the orifice, L the width of the orifice, V the volume of water
contained in the gate.
Fig. S.
Then, since the width of the orifice is constant, we may write in place
of Q = CA VH. Q = CLa VH and, since Q is also to remain constant,
we can combine the constant terms and write
a = KH-Y2 (i)
Further, the gate is supported vertically in such a manner (by springs) that
the change of a will be proportional to
x dy — — k da (2)
We also have
y = H — a/2 (3)
Now the equation of the curve we are seeking must be an equation in x and y
based on conditions (1), (2) and (3)
From (1)
da= — V2KH-*r-dH
and from (1) and (3)
y-.H — K/2 H-1/1
then
dy = dH + % KH-y* dH; dy={i + yAKH"V2) dH
From (2)
(x + ;4 K H-*/*x) dH=(V2Kk H-y-) dH

x + yAK H-y*x =y2Kk H-y&gt;

or
— y4 K H-*/*x+y2Kk h-*p -. x
or
H-*/*[y2Kk—y4Kx] =x
or
H=[{y2 Kk — %Kx)/x\Y
and
H-y =[x/('/2 Kk — %Kx)]Y
Therefore from (3) we have
y=[y2 Kk — yA Kx]-'/•&lt;— K/2 [x/y2 Kk — H Kx] V3
or
y = [(* — 2/3 x)/2x*n*/{V2 Kk~% Kx)]Y
which is the equation of the curve sought.
The curve is seen to depend on the value of K and k.
From (2) we see that k = — xdy/da or k equals the change in volume
of water in the gate per unit change of a, therefore k is the stiffness of the
supporting springs, i. e., the weight of water required to cause unit elonga-
tion of the springs. Therefore, it will be seen that we can multiply the
abscissa of the gate curve by any amount if we also multiply the stiffness
of our springs by the same amount. But, by multiplying the abscissae of the
gate curve by any number, we multiply the volume of water taken into the
gate per unit change in depth-in-gate by the same number. Hence it will be
seen that by changing the value of k the value of the two opposing forces—
the weight of water in the gate and the force exerted by the distorted springs
—is changed. Now in the operation of the gate there is a certain amount of
frictional resistance in the rollers which opposes the movement of the gate,
and this friction is independent of the value of k. But the two opposing
forces—the weight of water in the gate and the force exerted by the dis-
torted springs—which are brought to bear in overcoming this frictional
resistance are dependent on the value of k. Therefore the value of k depends
on the frictional resistance of the rollers or in other words the abscissae of
the gate curve depend on the value of the frictional resistance of the rollers.
The value of K depends on the value of C in the formula Q — CA \AH
but the value of C varies with the character of the orifice and with the head.
The orifice we are dealing with is as shown in Fig. 4. Since values of C for
this kind of an orifice are not available it would be necessary to determine
them by experiment. A series of experiments were accordingly carried out.
But, instead of determining from these experiments the value of C and
using equation (4) above for obtaining the gate curve, the following method
was used.
The mean curve of a number of sets of independent observation were
obtained. See Fig. 7. This curve shows how the gate opening varies with
the depth—in—gate, i: e., above bottom of lip.
The change in gate-opening per unit change in depth-in-gate between
any two points (elevation in water surface) is proportional to the depth of
the gate i. e., the mean abscissa of the gate curve between those points, or, in
other words the slope of this curve at any point with respect to the depth-in-
gate axis is proportional to the abscissa of the gate curve at that same point.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The method folowed in plotting the gate curve from the gate-opening
depth-in-gate curve was as follows: In the region of the curve where the
difference in gate opening per unit increase of depth-in-gate is the greatest,
divide the difference in gate opening per unit increase of depth into twenty
equal parts and make a scale A of paper with these twenty divisions as
graduations on it. Make another scale B of a length equal to the maximum

gate ordinate desired and divide this scale into twenty equal parts. With A
measure the difference in gate-opening between any two points of gate depth
and with B lay off the same number of divisions as mean gate ordinate
between these two points.
A gate built in accordance with the results of these experiments was
tested with the following results:
Q= 1.026 sec. ft. maximum variation in flow equals .0458 x Q or Q
remained constant within 4.58%.


PROF. J. E. EMSWILER
Notwithstanding the inherently
high thermal efficiency of the inter-
nal combustion engine, the steam
prime mover continues, not only to
hold its own, but to advance in de-
velopment with more rapid strides
than its competitor. In this devel-
opment, both the steam reciprocat-
ing engine, and the steam turbine
have participated. In the steam en-
gine field, the application of the Uni-
flow principle to the reciprocating
engine, which many engineers had
thought to have reached its limit in
practical improvement, has offered a
new and promising avenue of devel-
opment. In the steam turbine field,
the past year has witnessed the in-
stallation of the largest capacity
prime mover that has heretofore
been constructed, in the 25,000 K.
W. turbo-generator for the Com-
monwealth Edison Co. of Chicago.
This will soon be surpassed by the
appearance of a 30,000 K. W. unit
which is now under construction.
This surprising growth in capacity
has been accomplished by improve-
ments in design, which have enabled
turbine manufacturers to guarantee
steam consumption of 11.25 pounds
of steam per K. W. per hour, or
even less, which is the equivalent
of over 25 per cent thermal efficiecy.
The field of usefulness of the
steam turbine has been widened by
the successful application of gearing
of large capacity whereby the speed
of the turbine can be reduced. By
its use, the turbine has been made
available for the operation of direct
current generators, belt drives, roll-
ing mill work, and the propulsion
of moderate speed ships. It is to be
noted in addition, that electrical and
hydraulic speed reduction are being
used in marine work.
The happy combination which
unites the high thermal efficiency of
the reciprocating engine in the high
pressure steam range, with the high
efficiency of the turbine in the low
pressure range, is being applied
more and more to meet the increased
power demands on reciprocating en-
gine plants. The use of the com-
bined unit has also extended to ma-
rine work, where the reversibility
of the engine presents an additional
desirable feature. Complete new in-
stallations of these combined units
on land have even been reported.
Perhaps the most revolutionary
proposition to be offered for the ele-
vation of efficiency of heat engines,
since the invention of the steam en-
gine itself, is the proposed binary
vapor unit which is being developed
by the General Electric Co. The
conception is not new, but it has
never before been put to actual trial.
The fact that a large corporation,
with unlimited means and excellent-
engineering talent, is behind the
scheme, offers assurance that it will
be given a thorough test to deter-
mine its practicability. Should the
practical difficulties in handling the
mercury be successfully overcome, it
is expected that a unit of this type
will reach a thermal efficiency as
high as 35 per cent or even better,
which is a figure difficult to equal,
even with a Diesel engine.


OF MICHIGAN
H. I. MARKEY, 1911 E
The new power house of the University, now nearly completed,
at a cost of about $325,000, stands as an example of the latest type of
power house construction, and takes the place of the now out of date
and heavily overloaded plant which has been in continuous service since
1894. Its location, some few hundred feet northeast of the old "cat
hole," puts it within easy reach of both the Michigan Central and the
campus, and in view of the probable direction of future growth of the
University, the site seems well selected indeed. Pleasing to the eye
with its dark red brick walls and artificial stone foundations, surmounted
by the radial brick stack standing 175 feet above the grates, it is at the
same time absolutely fireproof in construction.
PURPOSE OF THE PLANT
It has been designed to produce energy in the form of heat, elec-
tricity, and compressed air, in the most economical and efficient manner,
and distribute it to the various points of demand. High pressure steam
will be required for laboratory use and for the operation of prime mov-
ers in the production of electrical energy. Low pressure steam will be
required for heating. Hot water will be required for domestic service,
gymnasiums, and hospitals. Compressed air will be required for the
operation of thermostats in connection with the heating system. Alter-
nating current will be required at 2,300 volts for general distribution, at
110 volts for lighting and at 220 volts for power. Direct current at
125 volts, 250 volts, and 500 volts will also be required.
The building proper occupies a ground space of 10C/ 6" by 193' fi",
and consists of the engine room and boiler room. In addition to this
an outside coal storage is provided parallel to the boiler room, and above
which the spur track from the M. C. R. R. is elevated, on concrete piers.
THE ENGINE ROOM
The inner walls of the engine room are of a buff colored brick; the
lower five feet faced with white enameled tile. The floor is of red tile.
Excellent lighting is secured in the day time by large windows on
three sides of the room, the sash being of steel, opened or closed by
chains from the floor. 400 watt tungstens will furnish light at night.
Steel columns encased in brick support the steel roof trusses, crane
rails, and the reinforced concrete and tile roof.
The equipment in the engine room at present consists of an Allis-
Chalmers cross-compound engine direct connected to a 625 K. V. A.
generator, producing 3-phasc, 10-cycle alternating current at 2,300 volts.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The engine is a non-condensing 24" and 36" by 36" operating at 125 lbs.
steam pressure and 120 R. P. M. It is of the double eccentric type,
inlet and exhaust valves being separately operated, so that it is possible
to carry large overloads. Steam is supplied through a large radius
bend sweeping down from the header in boiler room to a separator,
and thence to the engine. Foundations for a second similar unit are
now in place.
A 150 K. W. motor generator set consisting of a 2,300 volt synch-
ronous motor, and a 250 volt D. C. generator, will convert part of this
energy to direct current.
Two 25 K. W. steam turbine driven exciters of the Fatitz impulse
type running at 3,600 R. P. M. generate current at 125 volts.
The switch board will be located along the east side of the engine
room. All transformers and oil switches will be placed in the basement
directly below the board. Four transformers will be installed now,
three 100 ,K. V. A. single phase, 220 volt for power service in the power
house, and one 15 K. V. A. single phase, 110 volt for power house
lighting.
Two 2,000 H. P. Cochrane Open Feed Water Heaters occupy
rather a conspicuous place on the main floor, elevated to give gravity
feed to the feed pumps in the basement. These heaters will furnish
both boiler feed water for domestic service. The Heaters are supplied
from a hot well located at the entrance to the tunnel, in the south west
corner of the boiler room, and into which all the returns from the cam-
pus heating system flow by gravity. Two vertical centrifugal pumps
are used for this purpose, each being driven by a Fairbanks-Morse 15
H. P., 2,300 volt motor. Makeup water will be furnished at present
from the city mains through a differential valve. Weir type recording
meters will measure the total water delivered to the Heaters.
The engine room is heated by hot air drawn through an American
Blower Co. 'Vento' Heater by a No. 8 Sirocco Fan and delivered
through galvanized ducts, located in the boiler room, to registers in
the wall between the engine and boiler room.
A Shaw 15 ton hand operated traveling crane spans the engine
room and selves for erection and repairs.
THE BOILER ROOM
Eight 400 horse power Wickes Vertical Water Tube Boilers set in
batteries of two each, supply steam at 150 pounds gage pressure. These
units are the last word in boiler construction, being erected in steel
jacket settings; all drums, heads, man-hole covers and crabs, hand hole
plates, etc., being of pressed steel- absolutely no cast steel or cast iron
being used in their manufacture. A steel gallery runs along the front of
the boilers for the inspection of the water columns and gage glasses.
The products of combustion are led into a concrete breeching below
the floor, and thence in both directions to the centrally located stack.


73
The latter is of radial brick, 10' inside diameter by 175' height above
the grates. A hand operated damper in the stack controls the draft.
Each battery has a dutch oven front, and is equipped with Murphy
Automatic Stokers, driven by a variable speed motor. The boiler
stop valves are 1" Crane Y type Automatic Stop Check Valves, which
in case of several tubes breaking and relieving the pressure, automati-
cally close and prevent high pressure steam from returning to the boiler
from the header.
The Header is supported on ball bearing rollers on the steel mezza-
nine floor at the rear of the boilers. Expansion is taken care of by
long radius bends. From this header steam is supplied to the power
units, feed pumps, etc. A reducing pressure valve serves to reduce the
pressure for the heating service.
Two Jeansville Iron Works Co. centrifugal pumps located in the
basement serve as feed pumps. Each unit consists of one double
stage pump delivering at 160 pounds pressure for boiler feed, and one
single stage pump delivering at 75 pounds pressure for domestic ser-
vice, direct connected to a Terry steam turbine running 2,750 R. P. M.
at 120 pounds pressure. A spacer plate enables the domestic service
pump to be disconnected at any time and the feed pump run alone.
These pumps are fed by gravity from the Heaters directly above them.
The boiler feed pumps deliver into two entirely independent lines run-
ning along the mezzanine floor in the Boiler Room, from which the
boilers are fed, from either line.
ASH HANDLING SYSTEM
The ashes are dumped through the stoker grates into the receiving
hoppers below, and are thence carried by suction up into the 12 ton
Ash Bunker supported on steel columns and girders over the railroad
spur outside of the boiler room. Here they are wet down as they
enter. The suction is produced by a General Electric Co. Centrifugal
Air Compressor giving a 1.5 pound pressure (or vacuum.) It is di-
rect-connected to a 30 II. P. Induction motor running at 3,450 R. P. M.
The capacity of the system is 300 pounds of dry ashes per minute.
From the Ash Bunker the ashes are deliered directly into railroad cars
on the siding below and hauled away.
COAL HANDLING SYSTEM
Coal is to be brought from the M. C. R. R. tracks to the Power
House by a 4,000 foot spur track. This track will serve also to haul
supplies to the University Store House behind the Homeopathic Hos-
pital. A 30 ton electric locomotive will haul the coal, operating from
a third rail at the coal storage end of the line, and from an overhead
trolley system the remainder of the distance. The coal will be un-
loaded by a three and one-half ton electric traveling crane, equipped
with a grab bucket, and dumped into either the storage or the bunkers.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The outside storage is of 6000 tons capacity. At the power house
end of the crane, and integral with it, is a Link Belt Coal Crusher,
electrically operated, which crushes the coal before dumping it into
the bunkers. The steel coal bunkers are of 325 tons capacity, sup-
ported on steel columns over the boiler room and extending the full
length of the Power House. From them coal is delivered to an elec-
tric traveling hopper, which weighs the charge of coal and dumps it
into the stoker hoppers of any furnace desired.
THE TUNNEL
The tunnel connecting the power house with the substation, !o-
cated between the gymnasium and the medical building, is 1,550 feet
long, about 10 feet high, and of concrete. It will contain for the pres-
ent one 20 inch low pressure steam main, one 8 inch high pressure
steam main, one 6 inch hot water main, one 8 inch return main, and
a 2 inch compressed air line. All pipes are supported on brackets
carrying ball bearing rollers, along the wall. Expansion is to be
entirely taken up by the long bends in the pipe at curves in the tun-
nel; it is the intention to give the pipe an initial tension lengthwise
before steam is turned through them. Power cables will be carried
in vitrefied conduit below the walk through the tunnel. One 2.300
volt, 3 phase, 3 conductor, No. 2-0 lead armored cable will be insfilled
now.
PROVISION FOR FUTURE GROWTH
The growth of the plant will be taken care of by extending the
building ioo feet to the north, giving room for a total of 16-400 H. P.
boilers, or 6400 boiler horsepower. A second stack of the same dimen-
sions as the present one will then be erected. Two more 625 K. Y.
A. generators will be added, one being driven by a Corliss engine, and
the other by a steam turbine, with a surface condenser and a cooling
tower to be used when the demand for exhaust steam is small. This
condenser will be so installed as to be available for testfng any oik
of the units. An additional motor generator set of 150 K. W. ca pac-
ity, transformers, etc., will be added as necessary.
The water supply will ultimately be obtained by an electrically
operated pumping station to be erected near the river, delivering
water through underground pipe lines. A water softener will also be
installed.
Smith, Hinchman &amp; Grylls. Detroit, Mich., are the architects and
engineers for the plant. Mr. H. L. Walton, '08e, assistant engineer
for the company, has had general charge of the work. Mr. S. W.
Crocker is the resident engineer.

EDITORIAL
THE NEW TECHNIC.
This issue marks the commence-
ment of what the present board
hopes will prove a new era in the
history of the Michigan Technic.
Before undertaking the publication
of the present volume, the board in-
vestigated thoroughly the condi-
tions surrounding the Technic, in
the attempt to determine, if possi-
ble, the reasons underlying its fail-
ures and successes in the past. As
a result of these investigations a
new plan of reorganization of both
the Technic and Engineering Soci-
ety was drawn up and approved by
the Engineering Society, and passed
by the Standing Committee of the
Faculty. This issue marks the first
appearance of the Technic under the
new order of things. A discussion
of the plan of reorganization will be
found elsewhere.
Several departures and changes
will be found between these covers.
The Technic was originally year-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
ly, then semi-yearly, later quarterly,
and finally, last year the attempt
was made to publish it monthly.
The latter attempt was hardly a
success from any viewpoint, in that
it took up too much of the time of
the students getting it out, mailing
the copies and collecting advertis-
ing, before the next issue came
around. As a yearly or even semi-
yearly publication the paper is not
a success from a business stand-
point, as advertising is difficult to
collect for more than one issue at
a time. Not only this, but interest
is not held up by having it appear
so seldom. Therefore, after careful
consideration of all these points and
numerous others, and in view of the
fact that the paper has been most
successful when published as a quar-
terly, the present board offers the
Technic as a quarterly as the best
solution to this difficult problem.
The cover of the Technic is
changed this year, incorporating the
table of contents where its logical
place should be: on the front cover
where it may be first to strike the
eye. What is it in a magazine that
sells it if not the contents? There-
fore, it is hoped that this change
from the old order will be approved
by our readers, not orrty-because of
its usefulness, but because it makes
the Technic appear in its true light;
that of an Engineering Magazine.
The size of the pages of the Tech-
nic has varied from year to year,
with no apparent reason. From
henceforth, the present size is of-
fered as the best adapted to the
needs of the articles used in the
Technic, and still keep its size such
that it may be conveniently bound
into volumes.
From all the changes incorporated
in this issue, it may be seen that
the ambition of the present board is
to standardize the Technic; to put
it on a running basis that will not
fluctuate from year to year as it
has in the past, but which will es-
tablish a precedent to be followed
by coming boards in years to come,
and thus make the Michigan Tech-
nic what it should be, and with the
hearty co-operation of all, will be:
the official organ of the Engineer-
ign Department of the University
of Michigan.
OUR POLICY
The primary function of the
Michigan Technic is to act as a
bond or cable between the Univer-
sity, with its Faculty and Students,
and those who have passed out in-
to the world of Engineering. There
is no other medium that may serve
so well the purpose of uniting the
interests and welfare of the Grad-
uates to their Alma Mater in gen-
eral, and to their Engineering De-
partment in particular, as the Mich-
igan Technic.
The tendency in the past few
years seems to have been to make
a strictly technical paper out of the
Technic; in this way the Alumni
and Departmental affairs have been
slighted to a more or less extent.
It is the aim of the present board
to re-establish the Technic on a
firmer footing with the Department
and the Alumni; forget about the
altogether practical things that a
technical paper is supposed to in-
herit, and strive to make it a pub-
lication in which the alumni may


77
find out what their classmates of
long ago are doing, what the stu-
dents of the present day are doing,
and last, but not least, what the De-
partment is doing.
The board has done its best to
collect all the alumni news of inter-
est that could be obtained, but
found that sources were limited.
Now that a start has been made,
however, help us to keep the col-
umns of the Technic live with news
of the doings of the alumni, so that
not only the "old boys" can read
and enjoy, but so the present gen-
eration may learn what the gradu-
ates of their school are doing.
The active co-operation of the
alumni is extremely necessary in
carrying out the policy outlined
above. By taking a moment or two
sometime to drop a line to the office,
giving us some news, some encour-
agement or some friendly advice,
they will be not only helping the
men in charge of the Technic, but
will be assisting in the formation of
a powerful chain between the Alum-
ni and the Engineering Department.
A WORD TO THE ALUMNI
In reading over this issue of the
Technic, and after considering all
its good points and bad points, do
not forget that the success and qual-
ity of a magazine are dependent al-
most entirely on the interest and
support that it receives from its
subscribers. How many of you who
are reading this issue are subscrib-
ers? Not very many. How many
of you ought to be subscribers? Ev-
ery one of you, if you have real
love for your Alma Mater at heart.
Now, in consideration of the new
plan for publication upon which the
Technic is basing its fondest hopes
for success, and in consideration of
the changes that have been made in
its make-up, is it not worthy of the
earnest support of every one of you
alumni? We ask this question, Man
to Man! You, who have gone out
into the world, have no means of
keeping in close touch with the work
of the Department. Why not make
the Technic that means of keeping
old memories fresh and sweet?
Now, if you like this issue of the
Technic, fill out the subscription
blank enclosed and send it in. If
you don't like this issue, send in
your subscription anyway, and tell
us where to improve the Technic.
Co-operation is the secret of suc-
cess in making the Technic u.ean
what it should to the Engineering
Department.
ENGINEERING SOCIETY
Owing to the fact that the final
plans for the Engineering Society
as a complete whole, including the
branch organizations, have not yet
been drawn up, it has been thought
advisable to postpone its publication
until the next issue. The October
issue of the Technic will have a
complete discussion of the entire
plan.
COMPLETE RECORD OF ARTICLES BY
FACULTY AND ALUMNI
As one of the functions of the
New Technic, an attempt will be
made to keep a record of all the ar-
ticles, papers, talks, etc , written or
presented by the alumni and faculty
of the University. These will be
printed in the Technic for each en-
suing quarter, and a complete file
kept in the office to which reference
may be made at any time.


THE MICH1GAS TECH SIC
It is desired of the alumni and
faculty that they bear this in mind,
and keep the Technic informed of
any papers or speeches of which
they may hear. It is only by this
means that the work may be car-
ried out as planned. Copies of ar-
ticles, reprints, etc., will be appre-
ciated for the file in the offices of
the Technic.
PLAN FOR A WORKING FUND
With the donation of $100 by Otto
J. Klotz, '72, as a nucleus, a work-
ing fund for the Technic has been
started. The object of this working
fund is to give the Technic a cer-
tain capital by means of which it
may pull through the times of pub-
lication without incurring heavy
drains on the Society. At such
times all the money is going out to
pay for cuts, printing, circulars, let-
ters, etc., and the money from ad-
vertising has not yet begun to come
in. In order that the Technic may
take advantage of cash discounts,
it is desirable that there be a
certain fund upon which it may
draw in times of need. As time
goes on, it is planned that a certain
part of the proceeds of the Technic
will be set aside for such purposes.
Let it be distinctly understood
that this money is not going to be
used to pay off any debt incurred
in printing the Technic. Such is
not its purpose, as outlined in the
foregoing paragraph.
It is hoped that there may be
more like Mr. Klotz who will see
their way clear to help insure the
Technic at least a fair and square
start at each issue, and thus do away
with the uncertainty that always ac-
companys its going to press at such
times.
SENIOR ENGINEERS
Soon after this issue of the Tech-
nic is off the press, you will be out
in the world, working and striving
for the glory of your Alma Mater.
You will be separated from your
classmates made in your four years
of study. Would you not like to
be able to know that the Technic
would be coming to your address
regularly, and that it would have
news of your classmates; what they
are doing; where they are; what
positions they are holding? Would
it not be worth the price of a sub-
scription to you to know all these
things about your classmates? And
would you not be interested in
knowing what the Department was
doing; what new apparatus and
buildings it is installing; what its
research departments are doing, etc..
etc.?
In order that you may have a
Technic that will do all these things,
and more, for you, it is necessary
that we not only have your good
faith, but that we also receive your
subscription. Try to make it a point
to attend to this before you leave
Ann Arbor.
The staff wishes to take advan-
tage of the space offered here to
thank all those who, by their kindly
help and criticism, helped make this
issue what it is. The contributors
are especially thanked for their ar-
ticles, all of which are worthy of
note.
It is hoped that the advertisers in
this issue will receive due consid-
eration and attention from the read-
ers, for, without them, the Technic
would not be what it is today.


Frank C. Emerson, '04 Engineer,
formerly a resident of Saginaw,
Mich., has been a resident of Wy-
oming since shortly after gradua-
tion. His first location in Wyoming
was in the town of Cora, a thriv-
ing center consisting of general
store, blacksmith shop and a com-
bined ranch- and road-house, locat-
ed 100 miles from a railroad. Upon
his arrival Cora did not appear to
be an especially attractive place for
an ambitious engineer to start prac-
tice, and, from a strictly engineer-
ing standpoint, it did not prove to
be such at any time later, even
though the tributary country was
found to be much larger and more
resourceful than the trading center
would seem to indicate. Work in
his chosen profession was not very
abundant in the locality, and there
seemed but little demand for talents
in the engineering line during the
fall and winter. In order to occu-
py his time more fully he accepted
an offer to run the Cora general
merchandise store during the win-
ter, and this employment, combined
with such surveying work as he
could drum up from time to time,
kept him fairly well occupied until
he was called to the State Engi-
neer's Office in May of the follow-
ing spring.
In outlining his experience at
Cora, Mr. Emerson states that it
was not without its benefit to him,
even though the time seemed rather
wasted from an engineering stand-
point, for the work at Cora enabled
him to gain an intimate knowledge
of the new country, its conditions
and its people, that could not have
been better gained in any other way,
and the information was invaluable
in connection with his future prac-
tice in the state.
After six weeks in the State En-
gineer's Office, under Mr. C. T.
Johnson, now at the University, Mr.
Emerson accepted the work of canal
and reservoir location for the La
Prele Ditch and Reservoir Company
at Douglas, Wyoming, spending the
summer of 1905 on this work. His
first and only experience in rail-
road work followed, when he was
transitman in charge of party on
the location of the Saratoga and En-
campment R. R., a branch from the
Union Pacific, into south-central
Wyoming. In March of 1906 he
left the railroad work to take
charge, for the state, of the location
of canals out of the Big Wind River
for the irrigation of lands in the
ceded portion of the Shoshone In-
dian Reservation. This location
work completed, he returned to the
La Prele Ditch, a canal of 350 sec-
ond-feet capacity designed to re-
claim lands west of and continuous
to the town of Douglas. This work
he left in April, 1907, to take charge
of the development work of the Wy-
oming Land and Irrigation Com-
pany in the Big Horn Basin, with
which company he is still connected.
Mr. James H. Herron, of the class
of 1909, has contributed a very in-
teresting article which will appear in
the next issue. He took the degree of
Mechanical Engineer and has since
specialized in Metallurgical work al-
most exclusively, holding at present


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the position of Consulting Metallur-
gical Engineer, with offices in Cleve-
land.
He has the unique distinction of
being the first to make rolled win-
dow sash in this country. He be-
longs to a number of societies;
among these are: A. S. M. E, Am-
erican Chemical Society, Iron and
Steel Institute of Great Britain, Am-
erican Society and International As-
sociation for Testing Materials, So-
ciety of Automobile Engineers, and
The Cleveland Engineering Society,
of which latter he is a director. He
is also General Manager of the Na-
tional Tool Builders' Association.
Previous to holding his present
position he was Asst. Engr. Cam-
bria Steel Co.. Johnstown, Pa.,
Chief Engineer of the Bury Com-
pressor Co., Erie. Pa., and Metallur-
gical Engineer of the Detroit Steel
Products Co., Detroit, Michigan.
On account of his wide experience
in Metallurgical lines, Mr. Herron's
paper should contain some valuable
suggestions to the future engineer
who is having trouble in deciding
what to take up for his life's occu-
pation.

WORK OF COLLECTING OLD CLASS
PICTURES
During the past year members of
the Tau Beta Pi Society have been
engaged on the work of securing
photographs of the earlier graduat-
ing classes in the engineering de-
partment. This work has so far pro-
gressed that practically complete
groups of the engineers of 1865,
1869, 1870 and all classes up to and
including 1878 have been received.
Photographs copied and mounted,
and the framed pictures now hang in
the corridors of the engineering
building. A number of photos of
graduates from 1860 to '64, and '66
to '68, have been received but none
of these groups are complete as yet.
Work is now in progress and it is
hoped that within the next few
months photos may be secured of
the classes from '80 to '90 inclusive.
The members of the society would
appreciate the co-operation of alum-
ni who have class albums or gutup
pictures of the engineering grad-
uates of any year. The loan of these
pictures is requested. The time
necessary for making copies is not
very great, and in every case except
one, pictures that have already been
secured have been loaned.
In addition to the old class pic-
tures taken at the time of gradua-
tion, excellent late photographs of
large size have been secured oV *ev«
eral of Michigan's eminent engineer-
ing graduates. Such pictures now
are hung of Alfred Noble, Cornelius
Donovan, Geo. Y. Wisner, Charles
F. Brush. E. S. Wheeler, A. A.
Robinson, S. W. Robinson, J. B.
Johnson, R. C. Carpenter. Otto J.
Klotz, Benjamin Douglas, and other
eminent engineering alumni.
It is the hope of Tau Beta Pi that
this collection may be added to so
that not only all of the old class
groups may be secured, but that
many more of the great engineers
among our graduates may be given
place on the walls.
The University is becoming so
large that in no other way can the
student body come to know about
Michigan men and their achieve-
ments. This place cannot but be a
good thing for the students. They
must inevitably be filled with en-
thusiasm for their work and with
enthusiasm and love for Michigan as
they come to know of the great
achievements of the older alumni,
and of the great places they have
filled. The alumni of this depart-
ment have had their share in the
work of the world. We have many
of the master builders among our
alumni. This movement certainly
will bring the students into much
closer touch with the alumni and
their work.
AUTOMOBILE ENGINEERING
With the establishment of four
courses in Automobile Engineering,
the Engineering Department of the
University of Michigan has taken
the lead among technical schools in
the country in the development of
this latest and most widely interest-
ing branch of Mechanical Engineer-
ing. At the beginning of the pres-
ent year a group of four courses was
announced, as electives for senior
and junior students as follows:
1. Gasoline Automobiles; three
hours. A general course covering
the fundamental principles of auto-
mobile operation and design, and
their application in current automo-
bile practice.
2. Motor Design ; three hours. A
course covering the theory and de-
sign of the complete automobile
power plant.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
o. Chassis Design ; three hours. A
course covering the theory and de-
sign of the automobile chassis with
the exception of the motor.
4. Laboratory Testing Course;
two hours. This course is for ex-
perimental laboratory study of mod-
The general course and the labora-
tory testing course were given both
semesters, with a total enrollment
of 85 in the former and 26 in the lat-
ter course. Next year the two de-

ern automobile motors, with tests on
horse power developed, fuel con-
sumption, tuning, efficiency, etc.
Interest among students in both
the engineering and literary depart-
ments has been great from the start,
and outside inquiries indicate that
about a dozen will enter the Univer-
sity next year for the purpose of
specializing along automobile lines.
course, in which students will be en-
couraged to work out original prob-
lems, the solutions of which are of
immediate interest to both manufac-
turer and owner.

the country in sending motors, car-
buretors, transmissions, axles, and
even complete chasses has, in one
year, placed the Michigan laboratory
ahead of any in the country for the
study of the modern gasoline auto-
mobile. The following equipment
has already been installed:
1914 Hudson Six 54 motor and
Delco self starter.
1914 Ford Model T. motor.
1914 Reo the Fifth motor.
1911 Franklin air cooled motor.
1911 Krit motor.
1908 Franklin motor.
Complete Studebaker cut-out
show chassis.
Timken front and rear pleasure
car axles.
Timken front and rear truck axles
and transmissions.
Weston-Mott pressed steel rear
axle.
Complete Bosch magneto ignition
outfit.
Eisemann magneto and switch.
Schebler, Rayfield, Zenith carbur-
etors in cut section.
Spicer universal joint shaft.
Covert selective transmission.
Franklin multiple disc clutch.
Grant-Lees differential.
In addition to this list, the H. H.
Franklin Co. has promised a 1914
six cylinder, air cooled motor, and
the Packard Motor Car Co. has
agreed to send a complete 1914 "38"
chassis.
For its standard tests, the labora-
tory is equipped with prony brakes,
water dynamometer brakes, fuel
measuring devices, special cooling
regulating system, pyrometers, ex-
haust gas analysis apparatus. Be-
fore the end of the present semester,
a special Diehl electric cradle dyna-
mometer will be installed which will
make the laboratory testing equip-
ment as complete as any in the
country. The dynamometer, which
is the same as the well known instal-
lation at the Automobile Club of
America Laboratory in New York
City, except that it has greater flex-
ibility, will be rated at 60 horse
power and guaranteed for a speed
range of 500 to 2,400 R. P. M. With
the installation of this new equip-
ment, the department will be in posi-
tion to do testing work of much
benefit to manufacturers, inventors,
and automobile owners of the state.
Already several requests have been
received looking toward research
work, and tests have been run on
carburetors, mufflers, and a special
device for injecting steam into the
gas mixture.
In connection with the work, it is
planned to make trips to prominent
automobile factories in the middle
West, as well as to have one or
more engineers from the active field
address the sections. The first sem-
ester, the trip was made to Detroit,
where the Chalmers and Hudson
factories were inspected, followed
by an evening at the Annual De-
troit Automobile Show. Toward the
close of the semester, Mr. O E.
Hunt, '97 E., Asst. Chief Engineer
of the Packard Motor Car Co., gave
an illustrated talk on "1913 Devel-
opement" before an audience of
more than 250 students and faculty
members. His demonstration in the
laboratory, following the lecture, of
the latest Packard car was an inno-
vation which held the interest of his
hearers until well towards midnight.
The courses in Automobile En-
gineering are in charge of Asst.
Prof. W. T. Fishleigh, '02, '06 E.,
who has spent several years in the
engineering and experimental de-
partments of the Packard Motor Car
Company, of Detroit, and Mr. S. R.
Thomas, '13 E.. whose automobile
experience has been supplemented
by work covering several summers
upon two cycle marine motors.


THB MICHIGAN TECHNIC
An automatic recording gauge for
keeping continuous record of tho
stage of the Huron river has re-
cently been installed by the Civil
Engineering Department. This
gauge is located on the east bank of
the river just below the Fuller
street bridge.
The gauge is installed in a circu-
lar concrete house, the foundation of
which is excavated into a firm
gravel foundation to a depth of
about five feet below ordinary water
surface in the river. The outside
diameter of the building is six feet.
The foundation wall extends eight
feet above the ground wall. It is
substantially built, so as to with-
stand the thrust of drift and ice
jams.
The building proper which rests
upon this foundation is constructed
of colored concrete blocks which
were moulded in circular forms of
the required diameter. A conical
concrete roof covering was used.
A W. &amp; L. E. Gurley automatic
gauge which stamps the actual ele-
vation of the water surface at fifteen
minute intervals, has been installed.
The records may be taken from the
gauge when required.
The students of the hydraulic de-
partment of the University are mak-
ing gaugings of the river from the
Fuller street bridge, from which a
rating course may be computed.
With this rating course and the
gauge records, a continuance record
of the discharge of the Huron river
may be had. This method of keep-
ing discharge records is in accord-
ance with the best practice of the
U. S. geological survey. The rec-
ords of the Huron river as obtained
by the students will hereafter be
contained in the publications of the
U. S. geological survey.
TAU BETA PI ELECTIONS
The local chapter of Tau Beta Pi,
the honorary engineering fraternity,
announced recently the election of
sixteen Junior engineers and three
members of the faculty to its mem-
bership. The elections were based
upon both scholarship and personal-
ity. The following is a list of the
men who were elected, the choice
being made from the first one-eighth
in the class with reference to schol-
arship:

The initiation was held Wednes-
day evening, the 25th of March, at
which several of the faculty and stu-
dent members spoke.
A course in Scientific Shop Man-
agement is to be offered for the
first semester of 1914-15. This is a
new departure that has been con


89
templated for some time. Just how
to start, and what to do in such a
course seems to be a question that
can be answered only by starting to
do it.
As planned thus far, the work will
be entirely practical. The first step
will be to make time studies of the
regular work as now conducted in
the shop classes. The shop work
performed by the students will be
used as laboratory material. It is
intended to later plan a system by
which each piece of work assigned
to students in the regular shop
courses will be accompanied by a
complete set of written instructions
for its proper performance, and the
proper amount of time that should
be spent in performing it. After
proper inspection, each man will
then know from his instruction card,
whether his work is above or below
the average.
New features will be added as the
work develops, resulting eventually
in subdivisions and probably in more
than one course. The course must
be preceded by two courses in Shop
practice and two courses in Econo-
mics, as indicated in the forthcom-
ing engineering announcement.
The division of sanitary engineer-
ing during the year has been pre-
paring a map of the State showing
the sanitary features of each of the
principal watersheds. On this map
the drainage area of each stream is
marked out, and the maximum, min-
imum and average flow of water in
the stream is indicated. All cities
and villages having public water
supplies are shown, and the charac-
ter of their supplies,—whether from
wells, or from lakes or streams,—is
indicated by appropriate symbols.
If the water supply is taken from a
river or lake, the type of purifica-
tion plant used is also indicated.
In a similar way, the cities having
sewerage systems are represented by
another set of symbols, together
with the nature of the disposal pro-
cess, if any is employed. To this in-
formation is added data concerning
other sources of river pollution, par-
ticularly in the case of those streams
used for public water supply pur-
poses. If the sewerage is purified
before being discharged into the
stream the nature of the purification
process is indicated.
Taken as a whole, the map shows
in a clear and comprehensive man-
ner the chief features of the sanitary
situation upon each of the principal
water sheds of the state. It marks
the beginning of a thorough-going
sanitary survey of the waters of the
state which the division hopes to
push forward to completion as
vigorously as opportuntty offers.
The division of sanitary engineer-
ing is about to begin a series of
tests on the strength and other qual-
ities of sewer pipe and drain tile sold
in the state of Michigan, and of
other forms of construction used for
sewerage purposes. It is a matter
of common knowledge that vitrified
clay sewer pipe, like other clay prod-
ucts, depends for its strength and
durability upon the combination of
high class raw materials and excel-
lent methods of manufacture. Lack-
ing either of these the product is
likely to be of poor quality. There
is oftentimes a good deal of misap-
prehension on the part of city en-
gineers and other city officials as to
the relative value for sewerage pur-
poses of different materials, and also
of different shapes and details of de-
sign with the same materials. It is
the purpose of the division to make
an experimental investigation of
some of these matters and to pub-
lish the results in the form of a bul-
letin, for the use of city engineers
and other officials having to do with
sewerage and drainage problems.


9o
The apparatus for making certain of
these tests—notably the crushing
test—is now about ready for use and
it is expected that the investigation
will be carried forward vigorously
during the coming spring and sum-
mer.
The Jones &amp; &amp;Lamson Company,
of Springfield, Vermont, will shortly
place in the engineering shops one
of their flat turret lathes, for demon-
strating modern methods in lathe
work to engineering students.
This lathe, probably the most
famous of its kind, is the invention
of James Hartness, the president of
the Jones &amp; Lamson Company. It
has always been in the lead among
the highly developed modern ma-
chine tools that have made possible
the present great volume, high de-
gree of perfection, and low cost, of
machinery and mechanical appli-
ances. The Jones &amp; Lamson Com-
pany devote their entire resources to
the perfection and manufacture of
two sizes of this one machine.
To enable purchasers and users of
their lathes to secure the best re-
sults from them, they employ ex-
perts to go from shop to shop, in-
structing employers and employees
in the proper operation and use of
their lathes. One of these traveling
experts will include the engineering
shops on his circuit, appearing here
at intervals to give such instruction
and demonstrations to shop teachers
and students.
The following apparatus has been

The following new apparatus has
been added to the Mechanical Lab-
oratory this year.
A Rumely 15-30 tractor was ad-
ded in the fall. The department has
been conducting tests and are well
pleased with the results shown.
A Carbon Dioxide recorder, to be
used in stack gas analysis, was pur-
chased from the Precision Co.
Additions have also been made to
the automobile equipment. In the
last year the Studebaker Co. has
placed in the laboratory a chassis
(complete). The Hudson Motor
Car Co. has furnished one of their
six cylinder 54 horse power motors.
The Ford and Reo Co's have each
placed 4 cylinder motors of 20 and
30 horse power respectively. Sev-
eral new types of transmissions
have been added, as well as many
different accessories.


9i
The Gray Motor Co. have re-
placed their (i horse power machine
motor with a 2 cylinder 2 horse
power motor.
The students of the Mechanical
Department have petitioned the
American Society of Mechanical
Engineers to become student mem-
bers of that society.
Professor Walter T. Fishleigh,
who has charge of the automobile
courses, has been appointed a mem-
ber of the research committee of

neers. This committee will co-op-
erate with the leading automobile
manufacturers of the country in an
attempt to systematize experimental
research in automobile motors.
Professor Joseph A. Bursley is
spending a year's leave of absence
in Providence. R. I., where he is

tematic experiments is being con-
ducted to determine the effect of
the variation of the principal dimen-
sions of ships upon the resistance
to motion. A propellor dynamom-
eter is also being built and is well
on the way to completion.
The library of the Architectural
Department has had many new port-
folios and other valuable books ad-
ded to its splendid collection. Sev-
eral new casts were also secured for
the freehand drawing department at
the beginning of the year.
Quite recently an exhibition of
Beaux Art designs and sketch prob-
lems, from various ateliers and Ar-
chitectural Schools, was held in Me-
morial Hall. They were extremely
valuable for comparison of different
school methods and for the inspi-
ration of the students.
The Architectural Department is
helping to promote a state move-
ment to improve the teaching ot
drawing in the public schools. It
will be accomplished through the in-
spection of this work, the same as
is done in other branches.
All those interested in the mod-
ern illumination of drafting rooms
should visit the Architectural De-
partment. The lighting has been
tried by several methods until it
has reached the present stage of sat-
isfaction.
The Architectural Department is
carrying on extension work in De-
troit. Numerous architectural drafts-
men are taking advantage of this
atelier and are studying architec-
tural design. The Detroit architects
have requested the additional teach-
ing of architectural history and
building construction.
The wireless course as offered
here has proven more popular this
year than ever before. The whole
equipment has been overhauled and
an entire new switch board has been
put in.
For the second consecutive time.
Professor E. Lorch, of the Archi-
tectural Department, has been made
vice-president of the Association of
Collegiate Societies of Architecture.
Fourteen schools, including the large
universities of the country, were
represented at the meeting of the
organization held in New York in
January.
Professor Alexander Ziwet and L.
A. Hopkins have published a book
entitled "Analytic Geometry and
Principles of Algebra." which is in-
tended for use in freshmen classes
in Mathematics.
A series of tests were conducted
from the car in the naval tank cali-
brating the meters used in deter-
mining current flow. By means of
propellers attached to the car an ac-
curate test can be made of the meter
which in turn is used in estimating
the rate of current flow in a stream
of water.

Broad Engineering Experience
The illustration showing part of the Motor Section of the testing depart-
ment of the General Electric Company gives an idea of the breadth of experience
gained by our student engineers.
In the row of machines in the foreground are a commutating pole motor,
skeleton frame induction motor, mill type induction motor, hoist motor with
solenoid brake and totally enclosed commutating pole motor. One type of
vertical motor is shown at the right and a different type at the left. A heat
run is being made on the motor-generator set at the right.
In the four months the student spends in the Motor Section, he becomes
familiar with the operation of these different types of electrical machinery.
One or two years in the G. E. Testing Department is a valuable experience
for any electrical engineering student.

This whole group of instruments embodies the results of several years exhaustive study and
scientific Investigation of all the complex electrical and mechanical prob'ems Involved In the
development of durable, reliable, sensitive and accurate Instruments for use on alternating
current circuits.
Every detail of each of these instrument* has been most carefully studied and worked out so
as to be sure that each shall fully meet the most exacting requirements of the service for which
it is intended. Neither pains nor expense has been spared in the effort to produce instruments
having the longest possible life, the best possible scale characteristics, combined with great ac-
curacy under the most violent load fluctuations and alio under the many other trying conditions
met with in practical work. Every part of each instrument is made strictly to guage and the
design and workmanship and finish is of the highest order of excellence.
We invite the most critical examination of every detail of each member of the group. We
also solicit the fullest investigation of the many other novel features and very valu *ble operative
characteristics of these new instruments and request a careful comparison in all these respects
with any other make of instruments intended for like service. We offrr them as a valuable and
permaneat contribution to the art of electrical measurement. Their performance iu service
will be found to justify the claim that no other makes of instruments approach them in fitness
for the service required of A. C. Switchboard indicating instruments.

Very high thermal efficiency is obtained from this boiler and
setting, because:—
ist—High furnace temperature results from Dutch oven.
2nd—Gases entirely surround and closely scrub heating sur-
face from entrance to release.
3rd—The gases cannot leave the heating surface. There is
no possible chance for short-circuiting.
4th—Boiler heating surface absorbs the heat—empty pockets
in setting lose heat. There are no empty pockets in this
boiler.
.Sth—The steel-cased settings are always tight. No cracked,
warped, leaky, defective and uusightly settings exist with
this setting.
6th—A steel-cased setting is a simple and sure cure for air
infiltration losses. The largest preventable losses we have
to contend with in boiler efficiency are excess air losses.
7th—A very long pas travel—hence long contact with heating
surface is provided—hence heat absorptiou is assured.
The "WICKES" boilers are boilers that engineers and
business men are, more and more, not merely thinking about
and considering—but. Purchasing—for good and profitable
reasons!

UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN ENGINEERING SOCIETY
THE NEW STADIUM
The University of Michigan is to
have a reinforced concrete Stadium,
such as is used by the largest Univer-
sities and Colleges in the East. Its
construction is being carried out under
the supervision of the Athletic Asso-
ciation, and with the assistance of the
Engineering Department. The method
in which this building is being built
and the way in which it is being pro-
tected from exterior disturbing condi-
tions make this building extremely in-
teresting from an engineering view
point.
The Athletic Association at Mich-
igan is a self-supporting institution
depending entirely upon the profits
from athletic contests, particularly
football, for any monies that it uses
in bettering the plant. Notwithstand-
ing this condition the Association has
now a plant valued at nearly half a
million dollars for the use of the stu-
dents at the University.
Old Stands Demolished.
Several years ago the new football
field was laid out and a new set of
wood stands seating 9.000 was built
along the North side of it. The stands
from the old field were moved to the
South side of the field and up to the
past three years have been sufficiently
large to take care of the crowds at
the big games. With the increase in
interest in the game, however, it has
become necessary to increase the seat-
ing capacity. The South stands were
costing a large amount in maintenance
charges as well as occupying the only
available site where an increase in
seating capacity could be effected.
Director Bartelme and Prof. Whitney
of the Board in Control of Athletics
last year decided to make a heroic
effort to finance the building of a
stadium at Michigan. A number of
engineers and architects were re-
quested to donate sketches and esti-
mates so that the figures could be pre-
sented. The Association has just
finished paying for a club-house cost-
ing $40,000 and their credit was in
very healthy condition as a result. The
banks agreed to finance a portion of
the stands this year, and in December
the full Board in Control selected a
building committee and authorized the
building of the first unit. In January,
at the next meeting of the Board, the
plans of H. J. Weeks, ex'07, of De-
troit were accepted and he was author-
ized to place a construction organiza-
tion on the work and to supervise the
entire operation as the Engineer of
the Board.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The South Stand.
The plans adopted called for the
construction of the South leg of the
horse shoe shaped stand only. The
completed structure has a seating ca-
pacity of 47,680 permanent seats.
Temporary seats for 5,000 more can
be put up at short notice. The unit
now under construction is 396 ft. long
and 121 ft. 8 inches deep. The front
of the stands is 43 ft. from the side
lines of the football field and the first
row of seats is 4 ft. 6 inches above the
field level.
A considerable difference of opinion
developed as to the proper width of
tread, but a uniform width of 24^
inches was finally adopted. It was
soon apparent that if a wider tread
were used the only thing to be gained
was that people would not have to rise
in order to allow others to pass by.
This wide tread would be out of the
question when the riser was con-
sidered. Each successive riser was
computed by means of similar tri-
angles, assuming the line of sight of
each spectator to the near side line
to be 4 inches above the head of the
person directly in front. The result
gave a bottom riser of about 9 inches
and a top riser of about I2j4 inches,
the intermediate steps ranging between
these extreme values. In order to
simplify construction it was decided to
employ a series of tangents instead of
the theoretical curve of risers, the
changes in direction of the tangents to
be made as closely to the columns as
possible. This resulted in a very close
approximation to the curve, the clear-
ance of the lines of sight being slightly
less than four inches.
There are no entrances or exits built
above the ground. Each section of
seats occupying 30 ft. in width with a
3 ft. aisle is entered from an inclined
passage to the front of the stands.
This passage is excavated to a depth
of 5 ft. below grade. It is 16 ft. wide
and connects with a stairs 8 ft. wide
which ends directly in front of the
aisle. The stands are 55 rows high
.and the present unit calls for twelve
sections seating 1,100 each. There
are twelve main, and two end entran-
ces for this section. The seats will
all be j8 inches above the tread next
below. This is affected by using a
small concrete pedestal varying in
height inversely as the height of the
riser. To these pedestels a 2" by 10"
plank is secured. These planks are all
the full length of the section, with no
joints.
Details of Design.
Upon investigation it was found
that the sub-soil was clay, good for
3,000 lbs. The Detroit Building Code
allows as high as 8,000 lbs. for the
same material. The footing plans
were made on that basis, the dead
loads only being considered in propor-
tioning the bearing stresses. A foot-
ing 6 ft. square and 1 ft. 3 inches
thick, reinforced with l/2" Kahn Rib
bars, and tied every 12 inches with
J4" rounds, was used.
The general method of design was
that laid down by the American So-
ciety of Civil Engineers. The as-
sumed live loads were as follows:
Alain Girders and Columns.. 100 lbs.
Treads and Risers 125 lbs.
Lateral Pressure 50 lbs.
Risers assumed as semi-Tee Beams
and main girders as rectangular beams.
Mixture of concrete 1-2-4. Compres-
sive strength 2,000 lbs. in 30 days of
Summer weather, as verified by tests
of material used in actual construc-
tion. Gabriel Trussed bars were used
as reinforcement in all risers and
Kahn Trussed and Rib bars elsewhere.

In order to reduce to a minimum the
bending moments in the columns, due
to lateral forces or other causes, in a
direction parallel to the long axis of
the structure, 8 inch diaphragm
walls were used; three in each row of
columns.
Upon considering the question of
evpansion of the concrete, it was
learned that the expansion due to;
moisture was far more dangerous than
that due to temperature changes. This
was made the subject of a paper by
Prof. A. H. White (elsewhere de-
scribed in this issue) read before the
Society of Chemical Engineers. In-
vestigations covering several years
show that the expansion of concrete
due to moisture may be sixteen times
that due to temperature. This is a
recent discovery, as Prof. White fin-
ished his investigations just a few
months ago. The stadiums at Har-
vard, Syracuse, Yale, and other places
are causing considerable trouble
through cracking of the concrete; due
to temperature supposedly, but prob-
ably to moisture, on account of their
wet, low locations. It is alleged to be
a matter of but a few years until they
will be condemned unless some radi-
cal steps be taken toward obviating the
trouble from this cause.
To this end the engineers in charge
have arranged to waterproof the ex-
terior of the Michigan Stadium heav-
ily, so as to eliminate all danger from
expansion due to moisture. The ef-
fect of this water-proofing is being
watched with great interest by engi-
neers all over the country, as the re-
sults, if successful, will cause marked
changes to be made in the present
system of concrete work construction.
It has been found out that 50% of the
failures of reinforced concrete build-
ings have been due to this recently
discovered cause.
Details of Construction.
Bulk cement was used throughout
the work, and was stored in a large
bin on the premises. Storage capacity
in the bins for 2J/2 cars of each ma-
terial was provided, and the side track
gave storage for 100 cars of sand and
gravel. The use of bulk cement re-
duced the loss on this material to a
minimum. Ordinary dump wagons,
loaded with a scoop shovel, were used
to carry the cement from the cars up
the incline to the bins. These bins
were lined and covered with iron, to
prevent the weather affecting them in
any way. The material has required
300,000 ft. of lumber, 5,000 bbls. of
cement, 3,750 yds. of gravel, 2,000
yds. of sand, 150 tons of reinforcing
steel, and 3,000 yds. of excavation.
The total cost of the unit now under
construction will be $55,000.
Building Organization.
Engineer H. J. Weeks is in charge
of the construction. Prof. L. M.
Gram of the Engineering Department,
is consulting engineer on the work.
Prof. Lorch of the Architectural De-
partment, has charge of that side of
the work, while Prof. A. H. White
has been advisor on the concrete. Mr.
Week's organization handles every
branch of the work of construction
with the exception of the financial
end. Director Bartelme hopes to be
able to finance the complete stands
shortly so that the work of building
the stadium will be continuous.
With the completion of this edifice
Michigan will have attained a place in
the Football world second to none in
the West, and equal to that of any of
the Eastern Universities.


PROJECT
F. C. EMERSON, '04 E
WHEN AN engineer first takes
charge of an irrigation pro-
ject he is confronted by three
vital tho preliminary questions:
Have we the land? Have we the
water? Have we a feasible canal
line and distribution system? These
three questions correspond to the
three primary considerations in any
irrigation enterprise. There must
be a sufficient acreage of good land
lying in a position favorable for ir-
rigation, and well located with re-
spect to markets etc.; a sufficient
supply of water must be available,
either by means of direct flow or
storage in reservoirs or both; and
the location must allow for a practi-
cal system of distributing canals.
It may be in some cases, that the
first and second questions can be
passed on by the parties back of
the enterprise without the services
of an engineer, but it is seldom that
these parties would let the third
question pass without having him
make a thorough investigation. Very
often the engineer is called upon to
investigate thoroughly all three of
the matters, before the project can
be pronounced feasible. He must,
therefore, be prepared to investigate
all three when called upon.
The basis of the first question
should be apparent to anyone. Just
as a merchant must assure himself
of a market for his goods before he
actually starts his business, an irri-
gation company must assure itself
that there will be a ready market
for its reclaimed lands behore it
launches upon its project and places
its money in it. In most cases, ac-
cordingly, an engineer is called to
survey and classify all lands within
the project. The quantity and qual-
ity of the lands must, of course, be
considered, but a plentiful quantity
of good lands will not alone warrant
proceeding with the project. Their
position and character with respect
to successful irrigation, their loca-
tion as to markets and transporta-
tion lines, their altitude, all have
important bearings on the prices
they will bring. Some of these mat-
ters are more within the profession-
al province of the land-sales expert,
it is true, but irrigation companies
are often loath to go to the extra
expense of hiring such a man. For
that reason it is advisable for the
irrigation engineer to understand
them, and be prepared to give an au-
thoritative opinion on them. In
other words, the irrigation engineer
must study the business of the land
sales expert so far as it applies to
localities of the country where re-
clamation is possible or likely.
In passing on the second question,
that of water supply, the engineer
must ascertain the annual flow of
the stream on which it is proposed
to draw. As measurement of stream
flow usually requires a long period
of time, he should first ascertain if
there have been made previous rec-
ords of flow, and, if there have been
obtain them. lie will, however, us-
ually wish to establish his own gaug-
ing stations immediately upon ar-


ill
rival on the project, and for doing
this a knowledge of various methods
of stream measurement are essential.
If he finds that the direct flow of
the stream is not sufficient to fur-
nish all the water needed, investiga-
tions of reservoir sites for storage
will be called for. A practical reser-
voir site must have the three quali-
fications of an ample water supply, a
practical dam-site, and a storage ba-
sin of sufficient dimensions back of
the dam-site He must give special
attention to the foundation for a
dam, and to the materials available
for construction at or near the site.
The materials available for construc-
tion, and the accessibility of the site
will be the main factors in determin-
ing the type of clam to be consid-
ered.
The third question, that of a feas-
ible canal or distribution system, re-
solves itself, for him, into two:
What will it cost to construct the
system? When constructed, how ef-
ficiently will it perform its function
of carrying water, and what will be
the cost of maintenance? Care must
be taken in making these calcula-
tions not to carry economy to ex-
tremes for serious failures in the sys-
tem after it is in operation may re-
sult in high maintenance costs, and
losses in crops to water users He
must build with an eye to economy,
but not overlook the necessity of
safe construction.
The engineer will not usually find
it necessary to go into problems of
detailed location in this preliminary
investigation, but will find rather
that the feasibility of the work is de-
termined by a few prominent physi-
cal features of the country; such as,
certain divides that must be passed
through, over or around; certain
drainage lines that call for difficult
crossings jcertain rough stretches of
country or formations calling for ex-
pensive construction; or combina-
tions of any of these.
The solution of these three main
questions, determined by the engi-
neer's preliminary investigations,
lead directly to the two items his
employers ask for him, the estimated
cost of construction on the one hand,
and the amount and character of ir-
rigable land, on the other. The val-
ue of the preliminary investigation
should not be underestimated; the
rule in launching an irrigation pro-
ject should be "look well betore you
leap." Too often the engineer must
fight for sufficient time to make his
investigation thorough.
After the project is pronounced
feasible, and the order given to go
ahead, the engineer enters upon a
new series of labors. These may
be placed under the two heads of lo-
cation and construction, and opera-
tion and maintenance. Operation
would not come under the work of
the engineer except for its close con-
nection with maintenance, which of-
ten calls for especial skill on his
part; and, moreover, operation is al-
ways the final test of location and
construction. Thus it is important
to the engineer to understand fully
the operation of a system In fact,
it is only after one has seen a head
of water creeping through a long
system of canals and ditches, appar-
ently in search of a weak, point
and had occasion to repair failures
in this system, that he can fully re-
alise what special construction and
location is necessary to assure the
ultimate working success of a sys-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
tern. Many details that would not
otherwise be realised or impressed
upon him come through experience
in operation and maintenance.
The preliminary surveys of the
project will probably have closely
decided the lines of location of the
system as a whole. After it has been
decided to construct, the first thing
in order is usually a detailed survey
of the system. The cross-section or
construction surveys and the actual
construction work follow. In this
work of location and construction
the engineer must aim to have low
the costs, not only of initial con-
struction, but of probable mainte-
nance after the system is in opera-
tion.
In connection with location and
construction the need for a knowl-
edge of mineralogy and geology is
very important. And it is a need
that is often not appreciated. An
engineer of the writer's knowledge,
for instance, a man of broad expe-
rience in railroad construction, when
asked to classify a certain piece of
material which careful analysis
showed to contain about 7 per cent
lime, called it limestone. Asked
what limestone consisted of, he did
not know, except that it contained
lime; but what percentage of lime
was necessary in a rock before it
could be classed as limestone he
could not say. He could only tell
what it was when he saw it, without
knowing just why it was limestone;
''he was only an engineer, not a ge-
ologist."
The effect on a jury of this kind
of expression can well be imagined,
when it was easily shown by the op-
position that the rock in question
contained principally alumina and
silica, and was thus a shale, far re-
moved from limestone. It was very
important, in this case, whether the
material was the one or the other,
and parallel cases are arising con-
stantly.
This case impressed upon the
writer, also, the importance of clar-
ity and definiteness in classification
specifications for construction. Dif-
ferent prices are paid for different
materials, because the costs of exca-
vating vary. In the litigation above
referred to, the third class in
the specifications was described by
the one word "shale." Anyone fa-
miliar with shale will know that it
is found in many different forms and
conditions, so that it may be in any
one of the four classes usually
named in specifications, and often
the four classes of shale will occur
in the same cross-„section. Thor-
oughly decomposed shale is an earth,
or first class material; under the
covering of earth it will be found in
a more compact formation, excava-
ted at about the same cost as gravel
or hardpan; under this will occur a
solidified formation, excavated about
as "loose-rock" of the third class;
and finally a formation is reached
which works like "solid rock," and
should be placed in the fourth class.
In describing "shale" definitely as
only a third class material, it is read-
ily apparent that in drawing up
specifications the consideration was
lost sight of that different classes
should be so described as to con-
form to the expense of excavation.
The result of such looseness is us-
ually trouble for all parties, con-
structing company, contractor and
engineer.
Thus exactness of specifications—
and this exactness requires special


113
knowledge on the part of the engi-
neer cannot be overemphasized.
In connection with matters of litiga-
tion, w here the importance of it so
often is made manifest, it may be
well to mention also, the importance
to the engineer of some knowledge
of irrigation and contract law. This
is another thing that he must pos-
sess.
Canal location and construction
demands of the engineer a thorough
knowledge of the flow of water in
open channels, pipes, etc. He finds
plenty of use for his study in de-
sign and S. and R. in considering
wastegates, siphons, flumes, tunnels,
weirs, drops, division boxes, turn-
outs and others that occur in irri-
gation construction work.
The final test of an engineer's
work on an irrigation project is, as
previously suggested, its operation
after completion. Truly his work is
a monument to him. His errors are
ever present, and cannot be buried,
while, on the other hand, although
usually less evident, his good work
speaks for itself. More than one
small ditch in Wyoming has been
built with the grade running the
wrong way, and proved the impos-
sibility of making water run up hill
The effect on the reputation of the
engineer is obvious. Such work, of
course, is simply due to gross care-
lessness, and the writer will hasten
to say that, so far as his knowledge
extends , it is limited to the "old
timer" who may have called himself
an engineer, but was frequently not
worthy of the title of surveyor.
In maintenance work the engi-
neer must make it his business to
anticipate trouble. He must proceed
with judgment, however, for often
trouble that threatens docs not ma-
terialize. A canal system will us-
ually display several freaks after
water is turned in; it may fail at
points where trouble was least ex-
pected, or may prove strong at other
points where trouble would natural-
ly be looked for. Definite rules can-
not be laid down for all cases. While
in some cases a seepage or well de-
fined leakage, a sloughing or settle-
ment of embankment may demand
immediate action, in still other cases
the leakage may stop naturally, or
the sloughing may arrest itself with-
out any action being taken at all;
all depends on different conditions
existing in the two cases. In main-
tenance the engineer is afforded rare
chance to use his judgment in the
securing of safety on one hand, and
economical administration on the
other.
The work of operation, although it
requires the exercise of much judg-
ment in the administration of water
through the system, is mostly rout-
ine. A knowledge of the measure-
ment of water is, of course, essen-
tial. The system should be so pro-
vided with wastegates throughout
its length that the flow of water can
be well regulated from headgate to
terminus.
The foregoing is a brief and hasty
recital of some things iii an engi-
neer's part in the development of
an irrigation project as the writer
sees it after some experience. I
have endeavored to point out the im-
portant things the engineer is
called upon to do, and to call atten-
tion to certain branches of informa-
tion and knowledge, many not of a
technically engineering character at
all, which an engineer can well use,
and often must use, in practice.


ON BRASS
ASST. PROF. A. E. WHITE
In the manufacture of many brass
products it is the custom to do con-
siderable of the shaping at the atmos-
pheric temperature. Such a procedure
greatly distorts the metallic crystals
and, if carried too far, causes the lines
of cleavage to separate to such an ex-
tent that the object splits. In order to
prevent such an occurrence the prod-
uct, after it has undergone some re-
duction, the amount of reduction de-
pending upon a number of conditions
and varying in quantity from a mere
trace to 33 'A per cent, is annealed.
This is performed by heating the met-
al, even to the very center, to some
temperature between 6oo° F. and
12000 F. The method of cooling from
this temperature with compositions
containing more than 63 per cent of
copper and less than 37 per cent of
zinc is immaterial.
Condenser tubes are brass products
which, in their process of manufac-
ture, undergo a treatment similar to
that spoken of above. Tubes for this
use contain from 60 per cent to 90 per
cent of copper and from 40 per cent to
10 per cent of zinc. There are also
some tubes made from an Admiralty
formula consisting of 70 per cent of
copper, 29 per cent of zinc, and 1 per
cent of tin, and in addition there are
some tubes of special composition that
are now undergoing a more or less se-
vere service test. The most common
process employed in the manufacture
of tubes of this kind is to pour the
molten alloy from crucibles of not ov-
er 200 pounds capacity into billets and
to then cold work and cold draw these
billets, with proper annealings inter-
spersed, until a finished tube results.
For the purpose of determining the
influence of heat treatment on the
structures of a condenser tube the
writer took a tube of the following
composition and, after subjecting por-
tions of it to a number of different heat
treatments, examined the different sec-
tions under the microscope.
Chemical Composition of Condenser
Tube
Copper 66.94%
Zinc 32-95%
Lead Trace
Iron .12%
Antimony None
Arsenic Less than .02%
Bismuth Less than .02%
Ten samples were examined. These
included one "As Received"; another,
heated to ioo° C. and air cooled; a
third, heated to 2000 C. and air cooled;
a fourth, heated to 3000 C. and air
cooled: a fifth, heated to 4000 C. and
air cooled; a sixth, heated to 500° C,
and air cooled ;a seventh, heated to 6oo°
C. and air cooled;; an eighth, heated
to 7000 C. and air cooled; a ninth,
heated to 8oo° C. and air cooled; and
the last or tenth, heated to 9000 C.
and air cooled. The structures of
these respective tubes are given in the
latter portion of this article.
On heat treating these tubes it was
considered sufficient to only keep them
at the required temperature for about
fifteen minutes, for the cross section
of the tubes was so small that longer
heating was unnecessary to get the
given temperature through to the core.
The object was to determine the tem-
perature necessary to remove the
grain distortion produced by the cold


working but which would not be high
enough to cause coarse crystallization.
In this particular case it was found
that 400 C. was the correct annealing
temperature. To be sure, a lower tem-
perature would have served the same
purpose if the specimens had been
held for a longer period of time. Hud-
son and Henough, for example, found
that a Muntz metal, which is composed
of 60 per cent of copper and 40 per
cent of zinc, gave maximum ductility
when heated for seven hours at tem-
peratures between 560° C. and 690°
C. The same metal when annealed but
half an hour required a temperature
of 750° C. to bring the maximum duc-
tility. The significance of this, metal-
lographically, is that the same result—
the removal of the strain caused by
cold working—can be attained by hold-
ing the metal for a long time at a low
temperature as by holding it a shorter
time at a higher temperature.
On examining the photomicro-
graphs, we find that the one marked
"As Received" shows a rather coarse
grain with many indications of strain.
Heating to ioo° C, 2000 C„ and 300°
C. has produced no change. The 400°
C. heat treated sample, however, shows
a breaking down of the preceding type
of somewhat distorted crystalization,
which is more marked in the 5000 C.
heat treated specimen. The 6oo° C,
7000 C, and 8oo° C. specimens give
excellent proof that the size of crystals
increases as temperature increases
above temperature at which recrystali-
zation first begins to take place. The
9000 C. sample shows the character-
istic appearance of a burned tube.
All of these structures were brought
out with a special etching reagent con-
sisting of five cubic centimeters of hy-
drogen peroxide mixed with ten cubic
centimeters of water. The etching
took about twenty seconds. The pho-
tomicrographs are all magnified 75
times. The alloy has but one compon-
ent, namely, alpha (a) crystals, be-
cause the composition is such that
there is only present an alpha (a) sol-
id solution.
It is necessary that care be taken in
the temperature of annealing of brass
condenser tubes. If the temperature
is too high, or if the tube is maintain-
ed for too long a time at a temperature
which would prove satisfactory for a
brief exposure to the annealing con-
ditions, the crystals of the tube will
become coarsened and permit corrosion
to take place more readily. Further-
more, if the strains produced by the
last cold drawing are not completely
removed the tube will tend to split.
Thus a fine grained, strain free tube
should be the goal. This investigation
was prompted by the repeated splitting
of commercial condenser tubes and
since careful annealing has been in-
sisted upon there have been less fail-
ures.

ENTIAL EQUATIONS OF THE
FIRST ORDER
PROF. T. R. RUNNING
Owing to difficulty in setting up the equations in this article, fractional expon-
ents are represented by symbols as follows: 3-2 for 3/2; 5-6 for 5/6.—Editor.
If the differential equations which occur in problems of engineering
were always of the type we became familiar with in our text-books there
would be no need of graphical solutions. Unfortunately, however, many of
the equations which arise from conditions involved in problems are of a
type which cannot be solved by ordinary methods. We would not think of
solving a differential equation graphically if its analytic solution could be
readily obtained, liut when the solution cannot be obtained or is obtained
with difficulty we naturally welcome any approximate solution provided the
errors involved in such a solution fall well within the limits of allowable
errors.
It is the purpose of tbis paper to explain a graphical method applicable
to any differential equation of the first order, and which requires no more
knowledge of the calculus than the geometric meaning of derivation and an
understanding of the relation of the integral curve to its derived curve.
The following problem, involving differential equations, will serve as
an illustration and its solution will be carried out later. It was found by a
series of observations, over the particular region involved, that the limits of
water discharged into a reservoir basin during a flood could be fairly well
represented by the expression
S = 1800 /,
until a maximum was reached, after which the water discharged into the
basin could be represented by
S = 1740 — 240 t,
where .J represents acre-feet per day and t time in days. The spill-way was
40 ft. long and from the formula which expresses the quantity of water
flowing over weirs it is easily seen that the water discharged over it is
represented by 132 h3'3 acre-feet per day, where h stands for the depth of
water in feet. By the application of the method of least squares to the data
obtained by a careful survey of the region it was found that the water
surface of the reservoir could be represented to a close approximation by
. 1 = /iJ_3 + 1000 acres.
where A stands for the number of acres and h, as before, represents the
depth of water in feet. The problem is to find values of It at frequent inter-
vals up to a maximum together with the corresponding values of t.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The differential equation expressing the fluctuation of water level from
the time the flood begins to the time of maximum in flow of water is
dh _ 1800 t — 132/1'-'
dt 11 h*-* + 1000
From the time of maximum in flow to the time when the flood ceases the
fluctuation of water level is expressed by
dy _ T740 — 2jo t — 132 /13"
dx 11 /»" + 1000
The method of obtaining these equations will be explained when the solution
of the problem is taken up. For the present it is sufficient to note that these
equations do not yield to the ordinary methods of treatment.
The graphical solution of the differential equation of the first order
will be found, it is thought, quite easily carried out and the approximation
to the result very close.
Figure 1 represents the relation of a given curve to its derived curve.
The area under the derived curve
if =fCuy)
included between any two ordinates is equal to the difference between the
corresponding ordinates on the integral curve; that is to say,
Area A B C D = y, —y,
The area expressed by the left hand member of the equation is positive,


121
y2 and y\ negative, but y\ being numerically the larger makes the right hand
member positive. Also
Area E F G H = v» — y*
Expressed as integrals
f {xy) dx = y, — y, and
Area EFGH = f'f (O') dx = y, — j',.
It should be kept in mind that the slope of the integral curve, F(.vy) =o,
any point (.i'n, v°) is equal numerically to the corresponding ordinate on the
derived curve. From figure i it is seen that the slopes of the integral curve
at the points (-i',. &gt;'i)&gt; (-^^a). ), (-i"4, y4) are AC, BD, EG, and FH
respectively. These properties of the integral and derived curves are made
use of in the graphical solution of differential equations.
Since F{x,y) is the integral of f{x,y)dx it contains an arbitrary con-
stant. For every value assigned to this constant we will have a particular
curve. In figure i a value has been assigned to the constant. Clearly
F{x,y)—o will then represent an infinite number of curves. Figure 2
shows how these curves may be related to one another. We will draw lines
parallel to the .r — axis, represented on the figure by V0, yu yv V„ etc., and


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
imagine that the curves are drawn infinitely near together. Fixing our
attention upon the points where the line yu say, intersects the curves, we see

now compute the slope of each curve where it intersects the line \\ and plot
the value of this slope as ordinate to the corresponding value of .r as

abscissa we shall have a new curve which will represent the slopes of the
curves along the line y1. This curve is drawn in figure 3 and designated
by y1. Each curve in figure 3 is obtained in the manner just described and
designated by y with the same subscript as the corresponding straight line
in figure 2. The equations of these curves, which we will call auxiliary
curves, are obtained by substituting different values of y in the equation
If we now impose the condition that the integral curve shall pass through the
point (o,y0) it is evident from figure 3 that its slope at this point is oP„.

Drawing a curve, which for an approximation may be a straight line, from
the point P0 to a point Px on the curve y\ such that the area under it is
equal to yt — )'0, and keeping in mind the properties of the curves discussed
at the outset, we see that (jr^ yj will be a point on the integral curve.
Drawing a line from Px to a point P2 on the curve y2 such that the area
under it is y„—y\ another point (x2, y2) on the integral curve is obtained.
Proceeding in this way any number of points on the integral curve can be
obtained. It is to be observed that in figure 3, P0, Px, P,, P3, etc., are points
on the derived curve, and that the coordinates of points on the integral curve
are read from this figure and located in figure 2. To illustrate, Pe is a point
on the derived curve. Its obscissa a\, is equal to the abscissa of the corres-
ponding point on the integral curve, the ordinate of the point on the integral
curve is the -v designating the curve passing through h Pa. The curve desig-
nated C0 in figure 2 is the integral curve whose derived curve is determined
by the points Pw Pu Pv P3, etc., in figure 3.
We are now ready to take up the solution of the problem stated at the
beginning. Figure 4 is a rough sketch of a vertical section of the reservoir
during the flood. AB represents the spill-way, BC the bottom of the
reservoir and AC the water surface. The water flowing down the slope
CD is discharged into the reservoir at the point C, or it may be at a number
of points; h represents the depth of the water assuming that the bottom of
the reservoir is level and even with the crest of the spill-way. It is clear that
if the rate of inflow at C is greater than the rate of outflow at AB h is in-
creasing, and if the rate of inflow is less than the rate of outflow h is decreas-
ing. There must necessarily be a time when h is a maximum.
Figure 5 represents roughly the flood limits of inflow. The ordinates
on the line 5" = 1800 t represent the rate of inflow in acre-feet per day up to
a maximum. This maximum rate of inflow occurs earlier than the maximum
depth of water in the reservoir. The ordinates on the line
S = 1740— 240 /
represent the rate of inflow after the crest of the flood has passed. It is
clear that the greatest rate of inflow will occur when t=.8$3 day. By
referring to figure 4 it is seen that the rate of inflow minus the rate of out-


run miciiicas wcuxic
flow must be equal to the area of water surface multiplied by the rate of
change of li or
at
where / stands for rate of inflow, O for rate of outflow and S for water
surface. From the differential equation
dh =1 — Q

is obtained, by substituting for /, 0. and S their values given in the problem,
the differential equations which express the fluctuation of water level:

Equation (i) must be satisfied from f = o to t — .853, equation (2) from
'—-.853 to t— 7.25. As will be seen the maximum value of h occurs long
before / reaches the value 7.25.
The solution of the problem is given in figure 6. Since h = o where
t == o the first auxiliary equation will be obtained by substituting this value
for h in (1).
In the accompanying table are given the auxiliary equations with the
corresponding values of h and t.
The value .623 for h is obtained by so selecting it that the area under
the derived curve (here the dotted line) from / = o to f =-853 is equal to
h. The auxiliary curves are straight lines and are designated by the selected
values of //. The value of h will be a maximum when dh/dt — o which
occurs 4.5 days after the flood began to discharge water into the reservoir.

Jts value is 2.92 ft. More points on the integral curve can readily be
obtained. Beyond tlie point where It is a maximum dh/dt is of course
negative.
It may be well to point out again that the difference between any two
successive values of h is equal to the area under the derived curve between
the two corresponding values of /.
In finding values of h and / beyond those given in the table it must be
remembered that the area below the t axis is to be taken negative and the
derived curve will therefore cross the lines in the reverse order.


ENGINEERING
J. H. HERRON. '09 E
To every young man who thinks
he has made his decision to take a
course in engineering, this question
must invariably arise; if not before
entering college, at least before the
beginning of his second or third
year.
Perhaps , before considering this
question in detail, it may be wise to
see whether sufficient thought has
been given to the subject in general,
i.e., "am I sure that I wish to be an
engineer, or am I qualified by natu-
ral desires and tendencies to fit into
the life and give myself up to the ac-
tivities of the engineer?"
There seems to be somewhat of a
misapprehension regarding the pro-
fession of engineering, and thi0
should be corrected as far as possi-
ble. This condition of mind may be
accounted for by the tendency of
present day novelists to make of the
engineer a hero of romance. While
the true engineer loves his profes-
sion, he realizes that it is not, more
than other professions, a path of
roses.
The engineer in addition to a nat-
ural fondness for his work, must be
honest, unselfish and patient. There
are times when temptations will as-
sail him in subtle forms and he must
be honest and strong to resist.
Much of the work of the engineer
is done with little personal profit.
He frequently receives the credit for
what he has accomplished, but even
this, at times, is denied him and such
credit goes to the undeserving, there
fore he must give up these stimulat-
ing returns and content himself with
his own knowledge of a work well
done. The engineer who was the
real inventor of the so-called Cor-
liss Valve Gear, which revolution-
ized steam engineering, received
practically no profit from his inven-
tion, and it was not until later years
that he was recognized as the inven-
tor. Today, few outside the engi-
neering profession have ever heard
his name. The engineer is primar-
ily a director of men and as such
he must frequently become the buf-
fer between two opposing elements.
This will at times try his soul. These
things are all inseparable from any
branch of engineering and must be
well considered before the subject is
further entered into.
The exceeding rapid and extended
growth of accomplishment in the
field of engineering requires that the
student shall have a thorough prep-
aration in the branch of engineering
that he shall select to study, and ul-
timately must expect to closely spe-
cialize in it. It has been recognized
for some time past that in all large
work it is better to have the co-op-
eration of a number of specialized
engineers than that all shall be in
the hands of one engineer. Co-op-
eration is, without doubt, the watch-
word of the engineering future. One
eminent engineer has said that
much better results would be gotten
by several special engineers of ordi-
nary ability than by one general en-
gineer of extraordinary ability.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
In all branches of engineering,
the student must have some natural
aptitude towards the particular
branch which he desires to study. It
is not only necessary to say, "I shall
be this," for it to come to pass. Ev-
ery man, no matter in what branch
of engineering engaged, must have
the power to dream, and to bring his
dream to pass in the accomplishment
of something for the benefit of his
fellow men.
In this age of iron and steel, and
other metals, there is no more im-
portant place in the economy of en-
gineering than that fil.'ed by i&gt;*e
metallurgical engineer. It is upon
him that the responsibility rests to
take the ore that nature provides
and to fashion it into forms available
to his brother engineers for use in
the fabrication of the many ma-
chines, structures, etc., upon which
all depend. Owing to the tremen-
dous strides made in the manufac-
ture, treatment and use of metals,
notably alloy steels, in recent years,
it is felt that we are entering upon
a new era in metallurgy, and in the
future, wonderful developments in
engineering endeavor along these
lines may be looked for.
The metallurgical engineer is
more a combination of the scientist
and engineer than is usually found
in other branches of engineering. He
must devote much time to research
work, which belongs to the realm of
science, and as an engineer must be
able to take results of his research
work and make it commercially
practical.
Metallurgical engineering proper-
ly falls into two divisions.
First: That which appertains to
the manufacture of the different
metals from their ores into ingot
or other forms for ordinary use.
Second: That which governs the
selection of different metals and the
subsequent treatment to give them
for certain scientific purposes.
In the first instance the metallur-
gical engineer must watch the manu-
facture of material from the ore to
the commercial product. Upon his
skill and honesty will depend much
of the success of the design and fab-
rication of all classes of machinery,
bridges, buildings, etc. Inferior ma-
terials delivered to the fabricator
may result in subsequent failures en-
tailing loss of life and property.
The second division of this subject
is one which is comparatively new,
and will in consequence be treated
at greater length
Until a few years ago, the selec-
tion of iron, steel or other metals,
for any particular requirement was
left to the metallurgical engineer
who had made the material. As man-
ufacturing needs developed and it
was found that the metallurgical en-
gineer, in such capacity, was not the
user to any extent of the material
that he manufactured, and therefore
did not have the fullest conception
of the needs of the user, a
new branch of metallurgical engi-
neering, coming under the lat-
ter heading was found necessary.
This branch of the subject has for
its purpose the proper selection of
material and its subsequent prepara-
tion for certain engineering opera-
tions, so that now, as a rule, great
care is exercised, not only in the se-
lection of material, but in its ther-
mal treatment. Such treatment has
at times as much as doubled the
physical value of the material for
service.


129
The metallurgical engineer is, per-
haps, primarily a scientist, that is.
he must have such a knowledge ami
understanding of chemistry and
physics that he can think in them.
Unless this is possible he would be
unable to meet the problems con-
stantly arising and which he must
frequently solve without the aid of
existing literature on the subject.
The research necessary requires
that he shall have sufficient knowl-
edge to be able to understand the
phenomena resulting from his exper-
imental work. In order to properly
observe and record experimental
phenomena the metallurgical engi-
neer should have more than the or-
dinary mathematical mind and
training, since his work requires the
degree of exactness only possible to
such a mind. As an engineer he
must be able to take the results of
his experimental work and make it
a commercial success in such place
or connection where it seems desir-
able.
It was the work of Mr. Fred W.
Taylor, the well known efficiency
engineer, and Mr. Maunsel White,
metallurgical engineer, along experi-
mental lines that resulted in the dis-
covery of the so-called high speed
tool steel. The introduction of high
speed tool steel in turn has necessi-
tated the re-design of nearly all
metal working machinery. There
are now coming on the market tool
alloys, which their discoverers
claim, are as far in advance of high
speed tool steel, as high speed tool
steel was in advance of ordinary tool
steel.
Perhaps the greatest development
along this particular branch of met-
allurgical engineering has been
caused by the need of the automo-
bile industry. Here was a problem
not met with before where a high
degree of strength was necessary
with light weight. There was the
cost of up-keep of the automobile,
which included, tires, fuel, etc., and
the requirements of speed, all of
which contributed to the necessity
of reducing the weight to a mini-
mum. The metallurgical engineer
made this possible by the develop-
ment and the introduction of alloy
steels together with the necessary
greatest possible strength. As a re-
sult we now hear of comparatively
few failures, and the automobile
salesman impresses the prospective
purchaser with his familiarity with
nickel, vanadium, and chrome nickel
steels and their heat treatment.
The duties of a metallurgical en-
gineer are: to study the physical re-
quirements of a particular part of a
machine or structure or the amount
and kind of load to which it is sub-
jected; to select the material best
suited to the part and service in
question; and to decide upon the
heat treatment necessary to produce
the desired physical properties. This,
of course, will necessitate the chem-
ical examination of the material to
determine whether it is of the de-
sired composition, and the inspec-
tion and testing of the material
physically to determine whether it
possesses the desired physical prop-
erties. All of this presupposes:
a. A knowledge of the service to
which a material is to be subjected,
the extent and kind or character of
stress applied to the part in ques-
tion.
b. A knowledge of the action of
metals under different kind of
stress.
c. A sufficient knowledge of


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
chemistry to be able to determine
whether the material is of the de-
sired composition.
d. A knowledge of the effects of
thermal treatment upon the physical
properties of the material.
e. A knowledge of physical test-
ing and the necessary experience to
draw proper conclusions from such
tests.
The microscope has opened an en-
tirely new and very interesting field
in metallurgical engineering. This
particular division of the work is
designated by the term "metallo-
graphy,"and the engineer engaged in
such work is known as a metallo-
graphist. Metallography has ena-
bled the engineer to determine many
things which have heretofore been
seemingly beyond solution. By such
means it is possible to ascertain the
approximate mechanical and ther-
mal treatment to which any mate-
rial has been next previously sub-
jected, thereby enabling the metal-
lographist to learn what mistreat-
ment, if any, has been given a mate-
rial either in manufacturing, subse-
quent melting or preparation for
use. Even at times the cause of a
failure in service may be determined
and proper measures taken to pre-
vent a repetition of the same fault.
Such work has been of incalculable
benefit to the whole manufacturing
industry. With the opportunity and
prospect for its future developments,
much is to be expected from its use.
Practical work in metallography
is only possible after considerable
training on the part of the engineer
If, after considering all reasons
for and against, the student has de-
cided to become an engineer, he
must then with great care select the
particular branch for which he fee's
that he can qualify. As human
knowledge on this subject increases
there becomes less room for the in-
different one, and only to those who
are willing to give of their strength
without permitting the thought of
material gain to occupy too much of
their horizon, will success come.
As the future will be one of co-
operation the engineer must be will-
ing and anxious to work with his
fellow engineers, recognizing in
them their respective abilities.
Since the science of metallurgy is
but in its infancy, metallurgical en-
gineering opens to the student a
field possessing perhaps, a more di-
versified interest than any other
branch of engineering. Much of the
satisfactory performance of all ma-
chines, steel structure, etc., will de-
pend upon his knowledge and skill.
It in turn requires more the training
of a scientist than is usual.
The world of tomorrow may be
under the direction of the engineer.
With the increasing need of the
technically trained man at the head
of large manufacturing interests,
therew will be development along
new and diversified lines, and new
classes of engineers will result.
There may eventually be a large
class of business men educated as
engineers, in order that they may
the more readily meet the problems
confronting them as executives.
More and better iron and steel will
be necessary and without doubt
metallurgical engineers will become
the executive heads of the large iron
and steel plants. With engineers at
the helm of our large industries
there will be less danger of erring,
due to ienorance, and the world will
be a safer place in which to live.


O. W. HALL, '15 E
At the last session of the Legisla-
ture, $375,000 was appropriated for
the construction of the new Natural
Science Building for the University
of Michigan. This will give vastly
improved facilities for instruction and
research in the branches of Botany,
Forestry, Geology, Mineralogy, Zoo-
logy and Psychology—all of which
will be housed in the new structure.
Albert Kahn, of Detroit, the designer
of the Hill Auditorium, has attempt-
ed to make the new building harmon-
ize with the others on the campus, al-
though the peculiar requirements of
the new building necessitated some
radical changes from the present
scheme.
Michigan"s Diagonal Walk. As may
be seen in the accompanying first floor
plan, the problem was solved by plac-
ing the Auditorium across one cor-
ner of the building.
The size of the building is such as to
make it exceed that of the present new
Engineering Building, which has here-
tofore been the largest. The New
Science Hall, when completed, will
measure 262 feet, 8 inches on the East
side and 149 feet, 4 inches on the West
side. The North side will measure 243
feet, 6 inches, while the South side
will have a total length of 117 feet.
A space of 17 feet will separate the
building and the diagonal walk. The

General Description.
The location of the Science Hall is
to be in the space between the Law and
Chemistry Buildings across from the
Hill Auditorium. This required that
the old frame structure housing the
Homoeopathic offices and the Depart-
ment of Psychology be removed. This
removal has been carried out and the
excavation and construction of the
lower floors actively taken up. A
great deal of care and thought was
necessary to so place the building that
it would possess maximum size for
the space covered, and still not inter-
fere with the "Holy of Holies";—
lie erected, will measure 118 by 121
feet. There will be four floors in ad-
dition to the basement. In all there
will be 155,000 square feet of floor
space in the New Engineering Build-
ing.
The building proper will be con-
structed of red brick and terra cotta,
as in the Hill Auditorium. It will dif-
fer from the conventional University
building in two ways;—first, it will be
constructed on the unit system, where-
by the building is supported on a series
of uniformly spaced reinforced con-
crete piers; second, it will use every
available inch of wall space for win-

dows. In adopting these most modern
developments of Concrete Construc-
tion, the appearance of the building
will resemble to a more or less extent,
the latest factories. Reference to the
accompanying illustration will show
clearly these schemes of construction,
iy at a distance to allow of offices of
width 11 feet, 6 inches between each
pair of piers. In this way, the offices
will be of this width or multiples of it.
The partitions are to be merely curtain
walls so that alterations may be made
at any time and at little expense. The

making a building neither severe nor
fantastic, but beautiful in its simplicity.
The exterior ornamentation will be
carried out in terra cotta and tapestry
brickwork.
The foundation, as before mention-
ed, will consist of a series of rein-
forced concrete piers spaced uniform-
rooms on each side of the central hall
will measure about 23 feet in length,
leaving a passageway 10 feet four
inches in width.
The interior of the building will be
finished with plastered walls and ce-
ment floors. The halls will probably
be finished in terazzo. There will be

but very little wood used in the con-
struction of the entire building; the
oaken doors being the only instance.
The window frames will, in all like-
lihood be of steel instead of the usual
wood, to carry out the factory scheme
ning from the top to bottom. In this
way the equipment and apparatus for
each branch of science will be so cen-
tralized as to facilitate study and re-
search in the most efficient way. On
the South side, for the especial ben-
of getting the most light out of a given

Usics and Equipment.
The six departments mentioned at
the beginning will each be housed in
a separate section of the building, run-
Second Floor Plan
efit of the Botanical department, will
be built a greenhouse 30 by 60 feet.
To aid in the work of the Zoological
and Botanical departments, there will
be four constant temperature rooms
in which the temperature may be var-
ied from 28 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
These departments will have caves in
the basement for the growing and stor-
ing of plants and supplies. Some of
the caves will be devoted to the study
of the habits of underground animals,
an extremely interesting phase of sci-
ence.
The museum of the Geological and
Mineralogical departments will be lo-
cated in the building and will be open
to the general public. This will be a
great improvement over the old order
of things. The Library will be the
best equipped departmental library
on the campus, and is designed to con-
tain 30,000 volumes. These will be
housed in double tiered racks. The
Library will be lighted by the indirect
system. The air used in the building
will be filtered, thus ensuring health
and cleanliness.
The Amphitheatre will be one of the
most valuable features of the building.
It will hold about 500 and will be
equipped with the most modern acces-
sories. The lighting is by means of
indirect illumination. Special tables,
movable and stationary, supplied with
electricity, compressed air. gas and
water, and furnished with the latest
laboratory equipment for the perform-
ance of experiments of all kinds, will
be located on the platform. Motion
picture apparatus will be installed,
making Michigan the first school to
employ moving pictures in the actual
instruction of students. There are
many other new and valuable features
which the New Science Building will
possess but lack of space prevents a
detailed description here.
As the estimated cost of the com-
pleted building is about $400,000 and
the appropriation is for but $375,000,
the top floor will be left unfinished for
the time being. This will be left in
such shape that the work may be car-
ried through to completion at any time
in the future.
The New Science Building, as it is
on paper and will be in reality, will
stand as a monument to the spirit of
progress which permeates the atmos-
phere at Ann Arbor, and is but anoth-
er step toward the placing of Michi-
gan at the head of the American Uni-
versities. , i

Arch Hinged at Crown.
The expressions which represent equilibrium in an arch hinged at the
crown are, Ao1% for one-half equals —Ao1i for the other half, and
2 (z i) — 5 {Aox— Pot) 2 for each half are equal.
Here Ao1 and Po, are the distances downward, from a horizontal line
through the hinge, to the arch central line and to the proper moment polygon
respectively, Aox— Pox being equal to the intercept i. Here also z is the
horizontal distance from the center (hinge) each way to the ordinates at
the "a" points. The Ao1 ordinates are obtained by subtracting the arch
ordinates AO from the arch center height 7?, and the z distances are known
so we have only to solve to find the Po, ordinates.

find the true Pox and the true H for this doubled load, one-half of which is
our desired H for the given load.
To do this we form Table I, in Col 5 of which the loads on the right
half of the arch are combined with those on the left half giving us one-half
of a system of symmetrical loads from which we are able to figure the
bending moments due to these loads and spacings. As both sides of the
arch are loaded alike wc have only to figure the moments on one-half the
system. Also, as our arch is fixed at the abutments and hinged in the center,
so we must figure our bending moments and corresponding ordinates as in
a beam fixed at one end and free at the other. To do this we continue
Table I in which Col. 6 is the partial summations of the loads in Col. 5;
Col. 7 the spacing between these loads, taken' toward the abutment; Col. 8
the moments (Col. 7 X Col. 6) ; and Col. 9 the partial summations of these

moments made downward. (Note that in the solution of the other three
forms of arches these summations are made upwards.) As these summa-
tions are made downwards the numbers in Col. 9 are proportional to the
ordinates from a horizontal line through the hinge dmvn to the moment
polygon, not at the corresponding load points, but at the next points toward
the abutment, so that the final number corresponds to the height of the
center point above the abutment end of the polygon. As the summations in
Col. 9 correspond to bending moments, if we divide these by an assumed
H, say 100,000, we get the trial ordinates as in Col. 10. As we only need the
ordinates at the "a" points we have only figured these, and in Col. 2 have
put the proper point numbers to which they correspond.
Having our trial ordinates Po, we now form Table II which needs no
explanation. The footings of Cols. 3 and 5 give us the means of comparing
2 (Aox)2 with 2 {AoJ'o^ and arriving at the proportional error. We have
no need of finding the true ordinates Pox under this assumed double load
but, as a matter of interest, we have carried out the table, and in Cols. 8
and 9 prove that the equations of conditions are satisfied. The footing of

Col. 5 being greater than the footing of Col. 3, we see that our trial ordinates
are too large; that is, trial H is too small so we correct it accordingly and,
dividing by two, we get the true H for our given eccentric load.
With our given loads and spaces and knowing our true // we might
form an infinite number of corresponding polygons, but there is only one
which will pass through the hinge and make 2 (Ao1— Pot) z for the left
half equal 2 (Ao1— Po^ z for the right half. To find this polygon we
form Table III. This table is in two parts, corresponding to the two halves
of the arch. In the upper part we have the loads, moments and ordinates
corresponding to the combined live and dead loads on the left half, and in
the lower part the loads, moments and ordinates corresponding to the right
half of the arch. From what has gone before it will not be necessary to
explain this table out to Col. 8 except to note that the moments in Col. 6
are divided by the true H, previously found, to obtain the ordinates in Col. 8.
We must test and correct these ordinates to make 2 (Aol— Pox) z the
same for either half.
2 (Ao, — Po,) 3 Right = 2 (Ao, — Po,) z Left
2 (Aod 2 — 2 (P0l) 2 Right = 2 (Ao,) 2 — 2 (Po,) sLeft
but 2 (AoO s Right = 2 (Ao,) a Left
.-. _ 2(p0l) 3 Right — — 2 (Po,) s Left
The footings of the two parts of Col. 8 give us the means of comparing
the 5(2X Pox) moments in each half and by subtraction to find the un-
balanced moment, 121.9219.
The sum of the moments of the loaded half are too great so the trial
polygon indicated by Ax C in Fig I must be swung on the hinge to the
true position as indicated by the polygon A1X C B1X. The alterations in the
lengths of the ordinates are proportional to the intercepts in the triangles
Al £&gt;! Axx and Bt D1 B1X. These intercepts are equal to M/2 %(Z2)z where
M is the unbalanced moment.
In Col. 12 we have these intercepts which we have taken from the trial
Pox in the left half and added to the trial Pot in the right half to give the
true Poy in Col. 13. Subtracting these from the corresponding Aol we get
the true intercepts i in Col. 15. By the footings of Cols. 16 and 17 we see
that our equations of conditions are satisfied and our solution is correct.
Two Hinged Arch.
In an arch having two hinges placed at the abutments our proper
moment polygon must pass through the hinges and, as the polygon cannot
pass beyond the lines of the end reactions which pass through the hinges, it
is therefore limited by the hinges, and two polygon closing line falls on the
arch spring line.
Of the many polygons which might be drawn passing through the
hinges we must seek that one which will make 5 y i = ^(AO1 i)=o
as,
i = AO — PO
Zyi = Z[(AOy—(.AOPO)]=o
or,
2 (A0Y = 2 (AOPO)
In this equation the PO ordinates are the only unknowns. These we
determine by finding the bending moments under our given loading and then


139
ONE HINGE ARCH
with a trial H we obtain a set of trial ordinates Po which, when applied
in the formula, gives us the means of determining our ratio or error from
which we are able to obtain our correct H and therefore the true polygon
ordinates Po. As our spring line and our polygon closing line are identical,
to get the desired intercepts i we have but to subtract the arch ordinates
Ao from the corresponding true polygon ordinates PO.
If our loads were symmetrically placed on either side of the center
point of the arch we would then obtain our bending moments by forming a
moment table from the center toward one end, as the moments in both ends
are similar under a symmetrical load.

Having an eccentric load, to find the desired bending moments we may
use one of several methods. We may form a full moment table of the loads
and spaces, beginning at one end, as in table for two hinged arch marked
(first method), or in the case of a simple system of loads where the vertical
end reactions, at the abutments, are easily figured we may divide our
moment table into two parts as in the table marked (second method). Con-
sidering the first method, in the table Cols, i to 6 need no explanation. As
Col. 6 gives the bending moments down to a horizontal line Ax B through
the end of the polygon, at point B, while the true closing line would connect
the ends of the polygon, points A and B, we must then reduce these moments
by amounts proportional to the intercepts of the ordinates between these
two closing lines. Fig. 2 illustrates this condition. To do this we divide
the moment at point A — 2,785,566 by 80, the span length, and multiply by
the A' arms beginning at the opposite end of our span than that from which
our moment table was formed. This gives us Col. 8 and by subtracting
Col. 8 from Col. 6 we get Col. 9, our true bending moments. Assuming H
equal 50,000, by dividing into Col. 9, we get our trial PO in Col. 10. In
Col. 11 we have our AO and in Col. 12 their squares from which we get
~2,(AO)-. In Col. 13 we have AO X PO, the summation of which, when
divided into 2,(AO)", gives us our proportional error with which we find
our correct H and true PO, and by subtraction, PO —AO in Col. 15, which
we prove are correct by Col. 16.
The same results are obtained in the second table but with slightly less
work. Taking our end reactions as 34820 at the left abutment and 30800
at the right we find that 3770 lbs. of load 9 goes to the left abutment and
110 lbs. to the right abutment. Fractions of a pound have been neglected.
Starting at point 9 and forming our two moment tables in opposite direc-
tions we find as we should that at point 9 we have the same bending moment
in each table. (The slight difference, 34 foot lbs., is due to neglecting the
fraction of a pound in dividing load 9.) These are our true bending
moments and need no correction so from this point we proceed to find our
true ordinates and intercept as in the first method.
In using the third method we would form two moment tables starting
at the center. As the loads on one half differ from those on the other half
so our moments in the tables will differ, each set being down to its own
horizontal closing line. The difference between the final or center moments


143
in each case we would then divide by the span length to obtain a factor,
which, when multiplied by the X arms, toward and out from the center,
gives us the corrections to be added to and subtracted from the correspond-
ing moments in each half to find the true moments down to the true closing
line.
In all these problems we may either deal with and correct our trial
moments or we may convert them into ordinates first and then make the
corrections.
The student will probably profit by plotting the polygon from the trial
ordinates and then following the process graphically until it is thoroughly
understood.
Three Hinged Arch.

spaces, which will pass through the three hinges. The third hinge may be
at the center or otherwise.
Our problem is to find the ordinates, Po, of such a polygon, at the "a"
points, from which the desired intercepts i are obtained by subtracting the
corresponding arch ordinates, AO, from the calculated PO, and also to find
the true H.
To do this we find the bending moments, as in a simple beam, from our
given loads and spacings by means of a moment table, by either method
explained for the two hinged arch, remembering, however, that the middle
hinge must be included as a load point whether it has a load or not.
Having found our true bending moments we divide the moment at the
middle hinge by the height of the hinge above the spring line, which is also


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the polygon closing line. This gives us our true // at once, and by dividing
this H into the bending moments at the "a" points, where the intercepts i
are desired, we get the true PO from which we subtract the corresponding
AO to find the true desired intercepts.
H and the intercepts i are derived in the following table. The moments
in Col. 9 have been copied from Col. 9 of the table for the Two Hinge arch
(first method) as they would be derived in the same manner and it is un-
necessary to repeat the work. The moment at the hinge (Point II in this

Comparison of Results.
In the above table the figures for the Hingeless, One Hinge, Two Hinge,
and Three Hinge arches are given for purposes of comparison. Those for
the Hingeless Arch are given for the benefit of those who possess copies
of the article published in the May, 1914 issue of the Michigan Technic,
or who are sufficiently interested to desire to look it up. The whole table
gives interesting data covering the four types of arches.


The Pere Marquette Railroad ex-
tends throughout the interior counties
of the state and brings them into
touch with the outer world and the
principal markets. Without the Pere
Marquette many localities in Michi-
gan would have nowhere near their
present development. Were it to be
taken away, a serious handicap would
befall the communities now served by
it. It is, therefore, a property in
which the people of the state are pe-
culiarly interested, more so, perhaps,
than in the trunk lines passing through
the state, and doing comparatively lit-
tle local business.
The Railroad Commission of the
state are clothed with authority to au-
thorize and approve stock and bond
issues of all of the public service cor-
poration properties of the state, and it
will be necessary for this Commission
to decide upon the amount of bonds
and stocks which may be issued on the
Pere Marquette road at the time of
the coming reorganization which will
necessarily follow the sale which has
been ordered by the United States

Under the provisions of the law, the
Receivers of the road have requested

AND PRAIRIE LANDS
ALLEN T. DUSENBURY. '04E
Situated in the delta of the Mis-
sissippi River in the southern por-
tion of Louisiana is a body of allu-
vial land containing approximately
ten million acres. Of this about
seven million acres is timbered, but
now partly denuded, the balance be-
ing open prairie covered only with
dense growths of varied prairie
grasses.
Small portions of this ten million
acre tract are high enough for nat-
ural drainage, but the great ma-
jority of it lies only six inches to two
feet above mean Gulf level, so that
it must depend for its agricultural
value upon artificial drainage. This
extensive body of land occupies
space which was once part of the
Gulf of Mexico, a fact well estab-
lished by geologists, and was formed
by the deposition of silt brought
down by the "Father of Waters"
from the twenty-six States which
comprise the great valley of the
Mississippi. This formation is of
very great depth, it sometimes being
necessary to drill over three thou-
sand feet before sand or rock are
encountered. The exceeding rich-
ness of this Delta land is apparent
from the fact that the soil which
washes off the farms in the upper
valley in times of heavy rains and
floods is the choicest top soil, and
thus the cream from all the farms
in the Mississippi Valley has been
transported to Louisiana to form
this delta. A delta country is rich
accordingly as the valley through
which the river flows which forms it,
and as the valley of the Mississippi
is conceded to be the most fertile
valley on the face of the earth, this
portion of Louisiana can not be less
rich than the famed deltas of the
Rhine and the river Nile.
In spite of the amazing fertility of
this land, only a very small quanti-
ty of it has as yet been put to agri-
cultural use, this portion consisting
of strips ranging from one-quarter
of a mile to one mile in width bor-
dering on the Mississippi River, the
Bayous Lafourche and Teche, and
a few smaller streams which were
once affluents of the Mississippi
Although for many years past quite
a number of the plantations front-
ing on these streams have used ar-
tificial means to aid in their drain-
age, it has only been a few years
since the reclamation of the prairie
drainage was depended upon entire-
ly. But now enough of this land
has been thoroughly reclaimed and
put in a high state of cultivation, by
farmers from the North and West,
to prove the entire feasibility of the
undertaking, and at present
there are many men and corpora-
tions engaged in the work of chang-
ing these age-long haunts of the ali-
gator and muskrat, and breeding
places of mosquitoes into beautiful
and highly productive farms.
The reclamation of this delta land
is an exceedingly simple proposition
from an engineering standpoint.
First a topographical survey is made
and the boundaries of a tract to be
included in a Reclamation Unit are


147
determined. Then a dredge boat is
passed around the tract, the spoil
from the canal dug by the dredge
being thrown to the inside, thus for-
ming a continuous levee which is
built up till it is high enough to pro-
tect the land within from any out-
side overflow. Then a system of ca-
nals is dug within the leveed area,
the canals serving the purpose of
sumps or reservoirs into which the
small surface ditches empty, and at
the same time conducting the water
to a pumping station.
This pumping station is located at
a point which is best fitted for the
needs of the particular tract and
should have a sufficient capacity for
removing a run off of one and one-
half inches in twenty-four hours.
The reservoir canals should also
have a storage capacity of at least
one inch of rainfall over the whole
area, and when there is added to
this the amount of water which will
be temporarily absorbed by the land
itself, it is only an exceedingly
heavy rain which will not be readily
taken care of.
The first unit reclaimed by the
company with which the writer is
associated, and which company is
the pioneer in the Reclamation of
the Wet Prairie Lands of Louisiana,
contained about one thousand acres,
but larger areas were afterwards
treated, and now we have adopted
five thousand acres as a unit bes*
adapted for the work. Topographical
conditions, however, will oftentimes
make larger or smaller areas neces-
sary. As it will be many years be-
fore an adequate railway system tra-
verses the marshes of South Louis-
iana, and as this territory is already
a net work of canals, bayous and
lakes, water transportation must
largely be depended upon, but when
properly understood and utilized it
is the cheapest method of transpor-
tation. The canal which surrounds
each reclaimed tract is made a navi-
gation canal, usually forty feet wide
and eight feet deep, and this is made
to connect with the general system
of waterways so that each farmer,
after no more than one mile haul by
wagon, can place his produce on
boats or barges and transport it to
the sea, to the city of New Orleans
or to some other desired shipping
points.
Various types of pumping ma-
chinery have been used in this rec
lamation work. Paddle wheels,
sometimes having as great a diame-
ter as forty feet with paddles eight
feet wide and making from three to
five revolutions per minute have
been used to some extent, as well as
a crude type of vertical submerged
centrifugal pump, but now the best
practice requires horizontal centrifu-
gal pumps designed for very low
lifts, the larger sized pumps being
direct connected to Corliss engines,
the pumps and engines being usual
ly mounted in duplicate on a con-
crete dam which is constructed
across the main reservoir canal at it?
junction with an outfall canal or the
bayou or lake on which the tr^ct
may border.
The total average rainfall in
Southern Louisiana is about sixty
inches per year, but as evaporation
here is nearly equal to total rain-
fall, and as the growing crops would
more than take up the balance if our
rains were equitably distributed
throughout the year, it might be


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
thought we would never need to
start the pumps. However, this
is not the case, our heaviest rains
coming during the summer months,
at which time most of the pumping
takes place. Yet the pumps will sel-
dom need to run more than thirty
full days out of the whole year.
The reclamation of these lands
has now arrived at the stage where
experimental work is practically
over and the costs fairly well estab-
lished. In units of approximately
five thousand acres, the total cost of
reclamation, including levees, reser-
voirs, surface ditches, roads and
pumping station should not exceed
twenty-five dollars per acre. The
cost of pumping based on conditions
prevailing during the past few years
should not exceed forty cents per
acre per year, and this in compari-
son with costs of irrigation in most
of the Western districts is almost
negligible.
Louisiana is a magnificent State.
It has wonderful natural resources
including oil, gas, sulphur, salt, tim-
ber, oysters and a great many other
varieties of sea food. Its oranges
and grape fruit are unequalled and
a great variety of other fruits flour-
ish. If one must endure the climate
of any one section of the country the
year round, I know of no place
equaling southern Louisiana, and,
with the exceeding fertility of its
soil, when this portion of the Slate
is fully developed, as it will he in a
very few years, I believe it is des-
tined to become the garden spot of
the whole United States.


PROF. GEORGE W. PATTERSON
THERE are two very different ways of considering the action of the
transformer, that of the physicist and that of the electrical engineer.
These ways are confusing to the student of electrical engineering be-
cause the expression "self induction" is used by both, but in different mean-
ings. The object of this short paper is to make the facts clear in the hope
that some one may be helped. Let us first take the physicist's view. The
electromotive force produced in the secondary of a transformer is said to be
due to changes in primary current acting by mutual induction on the sec-
ondary winding. The formula for this action is
e\ = — M du/dt, (i)
where M is the mutual inductance, i, the primary current and t the time.
Part of the secondary e. m. f. is lost because of resistance r2 and self
inductance 1, of the secondary winding, so that the terminal e. m. f. of the
secondary is
e~. — — M du/dt —h du/dt —r,i,. (2)
The electrical engineer does not accept formula(i), which states symbolically
that the e. m. f. generated in the secondary is greater as it is greater. The
engineer believes the contrary to be true, for to him electromotive force is
produced by rate of change of flux, and he would write equations (1) and
(2) in a different form, viz.,
e% = — N, dtt/dt (1')
e, = — N, d&lt;t&gt;^dt — r,u (2')
where N, is the number of turns in the secondry winding and (f&gt;.2 the flux
linking with them. It will be noticed that the physicist considers that a
larger secondary e. m. f. is produced and then part lost in secondary self
inductance, while the engineer does not consider that this lost part was ever
produced. Evidently we have the relation,
e", = — N, d&lt;P-Jdt = — M du/dt — /, dijdt.
As primary and secondary currents in general are opposed, the last term is
arithmetically a difference. The e. m. f. applied to the primary is expressed
by the physicist (eddy currents in the core being ignored) as follows:
c, = r, u+ /, dijdt + M dijdt, (3)
and by the electrical engineer
^m.+ ATi dfr/dt, (3')
where the symbols have the same meaning as before, i. e., \1 indicates primary
circuit, etc.


We know that there is some leakage of flux so that fa and fa differ.
The equation may be written in another form
ei - r, ii+ AT, d&lt;t&gt;-./dt + AT, d(&lt;t&gt;,— &lt;t&gt;,)/dt. (3")
The leakage flux fa — fa produces the same effect in the primary e. m f. as
would be produced by an equal flux linking with an inductive winding of the
same number of turns in series with the primary, which, from the physicist's
stand point might be represented by
Z,, dil/dt = N1 — &lt;h)/dt],
where is only part of lr
The electrical engineer then writes the formula for primary applied
e. m. f.
&lt;r, — r, t, + Li du/dl + AT, d&lt;t&gt;t/dt, (3"')
and he calls Lx the self inductance of the primary circuit.
This formula may be expressed as a vector equation if e„ i1 and fa are
simple harmonic, as follows:
E: = r, /,+ / L,« /,+ j *,
when Ej, Ij and *2 are maximum values and 01 an angular velocity. It is
usual to assume Kx and Ii as effective values and fa as maximum value. In
this case we must write the formula
E, — r, 1, f L,w 7,-f; AT,« "K/v'2; (4)
and for the secondary terminal e. m. f.
Ei = — j AWV2 — rj.. (5)
These equations make no reference to self inductance in the secondary and
ignore all except that part of what the physicist calls the selfinductance of
the primary which is involved in leakage flux.
To say that either the physicist or the engineer is in error is a mistake.
They are both right, but they do not agree in their definition of the term self
inductance.
To take into account the effects of hysteresis and eddy currents in the
core would require a much more complicated treatment of the subject. For
this the reader is referred to the writings of Dr. Steinmetz and the other
masters of the science.


DON A. SMITH. '15 E
The new Argo plant of the Eastern
Michigan Edison Company recently
put into operation in Ann Arbor, is
unique among electrical plants and of
considerable interest to an engineer,
for it combines the functions of a gen-
erating plant, a distributing station,
the old Argo dam, and a power house
having a rated generating capacity of
900 K. W. and a total D. U. R. capac-
ity of 1450 K. W. A 14 foot head of
water acts upon the turbines, which
are of a type designed by Professor
Zowski for the Allis-Chalmers' Com-
it
Argo Dam Power House
and a railway feeder station, and in-
cludes what is probably the only water
driven direct current generator in the
country running parallel with a motor
generator and feeding directly into a
railroad trolley system.
The Argo plant consists of a con-
crete dam about 200 feet long, built
over and including in its construction
pany of Milwaukee. Eour high ten-
sion lines of the Eastern Michigan Ed-
ison Company, two from Detroit via
Geddes, one from the Barton plant
and one from Detroit by way of Whit-
more Lake and South Lyons, feed into
the plant, making it a switching sta-
tion in the 23.000 volt circuit compris-
ing the Washtenaw: Division.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Generating Station.
As a generating station the Argo
plant consists of two units of 450 K.
W. capacity each, direct connected to
hydraulic turbines, of 575 B. H. P.,
one unit generating alternating current
at 2300 volts, the other direct current
at 650 volts. In each unit the genera-
tor rests on the main floor and the tur-
bines are placed 14 feet below the ro-
approximating .8 and is controlled en-
tirely from the switchboard.
Motor Generators.
In addition to the turbine generators
and the governor there are on the main
floor a 35 K. W. exciter, driven by a
2300 volt A. C. motor, and two motor
generators of 500 K. W. capacity for
changing A. C. current to D. C. cur-
Argo Dam
tor and three feet above the level of
the tail face. The weight of an entire
rotating part of a unit is carried by a
thrust bearing in the generator frame
above the rotor. In addition to the
thrust bearing there are three steady
bearings, one above the rotor, one in
the main floor and one above the tur-
bine. The governor is placed between
the A. C. and D. C. generators and
may be attached to either, although as
a rule the A. C. generator runs with-
out a governor at a fixed gate opening
rent for railroad power. Motor gen-
erators were installed in the Argo plant
instead of rotary converters as in the
other railroad sub-stations, to increase
the power factor on the transmission
system. By over exciting the field on
the synchronous motors the power fac-
tor can be kept at about 85 or 90 which
is considered very good on account of
the large induction motors in use in
Ann Arbor at some distance from the
station. Without the motor generat-
ors on the line the power factor in the
station runs at about 70.


153
Distribution Station.
The load at the Argo plant for Ann
Arbor light and power averages 700 or
800 K. W., with a maximum in win-
ter of 1200 K. W. At nearly all pe-
riods, therefore, current must be taken
from one or all of the four high ten-
sion lines coming in from other power
houses. This current is stepped down
from 23,000 volts to 2300 volts by
three water cooled syphon system
transformers of 1,000 K. W. capacity
switches are located on a raised plat-
form above the switch board as are al-
so four automatic voltage regulators,
two of 300 K. V. A. and two of 500
K. V. A. capacity. Six feeders carry
three phase 60 cycle current out of the
plant for commercial and power use
in Ann Arbor.
Railroad Sub-Station.
As already stated the Argo plant is
unique among railroad generating
plants because Of the operation of the
Interior View
which are located in a separate room
at the north end of the building. In
this room are also high tension oil
switches, and on a raised platform the
23,000 volt, four tank aluminum cell,
lightning arrestors for the high tension
lines entering the building.
The current for local purposes is
taken off the switch busbar, which may
be switched in with the A. C. generat-
or and any or all of the feeders com-
ing into the plant. The 2300 volt

lel with the motor generator, and the
linking of the two with the trolley and
rail of the Detroit Jackson and Chica-
go Railroad at Ann Arbor. The Edi-
son Company's engineers were divided
as to the advisability of putting in this
D. C. generator and there was some
speculation as to its successful opera-
tion. The D. C. Generator is govern-
ed by the automatic opening and clos-
ing of the gates controlling the water

entering the wheel and it necessarily
meets the changing load due to car
movements less quickly than the syn-
chronous motor driven generators. It
was therefore impossible to tell exactly
how the two would run in parallel.
In the short time, however, that the
plant has been in operation it has been
found that the D. C. generator runs in
parallel with a motor generator, even
better than the two motor generators
ries it entirely and the motor generator
sends A. C. current back into the line.
It is surprising how well the motor
generator runs from the D. C. end and
generates A. C. Current in the Syncho-
nous motor. This will work out very
well at times of high water when the
water driven machine can be run con-
stantly at about full load.
The plant was designed by, and con-
structed under the superivision of

governor opens and closes the gates
to meet changing loads on the D. C.
Generator, so quickly as to cause con-
siderable erosion of the banks of the
pond above the plant. When operating
the water driven generator and the
motor generator in parallel, the load on
the water driven machine varies but
little (400 to 600 amp.) and the motor
generator takes the fluctuating load
(o to 1500 amp.) keeping the voltage
on the line constant. When the load
is light the water driven machine car-

FRESHMEN TAKE NOTICE!
Foreword from the Asst. Dean.
Students entering the Engineering
Department often fail because they do
not realize the size of their job. Some
are poorly prepared in Mathematics
and Language; others are well pre-
pared but not serious-minded and wil-
ling to work to the limit. Engineer-
ing education today, contrasted with
the training required twenty years
ago. is like an automobile compared
with the "one-boss shay." To master
engineering theories and modern prac-
tice in four years a student must make
a flying start and keep up the pace
with body and mind every day of his
course. Every lesson must be learned
and every task performed on schedule
time or discouragement and defeat
await the delinquent student. The
studies of the course are so closely
related and interdependent that abso-
lute continuity is necessary. There
is no time for an engineer to sow wild
oats or revel in social distractions. He
is from the first engaged in mastering


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
a difficult science and in securing a
profession on which his future de-
pends. The intense rivalry among
engineers calls for the severest train-
ing and the greatest industry from the
day of admission. If lessons in fresh-
man mathematics and language are
neglected and only half learned, fail-
ure in subsequent technical studies is
certain. The worst failures come to
students who enter with no fixed pur-
pose and who "know it all" when they
come to us. An earnest desire to
master the engineering science and a
willingness to work under competent
instruction will bring success even to
a student poorly prepared. Forget
that you were the brightest boy in
Podunk High School and realize the
fact that you are entering deep waters
in which you must rely on skilled
pilots, if you wish success in College!
With good health, regular hours,
and honest effort you will get value
received for your expenditure of time
and money, so that your day of gradu-
ation will mark the culmination of a
great and successful struggle for mas-
tery and the beginning of a brilliant
professional career.
It is with great gratification that we
take our pen, or rather typewriter in
hand, and begin the publication of this
second issue of the present volume.
Even though the last issue was too
late to get around among all of the
students of the University, still it
reached some of them; none of them
has thrown anything as yet, so we take
it as a good omen. Some of the letters
which were received after the ap-
pearance of the first issue were ex-
tremely encouraging, coming as they
did, from old grads who had been
through the same troubles that we are
now going through in printing the
Technic. In any event, it was a start
and that counts for a great deal. With
everybody pushing with us and stand-
ing back of us, we will put the Mich-
igan Technic in the place it deserves
among University publications.
We stand in the same place as a man
driving an automobile some years ago
in the West. In coming around a bend
on a grade he ran into a frightfully
steep hill, covered with gravel. In
stopping to let a team pass he found
himself unable to start again, although
he had been going all right previous to
his stop for the team. Just at that
time, however, a cowboy on horseback
came along, and , seeing the trouble,
hitched his lariat about the front axle,
looped the other end about the horn of
his saddle and spoke to his pony. With
the engine of the car running and
the mighty tug that the pony gave
in his first lunge, the car started and
kept going without further aid. That's
it! We can keep going after we gel
a good start, but throw us your lariat
and give us a Kft! Then stick around
ready to keep boosting.
Engineering Society.
The new plan for the organization
of the Engineering Society was left
out of the last issue through unavoid-
able circumstances. Briefly, the plan
is to subdivide the former one society
into a number of branch societies, each
branch to represent its department.
Thus there will be branches of the Me-
chanicals, Chemicals, Electricals, Civ-
ils, Navals, etc., each of which is a
separate society in itself. Each soci-
ety will have its own treasury, officers,
organization, meetings, etc., but will be
represented in the general society by
its presiding officer. The general so-
ciety will consist of the membership of
all of the branches and will be govern-
ed by a committee composed of the


157
heads of the branch societies. One of
these heads will be elected to be Pres-
ident of the General society, and, as
such, will be able to govern the gener-
al society according to the ideas ex-
pressed in the sub-societies and trans-
mitted by the sub-society heads.
In this way, the difficulty of getting
all of the society members interested
in one subject foreign to their line
of interest will be avoided, and each
branch will hold meetings of interest
to the members alone. Of course, the
meetings of any one branch will be
open to any or all of the members of
the other branches who may be in-
terested in that particular line of work.
This plan was evolved only after a
rigid investigation of all possible plans,
taken, into consideration both this
school and others. The Engineering
society was a success in former days
when the school was small and the in-
terest concentrated. But the Society
failed to grow with the school, and as
a consequence, has lost out. It is be-
lieved that this plan will be a success,
and the earnest cooperation and assist-
ance of all the students, both old and
new, is desired.
The War.
It is a very significant fact in the
war abroad that Engineering is taking
by far the greatest part in the warfare.
Leaving out of consideration for the
moment the frightful carnage and loss
that is going on; a matter to be deep-
ly regretted but which cannot be help-
ed, it is interesting to see how modern
science has applied recent inventions
in the carrying on of the war. Air
ships, both dirigibles and aeroplanes,
have played a very valuable part in
locating the weakest part of an oppos-
so that the attack might be made to
the best advantage. Aeroplanes, flying
high at dusk have rendered invalu-
able service in collecting data for maps,
etc. It is almost impossible to hit them
with cannon, flying high and swift, so
that they usually get what they want.
They also are deadly when it comes
to dropping bombs and explosives in
desired localities.
Automobiles have evinced their pop-
ularity by the manner in which they
have been confiscated and pressed in-
to actual'service of war. The generals
of the opposing armies with their
staffs use machines constantly in di-
recting the battles, and messages are
handled almost entirely by their aid.
In a recent newspaper photograph, it
was very noticeable that an American
machine was being used as a carriage
for small cannon by one of the armies.
Sad as the war is, it is of interest to
see how modern inventions are playing
their parts.
Thanks!
The Technic board wishes to
thank all of the contributors and mem-
bers of the staff for their help and co-
operation in getting together this and
the preceding issue. Without their as-
sistance it would be a hard row to
plow, and we assure them of our ap-
preciation.
Our Advertisers.
The advertisers who make this pa-
per possible to a large extent, are not
in the business for pleasure any more
than we engineers. They are adver-
tising for results, and when they don't
get them they feel that there is no
further use in advertising in the same
place. We request that they be given
careful consideration by all of our
readers, as their wares are standards
in their respective lines of work.


RESEARCH WORK
A series of tests have been conducted in
the Mechanical Laboratories by B. H.
Stuck and C. J. Taylor, both of the 1914
Engineering class, to determine the co-
efficient of air friction in galvanized iron
pipes for varying velocities and pipe sizes.
Very little accurate data is to be found on
this subject and practically no experimental
data has been determined.
The pipe used was ordinary galvanized
pipe such as is used for ventilating ducts.
The longitudinal seams were interlock
joints, and transverse connections, 2" slip
joints. All points were painted and taped
to minimize leakage. The air was delivered
by a No. 4 Sirocco Blower driven by a
D. C. shunt motor.
It was decided that the Pitot tube was
the best means of measuring air velocity
pressure and static pressure and the tube
manufactured by the American Blower
Company was accordingly adopted as the
best fitted. The tests were conducted on a
duct about 100 feet long in which three
stations were marked off for readings, 40
ft. apart, and at least 10 ft. from any varia-
tion in shape of the pipe. In order to ob-
tain the average velocities in the pipe, ten
readings were taken, in vertical and hori-
zontal planes. This was necessary because
of varying velocity between the centre and
outside air currents.
In order to read low velocities and static
pressures manometers of unusual accuracy
had to be provided. These were especially
designed for this work and were made in
the engineering shops. They were cali-
brated by means of the hook guage to give
magnified readings of pressures to one two-
thousandth of an inch, measured vertically
on the liquid used in the manometer tube.
From the Continuity equation, the aver-
age velocity of air at all cross sections of
the pipe must be equal; hence all head lost
in friction is lost from the static pressure
head. By measuring the static pressure at
each of the three stations, this loss
was obtained over two separate lengths of
pipe; then, by involving this value expres-
sed in feet of the air flowing, with the
length (/.). perimeter (/&gt;), and area (A)
of the pipe to which it applies, and the
velocity of the air (F), according to the
equation
A. = fLPvt/A2g
the coefficient (/) was determined.
The tests were conducted on 6" pipe, and
tended to show an increased coefficient at
decreased air velocities, rising very rapidly
at velocities below 1500 ft. per min. At
higher velocities the values were more
nearly constant—at least up to 4500 ft. per
min., which was the maximum speed at-
tained in the tests.
Gas Fkixowship Work.
The Michigan Gas Association has for 14
years maintained one or more fellowships
in Gas Engineering at the University of
Michigan and have also supported an ex-
periment station at the works of the Ann
Arbor Gas Company. One of the perplex-
ing problems in gas manufacturing has
been to free gas completely from finely sus-
pended tar particles. Two years ago work
on this was commenced at the experiment
station and an attempt was made to apply
high tension electric currents to the. depo-
sitions of these fine particles. The work
carried on by Mr. R. B. Rowley, *I2E and
F. W. Steere, '12E, has shown it was en-
tirely possible to completely purify gas by
this process. Work has been continued at
the gas experiment station along the same
lines during the present year and it has
been shown that it is entirely feasible to
purify illuminating gas from suspended
particles at the rate of 25,000 feet an hour
with the expenditure of only .2 K W in
power. The results of this investigation
were presented at the meeting of the Mich-
igan Gas Association in September in a
paper presented jointly by Professor White
and R. B. Rowley and C. K. Wirth.
Mr. F. W. Steere has during the last year
developed the process along somewhat dif-


159
ferent lines at the coke ovens of the Somet-
Solvay Co. in Detroit. He has met with
success in the application of the process to
coke oven gas and also to the purification
of producer gas. All of the gas used in the
gas engine that runs the Ford Automobile
plant in Detroit has for the last six months
been purified by the Steere process. The
apparatus has worked entirely satisfacorily
and the process has a bright future. Mr.
Steere is to present a paper describing his
process at the meeting of the American
Gas Institute in October.
INVESTIGATIONS BY PROFESSOR
ZOWSKI.
Considerable discussion was brought
about by the appearance of the Rees Ro-
turbo Pumps of English design that were
recently introduced into America by the
Manistee Iron Works Company. Two of
these pumps were bought last year for
Campus fire protection. It was claimed
that the "drooping power curve" which
makes the overloading of the motor im-
possible, was obtainable only by the un-
usual form of the impeller of these pumps,
this impeller being patented in all coun-
tries.
Investigations, however, were started last
year in our laboratory and are as yet un-
finished. They were made on a special
pump designed by Professor Zowski and
built for laboratory purposes and in this
pump six impellers were tried. One ques-
tion which in recent years has been very
much discussed by engineers, both here and
abroad, was whether it is possible to obtain
the so-called "dropping power curve" with
pumps of ordinary proportions by only giv-
ing the impeller vanes proper curvatures
and angles. Professor Zowski's experi-
ments have shown that the same condi-
tions as hold in the Rees pumps are ob-
tainable with ordinary forms of impellers
if only the impeller vanes are designed
properly.
Professor Benjamin Bailey of the electri-
cal engineering faculty has been working
on a new line of electric automobile start-
ers, embodying his own patents, for the
American Electric Starter Company, of De-
troit, of which company he is chief engi-
neer.
NEW FACULTY MEMBERS
Mr. J. A. Van den Broek. who has been
appointed to the position in Engineering
Mechanics made vacant by the resignation
of Mr. Eadd, is a Hollander by birth. His
early educational training was obtained in
the high school of Middelharnis, his native
city; and later, for a brief period, in a
school in Germany. He came to this coun-
try in 1905, attracted by the democratic in-
stitutions and ideals of the American
people. In the early summer of 1907 he
went to Lawrence, where he settled down
for a course in the civil engineering de-
partment of the University of Kansas.
The summer of 1911, following his grad-
uation, was spent in the wilds of Van-
couver and British Columbia, on a rail-
road survey, and the following winter in
the office of Hedrick and Cochrane, a lead-
ing engineering firm in Kansas City en-
gaged in large reinforced concrete con-
struction. A visit to Holland occupied the
following spring, during which time a posi-
tion in the government engineering service
in Dutch East Indies was offered him. He
preferred America, however, and presently
returned to this country, taking first a po-
sition with the Boston Bridge Company,
and later a place in the bridge department
of the Canadian Pacific Railway, at Mon-
treal, which he now leaves to come to the
University.
Mr. Van den Broek is highly regarded
by those with whom he has been asso-
ciated, and has made many friends. His
interests have not been bounded by his
day's work, but have extended especially
to music and art and out door life. His
chief recreations arc tramping and canoe-
ing, the latter sport especially being fol-
lowed with enthusiasm.
The electrical engineering department
staff will be strengthened next year by the
coming of Mr. T. J. MacKavanagh, to be


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Assistant Professor of Electrical Engi-
neering. Professor MacKavanagh has been
head of the Electrical Department of the
Shawcnegan Technical Institute for the
last two years, during which time he has
also conducted special investigations on
electrical machinery and insulators, for the
Shawenegan Falls Power Co., Canada.
Previous to 1912, Professor 'MacKavanagh
taught electrical engineering at the Nova
Scotia Technical College, Halifax, Nova
Scotia, coincideiitly serving as Chief Elec-
trician of the cable ship Minia engaged in
locating faults in cables under the Atlantic
Ocean, and repairing them.
Professor MacKavanagh received his
university education in Glasgow, Scotland.
He is an expert in telegraphy and wireless,
and has been engaged in many and various
lines of engineering work, both electrical
and mechanical. He is an enthusiastic and
expert teacher, and his conscientious ser-
vice will increase the power and efficiency
of our electrical engineering department.
MICHIGAN MEN IN THE
PRESS*
The annual meeting of the American
Society for Testing Materials held at At-
lantic City in July was attended by Profes-
sors White and Ware of the Chemical
Engineering Department. Professor White
presented a paper on "Volume Changes in
Portland Cement and Concrete" which was
a continuation of the results presented be-
fore the same society three years before.
He also attended a meeting of the commit-
tee on coal sampling and analyses. Pro-
fessor Ware presented a paper on the
examination of "Chinese Wood Oil." This
oil has of recent years come into promi-
nence as a varnish oil. It is in some ways
much superior to linseed oil for varnish
making and had it not been for its introduc-
tion the price of varnish must have in-
creased much during the last few years.
* This list is not by any means complete.
It is almost impossible to obtain data of all
the articles published or written by Mich-
igan Men, so that any information regard-
ing same is earnestly solicited.
Up to the present time there has been no
satisfactory methods for analyzing this oil
and determining whether it was adulterated.
Professor Ware and Mr. C. L. Schumann
in this paper present a simple and very
satisfactory scheme of analysis. Professor
Ware also attended the session of the com-
mittee on preservative coatings. Summaries
of the papers follow.
VOLUME CHANGES IN PORTLAND
CEMENT AND CONCRETE.
By A. H. White.
Portland-cement structures retain their
colloidal property of expanding when wet-
ted and contracting when dried, even after
20 years' exposure to the weather, and after
baking to 6oo° F. A bar of neat cement
may be made to progressively expand or
contract according to the choice of moisture
conditions. It may be made by successive
bakings to contract as much as 4.6 per cent.
Cement bars containing sand do not con-
tract readily on account of the interlocking
of the aggregates. When such bars are
dried they become more porous and, there-
fore, on immersion, more water can enter,
so that new particles of cement clinker
will be hydrated, with a still further result-
ant elongation of the bar. Bars of 1.3 sand
mortar have by successive bakings and boil-
ings been made to elongate 0.75 per cent.
Bars cut from sidewalks taken up after 20
years' service have been made to elongate
0.175 per cent by successive immersions in
water at room temperature. This elonga-
tion is as much as would be calculated for
a rise in temperature of 3000 F. It must
be considered a grave source of danger to
concrete highways in wet locations. Dense
concrete, even when wet, does not contain
any liquid water and does not suffer any
expansion on freezing. Such concrete when
measured while frozen will be found to
have contracted at the same rate as cast
iron. Porous concrete containing liquid
water expands on freezing and does not
return to its original length on thawing be-
cause of the wedging of the aggregates.
Repeated freezings will thus cause progres-
sive distintegration.

EXAMINATION OF CHINESE
WOOD OIL.
By E. E. Ware and C. L. Schumann.
Ths paper deals with the development of
two methods for the quantitative estima-
tion of the adulteration of Chinese wood
oil.
The principle upon which the first method
is founded is the formation, in wood oil,
of an isomeric glyceride that is insoluble in
light petroleum ether. This reaction or-
dinarily takes place very slowly even in
bright sunlight, but it may be accelerated
by the addition of any one of a number of
materials in small quantity. The precipi-
tate may be filtered out, and the residue
weighed after freeing from petroleum ether.
This residue consists of the adulterant and
the unaffected glyceride of the wood oil.
The weight of the unaffected glyceride may
be taken as 7 per cent of the weight of
wood oil present.
The second method depends upon the
insolubility in alcohol of the potassium
soap of elaeomargaric acid. The precipi-
tate may be filtered out and weighed, after
drying in a non-oxidizing atmosphere.
The two methods show a degree of ac-
curacy much better than the existing meth-
ods, and permit a fairly rapid estimation of
the purity of samples of wood oil.
STRENGTH OF LIME MORTAR.
By W. E. Emucy, '06E and S. E. Young.
In this paper is described an attempt to
measure the compressive, tensile, shearing,
and transverse strengths of lime mortar,
and to ascertain how these values are af-
fected by the numerous variables met with
in practice, such as: chemical composition
of the lime; kind and amount of sand; size
and shape of test specimen; conditions un-
der which the test specimen is stored; the
effect of added materials, etc.
The results indicate that the strength
developed by a specimen of lime mortar is
affected by too many variables to be cap-
able of accurate measurement in the labora-
tory, and that even if this were possible,
there is no assurance that the results ob-
tained would be comparable with those
which might be expected in practice.
In the "Horseless Age" of date Aug. 19th
appeared an article entitled "The Proper
Angle for Venturi Tubes," written by a
member of the faculty in the School of
Auto Engineering. Mr. S. R. Thomas. He
takes up the problem from an analytical
point of view and discusses a series of ex-
periments bearing on the subject. The ar-
ticle is well illustrated by photographs.
At the December meeting of the Society
of Naval Architects to be held in New
York City, Professor Herbert C. Sadler
will present a paper on "The Expansion
and Contraction of Ships Forms and the
Effect upon Resistance." The paper will
embody the results of investigations carried
on in the naval tank for the past year and
a half.
CHANGES IN COURSES AND
FACULTY
The courses in Chemistry required of all
engineering students have been materially
modified during the past year. The course
in Qualitative Analysis has been made op-
tional for all except the Chemical Engi-
neers and the course 2E in General Chem-
istry has been increased from a four to a
five hour course. The students will thus
obtain in their freshmen year a more de-
tailed study of chemical reactions and will
be relieved of the work in the sophomore
year. As an offset to the decreased amount
of time given in Chemistry, course 1 in
Chemical Engineering has been increased
from a two to a three hour course to cover
the general study of the chemistry of build-
ing materials. These changes will go into
effect immediately and it is hoped will
result in a more satisfactory balance of
work in the engineering courses.

Currents, has been considered by the fac-
ulty and the change will probably sooner
or later be adopted.
At present, Course II, which begins the
study of Electrical Engineering, is devoted
entirely to Direct Currents and Course III,
following it, to Alternating Currents. The
two subjects, however, are so nearly related
as to make impractical the consideration of
one without the other. To bring these to-
gether, it is proposed to make Course II
similar to Electrical Engineering I, as re-
quired by all Engineers except Civils and
Electricals, and cover both Direct and
Alternating Current Machinery. Course
III would then be a more advanced treat-
ment of the same.
The Electrical Engineering department
will continue this year the practice inaugu-
rated so successfully in the second semester
of last year, of offering some practical
courses in electrical work open for election
by sophomores only. These courses are
under the direction of Professor Higbie,
who conceived them, and they promise to
increase very greatly the interest of the
students and the effectiveness and practical
value of their efforts. Two courses are
offered, as follows:
E. E. la—Practical Management of Elec-
trical Machinery.
E. E. lb—Electrical Construction.
The courses cover laboratory work only,
and are in no sense theoretical. It is in-
tended that they should precede the work
in electrical physics and accompany the
work in mathematics, to give the student
some basis of practical experience for his
work in electrical measurements and cal-
culations, to sustain and develop his in-
terest and enthusiasm for electrical work
during the tedious and discouraging ex-
perience of acquiring the fundamental
mathematics and other preparatory know-
ledge, and to familiarize him with the con-
struction and manipulation of the equip-
ment used in his profession, before he
enters the technical courses of the Junior
and Senior year. In this way he works at
higher efficiency and speed during the first
two years than he otherwise would, and will
be enabled to get much more of value out
of his junior and senior year than formerly.
The plan seems to be working as conceived
as far as we are able to judge at present.
About half of the electrical engineering
sophomores elected these courses the first
semester they were offered.
ENGINEERING MECHANICS.
Professor G. W. Patterson, Professor of
Electrical Engineering has been detailed by
the Dean to have charge of the Department
of Engineering Mechanics for the year
1914-1915. Lack of funds has prevented the
Regents from obtaining a new outside man
big enough to fill the position and it was
necessary for Professor Decker, who
headed the department last year, to resume
the teaching of Civil Engineering Courses.
Professor Patterson will devote a large
share of his time to the endeavor to make
the Engineering Mechanics courses satis-
factory to faculty and students alike.
A new text-book, "Maurer's Technical
Mechanics," is being used this semester in
Engineering Mechanics I and will be used,
commencing next semester, in E. M. Ill
as well. This text, written by the Profes-
sor of Mechanics at Wisconsin, has been
off the press only six months, yet has al-
ready been adopted by many engineering
schols in the United States. In the opinion
of the Mechanics faculty here, it is the
best text-book on the subject yet written
and is supplying a long felt need.
DRAWING.
Descriptive Geometry or Drawing 4 has
for this year's Freshmen an entirely dif-
ferent aspect to what it has presented to
former '"Yearlings," as the subject matter
has been divided into two parts. A two
hour course given the First Semester cov-
ers over half of the point, line and plane
propositions. A second two hour course in
the Second Semester finishes these and
treats the development and intersections of
surfaces.
In each of these courses, the work con-
sists of two lectures of one hour each and

one drawing period of three hours. For
the drawing periods the Freshman Class is
divided into twenty sections, and the lec-
tures are given to two sections at a time
in Room 411. This room has been re-
modeled and re-arranged and belongs to the
Drawing Department, except for the im-
memorial M. E. I. lecture on Wednesdays
at eleven o'clock. The Descriptive Geom-
etry Lectures are given by Professor Gould-
in, Assistant Professor Finch and Mr.
Taughe, who explain and demonstrate the
propositions by means of models. The
taking of notes is obviated by having the
lecture follow close to the order of the
textJbook, so that the student may devote
all his attention to the lecture. Some quiz-
zing is done in lectures and some during
the three hour drawing period, much of the
mechanical drawing and plate making for-
merly in the course having been omitted.
One hour a week of outside work is utilized
in the solving of assigned problems.
The alteration is expected to make De-
scriptive Geometry a fair amount of work
for four hours credit. It has been found
in the past that students were neglecting
other work to ensure a passing grade in
Drawing 4, rather than chance having to
put in the required thirteen hours a week a
second time. Under the new arrangement,
a student failing to pass in either two hour
course will have only half the work to go
over again. The net result of the change
will be the accomplishment of three things:
the teaching of Descriptive Geometry in a
way more profitable and more attractive to
the student, a reduction in the percentage
of failures, and a material lessening of the
consequences of a failure in the old Draw-
ing 4.
The Frce-Hand Drawing Courses are
this year being given directly under the
control of the Architectural Department.
These courses, from Drawing 21 on, are
required of Architects and have always
been modeled more or less according to the
ideas and requirements of the Architectural
Department. The Instructor in charge of
the courses, Mr. Everett, who has been a
member of the Engineering Department
Staff, has been transferred to the Archi-
tectural Department and the courses, while
open to Engineers, will be primarily Archi-
tectural.
SHOP.
To fit in with the change made in De-
scriptive Geometry, Shop I has been divided
into two two hour courses, the one Wood
Shop, the other Forge Shop. The student
will hereafter carry one the first semester
and the other the second semester, instead
of both together as formerly. It is expected
that the carrying of this work throughout
the year will improve the physical dexterity
of the Freshmen more than the crowding
of it all into one semester.
ARCHITECTURE.
The following changes have been recom-
mended in the Department of Architecture:
Courses I, II, III and the Special course
are hereafter to be known as Programs I,
II, II and IV, respectively, in Architecture.
Four months experience will be required
in the first three programs instead of the
present requirement of one summer's ex-
perience for programs I and III, and two
summers for program II. (Four hours
credit.) The present summer school re-
quirement for programs I and III will be
discontinued.
Architecture 2, a new two hour course in
architectural drawing, shall be required of
all Architectural students.
The credit of a number of Architectural
courses will be changed as follows:
Architecture 4 from 2 to 3 hours.
Architecture 5 and 6 from 3 to 4 hours.
Architecture 7 and 8 from 4 to 5 hours
respectively, to 6 hours.
Architecture 9 from 5 to 8 hours.
Architecture 22 from 2 to 3 hours.
Architecture 5a 5b, 6a and 6b shall each
carry 2 hours credit.
Architecture 23 and 26, each 4 hours, will
be given as 2 hour courses.
A 2 hour course in English will be re-
quired in Programs I. II and III, in place
of English ia.

more year and the other two hours the

applies particularly to Civils, whose sched-
ules have been arranged accordingly. More-
over, Chemical Engineers will not have to
take the two hour course, which treats
differential equations.
NEW LATHE IN THE ENGINEERING
SHOPS.
The Harkness Flat Turret Lathe, loaned
to the Engineering Shops by Jones and
Lamson, Springfield, Vt., is now in place
ami ready for use. This lathe, which costs
around three thousand dollars, represents
the life work of one man, James Harkness,
and contains twenty-two patented features.
As a machine tool it represents the highest
degree of perfection yet attained and has
brought into existance what might well be
called a new profession. Machinists who
have become expert in the turning out of
work with this lathe are no longer plain
"machinists" but "J. &amp; L. Operators" and
as such are much in demand.
The new lathe was obtained through the
efforts of Michigan Alumni with the Pack-
ard Automobile Company, a large user of
J. &amp; L. lathes, and credit is due them for
showing true Alumni spirit. It will be
used principally for demonstration pur-
poses in connection with Machine Shop
Courses, and more especially in the new
Scientific Shop Management Course offered
for the first time this semester.
IMPROVEMENTS IN AUTO-
MOBILE LABORATORY
The new Diehl Dynamometer for auto-
mobile testing has been installed in the
Mechanical Laboratory. It is of the design
and equipment of the dynamometer in use
in the New York Automobile Club and in
Detroit Automobile factories and has a
speed range of 500 R. P. M. to 2500 R. P.
M. and a capacity of 90 H. P.
In connection with the dynamometer, a
special water cooling apparatus was de-
signed in the Laboratory here and also a
fan blower which gives an air draft cor-
responding to actual road conditions. There
has also been installed an outfit designed to
run as a motor for starting gas engines
under test and for measuring friction horse-
power or horse-power consumption for any
units at different speeds. A scries of tracks
has been laid out so that later a chassis may
be backed in and complete tests run on a
car by attaching silent chains to car wheels
and drums on the dynamometer.
Course M. E. 33 in advanced automobile
engineering is being offered this semester
to students who have had M. E. 29 and 32.
This course has been established for the

The Wickes Vertical Water-Tube Boiler
Very high thermal efficiency is obtained from this boiler and
setting, because:—
ibt—High furnace temperature results from Dutch oven.
2nd—Gases entirely surround and closely scrub heating sur-
face from entrance to release.
3rd—The gases cannot leave the heating surface. There is
no possible chance for short-circuiting.
4th—Boiler heating surface absorbs the heat—empty pockets
in setting lose heat. There are no empty pockets in this
boiler.
5th—The steel-cased settings are always tight. No cracked,
warped, leaky, defective and unsightly settings exist with
this setting.
6th—A steel-cased setting is a simple and sure cure for air
infiltration losses. The largest preventable losses we have
to contend with in boiler efficiency are excess air losses.
7th—A very long gas travel—hence long contact with heating
surface is provided—hence heat absorption is assured.
The "WICKES" boilers are boilers that engineers and
business men are, more and more, not merely thinking about
and considering—but, Purchasing—for good and profitable
reasons!

. 4 Marines averaged 144 hours
8 Architects averaged .... 146.9 hours
Only eighteen out of a total of one hun-
dred seventy-eight graduates had 140 hours,
the minimum required number. Fourteen
had 141 hours, twenty-one had 142 hours,
while twenty-four men. half of whom were
Civils, averaged 158.2 hours. The average
for all the seniors was 145.58 hours.
For many years, about fifty per cent of
the students of the Engineering Department
came through with clear records each se-
mester. A decided increase, however, set
in three years ago and has continued, reach-
ing its maximum last semester when sixty
per cent of all the Engineers had neither
conditions or flunks.
Advocates of the Mentor Group System
can probably see in this increase the ful-
fillment of their expectations and the justi-
fication of the system as a necessary part
of the department. We may also assume,
however, that we have had a better class
of students and better teaching- Both
these things may have had their effect but
the consensus of opinion is that the bring-
ing of the student into intimate contact with
at least one member of the faculty, enab-
ling him to keep tab on this work through-
out the semester and to receive warnings
and friendly advice, has been the pre-
dominating factor in increasing the effi-
ciency of the department.
In excavating for the foundations of the
new Science Building, it was necessary to
tear up a section of the concrete tunnel
which housed the electric light cables and
steam pipes supplying the Hill Auditorium.
This tunnel, high enough for a tall man to
walk through upright and as wide, with
walls nine inches thick, was situated on the
line of the west foundations of the new
building, and will not be rebuilt in its pre-
vious form. Instead, the pipes and cables
will be carried through the basement of the
Science liuilding, the Auditorium Tunnel
serving that building with heat and elec-
tricity and the Science Building basement
serving as a section of the Auditorium tun-
nel.
Electricity for the Hill Auditorium and
the new Science Building will be brought
from the power plant at 2300 volts to a
point near the Southwest corner of the
Science Building. A pit is to be sunk there
and transformers installed which will step
down the current to 230 volts. This, in
the course of time, will effect a considerable
saving of current.
SUMMER SCHOOL BASEBALL CHAM-
PIONSHIP WON BY ENGINEERS.
The championship of the 1914 Summer
Session League was annexed by the team
representing the engineering department.
This team, under the guidance of "Tommy"
Hughitt, won seven out of their nine games.
Hughitt, Sisler, Stewart and Eaton, with
Buck Wheat as pitcher, were the engineers
picked for the all-campus team which de-
feated the city Independents 5-1, on Ann
Arbor's "Big Day." In this game Hughitt
secured a homer and three singles out of
four times at bat, while Stewart chalked
up a round trip, a double and a single out
of a like number of trips to the plate.

THE NEW ENGINEERING SOCIETY
The last two issues of the Michi-
gan Technic have referred to the
New Engineering Society at different
times, without giving any definite rea-
sons for calling it the "new" Engi-
neering Society. Up to the present
time, matters have not stood so that
a complete detailed description could
be given. It is the purpose of this
short article to attempt to clearly show
just what the Engineering Society is
today, what it stands for, and what
advantages may accrue from member-
ship in the organization.
In order to partially explain the
causes for the reorganization, it may
be well to go back into the earlier his-
tory of the Society. It was founded
primarily to meet the needs of the stu-
dents in the Engineering Department
for a general meeting place, and the
privileges of a reading and studying
room. Lectures were also arranged
for their benefit, being given by prom-
inent men of the outside world. Lat-
er on, the Society took onto itself the
responsibility of publishing a maga-
zine, the Michigan Technic This
was founded in 1886, a few years af-
ter the founding of the Society. For
a number of years the Society and
Technic enjoyed success, as the de-
partment was not so large as to dwarf
the possibilities and advantages of
such an organization and combination.
Papers were given by student mem-
bers, and issued in the form of trans-
actions, and later on in the Michigan
Technic It is an interesting fact
that a number of the papers written
by the early graduates of the Univer-
sity of Michigan, and printed for the
first time in the Michigan Technic,
were later in great demand on account
of their value to the engineering
world. Some of them were reprinted
on account of the great demand for
the articles.
Matters progressed in a successful
way until, for some unknown reason,
interest seemed to fall off in the So-
ciety, and, naturally, in the Michigan
Technic For some years, things
dragged on thus, with no apparent di-
rect cause for the falling off in the
interest, so essential to the proper
maintenance of the functions of the
Engineering Society. As is well known
to the graduates of the past few years,
the Engineering Society and the
Technic have had hard sledding to
make their way, and have been at
times, dormant. Occasionally an ex-
ceptionally energetic board would get
into charge, and things would boom
for a short time, only to die out with
the passing in of a new and less active
board.
Matters finally reached the stage
where something definite and positive
had to be done, and done with dis-
patch. A committee was appointed to
investigate the reasons for the success
of similar organizations in other insti-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
tutions, and to report on a scheme
suited to the proper reorganization of
the Society. This committee took the
better part of a year in this work of
investigation. It communicated with
societies in other schools; consulted
with prominent faculty members,
many of whom had had an active part
in the work of the early Society; and,
most important of all, made a careful
study of the conditions existing in the
Engineering Department. As a result
of these thorough investigations, a
new plan was drawn up by the com-
mittee, approved by the faculty, and
ratified by the Engineering Society.
Pla.v or Organization.
The basis of this plan was laid upon
the uniting of the interests of the sep-
arate Engineering groups into one
general society, providing at the same
time means for maintaining the inter-
est in each of the Engineering groups.
It was found that, in the first place,
the Engineering Department had
grown so much faster than had the
Society that it had lost track of it.
and, in the second place, the Engineer-
ing groups had been segregated to
such an extent 'that intercommunica-
tion was almost futile. None of the
Civils took Mechanical courses, the
Marines and the Chemicals never saw
each Other, the Electricals were herd-
ed off in a corner of the basement by
themselves, and, as a consequence,
general meetings of the Society had
nothing in common for any more than
one group, to which that particular
meeting might furnish interest.
Accordingly, steps were taken to or-
ganize sub-societies in each group,
with the result that, today, there are
four branches: the Student branch of
the American Institute of Electrical
Engineers; the Student branch of the
American Society of Mechanical En-
gineers; the local branch of Chemical
Engineers; and the local branch of
Civil Engineers. Owing to the fact
that there are no student branches in
the National Chemical and Civil En-
gineering Societies, the branches
formed are strictly local. There is
very live possibility of the organiza-
tion of a student branch of the So-
ciety of Automobile Engineers in the
near future.
The next step was to unite the sep-
arate interests of these sub-societies
into a General Society, which was to
represent the school. Accordingly the
head officers of each of the sub-socie-
ties formed a board of control at the
head of the General Society, and one
of the members of the board of con-
trol was elected Chairman. In this
way the interests of each of the sub-
societies could be closely kept in touch
with, by means of the head officer of
the sub-society, and the policies of the
General Society were but a combina-
tion of those of the sub-societies, as
expressed through their head officers.
Each society, of course, had its sep-
arate organization with its officers,
time of meetings, programs, etc., so
that it was, in reality, a complete so-
ciety in itself.
Membership.
The membership in the societies was
arranged as follows. In the branches
of the National Societies, the regular
dues of the National organization
were paid to the proper officer of that
society, and in addition a certain sum
was paid into the treasury for main-
taining the General Society, the So-
ciety rooms and the Michigan Tech-
nic, subscriptions to which were in-
cluded in this sum. In the other
branches the dues were set by the so-
ciety itself, with the regulation that a
certain sum, as before, be paid over to
the General Society. As some of the


177
branches could not include Freshmen
in their membership, a special arrange-
ment was made whereby they could
be admitted to the roll of the General
Society by payment of one dollar, and
had, then, the privilege of attending
the meeting of the particular society
in which they were interested, without
actually being active members.
Results.
The outcome of the reorganization
has not been capable of accurate meas-
urement as yet, on account of the de-
lay and difficulty connected in getting
the old order of things broken up, and
the slowness in getting the new or-
ganization under way. Several things
have already indicated that the new
plan is a satisfactory one, however, as
there is being shown an interest in the
Society never taken before within the
memory of the oldest P-G student in
the Department. The present mem-
bers are showing great interest, and
are planning active campaigns to in-
crease the membership of the sub-so-
cieties, and the General Society.


OF THE EVOLUTION AND THE
HISTORY OF THE INTERNAL
COMBUSTION ENGINE
A. F. GREINER
The internal combustion engine is now in the 6th decade of its develop-
ment. During this time constructive engineering and scientific research
have increased the economy and output of this, our oldest heat engine, to a
truly wonderful degree, both in the improvement of the materials of con-
struction and in the understanding of the working cycle. The fuel consump-
tion per B. H. P. hr. has been decreased from 106 cu. ft. of illuminating
gas to 14 cu. ft., the thermal efficiency has increased proportionally from
4% to approximately 30% and the specific capacity has been increased ten-
fold. This is the case not only when operating with coal-gas proper, but
all combustible gases, irrespective of impurities or of heat value, are now
capable of economical use as fuel for internal combustion engines. Where
such gases are not available as the main- or by-product of the industry, the
gas can be produced from solid fuel in the same economical manner in
which it is used in the engine.
So out of the original small motors highly satisfactory prime movers
were developed for the large industries, which even now are built in
500 H. P. units, and are distributed all over the world in more than 800,000
installations and with a combined output exclusive of automobile engines
of much over eight million H. P. (Refer. Bulletin 55 Bureau of Alines 1913.)
The old competition between gas and steam power still goes on, en-
livened continually by the increasing successes of the internal combustion
engine. Over-zealous followers of Otto and Diesel now as in i860 prophesy
a rapidly approaching end for the great creation of James Watt.
After its rapid development, the internal combustion engine has at-
tained and energetically maintained its purpose—the supply of power to
the industries. At this time, a critical review of the different phases of its
evolution and history will furnish the internal combustion engine designer
with valuable information. For him, the unsuccessful experiments and
projects of others will serve as salutary instruction. They will show him
the ways and means by which the capacity and economy of the engine were
increased step by step, and they point out the direction in which he may
expect further development.
In order to make such a practical application possible, the history of the
engine should however not be drawn entirely from patent specifications and
general publications concerning successful engines. It must deal thoroughly
with the manufacture and operation of the engines and should include not
only the final results but should also take into consideration everything-done
from its first conception in the mind of the inventor to the final successful
test. For the proverb, "Problcren geht iiber studieren," (Experiment is
more valuable than study) is especially true for the gas engine designer.


179
Numerous inventions—among them some whose claims of success had
been proven by computations carried to the fifth decimal place,—failed
completely on the testing block. Sometimes the results obtained were such
that the original ideas of the inventor could hardly be recognized. For
instance, Otto started out with the four-cycle compression engine; he
digressed to the atmospheric engine, and after fifteen years he resumed
work on his four-cycle engine which is even today the most successful type.
Diesel intended to build an isothermal combustion coal-dust engine. What
he arrived at was an oil engine with a three-fold increase in temperature
during1 combustion. On the other hand practical experiments often ob-
tain successful results even if the fundamental theory would indicate the
very opposite. For instance, does not the injection of water into the
cylinder, as it was done in the Banki engine, appear doubtlessly uneconomi-
cal from a thermodynamical stand point? And yet Prof. Banki obtained
by this simple means a very remarkable reduction in fuel consumption.
It is a rule in such cases where the results really obtained are so far
removed from those originally desired, that during the experimental period
a great deal of research and constructive work is wasted, which often has,
or at least should have an instructive influence on others. But usually, his-
tory has nothing to say about this preparatory and inventive work, for the
independently creating designer makes a secret of his unfinished and unsuc-
cessful attempts, unless unusual causes like patent suits, etc., force him to
make them public. So it happens that tedious and expensive experiments,
the impracticability of which has long since been established, arc continually
repeated by others, causing an unnecessary waste of many- thousands of
dollars.
Such experiments are a fruitless work which even a perfect history of
the internal combustion engine could not completely do away with. The
following review of the most important working cycles and forms of
development of this heat engine will at least show in outline what has
already been done in this great field. Its history falls into two periods.
I. Period of invention and speculation.
II. Period of development and application.
I. PERIOD OF INVENTION AND SPECULATION. (1678-1860.)
Vacuum Gun-Powder Pump.
iiautefeuiu.e, 1678.
Through the explosion of gun-powder in a closed chamber provided
with valves and the subsequent cooling of the gases of combustion, a vacuum
is created which is used for the drawing of water.
Vacuum Gun-Powder Engine,
huyghens, 1680.
By the creation of a vacuum in the same manner as I Iautefcuille, how-
ever, carried on in an engine cylinder, the atmospheric pressure is used for
the operation of a piston.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Directly Working Gun-Powder Pump,
hautefeuille, 1682.
The pressure resulting from the explosion of gun-powder is used for
lifting a water column.
Vacuum Gun-Powder Engine.
PAPIN, 1688.
Contractive work and practical tests according to the ideas advanced by
1 lu yghens.
Gas Turbine,
john barber, 1791.
Gases produced from solid or liquid fuels and mixed in a special cham-
ber with air and a little water are ignited and the resulting impulse is to be
utilized for the operation of a turbine wheel.
Oil Engine,
robert street, 1794.
Liquid fuel is evaporated in a cylinder and mixed with air taken in
during the first half of the stroke. The mixture then is ignited by a con-
tinuously burning ignition flame at the middle of the stroke and the piston
is driven outward by the gases.
Double Acting Illuminating-Gas Engine,
lebon, 1801.
Gas and air are pumped into a mixing receiver, are then taken over
into the double acting working cylinder and electrically ignited.
Vacuum Illuminating-Gas Engine,
samuel brown, 1823.
In a working cylinder provided with a water jacket a vacuum is created
by relieving the combustion pressure of the remaining gases by cooling, so
that the atmospheric pressure can be used as a driving means. (Practically
applied.)
Double Acting Explosion Engine,
wellmann wright, 1833.
Engine with two charging pumps and a centrifugal, quality regulating
governor. Working cylinders are water jacketed. Ignition occurs at the
dead center by means of an ignition (lame. (Practically applied.)
Explosion Engine with Compression,
william barnett, 1838.
Gases and air are separately subjected to compression by the charging
pumps and after being mixed in the cylinder are further compressed. Igni-
tion occurs at the dead point by means of a glowing sponge of platinum or
by a flame valve.


Condensation Gas Engine,
james johnson, 184i.
The piston is driven outward by the explosion of a hydrogen-oxygen
mixture. A vacuum is created under the piston by the condensation of the
steam produced.
Hot Tube Gas Engine,
drake, 1842.
Illuminating gas engine with a plunger piston, suction during the first
half stroke. Quality regulation by a centrifugal governor. The cast-iron
hot tube is heated by compressed gases and the ignition channel is laid bare
by the piston at the middle of the stroke. Later petroleum was used. Prac-
tically applied. Engine exhibited in Philadelphia in 1847, had an output of
20 H. P. at 103 lbs./in2 explosion pressure and a M. E. P. of 38 lbs./in2 and
a speed of 60 R. P. M.
Hydrogen Gas Engine,
christian reithmann, 1852.
A mixture of air and hydrogen is compressed by means of a special
pump to a pressure of 2 to 8 atmospheres, electrically ignited and the com-
bustion gases are expanded in a cylinder. (Practically applied, was in
operation in Munich until 1858 and then remodeled for illuminating gas.)
Atmospheric Free Piston Engine,
barsanti and matteucci, 1854.
The explosion pressure of an electrically ignited gas mixture drives a
free piston upward in a high vertical cylinder. In this way very complete
expansion occurs and through the cooling of the gases a vacuum is created
under the piston. The piston driven down by the atmospheric pressure
operates the crankshaft by means of a rack and pinion. A second flat piston
moved by this shaft controls the inlet and outlet channels of the compression
chamber and draws in the fresh mixture. (Built in 1857 by John Cocherill
in Seraing.)
Gas Engine with Compression,
degrand, 1858.
It is proposed to compress the mixture in the working cylinder itself
instead of in special charging pumps as heretofore.

Lenoir.
Early in i860, almost 50 years after the opening of the first public Gas
works, the french mechanic Lenoir arrived at a satisfactory way of using
■coal gas for power purposes. Lenoir constructed the first serviceable gas
•engine not as a far sighted inventor or a creative designer, but by means of a
path cleared by others. His engine was the product of a skillful combina-
tion of well known details, the careful study of the most favorable working
conditions and the fortunate overcoming of practical difficulties. The
originality of the Lenoir engine was not held very highly even by the manu-
facturers themselves. In a paper published by M. Lefevre of Paris, in 1864,
was stated, ''The Lenoir engine uses the piston according to the patent of
Robert Street, it is direct and double acting as Lebon's engine, it is electrically
ignited as that of von Rivaz, it can be operated by hydrogen as proposed by
Herskine-Hazard, .and probably we would recognize Talbot's splendid ideas
in the slide valve as used by Lenoir. But the Lenoir engine draws in gas and
air itself without previous mixing—the latter is always dangerous and re-
quires special pumps—and that constitutes his patent claims." This new
motive power was rapidly heralded to the world by overbold and possibly
unscrupulous advertising.
The original experimental period was evidently very short. Only eight
months after procuring the French patents (Jan. 24, i860) a 1 II. P.
Lenoir engine was in public use in a Paris machine shop. Lenoir's original
engine had a bore of 3" and a 5" stroke. It was without a waterjackct, was
however double acting and was electrically ignited. A continuously spark-
ing ignition plug located in the wall at the middle of the cylinder was laid
bare by the piston at the middle of its stroke and in this way ignited the
mixture in the front and back end alternately. A plain slide-valve operated
by an eccentric was located on the side of the cylinder and provided for inlet
and outlet. The following two experimental engines were larger and were
provided with a water jacket for cooling the cylinders and cylinder heads.
Still like the first engine they did not show any original ideas and were
modeled after the current steam engine types.
The individual construction and arrangement of the Lenoir engine
began only when its manufacture wras licensed to capable firms. The con-
struction which showed the most skilful work and served as model for many
later engines was that of Marinoni, a machine manufacturer of Paris. In
Germany the firm of G. Kuhn of Stuttgart, built a small experimental engine
in 1861 according to the working drawings of Marinoni. The tests of this
engine gave unsatisfactory results and for this reason the manufacture was
discontinued. Fig. 1 shows this first and also last Lenoir engine of German
construction.
In the position of the piston, as shown in the diagram, the slide valve
(a) admits the mixture at the left side of the cylinder, while on the right
:sid_&gt; the slide valve (b) opens to the exhaust pipe. The inlet valve (a') is


controlled by a cam fixed on the crank-shaft. The cam profile is followed by
two rollers which arc held in place by a frame of wrought iron plates. The
exhaust valve (b) is operated by an ordinary eccentric. At the middle of the
stroke the valve (a) cuts off the influx of the gases. Immediately after this
the contact point (c) on the front end of the cross-head closes the circuit
between the guides (d) and (d'), which causes a continuous spark at the
plug (e). until the circuit is broken on the return stroke, when (c) leaves
the guide (d') and closes the circuit through the crankend ignition plug (e')
by making contact with (d"). The ignited mixture explodes with a pressure
of about 60 to 75 lbs. per square inch. Release occurs at the dead center at
a pressure of about 7 lbs./in2. Simultaneously with the opening of the
Lknoir Engine, 1861.
headend exhaust valve (b), the crankend exhaust valve is closed by the
same slide. After this the charging and combustion processes are repeated
in the crankend in the same manner as above stated for the headend.
The speed regulation of the engine shown in the cut, as in Lenoir
engines of the first few years, was obtained by adjusting the gas valve by
hand. The automatic regulation of the fuel by means of a centrifugal gov-
ernor was later accomplished by Marinoni after many tedious experiments.
The high tension ignition current was obtained from an induction coil, the
primary circuit of which was supplied with current from two large Bunsen
cells. These cells required a new sulphuric or nitric acid bath every three
or four days.
Th? cylinder walls and covers required very thorough cooling, and in
most cases the cooling water was used only once. Temporarily, however.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Lenoir used the evaporating cooling system with automatic water circulation,
very much as it is used today. The heat of the exhaust gases affected the
exhaust valves very strongly, causing warping and much friction. At the
richest mixture, which occurred at the heavy loads, the temperature at the
release point was sometimes as high as 1400 degrees Fahr. and conse-
quently friction of the exhaust valve very often increased, in spite of ex-
travagant oiling, to such an extent that it stopped the engine. Every change
in lubrication was followed by a noticeable change of speed. In the larger
types water was sprayed into the cylinder just before release in order to re-
duce the temperature of the gases before they passed through the valve.
Lenoir engines were built as large as 12 H. P. The 100 H. P. engines,
which were advertised right from the beginning existed on paper only. The
same is true of the gas locomotives, motor cars and fire engines which the
company recommended so heartily. The first publication concerning the new
engines which were given out as early as the summer of i860 were nothing
more than promiscuous exaggerations and indulged pathetically in funeral
dirges for the steam engine. Off-hand the builders and salesmen gave the
gas consumption per B. H. P. hr. at from 15.9 to 17.6 cubic feet and upon
this basis computed very deceptive and tempting operating costs. Steam
power seemed to be entirely lost and out of date. Then came the results of
tests by impartial experts and the equally important gas bills of the owners,
showing a gas consumption six times as high as that promised by the build-
ers.. The enthusiasm was at an end. As in the beginning, there had been
no limit to the praise of this motor, there was now no limit to the blame. The
really good features of the first gas engine were underestimated and were
discarded with its bad features. Of course it was a fuel and oil eater and
under varying load had an irregular and pounding movement, and the igni-
tion was the cause of much trouble; on the other hand, however, the engine
was simple in erection and operation, was always ready to start, cheaper in
initial cost than a steam plant and was not subjected to governmental regu-
lations. In small plants where the operation was not continuous or the fuel
cost was not an important factor, the Lenoir engine could be used very well,
and under these circumstances was superior to steam. Its operation, after
the primary difficulties of construction had been overcome, was dependable.
As a proof of this might be mentioned that long after the adoption of the
Otto 4-cycle engine, Lenoir engines were in daily use, and even today
Lenoir engines that are in a serviceable condition are occasionally found.

The Hugon Engine.
The success of the Lenoir engine produced a host of imitators and
rivals, several of whom set up a prior claim to the invention. One of the
latter was Mr. Hugon, manager of the Peris Compressed Gas Co., whose
original patent is dated September II, 1858. Apparently he was the in-
ventor of the engine which was later built and so well advertised by Lenoir.
But Hugon who studied the gas engine question with great care, was not so
optimistic as Lenoir and considered his solution of the problem so unsatis-
factory that he did not even publish it. Furthermore, his engine had a
lower fuel consumption than Lenoir's, which can be seen from the test
below. The later Hugon engines differed from the Lenoir engines as fol-
lows:
1. Having the inlet and exhaust valve combined in one slide valve which
allows good cooling of the ports by the incoming gases.
2. Injecting a small quantity of water into the cylinder to reduce the
temperature of explosion and release.
3. Using flame ignition which gave better flame propagation than with
electric ignition and therefore a higher efficiency.

The Bisschop Engine.
In 1871 Bisschop used the Lenoir cycle in a very original engine, the
design of which was far removed from that of current steam engine practice.
The engine was unique in construction and well fitted for the requirements
of small shops. The firm Mignon &amp; Rouart, of Pais, built this engine in
three small sizes, .04 H. P., .08 H. P.. and .33 H. P. However, larger types

were built by the German firm Buss, Sombart &amp; Co., of Madgeburg. On
account of the more efficient free piston engine of Otto, the distribution in
Germany was very limited.
(Fig. 6). The cylinder was provided with wide cooling webs arranged
logitudinally. This increased the cooling area 6 to 8 times and so water
cooling was eliminated. Immediately above the cylinder, and in line with it.
was placed a cylindrical crosshead guide, which was slotted on one side to
give room for the curved connecting rod. The top of this guide was closed
by a cap which contained a wick oiler to lubricate the crosshead. The piston
had three steel rings. The working piston and the piston valve were not
lubricated. An opening in the upper part of the cylinder allowed outside
air to be drawn in and expelled at every revolution, and in this way helped
to cool the cylinder. Intake and exhaust were controlled by the piston valve
(b) which received its motion from the crank shaft by means of an eccentric
and the walking-beam (a). Fig. 6 shows the piston in mid-position just
before ignition. When the piston is at the bottom of the cylinder, the valve
(b) has just closed the outlet (c). When the piston moves up, air is drawn
in through tube (d), and simultaneously the proper proportion of gas is
drawn in through the connection (e). Suction continues until midstroke.
when the piston uncovers the ignition channel (f)located in the cylinder wall.


This channel or chamber is closed by means of a little trap door opening into
the cylinder. At about mid-stroke, when the piston has uncovered this trap-
door, it is opened by the partial vacuum in the cylinder and the flame ignites
the mixture. The explosion pressure closes the trap door and drives the
piston out. The ignition flame is extinguished at every explosion. Im-
mediately below the ignition flame, there is a continuously burning lamp
Bisschop Engine.
which starts the ignition flame before the next stroke. At the ignition point
the valve (b) has not quite closed the inlet chamber (b'). For this reason,
special check valves are inserted in the gas and air pipes. At the end of the
out-stroke the lower end of the piston valve (b) opens the exhaust port (c)
through which the descending piston expels the burnt gases. The speed
was regulated by hand by adjusting the pinch cock (g) in the gas tube. In
the 0.5 and 1 II. P. engines made by the German firm, however, an automatic
governor was used. The bunsen burner (h) under the cylinder was lighted


191
shortly before starting to preheat the mixture and facilitate ignition. The
Bisschop engines made by the German firm had a more reliable ignition and
did not require this preheating.
The offset crankshaft requires some explanation. Diagram 7 gives the
ignition position in full lines and the dead center position in dotted lines. It
shows that explosion occurs when the connecting rod is nearly parallel to
the axis of the cylinder and almost perpendicular to the crank. In this way
the normal pressure on the cross-head guide is much reduced, and the maxi-
mum piston pressure is transmitted to the crank at the instant when it pro-
duces the greatest turning moment. In such an offset crank, the stroke is
greater than twice the radius of the crank. In the Bisschop engine, the
stroke was 12 to 15% greater than the crank diameter. The dead center
positions divide the crank pin path in two unequal parts in which angle o is
less than angle (3.
With direction of rotation as shown in the diagram, the larger angle fi
will he passed over during the upstroke and the smaller angle a during the
down-stroke. Since the angular velocity of the crank is practically constant,
the stroke in which the intake explosion and expansion occur is given more
time than the exhaust stroke. From a thermodynamical point of view, the
opposite would appear more correct. Apparently Bisschop preferred the
mechanical advantages.

Among the most zealous of those who tried to improve the gas engine,
was a young merchant, N. A. Otto, of Koln. His aim was to use the entire
stroke for the explosion and expansion. To obtain this, he built an experi-
mental machine in which the engine turned forward for the intake; then the
valves were closed and the fly-wheels turned backward to compress the
mixture, which was then ignited by hand. The effect was surprising. The
ignited mixture, on account of the compression, exploded with such violence
that the wheels rotated for some time at a high speed. This was more sur-
prising, since, when, the machine was operated without compression, it ran
at a low speed. So by these experiments (1861-1862), Otto without foresee-
ing the results arrived at the compression of the mixture before explosion,
ignition at the dead-center, and the accomplishment of the charging, com-
pression, combustion and discharging events in one cylinder—in short, he
came on the cycle which is the foundation of the internal combustion engine
development throughout the world. Great practical difficulties and insuffi-

cient technical experience, however, prevented Otto from appreciating the
great advantages of his cycle, and he abandoned it temporarily not realizing
how near he was to accomplishing his aim.
The great practical difficulty was that the violent explosions, which even
caused trouble in the Lenoir engine, were absolutely intolerable when com-
pression was used. Otto tried to prevent these shocks by substituting in his

second experimental engine an elastic member, in plac^ of the usual rigid
connection between piston and crank. This was to absorb the shock and
transmit the force to the crank gradually. But this experiment was not as
successful as he expected, which discouraged Otto to such an extent that he
abandoned work on this direct working engine.
A year later we find him experimenting with an atmospheric engine as
suggested by the engines of Brown, and Barsanti and Matteucci. lie had


193
learned from his second engine that cooling the gases of combustion caused
a great decrease in volume. This caused a partial vacuum and Otto en-
deavored to use this for the generation of power. Fig. 9 shows his original
atmospheric engine, which bears a striking resemblance to his second engine,
especially in the arrangement of the double free piston. The flat piston (a)

was to be driven upward by the explosion of the gases. A vacuum due to
over-expansion and cooling is created in the cylinder. In its upstroke piston
(a) displaces the air above it through the non-return clack valve (c) in the
main piston. After this both pistons are driven downward by the pressure
above.
The hollow piston rod (d) together with the rod from piston (a) forms
a dash-pot. Otto procured a patent on this, and by this means was able to


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
form a partnership with the Engineer Eugen Langen, to whom we owe the
systematic development of the atmospheric engine.
After many experiments, they perfected their engine in 1867, in time
for the Paris Exposition It stood in competition with fourteen direct work-
ing engines of French construction, most of which were of the Lenoir or
Hugon type. It was very strongly criticised. Laymen were even afraid of
the instantaneous ascent of the rack piston rod, and experts were as much
annoyed by the clicking noise of the pawls. Opinions, however, were sud-
denly changed. On account of the strongly urged proposal of the German
Prof. Reuleaux, one of the judges, a comparative test was run on all the
engines. This test showed the fuel consumption of the three types Lenoir,
Hugon, and Otto and Langen to be in the ratio 10:6:4.
On account of its great efficiency, the awkwardness and noise of the
Otto and Langen engine were overlooked, and the judges awarded them the
first prize. The photograph, Fig. 10, represents the engine exhibited. Every
detail was well thought out, and the design showed great originality. The
exterior is pleasing and almost beautiful, for the frame and cylinder were
made in the form of a Gre:k column. The later and larger types did not
use this ornamentation, as can be seen from Fig. 11.
An interesting feature of this engine was the manner in which the valves
were controlled. (Fig. 11.) The valve (e) by one in- and out-stroke causes
the exhaust, intake and explosion in the order named. It is moved by rod
(d) connected to crank (c). The elastic connection (d') is unique and is
worth notice. Explosion did not occur at every revolution of the fly-wheel
and under light load the wheel would rotate for several minutes between
explosions. It is clear then that the crank (c) could not rotate continuously
with the main shaft. To obtain this intermittent rotation a very ingenious
trip mechanism was used. The bell crank (f) is connected to the crank
(c) by a link, (b) is a continuously rotating ratchet wheel, (m) is a pawl
which can be engaged for rotation with (b). (Shown engaged.) It is,
however, kept out of engagement by the arm (1) of the bell crank (f)
when desired. The arm (f) moves with (f) and has connected to it the
vertical link (g).
The operation is as follows: When the piston is coming down the arm
(1) is in contact with the pawl (m). So (m) is disconnected from (b),
and the crank (c) and its connections are stationary. Towards the end of
the power stroke the stop (h) on the piston rod descends on the link (g).
This moves (f), (f) and the arm (1) through a small angle. (1) releases
(m) which engages (b), and the crank (c) rotates. After one revolution
(1) is back in position to disengage the pawl (m) and the rotation of the
crank (e) stops. Part of the turn of (c) allows the exhaust of the burnt
gases and opens the intake valve. Now (P) through link (g) and stop (h)
lifts the piston several inches to draw in the charge. Then the intake valve
closes, the explosion occurs and the valve is stationary until the next exhaust.
The pawl (m) is also controlled by the governor through the arm (n).
If the piston at the end of its power stroke causes (1) to release (m) the
arm (n) will hold (m) until he speed is below normal, and in this way will
retard the next explosion until it is needed.

The most economical speed was 75 R. P. M. Tests 6 and 7 run under
equal loads. During 6 a "'hit and miss" governor was used and in 7 a quality
governor was used. The decrease in efficiency in the latter case is very
noticeable.
The two ignition (lames used 1.5 cubic feet of gas per hour. Since this
is independent of the load and of the size of the engine, the ignition gas
should be expressed in terms of the II. P. and the following formula gives
the proper values:

According to the usual method it would be 19.3A635 = 30.4 cu. ft. which is
3 per cent greater. At loads greater than one II. P. the effect is the opposite.

water and radiation at 2^80 B. T. U. per hr. or about 4750 B. T. U. per

With very extravagant oiling only .27 lb. of oil was used in a 12 hour
run. In test 3 the average velocity of the piston for a complete up and
down stroke was 3.9'/sec. The average speed on the up-stroke, however,
exceeded 45'/sec.
Reithmann and Aimiiller.
At the time when Otto and Langen worked on their atmospheric gas
engine, a very interesting double acting free piston engine was originated
in Munich. For six years (1867-73) this small engine was running in the
shop of its inventor and builder, Christian Reithmann. In 1873 he success-
fully remodeled this engine into a four cycle machine.
The first engine had two pistons working in one cylinder. His engine,
however, required a very complicated pawl arrangement, which often
caused trouble and was one of the chief reasons why it was remodeled. No
tests were available.
b. Gas Engine With Compression.
The compression of the charge was the most important step in the
development of the internal combustion engine, and perhaps never again
will a single improvement cause such an increase in efficiency as was the
case with the utilization of compression. Compression was casually men-
tioned even in the old patent specifications of Lebon, Wright, Barnett and
others, however, definite knowledge of its effect on the efficiency was lack-
ing and practical suggestions as to its use were not made until he Lenoir
engine had appeared.
Gustave Schmidt, a German engineer and man of science, was the first
one publicly to suggest the use of compression. In a lecture in the Wien
Polytechnic Institute in 1861 he stated: "Results would be much more
satisfactory if compressors would be provided to compress the cold charge
to about 3 atmospheres before admission, by which a better expansion and
higher efficiency would be obtained."
Only one machine was built according to this idea, but his suggestion of
lengthening the cylinder to provide clearance was a good one and being
followed later has since been constantly used. It was at about this time that
Otto was experimenting with his first compression engine as described
earlier
Harlv in 1862 Beau de Rochas, a French civil railway engineer, pub-
lished a paper which, was really a treatise on steam engines, contained some
good suggestions for the improvement of the gas engine. Beau de Rochas
even recommends that the compression be carried on trial till ignition occurs.
He estimates the pressure required for ignition at 6 atmos., and the result-
ing explosion pressure at 30 atmos. The contents of this paper, however,
did not become generally known until it was brought up during the Otto
patent suits 20 years later. Other good suggestions concerning the use of
compression were made by the well-known German engineer, Win. Siemens.
His aim was to utilize the heat of the exhaust gases in regenerators. His
English patents, taken out i860 to 1864, concern a special kind of engine in
which the charge was led through the regenerators and so preheated before


197
ignition. Combustion was to take place at constant pressure. This cycle
was used later in the so-called ''constant pressure engines." Siemens never
made practical application of his ideas.
(1) Constant Pressure Engines.
Brayton.
Curiously, the first constant .pressure compression engine was built in
America. This engine was introduced by Brayton at Philadelphia in 1873.
As in the Otto types, the charge was compressed, but otherwise this engine
differed from all earlier types, and illustrated the principle of combustion
at constant pressure instead of at constant volume. It was a single acting,
two cycle motor with an impulse at every revolution. After compression
by a separate pump, the gas and air were delivered into the motor cylinder,
but they were not admitted cold and then ignited and exploded, according
to the usual cycle of operations. A small flame in direct communication
with the cylinder was kept constantly alight, and kindled the gases as they
passed it. Thus they were gradually ignited, and entering as flame, drove
the piston forward, not by the pressure of explosion but of combustion. The
heat was imparted to the gas at constant pressure—that is, the piston moved
as soon as the flames began to enter the cylinder, but there was no sudden
explosion. A wire gauze was fixed behind the light, to prevent the flame
from striking back into the compression chamber. This method of ignition
worked well as long as the wire gauze remained intact, but holes were liable
to burn into it, and when this occurred the flames struck back into the com-
pressed gases and a serious explosion followed. If this did not entirely
wreck the engine, it at least extinguished the ignition flame and stopped the
engine. On this account Brayton abandoned the use of gas in his engine and
substituted petroleum vapor.
Test of Brayton Engine.
But very few tests of this short-lived engine were made and these are
incomplete. The test made by Prof. Thurston will be given here:—
Nominal Rating 5 H.P. B.H.P., 398; I.H.P., 8.62.
Gas consumption per I.H.P. hr., 32 cu. ft.; Mech. Effy, 46 per cent.
These results are incorrect, since the work in the pump is included in

In spite of the compression, the efficiency of this engine was lower than that

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Simon Engine.
Simon and Beechy of Nottingham, the English licensees of Brayton's-
patents, attempted to improve the Brayton engine by adding a boiler to the
already complicated machine. The boiler was placed above the cylinder, and
the exhaust gases furnished the heat for the evaporation of the water. The
steam produced and injected into the motor cylinder increased the expansive
action of the gases and helped to lubricate the piston. This idea was not a
novelty. It had been tried by Hugon, but neither his engine nor the Simon
was practically improved by it. On this point Professor Schottler perti-
nently asks—"Whether it can be considered an advantage, since the gas
engine is expressly designed to avoid the defects and dangers of the steam
boiler, to add the latter to it."
Diesel Gas Engine.
In the same class with he Brayton and Simon constant pressure gas
engines, is the attempt of Diesel, twenty years later, to build a constant pres-
sure gas engine, after he had successfully built his exceedingly efficient oil
engine. The highly compressed fuel was injected through a needle valve
into the cylinder, which contained air under high pressure. As in the Bray-
ton and Simon engines, combustion was to occur at constant pressure.
Various factors caused the engine to be unsatisfactory. A heat efficiency of
27 per cent was obtained, but before that time an efficiency of 36 per cent
had been obtained by Diesel's oil engine. Combustion was incomplete on
account of improper mixing of the gas and air. This was the case even when
the gases used were rich and was much more noticeable when they were
poor.
From the three examples, Brayton, Simon and this attempt of Diesel,
it is apparent that a practical and economical constant pressure gas engine
has been found almost an impossibility.
bt. Explosion Engines.
If intake and compression of the change occur in the working cylinder
itself, instead of in a special charging pump, we have what is practically the
"four-cycle" principle. By this combination of working cylinder and charg-
ing pump into one cylinder, four strokes of the piston are necessary for
every power impulse. Three of these strokes are only a preparation of the
charge, and one is the working stroke.

To the Gas-Moteren Fabrik Deutz was given the German government
patent No. 532, protecting the four-cycle principle. This patent, dated Aug.
4, 1874, gave Dr. Otto's company a monopoly on four-cycle construction.
Suit to set this patent aside was filed by a number of other manufactures
and in i&lt;886, after a four years trial, one of the patent clauses was nullified


199
by the courts, and the four-cycle principle became common property. Two-
cycle engines, which had become common during the Deutz four-cycle
monopoly, disappeared almost entirely.
This patent decision had a wonderful effect on the gas engine industry,
as well as on other industries, and was the end of the most important trial
of that period, and the beginning of a new epoch of development.
The reasons for the decision were two in number:
First, Beau de Rochas had, as early as 1861, published a pamphlet
recommending the four-cycle engine, and had in 1862 procured the French
patent on same. Second, in 1873, one year before the date of Otto"s patent
and four years before the construction of the Otto four-cycle engine. Chris-
tian Reithmann. a jeweler of Munich, had a successful four-cycle engine in
operation in his shop, which he used for many years for driving his machines.
It cannot be claimed therefore that Otto was the inventor or even the
first builder of the engine named after him, although it should be said in
justice to him that his work seems to have been done without knowledge of
the work of Beau de Rochas or of Reithmann, and that he accomplished the
most successful pioneer work in gas engine construction.
Beau de Rochas.
The idea of the four-cycle engine was, without doubt, first originated
in the mind of Alphonse Beau de Rochas, a French railway engineer. It
was published in a pamphlet in 1861, and a part of his suggestion is given
herewith, "the following operations must then take place on one side of the
cylinder, during one period of four consecutive strokes:
I. Drawing in the charge during one whole piston stroke.
II. Compression during the following stroke.
III. Inflamation at the dead point, and expansion during the third
stroke.
IV. Discharge of the burnt gases from the cylinder during the fourth
and last stroke."
Beau de Rochas never constructed an engine according to his sugges-
tions. It is apparent that he did not see or at least did not explain how to
practically apply his ideas. He evidently understood that a clearance space
would be necessary in an engine of his description and that part of the
burnt gases would remain in the cylinder. But he did not give any sugges-
tion as to the effect of these gases on the combustion of the n?xt charge.
Reithmann.
As above stated Reithmann built the first four-cycle gas engine in
1872-73. Fig. 12 is a cross-sectional view of this engine.
On page 16 we gave a short description of Reithmann's and Aimuller's
double acting atmospheric free piston engine. In spite of Reithmann's
wonderful work very little credit or recognition has been given him until
recently. Not a word concerning this engine can be found in English text-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
books, and the first recognition given him in German scientific circles was
in 1902 when Giildner published his well-known hook, "Entwerfen, und
Berechnen der Verbrennungs Motoren."
Below the piston (a) is the clearance space (b) at the bottom of which
is placed the exhaust valve (c). From the air valve (d) and the small gas
valve (e) a channel leads to the cylinder through the large slide valve (f).
Ignition occurs by means of a flame and flame-valve. The air and gas inlet
valves, the exhaust valve and the ignition apparatus are controlled by the
half speed shaft (i).
Kkithmann 4-Cycle Engine.
During the first one-third of the first outstroke the piston draws in air
only through the valve (d), then the valve (e) opens and gas and air are
drawn in together until the stroke is completed. At the upper dead point
the values (d) and (e) are closed and the downstroke compresses the charge.
Ignition occurs at the lower dead point and the gases expand during a com-
plete stroke. The exhaust valve opens at the upper dead point.

Otto.
(1861). The second attempt of Otto to build a gas engine was in 1861-
62 when he built the machine sketched in Fig. 13. The four cylinders each
contained two pistons; the pistons (a) were secured to the piston rods (c),
while the pistons (b) were loose in their cylinders. (See page 13). The
object of this construction was to have the shock of the explosion in the
combustion cylinder taken up by the piston (b) and gradually transmitted to
the piston (a) by means of the air cushion between the two. During the
exhaust stroke the air between the pistons was to expand and drive the loose


20I
piston to the extreme end of the cylinder. This was a very ingenious way
of obtaining perfect scavenging in an engine using compression.
Otto never got this engine started. There were several reasons why-
it was impractical. First, the excessive noise and wear due to the loose
auxiliary pistons. Second, the variable point of ignition. Third, the perfect
scavenging of the cylinders caused very sudden explosions which produced
intense shocks on the engine parts.
After Otto had worked for one year in a vain attempt to overcome

these difficulties he abandoned this type of engine and applied himself for
15 years to the development of the Otto and Langen free piston engine (as
described earlier).
Otto.
(1877). Otto's third engine was introduced to the public at the Paris
Exposition of 1878, similar to the introduction of the Otto and Langen
engine a decade earlier. Seventy-five engines were exhibited at the expo-
sition. Among these were several engines of "the new Otto four-cylcle
type." The gas consumption of these Otto engines was approximately equal
to that of the Otto and Langen atmospheric engine (economical efficiency
15%). but the engines distinguished themselves from those of other firms
by their quiet, steady motion, small floor space, much greater specific
capacity, and above all, the combination of charging pump and gas engine in
one cylinder, advantages which soon made this engine favorably known
throughout the world.
The great simplicity obtained by the alternate use of the cylinder as
pump and motor, diminishes the number of valves necessary and reduces
the resistance to the incoming gases, while entirely preventing any loss due
to ports, in transferring the gases from one cylinder to another. The carry-
ing out of the cycle is mechanically almost perfect, little work being spent


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
which is not included in the theory. Furthermore, the piston is fully in at
the moment of ignition, and is practically at rest. The heat, producing
maximum temperature, is therefore added at nearly constant volume. The
highest pressure which the gas present is capable of producing is, therefore,
attained at the beginning of the stroke simultaneously with the highest
temperature. The expansion is very rapid, and so no unnecessary waste of
heat occurs, since the temperature is rapidly depressed by the work being
done. The united effect of all these factors can be seen in the perfect dia-
gram in Fig. 14.
The losses incurred in the operation of the cycle will be fully discussed
later in lectures on the thermodynamics of the internal combustion engine.
One of the first "new Otto" engines is shown in Fig. 15. The cylinder
(a) has a clearance space (a') about 2/3 of the piston displacement. The

entrance of the gas and air, as well as the ignition, is controlled by the slide
valve (b). Exhaust occurs through the valve (c). (b) is operated by the
small crank (d) while (c) is controlled by the cam (e), both being con-
nected to the half-speed shaft (f). The gas valve (g) is operated by the
cam (g').
At the beginning of the intake stroke the exhaust valve (c) is closed,
while the slide valve (b) has moved its air channel to communicate with
'the channel (i) of the cylinder head. Air alone is drawn in for the first
part of the stroke, which is supposed to force the burnt gases of the clear-
ance space against the receding piston. In the meantime the valve (b) has
moved far enough to open the gas inlet, while the cam fg') has opened the
gas valve (g), so that gas and air enter the cylinder simultaneously to the
end of the stroke. Now the slide (b) closes the port (i) and the charge is
■ compressed into the clearance space by the returning piston. During this


203
time the slide (b) has moved to the right, and the ignition port (k) is op-
posite the part (i) so that flame is carried through (i) into the clearance
space (a'). Ignition occurs on dead center and the charge explodes to about
10 at. pressure. At the end of the expansion stroke the valve (c) is opened
and exhaust occurs during the next stroke. The burnt gases in the compres-
sion space cannot be expelled, but remain and become a part of the next
charge.
Governing is by the ''hit and miss" principle. When the speed rises
above normal, the governor shifts the cam (g') along the shaft (f), until
the came no longer strikes the lever (1) of the valve (g). The latter re-
mains closed and the engine misses until the speed drops to normal. During
these strokes only air is drawn in and the cylinder is thoroughly scavenged.
That this has a good influence can be seen from the diagram of Fig. 16.

Later (for precision regulation) instead of the cylindrical cam (g'), a
conical cam was used, which operated so that when above normal speed the
gas valve (g) was only partially opened. Less gas entered and the ratio of
gas and air was decreased, the quantity of the charge being constant.
The composition and arrangement of the charge in the cylinder of
Otto's engine remained an open question for many years, and played an'
important part in the suits against Patent 532. Otto believed that the
economy of his engine was due to a certain stratification of the gases of the
charge, which view was defended by Prof. Slaby and other authorities on


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
thermo-dynamics. In his patent claims Otto states, "At the end of the
intake stroke, three distinct layers, or strata, of gas are present in the cyl-
inder; next to the piston is a layer of burnt gases remaining from the
previous explosion. The second layer is pure air admitted during the first
part of the intake stroke, and the third strata, a mixture of gas and air, is
located next to the cylinder head. This stratification is probably partly-
lost during compression, but the order is retained, although the divisions may
not be clearly defined. When the charge is ignited at the dead center, the
flame does not immediately fill the whole cylinder, but begins with the
richest mixture near the cylinder head and is gradually propogated from
layer to layer until the whole charge is burnt. The combustion, therefore,
is not a sudden one. but purposely retarded to prevent the shock of a sudden
explosion." In order to facilitate this formation of strata. Otto originally
used a conical clearance space, which he later abandoned in favor of a long
inlet channel.
That there really was a gradual combustion of the charge in Otto's
first engines, (which was nothing more than a decided "afterburning") is
shown by indicator cards of his engine. (See Fig. 17.) For this purpose,
however, it is not necessary to have a stratified charge, for every improperly
mixed or poorly ignited charge burns slowly, especially when low com-
pression pressure is used, as was the case in the early Otto engines. The
phenomenon of slow combustion, which Otto considered as the principal
cause of the efficiency and smooth operation of his engine, is today rightly
considered an undesirable condition and is prevented when possible. This
question lias been discussed by many well-known experts on Internal Com-
button Engineering and is not completely settled today. A good discussion
is given in Clerk Gas Petrol and Oil Engines, pages 37 to 47, and Zeitschrift
der Vereines Deutscher Ing. Vol. XXX, page 209.
Otto engines in small sizes, (1-6 to Yz H. P.) were sold in great num-
bers and supplied a real want in small industries. In these types the valves
were simplified, the inlet slide was abolished and one valve controlled the
gas and air intake. Later hot tube and electric ignition was used. About
this time the crosshead was considered unnecessary and the simple construc-
tion common today was adopted.
The capacity also was developed greatlv. In 1878 the largest engine
sold was 4 H. P.; in 1880. 20 H. P.; 1885, 80 H. P.; 1889, ioo H. P.; in
1893, 200 H. P.; in 1900, 1000 H. P., and in 1910 engines of 4000 H. P.
units were delivered.
The gradual increase in capacity and efficiency was properly accom-
panied by many experiments along new lines. The most important of these
was a three cylinder "compound" engine built in 1879 for the purpose of
increasing the efficiency by increased expansion. The two outside cylinders
operated alternately in the usual 4-cycle way, but exhausted their gases after
partial expansion into the center cylinder where they were completely ex-
panded. This (center) cylinder, therefore gave an impulse every revolu-
tion. The engine gave satisfactory results and was commercially operated
for many years, but today is no longer built.

After Otto.
Immediately after the nullification of Clause 4 of the Deutz Co., Patent
No. 532 (Jan. 1886), many new types of four-cycle engines appeared on the
market. Most of them, however, were soon abandoned. In the next few
pages only those engines of this period will be mentioned that have some
special feature or an unusual efficiency to recommend them to our attention.
During the first few years Otto developed only the horizontal slide
valve engine, but most of his competitors adopted the vertical type poppet
valve engine with crank shaft above the cylinder.
Uoutzky.
The first constructor to get away from this general type was the Ger-
man engineer, Loutzky, who built an engine with cylinder above. In 1888
he exhibited an engine of this type provided with hot tube ignition. By a
unique arrangement of the valves in the cylinder head he obtained an ap-
proximately hemispherical compression space, entirely free from channels
or pockets. (See Fig. 18.) He obtained an efficiency that is seldom excelled
even now. although he used a compression of only 4 at. The efficiency must,
therefore, be attributed to the shape of the compression space.


207
Loutzky Engine, 1895.
Delamare-Deboutteville and Malandin.
The French Engineers Delamare, Deboutteville and Malandin intro-
duced a small four-cycle engine, their "Moteur Simplex," in 1884. These
daring French engineers showed great initiative in the design of large
engines. In 1889 they exhibited a 100 H. P. one cylinder, single acting
engine, using a 6 to 8 at. compression pressure and 20-22 at. explosion pres-
sure, a construction that was certainly remarkable in view of the inferior
materials of construction and the limited knowledge of design at that period.
Within rive years, however, they followed with engines of 300, 700 and then
1000 H. P. in one cylinder. The dimensions of the latter engine were 51"
bore, 56" stroke and a speed of 80 R. P. AT. Later (1901) the well-known
machine company, Cockerill, of Seraing, built these engines in the double-
acting type.
Charon.
• Charon was one of the first to attempt "increased expansion" as a means
of increasing the efficiency. He obtains this by the simple means of allowing
part of he charge taken in to be expelled back into a specially provided
chandler. Compression does not begin until near the middle of the com-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
pression stroke. In this way he obtains a low volumetrc efficiency but a
high expansion. The governor controlled the amount of the charge expelled
before compression and in this way regulated the speed. The efficiency,
though fairly good, was not as high as might have been expected from the
great expansion obtained. This was attributed to the fact, that since the
clearance volume remained constant and the volume of the charge varied,
the compression pressure also varied. (The most efficient comp. press, was
obtained with a full charge). The efficiency, therefore, increased rapidly
with the load from 11% at 1-3 load to 26.4% at full load.
Crossley Brothers {Manchester, England).
This firm, though formerly the English licensees of Otto's patents, soon
became independent. They developed several lines of engines of very unlike
construction. One of these was the "Scavenging Engine" designed by
Atkinson in 1S92, in which he made use of the momentum of the exhaust
gases for drawing a charge of air through the clearance space at the end of
the exhaust stroke. To increase the momentum, he used a long (Clerk
gives 65 feet) straight, and uniform exhaust pipe. Toward the end of the
exhaust stroke, when the velocity of the piston decreases, the momentum of
the gas column in the exhaust pipe causes a partial vacuum in the clearance
space. By opening the air valve at this time, a charge of air was drawn
through the clearance space and out of the exhaust ports. This is completed
when the piston was moved out one-tenth of its stroke. Then the exhaust
closes and the intake begins.
This engine had several disadvantages which quite overbalanced the
perfect scavenging obtained.
Wcstinghouse.
After many experiments, the Westinghouse Machine Co., of Pittsburg,
produced a vertical (4-cycle) gas engine in 1896, which has many interesting
features. This engine resembled their vertical steam engine. (S*e same in
Lab. ) It was the first practical 4-cycle American made engine put on the
market. In 10 to 85 H. P. sizes, two cylinders were used, with cranks ar-
ranged on same side of shaft. Large models up to 600 H. P. had 3 cylinders
with cranks at an angle of 1200. The design of all these engines provided
for good balancing of the parts.
(Fig. 19.) The half-speed cam shaft (A) operates only the exhaust
valve (E). Two shafts, not shown in Fig. 19, connect shaft (A) with the
half-speed shaft (B), which operates the inlet valve (j) by means of the
lever (C) and igniter (F) through the rod (D). The mixing valve (M)
supplies all the cylinders and is connected with the various inlet parts by
means of the manifolds (M). (M) contains a balanced valve by means of
which the governor throttles the gas and air supply. This is the first example
of a quantity governor we have met. The water-jacket is extended along
the cylinder only as far as the top of the piston when it is in its lowest
position. The cooling water outlet is usually connected to the exhaust pipe
(o), to avoid the use of a special water pipe and also to assist in cooling


the exhaust valve (E). The water is expelled with the exhaust. The
crank case is partly filled with oil, and the lubrication of crank shaft, con-
necting rod and piston is by the "splash system."
In order to start the larger engines one of the cylinders is operated by
compressed air until the other two have begun exploding. For starting, a
YVestinghouse Engine.
special set of cams to operate one of the cylinders in two-cycle, is provided.
These can be controlled by the lever shown to the right of shaft A in Fig. 19.
Many tests of Westinghouse engines of this type have been made and
various results obtained. The mechanical efficiency runs as high as 90%, the
thermal efficiency as high as 25^2% and the M. E. P. over 6 1-3 atmospheres.
The effect of the short water-jacket was two-fold. A favorable effect was
the decrease in amount of cooling water; an unfavorable effect was the


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
increased temperature of the exhaust gases. For this reason we have an
unusual heat balance:
Heat transformed into work 28.5%
Heat lost in exhaust and radiation 40.8ro
Heat lost to cooling water 38-7?o
"Compare with heat balance of Otto engine, page 24."
Rollason-Beck.
This English engine uses the six-stroke cycle, in which the 5th stroke
draws in air through the inlet valve and the sixth-stroke expels it through
the exhaust. The purpose of this extra revolution is to get better scaveng-
ing than is possible with the 4-stroke cycle. Schottler suggests that the six-
cycle was used only to avoid infringing Otto's patents. Whatever the origi-
nal motive may have been it is a fact that these engines were made long
after Otto's monopoly had been removed in 1886.
An interesting feature of this engine was the use of an air jacket be-
tween water jacket and cylinder walls to prevent undue heat losses to the
cooling water.
The six-cycle does not require any unusual constructive features,
except that the cam shaft has 1-3 the speed of the crank shaft and that two
extra cams are provided to open the inlet and exhaust valves during the
5th and 6th stroke respectively. The expansion obtained in this engine was
almost a perfect adiabatic, which show's that the extra attention given to
scavenging was not wihout good results.
Griffin.
This English engine was also of the six-cycle type, but was double
acting. We see that where steadiness of operation, or high power was re-
quired, designs returned to the double acting engine.
General.
The development of the four-cycle engine has been very rapid in the
last 15 years, but the study of these modern engines, enumerated on page 5,
A, b, 1/, a", 11-19, especially of their mechanical details, can better be done
by inspection of the engines themselves, and by the study of the catalogs
and trade bulletins of manufacturers.
(b2). The Two-Stroke Cycle.
The denomination of internal combustion engines according to their
cycle was not followed until after the introduction of the "new Otto." the
operation of which could best be named by the number of strokes required
for a full working cycle. Formerly they distinguished only between the
"single acting" and the "double acting" types, which distinction is used today
only in connection with the name of the cycle.
After Otto had shown that even a compressed mixture could be ex-
ploded in an engine cylinder without harmful shocks, many attempts were


211
made to apply compression to two-cycle engines. Very few foresaw the
real value of the four-cycle. In comparison with the steam or the Lenoir
engine there was a tendency to consider Otto's "half acting cycle" as a
retrogression. And the construction of the two-cycle engine seemed so
simple! But later, when it was shown that on account of practical difficul-
ties, the two-cycle could not be built to run as efficiently as the four-cycle,
the opinion was suddenly reversed. The Deutz four-cycle monopoly, which
had hardly been noticed before this, handicapped the whole industry, and
other Herman manufactures carried on the light against Patent 532. until
the four-cycle was given free to the world. And this meant the undeserved
downfall of the two-cycle engine, at a time when it was only partially
developed.
Purely from a technical point of view, the nullification of the four-
cycle patents was a great disadvantage to the whole gas engine industry.
The monopoly of four-cycle construction had forced the study and develop-
ment of the two-cycle.
For more than ten years, work on two-cycle engines was abandoned,
hut was resumed in the nineties, and two-cycle engines, even in very large
sizes, are commercially built today. Competition between the two-cycle and
four-cycle types is strong even now, although the four-cycle is still leading.
It is an open question among experts as to which engine will have the
supremacy in the future.
Two-cycle engines can be classified according to their manner of re-
moving the exhaust gases:
1. Expelling Engine.
2. Scavenging Engine.
3. Suction or Exhauster Engine.
1. In this engine the exhaust gases are forced out by the instroke of the
piston. In the Lenoir and other early engines this method was used.
2. In this type, air under about 4 or 5 pounds gage pressure is used to
flush out the clearance space.
Examples: Clerk, Oechelhauser and Junkers, Benz, Mietz, and Weiss
and others.
3. In this type, a special pump was provided to draw the exhaust gases
out of he clearance space. Examples: Dr. Lange, Radovanovic.
Clerk.
Perhaps the earliest fairly successful worker was Clerk, who com-
menced to experiment upon two-cycle engines soon after Otto perfected his
four-cycle machine. It was, however, not until 1880 that he succeeded in
producing a serviceable machine. Fig. 20 and 21, both from Clerk, "The
Gas and Oil Engine," show a vertical and horizontal cross-section respec-
tively. The operation of the engine is as follows: In Fig. 21 the power
piston, C, has just reached the outer dead center and the main bulk of the
exhaust gases have escaped through the ports E E'. In the meantime the
displacer piston. D, which on its previous suction stroke has drawn a mixture

of air and gas into L&gt;, has completed about half of its in stroke and dis-
placed the mixture into G and A through the connecting pipe, E. About the
time D has completed its in stroke, the piston C, has covered the exhaust
ports on its return stroke, and compression ensues inthe main cylinder. The
cylinder volumes are so proportioned that in theory no mixture can be lost
through the exhaust ports. At the inner dead center of the power piston, C,
or just before, the igniting cavity, O, Fig. 21, comes opposite the port, N,
and the charge is fired. The piston is impelled forward and the next charge,

the pressure in A has fallen enough, after the beginning of exhaust, to cause

the suction of the displacer piston, D, passes through the valve, H, and in
so doing is mixed with gas which enters through a number of fine holes in
the seat of the valve from the annular space, K. On the in stroke of the
displacer piston the mixture under some pressure comes in under the valve,
F, which it lifts as soon as the pressure of the exhaust gases above it has
fallen low enough.
The difficulty under which the engine labored was loss of mixture
through the exhaust ports and consequent low economy. Although the
respective volumes of the two cylinders may be in the proper ratio, the
charge expands by heat on the transfer, and mechanical agitation favors
the loss. In spite of this defect shopt tests on 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 horse-power
engines in 1885 gave results fully equal to those obtained on the four-cycle
machine of that day. The following table shows the results of some of these
tests.

U'ittig and Hecs.
This engine, built in Linden in 1880, had two cylinders with coincident
cranks. One of these was the working cylinder and the other was a pump
to compress the charge. While the motor cylinder was making its out-stroke,
the pump drew in a charge. The exhaust valve opened on the outer dead
point and remained so for .6 to .7 of the return stroke. At this point it was
closed, the intake valve opened, and the charge, which had been compressed
in the pump in the meantime, was transferred to the motor cylinder and
further compressed during the remainder of the stroke. Ignition occurred
at the inner dead point.
The efficiency of this engine was very much lower than Otto's engines
of that period. Also, the operation was not dependable, and dangerous
explosions in the charging pump were of frequent occurrence.
Bene.
The firm Benz and Co., of Mannheim, built their first two-cycle
engine in 1884. This engine was of the horizontal cross-head type. It was,
however, single-acting, since the crank end of the cylinder was used as a
compression pump. On the instroke the pump drew in air and discharged,
during the outstroke, into a receiver in the base of the engine, where a
pressure of 3 to 6 lbs. per square inch was maintained. The cylinder exhaust
opened at the end of the expansion stroke and the pressure rapidly dropped
to atmospheric. When the cylinder pressure equaled the receiver pressure,


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the air valve opened and a quantity of air swept through the cylinder and
out of the exhaust pipe to scavenge the clearance space. At the middle of
the instroke the exhaust closed, a moment later the intake valve. Compres-
sion occurred during the rest of the stroke. In the meantime, a small gas
pump, the piston of which is connected to the crosshead, discharged a
quantity of gas into the cylinder. Ignition by means of an electric spark
occurred at the inner dead point.
The efficiency of this engine was satisfactory at normal load, unsatis-
factory, however, at low loads. The manufacture was given, up by the
Benz Co., in 1894, although engines of this type were built by other firms
for a number of years.
Mictc and Weiss.
This engine, made in New York, has enjoyed an extensive sale in this
country and Europe. It is a close copy of the German engine of Sohnlein.
(See engine in Mechanical Lab.).
Oechelliiittser and Junkers.
This two-cycle engine had three cranks, operating two pistons in one
cylinder. The first engine was built in 1893. Construction is very similar
to the Oechelhauser engine described below.
Occhcllidiieser (1896).
The demand for large power engines, and the application of blast-
furnace and coke-oven gases to drive them, have brought this striking motor
to the front. In some respects it resembles the first Atkinson engine, known
as the Differential. The latter had not an air pump, like the Oechelhaueser,
but in both motors, valve gear is practically dispensed with. As hitherto
made, the Oechelhaueser has one long cylinder open at both ends, with two
pistons, performing between them the functions of admission and com-
pression of the charge, and discharge of the exhaust gases. There is no
cam shaft, and the valves usually driven by it are replaced by ports un-
covered and shut off by the motor pistons during their stroke. These pistons
work in the horizontal cylinder in opposite directions on to the same crank-
shaft, through three cranks 180° apart. The two outer cranks are con-
nected by rods and crossheads with a cross piece at the back of the cylinder,
through which the piston of the back cylinder works. The double-acting
pump on the same axis as the motor cylinder is at the back of the cross-
piece, and its piston is driven from it.
Fig. 22 gives a plan of the engine, and illustrates the action. G is the
air pump, Kj and K2 the two motor pistons. Beginning with the point in
the stroke, where the two pistons are almost close together, the charge of
gas and air between them is compressed within very small limits to a pres-
sure of 8 or to pounds above atmospheric pressure. Electric ignition fol-
lows, and the two pistons are driven apart by the pressure of explosion,
which is in proportion to the heating value of the gas used, and sometimes
reaches 355 lbs. per square inch (25 atmospheres). Work is thus done by


both pistons on the crank (double motor stroke). Meanwhile the piston of
the air pump G has drawn in fresh air through the automatic valve S, and
the return stroke of this piston compresses it on its front face, and passes
it at a slight pressure through D and the air chamber R into the compres-
sion space. On the back face of this piston another series of operations are
simultaneously carried out. Here a mixture of gas and air is drawn in
through another automatic valve X, and compressed by the pump piston
through o into the mixing chamber P, which it enters at the same pressure
as the air in R. Piston K, having passed the outer dead point of the center
crank, now begins to uncover the exhaust ports C,, and the products of
combustion are driven out. Piston K; next uncovers the air port A, and the
air under pressure rushes from R into the motor cylinder, sweeping out the
Oechelhanser 2-Cvcle Engine.
burnt products before it, and forming an effective scavenger charge. The
admission port Q is then uncovered by piston K2 and the charge of gas and
air, compressed to about 7 lbs. per square inch, enter the motor cylinder.
The makers of the engine assert that none of this fresh charge escapes
through the exhaust with the scavenger blast of air, because the volume of
the cylinder is so proportioned that, even when running at maximum load
and power, the charge only occupies about 70 per cent of it. Both motor
pistons now begin the return stroke, the mixture is compressed between
them, and the cycle recommences.
If there are only slight variations in the speed, the governor acts upon
the relative proportions of gas and air, and alters the composition of the
charge; if the speed is varied within wider limits, it regulates the quantity
of the charge through the mixing valve cock H and the return slide valve
V in the passage D. Part of the compressed charge passes from o into the
suction pipe N, and is thence transferred to the other side of the pump, in-
stead of passing, as usual, to the motor cylinder. In the latest system type,
the governor acts separately upon the admission of gas and of air.
In this interesting engine compression, ignition, and expansion of the
charge occupy respectively seven-eights of the stroke, while admission and
exhaust are effected during the remaining one-eighth of each stroke. Fig..


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
23 show s an indicator diagram; the exhaust opens at a, and at c compression
of the gases up to 140 lbs. per square inch begins. An unusual feature is
that water is sprayed onto the exhaust gases to cool them. The latest
engines are fitted with two electric igniters. In some motors, gas alone enters
through the admission ports, and the charge is formed in the motor cylinder
itself; this arrangement depends upon the kind of gas used.
The advantages of the Oechelhaeser cycle are that a motor stroke is
obtained at each revolution instead of at every other revolution, and as this
is effected by two working pistons, the power is said to be increased four-
fold. The necessity for two cylinders, motor and pump, does not cause
difficulty, because for large powers two cylinders are practically indispens-
able. Admission and exhaust are effected in one stroke instead of in two
and the cylinder dimensions are smaller for the same power than in the four-
cycle type. Thus a 1,000 H. P. single-cylinder Oechelhaueser engine has a
cylinder diameter of only 26.8 inches —935 mm. For work with poor gases,
the simplicity of the long smooth cylinder, without the complication of a
-cylinder head and valve chest, and the absence of valves are also advantages,
because dust cannot settle in the working parts. The only external gear
required is a small auxiliary shaft to drive the governor, igniters, and the
starting valve. When used for blast-furnace work, the blowing engines
can, it is said, be driven direct from the motor piston without a stuffing-box,
and can themselves be utilized, as at Horde, to supply the scavenging charge
of air. On the other hand, the engine has three cranks and three connecting
rods and two pistons, and the connections are somewhat complicated. The
governing at first was said not to act efficiently, but this has now been
remedied.
The mechanical efficiency of these engines was about 80% and the
econ. efficiency as higli as 28%.
Korting.
Messrs. Korting designed many engines, the first of which were built
in 1882. Later (1898) this firm was very active in the development of large
double-acting two-cycle engines and their product is today one of the best
known in Europe. The manufacture is carried on in this country by the
De La Vergne Machine Co., of New York, who have installed plants with
a capacity of 42,000 H. P. (See Journal A. S. M. E., 1910), pages 1361-1466.
The Korting engine described below is of the two-cycle double-acting
type. (Fig- 24.) The water cooled piston (b), the length of which is
about }i of the stroke, moves in the main cylinder (a). A small crank,
about 1100 ahead of the main crank, operates the air pump (c) and the gas
pump (d). The latter are controlled by the piston valves (c') and (d').
Mixing of gas and air occurs in the housing of the intake valve (e). Both
sides of the cylinder discharge into the common exhaust port (f), which is
alternately opened to the crank and head ends of the cylinder by the move-
ment of the piston. When the exhaust ports are uncovered, the pump pistons
have completed about half their stroke. Up to this time, the intake channel
of the pump (d) remains open, and so about 40% of the gas drawn in during
the previous stroke is expelled back into the supply pipes. Now the valve


217
(d') closes this channel and opens the discharge channel, which allows the
rest of the gas to enter the engine cylinder. Just before this occurs a charge
of air has been admitted to scavenge the cylinder. The scavenging and
intake continue until the pump is at the end of its stroke, which is just the
time when the returning piston covers the port (f). The enclosed charge is
compressed to 10-12 atmospheres and exploded by two electric igniters. Two
are used to insure a reliable ignition and a more efficient flame propagation.
In the first engines the speed was regulated by throttling the gas, but this
Kortuxc Engine.
caused a great loss in the pump when running under light load, and so in
later engines the governor controlled the intake valve of the gas pump (d),
so that under light loads a larger part of the gas is expelled back into the
supply pipes. Baffle plates (g) are provided to prevent the incoming charge
from escaping through the exhaust ports (f).
The economical efficiency «w of these engines was very good, running
from 17 to 24%. Mechanical efficiency 62% to 71%.

L. J. WATSON
It has been said that inventive gen-
ius always rises to meet the demands
placed upon it. It can be said, too,
that there is invariably an element of
commercialism which rises to oppose
and suppress the work of the invent-
or, notwithstanding the common be-
lief that manufacturers are always
ready and anxious to take hold of im-
provements in their line which have
been proven of intrinsic value.
Every inventor is likely to get the
idea, before he goes far, that he is a
victim of an unjust and galling com-
mercial restraint. Whether he is, or
whether he is not, there are two sides
to the question, which all fair minded
persons will admit, and which no one
can truthfully deny.
Admitting that the great majority
of inventors can be expected to at-
tach exaggerated importance to, and
over-estimate the value of, their al-
ledged improvements, and further ad-
mitting that some so-called improve-
ments are impractical or are not im-
provements at all, there are a few that
are decided improvements, and it is
in behalf of these few that this paper
has been written.
These few have to forego the oppo-
sition of the people, some of which
are uninformed in the line to which
the invention pertains and, as a result,
are skeptical, and others who do un-
derstand and can see in it a commer-
cial competition which they fear, and
which they may seek to destroy by any
available means.
Taking up one side of the question,
of which we have said there were two
sides, it is easy to see that any new
and useful improvement is sure to
threaten the market of some other
similar device of established use, the
demand for which must naturally fall
off in proportion as a demand for the
improved article may grow.
Naturally, then, the manufacturers
and promoters of the old staples join
in opposition, and try to discourage
any improved device which tends to
detract from their established busi-
ness, and every argument in their fa-
vor is made use of by them to hold
their existing trade and to smother the
new invention. They will say their
goods meet every requirement of the
business, as demonstrated by the gen-
eral satisfaction they are giving their
customers.
Their customers by the way seldom
know of the improvement and do not
appreciate its advantages. They have
become reconciled to the old way of
doing things, no matter how primitive
they may be—in other words, their
contentment is mainly due to their
supposition that what they have is the
best there is to be had.
After the new article has been in-
troduced in the market (should the
inventor succeed to this extent) they
point to the risk of buying a device
in the experimental stages; the con-
fusion and expense which changes al-
ways entail; the added variety of re-
pairs that it will be necessary for the
middle-man to carry in stock, etc., etc.
If. after having made use of every
truthful argument, they find the new
invention still advancing, they may
then be expected to resort to under-
handed methods, and use sheer force,
if they are in position to do so, to
crush out the life of the newly launch-
ed enterprise.
This is especially true if the new


219
invention is an appliance or fixture
that is bought by one manufacturer,
from another, to sell with his machine
as a whole to the consumer, the man
who buys the machine and wears it
out In this case it is plain to be seen
that the manufacturer of the large
machine, who buys the fixture of some
other concern to equip his machine
with, is prone to use that which is
cheapest just as long as said cheap
fixture will be accepted by the general
trade.
If the prospective purchaser is not
aware of the better fixture, they aim
and hope to keep him in the dark if
possible, and if he learns about it they
do not hesitate to belittle and condemn
it in every way.
No matter how much better for the
user the improved fixture may be, they
will not use it at a greater cost until
forced by their patrons to do so. In-
stances are recorded where Patent
Rights to new inventions of merit
have been bought by manufacturers
and corporations at very attractive
prices, only to be pigeon-holed and
kept from interfering with their stand-
ard and staple old-fashioned methods
and devices. Naturally, less expensive
means will be first resorted to.
For the manufacturer of any ma-
chine to decline or refuse to install
improvements, or to adopt an im-
proved fixture for their machines be-
cause said fixture costs a little more
than the old-style one they may have
been using for years, would, in the
opinion of the writer, be following a
narrow-minded and manifestly very
selfish policy, a policy which bids fair
to defeat their very purpose of doing
it, which, it is safe to assume, is to in-
crease the profits to be derived from
their business. Of course it may
mean a present saving, and conse-
quent increase in profits for them;
but the future must be considered if
they expect to successfully remain in .
their old line of business.
It would show, too, that they were
overlooking the best interests of their
customers; and when they become so
selfish that they have little or no re-
gard for the welfare of others, espec-
ially those to whom they must look for
their own future success, it would
seem they must either expect to soon
be going out of business in their pres-
ent line, or that they considered their
customers a class who were not capa-
ble of appreciating fair treatment, or
were not shrewd enough to learn that
their confidence in them was being be-
trayed.
It has been said that "sometimes the
best way to make money is to spend
it well."
It is certainly as possible to econ-
omize to unprofitable extremes as it
is to lose by extravagance.
Selfishness is a weed, which thrives
most in the soil of narrow-minded-
ness.
The fruit of narrow-minded selfish-
ness was once impressively revealed to
me by an experience I had when a
boy on a farm: Father had begun
feeding his hogs for the Fall fatten-
ing, although they had not yet been
penned up and had liberty to pasture
in two adjoining fields The gate
through which they passed from one
field to the other was about midway
between the ends of the fence dividing
them, and about twenty rods from the
corner of the field in which the feed-
ing was done.
I threw out a feed of corn and call-
ed the hogs, which were browsing in
various places about the opposite field.
Each started for the feeding place—
some by way of the gate and, a few,
which were near the same side of the
field as the feeding-place, took a bee-


220
line course for it, coming up to the
corner, but, on the wrong side of the
fence.
There they stood, looking through
the fence and squealing while the oth-
ers had their meal, and they had their
appetites whetted. With their super-
abundance of greed and their narrow-
mindedness, they could not reason out
that the way to get at the object of
their desires was to first run away
from it.
In this regard they might be likened
to the manufacturers of machinery
who decline to make needed improve-
ments to their goods because to do so
would add a little to the initial cost.
Manufacturers of machinery who
take the initial steps in adopting time
and labor saving devices, or those of
greater efficiency, certainly deserve the
respect of the people who use them;
and, other conditions being equal, will
generally win and hold their patron-
age.
In a talk I had not long ago with a
man of over twenty years' successful
record as a machinery salesman and
collector in an extended district, he
told me there were a few, who, in pur-
chasing machinery, wanted something
cheap; the matter of quality not con-
cerning them materially so long as the
machine would do fairly satisfactory
work.
The majority, however, lie stated,
preferred the goods of better quality
and were willing to pay the difference
in cost to get them. It was necessary,
though, to make it clear to them
wherein the greater value lay.
He further stated that it was a
grave mistake for any to misrepresent
their goods, in any way, in order to
sell them; that honesty, and a square
deal, were the best policies. His
views, at least, corroborate my own.
In commercialism these policies are
not always followed. With it, too of-
ten, might is right; and under the
compelling circumstances of this or-
der of things, truth and merit fre-
quently go begging.
I have said that I believed in hon-
esty and the square deal; therefore,
in keeping with this policy, it be-
hooves me to admit here that what
has been said in the foregoing repre-
sents but one of the two sides of the
case—the dark side, as it may be ex-
pressed.
Looking at the case on the other
or bright side it must be admitted that
all progress that has been made—
which during the past fifty years has
heen truly mervellous—has been due
to commercialism that has aided in-
ventive genius.
Tt is better to be an optimist than
a pessimist, but it certainly is not in
keeping with optimism to overlook or
to cover up knowledge for commer-
cial reasons.


OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS IN
TWO VARIABLES
PROF. T. R. RUNNING
The following approximate solution of differential equations depends
upon the principle of areas. Simply stated the solution is derived from the
fact that the difference between any two ordinates of a curve is equal to the
area under the derived curve included between the corresponding ordinates.
Geometrically this is illustrated in figure i. The shaded areas are segments
of the integral and derived curves over the range included between x0, the
initial value of the independent variable, and x, some other value greater
than .r0. The chord of the arc must not be over one and one-half units or at
most two units: ordinarily a fractional part of a unit. If y — a is a small
angle, as will be explained later, the chord may be taken greater than a unit.
From figure I it is readily seen that the following equations are true:
y'dx — y — y.

x0 is the initial value of x and the subscript zero is used with y and its
derivations to indicate their corresponding values.
Suppose that we have a ditferential equation of the fifth order and
suppose that the integral and derived curves have the relation indicated in
figure i between the values of the independent variable x0 and x. Let An
stand for the area of the triangle formed by tangents at the extremities of
the arc and the chord of the curve dy"/dxn. The area of the segment will
be less than the area of the triangle provided the arc does not include a cusp
or a point of inflection. Let the ratio of the area of the segment to the area

equations hold:

The plus sign has been used before each term representing the area of a
segment, because, as will be seen later, the function which represents the
area of the triangle in each case will carry with it the proper sign.
If the different values of K and A were known we would have a set of
five equations together with the given differential equation from which the
values of y, y', y", y'", y"", and y""' could be computed. These values
would again form a new set of known values which could be used in exactly
the same way to determine another set corresponding to a selected value of
the independent variable. It is to be observed that the equations in set (1)
are linear in the unknown quantities.
The first step in the process of solution will then be to determine ex-
pressions for the values of K and A. From figure 2 the area of the triangle
represented bv Ax is equal to the right triangle ABD minus the right triangle

Consider the triangle A, in figure i. Since tan /? is less than tan a and
tan y less than tan /3 the expression representing its area is positive and
therefore A',-', will be positive. It is seen from the figure that the area of
the segment must be added to that of the trapezoid to make the first equa-
tion in set (1) true. In the case of A2 the conditions are different: tan o
is less than tan /? and tan y less than tan /?. The expression representing the
area of this segment will, therefore, be negative, and it is seen that the area


Fig. 3.


225
must be subtracted from that of the trapezoid in order that the second
equation of (1) may be true without discussing each of the expressions
representing the areas of the segments it is evident from what has been said
that the sign belonging to each of the second terms in the left hand members
of the equations of (1) is determined by the expressions themselves.
If the correct values of K and A could be obtained the exact numerical
values of y and its derivatives would be found by solving set (1) and the
given differential equation. In the nature of the case this is impossible for
their values, necessarily, depend upon the soultion of the differential equa-
tion. An approximate value K can, however, be obtained which will enable
us to find a close approximation to the solution of the differential equation.
For the purpose of obtaining an expression for K we will first find the
limit which K approaches as the arc of the segment approaches zero as a
limit in the curve

This expression becomes indeterminate as x2 approaches r.. Evaluat-
ing it we find that it approaches 2/3 as a limit, provided that is not zero.
If Xj is zero the value of the expression for all values of x2 is n/(»-f-i). The
conclusion to be drawn from this fact is that when the end of the arc is
located at a point of inflexion K must be taken as «/(n-f-i). For short arcs
and small values of y — a K taken as 2/3 will give fairly good results pro-
vided that at a point of inflexion the value be taken as }i. But as it is incon-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
venient to proceed by short steps it is far better to have an expression for K
which will yield good results for larger values of the arc and y — a.
A fairly close approximation to the value of K found by a rather tedious
process is
K = y3 + -r-
21550
where D = | y — o | in degrees and L is the length of the chord.
On account of the probability of error in computing K from this
formula it is desirable to replace it by a much simpler one and one which
will give nearly as good results. When y— a has a value from o° to io°
K may be taken equal to 2/3, and when y —a lies between 10° and 250 the
value may be taken equal to .67. In applying the above rule the chord should
not be over one and one-half units for the larger values of y — a.
In what follows it is assumed that an arc of the curve y = .rn can be
found which will fit closely any arc of the integral or derived curves under
consideration. For an arc whose extremity is located at a point of inflexion
the value of K must be determined in each case; that is, the best value of n
in the formula K = n/(n -f- 1). To avoid this determination of 11 it is safe to
assume that a short arc of y = x* extending from the point of inflexion
will fit the curve in which case K may be taken to be as stated above.
The separate steps in the computation are best set forth by an illustration.
Let us solve the equation of the second order
.r-y + xy" — (Xs + V2)y = o.
for values lying between x = 1 and .1—3. We start from a set of assumed
values corresponding to x = I
y = 1
y'=-5
The equation then gives us
y" = -75
y'" = —• 125
The solution of the above equation will make clear the steps necessary in
the solution of an equation of any order.
The computation for finding the values of y and its derivatives corres-
ing to x— 12 will be propounded in detail.

by substituting the value of 31 just found in equations (1) and (2) respect-

ively. y'" is obtained by substituting the above values in the equation
obtained by differentiating the given equation. These values are copied in
the table below.
The last two divisions of the table headed y' and y" refer to the first
and second derived curves respectively. The values of tan a, tan fi, and tan
y are taken from the first part of the table. In the part of the table headed
y' tan a is equal to the value of y" for x — i, tan y is equal to the value of
y" for x — 1.2, and tan p is obtained by taking the difference between the
two values of y' corresponding to x= i and ,r= 1.2 and dividing by 1/5.
The values of K used in the table were determined by the last method.
The equations for the second approximation are

Substituting these values in the differential equation we find that

y'&gt; y"&gt; and y'" are found as before.
For finding the values of y, y', y", and y'" corresponding to x = 1.5 the
above process is repeated.
In the sixth column the correct values of y to six decimal places are
given for the purpose of comparison.
In finding the values of y and its derivatives corresponding to x— 1.2
only two approximations were made, a third being unnecessary because the
two differed only slightly in the fourth place. For values corresponding to
x = 2 four approximations were made because the second and third differed
by three units in the fourth pace. For the same reason a fourth approxima-
tion should have been made in the last two steps. The results would have
been changed slightly in the fifth decimal place.


The committees representing Albion
College and the Engineering Depart-
ment of the University of Michigan
met at Albion College on October
17th, 1914, to discuss the final details
as to the arrangement of work in the
combined course, the principle of
which had already been sanctioned by
the Board of Regents of the Univer-
sity at their October meeting.
In general, it is proposed that a
student shall spend at least three
years at Albion College and two suc-
ceeding years at the University. At
the end of his first year's work at the
University, provided the reports are
satisfactory, he will receive the degree
of Bachelor of Arts from Albion Col-
leeg; the latter Institution being will-
ing to accept the work done at the
University as the equivalent for the
fourth year.
Upon the completion of the re-
quirements for graduation in the En-
gineering Department, the student
will receive the degree of Bachelor of
Science in Engineering.
The work performed at Albion Col-
lege will be of such character and ex-
tent as to enable the student on the
combined course to enter the third
year of the regular engineering
courses at the University. To accom-
plish this end certain work which nor-
mally comes in the third year in some
of the engineering courses, will be
given at Albion College in order that
the student may not be handicapped by
having to make up certain other
courses, facilities for the teaching of
which are not available at Albion Col-
lege, and which normally come in the
second year of the engineering course.
Tart of the shop requirements will be
made in Albion factories.
A schedule of work for the first
three years at Albion College is at-
tached hereto, and represents in gen-
eral the arrangement of work for the
various branches of engineering which
the combined committees recommend
for adoption.
In making the above schedule cer-
tain facts were kept in mind. Al-
though Albion College requires the
same number of units for entrance as
the University, it does not insist upon
Physics, Chemistry, or three units of
Mathematics (two only being requir-
ed). The result is that it is necessary
to devote sufficient time to these sub-
jects, so that the student, at the end
of his three years, will have covered
the work necessary to enable him to
enter the third year of the engineering
course. This encroaches somewhat
upon the time available for the more
general cultural courses, but it should
be borne in mind that in nearly all
cases the student will have presented
for entrance more work of this char-
acter than that required by the Engi-
neering Department.

HON. LAWTON T, HEMANS*
"Dean Cooley, with a sincere pur-
pose of compliment, has told you that
I was once the candidate of the Demo-
cratic party for Governor. That you
may draw no false conclusions, per-
haps I should tell you the whole truth,
—that I have been a candidate not
once, but twice; that running for Gov-
ernor has become somewhat of a hab-
it with me. Once upon a time in my
first campaign, at the conclusion of an
address a man came up to the plat-
form and put up a hand that indicated
its" possessor was familiar with physi-
cal toil, and said—"Mr. Hemans, I
want to shake your hand and tell you
that you will at least get every Demo-
cratic vote in my township. I am the
only gol durned Democrat there;"—
so you see running for Governor on
the Democratic ticket in Michigan
may indicate no quality greater than
courage in the candidate.
It is a matter of exceptional pleas-
ure to view so large a body of young
men and women on the threshold, so
to speak, of engineering careers, for
while most of us no doubt are looking
forward to the financial and material
rewards that are to come from pro-
fessional effort, there is another side
which to my mind is of equal, if not
greater import, both to you as individ-
uals and to society as a whole.
It is a matter of frequent comment
that this is an age of wonderful devel-
opment, but in no field is it more true
than in the field of the so-called public
utility. Our great railway systems,
illuminating gas from destructive dis-
tillation, water under pressure, light,
heat and power from electric energy,
♦Chairman of Michigan Railroad Commis-
sion.
the telephone and the telegraph are
the product of the inventive genius of
Httle more than a life-time. The pub-
lic utility has almost transformed our
civilization and has become one of the
greatest of our social and economic
problems.
With the introduction of the first
utilities, nothing was more natural
than that they should have been left
to the individual creation and control
of the interests which promoted them,
but society very soon learned that the
business of the utility, whether it was
in the furnishing of transportation, in
the transmission of intelligence, or in
the furnishing of water, light, heat
and power, had characteristics which
made it fundamentally different from
the ordinary business, which individ-
uals had prosecuted for all the cen-
turies of the past. In the business of
the ordinary merchant there is an ap-
peal to a variety of tastes and the fi-
nancial ability of the purchaser, which
invite competition. This is a charac-
teristic wholly lacking in the product
of the public utility. The very nature
of the service which public utilities
render removes them from the field
where efficiency and economic consid-
erations are promoted by competition.
In other words, public utilities are nat-
ural monopolies. Because they are
monopolies serving the public, they
cannot safely be entrusted to private
control. We have then the two alter-
natives: Governmental or political
ownership and control, — or private
ownership and governmental super-
vision and control. The issue be-
tween these two systems is of tre-
mendous importance.
The Michigan Railroad Commis-
sion, as you know, passes upon the


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
stock and bond issues of all public ser-
vice corporations. During the past
four years, for the public utilities of
the state, and for the railways that
cross its borders, it has authorized
stock and bonds to the amount of be-
tween six and seven hundred millions.
This enormous sum is needed simply
to keep pace with the growth of our
commonwealth. Shall the institutions
which expend these vast sums become
a part of our political machinery, or
shall they be left as a part of indus-
trial activities of society, with unre-
stricted power in government to inves-
tigate, regulate and control?
It seems to me that before govern-
mental ownership and control can be
effectively urged, it must be demon-
strated that political activities are su-
perior to those found in the business
world. They should show that our
cities are run more efficiently and eco-
nomically than our vast industrial in-
stitutions, which is notoriously not the
case. We all know that the power to
successfully manage and administer is
superior to the power to create.
There are a thousand men who have
the power to conceive an enterprise,
where there is one that has the abil-
ity to conduct it to successful issue.
We cannot have the impetus of indi-
vidual desire to achieve in the lines of
public utility, if as soon as the utility
is created it is to become a function
of government, and we have not come
to the end of our public utility crea-
tions.
Our own government was founded
on the idea of developing the individ-
uality of each citizen, providing the
greatest scope for the exercise of his
abilities and powers.
All of these considerations point to
private ownership and governmental
control as the solution of the great
problem of the public utility. It gives
free exercise to the individual intia-
tive. It restricts opportunity only by
the ability of he who survives. It
gives the public the benefit of the su-
perior thrift, energy and capacity of
individual business, while it preserves
to the public the power to regulate,
restrict and supervise, necessary to
protect the public interest.
But efficient supervision and control
necessitates thorough and exact
knowledge, and it is here that society
looks to the men of the profession up-
on which you have entered. That the
regulating body may properly pre-
scribe the rate of return and the qual-
ity of service, it must have extensive
knowledge as to original cost, as to de-
preciation, current maintenance, as
well as many other elements that en-
ter into a proper adjustment of the
rate. Many of these elements are
still unknown with anything like defi-
niteness by even the men who pro-
mote the enterprise.
So large a body of young men and
women as I see here before me must
be an important factor in the solving
of the problems presented and it is
here that your greatest work is to be
accomplished. You will go from here
to achieve the material and financial
successes that are always an impor-
tant consideration, but the greater suc-
cess will be in the service which you
will contribute to society and to gov-
ernment through high, lofty and disin-
terested effort in the solution of one of
this state and nation's greatest prob-
lems. With these things in mind I can-
not do otherwise than congratulate
you upon the auspicious field that lies
before you.
Perhaps I should say to you in con-
clusion that this is a very happy day
to me individually,—for fifty years
ago today two very important events
occurred, — Abraham Lincoln was
elected to the Presidency, and I was
born.


PROF. J. R. ALLEN
The spring trip for the Mechanical
engineers was originality planned by
Dean M. E. Cooley and was first taken
in 1888. Since that time similar trips
have been taken almost every year. In
recent years, however, the real pur-
pose of the trip seems to have been
lost sight of. The trip was primarily
planned for students in their junior
year so that they might better appre-
ciate the work of the senior year. It
is not until the senior year that the
students come into contact with the
more practical side of engineering.
Most students are lacking in sufficient
knowledge of manufacturing process-
es and of the operations of the great
factories and power houses. The in-
tention of the trip is to supply this
lack of information and to give the
students a better appreciation of what
our great manufacturing institutions
are and what their future place in
these institutions may be.
The trips are so arranged that the
students visit as many different man-
ufacturing operations as possible and
as many different typical power houses
as it is possible to do in the limited
time. The experience of students who
have taken the trip in former years
has shown that these trips are ex-
tremely valuable and materially help
the student in his senior year to prop-
erly comprehend his work. In fact,
the trip is one never to be forgotten
as the student is enabled to visit many
of the manufacturing establishments
that would be impossible were he to
attempt to obtain permission to see
them alone. In order to obtain per-
mission to go through some of the es-
tablishments visited it is necessary to
have the action of the board of direc-
tion of the company as these plants
are equipped with special apparatus
and have special processes to which
the public are not generally admitted.
Many students have said after taking
this trip that they felt the benefit de-
rived from the trip was equal to at
least three months' work in college.
It is strongly urged that all members
of the Junior Mechanical Engineering
class should, if possible, arrange to
take this trip during the spring vaca-
tion.

Our "Swan Song.''
It is with regret that the present
board takes up the publication of this
issue of the Michigan Technic, as
it means that, with this one, the con-
trol will pass out of their hands into
those of the new board. It is, never-
theless, not given up without a certain
feeling of satisfaction, as many things
have been accomplished during the
regime of the present board. When
the control of the Technic was turn-
ed over to it. things were in a bad
way, and, at the suggestion of the
board, the Engineering Society ap-
pointed a committee to investigate and
report on the best plan for putting the
Michigan Technic on the basis
which it deserves. Through this in-
vestigation, which is discussed at
length on another page of this issue,
the Technic came to its own, and
has enjoyed a more active existence
than at any time in the previous four
or five years.
For the first time in that period, the
paper has been put on a satisfactory
financial hasis; not what it could be,
but better than it has been in the past.
With the proper continuation of the
policy established by the present
board, through the cooperation of the
Engineering Society, and earnest en-
deavor on the part of the members of
the new board, the Michigan Tech-
nic can be put on a firm basis, where
it may properly uphold the honor and
dignity of the University which it rep-
resents. This cannot be done in a
year, or two years, but is the ultimate
goal which is to be attained. It will
never be attained by letting the inter-
est now aroused die out, but only will
it be attained by the earnest efforts of
each succeeding board to improve on
the work of the last one. All success
to the new Board!
New Technic Offices.
We announce with pleasure that we
have removed our offices from the
Old Engineering Building, where the
Technic has been for many years, into
the Engineering Society Rooms, in
the New Engineering Building. Thf
new offices are far more convenient
and better arranged, and an improve-
ment in the work of the staff has al-
ready been noticed.
Elective Courses.
It is common to hear, on all sides,
the expression of the student to the
effect that he has worked hard for
three years, and has only 17 hours to
get off to graduate, and he is going to
slack off and take it easy for a year.
Such a proceeding seems to be a veri-
table anti-climax to the culmination of
the student's college course. At the
very time when he is best prepared to
study advanced courses with excel-
lent professors, leaders in their respec-
tive lines; when he has all of his fund-
amentals thoroughly in mind; when
he has no worldly cares to prey on
him; and, most important of all, when
he has time and opportunity to study
these advanced courses, he sluffs on
the job and lets opportunity knock un-
noticed. Such actions on the part of
the student show a lack of the deter-
mination to win; the determination
which is so essential to success in the
unfeeling world. Such actions show
a tendency toward laziness and sloth-
fulness, either of which will effectually
ruin a man in short time.
The senior year is the year of col-
lege years. It is at that time that the


young engineer is preparing to enter
in on his life work. His success in
that life will depend, to a great ex-
tent, on his training in college. The
more he knows about a certain sub-
ject, or several subjects, the better
will be his chances for that success
for which we all hope. His Senior
year is the time to get those courses.
Realize that it is the knock of Oppor-
tunity, and do not let it go unans-
wered.
Keeping A File.
There comes a time, sooner or later,
in the life of every Engineer, when
he remembers having read a certain
article at some previous time, but he
cannot place it, or does know how to
look it up. Or he has in mind cer-
tain valuable data on a problem on
which he may be working, but has no
trace of its whereabouts. At such
times the Engineer has the greatest
need of a file of some sort for keep-
ing articles, data, photographs, charts,
etc., anything that he may have future
use for.
There is any number of systems
of filing and indexing articles, and
almost any of these may be followed
out with advantage. It is essential
to pick out a system which will ex-
pand without congestion, as a system,
in confusion, is worse than useless.
Where possible, it is desirable to keep
files of the complete magazines, with
indices on the articles desired. Where
this is impossible or undesirable, the
particular articles or sheets may be slit
out with a knife, and filed in cases of
some sort. This latter system has the
advantage that any articles bearing on
a certain subject may be removed and
readily carried about on a project.
The time to begin a file is when a
man begins to read articles with in-
terest and wish that he had some way
to keep track of them. A little time
spent in the development of some
system for keeping such articles is well
spent, and will be appreciated more
and more as the years roll by.
Engineering Opportunities.
With each succeeding report of the
war, with its tale of destruction and
slaughter, comes the need of Engi-
neers will be called on to assist in the
of Europe. When the war comes to an
end, as it is hoped it will in the near
future, the greatest part of the re-
building of the once ultra-civilized
nations will be played by Engineers.
Many of the greatest foreign Engi-
neers are being sacrificed in the car-
nage of battle, and American Engi-
neers to rebuild the shattered empires
work of reconstruction.
Automobile Manufacture has been
cut to practically nothing in Europe;
many of the finest French and Ger-
man factories have been destroyed,
and many more will be destroyed be-
fore the termination of the war. This
means that American manufacturers
will have to design and manufacture
cars for the world until Europe can
get on her feet again.
All other branches of Engineering
will have their parts to play in this
work of rebuilding, and as a conse-
quence, a vast field is to be soon open-
ed to the Engineering graduates of the
next ten years or more.
Engineeresses.
A new refining element has been
gradually creeping into the Engineer-
ing Department within the last few
years. Reference is made to the ever
increasing number of young ladies
who are taking up the study of En-
gineering. A few years ago it was
not unusual to have two young ladies
in the engineering classes, but last


237
year there were six and this year thir-
teen!
The young ladies have been making
good, too, as examination of the roll
of class officers of the Sophomore and
Freshman classes will show. One of
them is Vice-President of the Sopho-
more class, and another is Secretary
of the Freshman class. They are up-
holding their end of the scholarship
standards, also, and are not proving
a drag on the classes in any way, as
many have imagined. Two of the
young ladies have set a good example
for the rest in joining the Engineer-
ing society, and have thus signified
their intention of helping out the En-
gineering Department in its inside
work.
The girl who is not afraid of the
hard, uncasing toil of the Engineer,
who is willing to soil her dainty hands
in the attainment of an engineering
education, who is anxious to take such
an active part in the upbuilding of the
material world, deserves nothing but
the highest respect and consideration
of the Men in the Engineering De-
partment.
Here's to the Girl Engineer!


MICHIGAN ENGINEERING SOCIETY.
The annual meeting of the Michigan En-
gineering Society is to be held in Ann Ar-
bor on January 19th, 20th, and 21st. The
official headquarters during the convention
will be the rooms of the Engineering So-
ciety, located in the New Engineerng Build-
ing.
The Michigan Engineering Society is an
organization which deserves especial men-
tion, on account of the affiliations which it
has had with the faculty members of this
University. It was founded in the early
days before the present National Engineer-
ing Societies had grown to their present
size, and for that reason, contains in its list
of members, some of the most prominent
engineers in this country. Dean M. E.
Cooley was one of the founders, and is also
a past President of the organization.
Among the other past presidents are also:
Professors J. R. Allen, J. B. Davis, H. E.
Riggs. and Chas. E. Greene. The present
President is J. J. Cox, of the Highway
Engineering Department of the University.
Mr. S. J. Hoexter, of the Mechanical En-
gincring facuty, is Secretary. The society
was originally composed of surveyors and
county engineers, but now includes in its
membership the most prominent engineers
of all classes.
Through Mr. S. J Hoexter, the Michigan
Fnginecring Society extends an invitation
to all members of the Engineering Society
to attend its meetings, at which many in-
teresting papers will be presented. There
will be a banquet at the Union during the
stay of the visitors, 200 of whom are now
expected to come. The co-operation of all
members of the Engineering Society of the
University is requested in making the stay
of the visitors as pleasant as possible.
RESEARCH.
Further I investigations by PRor. Zowski.
In his work to improve the water tur-
bines for low heads, aiming to raise both
the speed power values and the efficiency.
Prof. Zowski has made further progress.
This latest high speed, high capacity wheel
exceeded the power of his last wheel, No.
5, by 25%, maintaining the same speed
and raising the efficiency from 50.1% to
90.7%.
Wheel No. 5 had, under a 1 ft. head, a
power of 3.31 with a speed of 50 R. P. M.
and an efficiency of 90.1%—giving a "type
characteristic" of 91. This new wheel
develops under 1 ft. head a power of 4.17
with a speed of 50 R. P. M. and an ef-
ficiency of 90.7%—giving a "type character-
istic" of 102.
It was generally believed by turbine
theorists and designers that to attempt to
design water wheels for "type character-
istics" greater than 75 to 80, which means
power values of 2.2.5 to 2.56 at a speed
of 50 R. P. M. under 1 ft. head, would
make the wheel entirely uncommercial. The
work of Prof. Zowski disproves this theory.
Wheel Tests.
A series of tests has been conducted in
the experimental laboratories of the Uni-
versity of Michigan by Asst. Prof. F. N.
Menefee. to determine the Comparative
Strengths of Steel, Wire and Wood
wheels.
The wheels were tested in a Riehle
machine with the support at the hub and
the load applied at the rim. The load was
applied in 500 tb. increments and the per-
manent deflection or set measured after
each increment.
Following is a tabulated statement of
deflections and loads:—

The wood wheel failed at 4,500 pounds; two
spokes in the wire wheel broke at 4,000
pounds, though no nipples pulled through
the rim.
Hot Air Furnaces.
Assistant Professor J. E. Emswiler, in
his course M. E. 22, Assisted by Wyeth
Allen, M. N. Smalley and E. J. Kruszka,
Senior Mechanicals, has been conducting
a series of experiments on Round Oak hot
air furnaces. Not much experimental work
has ever been done on hot air furnaces, as
the difficulties are so much greater than
in the case of steam and hot water. The
experiments are for the purpose of deter-
mining three things; 1st, the velocity of air
as it goes thru a hot air furnace; 2nd, the
coefficient of transmission of heat from the
heating surfaces of furnaces; and 3rd, the
efficiency of a hot air fnrnace.
Compressed Air.
Professor Emswiler is running a test to
determine the coefficient of discharge of an
orifice that can be placed in a pipe line
carrying compressed air. The orifice is
used with quite a low difference of pres-
sure on the two sides. In this experiment,
the Ingersoll-Rand Company, of Painted
Post, X. Y., manufacturers of compressed
air machinery, have sent a low pressure
orifice box to facilitate measurements. E. J.
Smith, H. S. Parsons and E. T. Thomas,
are the senior mechanicals assisting.
The Disposal of Tannery Wastes.
Mr. Albert Roth, who was graduated
from the department of Civil Engineering
last June, spent the summer vacation as
Assistant Engineer in the Engineering Divi-
sion of the State Board of Health. During
the greater part of the summer he was
engaged upon a study of tannery wastes,
particularly in relation to city water sup-
plies and the pollution of streams, but with
the opening of college he entered the Uni-
versity for a year of graduate study in
Sanitary Engineering and is now continu-
ing his investigation of the purification of
industrial wastes important in Michigan,
particularly those from tanneries.
In connection with this investigation he
made a trip into western Pennsylvania in
October, following which he read a paper
in Chicago before the annual meeting of
the American Association of Leather Chem-
ists on the subject, "The Disposal of Sew-
age Wastes from Tanneries."
In this paper Mr. Roth showed that with
the increasing demands for the protection
of city water supplies from contamination
and of all streams from injurious pollu-
tion, the tanning industry was being forced
to meet a most serious and difficult prob-
lem. The liquid wastes from a tannery are
large in volume and are extremely difficult
to handle. So little is known regarding
effective and economic means of disposing
of wastes of this character that several
tanneries, after making ineffectual attempts
to reach a satisfactory solution of the
problem of taking care of their waste pro-
ducts, have been forced to go out of busi-
ness. A large amount of money has been
spent on disposal plants, many of which
are valueless and most are very far from
being satisfactory. In his paper Mr. Roth
was able to point clearly to certain funda-
mental principles upon which the economic
design of purification plants for the dis-
posal of tannery wastes must be based.
Marine Tank.
Prof. Sadler is at present investigating
the question of ships' wakes by means of
current meters. The meters are run with
no model in front of them and then later
with a model in front. The difference in
revolutions gives the velocity of the water
following the model.
A report on Experimental Towboats has
been made by a board of Army Engineers
and is contained in House Document No.
857. 63rd Congress, 2nd Session. The tests
upon tow-boats and barge forms and upon
radial and feathering paddle wheels were
made in the experimental tank of the Uni-
versity under Prof. Sadler's direction.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
FACULTY.
Appraisal Work.
The Pere Marquette Appraisal, which
has heen conducted by Dean Cooley with
the assistance of Professor Riggs and Pro-
fessor Anderson and many of the Engineer-
ing faculty and Alumni, is nearing com-
pletion. The preliminary report has been
in several weeks and the final report will
have reached the State Railroad Commis-
sion by the first of December.
The D. U. R. Appraisal of which Dean
Cooley is also the head, is at this time over
half finished. This Appraisal includes not
only the Detroit City Lines but also all the
Interurban lines owned by the D. U. R. in
Michigan.
Designs Power Plant.
Professor John R. Allen is acting as Con-
sulting Engineer for the Idaho Oregon
Light and Power Company, installing a
temporary installation at the Oxbow Bend
Power House on the Snake River, Idaho.
The silent chain drive used is the largest
in the world. Two waterwheels are hitched
to each generator and 5,000 horsepower are
developed.
Sanitary System For Camp-Davis.
A. N. Laird, Teaching Assistant in Sur-
veying, is designing a sanitary system for
Camp Davis. The plans include a septic
tank and a sub-surface irrigation system.
MICHIGAN MEX IX THE PRESS.
Automobilk Wheel Tests.
In ths "Motor World'' of April 9, 1914,
appeared an article concerning the tests
conducted by Asst. Prof. F. XT. Menefee of
the Engineering Department. The tests
covered strengths of wooden and wire
wheels under various conditions. Articles
on the E-ame subject apeparcd also in "The
Automobile" of April 9. 1914. and in "The
Scientific American.''
Professor Menefee has lately been con-
ducting a series of sewer-pipe tests for the
Consolidated Coal Company of Saginaw.
The object of the tests was to obtain a
comparison of the strength of concrete pipe
and double strength vitrified pipe.
New Faculty Members.
In ihe Engineering Mechanics Depart-
ment, O. W. Boston has been raised to the
position of instructor. Mr. Boston grad-
uated in 1913.
The Surveying Department has taken A.
N. Laird and C. N. Ward on the roll of
Teaching Assistants. Both men are of the
class of 1914.
Descriptive Geometry is now being taught
by several men from other schools. They
are: M. J. Orbeck. from the U. of Minne-
sota; F A. Mickle, from Ohio State; and
J. C. Palmer from the U. of Illinois.
Student assistants in the E. E. Dept. are
G. B. Stuart, Grad. School; E. D. King
'IS. and L. E. Delf, '15.
NEW BOOKS BY MICHIGAN MEN.
Heat Engines.
J. R. Allen and J. A. Bursley.
Professor John R. Allen and Professor
Joseph A. Bursley, of the Mechanical Engi-
neering Department, realizing the advance-
ment made in various types of heat en-
gines during the past few years, have pub-
lished a new edition of their treatise on
Heat Engines.
The book is being handled by the Mc-
Graw-Hill Book Company and is meeting
with wonderful success as a college text-
book, being used in twenty some engineer-
ing schools.
Among the new subjects treated are the
Stumf Uniflow Engine, the Humphrey Gas
Pump and recent developments in boilers,
stokers, steam turbines and gas engines.
Many of the chapters have been rewritten
and detailed explanation added which in-
crease the value of the book as a text, and
at the same time make it a valuable addi-
tion to any engineering library.

A New Book on Electrical Measure-
ments.
A. W. Smith.
For the past ten years the subject of
Electrical Measurements has been taught
by Professor A. W. Smith, of the Depart-
ment of Physics, (luring which time there
has accumulated a system of notes cover-
ing the entire subject, and giving the best
methods for class-room presentation. These
notes have now appeared in the form of a
book entitled "Principles of Electrical
Measurements," which is being successfully
used this semester.
Following out the author's practice of
teaching simple things first, the book be-
gins with a series of experiments in which
the fundamental principles of the subject
are emphasized and illustrated by the use of
only the simplest apparatus in order to
keep the attention of the experimentator on
the principles involved rather than on the
apparatus. Having established this founda-
tion, the succeeding chapters take up in
more detail the exact measurement of re-
sistance, current, electromotive force,
power, capacity, inductance magnetisation
of iron, and the first notions of alternating
currents, giving the complete theory in
each case and explaining the best methods
to be used. The calibration of electrical
instruments forms an important section of
the book, and the location of faults on a
telephone line always convinces the class
that electrical measurements are "practical."
The treatment of the Magnetic Circuit is
unique and fundamental, and gives io the
student of electrical engineering a sane and
logical basis for the further study of elec-
trical machinery.
The publishers. McGraw-Hill Book Co.,
have produced an attractive volume, and
their enterprise is shown by the fact that
although the proof was read after the close
of the Summer Session, the finished book
was in the hands of the students the first
day of this semester.
Low Head Water Wheels.
S. J. Zowski.
In the Engineering Record for November
28, there appeared an article by Professor
Zowski in which he discussed the recent
developments and improvements in the de-
sign of water wheels for low heads. As
the article was written before the tests
were made on his latest wheel, this wheel
was not mentioned.
DEPARTMENTAL CLASSES.
Senior Class.
Early in the year the Senior Engineers
elected the following class officers and
managers:
President—O. W. Hall.
Vice-President—J. W. Raynsford.
Secretary—J. H. Bateman.
Treasurer—D. G. Ellis.
Football Manager—W. W. Candler.
Baseball Manager—W. H. Stewart.
Track Manager—J. H. Ferris.
Baseball Manager—A. R. Griffes.
Committees have been appointed to take
charge of the various class duties and the
full list of chairmen and committees will
appear in the next issue.
The Social Committee, of which Frank
Sheehy is chairman, has planned a dance,
to be held in the near future. A Combina-
tion Senior Engineer-Senior Lit dance is
receiving consideration.
The Union dinner committee, presided
over by Art Griffes, held a very successful
dinner at the Union, Tuesday, December I.
These are planned for every month and
original features will mark each dinner.
The question of Senior Assembly is be-
ing discussed and a decision will probably
be reached in the near future. Until this
arrangement, speakers will be invited to all
assemblies, giving the class an opportunity
to hear some of the big men of the day.
Junior Engineers.
The Junior Engineers elected the follow-
ing class officers:
President—Don Smith, Algonac.
Vice-President—Harry Buell, Saginaw.
Secretary—Howard Phillips, Ann Arbor.
Treasurer—Bob Hadley, Toledo, Ohio.
Basketball Mgr.—Walt. Reichle, Saginaw.
Track 'Manager—Jack Carritte, Detroit.
Baseball Manager—T. D. Weaver, De-
troit.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
A strong social committee was appointed
and their ability was proven Friday evening,
November 20, when the most successful
smoker in the history of the class was held
at the Union.
Francis Mack acted as toastmaster. Pro-
fessor Allen, the faculty speaker, told of
some of his early engineering experiences.
Dad Ricketts talked about the Student
Council, explaining its functions and its
relation to the student body. President
Smith gave an "Oration"; Clesson Bush-
nell, '15, sang a song; Scanlon, '16L, per-
formed at the piano and sprung some orig-
inal stuff, and Russell Mills led the Mando-
lin Raggers Quartet.
The first dance of the season, "The
Mechanics' Ball,'' was held at the Union,
December 4. It upheld the reputaion made
by the "'16" Engineers in their Freshman
and Sophomore years for giving the best
class dances on the Campus.
The President and Social Committee of
the class are working hard to get a J. Hop
this year. A Junior Hop, under class man-
agement and minus the expensive and ob-
jectionable features of past years, is a cam-
pus institution that should be perpetuated.
Sophomore Class.
The following officers were elected by
the class at a meeting held early in the
year:
President—Geo. A. Scheibel.
Vice-President—Dorothy T. Hanchett.
Secretary'—Thatcher W. Rea.
Treasurer—Louis F. Dieterich.
Football Mgr.—Edwin K. Marshall.
Baseball Mgr.—H. H. Whittingham.
Track Mgr.—H. L. Carroll.
Basketball Mgr.—Willis Brodhcad.
Scrgeant-at-Arms—E. N. Kendall.
Xo definite plans of the Sophomores
could be obtained at time of going to
press.
Freshman Class.
The following officers for the 1918 Engi-
neer class were elected Wednesday, Octo-
ber twenty-first, in the Freshman Assem-
bly:
President—Henry F. Dake.
Vice-President—E. I. Craig.
Secretary—Miss Dorothy Hall.
Treasurer—C. C. Smith.
Football Mgr.—Phil Raymond.
Track Mgr.—M. McKec.
Basketball Mgr.—F. R. Brown.
Baseball Mgr.—H. S. Knowlson
No definite plans for the year have been
made.
Class Assemblies.
Last year at the request of the second
and third year men the mentor and assem-
bly system was extended to sophomores
and juniors so that these classes might have
monthly assemblies for class meetings and
monthly reports on their studies through
their mentors. The number in each group
was so large, however, that the mentors
were unable to give individual attention to
their men and the number of men in a
group has this year been reduced to twen-
ty for sophomores and twenty-five for ju-
niors. The mentors for these classes are
assigned with reference to the branch of
engineering which the student has elected
in order that he may have an advisor in
his special field. With this exception, how-
ever, the ideal relations between mentor
and student are essentially the same, the
mentor being in the words of the Dean
"not merely an advisor about studies but
an elder brother whose business it is to see
that every man in his group gets the largest
possible benefit out of his college life."
SOCIETIES.
The Engineer'ng Society.
At recent meetings of the branches of
the Engineering Society the following offi-
cers were elected:
Chemical Branch:—
President—J. T. Naylon.
Vice-President—J. R. Roberts.
Scc.-Treas.—C. C. Kennedy.
Civil Branch:—
President—A. T. Ricketts.
Secretary—H. G. Frussing.
Treasurer—R F. Watt.


243
Student Branch A. I. E. E.:—
President—H. A. Enos.
Vice-President—E. D. King.
Secretary—H. W. Stubbs.
Treasurer—W. C. Weilbacher.
Student Branch A. S. M E.:—
President—R. H. Mills.
Sec.-Treas.—C. H. McClellan.
Combined Societies:—
Sec.-Treas.—M. S. Reed.
Librarian—H. B. Bartholf.
All of the branches report active pro-
gress, and are getting plans under way for
increasing membership in their branches.
They have all held meetings, at which
prominent men have spoken to the mem-
bers, and during October, all united in a
smoker in the Society rooms, where a pleas-
ant evening was spent in getting acquainted
and laying plans for the future.
Not ii: the past five years has the So-
ciety shown the active interest that it has
this year, and it is believed that the new
plan of reorganization is to be a success,
in that it promotes the interests of the
separate societies, both individually and col-
lectively.
Sigma Xi.
The Society of Sigma Xi elected last
June, ten undergraduates, eight of whom
were engineers: Edmond W. Conover,
Withred Cook, Gerhard Louis Luebblers,
Floyd Lyddon Moon, Albert Roth, Chester
Schoepfle, and Byron H. Stuch. The grad-
uates chosen were: Herbert John Cutler,
Carl Louis Schuman. James Wightman
Follin, and Chester Owen Wister.
Tau Beta Pi.
The following men of the 1915 Engineer-
ing Class were chosen to membership in
Tau Beta Pi, the National Engineering
Honorary Fraternity. Membership in this
Fraternity is based upon scholarship pri-
marily, and then consideration is taken of
the man's general all around characteristics
in his classes and on the campus. All se-
lections are made from the highest one-
&lt;|uarter of the class. The men selected
were:
Wyeth Allen, Hood River, Oregon.
Harold E. Wheeler, Chicago, 111.
Hershel C. Smith, Phoenix, Arizona.
Edward R. Young, Toledo. Ohio.
Hermann G. Mueller, Mt. Clemens, Mich.
Peter Tazelaar, Kalamazoo, Mich.
Clarke R. Greene, Salem, Ohio.
Ira H. Reindel, Detroit, Mich.
Norman S. Flook, Dunkirk, N. Y.
Ralph B. Dibble. Ann Arbor, Mich.
C. Hjalmer Flink, Ironwood, Mich.
The initiation was held on December 2nd,
after which a banquet was served the new
members and the faculty.
Phi Lambda Upsilo.v.
The following men were elected to mem-
bership in Phi Lambda Upsilon, the Hon-
orary Chemical Society, and initiated this
Fall:
H. A. Depew. E. H. Woodhouse, J. R.
Dean, H. F. Wood, E. R. Young, P. L.
Miller, N. A. Sanger and E. A. Rykenhoer.
Vulcans.
At the Fall election of Vulcans, the Sen-
ior Honorary Engineering Society, the fol-
lowing men were chosen to membership:
H. C. Smith, T. H. Bushnell, J. C. Abbott,
J. H. Ferris, G. D. Douglas, L. F. Terry,
H. L. Bockstahler. D. G. Ellis, W. T. Smith,
W. W. Candler, and W. W. Calkins.
The initiation and banquet were held on
October 28th, 1014. At the banquet F. W.
Sheehy acted as toastmaster. and the fol-
lowing me"n responded to toasts: Prof. H.
C. Sadler, Prof. A. J. Decker. Prof. Gard-
ner S. Williams, A. R. Griffes, and J. C.
Abbott.
Triangles.
Triangles, Junior Honorary Engineering
Society, initiated ten men on November
4th. They are: John Carritte, Norman
James, and Wallace Reid of Detroit; Har-
ry Bucll of Saginaw; John Norton of On-
tonagon; Walter Sterling of Negaunee;
Thomas Trelfa of Alpena; Francis Mack
of Toledo, Ohio; Macdonald Reed of Erie,
Pa.; and Harold J. Smith of Wilmette,
Ohio.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Professor A. E. White of the Chemical
Engineering Department and Professor H.
E. Riggs of the Civl Engineering Depart-
ment spoke at their initiation banquet at
the Michigan Union.
QUARTERDECK.
Nine Upper Class Marine Engineers were
initiated into Quarterdeck November 20,
1914. Part of the ceremony consisted in
parading the initiates about the campus—
clad in sailor suits and bearing oars.
Those selected were: J. Silverman, '15E;
A O. Adams, C. H. Sung, '15E; C.
Williams, '15E; W. C. Cook, '16E; N. L.
Goldstein, '16E; L. McCarthey, '16E; C. L.
Mattison, '16E; J. S. Bibber, '16E.
"Jimmie" Raynsford, '15E
Captain of the 1914 Varsity Football Squad
ENGINEERS WIN MONOGRAMS.
Five engineers were among the sixteen
men who won football M's this fall. Cap-
tain James Raynsford, 'ijE, of Detroit;
Earnest Hughitt, '15E, of Escanaba; Ice-
land H. Benton, '16E, of Valparaiso, Ind.;
John J. Lyons, '16E, of Pittsburg; and
Thomas II. Bushnell, '15E, of Cleveland,
Ohio.
The awards are made on the basis of
service to the team. Faithfulness in prac-
tice, and spirit on and off the field are all
considered.
R's were awarded to thirty players, an
unusually large number on account of the
strenuous season. Eight were engineers:
Floyd C. Morse, '15E; Edward J. DePree,
'15E; E. W. Miller, '15E; John K. Norton,
'16E; Robert F. Kohr, '17E; Clarence O.
Skinner, '17E; James L. Whalen, '17E;
and Samuel Cohen, '17E.

the department enrollment.
The enrollment in the Engineering De-
partment this year has been particularly
gratifying to the officers. On account of
the war and the consequent scarcity of
money in the United States, it was feared
that many prospective students would be
unable to enter and old students return.
According to Assistant Dean Butts, how-
ever, not many more than the usual num-
ber of those who had been admitted, have
failed to appear at the opening of college.
Of those who responded to a letter of en-
quiry, seventeen gave a lack of funds as
the reason for their non-attendance. Nine-
teen had entered other universities, prin-
cipally to be nearer home or for a slight
saving in fees. Thirteen gave general rea-
sons for their non-attendance and twelve
gave no reason at all.
On the whole, then, the war has not made
such a difference in attendance as it has
perhaps affected the expenditures of those
who did come.
The folowing table shows the compara-
tive enrollment by departments:

ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING.
The following changes in the Electrical
Engineering Course have been ratified by
the faculty:
1st. E. E. 2 is put in the first semester
of the junior year in place of electives,
putting E. E. 3 and E. E. 4 one semester
ahead of their previous locations.
2nd. E. E. 12 (transmission course) is
increased from 2 to 3 hours.
3rd. Hydromechanics (2 hours) is here-
after required of electrical engineering stu-
dents, to precede E. E. 11 (generating sta-
tions).
The increasing popularity of the electri-
cal engineering course at Michigan is
shown by the statistics of Sophomores
electing E. E. in the last three years:

MECHANICAL ENGINEERING.
Mr. S. R. Thomas, Teaching Assistant in
the Mechanical Engineering Department,
was married to Miss Claribelle Armitage,
'il, of Highland Park, Mich., on August
21, 1914.
As a member of the Society of Auto-
mobile Engineers Asst. Professor Fishleigh
has received a request for tests on proper
tap drill sizes and for experimental work
leading to the development of a formula
for destructive effect of vehicles on roads.
Asst. Professor W. T. Fishleigh of the
Mechanical Engineering Department acted
as expert last summer in the patent in-
fringement suit brought by W. S. Austin
against the Cadillac Motor Car Co. of De-
troit. The case was tried in the United
States District Court in Grand Rapids but
as yet no decision has been rendered.
ARCHITECTURAL DEPARTMENT.
The S. S. Kresge Company has just pre-
sented to the Department of Architecture
a beautiful plaster model of the new
Kresge building. This building is 18 stories
in height and stands on Adams Avenue
West, Detroit. The model is about four
feet high and is made at a scale of one-
quarter inch to the foot. It is an exquisite
piece of workmanship by Siebert &amp; Com-
pany of Detroit. The architect is Albert
Kahn and Ernest Wilby, Associate of De-
troit. The mode! is valued at about $500.
From a teaching point of view this model
will be most helpful since it illustrates,
thorough going modern design in an office
building of to-day. The design is very-
simple and direct; there is a large amount


247
of glass in proportion to the structural
frame. The steel frame is clothed with
dull-glazed white terra cotta which is well
simulated by the white plaster of the model.
In this design the conventional cornice,
which has little or no significance on a
building of this type, has been omitted and
is replaced by flat decorative bands which
are in harmony with the rest of the design
and in keeping with the character of the
material. The long vertical lines in the
facade clearly mark the structural frame
work. The skillful handling of the design
makes it possible to introduce large plate
glass windows in the lower two stories of
the building without giving the upper part
of the design the appearance of over load-
ing the lower portion.
It is proposed to color certain minor
portions of the building so as to further
approximate the actual effect of the build-
ing as it now stands in Detroit.
The generous gift of the Kresge Com-
pany constitutes the most important thus
far received by the Department of Archi-
tecture. It forms a most important addi-
tion to the equipment of the Department
and will, it is hoped, soon have several
companion models.
DEPARTMENT ENTERS EXHIBI-
TION OF WORK.
Michigan has been selected as one of
ten institutions giving architectural courses,
to make an exhibition of work done in the
department, at the annual convention of
the American Institute of Architects, to be
held in Washington. D. C, on December 2,
3, and 4.
The following universities and technical
institutes will be represented: Columbia,
Cornell, Harvard, Pennsylvania, California,
Illinois, Washington University, of St.
Louis. Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology and Carnegie Institute of Tech-
nology.
Each exhibitor will be assigned a space
of eight feet by ten feet, and the depart-
ment of architecture has prepared three
large stretchers, with which to fill its space.
?NEW SURVEYING BUILDING?
There is a rumor to the effect that a new
Building for the Surveying Department is
under consideration. It will be a welcome
addition, indeed, to the group of splendid
buildings now on the Michigan Campus.
The old building has about seen its period
of usefulness, and is, in fact far over-
crowded at the present time.
UNIVERSITY EXTENSION SERVICE.
In the university extension service for
1914-1915, the number of professors from1
the Engineering Department shows the in-
creasing interest thriiout the state in engi-
neering subjects. The following professors
in the Engineering Department are on the
list of speakers for 1914-1915:
John R. Allen, H. C. Anderson, Benja-
min F. Bailey, L. H. Boynton, Edward M.
Bragg, E. D. Campbell, Dean M. E. Cooley,
J. J. Cox. W. T. Fishleigh, H. H. Higbie,
Wm. C. Hoad, C. T. Johnston, S. F. Kim-
ball. Emil Lorch. E. B. Merrick. G. W.
Patterson, Beverley Robinson, H. C. Sad-
ler. E. E. Ware, A. E. White. A. H. White.
S. J. Zowski
Many of the subjects announced should
prove of very general interest. One of
Prof. Boynton's subjects is, "Florence as
Seen by an Architect." illustrated with
Lantern slides. Dean Cooley will speak on.
"The Relation of Public Utilities to the
Public." Mr. Cox has several lectures,
one of which should be of very especial
interest to the people of Michigan, "Michi-
gan's Dollars and Michigan's Roads.''
Prof. Robinson has three very interesting
illustrated subjects: "The Gothic Cathe-
drals of Europe;" "Among the Cathedrals
of England;" "The Royal Palaces and
Chateaux of France.'' Prof. A. H. White
speaks on a subject that is daily becoming
more vitally important, namely, "The
Chemist versus the High Cost of Living."
The value of the extension service has
been increasing year by year as evidenced
by the increased number of lectures in
1913-1914 and by the increased average
attendance. Prof. Henderson, who is at


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the head of the Extension Bureau, expects
this year to be the most successful in the
history of the work.
POWER PLANT PROGRESS.
The New Power Plant will be doing all
the campus heating and lighting after
December 1st, and the old plant will be
■out of commission, except for the switch
board. It is planned to make the old plant
a part of the mechanical laboratory of the
University, greatly increasing the facilities
for research, and relieving present conges-
tion. The hospital plant will be kept in
operation for the present.
The switch-board recently installed in
the New Power plant is one of the few
in the country built of glass and is, there-
fore, of special interest. All switching is
controlled from this panel except the oil
switches, which are operated by a system
■of levers.
All steam-fitting, plumbing and electric
wiring in the New Science Building is be-
ing installed by the University Buildings
and Grounds Department of which J. H.
Marks. '08M, is Superintendent.
MUSICAL ENGINEERS.
That the Engineering students are not
so prosaic and narrow minded as to never
let their eyes pass beyond the end of their
slide rules, is shown by the number in the
coll of the "Michigan Band." This is the
'Varsity band that astounded Harvard when
it marched on Soldier's field last November
at the time of the Michigan-Harvard game,
and covered itself with glory.
Among the Engineering students who are
taking part in the band are: L. O. Arnold,
'15; E. M. Brady, '15; A. B. Castle, '16;
M. B. Cutting, '17; H. B. Forsythe, '17;
F. C. Wheeler, '15; C. B. Worth, '15. Mr.
Hoexter, of the Mechanical Engineering
Faculty, is the Manager of the band, and
under his management, the organization
has had by far the most successful year in
its existence.


R. A. Plumb, 'o6E., had a narrow es-
cape from being caught in the European
war. He expected to be in Berlin on Aug-
ust 15 to appear in some litigation over a
German patent of his but saw when he
reached London that it was useless to pro-
ceed. Mr. Plumb has for eight years been
associated with the Trussed Concrete Steel
Company of Detroit and is now general
director of a separate company organized
as the Trus-Con Laboratories, which hand-
les and manufactures protective coatings
for concrete. Mr. Plumb has become a
specialist on protective coatings and has
valuable patents of his own. He has re-
cently started a new monthly magazine en-
titled "Structural Conservation" to further
the science of water-proofing.
B. M. Ferguson, holder of the Gas Fel-
lowship for the year 1909-10 has recently
been appointed supervisor of the Gas Bur-
eau of the City of Chicago. Mr. Fergu-
son, after leaving the university, was with
the engineering department of the Detroit
City Gas Company and with the Lloyd Con-
struction Company. It is pleasant to know
that he obtained his present position solely
on the ground of his training and exper-
ience and without any political influence.
His first report bears the date of October
r. 1914, and contains, in addition to the sta-
tistics concerning the work in the City of
Chicago, considerable information con-
cerning the history of the People's Gas,
Light and Coke Company and the various
reorganizations it has undergone. A state-
ment in one of the gas journals intimates
that this was issued as a preliminary to a
campaign for fifty cent gas in the City of
Chicago.

drated, with grains of anhydride fully de-
veloped, and whose basic calsium sulphate
increases with rising temperature, is very
nice.

The Wickes Vertical Water-Tube Boiler
Very high thermal efficiency is obtained from this boiler and
setting, because:—
ist—High furnace temperature results from Dutch oven.
2nd—Gases entirely surround and closely scrub heating sur-
face from entrance to release.
3rd—The gases cannot leave the heating surface. There is
no possible chance for short-circuiting.
4th—Boiler heating surface absorbs the heat—empty pockets
in setting lose heat. There are no empty pockets in this
boiler.
5th—The steel-cased settings are always tight. No cracked,
warped, leaky, defective and unsightly settings exist with
this setting.
6th—A steel-cased setting is a simple and sure cure for air
infiltration losses. The largest preventable losses we have
to contend with in boiler efficiency are excess air losses.
7th—A very long gas travel—hence long contact with heating
surface is provided—hence heat absorption is assured.
The "WICKES" boilers are boilers that engineers and
business men are, more and more, not merely thinking about
and considering—but, Purchasing--for good and profitable
reasons!

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Young William F. Dc Quincy Brown
A well-behaved from Boston town
Declared with all his main and might
That come what would, he'd be polite.
At Boston Tech the Registrar said:
"Tell me what your courses are.''
And Bill politely said "I'm here
To l&gt;e a Civil Engineer."
* * *
THOSE GOGGLES AGAIN.
He couldn't play football at all
At Tennis he served like a petrified man
At baseball or cricket or kicking the wic-
ket
His athletic prowess went flash in the pan.
Scholastically he was a dub.
He couldn't tell izzard from Magdalefle
Bay.
He never would study and said it was
"Bloody
That bloomin' old faculties hindered his
play."
Hut still he got by like a top.
I found out the why and the wherefore
at last:
He wore to his classes those tortoise
shell glasses
W hat prof would have courage to mark
him "not passed?"
* * *
THE REASON.
My Roman striped shirts arc of filmiest
silk
My Russian calf shoes cost a bushel of
dollars
My new English overcoat forced me to bilk
My dad of a fortune, but he never hollers—
He's deaf and dumb, poor dad.
My imported scarfs and cravats are the
best.
—Than a cobweb no thicker—■
My hose? Cloth of gold
My tweeds and my dress clothes match up
with the rest
THE TALE OF THE VVUMPUS.
There once was a pop-eyed and squidgy
young wumpus
Who rarely would laugh and was ne'er
seen to smile
He was calm as could be and would shun
any rumpus
There was not such a wumpus in many a
mile.
At college (where every young wumpus is
sent), he
Adhered to the teachings his father had
taught.
But soon, since his kale came in bunches
and plenty,
He purchased some things that he never
had bought.
He was pop-eyed, I said, so he purchased
some glasses
With tortoise shell rims, so his eyes
ceased to pop.
He purchased a Saxon and drove it to
classes
This wumpus was sowing a peach of a
crop.
He smoked cigarettes and was seen drink-
ing liquor
He mastered the difficult science of draw
His eye when he looked at a girl wouldn't
flicker
His father was "dad"—and he used to be
"paw."'
He took up sorority fussing, in madness.
They tamed him so well he would sit up
and beg
lump through or roll over, or bark out of
gladness
He fussed while his cronies were kidding
the keg.
The worst of it was that he thought they
were peaches
And pipins and la-las and lu-lus and
such
Mamma pays for these, and she isn't a The tales that they tell of his conquests
kicker—
Both her legs were amputated, poor girl.
are screeches
This wumpus was always and ever in dutch.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
He'd lived all his life on the farm, was the
pity
And things from the country appealed
to him yet
And not having met a real squab from the
city
The co-edic stuff was his very best bet.
He got his deserts in a horrible fashion
Oh listen, ye wumpuses, listen and dread
He yielded one spring to loves undying
passion
And stumbled and fell and went out of
his head.
They lived ever after, contented and happy
As neither knew better it served 'em
both right
For he had the kale if he wasn't so snappy
And she wears her pin on her dress day
and night.
* * *
THERE ARE MANY SUCH.
C. E.—Why couldn't he make an engi-
neering society?
M. E.—He couldn't get enough men to-
gether.
