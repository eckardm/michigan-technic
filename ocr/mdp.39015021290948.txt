A PROBLEM IN PURITY
ENGINEERS AT WESTINGHOUSE FACE CREATIVE
CHALLENGES LIKE THIS EVERY DAY
Preparing superpure titanium and other hard-to-
get metals was a tough problem, but Westinghouse
scientists solved it. Their method, called cage-
zone refining, uses an unusual method to melt a
bar of metal while the metal acts as its own cruci-
ble, preventing contamination by a container.
Westinghouse offers you the opportunity to
work on similar stimulating, challenging projects.
Investigate career opportunities at Westinghouse,
where the big expansion program means real

TO THE READER:
This year the Technic begins its 75th year of publication.
First published in 1881, it has come down thru the years at
various times a technical manual, yearbook, and finally a
monthly magazine changing in form from year to year. Now
we come to the year 1956 and we the editors must determine
its format and content for the next school year. Our aim is
to provide the student with useful and enjoyable reading
matter such as technical advances, school news and perhaps
a fiction thriller once in a while. We try to pick out the stories
which will interest you most, but this is a hard task and to do
a good job we request that you, the reader, write and tell us
your opinion of the stories and format of each issue. We will
print all letters received, as long as they don't threaten to fill
up the magazine. That doesn't mean the unfavorable ones go
in the circular file, either. For those of you who are interested
in doing more than writing a letter and want to have a more
active part in reforming the magazine, we suggest you come
to our office and see the editor in charge of news staff tryouts.
For those who are not familiar with the Technic, we will
briefly sketch the organization of the magazine: page 4, the
editor-in-chief puts forth his colorful, monthly, unsyndicated
column — page 5, table of contents — page 11, reading
matter starts — next follows approximately ten pages of solid
reading matter, after that advertising is slipped in.
We advise that you don't skip over the advertising lightly.
It's generally on a higher plain than most advertising and is
very informative.
The Technic is sold about the 15th of each month, de-
pending on bluebooks, at the Engineering Arch, East Engine
and East Hall. A saving of 25 percent can be had by subscrib-
ing now for the school year. You can either drop in to our
office at 2505 East Engineering or just send us the money.

Dear Sir:
Last October and November several
articles appeared in your magazine on
"Professional Unions for Engineers." As
I understand it, the articles were prepared
by an individual named James W. Karper,
and the rebuttal by a girl student.
Would you be so kind as to send me
copies of each of these magazines? At the
same time indicate the cost of the maga-
zines.
I can remember with very much pleas-
ure when I was connected with the

TRANSPORTATION
A measure of the cultural level of any society
is its methods of transportation. Here is the
story of how it all began.
iince the days of the ancient trav-
elers, man has been fascinated by
sailing; flying noiselessly, effortless-
ly over the waves.
Today the phrase, "around the world
in eighty days," no! only sounds less than
miraculous but c\cn seems downright
backward. Once the traveler was an un-
tortunate fellow, a hero simply by rea-
son of his coming and going. Today we
i. an look back on the preceeding cen-
turies with interest—and with a sense of
relief.
In tracing the lot of the traveler
through the years, we could plot points
o( transportation progress on a time
graph. We would probably find it more
interesting to furnish ourselves with some
idea of the cultural milieu of the duy-
out canoe, of the first horse saddle, of the
Roman road system, of the canal traffic of
the American frontier. In many, if not
all cases, progress has depended upon
side-developments: the harnessing of a
more effective power source; the inno-
vation of mechanical arrangements, such
as the horse collar, which transmit that
power more effectively; the building of
better roadways and waterways; the utili-
zation of available raw materials. With-
out the storyteller's customary, "once up-
on a time," let us start somewhere near
the beginning:
As with other animals, it appears that
several manifestations of what might be
termed human beings arose in different
locations on this earth. Some of these
died out; some survived inter-breedings
and migrations to populate the habitable
face of the globe. No one knows where
the cmUatioa of mankind stark
by BETSY PALMER, '58E
mains in a cave at Castillo, in Northern
Spain, show that a reindeer-hunting peo-
ple lived at glacier's edge for around
M),000 years. Then the climate began to
change. About twenty thousand years ago,
this ice sheet, the last of four which have
partially covered the upper northern hem-
isphere, started to melt. Grasslands began
to appear where once there had been pine
forests. With the grasslands came the
wild horses of Asia. These horses were
not used for riding; they provided the
rather haphazard equivalent of three
square meals a day. Through all this time,
man walked.
With this same climatic change, the
grasslands area that is now the Sahara
Desert began to dry up. As water be-
came scarce, hunters and their prey col-
lected in river valleys, such as the Nile.
Behind them, these hunters left pictures
of wild cattle, antelope, asses, giraffes,
and elephants. These pictures still remain
on rocks found in the desert. Both th
plainsmen and their counterparts to the
north had progressed to the stage of us-
ing stone arrow and spear tips. They used
campfires for roasting their meat. Beside
them at their fires sat the first dome
ticated animal: the wolf, ancestor of th
familiar family pooch.
Sledges and Dug-Out Canoes
The New Stone Age, characterized by
a nomadic herding culture, brought twe
important inventions: the sledge and tli
dug-out canoe. The first true


of animals to draw a load is believed to
have been the harnessing of dogs to
sledges in the snowy northlands. North
European bogs have yielded at least 17
sledge runners proven to have been in
use during the Stone Age. One of the
runners found was over ten feet long.
Remains of ancient water transport
have been found in widely separated
places. In Denmark there have been
found canoes made of a single sheet of
spruce bark which has been established
as prehistoric. These are believed to ante-
date dug-out canoes, as their construction
would not require such sharp and sturdy-
tools as those needed to chop down and
hollow trees.
Dug-outs have been found in the An-
chelome River of eastern England and in
the Erith marshes of Kent, England. In
the latter place, flint axes and scrapers
were found in a canoe. Dug-outs found
in Denmark have been dated no later
than the middle neolithic (neo: new -|-
lith: stone) period by a method known
as pollen analysis. Recently a canoe has
been found in the River Trent which was
constructed of two pieces: the separate
stern piece fitted into a groove on the
for'ard piece and the joint was caulked
with moss.
Moving southward, we come to the
river valley cultures of the Nile and the
Tigris-Euphrates. Here the taming of the
wolf enabled the one-time hunters to
herd their game. The cliffs along the
Nile River offered the cave shelter famil-
iar to the hunters. But along the twin riv-
ers, the Tigris and Euphrates, there were
no such living quarters, and man learned
to fashion brick from the river mud. Long
before 3000 B.C. the brick had been in-
vented, for at that time villages were built
atop great mounds: the product of suc-
cessive building and leveling over the
years. These mounds have in recent years
yielded a rich record of man's progress in
the use of metals: first copper, then
bronze, and finally iron.
As' the herded animals became more
nearly domesticated, their keepers be-
came more settled and began to raise their
own green, leafy vegetables and vitamin-
rich, fresh bakery bread—oops, wrong
era. At any rate, man began to harness
oxen to pull the plows they had invented.
They began to shift part of the weight
of the world onto the sometimes not so
willing shoulders of their donkeys. After
using the donkey to carry goods it was
natural to use him for riding, also. It is
interesting to notice that neither horse
nor saddle was seen in these parts until af-
ter the beginning of recorded history. In
the field of water transport, we find on
the Nile even today the practice of tying
three legs of a goatskin, inflating it, and
holding the twisted fourth leg to keep
the air in—the first water wings.
To find instances of the raft we must
travel further south into equatorial and
South Pacific waters, where ocean-going
rafts carried the first inhabitants of Aus-
tralia and their European dogs to that
far-off continent. In Northwest Austr.il-
tralia, a raft made without the aid of any
metal fastenings was used. It was called
the catamaran, and consisted of two fan-
shaped rafts of shaped logs, overlapped
and fastened together at the narrow end.
Here, dates are much more difficult to
establish, but this raft certainly belongs
to what was the stone age for its makers.
There are two types of transportation as-
sociated with this area that do not seem
to have equivalents in Europe: the coracle
and the outrigger canoe.
The coracle was a basket-like arrange-
ment, covered with animal skins. The out-
rigger canoe, paddled by several men,
was narrow and had one or two floats
fastened rigidly out a distance from the
side. The earliest ones are believed to
have been double, that is, to have a float
on each side. The design of these was
faulty, in that heavy seas inevitably
washed over and tore off one float, break-
ing the side of the boat. It is believed
that the later development was the single
outrigger, which had the advantage that
a shift of weight in the canoe could keep
the single float always on the surface of
the water. In such places as the Fiji Is-
lands these outriggers were 100 feet in
length, were fitted with a huge triangular
sail, and are known to have been quite
speedy craft.
The Advent of the Horse
Today, when Old Dobbin is fast dis-
appearing and the chief admirers of the
horse are those whose medium of ex-
change is the cereal box top, it is hard to
realize how much of transportation history
is involved with the horse. In 1878 the
probable forebear of the present-day
horse was discovered by a Russian ex-
plorer. Colonel Prjevalski, on the steppes
of Central Asia. Anthropologists think
that, over 4000 years ago, a warrior cul-
ture lived in the area north or north-east
of the Caspian Sea, and that these people
conquered to the northwest and south-
east, forcing their language on the peo-
ple conquered. Evidence supporting this
is found in a family of languages, in-
cluding Latin, Greek, German, French,
and English, as well as the ancient Sans-
krit of India. These languages have sim-
ilar words for many things, including the
horse. Thus, it is expected that the horse
was first tamed in this culture, and that
here bridles and bits were first used. The
latter were probably at first only strong,
twisted leather straps, with horn cheek-
pieces.
The Egyptian culture became known to
the modern world earlier than others, pri-
marily as a result of well-furnished
tombs left as provision for the hereafter.
Various evidence from these and from
the religious writings of the Jewish peo-

duced to Egypt about 1800 B.C. by the
conquering Hyksos, who swept down
along the coast from the northeast with
horse and chariot.
The Egyptians had used sledges on
rollers in moving great weights, placing
sleepers under the rollers to serve in lieu
of a road-bed. However, the use of light-
er weight wheels on an axle had apparent-
ly never occurred to them. Just where,
when, and how the wheel was invented
cannot be said, but the best estimates
place the occurence before 3000 B.C.,
somewhere in southern or western Asia,
perhaps in Mesopotamia, the land of the
Tigris-Euphrates. Some discoveries at the
ancient Mesopotamian cities of Kish and
Ur, hometown of Abraham, father of the
Jewish people, lead to this belief. From
these indications, the first wheels were
made of solid wood with leather tires.
At first chariots were made of bronze,
an expensive alloy of copper and tin. It
was not until iron was used for their con-
struction that chariots became plentiful
enough to be of military advantage. The
period of discovery and use of iron was
that during which much of the Scripture
common to the Jewish and Christian
faiths was written. In the accounts of
Joshua and Judges reference is made to
iron chariots and the advantage they lent
their possessors. "And the Lord was with
Judah; and he drove out the inhabitants
of the mountain; but could not drive out
the inhabitants of the valley, because they
had chariots of iron," is an example from
the first chapter of Judges.
The use of the horse rested for many
years at this stage of development, wait-
ing for an invention which would reveal
the horse as capable of pulling great
loads. In ancient times, the horse was
used almost exclusively for warfare, be-
cause the yoke developed for oxen did
not suit the horse at all.
There was one important outgrowth of
the horse and chariot combination. This
was the great road system of the Persian
Empire, which stretched from the Aegean
Sea to India during the two centuries be-
tween 530 and 330 B.C.
Non-Muscle Power: the Sail
Mention has already been made of the
100-foot canoes of the South Pacific is-
landers. These boats could hold 100 peo-
ple and their provisions and were used
for voyages of over 1000 miles. This
knowledge provides a substantial basis
for saying that Stone Age man must have
used sails on his rafts and possibly on
his dug-out canoes. It is thought that
during the Middle Stone Age fairly long
sea voyages were made with such sails
as could be constructed of skins sewn
together.
According to Egyptian belief, the little
wooden models buried with a deceased
ruler would magically be converted into
their life-sized counterparts, to be ready
for the buried person in the hereafter.
Among the articles found buried in Egypt
were ship models, the ship supposedly
being involved in a journey to a land of
the dead. These are the earliest ships we
is rumored that Phoenicians went to Brit-
ain for tin. Whether they actually reached
British soil or not, it is fairly certain that
they at least traded with intermediaries
for British tin. A Greek writer reports
that Phoenician sailors rounded the tip
of Africa about 596 B.C., stopping twice
to grow crops.
The square sail used in the Mediter-
ranean in that day was useless for sail-
ing into the wind. It may have been this
fact that prompted the Greeks to use
oars for the main motive power in their
warships. The chief weapon of these ships
know to have bourne sails. The Egyptians
had engineered a canal from the Nile to
the Red Sea, which they navigated either
by sailing or rowing. Open Egyptian
ships, with a square sail and two rows
of oarsmen, even sailed down the Afri-
can coast from the Red Sea.
The world had discovered copper,
which was regarded as a soft form of
stone; more important, the world had
discovered that, by mixing tin with cop-
per, a harder substance could be formed,
which would effectively hold an edge.
But tin and copper are found in widely
separated parts of the Mediterranean
area. Whether this fact prompted or
perpetuated the commercial activities of
the Phoenicians is merely an academic
question. The fact remains that these
people, who originally lived on a tiny
strip of land between mountains and sea
on the Syrian Coast, were better shipbuild-
ers than the Egyptians, and that their tra-
vels were more extensive. Part of the rea-
son for their superior shipbuilding lies in
the long planks available to them from
Lebanon cedars. The Egyptians were re-
stricted to the shorter acacia planks. While
Sidon and Tyre, ports situated on rocky
islands, were the chief cities of the Phoe-
nicians, Carthage, on the African coast,
was a Phoenician colony. As the upstart
Romans began to gain in power, Car-
thaginians were detailed by the almost
exclusively trading people of Tyre and
Sidon to protect the Phoenician trade. It
was a sharp metal ram which would
pierce the hull of an enemy ship at the
water line. These ships powered by row-
ing are known as galleys, and many of
them came from Athens. Around 500 B.C.
the Greeks exported large quantities of
wine and olive oil. The vases and jars
used as shipping containers were made
in Greece, and since potters followed the
practice of putting trademarks on their
ware, we can trace a large number of the
vessels to Athens. From Greek writings,
we know that the so-called trireme was
the galley of highest technical achieve-
ment. It is supposed that the name re-
fers to the use of three tiers of oarsmen,
but there are no remains, pictures, writ-
ings, or actual boats to uphold this idea.
In contradistinction to the Greek gal-
leys, the grain ships of the Romans had
no oars whatsoever. Northern Africa and
Egypt were used by the Romans as a
giant wheat farm, and the ships used to
carry wheat back to the Italian penin-
sula had no space for galley slaves. Mo-
tive power was provided by a huge square
mainsail plus a smaller sail on an "ar-
temon" mast at a 45° slope forward. It
is thought by some that this was the first
step toward a three-masted ship. These
grain ships were heavily built and were
the largest ships seen for nearly 1000
years. They could carry 10,000 talents'
worth of wheat, or 250 tons. The Ro-
mans used galleys very similar to those of

A few years ago, the railroads seemed
destined to disappear into the pages of
history. Railroad service had not im-
proved appreciably since the beginning
of the century. Competition from air-
lines and buses had taken away passen-
gers while pipe lines and highway trucks
had made huge inroads into their freight
revenue. The railroads had, and still have,
the disadvantage of maintaining their own
road bed and paying taxes on it also. Air-
lines get government subsidies and truck-
ers pay only a small fraction of the cost
of the highways they use. The railroad
business seemed unable to meet the com-
petition; but, making an amazing come-
back, the railroads in 1955 had a record
year. This year, they are expected to break
the records of 1955. What is the reason
for this apparent reversal of history? Can
the railroads keep improving their posi-
tion despite fierce competition?
Railroad men viewed the dropping
graphs with more than alarm. They knew
something had to be done and set def-
inite plans into motion. It was time for
the railroads to modernize, to reorganize,
to make plans for the future. Some com-
panies started at the top by changing
Board Chairmen, while others cut yard
crews and lesser employees. All knew that
they must modernize their equipment and
business organization if they were to sur-
vive. A usually conservative industry
launched itself into bold and imagi-
native plans.
This year, the railroads are spending
over one billion dollars for new equip-
ment. It is this new equipment which is
making the railroad industry profitable
once more. Let us consider in detail a
typical example of that new equipment,
the General Motors Aero-train.
A new design was needed to econ-
omize railroad transportation. Railroad
cars are usually built to last half a cen-
tury. Both the initial cost of the car and
the maintenance costs are high. A rail-
road car can not be replaced every few
years. Buses, however, are not designed
to be used more than five or ten years.
Their construction is not so enduring as
that of a railroad car but it is not ex-
pected to be. The fact that they are re-
placed after a relatively short period of
time makes it possible for new ideas and
new models to be spread often. It was
decided by most railroad men that they
Light weight construction

parts makes the Aerotrain's
coaches superior to conven-
tional types.
would have to adopt some methods of
their opponents. They decided to induce
the development of a train with cars con-
structed with a lower initial cost and
shorter life expectancy.
General Motors was the logical choice
for this undertaking since they were al-
ready building body units for highway
passenger carriers. The first concept was
to put the inter-city highway coach body
on railroad wheels. Highway body parts
were assembled to a railroad type under-
frame. Instead of compartments for
driver and engine, vestibules with side
entrances at the front and rest rooms
and service facilities at the rear were
added. The width of the body was wi-
dened 1 to 8 inches to make a wider aisle
and to facilitate comfortable seating.
The objective of the train was to simp-
lify and economize rail service. Three
limits were placed, determining the area
in which the engineers had to work.
First, the weight of the entire train, lo-
comotive and ten cars, must be close to
600,000 lbs. gross weight. Next, the
costs, both investment and operation, of
the Aerotrain must be less than conven-
tional ones. Finally, the styling had to
be imaginative so it would stimulate in-
terest in new passenger train equipment.
Several factors were weighed in deter-
mining passenger capacity. Requirements
of washrooms and service facilities, the
conventional method of seating in high-
way coaches as necessitated by the de-
sign, and the increase in car weight as
length increases, were all considered. The
most practical answer was a capacity of
forty passengers per car.

gan Alumnus, Chuck Jordan, heads this
group.
Some innovations were the use of a
four wheel undercarriage, instead of the
one truck to two cars type found on some
modern train designs. The high seat of
the highway coach was adopted also. It
proved to give better passenger visibility
and increased passenger safety in the
event of a side collision. Each car was
designed with enough individuality to
meet the requirements of the various rail-
roads; they were not unworkable apart.
The designers of the Aerotrain had
the unique opportunity, however, to de-
sign the locomotive and cars as one func-
tioning unit rather than just conforming
to certain general standards. This gave
them the chance to increase economy also.
The size of the engines and the size of
the cars was determined by what each
contributes toward the whole train. An
auxilary power source, located in the lo-
comotive, furnishes power for lighting
and for heating. This eliminates long
steam and water lines which furnished
notoriously poor heating. The steam con-
nections, both electrical and air can be
made as the cars are coupled. A new air
brake could now be designed as the en-
gineers were free of the problem of it
having to be interchangable with conven-
tional models.
The standard used for determining the
type of engine to be used was the min-
imum horsepower needed to pull the
600,000 lbs. at a maximum speed of 102
mph. These limiting figures might have
been influenced by the fact that the Gen-
eral Motors 12-cylinder 567C Diesel, giv-
ing 1200 horsepower was adequate to
furnish these figures, representing a con-
siderable saving. Also, two Electro-Mo-
tive D-37 traction motors could develop
enough power to meet load requirements,
contributing to a simpler rear locomotive
truck and saving in weight.
The overall design of the locomotive,
both exterior and interior, is radical. The
components of the Aerotrain are arranged
usually as depicted in the diagram. The
exterior styling is formed by simply weld-
ing light gage steel over a structural
framework.
Two "fish belly" I-beam center sills
make up the underframe and are the main
supporting members for the car, body,
and cab. The entire underframe is all-
welded construction.
The General Motors Engineering
Journal of July, August, and September
aptly describes the location of the com-
ponents of the locomotive:
The main motive-power equipment consists
of the 12-567 Diesel engine and a standard
Electro-Motive D-15 d-c generator, located in
the depressed, "fish belly" section of the un-
derframe to lower the center of gravity, and
the two Electro-Motive D-37 traction motors,
located on the front 2-axle truck. Major com-
ponents between the Diesel power package and
the control cab are the air compressor, dynamic
brake hatch, and the electrical control cabinet.
The air brake equipment is mounted beneath
the cab floor. Cooling equipment is located
at the rear of the locomotive. In the nose of
the locomotive are mounted two auxiliary
Diesel power units used to supply electrical
power for train lighting, heating, and air con-
ditioning. These are standard units consisting
of 6-cylinder, Model 6-71 Detroit Diesel En-
gines powering 440-v, 3-phase, 60-cycle Delco
a-c generators.
Some changes have been made in con-
trol devices. A device similar to an auto-
mobile gear shift, called a transition, con-
trols relay and connects or disconnects the
traction motors. This makes it possible
to use only one of them on some occa-
sions, resulting in power saving.
The car design began with a strong,
steel frame. The body mounted on it is
in many respects like a standard intercity
highway coach body. The dimensions of
the car are: length, 40'6"; height, 10'9",
and width, 9'6".

car is only 45 inches above the ground,
while the car is, however, about 43 inches
above the ground. Most of the weight is
concentrated in the undercarriage and
supports. The body can be removed if
necessary and a new one assembled to
the frame. Old railroad cars had to be
overhauled every 7 years. The cost of
this overhaul is comparable to that of a
new body for the Aerotrain car. When a
new Aerotrain body is put on the under-
carriage, it has built into it all the mod-
ern advances in styling, comfort, and
safety. The old car is merely refurbished
and is the same old design without mod-
ern improvements.
The passenger compartment has 40 re-
clining seats, fluorescent lighting, and
package racks. Special bulkheads connect
cars, giving a better impression of con-
tinuity and adding to passenger safety.
By eliminating ornate design features
found in most old style railroad coaches,
the Aerotrain has reduced the cleaning
problem and expense to a minimum. The
interior finish is either aluminum or some
other durable substance.
An air-ride device, developed by GMC
and used on highway coaches acts as
shock absorber for the Aerotrain. Eight
bellows like devices, four on each axle,
■have variable air pressure which cushions
bumps in the road bed.
Frigidaire Division developed the air
conditioning unit which is the heart of
the system used on the Aerotrain. A five-
ton refrigeration unit with a re-heat cycle
for dehumidification and temperature
control. An 8-kw coil immersed in the
water transfers its heat to the water at
the rate of 28,300 BTU-hr. If more heat
is needed in the car, an oil fired heater
can produce 150,000 BTU-hr.
Significant cost and weight savings
were achieved on the brake system. Plas-
tic brake shoes were used in place of cast
iron. The plastic ones require only one-
third as much breaking force to produce
a given breaking action as does cast iron.
This makes it possible to have smaller
brake cylinders. In case of an emergen-
cy, a standard locomotive could haul
from 2 to 12 Aerotrain cars safely by
using features built into the breaking
system.
The Aerotrain is just emerging from
the testing stage. Yet, it gives an answer
to many problems. It shows how to com-
bine a steel frame with an aluminum body
while retaining safety. The Aerotrain ap-
plies air suspension to a four wheel car.
There is the achievement of low center
of gravity without sacrificing height. It
shows a passenger car body can be re-
placed, independent of the undercarriage,
more cheaply than reconditioning a con-
ventional car. The major feature of the
Aerotrain is economy, economy of con-
struction, economy of maintenance. It was
put together from existing equipment and
contains all the know how of the truck
and bus coach industry. The Aerotrain
and others like it indicate the future of
the railroads. They illustrate that rail-
roads can be improved far above present
levels. Improved equipment is going to
help railroads retain their place in our
transportational system.
Dramatic evidence is furnished by the
Aerotrain of what engineers can do to
overcome one specific problem. In the
Aerotrain they attacked and defeated high
cost. Some say that atomic power can be
more easily adopted to railroads than to
any other form of land transportation.
Perhaps it can, or does the monorail offer
more immediate possibilities? The rail-
roads are not ready to retire to the pages
of history; they are still able to make it.

Western Electric development engineer
Dick Foster Joined Western Electric, the manufacturing and supply unit of the
Bell System, in February 1952, shortly after earning his B. S. in mechanical
engineering at the University of Illinois. As a development engineer on a
new automation process Dick first worked at the Hawthorne Works in
Chicago. Later, he moved to the Montgomery plant at Aurora, Illinois
where he is pictured above driving into the parking area.
Dick's day may begin in one of several ways: an informal office chat
with his boss, a department "brain session" to tackle a particularly
tough engineering problem (above); working with skilled machine
builders in the mechanical development laboratory; or "on the line"
(below) where he checks performance and quality and looks for new
ways to do things.
Here Dick and a set-up man check over the automatic production line used to man-
ufacture a wire spring relay part for complex telephone switching equipment. This
automatic line carries a component of the relay on a reciprocating conveyor
through as many as nine different and very precise operations—such as percussive
welding in which small block contacts of palladium are attached to the tips of
wires to within a tolerance of ± .002".
Examining the plastic molded "comb" components of the wire
spring relay Dick recalls his early work when he was involved
in working-up forming and coining tools for the pilot model of
the automation line for fabrication of wire spring sub-assemblies
for relays. At present he is associated with the expansion of
these automation lines at the Montgomery Plant.
Dick finds time for many Western Electric employee activities. Here he is
scoring up a spare while tuning up for the engineers' bowling league. He is
active also in the golf club, camera club, and a professional engineering so-
ciety. Dick, an Army veteran, keeps bachelor quarters in suburban Chicago
where he is able to enjoy the outdoor life as well as the advantages of the city.

Here is the story of the once obsolete seaplane that is now
being developd into a potent tactical weapon.
The seaplane or flying boat, almost
eliminated from aviation as a result of
design stagnation, is returning as a pos-
sible solution to some of aviation's most
perplexing problems.
The development of water based air-
craft began in 1911 in San Diego, Cali-
fornia, where Glenn Curtiss made the
first practical seaplane flight. The craft,
a pusher, was designed as a plane that
would float. However, it soon got caught
in a design philosophy which almost
caused its extinction. What began as an
airplane that would float became a boat
that would fly.
In the 1920's, the seaplanes or flying
boats led all other types of aircraft by
being the fastest, largest, capable of car-
rying the heaviest loads and having the
longest range. They reached their peak
in the 1930's when Sikorsky, Martin, Boe-
ing and Convair flying boats pioneered
air lanes.
During this time, unfortunately, de-
sign stagnated with the old Navy Curtis
NC of 1919 setting the pace. In the bat-
tle for speed, water based aircraft fell
behind.
It became customary to think of water
based aircraft in terms of lumbering
Clippers of Pan American South Ameri-
can runs or slow Mars flying boats on
Navy runs from Honolulu to Alameda,
California.
As Convair's hydrodynamic enthusiast
E. G. Stout stated in 1951, "Water based
air transports ruled the world's air lanes
of aerial commerce for years due to their
ability to provide unmatched economy,
comfort, versatility and safety. Lacking
one essential ingredient—speed—other in-
herent qualities were compromised in fa-
vor of the landplane."
The advent of the jet engine all but
put the flying boat out of the race. The
high drag of the hull, the design of
which had become under the realm of
naval architecture, made this type of en-
gine impractical.
Then, fortunately for the flying boat,
came a new design philosophy. Designers
said the water based craft should not be
boats that could fly but planes that could
float. Aerodynamics should not be com-
promised to achieve water basing.
High speed blended wing and hull de-
signs were developed. Increased hull
length to beam ratio improved the sea-
worthiness and gave a 500f/r increased
hull loading.
These developments have enabled the
complete closing of the gap in relative-
speed between the seaplane and land-
plane. Soon, seaplanes will be able to do
anything landplanes can do and still have
the advantage of water based operations.
Other developments, too, have helped
in slimming down the bulky old work-
horse seaplane. Convair developed a
spray suppression strip or dam to con-
trol effectively all spray. Being retract-
able, it leaves a clean hull, thus doing
away with the chine or step in the hull,
a major cause of air drag.
Because of this about face in design
philosophy, tomorrow's seaplanes —
freighters, passenger or fighter—will not
resemble the stepped hull configuration
of recent years.
Stemming from the U.S. Navy's posi-
tion on high speed flying boats for fight-
er design, the development of hydrofoils
and hydroskis have become subjects of
current interest. Landings and take offs
will be made with the combination of
these airfoils to operate under water and
planing areas to skip across the water.
A hydrofoil is an underwater airfoil.
It generates a lifting force when under
the water much the same as an airfoil
generates lift as it moves through the air.
This force lifts the attached craft out of
the water for a takeoff.

graphic recordings being tested at Lindbergh
Field, San Diego.
The hydroski is a planing surface re-
sembling the water ski used for sport. It
supports the aircraft on the surface of
the water. It does not act as an airfoil
except at very slow speeds.
The difference between the hydrofoil
and the hydroski is merely one of de-
gree. There is no reason why a surface
can not act as a foil first and then as
speed increases function as a hydroski
until the airplane is airborne.
They were first used in 1930 by the
Italians on a Piaggo racer intended for
the Schneider trophy races. Landing gear
legs held a pair of smallish surfaces in-
clined outward and forward. The plane
started in a semi-submerged state with
the prop backed to a horizontal attitude.
Some power was directed to a small mar-
ine propeller to initially move the plane.
Once the plane started moving, their lift
got it airborne.
The hydrofoil or hydroski will find in-
creasing application in seaplane designs
with high speed characteristics. Being of
small size and of two dimensional ap-
pearance, it is ideal for retraction so as
to leave a clean hull.
With their speed no longer a draw-
back, the future of water based aircraft
is assured. They are capable of doing
anything landplanes do and still have the
advantage of water based operations.
These planes could very well be the
solution to cramped airport locations and
crowded traffic patterns.
Probably the first commercial uses of
the seaplane will be as an air freighter.
When airports get congested, the first
airplanes to get thrown out of the traffic
pattern will be freighters.
These airports to which freighters
would have gone are usually located near
large cities. Most large cities are located
on a harbor or waterway. Thus, the sea-
planes can land right in the city's har-
bors. No major freight house invest-
ments would have to be made to ac-
comodate the seaplane, either, for ware-
houses and railroads close to the water-
fronts are already available.
These harbor landing areas are cheap-
er to maintain than airports. The harbor
need only be cleared, the airport requires
constant repairs. The high bottom pres-
sures of modern hulls automatically pre-
vent all but large objects from coming in
contact. Very large objects can be seen
and avoided.
As to the question of safety with re-
gard to seaplanes, seaplanes are much
safer than landplanes. There is almost
no place in the United States where wa-
ter based aircraft will be out of reach of
an emergency landing zone. Naturally,
the seaplane is made to land and float on
water where a landplane is not. In the
"wheels up" type of landing which land-
plane make in an emergency, the rein-
forced hull of the water based aircraft
affords greater protection than the belly
of a landplane.
When jet powered the seaplane finds
itself in an advantageous position over the
landplane. Jet aircraft require a very long
runway to land on. Their landing speed
is high and with no way of reversing the
thrust to slow the plane down, a long
distance is required for the plane to roll
to a halt. In a large harbor, a long land-
ing strip is assured. In addition, the
force of the water slows down the plane
considerably.
With the landing area near the down-
town area of large cities and not the
residential areas, the traveling from far
out airports to downtown areas is elim-
inated. In some cases, this traveling time
nullifies the advantage of taking an air-
plane. A hidden blessing accompanies this
change in landing areas. The noise of
airports is removed from the quiet resi-

dential area to the noisy downtown area.
Jet landings on water rather than land
have advantages. Landing a jet aircraft
on a concrete runway is a precise man-
euver requiring the assistance of con-
siderable scientific apparatus. Jet seaplanes
will be much easier to land. A radar re-
flector on a rubber raft will be sufficient
for a seaplane where alignment errors
can be measured safely and corrected over
three or four hundred yards, thus avoid-
ing the necessity of pulling up and mak-
ing a second landing approach.
The seaplane pilot has an excellent
chance of landing even if no ground
aids are available by taking advantage of
the unfortunate property of radar of
picking up bodies of water. When all
other discrimination fails, the pilot can
still find water to set down on.
Another argument for the use of jet
seaplane transports comes as a result of
the fact that the large airports of the
world are unsuited for jet transports.
Jets simply cannot take stacking, the
circling of planes in a vertical column
over an airport while they wait to land.
Over harbors, there are wide tolerances
available for bringing in for water land-
ing all jet transports without stacking.
The only thing similar to stacking would
be the planes cruising in water waiting
to go to an unloading dock. Under the
same conditions, the only emergency exit
open to air stacked jet landplanes are the
same areas—only they cannot float.
Beyond the jet powered stage of air-
craft, there lies the nuclear powered
stage. The first nuclear powered aircraft
will probably be a flying boat. The gen-
eral design will be conventional as one
major experimental design, the engine,
will be enough.
The reactor and the heat exchanger
will be in the hull surrounded by lead
shielding. The wall will be pierced in
two spots on the forward face. One will
be for the great air intake ducts from
the wing roots behind it, the other for
hot air outlet ducts which go out through
the wings to carry the heat energy of the
reactor. The hot air operates six turbo-
prop engines each with eight bladed con-
trarotating propellers which are mounted
in the wings jutting forward and back.
Present day design problems are dif-
ferent from future ones for the atom
powered aircraft. One big difference re-
sults from the minute fuel consumption.
There will be no essential difference be-
tween the takeoff and landing weights.
This effects:
Lmding gear design—most landing
gear systems are designed for specific con-
ditions. The plane is assumed to have
been lightened by burned fuel.
Structure—the inertia load distribution
will be different. The central power sta-
tion will be of weight and density un-
common to aircraft.
Aerodynamics—wing loading will be
the same for takeoff and level flight. Pre-
viously, designers used higher loadings
because it was reduced by the loss of
fuel.
On the nuclear powered aircraft, there
will be a considerable time lag in the
powerplant response, larger than for con-
ventional gas turbines. With the reac-
tor, for more power, control rods are
withdrawn from the pile core. They ab-

The answer is young engineers at IBM—long a leader

Perhaps you, too, would find it challenging to
solve problems similar to these typical and
recent IBM problems:
Design and development. Develop a magnetic core
memory using transistor drive circuits. This
involved a study of the characteristics of cores
as a load, of the arithmetic portions of the
machine as a source of information to control
the core driving circuits, and of the pulse
characteristics of transistors.
Manufacturing. In magnetic core storage units,
three or more wires must be woven through every
core in the array, each a tiny doughnut less than
1/10 of an inch in diameter. This weaving process
was a tedious, painstaking hand-operation —a far
Bom desirable method. The development of a rapid
automatic assembly method was necessary to attain
economic volume production.
Field Engineering. Assume responsibility for
performance and maintenance of an entire computer
system (composed primarily of electronic equipment)
in one of today's most vital defense projects.
In addition to exciting assignments, young engineers

Finally—One Retired
Here, for a change, surrounded by an-
nouncements of new planes, is one of our
U.S. aircraft going into retirement. Its re-
search mission completed, the X-3 "flying
stiletto," designed and built by the Doug-
las Santa Monica Division as a predeces-
sor of today's supersonic jet aircraft, has
been retired.
Following almost four years of exten-
sive flight testing, the needle-nosed flying
laboratory has been removed from flight
status with the National Advisory Com-
mittee for Aeronautics and returned to the
Air Force for final disposition.
The turbojet X-3, produced under joint
sponsorship of the Air Force, NACA and
the Navy, was first flown in October,
1952. After numerous research flights for
the Air Force, it was turned over to the
NACA in December, 1953.
The "stiletto," equipped with 1200
pounds of specialized instruments, gath-
ered volumes of extremely valuable tran-
sonic and supersonic data used in the de-
sign of the swift Navy jets and "Century
Series" Air Force fighters.
Its configuration, featuring a pointed
nose, narrow tail and wing span measur-
ing only one-third of the fuselage length,
provided solutions of aerodynamic, ma-
terials and construction problems.
Among the many contributions of the
X-3 project was the development of fab-
rication and construction techniques with
titanium, used extensively throughout the
aircraft.
High-Temperature Mechanical
Liquid Metal Pump
In this atomic age, liquid metal is be-
coming more and more useful as a heat-
transfer medium. In corresponding im-
portance are liquid metal pumps for high-
temperature use. This mechanical liquid
metal pump built by the Westinghouse
Atomic Equipment Department has just
completed a successful 500-hour perfor-
mance test run at more than 1000 de-
grees F—the highest temperature at
which a pump of this type has ever op-
erated for an extended period. It is rated
150 gpm at a 285-foot head.
The new mechanical (centrifugal)
pump has a hermetically-sealed "canned-
rotor" which contains pump and motor
rotor in one integral unit. This isolates
the pumped fluid and all rotating parts
from the field windings and outer atmos-
phere.
Production models of the pump will
operate at temperatures up to 1600 de-
grees F, and will be applied to nuclear
power plants, chemical process lines, and
other applications requiring high-tem-
perature heat-transfer mediums.
King-Size Helicopter Blades
// seems that helicopters are always
sneaking into the news—here are facts
on 34 ft. rotor blades.
Six king-size Alcoa aluminum rotor
blades recently made airborne the world's
largest turbine-driven transport helicopter.
The blades, each 34 ft. long, whirled in
sets of three above each tandem rotor of
Piasecki's huge YH-16A "Turbo Trans-
porter" at its first public showing a few
weeks ago. Developed by Piasecki through
extended research and development in
cooperation with Aluminum Company of
America, the new blades represent a tri-
umph over difficut aerodynamic prob-
lems.
The six prototype blades actually re-
sulted from a teamplay operation involv-
ing Piasecki, Chicago Bridge and Iron
Company, and Alcoa. The process was
slow and costly, but it provided the
"Turbo Transporter" with an answer to
the blade problem.
Two 2,400-lb. plates, after being ma-
chined to exact dimensions, were fitted
together like the halves of a clamshell.
Once joined, they were bonded with res-
in adhesives. Because a rotor blade tends
to droop noticeably when at rest, they
were supported and strengthened intern-
ally with a honeycomb of corrugated
aluminum foil.
Now that a workable design has been
achieved, aluminum blades for future
"Turbo Transporters" can be mass-pro-
duced by the extrusion process.
World's Largest
Generator Transformer Installed
Here's another "first" Michigan can
claim: the world's biggest generator-trans-
former, in River Rouge, a Detroit suburb.
This 315,000-kva, 17.3/129-kv gen-
erator transformer built by Westinghouse
Electric Corporation is the largest ever in-
stalled. The three-phase forced oil-to-air
cooled unit is the first of two identical
units the Company is building for the
No. 1 and No. 2 units of the Detroit Ed-
ison Company's new River Rouge Power
Plant. The second will be installed by
late 1956.

Greetings! How were all the summer
vacations this year? Mine was swell, but
it's just as nice to get back to Ann Arbor.
Michigan, football and that odor of ink
in the technic office.
So, what do we have of interest in the
news after a summer away from U of M?
John S. Macdonald of Schenectady,
N.Y., has become general manager of the
General Electric Company's Distribution
Assemblies Department.
Mr. Macdonald has been manager of
Manufacturing Operations Service in
G-E's Manufacturing Services since 1952.
A native of Lima, Ohio, Mr. Macdon-
ald was graduated from the University of
Michigan in 1931 with a bachelor of sci-
ence degree in mechanical engineering.
He joined General Electric that same
year on the Test Course and in 1932 be-
came a member of the Schenectady Fac-
tory Training Course.
Following successive assignments in
methods, factory supervision, expense-
control, production and union relations,
he was appointed in 1941 as assistant
superintendent in the Aeronautics and
Special Products Department.
From 1945 to 1949, Mr. Macdonald
held successive appointments in the then
centralized Schenectady Works, General
Electric's largest plant location, as assist-
ant supervisor of personnel, assistant to
the General Superintendent, Assistant
Production Manager, and Assistant to the
Works Manager. In 1949 he was assigned
to the Works Service Department, in the
capacity of Assistant Works Manager. He
was named to the position in Manufactur-
ing Services shortly after formation of
that division in 1952.
He is a member of the Schenectady
Chamber of Commerce, American Man-
agement Association, Tau Beta Pi, Hon-
orary Engineering Fraternity at the Uni-
versity of Michigan, and Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, Social Fraternity at the Univer-
sity of Michigan.
The appointment of Robert Thalner as
chief engineer of the Radio and Tele-
vision Division of Sylvania Electric Prod-
ucts Inc. was announced today by Marion
E. Pettegrew, Vice President-Operations

TOUR FUTURE-
Research and Koppers?
If yours is the inquiring mind . . .
the mind that never rests until it has
an answer to every "why" . . . then
perhaps research is your future.
There are many types of research,
but whatever your choice it will be
a future of challenge.
For example, more than a century
ago a synthetic chemical, styrene
monomer, was discovered by some
curious research chemists. But not
until 1937 did research engineers
find a way to produce it commer-
cially. It has been made in large
quantity only since 1944, when it be-
came the principal ingredient of
synthetic rubber for tires, hose, belts
and other products.
Ordinary men would have stopped
and rested at this point . . . but not
research men. Thanks to their re-
search, styrene monomer has become
basic in today's improved paints,
plastics, paper and a host of other
products. Its volume has more than
doubled in the past ten years. And
there are more uses to come!
In addition to styrene monomer,
other chemicals and plastics, Kop-
pers is a leading producer of tar
products, metal products, pressure-
treated wood. It designs and builds
coke, steel and chemical plants.

The transformer, weighing 325,000
pounds, was shipped upright in a one-
piece tank, less bushings and cooling
equipment. The installed unit weighs
448,000 pounds and is about 2414 feet
high (from foundation to bushing tips),
16 2/3 feet wide, and 26 feet long.
Westinghouse also has under construc-
tion a 360,000-kva generator transformer
for the No. 3 unit of the River Rouge-
Plant.
As usual, the weather sneaks into all
discussions. Here's an explanation of why
our Michigan summer this year was so
"comfortable."
Why has this summer been so com-
fortable? Because of a misplaced polar
front and psychology, a University of
Michigan meteorologist reports.
The polar front, says A. Nelson Din-
gle, is located farther south than usual,
and the weather along this line has tend-
ed to alternate from warm to cool anil
back to warm.
Fortunately for Michiganders, cool
Canadian air has predominated over hot
Gulf of Mexico masses, and we have en-
joyed short periods of rapid warming fol-
lowed by thunderstorms and longer peri-
ods of cool weather.
Last year, he reports, the polar front
was farther north, and the torrid Gulf
air dominated the state. The result was
a summer in which the average tempera-
tures for July and August were five de-
grees above normal.
"There is a lot of psychology involved
in discussions of the weather," the U-M
meteorologist says. "Because last summer
was abnormally hot, the winter unusually
prolonged and the months of April and
May cooler than usual, people are greatly
surprised to find this summer so pleas-
ant."
Another factor that influences Mich-
igan weather, Dingle adds, is the Ber-
muda High, a system of air circulating in
a clockwise direction which often over-
laps the Atlantic Coast and pushes hotter
air into the Midwest. It also guides hur-
ricanes inland, than back out to sea.
During the summer of 1955 the Ber-
muda High was located farther west, the
summer was hot, and hurricanes raked the
coast. This year the high is displaced east-
ward, Michigan weather is cooler, and
hurricanes such as the late Betsy are born
and die without reaching the mainland.

COMMERCIAL
JETS
by JAMES STEVANS, '59E
What does the future bold for com-
mercial air travel? Will our present trans-
ports, with their piston type engines, soon
be as obsolete as the twelve-inch television
screen? The men behind the commercial
airlines seem to think so and already have
put in orders for turboprop and turbojet
planes as soon as they are available.
Besides the obvious advantage of in-
creased speed, the jet planes have the
ability to carry greater loads and cruise
for greater distances without refueling.
The turbojet will be more economical on
long runs than present transports. The
turboprop will be used for short runs
which the turbojet can't make econom-
ically. Reports from the manufacturers
on the DC-8 say that it will make the
trip from San Francisco to New York
in about 4 hours 40 minutes plus 15 min-
utes ground time. The westbound flight
will be about 5 hours 35 minutes with 15
/Tiinutes ground time. It will fly at about
^0,000 feet, above most of the bad wea-
ther, except thunderstorms. At this al-
titude there will be very few large hail-
stones and no bird strikes.
But as with any new idea there are
still some details to be ironed out. The
problems fall into three general categor-
ies: noise, traffic control, and airport in-
adequacies.
Although most of the manufacturers
of jet transports have "silenced" the
plane's engine, the mechanics who keep
the planes in running condition may often
have to test the engine without the "si-
lencer." If no ear protection or ineffi-
cient ear protection is offered, it may well
result in loss of hearing for the mechan-
ics. There is no danger for others in the
vicinity. Many home owners in the area
have complained that the noise will de-
preciate the value of their homes. On the
other hand, the airline men state that the
jets will be as quiet if not quieter than
the piston engine planes. They contend
that the increase in trade caused by pas-
sengers in the area will actually raise the
value of the house.
The second general heading of "traf-
fic control" is a problem even if the pres-
ent piston engine planes are used. A sur-
vey of accidents and near accidents
showed that there are four "close shaves'
per day. Under the present system on •&gt;
clear day the pilot judges, by eyesight
only, the closeness of a plane and the
path he should take to avoid the other
plane. The recent air fatalities show the
failure of this system to keep present
planes, as well as the much faster travel-
ing jets, from colliding.
The Civil Aeronautics Administration
has proposed a five-year plan to modern-
ize the nation's air traffic-control sys-
tem. Until the time when their plan can
be adopted they have proposed an inter-
mediate plan for air safety, making in-
strument flying and radio control a ne-
cessity for planes above the 24,000 ft
level. In the end the C.A.A. hopes to

blanket the whole United States with a
radar network making instrument flying
the only type of flying, regardless of
weather conditions. Electronic computers
would chart courses and signal planes
when they are off course or approaching
another plane. A complete navigation
system, more radar, and expanded com-
munications would cost approximately
$245 million and $146 million annual op-
erating cost. In line with their program
the C.A.A.'s plans for fiscal 1957 in-
clude:
1. Twelve route traffic-control towers.
2. Two new approach light systems.
3. Ten landing systems.
4. Nine airport surveillance radars.
5. Forty-five repeaters for existing
and new radars.
6. Twelve precision approach radars.
Speaking on the program, Joseph H.
Tippets, director of the office of Federal
Airways stated, "Today at 300 m.p.h. we
can get only two planes into a block of
100 miles of airspace. By use of radar
traffic control we will be able to put four
airplanes at 300 m.p.h. in the same air-
space."
On the other hand the Private Pilot's
Association is against any such program.
They agree that the high levels where the
jets normally fly should be radar con-
trolled. But they contend that the high
cost of radar and radio equipment needed
for planes under this system will drive
the small private plane owner out of the
skies. They offer suggestions of speed
limits in congested terminal areas and
better cockpit visibility as the answer to
the low flyer's problems.
There is also the question of the effect-
iveness of the radar on jets. The main
reason for the strong blimp on radar
screens from airplanes is the thrashing
of propellors. Much larger transmitters
will be needed to carry out the idea of
the CA.A.
In the third category, inadequate air-
port facilities, fall such obvious things
as Iandstrip length to terminal windows.
There is the possibility that jets might
shatter the large picture windows that
our air terminals today display. Although
it is held highly improbable, it is not
impossible.
The major complaint came from the
airports when an early estimate of 10,000
feet for a landing strip was specified.
There are only three airports in the coun-
try with landing strips that long (Boston,
Denver, and St. Louis). At a million dol-
lars per 1000 feet of air strip the airport
owners and community leaders who have
to appropriate city funds for this purpose
are highly reluctant. But later estimates by
airplane companies revealed a great short-
ening in this 10,000 feet. Other runway
requirements are: added strength (jet
planes weigh twice the present weight of
their piston driven brothers), increased
runway width from 150 feet to 200 feet,

the Greeks for warfare. There were no
passenger ships, as such, in Roman times.
The road system was good enough that
travel by land was preferable to the
uncertainties at sea. However, passage-
could always be found on one of the
hundreds of grain ships.
Various forms of life found in the sea
furnished the- primary share of the liveli-
hood of the early settlers of the Scandin-
avian peninsula. It is estimated that 10,-
000 years ago some of the first of the
hunting tribes were wandering on the
rocky coastlands and faring out upon the
deep sea. This estimate assumes an early
and continuous boat-building culture. By
weighing Stone Age sinkers for fishing-
leads, it has been determined that fishing
varied then, as now, from simple shore-
fishing to that done at a depth of about
56C
Three types of boats seem to have ex-
isted through Norwegian history. One
was the dug-out of the lakes and rivers,
where seaworthiness was not the issue.
One such log boat found in Denmark
has been found to be from the later Stone
Age. Some double- and triple-log boats
have been found; they are thought to
have been used for ferrying cattle. The
best conclusion about the earliest seagoing
boats of the northeastern Norwegian
coast, is that they must have been skin-
covered, wood- or bone-ribbed boats. That
coast at that time was not forested, and
the driftwood, bone and sealskin used
were the most commonly available build-
ing materials of the culture. Further, only
a skin-covered boat would have both the
rigidity and the elasticity needed to with-
stand heavy seas. A bark canoe would
lack the former quality, and a log boat the
latter. Through the hundreds of years
when the skin boat was used, the all-
important keel was developed to the point
that a third kind of boat could be built
as forest lands appeared in Norway: the
clinker-built boat familiar to us in pictures
of the Vikings.
The boats of the Mediterranean were
carvel-built; that is, the planks were laid
on the hull-like flooring in a house. The
Norwegian boats, clinker-built, had plank-
ing overlapping as siding on a house is
overlapped. Other differences can be no-
ted between the Mediterranean ships and
those of the North: the former had round
sterns, while the latter were formed with
both bow and stern sharply pointed. Two
stern steering oars were used on the Med-
iterranean, while Northern ships employ-
ed only one, "placed on the starboard
quarter."
The Nydam boat, 77' long and under
11' wide, was discovered in 1865. The
coins found in it identify it as having
been built in 217 A.D. or slightly later.
It had 30 oars and would swamp on an
open sea, because the sides were so low.
Thousands of boats like this were built
between 200 and 500 A.D. for raids on
Britain. The Romans were forced to
build forts along the shore for protection,
and finally abandoned England because
the defense problem became so great.
"All Roads Lead to Rome"
By 30 B.C., Rome was the capital of a
huge empire stretching around the Medi-
terranean. Into all parts of this empire-
ran excellently-built roads. In general,
road-building commenced with the dig-
ging of two trenches, in one case these
were 62 feet apart and 4 feet wide. The
roadway which ran half-way between the
trenches was 18 feet wide, fitted of flat
slabs which were cemented together and
provided with a curbing. In some cases,
the original layers and repairs constituted
a road-bed three feet thick. At the 1950
price level, such a road would have cost
Americans about $116,000 per mile.
All in all, about 50,000 miles of road
were in existence at one time. Some of
the roads cross what is now the Syrian
Desert. In Britain almost a complete map
can be made of the roads the Romans had
built. Some of these are in such good con-
dition that they are still in use: the road
from Chester to Carlisle, Watling Street,
and the Great North Road.
Travel on Roman roads was better than
the world saw again until nearly 1500
years later. Tiberius traveled 200 miles
in 24 hours to be with a dying brother.
The journey from Rome to London took
only 13 days.
Although horseshoes were in existence
at that time, they cost too much for field
horses to be fitted with them for the little
bit of hauling they did at harvest time.
Consequently, wheat wagon traveled in
dirt tracks at the side of the paved roads.
The Romans were not the inventors of the
horseshoe; the invention is credited to
the inhabitants of Gaul about the time
of Julius Caesar. They were in use in
Britain before the Romans got hold of
any. We can see that present-day horses
are larger than those of Roman times
from the size of the shoes of that era.
Those shoes had six nail holes, and had
a wavy outline as a result of the holes
being punched into the hot shoe. They
were about four inches in diameter. In
northern Gaul and Britain a removable
leather shoe with an iron sole was used.
This was called the hippo-sandal, hippo*
being Greek for horse.
European Dark Ages: Northern and
Eastern Cultural Growth
The over-running of the Roman Empire
by various barbaric tribes ushered in a
period of comparative ignorance and
anarchy. History courses leave the impres-
sion that this was a time of stand-still or
back-sliding culturally. It seems to have
been a time when Europe, like a school-
child, was gathering knowledge rather
than being a productive member of the
society of continents. The 500 years just
past are characterized by a great spurt
of progress in pushing back frontiers of
knowledge and achievement. The so-called
Dark Ages were years when the cultural
background for these developments was
quietly gathered in Europe.
About 250 a.d. the Huns overran parts
of what was the Roman Empire; they
rode horses and seemed oddly at home
on them. The stirrup, which they intro-
duced, made the difference between an
unstable bareback ride and the glued-to-
their-horsc-s aspect of these barbarians.
The earliest known stirrups have been
found in a tomb in southern Russia, and
date between 100 B.C. and 400 A.D. Their
spread to China took place approximately

simultaneously with that to Europe, be-
ing accomplished by 400 a.d.
Legally, the Roman horses could pull
only specified, small loads. These Roman
horses were harnessed by a strap across
the breast; the strap tightened with pull-
ing, and a horse had a hard time drawing
a load and breathing at the same time.
The first pictures of rigid horse collars
appear about 900 a.d. in Europe, although
the invention may have occurred earlier
in northeatstern Asia. The improvement
was accepted very slowly.
Extensive export of precious metals has
not been a problem just in "modern
times: A patrician lady of the Roman
Empire wore silks that cost her nation
dearly, at the rate of several million Eng-
lish pounds per year. Across 4200 miles
as the crow flies—6000 miles as the
camels walked—Chinese silk was carried
westward. The Romans only knew that a
cloth called "serica" was produced by a
people known to them as Seres, and was
brought by caravan from far eastern Asia.
A camel driver by the name of Moham-
med lived from a.d. 571 to 632. He
dictated the religious writings of the wide-
spread Moslem faith and spurred to ac-
tion a people who became missionaries of
culture to Europe.
One example of this was the introduc-
tion, through conquest, of the Chinese art
of paper-making. By a phenominally rapid
growth, the Moslem world spread in 643
from the borders of India to Egypt. From
Egypt, the empire spread westward across
Africa to Gibraltar and through Spain
to the Pyrenees. Paper factories came into
existence under their rule, being estab-
lished by 900 in Egypt, 1100 in Morocco,
1150 in Spain. The next step needed
along these lines was not taken until the
German invention of the printing press,
300 years later.
Anyone who has watched sailboats on
a lake just before sundown, seeing the
low rays of the sun turn white sails
orange, owe a further debt to the Arabs.
The triangular, or lateen, sail was intro-
duced by the Moslems and had the great
advantage over the square sail of permit-
ting some progress against the wind.
There are two schools of thought about
48
the origin of the lateen sail. The Arabs
called it by that name, indicating they
thought it had a Latin origin. Thus, some
think it is an outgrowth of the Roman
artemon and its sail. However, others
argue that the lateen sail was found on
outrigger canoes by the first European
explorer, and that it must have originated
in the South Pacific. Some think there
was a common, intermediate starting point
from which the Arabs in 632 "carried the
ball" westward as they conquered Spain.
The Roman system of numbers, based
on the five fingers of a V-shaped hand,
is notoriously cumbersome. Again the
Arabs did the western world a service,
this time introducing the Hindu figures
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 0, as well as
the square root sign. The other operative-
symbols, + , —, X&gt; -T-. a"d =- arose
through shipping, storehouse, and other
commercial practices in Europe. But the
obviously superior Hidu numerals were
adopted slowly; they were outlawed as
"infidel" symbols in Florence as late as
1259 A.D. Their first known use in Eng-
land was for a rent roll in 1490. It is
hardly surprising that scientific investiga-
tion was not undertaken to any great ex-
tent in Europe until after the spread of
these numbers.
While this was going on to the south
and east of Europe, in the North the great
ship-building people again foraged into
England. About 793, these self-acknowl-
edged barbarians revisited the terrified oc-
cupants of the British Isles. They sailed
around Spain in their square-sailed boats;
they plundered Paris; they went overland
into Russia, building boats there and sail-
ing down the Dnieper and other Russian
rivers.
The sagas of the Northman tell us that,
about 800 a.d. a ship was blown off
course and Iceland was discovered. By
870, a colony was thriving there. It was
there that the quarrelsome Eric the Red
had a farm about 970. He was exiled for
his brawling, discovered Greenland, and
returned to his people, initiating the
colonization of that island. About 1000
his son, Leif the Lucky, set off in a 30-
oar boat like those of 300 or 400 years
earlier to explore the continent rumored
to exist to the west. He found land of
comparatively mild climate, forested and
overrun with vines, and called it Vinland.
It may have been he and his men who left
in northern Ontario the weapons of their
day, the weapons which first told us the
Norsemen had paid North America an
early visit.
The All-Important Horse
Shortly after this, the great age of the
horse took hold in Europe. Huge animals
were bred in Europe. Huge animals were
bred to bear the weight of a knight in
armour. This development is considered
to be a slow outgrowth of the invention
of the stirrup. This was the age of chiv-
alry, "cheval" being French for horse. It
was in this period that the Crusades were
waged, bringing about a small degree of
unification of horsemen of Europe at the
Pope's request that the Moslem be driven
out of Jerusalem. The attempt was not
lastingly successful, but ended in a peace
treaty negotiated by Richard of England.
This treaty was made in 1192, with the
understanding that Christian pilgrims

could come unmolested to the Holy Land.
During the years from 1100 to 1400
the major communication between local-
ized populations was maintained by the
packhorse—leading merchants and their
accompanying minnesingers. Whole
strings of pack-horses were led from
town to town, wearing such deep hollo-
ways that people on the surrounding plain
could not see horses passing by. There-
were a few four-wheeled carts, but very
few. A yearly fair, perhaps of a month's
duration, was held at or near each town,
and gossip was probably not the least im-
portant thing exchanged.
At these fairs were sold spices that
funnelled into Venice from the East
Indies, and out of Venice to the towns
of Europe by pack-horse. The spices were
used to make more palatable the vile
food of the day: Most people ate porridge
and bread, if the harvests were good. If
they were poor, acorns were the daily
fare. Even the rich had only tough and
stringy mutton or beef which had been
packed away between layers of salt since
winter's beginning. In 1300, the cooks
of the King of England used over
$1,000,000 of spices. Pepper was so
precious it was weighed with the windows
closed against stray breezes.
The familiar paper dollar has not been
around so very long: Marco Polo went to
the court of Jenghiz Kahn in China about
1271 with his father and uncle. He came
back marvelling at the paper money he
ha&lt;J seen made from mulberry bark, sign-
ed by the officials of the court, and print-
ed with the proper seals.
"A Sail, A Sail!"
Such was the joyous cry of the first
settlers on the eastern coast of this con-
tinent as they caught sight of their only
link to the homeland. The same kind of
three-masted ship was used by Columbus
and other explorers before and after him.
During the Middle Ages the lateen
sail had spread over the Mediterranean,
but the English still used a square sail in
1400. The Portuguese were the ones who
first started using two-masted ships, called
caravels. By about 1450, three-masts were
The greater part of the incentive for
this ship-building progress was the hope
of finding a sea-route for spice transport.
By 1504 this dream was fulfilled; all
spices, in effect, were transported by sea,
and the merchants of Venice were in sad
straits.
The Ascendency of the Stage Coach
As the rigid horse-collar slowly gained
in popularity, the horse began to replace
the ox as the plough animal. By 1500 the
horse was widely used, but it wasn't till
used, and were called "fore," "main," and
"mizzen." The last of these was named
from an Arabic word meaning adjustment
of balance. At first these ships carried only
square sails, but those used by Diaz and
Vasco da Gama carried lateen sails also.
Another improvement in ship-building
took place about 1200. This was the hang-
ing of a door-like rudder on the stern of
a ship, replacing the steering oars. The
Arabs were responsible for the introduc-
tion of the compass, first used by the
Chinese. Prince Henry of Portugal found-
ed a school of ship-building and naviga-
tion in 1418. It was this school which
fostered much of the progress in maritime
travel.
100 years later that the horse was regard-
ed as the usual plough animal. Lagging
this advance was the use of horses to draw
loads, a practice which developed to the
point that three ton loads were hauled in
open carts by teams of 8-10 horses.
In 1564, a Dutchman named Guylliam
Boonen introduced the closed coach to
England. By 1630, in the area within a
few miles of London, 6000 coaches were
in use. In 1650 the first stage coach run
was established. For many years, the detri-
ment to efficient coach service was rutted,
cuddey roads. As late as 1760, a 400
mile journey took 16 days, accounting for
a coach's being overturned or stuck sev-

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Among the many engineering problems relative to
designing and developing today's tremendously
powerful aircraft engines is the matter of accumu-
lating data — much of it obtained from within the
engines themselves — and recording it precisely.
Such is the continuing assignment of those at Pratt
&amp; Whitney Aircraft who are working in the highly
complex field of instrumentation.
•Pressure, temperature, air and fuel flow, vibra-
tion — these factors must be accurately measured
at many significant points. In some cases, the meas-
uring device employed must be associated with
special data-recording equipment capable of con-
verting readings to digital values which can, in turn,
be stored on punch cards or magnetic tape for data
processing.
Responsible for assembling this wealth of infor-
mation so vital to the entire engineering team at
Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft is a special group of elec-
tronic, mechanical and aeronautical engineers and
physicists. Projects embrace the entire field of
instrumentation. Often involved is the need for
providing unique measuring devices, transducers,
recorders or data-handling equipment. Hot-wire
anemometry plays an important role in the drama
of instrumentation, as do various types of sonic
orifice probes, high temperature strain gages, tran-
sistor amplifiers, and miniaturized tape recording
equipment.
Instrumentation, of course, is only one part of a
broadly diversified engineering program at Pratt &amp;
Whitney Aircraft. That program — with other
far-reaching activities in the fields of combustion,
materials problems, mechanical design and aero-
dynamics — spells out a gratifying future for many
of today's engineering students.

eral times. It was thought that narrow
wheels cut up the road-ways. The result
of this opinion was that coaches equipped
with 16 inch wide tires were allowed to
travel toll-free.
John MacAdam advanced a surprising
theory, that the thickness of a road-bed
need be determined solely by the thickness
required for good water-shed. In his road-
maintenance duties in England, MacAdam
specified that no stones over 1 inch in
diameter were to be used in his roads. The
result was a tightly packed road surface,
the first surface of such quality since the
time of the Roman roads.
Combined with the efforts of Mac-
Adam, were those of John Palmer, who in
1784 persuaded the English authorities
to change from post-riders to mail
coaches. Thus, after 1800, an extremely
efficient .stage coach system served the
English people.
Steam Carriage vs. Stage Coach
We occasionally hear even today of a
steam-powered automobile. At one time-
there was an excellent chance that the
steam carriage would attain the wide
popularity that the gasoline motor car has.
As early as 1801, Richard Trevithick had
invented a steam carriage in England. The
whole idea was so fearsome to the popu-
lace that one such carriage was complete-
ly wrecked by stones hurled at it in 1827.
Regular steam coach service was estab-
lished between Gloucester and Chelten-
ham in 1831. Speeds were improved until,
in 1864, a speed of 34 miles per hour
could be maintained.
This same year, the "Man and Flag
Act" was passed. This act, not repealed
until 1896, required that a man carrying
a red flag walk ahead of any mechanically-
driven vehicle. So the lid was effectively
clamped down upon steam carriage prog-
ress in England, and stage coaches con-
tinued in service.
The bicycle, now prevalent in European
cities and on some college campuses, orig-
inated in the form of a two-wheeled de-
vice, incapable of being steered, and
powered by the pressure of the foot on
the ground. This appeared about 1800
in France; a later development in the
same country provided the "hobby-horse,"
as it was later called, with a movable front
wheel. When introduced to England in
1818, these contraptions still were not
powered by a peddle, chain, and pulley
arrangement, and wooden wheels with
iron tires were used.
Steam Locomotives
Three men are considered to be out-
standing in the development of the steam
engine. The first, Savery, engineered a
steam suction pump in 1698. Newcomen,
another Englishman and a friend of Sa-
very's, designed a pump for mining use
on the piston and cylinder principle. In
1776, Watt, an instrument maker, intro-
duced the separate condensing chamber,
thus markedly stepping up the efficiency
of the engine.
In England during the year 1814,
George Stephenson built one of the early
steam locomotives for rails. By 1825, the
Stockton and Darlington Railway had
been formed for the purpose of hauling
coal. Stephenson built a locomotive for a
race that would maintain a speed of 29
miles per hour, and shortly after this, the
stage coach business folded up its tents
and stole away.
Before the advent of the steam loco-
motive, rails had been laid for wagons,
thus preventing sinking of heavy carts in
the mud and permitting the transport of
larger loads. Earlier, in some cases, than
Roman times, carts left tracks 4 feet 6 in-
ches apart. This size has come down
through the years without much change:
the standard railroad gauge is 4 feet 8]/'2
inches.
At first, it was thought that metal
wheels would slip badly on metal rails,
and the two were never used together
without meshing teeth. This has since
been found to be unnecessary. Another
early practice was that of putting the
flange on the track rather than on the
wheel. This was to permit the use of the
old horse-drawn carts on the same rail-
ways.
It is interesting to note that the first
air travel was begun about 1800, and was
balloon travel. This progressed through
the use of balloons for reconnaisance in
the United States' Civil War to the series
of catastrophes which helped to termin-
ate commercial dirigible service.
Steam-boats on the Mississippi
and on the Atlantic
In Scotland—the year was 1788—Wil-
liam Simington and Patrick Miller oper-
ated a wooden steamboat at five miles per
hour. Robert Fulton, of the United States,
was the first to operate a steamboat at a
profit, carrying both people and goods.
For several years the Americans in Ohio,
Kentucky, and the areas along the Mis-
sissippi had built flatboats to carry their
produce downstream. These 20 x 60 foot
boats took about 6 weeks to get to New
Orleans, but 20 or 30 men would take
four months to haul one upstream again.
What an improvement the first steam-
boats were on the Mississippi, about 1811.
In 1787, "Iron-mad Wilkinson" built
an iron boat, and it wasn't too long be-
fore many canal boats were made of iron

WITH THE WEATHER
Now they're not only talking about the weather, they do
something about it.
From the earliest times, weather has
affected the habits and activities of man.
It altered his means of land travel and
his methods of farming. When he raised
a crude animal skin over his hued-out
log, weather once again proved to be a
help or hindrance in this new medium.
Thousands of years later, weather fol-
lowed man into the third dimension
when the Wrights first took to the air;
and it has been with him in this realm
ever since. Today's aircraft has overcome
many of the problems associated with
weather, but there is still plenty of room
for progress.
Winds were the first of the weather
phenomena to plague man's efforts in
the air. In December of 1903, the Wright
brothers had to wait several days for the
wind to calm before they were able to
perform their historic feat. Several
flights were made across the Atlantic
from west to east, starting in 1919 with
the famed NC-4, but the first of the
flights in the opposite direction did not
take place until some ten years later.
This, of course, was due to the prevailing
westerlies common to the north tem-
perate latitudes. A modern occurrence of
this type took place during the summer
of 1954, when the pilots of American
Airlines went on strike protesting their
new working day. During that summer,
America placed their new DC-7 air-
liners in non-stop transcontinental ser-
vice for the first time in history. The
flight from west to east took about 7'/i
hours, which was fine for everybody, but
the flight in the opposite direction took
3t&gt;out 81/, hours, and the protest was
about that extra quarter hour, violating
the union's 8-hour working day.
Late in World War II, when the B-29
Superfortresses were staging their daily
strikes against Japan, they were often
bucking headwinds which were unbe-
lievably swift. To overcome these, the
pilots would open the throttle wide, giv-
ing the plane an indicated airspeed in ex-
cess of 350 knots. Yet, much to the dis-
gust of the crew, their relative ground
speed would often be negative—in other
words, they were flying backwards! These
planes eventually ran out of fuel and
were forced to ditch. The AAF lost more
B-29s in this manner than they did to
Japanese fighters. Today commercial air-
lines are using these winds, now known
as the Jet Stream, to speed their flights
from San Francisco to Tokyo.
Although winds with the velocity of
the jet stream will not seriously damage
military or commercial aircraft, this is
not true for light planes. For this reason,
the CAA (Civil Aeronautics Administra-
tion) will not allow light planes to take
off in winds exceeding 30 knots.
In the decreased temperatures of the
upper atmosphere where aircraft operate,
the aircraft and its components are seri-
ously affected. In light planes, the fabric
might tend to become brittle and tear,
but since these do not operate at such
great heights (seldom over 10,000 feet),
this is not too large a problem.
However, there is a somewhat greater
problem for metal aircraft which fly at
much greater heights. Tests have been
made on various aircraft metals at temp-
eratures down to -78°C. It was found
that the yield and tensile strengths, en-
durance limit, and hardness increase as
temperatures decrease, whereas the duc-
tility varies only slightly. The impact tests
were of a different nature. These are the
results:
Ferritic steel—lost great deal of re-
sistance to impact.
Nickle alloy and austenitic stainless
steels—not much affected and best suited
for high altitudes and cold areas.
Aluminum alloy—decreases resistance
slightly or not at all.
Wrought magnesium alloy—adversely
affected.
Cast magnesium-base alloy—not ad-
versely affected.
Although military and commercial air-
craft do suffer to some extent from rust-
ing and corrosion, their's is not half the
problem that confronts the owner of a
light plane whose surface is wood or
fabric. Tests were performed in Austra-
lia, in which two Anson-type wooden air-
craft wings were placed outdoors for
several months in two locations—Mel-
bourne (Lat. 38°) and Cairus (Lat.
17°). The former has a temperate, dry
climate, while the latter is hot and moist.
At Melbourne, with temperatures up to
60°C, the moisture content of the wing
increased 11% by weight, while at Cairus
it reached 20% at temperatures to 80°C.
In the latter case, the upper portion of
the span had decreased in strength by
more than 30%. There was serious de-
terioration, with the surface finish dis-
integrating badly and the casein glue
failed completely throughout the whole
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


structure. In many places, the brads used
in the plywood skin had loosened so they
could be lifted out with ones fingers.
And finally, mold growths are evident,
and the stench of decayed glue was most
objectionable. The wing at Melbourne
behaved in much the same manner, but
to a lesser extent because of the difference
in latitude.
Aircraft fabric doped with cellulose
nitrate absorbs only small amounts of
water at high humidities; the gain in
weight noted in a saturated atmosphere
was less than 12% of its weight in the
standard conditioning environment —
21°C. and 65% relative humidity. Fab-
ric doped with cellulose acetate behaves
similarly to fabric coated with cellulose
nitrate at relative humidities as high as
97%. However, at 100% relative humid
ity, it is much more hygroscopic and ab-
sorbs about 20% of moisture in one
week and 40-55% over a period of
weeks.
One atmospheric phenomenon which
terrifies many pilots and which is re-
spected by all, is that of aircraft icing.
The natural existence of cloud droplets
at temperatures below 32°F. in the at-
mosphere accounts for most of the ex-
ternal ice accretions on aircraft. Observa-
tions show that water will remain in the
liquid phase in clouds over a wide range
of temperatures below the normal freez-
ing point. These droplets are no larger
than 50 microns in diameter and are us-
ually 8-20 microns. Water droplets at
temperatures below 32°F. may also be
generated by normally operating com-
ponents. Consider clear air expanding

from a condition of near water vapor
saturation. Such a condition may be found
in the air stream that enters an engine
carburetor when the throttle is partially
closed. The geometry and flow pattern
are illustrated for this condition in Figure
1.
As nearly saturated air moves along
the stream with decreasing pressure, the
temperature decreases according to the
adiabatic process, and the total tempera-
ture at region 1 on the downstream side
of the throttle is substantially the same
as that of the ambient region O, until the
temperature of water vapor saturation is
reached. Where the flow degenerates to
a turbulent condition such as region 2,
the temperature of the gas particles is
substantially equal to the fluid in the
moving free stream at region 1. Because
of the velocity of the stream in this re-
gion and the time interval required for a
droplet to grow to a significant size, visi-
ble condensation may not occur near the
throttle in the moving stream but may
be seen at some distance downstream.
However, droplets may reach a sufficient
size to cause an icing problem, in the
separated regions 2, because of this com-
paratively stagnant movement through
these regions and because of greater time
interval consequently available for drop-
let growth. Under certain conditions, vor-
ticity may develop in the standing regions.
This will be conducive to the precipita-
tion of more water because of the re-
duced stream temperature within a vor-
tex. It can be assumed that the temp-
erature of the droplets so formed con-
forms closely to the stream temperature
and that in most cases, including the ex-
ample of the engine carburetor, the con-
tents of the air-borne droplets do not
undergo the phase change to ice until
mechanically disturbed as when the drop-
let strikes the walls of the carburetor. The
same is the case over the wing, except
that the high velocity of the plane pre-
vents the droplet from growing to a sig-
nificant size (See Figure 2). There are
five main factors on which depends the
rate of ice formation. These are: (1) the
liquid-water content of the icing cloud,
(2) the droplet size, (3) the size of the
airplane components, and (4) the shape
of the particular airplane component, and
(5) the relative humidity of the atmos-
phere.
Icing reduces the maximum lift co-
efficient and increases drag considerably.
The latter has been increased by 35%

"As I review the progress in aeronautics within so short a span, and marvel
at the complex aircraft of today, I call it an achievement little short of miraculous.
"Today, electronically-guided planes take off and land without human touch.
Lethal sky missiles seek and destroy invisible targets with uncanny precision. And still other
fantastic achievements in both man-controlled and pilotless flight are now in the offing.
"When men go to the moon and planets, electronically-controlled skycraft will take them
there. Aviation maps will be studded with stars as well as with cities. New developments
in aeronautics will go on and on. Success opportunities and careers will continue to develop
for ambitious young men in this exciting field where a new era is beginning!'*

and arresting barriers at the runway end.
Another problem with our present
strips would be fuel spillage. The present
jet fuel will "eat" concrete and softened
asphalt to the point where ruts will be
made by landing planes. Engineers are
also working on a paint that can with-
stand the heat. The present paint for lines
on the strip peels and cracks.
Another new aspect of the jet terminal
will probably be underground fueling
systems with hydrants on the field. The
jets will use the contents of several of
the conventional fueling trucks. Quick
turnoffs and a speeded up baggage and
passenger system will be needed to clear
runways as quickly as possible. The jet
requires 9000 lbs. of fuel to hold over
the field for one hour. The expense will
be too great for the jet to hold for the
maximum on any great number of trips.
Alternate airports are always bad for the
business and must be avoided as much
as possible. Therefore the ground crews
and the customer servicers must be trained
for peak efficiency.
Now that we have viewed the prob-
lems, let us view some of the jet planes
that will be our transports of the future.
N. E. Rhoades, United Air Lines man-
ager of flight engineers, said: "DC-8
takeoff will be somewhat conventional,
except quieter than usual for up-front
passengers.
"Initial rate of climb will be much
like todays planes until the DC-8 ac-
celerates to 290 kts., its best rate of climb
speed. From this point, rate of climb will
be 2,000 fpm or higher, depending on
the load. Low altitude turbulence will be
traversed in about two or three minutes.
"Plane will reach 30,000 ft. in 15 to
17 minutes. The heavy, long-range ver-
sion probably will level off between 25,-
000 and 30,000 ft. for first stage cruise
and after some fuel is burned to lighten
the load, the plane will climb to 35,000
ft. for final stage cruise.
"Climb to the 30,000-ft. altitude will
require about 1,200 gal. of fuel. Average
fuel consumption for cruise will be about
2,200 gal. per hour.
"Better methods will have to be evolved
to find jet streams when the plane is
traveling eastbound, and to avoid them
when westbound.
"Plane will pressurize from sea level
up to 23,000 ft. This will be an opera-
tional necessity in order to get passengers
down comfortably, since normal rates of
descent of the DC-8 may be from 4000
to 5000 fpm.
"Descent for straight-in landing will
be made from cruising altitude in 7 or 8
minutes.
"Passengers would have panoramic
view, unobstructed in most seats."
In July the Boeing 707 made its first
landing at a commercial airport. The
plane had previously landed at Boiling
Field, Washington, D.C., and at Offutt
Air Force Base, Omaha, in its role as pro-
totype of KC-135 jet tankers. At Los An-
geles Airport it picked up a 10 man
British evaluation team which had been
at Douglas Aircraft Co. in Santa Monica
to discuss possible purchase of jet air-
liners. The plane gave an indication of
its ability when halfway on its base leg
to the right runway of a parallel pair at
Los Angeles Airport, the tower ordered a
turnback to the lefthand strip. The huge
plane, with gear and flaps down, and
slowed to a baseleg speed of 160 kts.,
made a sharp, quick S-turn back to the
left runway with extreme ease despit;
its low air speed.
Landing at a gross weight of 152,000
lbs., with temperature in the high 80's,
the plane rolled 4000 ft. to a complete-
stop without heavy brake application.
Touchdown speed was 113 kts. The
plane has no thrust reversers but used
flaps, spoilers, and brakes to slow down.
The flight from Seattle to Los Angeles
took 1 hour 57 minutes for a block to
block speed of 440 kts. It flew at an al-
titude of 35,000 ft. bucking a headwind
of 70 kts. It took off from Seattle with a
gross weight of 179,000 lbs. with a 4000
ft. run.
The following evaluation was made by
the designers:
1. Footprint pressure very close to
that of todays DC-7 and Con-
stellation.
2. Holding pattern speed of 160 kts.
clean, and 140 kts. with 30 de-
grees of flap.
3. Traffic pattern speed very close to
that of current piston-powered
transports.
4. Final approach just one knot high-
er than the DC-6B.
5. Rate of descent of 14,000 ft. per
minute in case of cabin pressure
leak or decompression or other
emergencies.
6. Takeoff roll 9,600 ft. on a 100
degree day.
These characteristics are for the 707-
320 intercontinental model, with a tak:off
gross of 290,000 lbs.
Will the public accept jet airliners in
America after the disastrous experiences
of the Comet I, the English jet transport?
The men with the money seem to think
so, because already all the major airlines
have put in orders for jet airliners as
soon as they are available. The use of the
first commercial jet transport is due some-
time in 1959-
If early runs of the plane are success-
ful, the jet transport may well obsolete
most of our present commercial fleets,
but if they fail it may be a long time be-
fore the paying customers will ride the
jet transports.

thermoplastic insulations.
Natural rubber, including Laytex®,
GR-S synthetic rubber and thermoplastic
insulations are available in two classes,
depending on whether they are designed
for use in dry or wet locations. Standard
insidations, Type R and Laytex Type RU
(made from rubber) and Type T (made
from thermoplastic) are for use in dry
locations while moisture-resistant insula-
tions Types RW, RUW, and TW are for
use in wet locations. There are many in-
stallations, particularly in buildings, where
the less costly standard compounds give
entirely satisfactory service.
Natural rubber and CR-S synthetic rub-
ber insulations are also available in two
classes depending on the operating tem-
perature for which they are designed,
namely, Type R and RW for 60 C. opera-
tion and Type RH and RUH for 75 C.
operation. Conductors insulated with RH
insulation carry more current, that is, use
the conductor more efficiently than those
insulated with Type R insulation. There
is also available a combination insulation
capable of operating at 60 C. in wet loca-
tions and 75 C. in dry locations. Butyl
rubber insulation is suitable for operation
at 85 C. and silicone rubber for even
higher temperatures.
The thermoplastic insulations described
above are limited to 600 volts for general
power distribution. The rubber and rub-
ber-like insulations are limited to a maxi-
mum operating voltage of 5000. For opera-
tion at higher voltages where ozone is
produced in quantity, resistance to ozone
in the insulation must be provided.
Acceptable ozone resistance in rubber
and CR-S synthetic rubber insulations is
provided by incorporating in them rela-
tively high percentages of an inert chemi-
cally saturated compound such as
vulcanized vegetable oil. These are the so-
called oil base compounds. Compounds
made from butyl rubber are inherently
ozone resistant. Oil base and butyl com-
pounds are suitable for operation at a
maximum voltage of about 28 KV,
grounded neutral, when properly shielded.
Varnished cambric insulated cables are
generally used in the same voltage range
as ozone resistant rubber, that is, at a
maximum of 28 KV, grounded neutral,
and at a maximum conductor temperature
of 85 C. For use in wet locations varnished
cambric cables must be covered with a
lead sheath.
Impregnated paper-insulated, lead-
covered cables are suitable for operation
at voltages up to 69 KV at a maximum
temperature of 85 C. Cas or oil filled
paper insulated cables are suitable for
higher voltage services at somewhat re-
duced temperatures.
Insulation thicknesses for all insidations
depend on the rated voltage, the con-
ductor size and type of insulation. Mini-
mum insulation resistance and test
voltages have been established for all
classifications.

instead of wood. In 1822, an Englishman
by the name of Manby took an iron
steamer to France where it and others like
it were quickly adopted for river use. Iron
for ships was on the way in, but the
world had to be shown that it would
work.
In 1821, the first steam packets traveled
across the English Channel. By 1840,
Samuel Cunard had gotten government
one of a team of surveyors was killed,
and many workers were killed as the road-
bed was blasted in the mountainside. In
the United States, the first transcontinental
railway was completed in 1869. President
Abraham Lincoln signed the authorization
for its building in 1861 in hopes that
California would be encouraged to enter
the Civil War on the side of the Union.
By 1930, the United States had 260,000
subsidy for steamboat service to the
United States with the specification that
the ships must be of wood. In 1856, the
Cunard Line put on its first iron paddle
steamer, the Persia.
The years 1860-1880 were the age of
the iron sailing ship, which was cheaper
to build than wood. A further improve-
ment was made possible by the English-
man, Bessemer in 1856: He developed a
method of producing steel cheaply. This
encouraged the ascendency of steam power
and the consequent decline of sailing ves-
sels. In the year 1882 of the English ships
built, 55 were wooden, 100 steel, and 625
iron. The size and speed of steamers went
up by leaps and bounds: In 1875, the
Germanic was the first ship over 5000
tons. The Maurelania, in 1908, was near-
ly 32,000 tons, while the Queen Mary,
in 1934, reached 81,235 tons.
Miles of Railroad Track and
National Unify
The years between 1840 and 1850 were
great railroad building years in all of
Europe. The building of railroads in Ger-
many was nearly as effective as Bis-
marck's leadership in uniting that country.
In both the United States and Canada, it
became almost political necessity to com-
plete transcontinental railroads. The first
such in Canada, the Canadian Pacific, took
many lives as it was in the building. The
terrain was so riddled with precipices that
miles of the world's 750,000 miles of
railroad track.
The Motor-Car and the Airplane
A Scotsman, John Boyd Dunlop, in-
vented the pneumatic bike tire in 1888;
by 1896 there were 4 million bicycles in
the United States alone. In 1885, a Ger-
man, Daimler, patented the first success-
ful motor bicycle.
The same year Daimler and another
German, Benz, separately developed a
motor ear. The first American to build
automobiles was Ransome Olds, whose
first car was built in 1887. He was also
the first manufacturer of autos in the
country, starting in business in 1899. By
1904, 5000 Oldsmobiles were- sold per
year. In 1893, Henry Ford built his first
car, using pneumatic tires.
Henry M. Lcland adapted precision ma-
chining methods from the manufacture
of Colt revolvers to the production of
Oldsmobiles. Thus the first interchange-
able auto parts were made. In 1913 Ford
established the assembly line, employing
an overhead greased rail on which the
auto was at first pushed from station to
station by hand. By 1925, two million
Fords were sold in one year.
In 1809, Sir George Cay ley had sug-
gested in his book. On Aerial Navigation,
that airfoils, instead of flapping wings, be
used in future attempts at flight. Many
people had attempted planes before the
Wright brothers flew at Kittyhawk in
1903. Among the problems they had to
solve were these: Steam engines and their
fuel were too heavy for the power they
developed. The control of an object in
flight was subject to rules unknown ex-
cept by experiment, experiment that some-
times ended in fatal accidents. One of
these killed the German glider expert
Otto Lilienthal in 1896. There was a good
deal of correspondence among the people
who developed the principles of flight
to the point where the Wright brothers
could successfully fly their plane.
As we all know, progress is continu-
ally being made in the kind of vehicles
mentioned in this article. A quick search
of anyone's mind will cover balloon ascen-
sion into the stratosphere, dicsel locomo-
tives, an atomic submarine, automatic con-
trols, and faster-than-sound jet airplanes.
What lies ahead? Consideration of the
materials, processes, and power sources
under development may give some likely
clues as to the transportation of the
future.

system laboratory, which is just one part
of the overall expansion and building pro-
gram, represents the scope of the center.
The amount of fuel that must be supplied
to jet engines can be compared to the
amount of water flowing through a regu-
lation size fire hose, and at the rate the
average fire hose puts out water to ex-
tinguish a fire. Should all test cells in the

WITH THE WEATHER
(Continued from page )6)
under natural conditions in some cases,
and if ice forms on the control surfaces,
it may have an adverse effect on the con-
trol and stability of the aircraft. Ice on
the propeller blades, some with ice and
some bare, created asymmetry in both the
centrifugal and the aerodynamic forces
on the prop, causing a large amount of
vibration. In fact, to point out the amount
of dynamic unbalance possible, one pound
of ice thrown from the propeller blade
of a T-28 trainer at a distance of four
feet from the hub, while turning over at
1850 RPM, is equal to a force of 4700
pounds. If this ice is thrown from the
propeller and strikes some other part of
the aircraft, considerable damage could
result.
There are three main methods of elim-
inating the ice that accumulates on an
airfoil: (1) chemical, (2) thermal, and
(3) mechanical. The first depends on
the spreading of glycerin on some other
surface coating which will furnish a non-
adhesive surface, or lower the freezing
point of water. Except on props, where
the centrifugal action provides a spread-
ing force, the method has not been too
satisfactory, but is being steadily im-
proved. In the second category, the hot
exhaust gases provide adequate heat thru
ductwork to keep the surfaces above
freezing temperatures. The third consists
of inflatable rubber tubes attached to the
leading edge of an airfoil and are auto-
matically inflated to a pressure of 7
pounds per square inch, and then de-
flated, all in a period of some 9 seconds.
But, these should be used with extreme
caution when taking off and or landing
since they influence the aerodynamic char-
acteristics of an airfoil.
Formation of ice in the air induction
system of the aircraft engine impairs the
engine operation and sometimes alters
the fuel-metering system. Ice forms on
the inner walls of the air-inlet duct, the
screen, guide vanes, impact pressure tubes,
throttle plate and all other protuberances.
This is the most hazardous part of the
icing problem. During cruising opera-
tions, the manifold pressure may be
gradually reduced because of the closing
of the air inlet to the engine, or the en-
gine may suddenly stop when changes
in fuel metering result in non-combust-
able charges being drawn into the en-
gine cylinder. When the engine power
is reduced for the glide to landing for-
mation of ice in the throttle area may
be accelerated and prevent full power if
it be needed for further cruising or climb.
Jet engines are also subject to icing
unless equipped with anti-icing systems.
In axial-flow jet engines, ice forms on
fixed inlet screens and on compressor in-
let guide vanes. This tends to restrict
the flow of air through the inlet, and thr
result is a loss of thrust plus a rapid ris?
in exhaust gas temperature (tailpipe tem-
perature). As the airflow decreases, th:-
fuel-air ratio increases and the tempera-
ture of the gases to the turbine is raised
Flame-out will soon occur as the oxygen
is further restricted. Ice build-up on inlet
screens, heavy enough to cause turbine
failure, can occur in less than 60 seconds
when icing is severe. Even with the inlet
screens removed, the air passage between
the inlet guide vanes can be blocked in
four minutes under extreme icing condi-
tions. Inlet duct icing can occur without
the formation of ice on the fuselage and
wing surfaces. As intake air is sucked
into the engine compressor inlet, the air
temperature decreases; and the air at
above freezing temperatures can be easily
reduced to below freezing as it enters
the engine. The free moisture in the air
is supercooled, and causes engine icing,
even though there is no external evidence
of icing conditions. Jet engines protected

in 1911. There he received his B.S.E. de-
gree in Chemical Engineering in 1915
and his M.S. degree in 1916.
After his graduation, he was employed
as a metallurgist for the Studebaker Cor-
poration until 1918 when he began work-
ing for the United States Bureau of Air-
craft Production. The Packard Motor Car
Company was next to receive Mr. Jom-
iny's ability and he worked there from
1919 to 1921. Following his return to
Studebaker in 1921, he went back to the
University of Michigan campus to serve
as a research metallurgist until 1930 when
he went to work for the A. (). Smith
Corporation and The General Motors
Corporation.
Since 1941 Walter Jominy has been
under the employ of the Chrysler Cor-
poration, where he became Staff Engi-
neer. There, as in previous years, he
specialized in the field of ferrous metal-
lurgy with particular emphasis on the
heat treatment of steel and the study of
causes of parts failure. His varied efforts
in this field also include the writing of
purchase specifications of steel and cast
iron, the specifications of steel and heat
treatment for various automotive and air-
craft parts and the application of prin-
ciples of hardenability to the choice of
steel for industrial use.
Dealing with some of his extensive
study and research in the above field,
Mr. Jominy published several articles in
the scientific literature. These articles
were aimed chiefly at ferrous metallurgy.
Also, during Jominy's many years as a
research engineer, he developed the Jom-
iny test bar used in industry. It is a tri-
bute to his research in the testing of me-
tals.
Mr. Jominy has also done considerable
work on the metallurgy of the forging
operation, the proper selection, annealing,
machining and heat treatment of steel
for gears, the wear resistance of vari-
ous metals and alloys, metallic wear and
proper choice of metals and alloys for
wearing parts, and finally, the use of cast
iron for piston rings and cylinder blocks.
Among the recognition he has re-
ceived for his outstanding work, Jominy
was given the Sauveur Achievement Me-
dal and the Distinguished Service Award
of the American Society for metals.
In addition to being elected president
of the American Society of Metals in
1950, Mr. Jominy also is active in the
Society of Automotive Engineers and
American Foundrymen's Association.
This man who has spent over 40 years
in the field of engineering has offered it
much. His achievements serve as a goal
for many young engineers while his
contributions have without question,
played an important part in the overall
development which has brought the auto-
mobile and the airplane their present
status in the transportation field.

Standard's original delayed

cently celebrated its 25th

How to make an exception prove a rule
Technological progress is rapid in the petro-
leum industry. Few processes have a chance to
"grow old" on the job. Most are killed off through
the combined efforts of thousands of scientists
working constantly to improve everything we do,
make or use in our business.
Every now and then, though, we experience a
happy exception to this rule. That occurs when a
new development not only meets the immediate
need but also provides the right answer to situa-
tions yet unforeseen.
Twenty-five years ago last August a process
known as "delayed coking" was invented. The
new process made a quicker, cleaner job of con-
verting heavy residual oil into gasoline, gas oil.
and coke. It paid off spectacularly when catalytic
cracking was invented and these giant new units
began calling for feed. It paid off again when the
diesel locomotive came along to put the heavy oil
burning steam locomotive out of business.
Dr. Robert E. Wilson, chairman of the board of
Standard Oil today, was the inventor of delayed
coking. Almost all of the young scientists who
worked with him in its development are still with
Standard too, in responsible positions requiring
their special skills.
Young scientists in research and engineering at
Standard Oil today find it satisfying to see their
creative efforts translated into valuable product
and process improvements.

A LOOK
AT FUTURE
DESIGN
How to prepare for it
NEEDS for even more efficient ma-
chinery are daily presenting new
demands on the ingenuity of machine
designers. In the same way, products
themselves must incorporate even
greater economies in materials and in
manufacture to help keep pace with
the pressures of growing competition.
This trend in design thinking, there-
fore, poses a promising challenge to
the student engineer.
Rapid strides in the use of welded
steel construction point the way to a
brilliant opportunity to pioneer new
concepts in the field of product design
engineering. Fundamentally, steel it-
self is the most economical material
for many products, based on steel's
inherently high strength, rigidity and
low cost. The challenge, of course, is
how to utilize the steel to its maximum
advantage.
Here welding holds the answer to
new savings in cost of manufacture.
New welding electrodes, new welding
techniques being introduced almost
daily offer new avenues to obsolete
production methods of long standing.
Typical savings through the use of
welded steel are shown in the follow-
ing example.
All-wel do d heads tack for power drive
is made from 16 gauge sheet. Esti-
mated to be 20% more rigid, weigh
28% less, cost 44% less than cast iron
design. Photo courtesy Oster Manu-
facturing Company, Cleveland, Ohio.
It is to your advantage to keep pace
with the progress of welding tech-
niques. You can start with helpful
manuals and bulletins available to

by anti-icing systems and retractable in-
let systems are not susceptable to icing
hazards. However, on such engines,
screens should be retracted prior to take-
off, when potential icing conditions ex-
ist. Icing conditions must be extremely
severe for icing to take place in the cen-
trifugal compressor-type jet engine.
Another weather occurrence which
tends to give pilots prematurely gray hair
is the thunderstorm. Rapid surface pres-
sure variations occur during the first ten
to fifteen minutes of storm passage, and
this always results in altimeter errors.
This can cause an altimeter to read a
plus or minus sixty feet, and cases are
on record where it has read as much as
140 feet above the true altitude.
Besides turbulence, which will not be
discussed here, hail is probably the great-
est danger present in a thunderstorm.
Present day transport and military planes
are expensive pieces of equipment and on
occasion, a ten to thirty second encounter
with hail has caused damage severe
enough to warrant scrapping the aircraft.
Engine failure due to hail is extremely
rare, however; in fact, to date, there is
only one example on record. In this case,
a Lockheed Constellation experienced the
simultaneous failure of all four engines
and this was probably due to the block-
ing of the air intakes by hailstones. Min-
utes later, after the storm had passed,
the pilot restarted the engines, which were
apparently unharmed. Most susceptible to
damage are the leading edges of the
wing and tail and the engine cowlings.
Damage of the fuselage is usually con-
fined to the forward sections, that is the
nose and cockpit areas. Also very vulner-
able are turrets, radar coverings, antenna
loop housings, and landing and naviga-
tional lights.
The U.S. Weather Bureau has reported
that the most common width of track for
damaging hailstorms in the U.S. is from
one to two miles, and that although these
tracks may have a range up to 75 miles,
their average area is about 20 square
miles. It has also reported on the occur-
rence of various sizes of hailstones. The
following may give one some idea of
these relationships.
Size (dia.), inches Occurence
1 common
2 often reported
3 not extremely rare
4 doubtful
The CAA has conducted extensive
tests concerning hailstone impact on com-
ponents of DC-6 aircraft. Ice spheres
with diameters ranging from .75 inches
to 1.88 inches were employed at speeds
up to 804 mph. Here are some of the
results:
Windshield:
Glass-vinyl plastic laminated wind
shields using .125" plastic interlay-
er, resisted penetration by hailstones
at velocities up to 500 mph at 0°
slope, and up to 650 mph at 60°
slope. Full tempered glass sheets of
.25" thickness (front pane in
double-pane type aircraft installa-
tion), resist failure at speeds up to
230 mph at 0r slope, and 400 mph
at 60°. Methyl methacryolite sheets
of .25" thickness failed at about half
the speed at which the full-tempered
glass failed. "Safety-glass" with
0.109" annealed glass face sheets,
and 0.105" vinyl plastic interlayer,
is slightly stronger than the methyl
methacryolite.
Nose:
Thickness of fiberglass surface
membranes, .040". Honeycone inter-
layer (hexagonal cells), width, .25",
length, .32". Resisted penetration of
1.88" spheres at 380 mph to 480
mph, and with the line of impact
perpendicular to the radome surface.
The front fiberglass membrane pen-
etrated, but the rear of inner mem-
brane only bulged back without be-
ing torn or penetrated.
Wing Sections and Prop Dome:
Ice pellets less than .75" in di-
ameter caused minor damage. Indent-
ations were less than .1" deep in
.040" 75ST aluminum wing at
speeds up to 400 mph. At speed to
300 mph .045" 24ST aluminum was
comparable. The largest ice spheres
1.88", caused indentations .1" deep

sorb less neutrons which results in more
fission and consequently more heat in the
reactor.
In a slow reactor, heat is not concen-
trated as in the combustion chamber of a
turbojet. Heat increases more or less
uniformerly over the entire case of the
reactor. The heat transfer to the me'nl is
slowly increased. There is a further delay
in the transfer across the heat exchanger
into the air flowing to the engines. The
increased temperature of the air is not
felt at the engine until a short time la
ter. It first travels through the duct and
then brings the duct walls to an equili-
brium temperature.
All these things take time so there is
no immediate power increase such as for
saving a bad landing.
This lag causes two results. It demands
a very long runway for leisurely take
offs while power builds up and for land-
ing while power is decreased. Also, ad-
ditional thrust to shorten take offs or to
save bad landings cannot be immediately
had. The sea or a large harbor provides
a long runway.
A seaplane design would aho be the
best design when considering crash safe-
ty. In spite of attempts to safen the en-
gine with control rods to stop fission, a
crash could throw the rods out of the
pile. There would be no explosion be-
cause of subcritical radioactive mass, but
the heat produced would disintegrate the
engine. What would be left would be a
highly unapproachable for a long time
or perhaps never. This would be espe-
cially bad near cities. A crash at sea would
prevent radioactivity from reaching pop-
ulated areas.
Taken singly, design problems could
be solved. Eventually, it probably means
a new type of aerodynamic scheme. The
engine is such a big job, though, that
other items will be avoided. Summing up,
the design problem looks as if it could
be best solved by a flying boat or sea-
plane layout.
It appears, then that water based air-
craft, having returned from near ex-
tinction, will be the answer to some of
aviation's biggest problems of the fu-
ture.

tested by General Electric's Aircraft Gas
Turbine Division.
The plastic compressor blades were
used in five stages of a J47 compressor
rotor for the tests. Over 100 hours of
operating time were accumulated on the
experimental engine during the program.
Composed of a reinforced phenolic
resin, the plastic blades show very good
erosion resistance, are capable of operat-
ing continuously between 450 and 500
degrees Fahrenheit, and have excellent
stress characteristics.
While the blades operated successfully
in the J47, the 500 degree temperature
limitation precludes their use in advanced
engines where operating temperatures are
higher. However, if resins are developed
which can withstand the higher tempera-
tures, we feel that plastic blades may be
useful in the future.
The plastic blades weigh about 6
pounds less per compressor stage than
conventional steel ones, and manufactur-
ing costs appear to be only 25 per cent of
forged blade expense. Moreover, the use
of critical materials is eliminated.
Shorter than a man's arm and thinner than a broom stick,
this heater element keeps the Boeing B-52 control surfaces
free from ice.
New B-52 De-icer Developed
/ guess this is going to be an aero-
nautical issue—here's more airborne prog-
ress.
A compact, tubular heater developed by
the Westinghouse Electric Corporation
has proved to be the solution to an icing
problem in the Boeing B-52 tail surface
control system. Less than two feet long
and about as thick as a cigar, the Corox
element heater prevents the formation of
ice on this vital control mechanism as the
giant plane descends from high altitudes
to moist lower altitudes.
The heater fits inside a hollow extern-
ally-threaded screw that controls the ac-
tion of a hydraulic actuator. This actu-
ator in turn amplifies the force delivered
through the screw and moves the flight
control surfaces of the tail assembly.
These control surfaces are used by the
aircraft commander or pilot to maneuver
the plane in flight.
While directed and motivated electric-
ally by the pilot from the nose of the
plane, the threaded screw and actuator
are located in an unpressurized, unheated
rear section of the fuselage. The heater
insures instant operation of the screw and
actuator linkage by keeping these parts
always at a temperature above freezing.
Maximum heat per unit of weight with
minimum dimensions was the prime re-
quirement in the design of the heater.
Operating at 57.5 volts, the heater is
rated at 193 watts. It weighs less than
\y2 pounds. The heating section is 17
inches long and the tube is % inches in
diameter.
Once a young college female wrote the
editor of a correspondence column, "I'm
only 19 and I stayed out till two the other
night. My mother objects. Did I do
wrong?
The answer published in the paper the
next day: "Try to remember."
According to a story going around in
Western Europe, one Prague resident re-
fused to join the outcry against a new
Stalin statue in the city's public square.
"Why not a statue?" he said, "It gives
us shade in the summer, shelter in the
winter, and an opportunity for the birds
to speak for us all."

ACTIVITIES
Triangles
Triangles is the Junior honorary society
in the College of Engineering. It was
founded in 1917 for the recognition of
outstanding extra-curricular activities on
the part of Sophomore Engineers.
Being an honorary society, its main
purpose is to promote interest in activities
in the College of Engineering and in the
University as a whole. It also attempts to
perform services for the Engineering
school. As an example Triangles recently
purchased an oil painting of Professor
Kessler, who died several years ago.
They intend to hang the portrait in an
activities room in the new student activi-
ties building.
The members of Triangles must be of
Junior standing in the College of Engi-
neering and are tapped twice a year by
the active members. All membership ends
in the Senior year.
Engineering Honor Council
The Engineering Honor Code has long
been a mark of the integrity of the Mich-
igan Engineer. Since 1914 students here
have had the opportunity to study under
this Code and assume the responsibilities
which it offers—to be honest when judg-
ing ones self and others. To aid this
judgment, the honor Council was estab-
lished to function as a judicial and
educational body of students.
When violations of the Honor Code are
reported, either by students or the faculty,
the Council meets with those in question
to determine their guilt or innocence. The
student is helped to understand how and
why he has made his mistakes and is as-
sisted in correcting them. An individual
should know that he is not being punish-
ed unjustly; but that by violating the
Honor Code, he has harmed himself, his
friends, and his College. If he realizes
this, the student is not likely to repeat his
violation.
Besides the judicial function, it is the
Council's responsibility to make sure
every member of the student body under-
stands fully the principles of the Code.
Each year members of the Council speak
to incoming freshmen and transfers to
acquaint them with the Code and answer

bership each semester twelve outstanding

the Council booklet is revised to meet
new policy that the students wish to be
incorporated in the operation of their
Honor Code.
The Honor Council consists of 9 stu-
dents: 4 are chosen every semester for a
year term and one is appointed by Vul-
cans. The applicant fills out a petition
containing his reasons for desiring mem-
bership and possible means for improving
the Code. This petition is then discussed
during a 10 minute interview between the
applicant and the Honor Council. Any-
one with a 2.00 overall in the Engineer-
ing College is eligible for membership.
Petitioning dates are in December and
May, and notices will appear to that effect
on the Honor Council bulletin board in
the vestibule of West Engineering Build-
ing. There is a list of current Council
members posted on this board at all
times, so that anyone desiring more in-
formation can feel free to call.
To readily understand the great respon-
sibilities vested in the Honor Council, it
should be known that the body is en-
tirely student run and is not under direct
supervision of the Faculty. All decisions
are final unless an appeal is filed to the
Faculty Disciplinary Board. In the 41
years of the Council's existence, none of
its decisions has ever been reversed.
The Honor Council feels that it pos-
sesses among the most important and
valuable opportunities which Campus life
at Michigan offers. One cannot only gain
experience in judging people but also can
have the satisfaction of helping correct
the faults that can hinder them in later
life. Think seriously when considering a
campus activity and "PETITION YOUR
HONOR COUNCIL."
Each spring, from their den in the Union Tower, Vulcans Honorary
Fraternity comes to tap worthy junior engineers. Their secret mid-
night march proves every man worthy. The brick dust and axle grease
take many hours to scrub off.
Michigan Technic
The Technic is the oldest engineering
college magazine in America being en-
tered as second-class matter in 1881.
Though old and wise the Technic is
always in need of fresh ideas and new
blood. There is plenty of room for new-
comers.
Many students think that they have to
be a Sinclair Lewis or a Shakespeare to be
on the staff. Actually, although good
writers are always needed, there are many
jobs on the staff which require complete-
ly different types of talent. To mention a
few there are advertising, circulation, and
illustration. No matter what you're good
at, there's room for you at the Technic.
Another thing students fear is that it
will take too much of their time, but you
only spend as much time as you can spare
at the Technic and it never amounts to
more than a few hours a week. This little
time is well spent as you get much valu-
able experience on how to put a magazine
out, how to twist an article out of a pro-
fessor, and how to run a business. Then
at the end of the year there's a big steak
dinner. So let's see more people at the
steak dinner.
Sigma Rho Tau
Sigma Rho Tau is the national engi-
neering speech society organized 26 years
ago on this campus for the purpose of
helping engineers to learn how to ex-
press their ideas more effectively through
the spoken word. Since 1929 it has grown
to four chapters.
It is generally agreed among men in all
fields of business that engineers who are
able to get ideas across clearly are val-

Spectacular Beginning
of a SPECTACULAR STEEL
An electric furnace puts on a terrific show when we drop in a charge (as

later in service. For these are the high-alloy steels, stars of the metal

corrosion, heat, wear or great stress—or in providing special electrical
properties. • That may be the field you'd like to enter in your business life.

YOUR STEEL NOTEBOOK
The riffle barrel steel that makes hunting more fun
A .30/06 rifle can get heavier toward nightfall!
That's why a prominent gunsmith never gave up
looking for a new steel—one that would be lighter,
would machine readily, and yet would take the
enormous firing stresses of even heavier calibers.
o
Steels normally used for lightweight barrels gave
all kinds of trouble to the gunsmith: distortion,
poor finish, high tool costs, trouble with drilling,
reaming, rifling. They took this problem to Timken
Company metallurgists—and got the perfect
solution.
This TIMKEN® rifle
barrel steel is free
from internal stresses
Developed by the Timken Company, this new steel
(center barrel, in picture) made possible a rifle
barrel 6" shorter, 2 lbs. lighter than the previous
barrel of the same caliber (left). It withstands the
wear of thousands of rounds of firing. Machines
to highest accuracy—and to high finish beauty.
Machines without distortion. Drills, reams and
rifles perfectly. Proof tests to 70,000 lbs. per sq.
inch for safety in a .30/06. Has handled overloads
up to 100,000 lbs. per sq. inch. Timken Company
metallurgists are leading specialists in fine alloy
steels ... as this remarkable new steel will testify.

As another "Flunk the Frosh" cam-
paign begins, so again do the "Tech-
nic Teasers." Now after a long, cold
summer the reader should not be brought
into a state of shock by the first teaser;
so this one will be easy. Besides, the Tech-
nic can't compete with the professors in
the shock department anyway. So without
further ado here is another chance to
be sidetracked from your studies (be-
sides, no one works on them during the
day). Let us suppose that some civil has
become a successful contractor and wishes
to increase his equipment. Dump cars,
switches, and portable track sections cost
$90, $35, and $15 respectively. The num-
ber of cars is 4 fewer than the number
of switches, but both of these together
are only half the number of tracksections.
Since $1185 will put him in a lower in-
come bracket, how many will he buy of
each?
Now that you are thoroughly familiar
with the life of a civil grad, here's a
switch. During the summer an ME from
Chicago worked in the stockyards and
was given the following assignment. He
had nine pigs which he wished to place
in four pens, but it was also stipulated
that he should place an odd number of
pigs in each, but that each pen should
contain more than one pig. He claims he-
found a solution to the problem. What
was it?
Now add this one to your stock. A
certain baseball team used the following
men during the game: Anderson, Becker,
Brown, Black, Gray, Green, Jones, Smith,
and White. Highlights of the game in-
cluded:
a. With none out and the bases load-
ed in the first inning, Becker looped a
single to center scoring Jones with the
second run.
b. Black belted a grand slam homer in
the first.
c. Smith struck out to end the first in-
ning.
d. White sacrificed Brown to second
in the fifth.
e. With Anderson at bat in the fifth,
Brown stole third and scored after the
catch on Black's fly to left.
f. Neither Gray nor Smith was ever a
base runner.
g. The final score was 7-4. What was
the batting order?
If you struck out on the last problem
try this one. What number times 1,001
is itself repeated twice?
If once you get a lot of nothing try
again. Write 100 by using four 9's. While
on the subject of 9's, prove that a cat
has nine lives. It can be done.
Just in case you may be purring over
your successes to date try to substitute in
a digit for each letter in the ensuing div-
ision problem.

If you get the right numbers, when
you arrange the corresponding letters in
ascending order they won't spell a darn
thing.
In order to earn your letter, however,
you need to figure this next one out. This
one really should have your number. Giv-
en the following four propositions—
a. If a mathematician does not have to
wait 20 m/nutes for a bus, then he either
likes Mozart or else whiskey, but not
both.
b. If a man likes whiskey, then he
either likes Mozart and does not have to
wait 20 minutes for a bus, or else he does
not like Mozart and has to wait 20 min-
utes for a bus, or he is not a mathemati-
cian.
c. If a man likes Mozart and does not
have to wait 20 minutes for a bus, then
he likes whiskey.
d. If a mathematician likes Mozart,
then he either likes whiskey or has to
wait 20 minutes for a bus. Conversely,
if he likes whiskey and has to wait 20
minutes for a bus, then if he likes Moz-
art he is not a mathematician.
Under what conditions must a math-
ematician wait 20 minutes for a bus?
The following problem was composed
in 1860 (?) by a mathematician waiting
for a bus. There are two planes in New-
York and San Francisco respectively.
Each plane has just enough fuel to ne-
gotiate the distance between these two
cities. Now if they each fly to the op-
posite city having equal routes and equal
rates, which one will crash? It is, of
course, quite possible that you have heard
a similar problem before; so, lest some-
one accuse the Technic of lack of orig-
inality, the answer has been changed.
The professors have no monopoly on this
sort of thing. A full and complete dis-
cussion of this problem may be found
two issues hence.
The answers to these problems ex-
cept the last will appear in the next is-
sue. Meanwhile, phenyl salicylate (the
pharmacists call it aspirin) may be pur-
chased at your local drugstore.
In conclusion here is a passing thought:
A mathematician is a man engaged in a
legalized numbers racket.

supersonic propulsion
Marquardt, the leader
In supersonic propulsion, has
inaugurated a program of Individual
Professional Development for its engineers.
You can help us maintain this
leadership for the future of
supersonic propulsion.
I.P.D. gives our engineers a
chance to advance to their maximum
potential in their present fields... and
those beyond... in a climate of continuing
professional growth from in-plant courses
and more than fifty current courses in
Southern California's leading
universities. New courses are
constantly being added.
I.P.D. differs in its concept
and objectives from ordinary company
training programs in that it gives each
engineer an opportunity to grow and plan
his development toward his own goal
and at his own pace rather than
having to follow a rigid pre-
determined pattern.
I.P.D. is a part of an overall
expansion program which anticipates a
two-fold increase in personnel during the
current year. This increase represents many
additional engineering opportunities. You
can become a leader in supersonic

uable. The young engineer will find plen-
ty of opportunity to practice public speak-
ing ability both here at the University and
in intercollegiate contests.
This semester with an eye to fostering
interest in speech activities in the College
of Engineering, Sigma Rho Tau will con-
test with prizes of $25, $15, and $10. The
contest will be open to any interested
freshman engineer and will take place
during the week of December 6.
Sigma Rho Tau hopes to impress upon
the young engineer the importance of
skill and mastery in speech as well as the
slide rule. Engineers must be able to com-
municate convincingly in daily contacts
with co-workers.
The alpha chapter of Sigma Rho Tau
welcomes the freshman engineering class
to the University of Michigan and cor-
dially invites them and any other mem-
bers of the engineering college to attend
their Tuesday night meetings.
The Engineering Council
In order to coordinate the effects of
the many technical societies and class or-
ganizations and to unify and direct stu-
dent effort and opinion in matters affect-
ing all engineering students, some sort
of overall student governing body is nec-
essary in the Engineering College. This
need is filled by the Engineering Council,
a group composed of the presidents of
the major technical societies, the presi-
dents of the class organizations, and the
chief officers of other prominent organi-
zations (including the Michigan Tech-
nic) in the Engineering College. Each
spring, in addition to the membership
outlined above, the Council chooses five
"Members-at-Large" to serve for one year
terms. Any student scholastically eligible
may petition, and underclassmen are par-
ticularly encouraged to petition, for one
of these posts.
Foremost among new Council projects
planned for this fall is a student opinion
poll to evaluate teachers and teaching
methods in the College. In this and other
activities the Council attempts to work
closely with both the college administra-
tion and faculty groups; so that effort is
not wasted chasing tangents, and so that
what is done has maximum value and
meaning for administration, faculty, and
students.
This is a necessarily brief resume of
what the Engineering Council has done
and is doing. Every engineering student
owes it to himself and to his classmates
to support his technical societies and class
organizations and, through them, to sup-
port the Engineering Council. The serv-
ice that the Council can render is di-
rectly proportional to the support it re-
ceives.

INDUSTRIES THAT MAKE AMERICA GREAT
STEEL...
WHEREVER YOU TURN
Abundant, durable, versatile and compara-
tively cheap, steel in its many carbon, al-
loy and stainless forms is the most useful
of all the metals at man's disposal. Un-
known in nature, steel had to be created
by man's ingenuity, from iron ore and
other available natural materials.
Today, an estimated 1 Vx billion tons of
steel are in use in this country. With a
capacity of about 125 million net tons a
year, American steel mills can produce
close to half the world's annual total. Used
for everything from buildings to pins, the
total applications of steel are almost count-
less; // is virtually impossible to find a
product that does not depend on steel for
its production or distribution, or both.
Steel's steady growth reflects the impor-
tance of its contributions to America's
greatness. Much credit must go to the in-
dustry itself, which did not hesitate to exe-
cute a bold post-war capacity expansion
program of more than 28 million net tons
at a cost of nearly 6 billion dollars. The
steel companies are carrying on an inten-
sive two-fold program to develop new
sources of ore. While spending hundreds
of millions of dollars to open fields in
Labrador and elsewhere, they are also in-
vesting heavily in engineering develop-
ments that wiM make it possible to use
domestic low-grade ores such as taconite.
Interwoven with the history and progress
of steel is the development of steam gen-
eration for power, processing and heat.
B&amp;W, through the applications of steam,
has long been a partner in the vital, steel
industry—has brought to it boiler building
experience covering almost a century, built
on the results of a continuing, intensive
program of research and engineering de-
velopment. In steel as in all industry,
improvements in steam generation will
continue to make genuine contributions
toward still better products and services.

at speeds about one-half the velocity
of the .75" diameter spheres. The

um treated to 61ST had these vari-
ous sized pellets thrown at it at 300
mph; the indentations varied from
.14" to 1.33".
Although considered last, rain is by
no means the smallest of the present day
pilot worries. Twenty years ago, rainfall
was disliked by pilots mostly because it
created an area of low visibility. But to-
days pilot is even more wary of it, since
it will actually damage his craft as he
wings across the sky at speeds several
times greater than his counterparts of
several years back. The biggest problem
involved is that of erosion, during flight
through rain, of coatings, structural plas-
tic and metal parts on the exterior of
high speed aircraft. Actually, the first
reported cases of such erosion of air-
craft occurred in 1945. Since 1946, under
Air Force sponsorship, the Cornell Aero-
nautical Laboratory, near Buffalo, N.Y.,
developed a facility to test the behavior
of materials subjected to rainfall at high
speeds.
Test data was taken mostly at 500
mph speeds and one inch per hour sim-
ulated rainfall on various metallic and
non-metallic aircraft materials, using the
rotating-arm erosion apparatus. This con-
sists of a set of blades that rotate at speeds
ranging from 500-750 mph in a hori-
zontal plane through simulated rainfall.
Test specimens of airfoil shape are at-
tached to the blade. These are plastic,
glass, or metal, and may be tested with
or without coatings. The nominal vel-
ocities given refer to the center of the
specimen.
This test apparatus does not exactly
reproduce the amount of erosion experi-
enced during the same time interval as
one obtains under actual service condi-
tions. However, data on actual flight
tests indicate that it does rate materials
in the relative order of their service dur-
ability. In general, it has been found that
metals resist erosion much better than
plastics; however, in such aircraft struc-
tures as radomes, metals cannot be used
for obvious reasons.
Tests on subsonic aircraft flying
through a rainstorm indicate that the
raindrop erodes paints, plastics, and me-
tals on the leading edges in such a man-
ner that these surfaces appear as though
they had been sandblasted. It is to be
noted, however, that the erosion of most
metals is less severe than plastics. The

problems of obtaining materials which
will resist erosion for long periods of
flight through rain is still to be re-
solved. Investigation of many substances
under simulated high speed flight through
rain have not been satisfactory in that
they reveal few materials likely to with-
stand rain erosion for any appreciable
length of time. In order to aid in the de-
velopment of a satisfactory material, a
study of the mechanics and characteristics
especially pertinent to rain erosion is be-
ing made in the hope that increased
knowledge may serve as a guide both in
the search for, and design of, better ma-
terials.
Glass reinforced polyester resin lam-
inates have been found to be suitable for
housing radar equipment while still main-
taining the smooth exterior contours of
modern high speed aircraft. The uncoat-
ed laminates have very low rain erosion
resistance, however, and must be covered
with a protective coating. Of all plastic
and elastomeric materials tested to date,
neoprene formulations possess the best
rain erosion resistance at speeds up to
500 mph. To be more specific, Gaco neo-
prene coating N-79 and Goodyear neo-
prene coating 23-56, when properly ap-
plied with Bostik 1007 primer, fill the
bill as well as any presently in use.
A ten mil coating of either of these
neoprene materials over glass fiber rein-
forced laminates can be expected to re-
sist rain erosion for approximately l\/2
hours at 500 mph in a one inch per hour
rainfall. Even though these show con-
siderable improvement in rain erosion
resistance over coatings evaluated a few
years ago, new aircraft developments de-
mand even greater erosion resistance. As
the speed is increased, a new problem is
encountered—the heat generated by fric-
tion adversely affects the rain erosion re-
sistance of most elastomeric coatings.
High-temperature resistant coatings must
be used under these conditions.
Such are some of the problems en-
countered by man when he dons wings
and takes to the air. However, he has
survived and will continue to improve
this means of travel, as he has done in the
past. This can only be accomplished by
research, study and tests.

The Department of Engineering Mechanics serves a two-fold purpose in the College
of Engineering. It provides training in elementary mechanics for the professional cur-
ricula in the college and in addition it offers both undergraduate and graduate degree
programs in the broad field of applied mechanics. These programs afford an oppor-
tunity for development and training in both the classical and modern aspects of such
subjects as elasticity, plasticity, dynamics, vibration analysis, fluid mechanics and con-
tinuum mechanics. The integration of fundamental research activities with formal train-
ing develops men trained in science and engineering who fulfill the demands of the re-
search centers throughout the country. Many of its alumni have risen to positions of
prominence and responsibility in research, development and teaching endeavors and,
like other engineers, many have found their way into management and ownership.

Vulcans is the senior engineering hon-
orary for men. It was founded in 1904
for the purpose of recognizing achieve-
ment in scholastic and extracurricular ac-
tivities. The membership totals about 20,
with men being tapped in their senior
year.
Vulcan activities center around the
chapter room which is located in the
Union Tower on the fifth floor. Since the
group consists of seniors who are active
in other organizations, it is natural that
a great deal of time is spent in discuss-
ing problems and projects for both the
Engineering School and the whole cam-
pus. However, since the group is an Hon-
orary, no public stand is taken on any
issue.
Vulcans are also a service organization
having in the past done charitable work
for hospitals and providing support for
the Honor Council. At the present time
there are Vulcan funds set aside for a
scholarship and to help other groups who
are in need of temporary assistance.
The Vulcan social calendar is an im-

speaks from experience when he says:
At U. S. Steel one has a great amount
of varied experiences.
There is truly never a dull moment."
After receiving his B.S. in Mechani-
cal Engineering in 1947, Mr. Beattie
entered the employ of U. S. Steel as
a student engineer. That was on Sep-
tember 22,1947, and included service
in the United States Navy from 1943
to 1946.
Mr. Beattie's progress from that
date onward is typical of that of
many engineering graduates who
plan their future with U. S. Steel.
For, within two years, we find Mr.
Beattie advanced to the position of
Process Engineer, Maintenance De-
partment. Then on April 16, 1951,
he was promoted to Relief Foreman,
Shops, Maintenance Department.
On March 1, 1952, he was made
Turn Foreman, Blooming and Bar
Mills, Mechanical Maintenance De-
partment. And on January 1, 1955,
he was promoted to his present post
of Assistant Superintendent, Main-
tenance Department, of U. S. Steel's
National Tube Division's National
Works.
In this position, Mr. Beattie's re-
sponsibilities are numerous. They in-
clude the Service Power House and
Skelp Mill area; maintenance of
four blast furnaces and blast furnace
auxiliaries, plus a sintering plant;
maintenance of two blooming mills
and soaking pits; maintenance of one
bar mill; maintenance of three Bes-
semer converters, three open hearth
furnaces, three open hearth auxili-
aries, and seventy overhead cranes
ranging from two to 200 tons. He
supervises 680 men.
As Mr. Beattie remarks: "A steel
plant includes all departments . . .
every craft known to industry. In
the space of three years, a U. S. Steel
engineer can obtain experience that

SOVIET EDUCATION
The new Moscow State Univer-
sity. Thirty-two stories high, it
is reputed to be Europe's larg-
est building.
I had been living in Helsinki, Finland
for almost a year when, in the middle of
June, 1956, I was asked to give a mathe-
matical address at the Third Congress of
Soviet Mathematicians to be held in Mos-
cow beginning June 25, 1956. The meet-
ing was similar in character to one of our
national conventions of scientific societies;
professors gathered from all parts of the
Soviet Union to listen to the latest re-
search developments in all fields of mathe-
matics. Since the Congress was the first
such convention in over twenty years, the
organization committee decided, at almost
the last minute, to invite about forty for-
eign mathematicians, whose research was
of current interest to Soviet mathe-
maticians. All expenses for the foreign
mathematicians, except travel, were to
be borne by the Soviet Academy of
Sciences; my travel expenses were later
paid by the Guggenheim Memorial
Foundation. My visit in the Soviet
Union lasted seventeen days. The luxury
of the accomodations and the food, to-
gether with the nature of the official re-
ceptions and entertainment provided, indi-
cated that the invitation of foreign schol-
ars—particularly from the West—was a
special occasion in the Soviet Union.
It is interesting to note that in Moscow
I met for the first time the only other
mathematician from the United States,
Professor N. E. Steenrod of Princeton
University, who, incidentally, was once at
the University of Michigan. In addition,
one of the mathematicians from Red
China, now a professor at Tsing Hua Uni-
versity in Peiping, had studied in Ann
Arbor and asked about several of his old
professors here.
The mathematical meetings were held
in the Lomonosov State University of
Moscow, a new 32-floor building given
over to the science faculties of Moscow
University. The program of the Congress
was quite strenuous, particularly for the
foreign guests. From nine in the morn-
ing until six or seven in the evening there
were mathematical sessions for lectures
and reports, and on those evenings when
there was no official reception or banquet,
some sort of entertainment was arranged.
In my own case, I was taken three times
to the ballet at the Bolshoi Theatre, to a
recital by the American tenor, Jan Peerce,
whom I had never heard, to a three-di-
mensional cinema, a complete tour of the
Kremlin and the tomb of Lenin and
Stalin, the military airshow at the Tushino
airport, the Tretiakov art gallery, etc.
There was an all-day streamer excursion
down the Moscow-Volga waterway, and,
following the Congress in Moscow, the
foreign delegates were treated to four
days in Leningrad; the highlights of this
visit were the big astronomical observatory
of Volkovo and the Hermitage museum.
Wherever we went, we were able to roam
the streets unaccompanied at any time and
to talk freely to whatever people we met,
so that, in this respect, Moscow and Len-
ingrad differed very little from other
European cities.
In the course of conversation with Rus-
sian workers whom I met on the streets

or in the subway and with Russian mathe-
maticians at the Congress, it was quite ob-
vious that the political terror still exists,
despite the recent deemphasis of the Stalin
personality, and that personal liberties of
certain kinds are sharply curtailed. In
addition, the standard of living (not only
from the American point of view, but
also from the European) is not enviable.
The essential things such as food and
rents, seem to be adequately covered by
the salaries of the ordinary workers, but
clothing and consumer goods are pro-
hibitively high because of the high pro-
portion of industry devoted to the produc-
tion of arms. One noteworthy exception
is the cost of materials related to learning
and culture, e.g., books, phonograph
records, etc.
In vast areas the Soviet Union is unde-
veloped, and the industrialization of the
parts already developed is by no means
complete. To accelerate such a develop-
ment—both agricultural and industrial—
the Soviet Union has undertaken a pro-
gram of technical education which, in its
size, is without parallel in history. I wish
to describe here certain aspects and prob-
lems of this educational program, both
from my point of view as a scientis* and
educator, as well as from the point of
view of several Soviet scientists and edu-
cators with whom I discussed these prob-
lems.
One of the strongest contributing fac-
tors to the success of the Soviet edua-
tional system is the Russian students
desire for a higher, specialized education
which leads not only to a considerably
higher salary, but also to a respected po-
sition in Soviet society. For example, i
professor of mathematics receives almost
ten times the salary of an ordinary fac-
tory worker, while certain outstanding
professors in the Academy of Sciences
receive almost twenty-five times the work-
er's salary. The social status—and the
salary—of a science teacher in the schools
exceeds that of a medical practitioner,
although the research man in medicine
has the status of the scientist.
Students at the universities who make
normal progress are paid regular sums
each month by the state; the amount dc
pends on year of study and the type ol
institution, and the sum is usually suffi-
cient to pay for the student's room and
board. Students whose work is judged to
be excellent are awarded another 25 per
cent of their grant.
The curriculum in the secondary schools
—let us say, up to the age of 17 or 18—is
standard, and everyone takes the same
courses; as in other European countries
there has been no compromise with the
fact that knowledge is obtained only
through study. From the ages 14 through
18 everyone takes mathematics, physics
and chemistry as well as Russian, history,
and foreign languages. A thorough ex-
amination in all these subjects determines
which of the students go on to higher
Arthur John Lohwater, Assistant Professor of Mathematics,
was born in Rochester, New York. He attended the University of
Rochester receiving his Bachelor of Arts in 1943, his Master of
Science in 1946, and his Doctor of Philosophy in 1951. He also
did graduate work at the University of Columbia from 1947
through 1949.
Assistant Professor Lohwater has taught at the University of
Michigan since 1949- In 1955 he won both the Fulbright Fellow-
ship, which enabled him to study in Helsinki, Finland, and the
Guggenheim Fellowship, which supported him with funds to
travel through Europe. While traveling through Europe this past
summer, he attended an All Soviet Mathematical Congress in
Moscow, Russia.

education. By means of these examina-
tions and by means of the financial aid
given to students at the institutions of
higher learning, the Soviets have taken a
large step to assure themselves that no one
who is capable of some contribution by
means of a higher education will be over-
looked.
An idea of how much the educational
system has expanded between 1914 and
1952 is given by the following figures.1

learning in England and France. Today,
the enrollment has increased from 7952
by something of the order of 50 or 60
percent.2 How has this sharp increase
in enrollment affected the quality of the
finished product, particularly the new
Soviet scientist?
In America we have suffered certain
growing pains since the Second World
War both in the public school and the col-
leges. We have witnessed a frightening
drop in standards both in the material
taught in the public schools and colleges,
as well as in the admission requirements in
all but a handful of colleges. We have
seen the advent of remedial courses in our
colleges where freshmen are taught read-
ing and writing, Arithmetic, Elementary
algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. In
London I discussed the problem of the
Fulbright Commission there which had the
embarrassment of having American gradu-
ate student Fulbright winners denied ad-
mission to one of Britain's most famous
universities because of an appalling lack
of preparation. More pertinent to the sit-
uation being described here, we have
heard the alarm sounded that last year the
Soviet Union produced twice as many
engineering graduates as there were pro-
duced in America. Many university presi-
dents and deans have used this bit of
news to assert that, for patriotic and other
reasons, they were now willing to accept
additional funds from legislatures and
donors in order to enlarge existing uni-
versity plants to accommodate more stu-
dents. Unfortunately, it happens all too
often that, when the existing plant is in-
creased, the university must then round up
more students to fill the new dormitories,
either by accepting the applications of
students who would never have been ac-
cepted previously, or else by an extended
system of soliciting students in the high
schools.
Our expanding technology—as well as
that of the Soviet Union—demands more-
personnel: from the highly specialized
scientist engaged in research and develop-
ment down to the worker who carries a
blueprint from one office to another.
Should these people all receive the same
technical training in an engineering col-
lege? Is there a line depending on intel-
lectual capacity and achievement separat-
ing this wide spectrum into two groups
such that those below the line would bene-
fit more from an apprenticeship on the
job than from a specialized technical
training? What is the effect on students of
superior intellectual capacity of being pre-
sented an intellectual training geared
down to the level of students who are
not capable or not interested in receiving
it? It is not my intention to discuss these
questions which are still under consider-
able debate among educators; I will re-
mark only that the two great American
engineering institutions, Massachusetts In-
stitute of Technology and California In-

SONAR
by DR. JOHN M. IDE
Scientific men have always been called
upon to use their inventiveness and special
skills to assist military operations. Archi-
medes helped the defenders of the Greek
City of Syracuse when the Romans in-
vaded it, and Leonardo da Vinci made in-
genious mechanical inventions to assist the
warring Princes of Renaissance Italy. The
new weapons whose evolution can deter-
mine the course of war today are primar-
ily the products of science, as indeed we
should expect in an essentially scientific
age.
Undersea warfare, pro and antisub-
marine, is no exception to this trend. In
World War II German technology forged
ahead with improved U-boats, adding
high-speed and snorkel operation. This
campaign was countered by our direction-
finders and microwave radar, new sonar,
and sonobuoys, all products of American
science.
In 1943, when it began to be evident
that the course of the war was altering in
our favor, Grand Admiral Doenitz wrote,
"For some months past the enemy has
rendered the U-boat war ineffective. He
has achieved this objective not through su-
perior tactics or strategy but through his
superiority in the field of science."
When he wrote these words, Admiral
Doenitz was thinking primarily of anti-
submarine warfare. Undersea warfare is
today the U. S. Navy's most important
area of responsibility for defense. No
difficulty is expected in maintaining con-
trol of the surface of the sea in time of
war, but the operations of enemy sub-
marines are something else again. Twice
within recent memory U-boat warfare has
almost severed the life line of supply to
our allies and our own expeditionary
forces.
An additional danger, the potential
threat of enemy submarines approaching
our shores and projecting guided missiles
at our coastal cities from relatively safe
positions off-shore, must be added to the
danger of U-boats striving to interrupt the
traffic on the sea lanes. There is no reason
to doubt that our possible enemies have
inherited all the Germans' knowledge of
submarine technology plus the services of
well-informed technicians. Even the use
of nuclear propulsion, pioneered by us.
cannot be expected to remain a United
States monopoly. Gains in submarine de-
sign, unknown to us, may well have been
made by other nations since 1945.
"Sonar"
Although many branches of science
and engineering contribute to our prepara-
tions to cope with future undersea war-
fare, where submerged submarines are
concerned the most valuable and neces-
sary techniques are derived from the study
of underwater acoustics. Systems whereby
underwater acoustic energy is used for ob-

serration or for communication are known
as "sonar" systems. The word sonar is
also used to designate the principles and
practices employed in the design and op-
eration of these systems. The word itself,
coined as a running mate to "radar,"
seems to have been derived from the
phase "SOund, Navigation, and i?ang-
-ing."
These equipments embody applications
of underwater sound for (a) observation
and detection of other craft, whether they
be friend or foe; (b) determination of
position of such craft (range, bearing, and
bearing rate are the quantities usually-
sought); and (c) communication with
other craft for various purposes.
Depth sounders, for measuring the
depth of water beneath vessels at sea,
make use of similar acoustic principles,
but are not usually thought of as sonar
equipments. They are, however, the only
devices employing underwater sound nor-
mally to be encountered on commercial
vessels. Thus sonar is almost exclusively a
concern of the armed forces, primarily the
Navy.
Sonar systems are widely used by the
U. S. and other navies of today, appropri-
ately designed equipments being installed
in destroyers, escort vessels, submarines,
cruisers, and aircraft carriers. Sonar sys-
tems have been designed for operation
from helicopters, seaplanes, and lighter-
than-air craft, and even for use by am-
phibious forces and by "frogmen."
Active and Passive Sonar
We are accustomed to distinguish be-
tween active and passive sonar, referring
in the first case to equipment in which
bursts of sound are generated and trans-
mitted in the hope of receiving an an-
swering echo, and in the second case to
devices which are essentially sensitive
receivers for whatever sounds may be
present. Thus, a destroyer uses active so-
nar to echo range on a possible submarine
contact, whereas the submarine uses an
array of hydrophones to listen to the de-
stroyer's propeller sounds.
Active sonar is easily applied to give
both range and bearing of targets within
range. Passive sonar, sensitive to much
longer ranges, normally provides infor-
mation on bearing and bearing rate. It
can, however, distinguish between many
targets when there are several vessels in
the area at the same time. Passive de-
vices also have the sometimes critically
important characteristic that they obtain
information without making telltale
sounds or giving away the presence of
the receiving vessel. The most widely
used submarine sonars are passive sys-
tems.
Passive sonar, in its simplest form, has
been with us for a long time. Leonardo
da Vinci, near the end of the 15th cen-
tury, made the following entry in his
scientific notes: "If you cause your ship
to stop, and place the head of a long tube
in the water, and place the other extrem-
ity to your ear, you will hear ships at a
great distance from you." Much refine-
ment has taken place in the intervening
450 years with respect to the devices at
the head of the tube, in the tube itself,

and at the extremity near the ear.
Passive sonar is well adapted to use
in submarines, because of their relative
quietness, and poorly adapted to surface
vessels. The latter, operating at any sub-
stantial speed, simply make too much
noise to permit effective listening. Ex-
ceptions were the sailing vessels equipped
with hydrophones which patrolled the ap-
proaches to New York Harbor during
1943—44, and the German cruisers which
at critical moments had operators listen-
ing on their 20-ft. hydrophone arrays to
alert the bridge on the approach of British
torpedoes.
Tracing briefly the development of pas-
sive sonar arrays for submarines, we
should mention the early use of hydro-
phones by the U. S. Navy back in the
1920's. Our submarines were equipped
with blisters containing groups of carbon
button hydrophones. Incoming pulses
were fed through delay lines to a com-
pensator, giving target bearings accurate
to a few degrees. The Germans had some-
thing similar at about that time which de-
veloped by World War II into the so-
called GHG equipment (group listening
sonar), the hydrophones for which were
arranged in the shape of a horseshoe
about 5 feet across, and enclosed in a
blister transparent to sound.
The Japanese copied the German con-
cepts closely in their submarine sonars.
The U. S. Navy did not pursue this type
of device further at that time because
the state of the art did not then permit
constructing sensitive hydrophones with
sufficient uniformity to provide good
beam patterns.
During World War II the U. S. Navy
developed the Type JP sonar for listen-
ing purposes. This was a mechanically
trained line hydrophone, details of which
were published in Electronics magazine
for April 1946. Since that time, develop-
ment of submarine equipment has pro-
ceeded along the lines of physically larger
arrays, better matching of hydrophones,
and more sophisticated information proc-
essing in the receivers. The human ear
as a sound receiver is difficult to improve
upon and remains of first importance in
all sonar applications.
The largest and most complex sonar
array ever placed on a Naval vessel was
installed in the USS Flying Fish as a re-
search tool to enable scientists to study the
technical factors involved in passive sonar.
This array, 48 feet long and 24 feet wide,
contained more lineal feet of active hydro-

phones than had been installed on the
entire submarine fleet up to that time. A;
a result of these studies, greatly improved
submarine sonars have been designed and
installed in our submarine fleet.
Echo-Ranging Sonar
Echo-ranging sonar of searchlight type
was developed a decade or more before
World War II, and all of our antisub-
marine vessels were equipped with such
sonar at the time of our entry into the
war. By referring to the searchlight char
acteristic, we call attention to the fart
that this type of sonar projects intense
pulses of sound along a relatively narrow
beam, for example, 15 to 20 degree
wide. If the beam encounters the target,
an echo returns to the projector and gives

COMBAT
INTELLIGENCE
The mention of the term "Military In-
telligence" usually presents a mental pic-
ture of clandestine "Cloak-and-Dagger"
activities. In the minds of the layman it
has a Hollywood-type melodramatic con-
notation, one that reached its heights in
the imagination of the public during the
tense years of World War II. This is a
misconception that has been stretched be-
yond all bounds of actuality.
Military Intelligence, for our purposes
may be completely divorced from the
fanciful activities of Counter-Intelligence.
The difference between the two is readily
brought out by examining the purposes of
Military Intelligence: primarily, to obtain
tactical information about the enemy.
Military Intelligence, or combat intelli-
gence when it is applied to the battlefield,
is then, by definition of purpose, a tactical
activity. As such, it is not a hit-or-miss
process, but a highly technical and well
calculated procedure.
In Intelligence, as in nearly all phases
of the military, the problem of adequate
manpower for maximum efficiency of op-
erations becomes a very critical one. The
solution involves overcoming the same
bottleneck that exists in just about every
government-run department: duplicity of
effort.
The men in the Armor branch have a
word that is their key to success: "Mobil-
ity." In Military Intelligence, as in other
sections, this keyword is "flexibility." Not
only does the "flexible" soldier release
more manpower for actual combat, but in
the event of an emergency he is able to
perform adequately almost any task re-
quired. In order to have at its disposal
personnel who are equipped to suitably
perform many different jobs, the Army
must either train the personnel, at a great
expense of time and money, or obtain men
with the proper previous background. The
desirable solution is, of course, obvious.
In partial answer to this problem, Engi-
neering students have often asked a ques-
tion of their own: "In the event I have
to enter the military sen-ice, how can I
best utilize my technical education and
training?" The best "known" outlet for
such a background is, naturally, the Corps
of Engineers.
However, the close integration in Mili-
tary Intelligence of the engineer and the
military offers the student one of the
greatest challenges in the Army. The
Army of today is a huge complex and
technical machine. As a part of the very
core of Army tactical operations, intelli-
gence needs men who are best able to
run that machine. For clarity's sake, the
term "Engineer," as follows, will be used
to denote the engineering student or
graduate.
Under combat conditions, Military In-
telligence becomes integrated with other
staff sections to form a central master
operations unit. The very heart of this
unit is formed by G-2 (Intelligence) and
G-3 (Operations). Their function is simi-
lar to that of a quarterback on a football
team: calling the signals for tactical opera-
tions. For practical purposes, this opera-
tional master unit will be referred to as
"control." ,
In action, G-2 is primarily concerned
with three elements of information to
which the commander is seeking the an-
swers: the weather, the terrain not m
friendly hands, and the enemy situation.
Since the success or failure of an opera-

An array of standard types and grades of Asphalt comes from refineries in volume for a wide variety of engineering and industrial applications.
Asphalt is a versatile family of materials
"Asphalt" denotes a class of material
produced from crude petroleum ... it
is inherently durable, waterproof and
adhesive.
Asphalt is produced in a variety of
consistencies from hard solids to
liquids. The harder types are called
Asphalt cements. The more fluid types
are called liquid Asphaltic materials.
ASPHALT CEMENTS
By far the largest proportion of the
Asphalt family. Semi-solid to solid,
Asphalt cements answer virtually any
logical demand for the properties
desired in hot-mix types of pavement,
pipe-coating, water-proofing and simi-
lar engineeringand industrial products.
LIQUID ASPHALTIC MATERIALS
Fluid at normal temperatures, but
developing high-binding ability shortly
after application, liquid Asphaltic
materials are comprised of: (1) Cut-
back Asphalts and Road Oils, and (2)
Emulsified Asphalts.
The first are blends of Asphalt
cements and various amounts and
types of petroleum diluents, in three
standard types: Slow Curing, Medium
Curing, Rapid Curing. The Rapid Cur-
ing type contains, relatively, the most
volatile diluent. "Cutback" Asphalts
are versatile paving materials. They
also fulfill various industrial needs.
The emulsified Asphalts consist of
minute Asphalt globules suspended in
chemically-treated water. Also, in
three standard types: Rapid Setting,
Medium Setting, Slow Setting. When
deposited upon stone or soil, as in road
construction, the emulsions '"break,"
allowing the water to escape and
leaving an Asphalt film on the aggre-
gate. Names of the types indicate
relative rates at which their Asphalt
globules coalesce.

cations of Asphalt. Keep a complete

A short biography of one of the great-
est men of science who's theories have
set the groundwork of many of to-
day's scientific advancements.
In the year 1642 the scientific world
suffered a great loss with the death of
Galileo, but in that same year one of its
greatest geniuses was born. Nature had
seemingly replaced one great mind with
another.
Isaac Newton married Hannah Ays-
cough in the spring of 1642. Only a few
months after his marriage he died, Mrs.
Newton being left in a state of pregnancy.
The early death of her husband caused
her to give premature birth to her only
son. The child was so small that it was
doubtful if it would live. But the child
did live and was destined to enjoy a vig-
orous maturity.
When little Isaac reached the age of
twelve he was sent to the public school
at Grantham. In his first few years he
was extremely inattentive in his studies
and stood very low in the school. In fact
he was the second lowest in the school
when another of the boys began to jibe
him about being backward. A fight fol-
lowed in which Isaac proved himself vic-
tor by rubbing his opponent's nose against
the wall, the sign of complete victory.
Isaac became intent on not letting the
boy be over him in anything, and studied
his subjects with the fierceness of a boxer
in the ring. His opponent, sensing his
motive became a combatant equal to New-
ton. The severe struggle that followed
saw alternate success on both sides with
Newton finally gaining the individual
victory, as well as rising to the highest
place in the school. In this school, New-
ton showed a touch for mechanics in
building such things as a working model
of a windmill. The wheel was turned by
the action of the wind in its sails in
windy weather and by a mouse within a
wheel in calm weather. He also built a
kite to which he attached a lantern, made
of "crimpled paper", in order to terrify
the country people, who mistook it for a
comet.
In 1661, Newton entered Trinity Col-
lege, Cambridge. Although having not
received the ordinary amount of science
courses would seemingly be a handicap,
it was a help to him because it made him
more intent on studying these courses. Be-
fore he left for college his uncle had
given him a copy of Sanderson's Logic,
which he studied so thoroughly that when
he afterwards attended the lectures on
that work, he found he knew more of it
than his tutor. Finding him so far ad-
vanced, his tutor intimated to him that
he was about to read Kepler's Optics to
some Gentlemen Commoners, and that
he might attend the readings if he
pleased. Newton immediately studied the
book at home, and when his tutor gave
him notice that his lectures upon it were
to commence he was surprised to learn
that it had already been mastered by hi&gt;
pupil.
About this same time he bought a book
on Judicial Astrology at Stourbridge fair.
They were certain figures he could not
understand with his limited math so he
purchased an English Euclid with an in-
dex of the problems at the end of it, and
having turned to two or three which he
thought likely to remove his difficulties,
he found the truths which they enuni-
ciated so self-evident that he threw it
aside "as a trifling book." He then set
about learning Descartes Geometry which
he eventually mastered without assistance
and with his limited math background. He

tomorrow on his mind
—From Melpar, One of the Nation's Leading
Electronic Research &amp; Development Organization
Melpar's sure, swift growth during the past 11 years —
we have doubled in size every 18 months — is due, in
large measure, to the outstanding performance of our
engineering staff.
Our organization is continually called upon to per-
form tasks which have never been done before. Thanks
to the creative talent which forms the backbone of our
organization, we have grown both in stature and size.
Members of our staff have enjoyed similarly rewarding
growth.
Performance Determines Advancement
As Melpar grows so do members of our staff. Individual
recognition is a fundamental policy at Melpar. Should
you join our staff you will advance solely on the basis of
your performance on the job.
The average age of our engineering staff (one of the
youngest in the industry), and the rapidity of growth of
above-average men, are both clear indications of what
our policy of individual recognition can mean to you.
You can feel certain that your efforts will be justly and
quickly rewarded at Melpar.
Project Teams
In a number of large research and development organi-
zations the engineer is often confined to a narrow sphere
where his talents and skills cannot be utilized to the
fullest extent. At Melpar this hindrance to professional
growth and satisfaction has been eliminated by means
of our project team system.
Upon graduation you immediately become a member
of a project group. You are assigned responsibilities as
soon as you have had the opportunity to grasp the basic
concept of your program. With the opportunity to draw
upon the experience and abilities of the other members
of your "team", your program is carried from its initial
conception to completion of a prototype model.
This system will give you the satisfaction of seeing
your own efforts materialize, in addition to supplying
you with experience essential to eventual managerial
responsibility.
Fine Living Conditions
Melpar laboratories are located in choice suburban
areas near Washington, D. C, and Boston, Mass. These
two areas were selected as the sites for our laboratories
on the basis of their proximity to educational, cultural,
and research facilities well above the average. Fine hous-
ing in all price ranges is readily available.
Facilities
At Melpar complete facilities for creative research and
design are available. Our headquarters laboratory near
Washington, D. C. encompasses 265,000 air-conditioned
square feet, is ultra modern in design and equipped
with an eye to both present and future needs.

graduated from Trinity College with a
degree of Bachelor of Arts in January,
1665. In the same year Newton committed
to writing his first discovery of Fluxions
(or for a term we are more familiar with
"Differentials"). He relates their applica-
tion to finding tangents and "curvity" of
a curve.
It was probably sometime in the fall
of 1665 that Newton was sitting in the
ga-den at Woolsthorpe pondering on the
problem of gravity. The falling apple gave
him the idea that it could perhaps be the
same force that holds the moon in its
orbit that causes objects to fall on the
face of the earth. He worked out the law
that the force due to gravity was inversely
proportional as the square of the dis-
tance. But he gave up the idea because
there was such a large discrepancy in what
he figured the moon's deflection should be
and its actual deflection. His error lay not
in the law, but in the measurement of
the moon's distance from the earth.
In 1669 he was made a full professor
being given the position of the Lucasian
Professorship of Mathematics. In this
year, too, Isaac became interested in the
making of a good telescope. He tried
making various types of lens but found
none to be successful in obtaining a sharp
image. In his experiments he took peculiar
notice of the spectrum produced by light
directed through a prism. By changing
the position of the prism aand the sur-
face upon which the reflection was taken
he made several observations contrary to
the then believed qualities of light and
color. After various experiments he con-
cluded that the separation of white light
into various colors by a prism was due to
the fact that each color of light had a
different refrangibility. He also concluded
that white light was not a distinct color
of light but a mixture of all the other
colors. With these principles in mind he
made a very successful model of a reflect-
ing telescope, which he demonstrated to
the Royal Society. The Society recognizing
his potential elected him a Fellow of the
Royal Society. He then submitted his
theory on the refrangibility of light to
them. His theory was criticized by almost
all the leading scientists of his day.
Pardies, Linus, Gascoigne, Lucas, Hooke,
and Huygens all wrote papers against his
theory. He devoted a great deal of time
and effort to answering each objection, so
much so that he said he would never
answer another objection to his theories
again.
In 1679 Picard's measurement of the
earth's radius gave Newton the correction
factor he needed in his gravitational
theory. With an accurate measure to work
with he proved that the moon's deflection
was sixteen feet in a second, the same is
that of bodies at the earth's surface.
With the help of Flamsteed, the As-
tronomer-Royal at Greenwich, he expand-
ed his theory to encompass all the bodies
of the universe, In April of 1685 he de-
termined the attraction of masses, and
thus completed the demonstration of the
laws of universal gravitation. When the
Royal Society found itself in such a poor
financial condition that it couldn't publish
Newton's findings, one of its members, 1
Mr. Halley undertook the labor of edit-
ing, and the expense of writing his
theory "Principia") and thus earned the
gratitude of Newton and of posterity. In
1694 Newton resumed the study of lunar
and planetary theories, with the view ot
rendering more perfect a new edition ot
his book; but the difficulty which he ex-
perienced in getting the necessary observa-
tions from the Astronomer-Royal prevent-
ed him from bringing his investigations
to a close.
The exact usefulness of Newton's
fluxions were never appreciated during his
time. But this mathematical science which
was later named differential Calculus
proved a great asset in solving many ot
the astronomical theories of Newton. He
himself pointed out twelve types of prob-

stitute of Technology have won—and still
maintain—the universal respect accorded
them by their solutions to these questions.
An almost universally recognized fact is
that the performance of a new class of
engineering students in their first year
mathematics is a fairly reliable gauge of
the technical quality of the new group,
unless, of course, the first year mathe-
matics course has been tailored in ad-
vance to accommodate the least common
denominator of the group. Consequently,
we discussed publicly various problems of
higher education and research in the sci-
ences.
The results obtained by the students on
their examinations in the lower schools
determine what further education, if any,
they will receive from the State. Depend-
ing on the demand for technical personnel
—which has been, and continues to be,
high—a certain percentage of the stu-
dents is sent on to institutes of higher
training. The best of these students are
Russian mathematicians gather to hear an American discuss mathematical
developments in America.
it was of interest to me to learn whether
the reported increase in the number of
Russian engineering students had been ac-
companied by a corresponding decrease in
the quality of their technical education. I
therefore took every possble opportunity
of discussing with Soviet mathematicians
the teaching of mathematics in the engi-
neering institutes in the Soviet Union. I
was particularly interested in the views of
those who could compare the situation of
today with that of ten, or even twenty,
years ago. In addition to the important
centers of Moscow and Leningrad, I dis-
cussed the problem with professors from
Kiev, Kharkov, Lvov, Uzhgorod, Smo-
lensk, and Gorod Molotov, and I was the
guest of V. P. Eliutin, Soviet Minister of
Higher Education, at a reception where
sent to the universities where the stand-
ards, it appeared to me, are considerably
higher than those in all our universities
except for a handful of the privately en-
dowed universities. This is not to assert
that the Soviet scholars are necessarily
better scholars than their American coun-
terparts, but that, from the point of view
of scholarship, better use is made of
Soviet scholars. The large bulk of the
students sent to higher institutes goes to
what we shall call the technical institutes,
where the students are prepared as engi-
neers, technicians, and administrators for
Soviet industry. It is with this group that
my colleagues in the Soviet Unions have
their problems.
As a new five-year plan is announced,
with its increased quotas of technical per-
sonnel, the dividing line between those
who will and will not receive higher train-
ing must descend to a lower level. This
lowering of the dividing line has meant a
lowering of the standards, and each pro-
fessor to whom I spoke had witnessed and
was alarmed by the calibre of student
which the reduced admission standards
had forced him to confront, particularly in
the past ten years which have constituted
the period of most intensive growth. I
had a particularly interesting conversation
with the head of the mathematics faculty
in one of the largest engineering schools
in Russia; he showed me the questions
asked on the final examination given this
past year to first year students. He, too.
deplored the decline in standards and as-
se:ted that one of the objects of the
Ministry of Higher Education lay in the
propaganda value of the mass production
of technicians. It was not denied, how-
ever .that all of these technicians will be
useful in the industrialization of the
Soviet Union. The position of the high
officials in the Education Ministry is thus
enhanced as they fulfill their quotas in the
five-year plans. How similar are the mo-
tives of their American counterparts, the
deans and presidents of many large state
universities, who, having adopted the
large scale efficiency and publicity tech-
niques of business, have changed the con-
cept of higher education from that of
shaping intellectuals of our society to that
of preparing everyone for "living."
In short, I found the Soviet higher edu-
cation to be dynamic and expanding, even
more so than the American. Like its
American counterpart, Soviet education is
beset by its problems and growing pains,
with tremendous demands for its product
and with the difficulty that mass produc-
tion is accompanied by an inferior prod-
uct. As in the American technology, the
demand for the product is great enough
so that the product can be put to use. The
significant difference, I found, is in the
appreciation there of the really fine raw
materials, which are sifted out and not
committed to the stultifying process of
the huge educational production line, but,
rather, are given over to master craftsmen
to be shaped by hand into outstanding
quality products.

an audible "beep" or a visual indication
of its presence. The distance of the target
from the searching craft can be deter-
mined from the time required for the
pulse to go out and the echo to return.
The limitation of this arrangement is
that considerable time is required to cover
the bearings of interest by a process of
successively training the projector, sending
out a ping, and listening for an echo.
Thus, the searchlight is gradually trained
around the horizon with the danger ever
present that a second submarine may
sneak in on one of the blind sides.
An important improvement was made
as a result of research at Harvard Univer-
sity in 1943-45, sponsored by the Office
of Scientific Research and Development.
There, scanning sonar was successfully
developed in which the sound pulse is
sent out in all directions while the re-
ceiving beam is rapidly rotated to give a
spiral scan presentation. The returning
echoes are displayed on the screen of a
PPI (Planned Position Indicator) scope,
and give a picture of underwater targets
closely analagous to that given on the
radar screen.
There are important differences be-
tween radar and this type of sonar, the
most important being that the velocity of
sound, about 5,000 feet per second in
water, is a small fraction of the velocity
of electromagnetic waves. The latter travel
in free air with the speed of light, about
186,000 miles per second. In sea water
sound waves transmit very well, but elec-
tromagnetic waves transmit so poorly that
they cannot be used to locate submerged
submarines.
With sonar, the pulse lengths are many
milliseconds in length, and the rate at
which the beam rotates may be 30-150
revolutions per second. Several seconds
are required for the sound impulse to go
out and the echoes to come back and form
a pattern on the screen.
Scanning sonar has a great advan-
tage over searchlight sonar in that all
targets in the field are disclosed by each
ping, and no blind spots are left in the
forward sectors. One's own propeller
screws may produce sufficient noise to
blank out the scope on stern bearings.
The obvious technical shortcoming of
scanning sonar derives from the fact that
the transmitted energy goes out in all
directions and only a very small fraction
will be effective in "insonifying" the tar-
get or in forming the target echo. Various
electronic storage schemes and special
techniques have been devised to overcome
this shortcoming.
Many of the difficulties with sonar arise
because of the fact that the sea, particu-
larly near the surface, is a nonhomogene-
ous medium, full of bubbles, disturban-
ces, and thermal gradients caused by-
sun and wind. These facts bring the sci-
ence of oceanography into the picture.
Much research on sound propagation in
the sea has been carried out, but more
remains to be done.
Underwater Communication
There has always been need for re-
liable communication between ships at
sea, and when submarines operate in packs
or with surface vessels, they are no ex-
ceptions to this requirement. Communi-
cation between wholly submerged sub-
marines is not possible by radio because,
as we have noted, electromagnetic energy
does not transmit with worthwhile effici-
ency in water. We can, however, com-
municate by the use of underwater sound
very reliably to ranges of many miles.
Underwater telephones are now standard
equipment on our submarines. Before
these devices could be successfully de-
signed, it was necessary to experiment
with different kinds of modulation and
with different power levels and frequen-
cies in order to determine the best com-
bination for the particular conditions of
transmission under water.
The ocean, acoustically speaking, re-
sembles a very large room in which the
ceiling is almost a perfect reflector for
sound and the floor is partially absorbent.
The walls, fortunately, are indefinitely
distant although reflections may be ob-
tained when traversing special formations,
such as the submarine canyons which exist
in many coastal areas.
As is well known, the higher the fre-
quency of sound waves, the more highly-
attenuated they will be in sea water. Four
hundred watts electrical power results in
about 100 watts of acoustic power in the
water, providing a reliable communication
range of 10,000 yards.
In the underwater telephone the amp-
lifier incorporates a clipper which clips
the peak of the consonants; thus, a high-
er level of over-all amplification can be
used without the danger that the peaks
will overdrive the amplifier. Thus, speech
clipping improves the intelligibility of
voice transmission without increasing the
average power output required. The un-
derwater telephone has been found most
useful for relatively short-range com-
munication between submerged submar-
ines and between submarines and friendly-
surface vessels. There is, of course, much
room for improvement in the direction
of longer ranges and improved security.
The present underwater telephone is non-
directional so that any vessl equipped with
a suitable receiver and within the range
can understand the transmission.
Smaller, battery-powered versions of
underwater telephones have been designed
specifically for the purpose of use in emer-
gency, salvage, and rescue operations.
These have been shown to be more reliable
than the telephone buoys previously sup-
plied for use by submarines in distress.
Specialized versions of both echo-ran-
ging and listening sonar are being devel-
oped by the Navy for all the possible ve-
hicles which go beneath, on, or above the
sea. In addition to the active and passive
sonars already described for escort vessels
and submarines, special equipment is be-
ing developed by the Bureau of Aero-
nautics for use of blimps, helicopters, and
search planes from carriers. For example,
sensitive receiving elements, hydrophones,
and sound projectors may be towed by a
long cable from blimps, may be "dunked"
from a helicopter hovering above suspi-
cious points in the sea, or dropped from
carrier-based planes in the form of sono-
buoys. The latter are devices which re-
port back by radio to the circling plane
the sounds heard by a hydrophone
dangled from the buoy many feet below
the surface.

in the field of Combustion*
Historically, the process of combus-
tion has excited man's insatiable
hunger for knowledge. Since his
most primitive attempts to make
use of this phenomenon, he has
found tremendous fascination in its
potentials.
Perhaps at no time in history has
that fascination been greater than
it is today with respect to the use
of combustion principles in the
modern aircraft engine.
At Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft,
theorems of many sciences are being
applied to the design and develop-
ment of high heat release rate de-
vices. In spite of the apparent sim-
plicity of a combustion system, the
bringing together of fuel and air in
proper proportions, the ignition of
the mixture, and the rapid mixing
of burned and unburned gases in-
volves a most complex series of
interrelated events — events ocur-
ring simultaneously in time and
space.
Although the combustion engi-
neer draws on many fields of science
(including thermodynamics, aero-
dynamics, fluid mechanics, heat
transfer, applied mechanics, metal-
lurgy and chemistry), the design of
combustion systems has not yet
been reduced to really scientific
principles. Therefore, the highly
successful performance of engines
like the J-57, J-75 and others stands
as a tribute to the vision, imagina-
tion and pioneering efforts of those
at Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft en-
gaged in combustion work.
While combustion assignments,
themselves, involve a diversity of
engineering talent, the field is only
one of a broadly diversified engi-

tion depends upon these answers, two new
elements become priority: accuracy and
time.
False or inaccurate information, if ap-
plied to tactical ends, would inevitably
lead to disastrous consequences, and prove
more costly than no information at all. At
the same time, the value of accurate in-
formation depends on its being as up to
date as possible. Warfare, being the
dynamic operation that it is, is one of
rapidly changing situations. What may be
useful information at one particular time
may be completely useless a few hours
later due to a rapid turn of events.
This leads us to a differentiation be-
tween two terms: information and intelli-
gence. Information is merely raw news
which has been obtained through various
sources. Intelligence, on the other hand, is
information which has been processed by
the G-2 section and deemed worthy of
utility by the criteria of pertinence, credi-
bility, reliability, accuracy, and currency.
The relationship of G-2, G-3 in control,
is one where the intelligence processed by
G-2 is used by G-3 in planning offensive
and defensive measures utilizing that in-
telligence to its fullest advantage. With
the scope of G-2 thus defined in such
operations, the logical question then is the
employment of technically trained person-
nel, such as engineers, for maximum effi-
ciency of operation.
Let us now assume the G-2 section in
action, under combat conditions. One of
the more important duty assignments here
is that of the draftsman. His duties range
from posting the situation map to drawing
terrain layouts. He must have full knowl-
edge of coordinate systems and principles
of topography, as well as a skilled hand
with pen or drafting pencil.
The situation map, as a pictorial and
graphical representation of the latest tacti-
cal situation, is the focal point of the
central room. Around this map field offi-
cers get the latest up-to-date information
concerning their respective sections or
branches, and it is here that many deci-
sions and tactical plans are formulated.
The "Sit-Map," as it is called, must be ac-
curate and legible. A misplaced point of
1/5" on the map may mean a difference
of 25 actual miles on the ground. Because
of the rapidity with which the situation
changes, the draftsman is under constant
pressure and must be constantly alert and
on the move. This is a job that calls for
precision work in the midst of the noise
and activity of the control room activity.
It is here that experience and background
in engineering pays off.
Imagine now, that enemy artillery has
scored a near hit in the area of the con-
trol room. Immediately calls go out for
replacements for the injured personnel. If
the available personnel are sufficiently
adept at handling most of the tasks in
G-2, the situation may not be too critical.
However, if the journal clerk is at a com-
plete loss away from his typewriter, the
operations of the control room may be
critically hampered.
A draftsman, it is found, has been in-
jured. Can any of the available personnel
be spared? One of the subordinate units
has requested a detailed layout of terrain
occupied by enemy units. Now the ques-
tion is not a matter of having a quantity
of available personnel, but of having
"quality." The need is for a skilled drafts-
man, and the search is on for the right
man to do the job.
Let us suppose now, that due to the
artillery attack a few more men were in-
jured. The importance of the personnel
losses may be examined by a closer look
at the other various intelligence duty as-
signments. Perhaps the most technical,
and the one requiring the most skill is
that of aerial interpretation.
A messenger enters the control room
and hands, a large bulky envelope to a
major seated at a makeshift desk. The offi-

Pictured is the type of aerial photo-
graph the Photo-Interpreter must work
with. Under combat conditions, however,
the photo will not be as clear and as free
from distortion. From the photograph
shown, the P. I. must be able to deter-
mine the particular industrial plants
shown, the approximate sizes and capac-
ities of the major buidings, the function
of the gasometers, movement capabili-
ties of the railroad lines, and finally, the
critical points which would stop produc-
tion if destroyed.
cer calls to an NCO (Non-Commissioned
Officer) and says: "Let's have a detailed
analysis on the critical routes of approach
right away!"
Assuming that no trained P.I. (Photo
Interpreter) personnel outside of that
one NCO are physically available, it is
going to take quite a while to examine
the set of photographs that just came in.
However, any of the men, if they had had
some type of engineering background,
would be able to adequately perform the
task with instructions from the trained
NCO.
The sergeant finds two men to assist
him. Stereoscopes and slide rules now
become as crucial as operating implements
in the hands of a surgeon. A first glance
at the photographs show the interpreter
the exact scene observed by aerial recon-
naisance a half hour ago.
Now it becomes a search for details:
size, shape, shadow, tone, and relation-
ship to surrounding objects—these are the
keys that enable him to pick specific ob-
jects out of the small black and white
photograph.
A comparison of the color-tone of a
road to the objects around it enables the
trained PI to determine the material of
the road. Is it a dirt road? Is it concrete,
or at least paved, so that heavy Armor
and equipment can travel over it? Are the
hills too steep to allow cross country
vehicular traffic? These are questions that
the commander must know; only the in-
terpreter has the immediate answer.
How about bridges, overpasses and
underpasses? What are their widths and
lengths, their construction, and their maxi-
mum load capabilities? The new man
looks at the photograph; he sees a picture
only nine inches by nine inches. Do the
questions sound impossible? They may
well be if he hasn't the slightest com-
prehension of basic P. I. principles.
To the engineer it boils down to a test
of his knowledge of statics and logic, and
his ability to work with pinpoint accuracy.
First he obtains the scale of the photo-
graph: 1 to 25,000. That means that every
inch on the photo is equal to 25,000
ground inches. With his interpreter's ruler
he measures the width of the bridge on
the aerial photo and translates this from
thousandths of an inch into actual feet.
Knowing the width he can estimate the
size of vehicles that adequately pass over
the bridge.
A closer examination of the bridge and
its structure enables him to calculate the
approximate load. To the commander, this
is a result that has meaning in tanks,
weapons, and manpower.
Suppose a small group of buildings in
the photo draws his attention. What bear-
ing might they have upon tactical, or even
strategical planning? A knowledge of in-
dustry is a prime factor right now. What
significance can be attached to the wet
gasometers spaced over the area? How
about the generator yard or coal piles in
the picture? Is it a manufacturing plant,
such as an aircraft factory; is it a munition
plant; is it critical? The photo interpreter
must get the answers.
One of the officers wants more details.
How many freight cars can the marshall-
ing yard hold? How wide are the streams
that might impede cross-country move-
ment? What are the best locations for
fording points? How about presence of
any enemy activity? All the answers are

Ten Diesel Engines
Run 293,899 Hrs.
Six years ago the City of Los Angeles
built the Hyperion Activated Sludge
Plant, the largest sewage treatment plant
of its kind in the world. Of special inter-
est to power engineers everywhere are its
ten Worthington 1688-hp., dual fueled,
turbo-charged engines, operating on
methane produced in Hyperion's own
digestion facility.
The plant was not only designed to in-
corporate its own sewage disposal process,
but also to supply its own power from a
source located on the same site. With
this dual purpose in mind the dual-fuel
engines were purchased for the following
reasons: (1) Of the fuel used, 95 per
cent would be sewage digester gas and
the remaining 5 per cent would be diesel
fuel, thus utilizing an otherwise waste
product. (2) Dual-fuel engines operate
on any ratio of gas to oil, depending up-
on the amount of gas available. (3) Dual-
fuel engines, like gas-diesel, are much
more efficient than low pressure spark ig-
nition gas engines.
Now, six years later, Hyperion reports
one of the most outstanding operational
records in sewage treatment and engine
operation. With an average 30,554 hours
on each of its original nine engines, the
plant reported in Diesel Progress that dur-
ing six years' operations "it has not worn
out a piston ring, cylinder liner or bear-
ing!"
Engine No. 7, which was the first on
the line, is perhaps typical. This engine
has operated 38,367 hours. Yet it is still
running with original rings, bearings, and
liners. In April 1955, Engine No. 7
(which powers a blower) got a routine
overhaul after 8400 hours. Here are a
few of the findings: (1) Cylinder liner
wear at top of liners averaged .005 in.;
at midsection, .0035 in.; at bottom.
.0025 in. (2) Pistons and rings were
judged in excellent condition by main-
tenance engineer's inspection. Nowhere
was wear greater than .003 in. (3) Bear-
ings—the engine's originals—averaged
only .002 in. wear, and required neither
removal nor adjustment. Maintenance en-
gineers expect 100,000 hrs. per set of
rings.

Economy in 2lecttlcaL
Realizing that many of the graduates in
Electrical Engineering associate themselves
with large corporations in the power and
communication industries, in 1916 the
department decided to add the economic
viewpoint to its course in Power Plant
and Transmission System. Thus, as was
recommended by Committee 6 of the
Society for the Promotion of Engineering
Education, the student learned the practical
applications of such terms as capital in-
vestment, taxes, interest, depreciation, ob-
solescence and made analyses involving
economic selection. The field chosen,
Power and Transmission, is extremely
rich in published data concerning invest-
ment and operating costs, the units are
sizable and fundamental to Electrical
Engineering, and the training prepares
the student to understand the point of
view of business men and administrators.
This is particularly necessary for the de-
signing engineer who must use the cold
judgment of the business man "to get the
greatest possible value out of every dollar
spent" and restrain his enthusiastic opti-
mism for the very latest machine and
method available. A more attractive op-
erating efficiency must be calculated with
the number of hours of operation and
number of units produced and be weigh-
ed against its greater fixed charges which
amount to a sum surprisingly large to
those who have not given them detailed
study.
It is important that the engineer under-
stand how the corporation raises the
enormous amounts of capital required
for the initial construction of the public
utility projects, how this must be ex-
panded to meet the public demands for
greater service each year, what this costs
in terms of dividends and interest an-
nually, and how the securities in general
run on in perpetuity. Most of the money

Alfred H. Lovell, Professor of Electrical Power Plants, was born in Hamilton,
Ontario, Canada and became a naturalized American citiien in 1916. Three years
ago, he retired as Chairman of the Electrical Engineering Department, which he held
from 1945 through 1953; but he still teaches his two favorite courses: Power Plants
and Transmission Systems, and Economic Applications in Electrical Engineering.
Professor Lovell attended the University of Michigan receiving his Bachelor of
Science in 1909 and his Master of Science in 1914. He has taught at the University
of Michigan since 1910 anad was the Assistant Dean and Secretary of the College
of Engineering from 1933 through 1944. Since 1920 he has belonged to the Society
for Promotion of Engineering Education, for which he is the Commissioner on Engi-

for electric utility undertakings is bor-
rawed by two general methods: (1) by
the sale of stock, (2) by the sale of
bonds. The original promoters subscribe
to various amounts of stock and with the
proceeds build some plant and facilities.
Then they place a mortgage upon the con-
struction plant and under the mortgage
sell bonds for additional capital. In decid-
ing to what extent an enterprise shall be
financed through the sale of stock and
to what extent through the sale of bonds,
the promoters and the bondholders have
diametrically opposed interests. From the
bondholders' point of view, their invest-
ment is much more stable and secure with
a relatively large stock issue. On the other
hand the stockholders are correspondingly
anxious to have a small stock issue in
proportion to the bond issue. A number
of the electric light and power utilities
seem to have their securities about even-
ly divided between the two classes. (SSee
Moody's Public Utility reports.) At this
writing high quality bonds are carrying
3.47 to 3-99% yield to maturity with
stocks of the same quality grouping yield-
ing 4.66 to 5.29%.
The student will be surprised at the
variety and the amount of taxes levied
against his proposed design. Just like the
harassed householder the utility will be
subject to the advalorem property taxes,
and in addition it is liable to the State cor-
porate franchise fees, to the State and
Federal unemployment compensation
taxes, and to the state chain-store tax if it
sells appliances in its branch offices, and
possibly municipal compensation. Then
provision must be made to pay the Fed-
eral income tax on its earnings, a com-
bined rate of 52% for income above
$25,000 plus a possible 30% on "excess
profits," to pay the Federal old-age benefit

So you decided to look at last month's
answers. Have you no confidence in your
own? No, of course not. You just want
to be sure. Well, month before last you
had a problem about two airplanes, one in
New York and one in San Francisco. The
question was: if they traded cities, which
one would crash. Some people say that
since they had equal amounts of fuel, the
plane flying from Los Angeles would
have to travel farther. However, they
neglect the atmosphere, which also ro-
tates from west to east. Or some may
claim that the New York plane will start
later and arrive earlier than the San Fran-
cisco plane by virtue of a change in time
zones. Yet others claim that the prevail-
ing westerly winds (meteorological, not
academic) will hinder the New York
plane. But nothing was said about winds
in the problem, and since it is quite pos-
sible for them to blow from the east, this
factor should be- discarded. The true an-
swer is that the shortest distance between
two points is a straight line. Since each
plane had just enough fuel to reach its
destination they would both have to trav-
el the same line! In other words, rain is
only one form of precipitation.
Concerning the typing accident the
Technic grants that the problem is not the
easiest; so here is the complete answer:

So much for the old problems, now
here comes the new. It is not too often
that you have gotten problems in chem-
istry (from the Technic, that is) ; so here
is one problem for the whole month. It
should really make you react.
You have a test tube full of unknown;
you are told the following:
1. The flame test is between yellow and
red.
2. A precipitate forms when the pH is 6
and NaCl is added. When filtered and
hot, 12MNH10H is added to the fil-
ter if HCl is again added to the fil-
trate until it is neutral: no precipitate
forms.
3. In (2) the filter remains white.
4. If the pH of the original is adjusted
to 5 and H,S is added after filtering,
the precipitate is gray.
5. The unknown when slightly basic pro-
duces a sulfide precipitate which ap-
pears almost black.
6. The residue from (5) is permitted to
stand and is digested with lMNaOH.
The new residue is brown and does
not give a colored borax bead test.
7. The filtrate from (6) when acidified
with 6MH.SO, gives a white precip-
itate from a turbid solution. NaOH
does not precipitate the filtrate further.
8. The filtrate from (5) forms a precip-
itate when treated by the filtrate from
(6).
9. The precipitate is then digested with
lM acetic acid and the pH then
changed to 5 when potassium chromate
is added. A yellow precipitate is ob-
served.
10. Carbon dioxide is piped into the orig-
inal solution made basic until precip-
itation is just complete. The filtered
solution is evaporated to dryness, and
nothing is left. The precipitate is dis-
solved in HCl and made basic with
ammonium hydroxide. The solution
gives no flame test when viewed
through cobalt glass. The precipitate
when boiled with potassium chlorate
is completely insoluble (the potassium
excepted) in dilute acids. If no or-
ganic compounds are in the unknown,
what cations are present? Bring or mail
your answers to the Technic office.

people submitting correct answers will
be printed. As a final hint, only those
cations listed in any book on qualita-
tive analysis. A complete analysis of
the problem will appear in the Janu-
ary issue.
Now for a passing thought: some who
think their studies are on firm ground
find themselves treading on thin ice.

YOUR STEEL NOTEBOOK
Hew to shape a vacuum cleaner like a basketball
O
TO make their new vacuum cleaner
functional as well as handsome,
engineers at the Hoover Company
developed a nearly round design.
The problem was how to produce
it economically.
The first ring dies they used to pro-
duce the shape from sheet steel picked
up bits of steel and scored following
pieces. Production had to be shut
down while the dies were polished.
Finishing costs ran high.
After studying the problem, Timken
Company metallurgists recommend-
ed a special analysis of tool steel
for the dies. Graph-Mo®, developed
by the Timken Company. Minute par-
ticles of graphite in Graph-Mo act as
a built-in lubricant—keep parts from
galling. Diamond-hard carbides in
its structure make it wear, give it
longer life.
With the new Graph-Mo dies, down-
time was cut 50%. Production rolled
smoothly. The dies outlasted previous
ones 3 to 1. It's another example of
how Timken pioneering in fine alloy
steels helps solve knotty industrial
problems.

an idea to help
you advance faster
SUCCESSFUL designers state that
costs are the most important
factor in the success of any product
development today. Manufacturers
recognize this and, as a result, seek
out the engineers who are cost
minded.
Industry's stress on lower costs
comes from the increasing competi-
tion for buyers. Rising costs of ma-
terials and labor must be offset by
good designs to keep selling prices
down to realize a profit from sales.
Ingenious use of materials is the
best way you can eliminate needless
expense in manufacture. By using
steel as the basic material and weld-
ing for fabrication, you have a de-
cided advantage in saving money
for a manufacturing company . . .
and getting your designs accepted.

Results from using welded steel

the above design comparison of a
typical bracket used on modern
machinery. The cast bracket costs
$28.13. The welded steel bracket
costs $6.49, weighs 65% less, yet is
stronger and more rigid than the

Similar savings are possible in
many types of mechanical parts.

on the photograph; it's up to the inter-
preter to find them and translate them in
terms of intelligence.
A telephone rings. Division has a re-
port that an enemy unit is approaching
in their area. How long will it take them
to reach such a location and begin offen-
sive operations?
Once again, another engineering prob-
lem: what is the ground distance between
the regiment and the location in ques-
tion? What is the rate of approach, and
what is the unit's closing time? Again,
calculations and more calculations; not
hasty guesses, but pinpoint precision an-
swers.
These are but a few of the technical
problems facing the combat intelligence
unit. So far operations have been those of
G-2 on a higher headquarters level. How-
ever, Military Intelligence also remains a
key operation, although to a lesser extent,
in subordinate units down to, and includ-
ing, battallion.
Two of the more critical activities dur-
ing combat are those of the combat and
reconnaisance patrols. On a regimental
level the latter job falls to the I &amp; R (In-
telligence and Reconnaisance) platoon. A
reconnaisance patrol, of from nine to
twelve men from the I &amp; R platoon, may
be called upon to penetrate behind enemy
lines in an effort to obtain information on
their strength and position. The Intelli-
gence personnel in the patrol will have to
estimate the size of the enemy units on
line from quick calculations of numbers
and relative positions of troops and
equipment observed.
Reports have been reaching headquar-
ters of a new secret weapon now possessed
by the opposing forces. However, the
reports have been contradictory in their
appraisals of the weapon: a rocket
launcher, says one source; no, conven-
tional artillery with adaptations, says an-
other. Still another source guesses it to be
an anti-armor device. The commander,
however, doesn't want guesses: he wants
answers.
Now the job of the patrol becomes
more specific: find the new weapon and
bring back a report on it. Because of
enemy activity along the planned patrol
route, the patrol may be forced to do their
observing at a distance that makes de-
tailed analysis difficult; or, they may get
within close range of their objective b
have only a few precious minutes to cai
out their task.
Does the new weapon appear capal
of operating under its own power, or is
wired to outside power sources? What a
its outstanding mechanical features? He
does it compare in size, shape and genu
appearance to known enemy weapon
What are the peculiar features of its ei
placement? In the short time available, t.
engineer must apply his entire reservoir
knowledge of machines and mechanist
in an effort to determine the new pit
of equipment he sees before him.
Back at headquarters a report is turn
in and a sketch is made of the obsen
weapon. These are compared to previo
bits of information on the weapon, ai
the commander, now knowing what it
can take measures to counteract it.
In this case, as in the previous site
tions, the success of Military Intelligcn
in performing its job quickly and acn
ately was due to the fact that the perse
nel involved has some knowledge of enj
neering principles. Unfortunately, tl
ideal condition, that of the right man
the right job at the right time, will r
always exist. The chances of it existir
however, may become more of a certair
by the utilization in critical fields of
available personnel with engineering ed
cation and backgrounds. Military Intel
gence is just such a critical field.

Newton didn't want to publish his

How a precision
grinder holds its
precision—for years
In pre-loading super-precision ball bearings, a
precision surface grinder is used for close-
tolerance grinding of bearing ring faces (see
photo). In the grinder diagrammed here, mov-
ing parts are mounted on Fafnir ball bearings
to assure the absolute rigidity essential for this
exacting work.
All bearings indicated, except the thrust bear-
ings at the bottom of the column supporting the
wheelhead arm, are Fafnir pre-loaded, super-
precision types. The oscillating wheelhead is
similarly mounted. Original bearings in column
and workhead have been in operation and have
maintained their precision for over IS years.
A long history of such successful bearing
applications is a big reason why engineers
throughout industry look to Fafnir for help
with special bearing problems. The Fafnir Bear-
ing Company, New Britain, Conn. (23 Branch
Offices)
An interesting aspect of an engineering career with
Fafnir is the opportunity for first-hand observation of
Fafnir products actually on-the-job in Fafnir plants.
Fafnir bearings are widely used in equipment neces-
sary for bearing manufacture, including machines such
as the precision surface grinder above.
The opportunity for on-the-job evaluation of bearing
performance is invaluable as a source of information —
and, often, inspiration — in the vital, diversified work
of designing, developing, and assisting in the applica-
tion of bearings for all of industry. Perhaps Fafnir offers
you the challenges and satisfactions you want in en-
gineering, or sales engineering- We'd be glad to hear
from you-
Pemberton prevailed upon him to publish
it. The first translation from the Latin
didn't appear until 1736.
Because of his failure to publish his
invention of calculus others laid claim to
being the inventor. Leibnitz and Bernoulli
both asserted to be the first inventor of
calculus and accused Newton of plagiar-
ism. Instead of involving himself in an-
other controversy that would take up
valuable time and effort he asked his
friend, Dr. Keill, to defend him. Dr.
Keill, being an experienced champion
along these lines, soon disproved the ac-
cusations of Newton's oppressors.
In the autumn of 1692, when Newton
had finished his letters on fluxions, he
did not enjoy that degree of health with
which he had so long been favored. The
loss of appetite and want of sleep, of
which he now complained, and which
continued for nearly a year, could not
fail to diminish that mental vigor and that
consistency of mind which he had hither-
to displayed. His physical condition may
have been brought on by the failure of
parliament to grant him an annual income
so that he might continue his work.
At this time Dr. Bently gave a series of
lectures on the existence of a Deity. In his
course of lectures he asked Newton for
aid in understanding astronomical oc-
curances. He made a number of queries
of Newton, which are self-evident from
Newton's answers:
1. "I know no reason why there is only
one body qualified to give light and heat
to all the rest but because the Author of
the system thought it convenient and suf-
ficient to warm and enlighten all the rest.
2. "The motions which the planets
now have could not spring from any
natural cause alone, but were impressed by
an intelligent agent. To make such a
system with all its motions, required a
cause which understood, and compared
together the quantities of matter in the
several bodies of the sun and planets, and
the gravitating powers resulting from
thence; the several distances of the pri-
mary planets from the sun, and of the
secondary ones from Saturn, Jupiter, and
the Earth, and the velocities with which
those planets could revolve about those
quantities of matter in the central bodies;

tax, to pay a Federal excise tax on any
recreational facilities maintained for the
employees, and in Michigan to collect the
State sales tax of 3% paid by customers
as an increment to their electric bills.
There may also be a Federal retailers' ex-
cise tax paid by customers as an incre-
ment to their merchandise bills. Thus for
1955 the Detroit Edison tax bill was near-
ly $45 million. For the national electric
light and power industry in 1955 the
total taxes amounted to 23.6% of its
revenue dollar.
It must be realized that, from the very
day the construction of a power-machine
unit or plant is completed, deterioration
begins, and by the wear and tear from
use and the age and physical decay from
lapse of time, there results a reduction of
value, a loss of some part of the original
investment in the perishable property. The
rate of the wear and disintegration will,
of course, depend upon the conditions
under which the apparatus is operated,
how it is protected from the elements, and
how promptly required repairs are made.
It is therefore necessary, as the property
decreases from its original cost completely
installed to its final salvage value, which
may perhaps be as merely so much scrap
metal at the end of its useful life, that the
owner have in hand nearly as much money
at any given date as represents the shrink-
age in value. At the time of retirement of
the plant, he must surely have in hand
the full sum of the depreciable part of the
property. This amount added to the net
salvage value will enable the owner to
rebuild the same type of property that he
built in the first instance, build some other
property or more-generally expand the
same kind of property, of equivalent
earning power, or invest the amount to
earn the cost of money on the original
plant.
The young engineer will find many
guides as to the service life in years, the
net salvage in percent, and the annual de-
preciation rate in percent for the various
items for electric utilities in the reports
of the Public Service Commission of Wis-
consin and in the Depreciation Manual of
the Tennessee Valley Authority. For 1955
the national average for the light and
power utilities gave 10.1 ^ of their reve-
nue dollar for depreciation.
The useful line of a power unit is
generally determined by physical depre-
ciation and functional depreciation, in-
cluding under the latter term the two
causes of inadequacy and obsolescence. In
physical depreciation there comes a time
when the increasing maintenance cost of
replacing broken and worn-out parts with
the accompanying decrease in efficiency,
due to the increasing frequency and seri-
ousness of the ills of the machine, so
increase the cost of operation that it would
be cheaper to pay the costs on a new piece
of apparatus.
Obsolescence indicates that, as a result
of engineering achievement, the present
apparatus, whether it be one piece or a
whole class, hast become uneconomical of
use. The field of power generation and
distribution has developed so rapidly that
larger and more efficient machines and
methods are constantly being sought out.
For example the 50,000-kw steam turbine-
units in the Trenton Channel power house
of the Detroit Edison Company, working
at 375 lbs. 700°F. took 14,000 Btu to
produce a kwhr in 1938. By 1956 with a
new station installed at the St. Clair River
containing units of 156,000 kw working
under 1850 lbs., 1000°F. with reheat to
1000' F. the system economy improved to
11,080 Btu per kwhr of net output.
For a look into the future we note that
the American Gas and Electric Company,
has ordered a 450,000-kw General Elec-
tric generating unit to come on to their
system at Terre Haute, Indiana, about '59,
which will work at 4500 psi and a tem-
perature of 1100°F. The new plant will
be joined to the existing A.G. &amp; E. sys-
tem by a 330,000-volt transmission line.
The plant is expected to show an im-
provement of 5% in thermal efficienq'
over the world's best to date to operate at
about 7800 Btu per kwhr, and an im-
provement of lJ/2% in capital cost per
kw.
As a result of his analyses the engineer
is daily faced with the necessity of making
an economic decision concerning his proj-
ects. For example, consider the University
power station, which must furnish the
heating for the 115 million cubic feet of
rapidly expanding building volume, to-
gether with the light and power require-
ments of the same. Since the heating
amounts to about 60% of the total load
will it be better to select a non-condensing
plant rather than to choose a condensing
design for better economy on generating
the electric power load. What would be
the annual costs of the two types of plants?
What would be the present value of the
saving for the life of the cheaper plant,

and if the cheaper operating design has
an increased price in how many years
would the saving retire the extra cost?
It was pointed out in the previous dis-
cussion on depreciation that in spite of
repairs and renewals of parts the age and
physical decay increase so that physical
property eventually reaches a stage where
it may be like the Deacon's one-horse
shay and where it may be more advan-
tageous to retire the plant than to con-
tinue with its operation. Thus entirely
aside from supersession due to inadequacy
or obsolescence investigation must be
made from time to time to ascertain
whether the plant or apparatus is worn
out or has reached the limit of its eco-
nomic life. On this determination let us
consider the case of a machine already
installed and operating; all errors in de-
sign and all possibilities of design modi-
fication will thus drop out. Then if we are
able to discover the ideal time at which
to scrap this machine, we shall have a
standard for judging each succeeding
machine of identical design. In the first
place, as our machine continues in use,
certain parts will be subject to wear and
will be replaced at an operating cost for
maintenance which will increase as the
more slowly accumulating repairs pyramid
on top of the (smaller) frequent early
repairs. Also, since restoration of worn
parts will take place only when they have
deteriorated functionally, machine per-
formance will always be lower than when
new, and a given output can be secured
only at a higher operating cost than when
the machine was first installed. These two
factors unite in encouraging us to replace
the present machine at as early a date as
possible.
On the other hand, if supersession is
postponed, there will be an increasingly
longer time in which to collect the de-
preciable part of the investment, and the
yearly cost of this accumulation will be
less and less.
Lastly, there will be the carrying
charges of taxes, insurance, and money
use. Since we have already made our
original investment, and since we are not
at this time considering any changes in

This handy, pocket-sized calculator may be an engineer's &lt;
helper in the nar future.
It will be possible for a caller's picture to be "dialed" like
an ordinary telephone call, provided the switch on the picture
equipment is turned on at both ends of the line. If the switches
are off, the telephone call will be completed without pictures.
TThe picture can also be turned on after a conversation is
underway. It would be impossible for a customer to be seen
by the caller unless he slipped on the switch.
The Picturephone, after further development, could be offer-
ed as a separate optional telephone service. The unit would
be made much more compact than the present experimental
apparatus, which is about the size of a small suitcase.
Slide Rule Replacement?
A new calculator, put out by the Utility Supply Company,
has been placed on the market recently. The calculator is
simple enough for a child to operate, and it can find answers to
problems involving multiplication of numbers running into the
billions, squares, cubes, percentages, division of large numbers,
square roots and the solving of equations.
The uniqueness of the Cutta Calculator lies in the fact that
it performs calculations in much the same manner as large
desk calculators, yet it is small enough to be carried in ones
brief case or pocket.

"As I review the progress in aeronautics within so short a span, and marvel
at the complex aircraft of today, I call it an achievement little short of miraculous.
"Today, electronically-guided planes take off and land without human touch.
Lethal sky missiles seek and destroy invisible targets with uncanny precision. And still other
fantastic achievements in both man-controlled and pilotless flight are now in the offing.
"When men go to the moon and planets, electronically-controlled sky craft will take them
there. Aviation maps will be studded with stars as well as with cities. New developments
in aeronautics will go on and on. Success opportunities and careers will continue to develop
for ambitious young men in this exciting field where a new era is beginning!'*
Appropriately qualified to speak for aeronautics and
other fields in which his own scientific achievements
play an important part, Dr. Lee de Forest gives help-
ful counsel to young graduates headed for successful,
rewarding careers.
His expression, "a new era is beginning" has parti-
cular significance at Northrop, world leader in the
design, development and production of all-weather
and pilotless aircraft.
At Northrop, permanent positions are available that
offer full play for individual talent and ambition. Here
the graduate engineer will find interesting assign-
ments for which he is best fitted. Surroundings are
attractive, co-workers congenial, opportunities for
advancement unceasing, the compensation good.

neering Industrial Relations, Northrop Aircraft, Inc.,

together in so great a variety of bodies,
argues that cause to be not blind and for-
tuitous, but very well skilled in mechanics
and geometry.
3. "The reason the exterior planets,
Jupiter and Saturn, have a smaller density
than the rest is because they would have
caused a considerable disturbance to the
whole system [if it had not been so].
4 "Even if the sun could, by its rays,
carry about the planets, yet I cannot sec-
how it could thereby effect their diurnal
motion."
Newton's defense of the existence of
God places him in a field where many arc-
unfamiliar with his work. Besides being a
mathematician and a physicist, he was a
philosopher and a theologian. The num-
ber of papers and letters he wrote on
theology equal or surpass the number of
his writings on other subjects. But New-
ton never published his works on religion
for fear of being involved in a religious
dispute. His papers were discovered,
though, after his death.
Newton also worked on a great many
other theories in other fields where he
performed noticeable services. Two ex-
amples of such experiments were his work
with the eye of a sheep to determine why
two eyes only see one image and his paper
on the nature of acids. The mind of New-
ton found no handicap in subject matter.
If there was a fallacy to be corrected he
sought only to correct it. The thirst of his
mind for truth wasn't quenched until
March 20, 1727 when it gave up his body
in death. His body lies in Westminster
Abbey in England where a large monu-
ment marks his grave. The epitaphon his
monument serves as a brief summary and
a lasting tribute to his remarkable life.
Here lies
Sir Isaac Newton, Knight,
Who, by a vigour of mind
almost supernatural,
First demonstrated
The motions and Figures of the Planets.
The Paths of the Comets, and
the Tides of the Ocean.
He diligently investigated
The different refrangibilities of the
Rays of Light,
And the properties of the Colours
to which they gave rise.
An Assiduous, Sagacious, and Faithful
Interpreter of Nature, Antiquity, and the
Holy Scriptures,
He asserted in his Philosophy the
Majesty of God,
And exhibited in his conduct the
simplicity of the Gospel.
Let Mortals rejoice
That there has existed such and so great

STEAM
AND THE WORLD'S
LARGEST BAKERY
This new boiler plant at Nabisco's huge
Chicago bakery was planned to provide,
efficiently and economically, the steam
that the bakery must have on tap at all
times for heat, hot water and various
processing operations.
Because the reliability, efficiency and
economy of its steam source are so vital
to this world-famous company, they
selected B&amp;W boilers.
Think a moment of most companies'
use of steam—and its cost. Take a fast
turn around a boiler plant. Spend a
little time chatting—perhaps quite prof-
itably—with engineers. Get the facts on
a company's invested steam dollars in
relation to the return they're getting. If
the facts add up to problems, B&amp;W en-
gineers can and will help industrial com-
panies and their consulting engineers
solve these problems.
When a B&amp;W boiler is chosen, long-
range performance is assured. And isn't
that what the buyer really wants? Not the
boiler but its end product, the steam,
and the assurance of an efficient, de-
pendable, economical steam source. The
service records of thousands of B&amp;W
boilers, in thousands of large, small and
medium sized industrial and utility
plants, supply that assurance.

Engineering
(Continued from page 72)
the design of our machinery, these three
costs may be considered as constant and
will not affect our judgment in either di-
rection.
To determine the economically ideal
time for supersession, due to economic
decay alone, we may write a cost equa-
tion that involves all these factors. As
here used, the annual depreciation rate-
will be that based on the "actual" life of
the machine, not our original estimated
life. Then by differentiating with respect
to time in years and equating to zero, we
may find the point of ideal cost, i.e., the
point at which supersession should occur.
We originally used the symbol O to
designate operating cost per year. When it
comes to plotting this quantity as a func-
tion of time, the question immediately
arises as to how this shall be done. The
operating cost as taken from the ledger ac-
counts is the total cost for the whole year
and cannot, therefore, be accurately plot-
ted as occurring at a date corresponding
to the end of that year. An approxima-
tion possibly will be given if it is as-
signed to an abscissa corresponding to the
middle of the year.
However, another method of analysis
may be used to obtain an equivalent uni-
form annual cost of operation spread over
the years of operation, not the actual oper-
ating cost during the nth year. This
equivalent uniform operating cost for the
period, added to the depreciation allot-
ment for the same time, gives the total
variable cost for that particular period.
This total will decrease at first with the
lowering of the depreciation, owing to the
actual use over more years of life, but
will increase later on owing to the in-
creased cost of operating the unit in its
older years of life. Where the total var-
iable cost reaches a minimum is the
significant point for our analysis.

speaks from experience when he says ..
"I find the Applied Research Laboratory
of U. S. Steel an interesting and
rewarding place in which to work."
The rapid rise of Mr. Bachman at
United States Steel's Applied Re-
search Laboratory in Monroeville,
Pa., is typical of that of many scien-
tists and engineers who have come to
U. S. Steel from college and who
have staked their future with this
organization.
Mr. Bachman received his B.S.
Degree in 1951 and his M. S. Degree
in 1952. Both of these degrees were
in Ceramic Engineering. While at
college, he served as a Research As-
sistant on a commercial research
refractories problem.
In June, 1952, Mr. Bachman was
employed in the Refractories Divi-
sion of the Applied Research Labora-
tory as Assistant Technologist. Dur-
ing his four years of employment, he
has received two promotions. Today,
he is the Supervising Technologist,
Refractories Division, at this labora-
tory.
Mr. Bachman has said: "At U. S.
Steel's Applied Research Labora-
tory, we are actively solving prob-
lems that are of vital importance to
the steel industry. These problems
are many and varied, including as
they do activities in the fields of
physics, chemistry, mathematics,
and electrical, mechanical and met-
allurgical engineering."
Today, more than ever before, the
young man graduating from college
will find every opportunity for rapid
growth opened to him at U. S. Steel
—whether in research or in hundreds
of other engrossing operations which
make up the daily work of this con-
stantly expanding industry. If you
are interested in a challenging and
rewarding career with United States
Steel and feel that you can qualify,
why not get in touch with your col-
lege placement director for further

WHY Ductile Cast Iron is different:
In conventional cast iron (left) the
graphite is in flake form, making for
brittleness. In Ductile Cast Iron (right)
it's formed into tiny spheres — this
makes for toughness, plus greater
strength. (Magnified 100 times.)
HOW Ductile Cast Iron can be twisted
and bent without breaking is shown
above.
TODAY, Ductile Cast Iron is a material
of many varied uses. Everything from
pinking shears to plowshares-washing
machine gears to jet plane parts! And
industry is rapidly expanding its uses
of this economical cast material.
An Inco development, Ductile Cast
Iron is a new material that combines
the best features of cast iron and
steel.
Like cast iron, Ductile Iron has
good fluidity. It's easy to cast. It
machines well.
Like steel, Ductile Iron is strong
(the picture at left proves it). Its
ductility is outstanding.
With Ductile Iron, industry is cut-
ting costs on materials, production,
maintenance. Write for "Ductile
Iron, the Cast Iron that Can Be
Bent." This booklet will be helpful
to you in your engineering courses
and also later on, when you face
problems as a practicing engineer.

Assistant Professor of Nuclear Engineering
Department of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering
Soon to be on North Campus .
THE FORD NUCLEAR
REACTOR
University of Michigan's
North Campus with the
Phoenix Memorial Labora-
tory and the Ford Reactor
shown in the foreground.
With the completion of the Ford Nu-
clear Reactor a vast new frontier will be
opened at the University of Michigan.
Not only will this machine provide unique
experimental facilities at the University
but it will also provide students and staff
with first hand experience with the prob-
lems of operating and using a nuclear
reactor. A course is already being offered
which will give students experience in
operating the reactor and using its ex-
perimental facilities.
The Ford Nuclear Reactor is a one
megawatt reactor which together with its
building cost one million dollars. It is a
swimming pool type reactor with the core
of the reactor clearly visible through twenty
feet of high purity water. The core of the
reactor contains approximately 23 fuel ele-
ments each 3" x 3" x 24" long. The
U-235 fuel in these elements is contained
in 18 plates. The plates are sandwiches
with the fuel on the inside and 23 alum-
inum on the outside. The fuel elements
set in an 8 x 10 position matrix plate with
graphite reflector elements surrounding
the fuel elements.
There are at least three distinct en-
deavors which will be advanced by the
presence of the reactor. First, the reactor
will make it possible to train students in
reactor technology. It will provide not
only the opportunity for students to work
with an operating reactor and its experi-
mental facilities but the reactor will also
attract students and staff to the Univer-
sity. Second, those people active in reactor
technology can now design experiments
using the reactor which will give them
some of the badly needed data with which
more efficient and economical reactors will
be built. Third, uses of the reactor radia-
tion for purposes other than its degrada-
tion into heat can be studied. Here lie
some of the interesting possibilities such
as direct conversion of the nuclear energy
into chemical or electrical energy.
Although the reactor is not alone re-
sponsible for growth of a nuclear engi-
neering program at the University, it is
one of the principal factors. The first
masters degree in nuclear engineering was
granted in 1954. Last year there were 9
masters degrees awarded and a Ph.D. pro-
gram was inaugurated. There are now
75 graduate students in the masters degree
and Ph.D. degree programs.
The reactor will be used as an intense
source of neutrons and gamma rays. The
heat that is generated is removed at
temperatures of less than 100° F. and is
not used.
The Ford Nuclear Reactor is designed
to operate at the power of one megawatt.
It is the highest power reactor located on
a university campus. There are several re-
actors with higher power levels, but these
are at Atomic Energy Commission installa-
tions.
Special provisions have been made to
build such a high power reactor in the
middle of a campus. The primary haza_T&amp;
JANUARY, 1957


is the radio activity contained within the
reactor. Heretofore, such a reactor has
always been located inside a large fenced-
in area. Instead of this, the University has
located the reactor in a windowless build-
ing of monolithic construction so as to
contain any radioactivity which might be
released inside.
A factor which greatly enhances the
use of the reactor is its location. Not only
is it easily accessible to those wishing to
use it, but also it is adjacent to the facili-
ties of the Phoenix Memorial laboratory
equipped to handle all levels of radio-
activity up to the equivalent of 10,000
curies or Co-60. These facilities make
the installation unique for any university
campus.
The reactor is operated by the Michigan
Memorial-Phoenix Project. The Phoenix
Project was established to pursue all
phases of the peaceful uses of nuclear
energy. It is the policy of the Phoenix
Project to make the reactor available on
a equal basis to workers in engineering,
science, medicine and other fields of en-
deavor. The reactor is to be used first to
train students, second, to provide experi-
mental facilities for faculty and student
research and third, to provide experi-
mental facilities for industry. The re-
actor will be operated initially on a forty
hour week although it is expected that
the demand will be such that more shifts
will be added.
Although security and classification are
often obstacles in nuclear energy work,
there is nothing about the reactor that is
classified. Furthermore, experimental work
with the reactor will be unclassified.
Special Experimental Facilities
To utilize effectively the radiation from
the reactor several special experimental
facilities have been incorporated. The
facilities include beam ports, a thermal
column, a pneumatic tube system and an
underwater pass-through connecting the
reactor pool with a hot cell.
The beam ports serve two functions.
They permit a horizontal beam of neu-
trons to be taken from the reactor through
4 feet of water and 6y2 feet of high den-
sity concrete. Once outside this shield the
collimated neutrons can be used for a
variety of uses. The beam ports also per-
mit experiments to be placed next to the
reactor at the end of the ports.
There are 14 beam ports in all. Twelve
of these have 6 iflcn inside diameters and
two 8 inch. Neutron beams taken from
the ports will be ordinarily of much
smaller dimensions, the order of y4 inches
square. One of the reasons for using high
density concrete for the shield is to
shorten the distance a beam must travel
to get outside the shield. Shorter distances
mean stronger beams.
The thermal column is a 6 x 6 x 8 foot
long stack of graphite positioned so that
the reactor can be centered on one 6x6
foot face. The graphite is especially pure.
The usefulness of a thermal column lies in
the fact that carbon does not absorb neu-
trons nearly as readily as does water.
Thus, the thermal column provides a re-
gion in which there are well thermalized
neutrons distributed more uniformly over
a larger volume than in the water.
There are two operating positions for
the reactor. One of them is at the front
end of the pool where there are twelve
of the beam ports. The second operating
position is in the middle of the pool with
the thermal column on one side and two
beam ports on the other side.
A pneumatic tube system permits rapid
exposure of small samples to reactor radia-
tion. The system is similar to that used in
department stores except that the tubing
16
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


are 1I/2" O.D. and the carrier can carry
samples up to 20 grams. One end of the
system terminates in the pool along side
the reactor. The laboratory terminals are
located in laboratory hoods.
The underwater pass-through connect-
ing the pool with a hot cell is a section of
12" pipe with a valve on each end. The
valve in the hot cell is air operated for
remote control manipulation.
Reactor Laboratory Course
The reactor laboratory under Professor
Ernest Klema has already offered students
an opportunity to participate in the ef-
fort of getting the reactor into operation.
Their first effort was to fill the pool for
the first time with high purity water.
The water used to fill the pool is purified
with two mixed-bed demineralizers. These
demineralizers each purify 1000 gal per
hour but can remain on stream with Ann
Arbor city water for only 6 to 8 hours.
At the end of this time the demineralizer
must be regenerated with muratic acid
and caustic. The students had first hand
experience in the operation and regenera-
tion of the demineralizers.
Another project of the course was a
complete check of the control circuits for
the reactor. A systematic checking proce-
dure was worked out which would
guarantee each switch, motor, relay and
relay contact was functioning correctly.
The procedure was then used to perform
the check.
Experiments which will be performed
in the course are all intimately connected
with the reactor. Each is designed to
demonstrate either a use of the reactor or
a technique used in reactor operation.
One of the experiments will be the de-
termination of the mass of U-235 required
to attain criticality. The object is to add
increments of fuel in such a way that
there is no possibility of adding too much.
Too much fuel presents the possibility of
the power of the reactor rising at such a
rate as to be not easily controlled.
The purpose of the control and safety
rods in the reactor is to provide a means
of controlling the power of the reactor.
The effect or worth of each rod must be
determined experimentally. This can be
measured by adjusting the rods to give a
just critical reactor. Then the rod to be
evaluated is withdrawn a small amount.
The rate of rise of reactor power is then
measured which is a measure of the
change of worth in moving the rod. This
experiment is repeated with various ini-
tial rod positions until the rod is com-
pletely evaluated.
Another experiment involves measure-
ment of reactor power and power distri-
bution using foils which become radio-
active in proportion to the reactor power.
Initial Reactor Experiments
Before the reactor can be used as a
source of radiation a large number of
experiments must be performed on the
reactor itself. The experiments are neces-
sary to characterize the reactor so that
safety of operation can be assured. During
this time the reactor will be operated at
power levels of less than one watt. At
power levels below this the fuel elements
do not become too radioactive to be
handled. It is expected that this low
power level will be necessary for three
months.
During this initial period operating
procedure will be checked for workability
and safety. Instrument behavior will be
watched particularly for reliability and
troubles.
The first experiment will be used to de-
termine the masses of U-235 required to
make the reactor critical under various
conditions. These will be followed by ex-
periments to evaluate the worth of the
control and safety rods. The effect of the
beam ports and thermal column on the
reactivity of the reactor will be deter-
mined also.
A measurement must be made to estab-
lish the power level of the reactor. At such
low powers it is not practical to determine
the power by a calorimetric method. In-
stead the neutron flux will be measured
and converted to power information.
With this the sensing power of the ioni-
zation chambers will be calibrated.
Water temperature has an effect on the
reactivity of the reactor and this must be
measured. Also a complete flux mapping
of various core configurations must be
performed.
Initial Experiments
Many uses of the reactor are being con-
sidered and are developed to varying de-
grees. Many of the plans are still in the
embryonic stages. Among the experiments

ATOMS FOR MEDICINE
by BETSY PALMER, '58E
Atomic energy, while offering possible
solutions to some human suffering, pre-
sents a medical environment which may
spell trouble for mankind.
The advent of man-made atomic energy
has presented medical science with both
a new area of threat to man's life and
new tools to wield in behalf of man's
well-being. Radioactive isotopes are pro-
viding a means of determining physiologi-
cal processes, additional means of diag-
nosis, and some tailored-to -the-job treat-
ments for disease. Possibilities in the area
of drug sterilization and food preserva-
tion are being explored. The effects of ra-
diation on both plant and animal life
raise hopes for better food and antibiotic
production.
At the same time, these effects of at-
omic energy engender fears for the future
heredity of the human race. Survivors of
Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and the 1954 H-
bomb tests at Bikini have shown unfor-
tunate reactions in the direction of ster-
ility, cancer and leukemia, and skin dis-
orders. From all indications, although at-
omic radiation is to be a blessing to the
health of the world, it is to be a seriously
mixed blessing.
Geiger Counters on Radioisotope Trail
Since Rudolf Schoenheimer and Harold
C. Urey of Columbia University first used
heavy hydrogen and heavy nitrogen to
trace the consumption and oxidation of
fats and proteins, isotopes have been on
their way as aids in solving physiological
puzzles. X-ray and radium have been
sources of radiation for diagnostic work
for something on the order of 60 years.
Man-made isotopes are now providing
cheaper radiation sources. Much less lim-
ited in application than the two heavy
isotopes are the myriad radioactive iso-
topes. These have been used as tracers for
heart failure, hardening of the arteries,
kidney, liver and glandular disturbances.
The qualities of radioisotopes which
make possible their extensive use in these
ways is the fact that, while their presence
is readily detected with Geiger counters,
in chemical processes they behave no
differently than their stable counterparts.
This makes them useful in discovering by
what processes the body is built and main-
tained and how food enters into these
processes.
The first supply of radioisotopes, from
the cyclotron invented by Dr. E. O. Law-
son at the University of Gdifornia, was
very limited and also very expensive. Oak
Ridge made its first shipment of reactor-
produced radioactive isotopes in August
of 1946. Now their purchase from Oak
Ridge Isotopes Division is a routine mat-
ter for doctors, at a surprisingly low cost.
In like fashion the early problems of
measurement have been solved to the
point of mass manufacture of instru-
ments.

tion utilizes radioactive iodine, replac-

Formerly the tubercles composed of dead
cells and scar tissue which wall off the
infection were considered impenetrable by
drugs. Isoniazid has been shown to oper-
ate inside these tubercles. The chemistry
of the situation was determined partly by
use of lab animals and partly through the
cooperation of patients about to undergo
TB surgery. Material taken from animal
tissue was separated into spots or bands
for identification on a paper strip by a
process known as paper chromatography,
Then the paper strip exposed a photo-
graphic plate and the substances formed
from the original compound could be dis-
tinguished. Tests on animals helped to
determine safe dosage intervals with re-
spect to nervous reactions. Sections of
brain tissue containing radioactive ma-
terial developed self-portraits on photo-
graphic film when they were kept together
in a deep-freeze for thirty days.
rine was discovered as a structural analog
of a necessary constituent of desoxyribose
nucleic acid, or DNA. DNA is a basic
part of chromosomes, and is necessary for
the reproduction of cells. In work at the
Sloan-Kettering Institute in New York
City tracers were used to find that 6-mer-
captopurine prevents the formation of
DNA, and hence the growth of malig-
nant tissue. In animals this has been used
where it wouldn't interfere with healthy
p:ocesses, with the following results: One
tumor was caused to disappear; growth
of others was slowed down. There is a
bare possibility that human cancers can
also be treated in this way.
The condition of excess red corpuscles
which hinder circulation by partially clos-
ing off capillaries has been successfully
treated by dosage with water containing
radiophosphorus. This goes to the bone
marrow, where the red corpuscles are
formed, stopping overproduction.
The existence of blood banks during
World War II was possible only through
tracing with radioactive iron. Medical
students were injected with the isotope,
so that it was shortly present in newly
formed red corpuscles. Various preserv-
atives were tried on small samples of their
blood, which was then injected into other
volunteers. The amounts injected were
small enough that the original trouble—
disintegration of red corpuscles, setting
hemoglobin free to block the kidneys, re-
sulting in possible death—did not affect
the volunteers. It was feasible to use this
small amount only because very small
quantities of radioactive iron can be de-
tected. Thus a workable preservative was
found, and the world is now blessed with
blood supplies kept on hand for emer-
gencies.
Useful Isotopes
Although only four radioisotopes—
gold-198, iodine-131, cobalt-60, and phos-
phorus-32—are in general medical use,
possibly as many as 700 may be medically
helpful, according to L. E. Farr of Brook-
haven National Laboratory. More radio-
iodine is shipped by Oak Ridge than any
other isotope. Its use is mainly in diag-
nosis, but some is used for treatment. It
is not so much distrust of radioactive
therapy as it is lack of knowledge and
uncertainty as to the value of some of
these isotopes, says Farr.
While cobalt-60 is a cheaper material
for the same uses as radium has had, facili-
ties for housing it must be just as exten-
sive, and the half-life of Co-60 is only a
little over five years (as compared to 160O
and secreted in the urine is measured with
Geiger counters. The test has been used
successfully on over 100 patients. Liver
function is tested similarly with a mix-
ture of rose bengal dye and radioiodine.
Sensitivity is reported to be five times
that of ordinary dye tests.
Radioactive phosphorus has been used
to demonstrate that half the phosphorus
in the blood plasma changes places with
phosphorus in the bones within a half
hour. In a like manner, the original atoms
forming red corpuscles have been found
to remain in the corpuscles throughout
their four-month life span.
Lloyd J. Roth and Roland W. Manthei
report in last November's Scientific Amer-
ican on the function of Isoniazid. This
drug is one of three discovered in the last
decade to be partially effective against tu-
berculosis. In order to indicate where to
look for more effective drugs, radioactive
carbon has been incorporated into the
chemical structure of Isoniazid at the cir-
cled spot in the diagram below:
Tracer Research Leads to Treatment
In 1938, radioactive tracer research was
begun on the thyroid gland. This gland,
in which most of the iodine of the body
is lodged, regulates metabolism through
compounds of this element. In cases of
over-activity of the gland, treatment is
usually given with drugs or surgery. But
in some cases there is allergy to the drugs
and surgery would be too great a risk. In
this event proper dosages of radioiodine
can destroy enough thyroid tissue to re-
duce activity to the normal level.
Cancer of the thyroid, like cancers in
other organs, spreads to other parts of the
body in subsidiary cancers known to path-
ologists as metastases. In a small minori-
ty of cases, according to Jacob Stacks of
the University of Arkansas, the cells of
the metastases will collect iodine in the
same manner as the original thyroid cells.
Then radioiodine can be used after sur-
gery on primary cancer, and the secondary
cancers can be cleaned out. The cases in
which this can be done are determined
through use of tracer doses of radio-
iodine and follow-up with a Geiger count-
er.
Professor Stacks also reports that ra-
dioisotope tracers have been used to find
a chemical analogue for folic acid. Such
structurally similar compounds have been
known to block the action of vitamins.
Aminopterin, the one found for folic
acid, was used to temporarily check leu-
kemia in children. Leukemia is a cancer-
like condition of the bone marrow in
which a super-abundance of white blood
cells are formed.

for radium. Still, the saving is worthwhile.
Further, Co-60 is valuable as a substitute
for X-ray machinery, which is expensive
to install, requires great quantities of elec-
tric power, and annoys the TV-watching
neighbors. The drawback to extensive use
of cobalt-60 is the consequent reduction
of the number of neutrons, essential in
producing the isotope, available for other
purposes.
Caesium-137 is being investigated as a
possible substitute for cobalt-60, since it
is a waste product of nuclear fission. This
material, with a half-life of 37 years, is
a disposal problem.
Thulium-170, discovered at Argonne
National Laboratory, is an X-ray emitter
rather than a beta and gamma radiation
source. As such, it is being considered by
the military for a portable X-ray unit us-
able in the open field without need for
current supply. This radioisotope also uses
a neutron source for its formation.
Body fluids outside cell structures have
an affinity for chlorine-38 and sodium-24.
In edema cases these can be used to mea-
sure the volume of such fluids. Chlorine-
38, with a half-life of 37 minutes, may
be used to treat cancer of the peritoneal
cavity, as its presence would harm the
surrounding tissues little after its work
was done.
The liver collects almost all of some
compounds of manganese-56 within 10
minutes of injection into the blood
stream. This isotope, a beta and gamma
emitter, may be used for treatment oi
cancer of this organ.
Boron-10 metamorphoses almost im-
mediately into lithium-7, giving off alphi
particles. These particles have a range ot
about one cell diameter. It takes onh
about ten minutes from time of injection
for boron-10 to become highly concen

Background of
the first transatlantic
telephone cables
Each room in Western Electric's clinically clean
repeater plant was kept under positive air pressure
at all times so that dust-laden air could not leak in.
Teamwork characterized the Bell System's role in the
success of a tremendous undertaking: laying the first
transatlantic telephone cables.
One challenge given engineers and scientists at Bell
Telephone Laboratories was that of designing equalizing
networks and amplifiers to be placed in the cables every
40 miles to compensate for the huge attenuation losses.
Electron tubes of unrivaled endurance were developed,
capable of operating for up to twenty years.
Western Electric, manufacturing and supply unit of
the Bell System, assembled the repeaters in a special
plant under clinical conditions. A mere speck of dust
could fatally upset the sensitive amplifiers.
The delicate and demanding job of laying the cables
was supervised by engineers from Long Lines Depart-
ment of A. T. &amp; T. New cable-laying equipment was
designed, and exacting procedures were devised so that
the cable could be laid smoothly and safely on an ocean
floor in places more than two miles deep.
Teamwork helps Bell System engineers and scientists
to anticipate and provide for America's growing com-
munications needs, no matter what the magnitude of the
job to be done.

Not enough
to go around
How times change!
Not so very long ago, an engineer
struggled to obtain a degree.
Yet afterwards he just couldn't find a
job that would let him utilize his
hard-earned knowledge, much less start
to build a career. Today, however,
the demand for engineers exceeds
the supply ... so much so that there
are not enough to go around.
We need engineers and skilled
technicians. That hundreds of other
companies do, too, is extremely well
evidenced merely by thumbing through
your newspapers and magazines.
Why should you choose us above them?
Perhaps you shouldn't. Neither should
you come to that decision without
first becoming fully aware of our
record ... who we are, what we
do, where our future lies. For, in
whatever field you choose to
pursue a career, your transition from
neophyte to veteran will not depend
on ability alone. Without ample
opportunities to demonstrate your
talents, you'll not be able to prove your
potential value in any industry.
We would like to tell you about
our company. We hope, too, that you
will reciprocate and give us the opportunity
to evaluate you. You can do this
by writing to Mr. Richard Auten,

Peacetime Reactors
For a number of years now, there has
been much talk about harnessing the at-
om to provide power for private use and
for industry. Many people had criticized
the United States because it was well
known that both Russia and Great Britain
were busy building atomic power plants,
and it seemed, for a while, as though the
U.S. didn't care to join in the running.
Actually, our own scientists have been
working on the design of such a reactor
for many years. In three years time this
country will have several power plants
of this type, ranging in size from pilot
setups to full-scale generating stations
capable of producing 100,000 kilowatts.
The two largest of these are located in
this general area, one at Shippingport,
Pennsylvania, about 40 miles from Pitts-
burgh, and the other one right here in
Michigan, at Munroe. Although they
generate their power through atomic re-
action, the two differ in several respects.
The Shippingport power plant is a
government-sponsored project, under the
auspices of the AEC. Actually, it is a
joint venture of the AEC and the Du-
cjucsne Light Company, which supplies
1,250,000 kilowatts to the Pittsburgh
area. The 65,000 kilowatts which it will
produce (enough to supply a city of 45-
50,000) will be bought by the Duquesne
Company, paying the Commission 8 mills
per kilowatt hour. The eighty million dol-
lar plant will start operation in July 1957.
and will be the first scale A-power plant
in the country.
The Munroe power plant, on the other
hand, is a private venture which was en-

igan in 1955 as a non-profit corporation
to design, build, own and operate an ex-
perimental atomic power reactor to dem-
onstrate by actual operation that such re-
actors may be relied upon to provide an
economical source of heat to be used in
the generation of electric power. At pres-
ent, 26 companies have indicated their
intention to become members of PRDC
and to contribute to the cost of the proj-
ect. Not all APDA companies are par-
ticipating, some of them because they are
engaged in other atomic projects. The
Detroit Edison Company is a member of
both these organizations, and will pur-
chase the steam produced by the reactor,
utilize its own turbine-generator, and
transmit the electricity to its own power
system. Due for completion in 1959, the
$55,000,000, 100,000 kilowatt generating
station, unlike the Shippingport plant,
will house a "breeder reactor" that con-
serves atomic fuel, by creating more than
it consumes. Very appropriately, the
PRDC plant is named in honor of the
late Doctor Enrico Fermi, an American-
Italian scientist who, with his associates,
was the first to initiate a sustained nu-
clear reaction. It is this same controlled
chain reaction demonstrated by Fermi
which will produce heat to run a steam-
electric turbine generator in the plant.
Dr. Fermi was also the first to realize
the importance of the breeder principle,
and even said that the first nation to de-
velop the breeder reactor would lead the
world in nuclear progress.
To avoid duplication, we shall discuss
the Shippingport plant, and then point
out differences between itself and the
Munroe project. The basic schematic di-
agram of the reactor and the steam plant
of the former is shown in Fig. 1. Tin-
nuclear reactor is the heat source and
produces a minimum full power rating
of 790xl0,; BTU-hr. This heat is pro-
duced in a nuclear core, which is a right
circular cylinder consisting of assemblies
of enriched uranium in clad plates and
natural uranium in tubes. These assem-
blies are supported in a bottom plate and
top grid, which, in turn, are supported
from a ledge of the reactor vessel. This
reactor vessel is a cylinder with a hemi-
spherical bottom and a removable hemi-
spherical top closure. Coolant enters
through four nozzles at the bottom of the
reactor and leaves through four nozzles
at the top.
The reactor plant consists of a single
reactor heat source with four main cool-
ant loops. Three of these loops are re-
quired for producing the 60,000-kw min-
imum design power. Each loop consists
of a single-stage centrifugal canned-motor
pump, a heat exchanger section of a steam
generator, and the necessary 18-inch out-
side diameter interconnecting piping.
High-purity light water serves as both
coolant and moderator in this plant. This
water is under a pressure of 2000 psi.
The flow through the nuclear core is
45,000 gpm for three loops. At full pow-
er the inlet water temperature to the re-
actor is 508°F. and the outlet temperature
is 524°F. The water velocity in the 18-
inch pipes is approximately 30 ft/sec,
with a velocity of between 10 and 20
ft/sec in various parts of the nuclear
core. The total pressure drop around the
main coolant loop is 105 psi, and this
drop is divided roughly equally between
core, steam generators, and piping.
The coolant enters the bottom of the

couraged by the government. The reactor
itself is the result of tnany years of work
on the part of the Atomic Power Develop-
ment Associates, Inc. (APDC), a non-
profit membership corporation organized
under New York law. It is a group of
U.S. industries having as its primary ob-
jective, the development, of atomic power
into a commercially practicable means of
electric power generation. The Power Re-
actor Development Company (PRDC)

water flows upward between the fuel
plates and rods, with the remainder by-
passing the core in order to adequately
cool the walls of the reactor vessel and
the thermal shield. After having absorbed
heat as it goes through the core, the wa-
ter leaves the top of the reactor vessel
through the outlet nozzles. It then passes
through two 16-inch isolation valves in
series and goes through the heat-exchan-
ger section of the steam generator. The
water then flows through the canned-mo-
tor pump and back through the inlet iso-
lation valve to the bottom of the reactor,
completing the cycle.
Isolation valves are located immediately
adjacent to the reactor inlet and outlet
nozzles of each of the four loops. These
valves permit isolation of any loop of the
reactor plant to provide maximum protec-
tion to the reactor and so that mainten-
ance can be performed while the remain-
der of the loops are in operation. Shield-
ing is provided to permit this.
The main coolant flows through the
inside of many hundreds of small stain-
less-steel tubes in the heat-exchanger sec-
tion of the steam generators. These heat-
exchanger tubes are surrounded by the
water of the secondary system, which is
heated by the primary coolant in the
tubes. Wet steam is formed, which passes
upward through the risers and enters the
steam-separator portion of the steam gen-
erator. Here the moisture is removed and
returned to the heat-exchanger section
through the downcomers. The dry and
saturated steam at 600 psia at full power
leaves the top of the steam separator and
goes to the steam turbine.
The nuclear part of the power station
is housed in four steel plant containers,
which in turn, are in concrete compart-
ments partially below ground level. The
reactor vessel is in a spherical shell 38
feet in diameter with an 18-foot cylin-
drical dome on the top to accomodate
the extra height of the control-drive me-
chanisms. Located on each side of the
sphere is a 50-foot diameter cylinder, 97
feet long, in which are located two of
the primary coolant loops and their asso-
ciated equipment. An additional auxiliary
container is located between the nuclear
equipment containers mentioned above
and the turbine generator. This container
is a cylinder 50 feet in diameter and 147
feet long and houses the coolant pres-
surizing tank and other minor auxiliary
equipment. All of these containers are
interconnected by several eight- and
twelve-foot ducts. These precautions
should restrict the spread of radioactivity
in the event of a dual casualty, i.e., rup-
ture of the primary coolant system and
subsequent melting of the nuclear core
with attendant release of fission products.
The reactor vessel, as shown in Fig. 2,
has an overall height of 33 feet, with a
cylindrical section with an internal di-
ameter of about 9 feet and a nominal
wall thickness of 8y2 inches. The total
estimated dry weight of the reactor vessel
is 250 tons. It is formed of carbon-steel
plates and forgings with a 0.25-inch
stainless-steel cladding. The flange for the
closure will be 9 feet internal diameter
and 23 inches square in cross section. The
hemispherical closure head will be forged,
and have a final thickness of about 10
inches, with adequate reinforcement for
the 24 control-rod penetrations and the 9
fuel-port tubes. The vessel is supported
by the neutron shield tank at a point just
below the vessel flange. This permits the
same to grow due to thermal stresses, with
a minimum increase in main-loop piping
stresses. The entire vessel is thermally in-
sulated with about four inches of glass-
wool insulation. The core assemblies are
supported in a stainless-steel cage con-
sisting of a barrel, a bottom plate, and a
support grid. The cage is nearly 8 feet
in outside diameter and slightly over 13
feet high.
The active portion of the nuclear core
is in the form of a right circular cylinder
6 feet in mean diameter and 6 feet high.
To minimize the amount of enriched
U'-r&gt; used, the core consists of some high-
ly enriched seed and some natural blan-
ket assemblies. The highly enriched, or
seed assemblies are located in a square
annular region about 6 inches thick. The
area inside and outside of the annulus is
filled with natural uranium oxide sub-
assemblies. A cross-section of the core is
shown in Fig. 3. Each seed subassembly
consists of several plates welded together
to form a box. Four of these box-type
units are welded together, with separation
maintained by spacers, to form a central
cruciform-shaped area. In each of these
areas is located a cruciform-shaped haf-
nium control rod.
The uranium oxide, or blanket assem-
blies use a rod as the basic element (see
Fig. 4). These rods are Zircaloy-2 tub-
ing, which are filled with U02 pellets and
have Zircaloy-2 end plugs welded to each
end to form fuel rods. These rods are

respect for a new idea has attracted selective engineers for 39 years. Here, the young engineer needn't settle initially on modest
goals, for lack of experience. His ideas can elevate him to positions of leadership. To draw technical opinions from all levels,
Vought opens to each engineer a wide view of his own job and its relation to others. This broadening begins in the first weeks of

for which plans have progressed the
furthest are studies of neutron diffraction,
the effect of radiation on chemical reac-
tions, the corrosion of graphite by liquid
metals under irradiation, and activation
analysis. Uses which are in earlier stages
of planning are general radiation damage
studies, wear studies using parts irradiated
in the reactor, testing of standard electron
components under irradiation, brain tumor
treatment and production of very short-
life isotopes for medicine.
Experiments using neutron diffraction
are based on the wave behavior of neu-
trons. Information on molecular structure
can be obtained using this technique
X-ray diffraction is similar except that
x-ray diffraction techniques are unable to
supply information on hydrogen atoms.
Gamma radiation is known to have an
accelerating effect on some chemical reac-
tions. The reactor is a much more intense
source of gamma rays than the Co-60
sources on campus that are now used in
such studies. To take advantage of this a
continuous flow, chemical reactor is being
designed which will operate in a beam
port.
An interesting type of reactor is the
liquid metal fueled reactor. Graphite is
being considered as a container for the
bismuth-uranium fuel. However, before
such a reactor can be designed data must
be obtained on the corrosion of graphite
by the liquid fuel in the presence of radia-
tion.
Activation analysis is a very sensitive
method of analyzing for some elements,
sodium for example. The method makes
a sample radioactive with neutrons. The
resulting radio-activity is measured and
the decay of the radioactivity is followed
to determine the presence of those ele-
ments for which the method is most sen-
sitive. Activation studies are now in
progress using a much weaker source. The
pneumatic system will lend itself par-
ticularly well to activation analysis.

There's satisfaction in meeting a challenge
For engineers worth their salt, challenge is stimulating. We live in such
an atmosphere at Detroit Edison, a company internationally known
for its bold, imaginative engineering. Rut let's be specific.
Soon it's going to be sound economics for us to transmit energy at
345 kv. There's not much precedent to draw on: much remains to be
clarified about system design, operation, radio interference, line losses,
relays, system integration, lightning performance. Where does the
challenge stop?
Or take the problem of heat exchange. We're deep in atomic power
plant design, where sodium is the primary coolant. Efficient heat
exchange is essential! There's the same problem with respect to gas
turbines and critical-pressure boilers, too.
We also plan to use our digital computers, and like equipment, in new,
untried ways. Applying them to engineering and management problems,
for example. But it will take time AND talent to do some creative
engineering first.
If these challenges—a few at random—suggest a career that appeals to

tratcd in brain tumors. For these reasons,
it may well have application in treating
brain tumors without harming surround-
ing brain tissue.
Possibilities in the Food and Drug Field
David O. Woodbury, in an article in
the June, 1955 Nation, states that gen-
eticists at Brookhaven National Laboratory
have developed a rust-resistant oat. After
a little more than a year, exposure to
cobalt-60 resulted in this new strain which
can withstand the onslaught ol its most
troublesome fungus pest. There is hope-
that the occurrence of constructive muta-
tions can so be speeded up beyond na-
ture's rate through use of radioactivity.
Radiophosphorus has been used in
studies of the best use of phosphorus fer-
tilizers for corn, potatoes, sugar beets,
etc. It is hoped that through such studies
man will be able to stave off the hungry

day when there will be too many mouthes
to feed and too little land on which to
produce food.
In a government-sponsored project at
the University of Michigan, research has
led to irradiating potatoes prior to several
years' unrefrigerated storage. Radioactive
caesium is being used to keep the potatoes
from either sprouting or rotting.
The army's quartermaster corps have
been working on means of sterilizing food
after complete sealing. Perhaps by radi-
ation meats, vegetables, and fruits may be
kept on the pantry shelf for months at a
time. Before this time comes, however, the
problems of altered taste and color, as
well as outrageous cost, will have to be
solved.
Radiation has produced mutants of the
mold from which penicillin is derived.
This has made possible the large-scale-
production of penicillin. Brookhaven Na-
tional Laboratory, were research of this
kind is being carried on, expects that
among the many, many grotesques pro-
duced by radiation, there will be more of
these desirable mutants.
"All That Glitters"
In several cases, the experience of medi-
cal personnel with the effects of radiation
on living matter has led these people to
express fears about radioactive fall-out.
The most sobering consideration is the
possibility of alteration of the genes and
chromosomes, controlling factors of the
design of an organism in reproduction.
For humans the fear is apparently not
that some particular changes in anatomy
will begin, eventually resulting in a race
of different appearance and/or organic
funcions. Paul G. 'Espinasse of the zo-
ology department of the University of
Hull, England, states that such changes
in the human being are recessive char-
acteristics. According to him, the reason
for this is that human beings are sexual,
requiring that the same change in chromo-
somes of both male and female would
have to occur in order to start the ball
rolling on such a process.
Rather, the genetic effect of radiation
is expected to reduce their abilities to
cope with their environment. These pos-
sible effects include sub-normal intelli-
gence, pre-natal deformities, and lowered
resistance to disease.
The National Academy of Sciences in
Washington has reported on observations
of some 200,000 survivors of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki, over 200 Marshall Island-
ers and 22 Japanese fishermen affected by
the Bikini H-bomb testing in 1954, as
well as on many laboratory experiments
with animals. While the report strength-
ened the Atomic Energy Commission's
claims that present testing of nuclear
weapons does not raise the overall radi-
ation count above a safe level, it does
indicate that atomic war would immedi-
ately and decisively change this picture,
with resulting increased susceptibility to
eye cataracts, leukemia and other cancers,
sterility, and shortening of life. On page
70, the June 25, 1956 issue of Neusu eek
quotes Dr. Warren Weaver, head of the
NAS genetic committee, as follows; "The

PROGRESS
Compiled by BERNIE MIGAS
The first world-wide Geo-physical year
is now under nay. Scientists from all over
the world will be studying all parts of our
own globe and the vast unexplored re-
gions of space. Although the articles we
have compiled for your interest here are
not directly connected with the project,
they are typical of the advances science
has made over the past few months. The
University of Michigan is actively parti-
cipating in the Geo-physical year, and in
future technic reports we will bring
more results directly connected with the
big project.
Here now are a few progress reports
from all over our nation.
The Sun Sleuth
A "sun sleuth" that has kept its auto-
matic eye glued on the sun continuously
for two years at Miami, Fla., for General
Motors Research Staff may help unravel
The Spectroheliometer or Sunshine Spectrum Recorder has made a continuous
record of intensity of sunlight in various parts of its spectrum. The record is corre-
lated with the weathering of automotive finishes (on exposure racks in background)
at the Florida Test Field.
the mystery of what some of the sun's
rays do to auto finishes.
Called a Spectroheliometer, the device
recently tracked the sun from dawn to
dusk for 8,104 hours, recording the
amount and intensity of certain parts of
the sun's light that are known to have a
weathering effect on paints, lacquers and
enamels.
While the Spectroheliometer was in
service, Chemistry Department researchers
put new auto finish sample panels on ex-
posure racks each month at Miami. This
was done to find out how much paint
weathering varied from month to month.
The amount of weathering on each new
panel each month is being correlated with
the Spectroheliometer's reports of varying
intensities and amounts of the sun's radi-
ation, rain or shine.
The GM instrument follows the sun's
path in the same manner that astronomical
telescopes follow paths of the stars. It
picks up the sunlight and passes it
through a spectrograph. This breaks the
light into a color band stretching from
the "red" to the "blue" light of the sun's
spectrum.
Thermopiles convert five of the various
light bands into electrical signals that are
amplified approximately 100,000 times so
that both amount and energy intensity of
each band can be recorded on graph pa-
per.
Largest Cesium-137 Source Prepared
At Oak Ridge National Laboratory
Completion of a 2000-curie cesium-137
gamma ray source was recently announced
by Arthur F. Rupp, Director of the Op-
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Laboratory. This is the second largeest
cesium-137 source to be produced at the
Laboratory, which is operated by Union
Qrbide Nuclear Company, a Division of
Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation
for the Atomic Energy Commission.
The first source, which contained 1540
, curies of cesium-137, was completed in
I 1954 and is now in use for medical re-
I search at the Oak Ridge Institute of Nu-
clear Studies. The second source will be
used in a fission-product utilization pro-
gram at the University of Michigan.
Qsium-137 is the most important long-
lived (about 30 years) gamma ray-emit-
ting isotope found in the by-products of
nuclear fission. It is expected that, in ad-
dition to the well-known medical applica-
tions, millions of curies will be used by
industry in the future for radiography,
pasteurization of foods and drugs, and
catalyzing chemical reactions.
Military Color TV
The Army Missile Test Center at Cape
Canaveral, Florida, recently witnessed the
first successful demonstration of closed-
circuit color television to observe firing of
ballistic missiles. According to the an-
nouncement made by the General Electric
Company's Broadcast Equipment Section
in Syracuse, New York, the demonstra-
tion afforded Army observes a close-up
view of actual variations in flash and
flame at the launching of a Redstone mis-
sile.
Prior to the color TV demonstration,
detailed and close-up visual observation
was next to impossible because of re-
quired safety precautions in the extreme-
variations of brightness as the missile was
fired. In the demonstration, the cameras
were mounted atop a concrete blockhouse
about 300 feet from the launching plat-
form. Monitors, or receivers, were viewed
within the safety of the blockhouse. The
need for observation through narrow,
tinted portholes, or through complicated
telescopes or transits was eliminated, as
were such factors as weather and atmo-
spheric conditions. Instead, the Army ob-
servers were able to obtain the precise
story on the disposition of fuel, which is
critical information for the launching and
control of missiles.
Oak Ridge Lab Completes Decade of
Radioisotope Production, Distribution
Another milestone in the atomic age
ivas passed in August when Oak Ridge
National Laboratory announced the com-
&gt;letion of its first 10 years of producing
The second largest cesium source produced by Oak Ridge National Laboratory was
completed in the remote-control cell shown above. This new 2000-curie cesium-137
gamma ray source will be used in a fission product utilization program at the Uni-
versity of Michigan.
and distributing radioisotopes for use in
medicine, industry, and agriculture. The
Laboratory, which is operated for the
Atomic Energy Commission by Union
Carbide Nuclear Company, a Division of
Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation,
made its first shipment of a fission-
produced radioisotope on August 2, 1946.
By the end of the Laboratory's first
year, over 280 shipments had been made
to 83 institutions which used them pri-
marily in fundamental research work. To-
day, over 2700 users throughout the
United States and 57 foreign countries
receive radioisotopes produced at the Lab-
oratory. The shipments made each month
amount to nearly five times the number
made during the program's entire first
year of operation. In all, a total of over
85,000 units have been distributed by
the Laboratory since the program's in-
ception in 1946.
The Atomic Energy Commission's ra-
dioisotope program at Oak Ridge Na-
tional Laboratory has fostered and intro-
duced a new phase of American indus-
try. Estimates of the total savings to in-
dustry alone resulting from radioisotope
applications have been placed at over
S200 million annually. Radioisotopes are
being used in radiography and radiation
damage studies by industry and for many

cal compounds, mechanical-wear tests, and
radiation chemistry research. Because of
their unique characteristics, they have
opened new doors in medical and biologi-
cal research.
To cope with the increasing demand
for radioisotopes, the Laboratory has had
to expand its facilities several times dur-
ing the past 10 years. From relatively
crude facilities have come modern proc-
essing units capable of producing highly
refined radiochemicals in quantities un-
dreamed of a decade ago.
Nearly 100 different radioisotopes are
now available from the Laboratory. Many
commercial firms purchase radioisotopes
in bulk quantities and reprocess them into
such forms as labeled compounds, certi-
fied pharmaceuticals, and custom-manu-
factured radiation devices. Thus a single
large unit of radioactivity from the Lab-
oratory may represent hundreds of ship-
ments to individual licensed customers.
Testing With TV
A small, rugged, bomb-shaped tele-
vision camera gives General Motors en-
gineers a picture of what goes on under-
neath an automobile when its cornering
sharply or bouncing over a rough test
road.
The picture is transmitted through a
closed TV circuit to a 14-inch monitoring
screen in the rear of the test car.
Engineers believe it is the best system
for quick answers in test work. Ordinarily
they would use motion picture cameras
for such visual aid in testing—and they
still do—but working with films is slow-
er and less flexible than live TV.
For watching the action of a car's sus-
pension system, a TV camera is attached
to the underside of a car's front or rear
bumper and focussed on the portion of
the suspension engineers wish to observe.
When the test is' under way, an en-
gineer observer sits in the back seat of
the car and watches the remote action
going on beneath him.
It is likewise possible to use such a
system with the picture flashed to a large
screen in an office or laboratory where a
group of engineers can sit and watch
the action on a car cruising along a test
road miles away, just as doctors watch
remote telecasts of surgical operations.
In addition to testing suspension sys-
tems in action, Engineering Staff men
also have used their mobile TV unit for
observing tire roll when a car is going
around a corner.
In other tests they have mounted a TV
"eye" beneath a car's hood. This helps
them observe engine "rock," fan blade
"bending" or action of throttle and choke-
controls.
With this technique they can team hot
metal Reset TV camera with a strobe light
that "stops" action of the engine fan
blades as they whirl.
Titanium Alloy Formed
At Room Temperature
Titanium alloy sheet can be formed on
conventional equipment at both room
temperature and high temperatures, Boe-
ing Airplane Company announced in
Seattle, Wash.
Boeing manufacturing research en-
gineers have found that at room tempera-
tures 6 A1-4V titanium can be formed in
a curve having a radius six times the
thickness of the material. Among opera-
tions possible at room temperatures are
sheet-roll-forming and stretch-forming of
sheets and sections.
At elevated temperatures 6 AI-4V
titanium alloy can be formed in a curve
having a radius three times the material
thickness.
Generally speaking, any shape that can
be formed in conventional aircraft ma-
terials can be formed in the titanium alloy
with conventional equipment, if the blank
can be heated to and maintained at a
sufficiently high temperature.
While certain problems connected with
the forming of titanium alloys remain
to be explored, the Boeing Airplane Com-
pany, by developing new methods or
adapting old methods and procedures, has
been able to form 6 A1-4V titanium in
the complex shapes necessary for airframe
production. Continuing research on re-
maining problems is progressing toward
the point where forming titanium may
well become a standard procedure in air-
frame production.
Electronics Produce
New Light Source
The first full-scale presentation of
man's newest light source—electronic
light—was made recently when Westing-
house Electric Corporation unveiled a
room lighted by electroluminescence.
Panels no thicker than window glass
line the ceiling and three walls, giving
off light (approximately 50 foot-candles)
equivalent to that in a modern, well-
lighted office or class room.
One hundred and twelve glass panels,
each one foot square in size and giving
off a soft green light, are used to illumi-
nate the room with shadowless light.
Walls and ceiling of the room are not
lighted, but are light, creating an at-
mosphere of light without light fixtures.
Also shown was how the housewife of
the future may have complete mastery

Last month's problem must have been
a good one; no correct solutions had been
submitted at the writing of this month's
Teasers. Remember, the names of all per-
sons who have submitted correct solu-
tions will be printed in the February is-
sue of the Technic. Possibly you had some-
trouble with the problem? Well, here is
the analysis. First we have 25 cations
from which to choose.
A yellow to red flame test eliminates
Cu and Ba (both green).
If Ag had been present it would have
reprecipitated with HCI.
Mercury must be absent or the filter
and/or the filtrate would have yielded a
black precipitate (through reduction by
ammonia).
The first sulfide precipitate was gray;
a yellow precipitate would have been par-
tially visible, but since it was not in evi-
dence, Cd, As, Sb, and Sn must have been
absent. The absence of a colored borax
bead test eliminated Co, Fe, Mn, and
Ni.
No precipitation from an acid solution
by NaOH eliminates Zn, Cr, AI. This
eliminates all of Group III.
After precipitating the carbonates the
solution was composed entirely of vol-
atile material. Hence the alkalies must be
absent. The absence of a flame test
through cobalt glass eliminates Sr. The
hydroxide precipitate was not affected by
p-nitrobenzeneazoresorcinol, hence Mg is
absent. This leaves only Pb, Bi, and Ca.
To complete the analysis it is necessary
to take these cations through the reactions.
Ca accounts for the yellow to red (or-
ange) flame test. Bi hydrolyzes and pre-
cipitates at a pH of 6. Pb is precipitated
as a chloride, and is soluble in either hot
water or strong base. Pouring HCI into
the alkaline filtrate would give a hot solu-
tion which keeps Pb from prec ipftaf,'n ,r
Bi hydrolyzes at a pH of 5. Hence the
first sulfide precipitate is solely one of Pb
which sulfide is (or may be) gray.
The second sulfide precipitate is both
Pb and Bi. Digestion on the filter with
NaOH dissolves Pb to a certain extent.
Neither Pb nor Bi will color a borax bead.
The sulfate ion will precipitate Pb, and
turbidity may be caused by a dilute solu-
tion of Pb. H..SO, might also oxidize the
small amount of sulfide ion present.
The filtrate after sulfide precipitation
will, of course, contain Ca, and since Pb
in strong base is present as the plumbitc
ion, Calcium plumbite will leave solu-
tion.
Calcium plumbite in acetic acid will
produce again the Pb ion as a cation
which precipitates with the addition of a
chromate. Since this is one of the tests
for Pb, step nine was a dead giveaway.
Carbon dioxide will precipitate Ca in
a basic solution. Pb and Bi will already
bi' out as hydroxides. Dissolving and re-
precipitating leaves Ca in solution and
its flame test is not visible through a
blue filter. S and O reagent does not col-
or the hydroxides of Pb and Bi. Thus the
analysis is complete. All the phenomena
may be attributed to just three ions: Bi
and Pb from Group II, and Ca from
Group IV. Simple, was it not?
So much for last month's troubles, here
is a whole new set for this month. As
though the campus were not already suf-
ficiently mixed up, the typewriter has not
been fixed yet. As a result here is what is
left of a famous poem written by—.
Well, that would be telling, but there will
be an answer next month.

Let us now emerge from the confusion
to a new problem. Suppose a 250 lb. man
pushes against a boy weighing 150 lbs.
when both are on skates at the center of
an ice pond. The average force is 48.3
lbs. and is exerted for I second. If then
the boy throws a 1 lb. ball to the man at
the end of two seconds time how fast is
the combined (of the man, the boy, and
the ball) center of gravity receding from
the center of the pond? Find this for be-
fore and after the ball is thrown, and for
before and after the ball is caught.
Now here is a nice long problem which
has nothing to do with astronomy in
spite of the figures. A man plays check-
ers. The king tells him that he must beat
him (the king) in a game of checkers in
order to gain a high reward. The reward
was to be gained in the following man-
ner. If the man won the first game he
would get 542,949,672.96. If he won the
second game he would get half as much
more. If he won the third game he would
gain half as much as before, and so on.
If the king would play as many games
as there were squares to play on, how
much does the man stand to gain at most
(to the nearest cent)?

cal system. The genetic damage done by
radiation is cumulative." The article goes
on to mention "increased susceptibilities
either to postnatal diseases or to embry-
onic deformities."
Thirty pregnant women were subjected
to radiation at Nagasaki and lived to tell
of it; only sixteen children survived birth,
of which four were mentally retarded.
How much of this is ascribable to direct
radiation reaching the unborn child, and
how much to generally reduced health of
the mother is problematical. However,
there are other indications that the brains
of the unborn are especially sensitive to
radiation at some stages. In rats, the re-
sults have been found to include mental
deficiency, blindness, and either abnorm-
ally large or abnormally small heads. The
abnormally small head seemed to be the
most prevalent reaction.
Biological effects of radiation are ac-
complished, for the most part, through
ionization of cellular matter, that is, elec-
trons are removed from the atoms in
these cells. As density of ions in tissues
increases, so does the severity of the ef-
fects. Beta and gamma radiations produce
about 11 ions per micron of tissue, while
neutrons will cause up to 9,000 ions in
the same amount of tissue, according to
the Science News Letter for July 28, 1956.
The National Academy of Sciences has
come up with two recommendations, both
aimed primarily at the use of medical
X-rays, which are the most prevalent ex-
posure of humans to radiation. One of
these is a national system for ticketing
each citizen's exposure to controlled rad-
iation. The other asks that the amount of
controlled radiation reaching the repro-
ductive system be reduced to the amount
required by medical necessity.
Not all of the harmful effects of radi-
ation are genetic. Even disregarding the
mass slaughter unavoidable in atomic war-
fare, there are serious effects to survivors.
The Atomic Energy Commission, upon
completion of a two-year check-up on sur-
vivors of the 1954 H-bomb tests, reports
that 15 of 64 people suffering effects of
beta and gamma radiation still have skin
disorders. While these show no malig-
nancy, and the people do not seem to be
affected by leukemia or cancer, these arc-
still considered a possibility. Clotting of
these people's blood remains below norm-
al.
Then, too, the genetic effects of radi-
ation do not only affect man. Professor
'Espinasse expresses the fear the micro-
organisms which now are not harmful to
the human being or his domestic animals
may become so through radiation effects.
In this case, the high multiplication rate,
the asexual nature of the "beasties," and
the great number of such organisms of
any one type available to radiation make
this a startling possibility.
There is by no means general agree-
ment in predictions of harmful results of
various radioactive activities. One hesi-
tates to accept any estimate for the future
without first requesting much more in-
formation.
"Forward, Forward, Let Us Range"
Many of the research workers and
M.D.s qualified to work with radioiso-
topes have received their training at the
Oak Ridge Institute of Nuclear Sciences.
However, for the current outlook on nu-
clear science, these are pitifully few. The
Atomic Energy Commission has ap-
proached Congress for authorization to
forge ahead along educational lines. In
September, 1956, representatives from
150 colleges and universities were in-
vited to an AEC-sponsored conference at
Gatlinburg, Tennessee. They were to dis-
cuss recent developments and to hear of
the AEC educational program.
The pharmaceutical houses are working
on various phases of the radioisotope pic-
ture, some processing radioisotopes, oth-
ers, like Parke, Davis, and Company, in-
vestigating the harmful effects.
Only two American universities had
working atomic reactors by September of
1956: Pennsylvania State University and
Virginia Polytechnic Institute. By the first
of the year, it was expected that the Uni-
versity of Michigan, Batelle Memorial
Institute, the Armour Research Founda-
tion, and the University of California at
Los Angeles would have reactors for
training and/or research purposes. Two
more are expected to be under way in
1957, one at the University of Buffalo,
and the other at the Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology. About six other in-
stitutions have announced plans for train-
ing facilities on some scale or other.
The reactor at MIT is designed espe-
cially for medical research and therapy.
Peculiar to this installation, now under
construction for something over $2 mil-
lion, is a beam of neutrons and gamma
rays directed downward. This places the
fully equipped operating room directly
under the reactor. Its uses will include
treatment for cancer of the brain and
other tumors, studies of gamma ray and
neutron effects on living tissues, and the
first New England supply of short-lived
isotopes produced by neutrons. A grant of
S 500,000 from the National Science
Foundation and another of $250,000
from the Rockefeller Foundation are go-
ing towards its construction.
The UCLA reactor is designed for
medical research and treatment and is
being built by the Nuclear Engineering
and Manufacturing Division of North
American Aviation. Approximately four
gallons of uranyl sulphate solution rich
in U-235 contained in a one foot stain-
less steel sphere will provide through fis-
sion the gamma rays and neutrons needed
for the various phases of research and
treatment. The self-contained reactor is
designed to operate at a power level of
5 kilowatts, and will produce no radio-
active wastes. It is expected to be useful
in treating cancers, providing short-lived
isotopes, research on animals, and ex-
perimentation in sterilization and preser-
vation of foodstuffs and drugs.
In supplying the necessary quantity of
neutrons for forming isotopes, the co-
operation of the Canadians in using their
reactor at Chalk-River, Ontario has been
secured. This reactor uses heavy water in-
stead of graphite rods for slowing down
neutrons, and supposedly provides neu-
trons at about ten times the rate of
graphite-controlled reactors, as a conse-
quence.
Just how much hope does atomic en-
ergy hold for man and his good health?
Just how dark a picture are we justified
in painting, when we look at the long
range effects of an increased radiation
level? In these areas there exist many
questions, and mainly only half-answers—
today. Steps are being taken to increase
informed manpower, to provide additional
facilities for research, and with these fa-
cilities to expand the world's knowledge
so that tomorrow there will be more an-
swers.

in the field of Combustion"
Historically, the process of combus-
tion has excited man's insatiable
hunger for knowledge. Since his
most primitive attempts to make
use of this phenomenon, he has
found tremendous fascination in its
potentials.
Perhaps at no time in history has
that fascination been greater than
it is today with respect to the use
of combustion principles in the
modern aircraft engine.
At Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft,
theorems of many sciences are being
applied to the design and develop-
ment of high heat release rate de-
vices. In spite of the apparent sim-
plicity of a combustion system, the
bringing together of fuel and air in
proper proportions, the ignition of
the mixture, and the rapid mixing
of burned and unburned gases in-
volves a most complex series of
interrelated events — events ocur-
ring simultaneously in time and
space.
Although the combustion engi-
neer draws on many fields of science
(including thermodynamics, aero-
dynamics, fluid mechanics, heat
transfer, applied mechanics, metal-
lurgy and chemistry), the design of
combustion systems has not yet
been reduced to really scientific
principles. Therefore, the highly
successful performance of engines
like the J-57, J-75 and others stands
as a tribute to the vision, imagina-
tion and pioneering efforts of those
at Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft en-
gaged in combustion work.
While combustion assignments,
themselves, involve a diversity of
engineering talent, the field is only
one of a broadly diversified engi-
neering program at Pratt &amp; Whitney
Aircraft. That program—with other
far-reaching activities in the fields
of instrumentation, materials prob-
lems, mechanical design and aero-
dynamics — spells out a gratifying
future for many of today's engi-
neering students.
Mounting an afterburner in a special high-altitude test
chamber in P&amp;WA's Willgoos Turbine Laboratory permits
study of a variety of combustion problems which
may be encountered during later development stages.
Microflash photo illustrates one continuing
problem: design and development of fuel
injection systems which properly atomize
and distribute under all flight conditions.

Designed for use in missile and high

be used for more conventional aerial re-
connaissance tasks.
Known as the KA-20, the camera uses
9 x 9-inch film and a 6-inch metrogen
lens to provide a maximum area of cov-
erage. It weighs only 20 lbs., one-fifth
the weight of comparable aerial cameras
Built-in Image Motion Compensation,

in all types of aerial platforms, both
manned and unmanned, where weight is
a critical problem.
Missile and rocket use is completth

Walt Wagner, MIT '49, Tells How
McGraw-Hill Editors Combine Writing and Engineering
Meet Walt Wagner—SB and SM in Business and Engineering Administra-
tion . . . and an editor who never wrote a word for publication before he joined
McGraw-Hill! Today, barely six years out of college, Walt is near the top of
his chosen profession as Assistant Managing Editor of FACTORY—the
McGraw-Hill Publishing Company's magazine for production-minded en-
gineers and plant-operating executives.
Let Walt tell you how this successful and challenging career of his came
about:
During my last year at MIT, I often wondered whether
could use my background and training in some field
ther than engineering alone. Since FACTORY was one
P our more important classroom texts, I wrote to the
iitors for guidance. After considerable correspondence
rid meetings with members of the editorial staff, I was
ffered a job as an editorial assistant on the magazine.
Why I Like An Engineering-Writing Career
There are many reasons for my liking my career as an
igineering-writer. After thorough training, the editor
arted me on a couple of major feature stories. Later,
was sent to Chicago where, as Western Field Editor,
visited more than 100 plants of every type and size.
"I worked with keen, alert men in front offices and
side the plants of America's leading industries. I was
ght there interviewing for the story, as new industrial
ivances were made. I wrote on new production tech-
iques, new systems, new processes, new labor and
anagement ideas. In short—the new frontiers in en-
ineering.
"In 1954 I was appointed Assistant Managing .Editor
I FACTORY. Today, I work mainly on big engineering
aries—play a major part along with another Assistant
lanaging Editor, the Editor and the Managing Editor
i the complete planning of the magazine.
"That's the story—and it's one of the reasons why
m glad I found a way to put my engineering training
&gt; work for me."

So l/ou Tkink SJti Mew . . .
As you enter a large building on a hu-
mid day in the summer, you might mar-
vel at the pleasant, cool air on the in-
side, thinking what a wonderful thing
"modern" science is. But the truth of the
matter is a ventilating system for an en-
tire building was first put in use way
back in 1752. The following is an
abridged description of the ventilating
system used in Newgate Prison from
Gentlemen Magazine published in April
of 1752:
Two pair of these ventilators are laid
on each other, as in Fig. I abed. The mid-
riffs of both ventilators are to be moved
up and down by the flat iron rods ef,
which have a joint at /, where they are
fixed to the midriffs, then passing through
the upper part of the lower ventilator,
and through the bottom of the upper
ventilator; this plate is to be covered by
another broader iron plate, which is to be
screwed fast to the bottom of the upper
ventilator. The iron rods of both sides
of the ventilators being fixed to one com-
mon lever at ee, all the four midriffs are
thereby alternately worked up and down
at the same time.
The circular ends of the ventilators, as
well as all other parts, are fastened with
wood screws daubed with grease to pre-
vent their rusting in the wood, so that
any part can be taken off commodiously,
to rectify any failure in them.
A very large nose, (Fig. 2) js jfixecJ
with iron hooks kk to the ventilators at //.
The nose is divided into three spaces. The
middle or largest of these spaces, mm, re-
ceives all the foul air which is blown in
from the eight middle valves xxxx,
whence it passes through a trunk //, into
the open air. The top of this trunk is
covered with weatherboards to keep the
rain out; the middle valves xxxx hang so
as to open outwards.
The two other outer spaces, or parti-
tions, of the nose, pp, draws in the foul
air from the several wards through the
trunks and passes it off into the ventila-
tors through the eight outer valve-holes,
ww, whose valves are hung so as to open
inwards.
The several branching trunks are to be
opened and shut as it shall be found
proper to ventilate or not ventilate the
several wards in their turns.
The ventilators are fixed in an upper
room of Newgate, in order to be near the
windmill on the leads, which works them.
From each of the outer nostrils, there
goes a trunk, which passes along on each
side of the open area over the gate way,
but at some distance from the sides of
the area. And then descends through all
the floors as far as a little below the ceil-
ing of the ground rooms; and are covered
with plate iron within the reach of the
prisoners.
These branching trunks are to extend
more or less int0 tne several wards, in
such manner, that when the foul air is
drawn out of any ward, the fresh air may
enter on the opposite side; and by that
means drive all the foul air out before it.
And in case there are several inlets for
fresh air on opposite sides of the same
ward, then the trunk reaches to the mid-
dle of the ceiling of such a ward.
So that many wards may be ventilated
at the same time there are sliding shut-
ters with long handles, which slide up
and down. This also allows the closing of
some wards entirely while others are vent-
ilating. The handles of these sliders
locked fast, so that prisoners can't shut or
open them. In order to find out in what
proportion to close the sliding shutters
the trunks of the several wards that are
to be ventilated at the same time, it will
be necessary at first to tie a lighted can-
dle at the end of a pole, and hold it at
the mouths of the trunks, thereby to make
some estimate of the quantity of foul air
that is drawn into the several trunks.
By this means, all the wards may be
ventilated in turns, in such proportions
as shall by experience be found most con-
venient.
Although many improvements have
been made in ventilating systems since
that time, such as no longer using wind-
mills as a power source, the basic prin-
ciple is the same as our "modern" win-
dow ventilators and fans. So you thought
it was something new?

ATOMIC ENERGY AND
CHEMISTRY
After the first atomic reactors were
built, it was discovered that radiation had
interesting effects upon the chemical and
physical properties of the materials from
which the reactors were constructed. "Ra-
diation damage" was the original name
for such changes, since they were not' de-
sirable from the standpoint of reactor
operators. However, study of "radiation
damage" has led to an entire new field of
chemical research. Changes in materials,
which are not desirable in a reactor, may
have many applications in other areas.
The changes, due to radiation, of the
chemical properties may be divided into
two main groups: 1) Organic compounds
2) Valance compounds and metals.
Gamma rays and fast neutrons, be-
cause of their ionizing abilities, are the
only forms of nuclear radiations that will
be considered in this article. Fast neutrons
are available only near reactors. Gamma
radiation can be had from: 1) fission
products 2) cobalt which has been irra-
diated in an atomic pile 3) high energy
X-ray machines and electron accelerators.
(X-rays are equivalent to gamma rays.)
The effects that radiation has on a
material is determined by the relation
that the electrons have in the structure of
the material. Although gamma rays and
fast neutrons are absorbed differently in
matter, they produce similar effects.
Gamma rays give up most of their energy
in collisions with electrons. Fast neutrons,
on the other hand, lose their energy in
collisions with the atomic nuclei. The re-
sult of both types is ionization and elec-
tronic excitation. If the electrons are pair-
ed as they are in organic materials, the
kinetic energy, which is imparted on them,
is often enough to break the chemical
bonds. The chemical bonds are much
harder to disturb in valance compounds
and metals.
Physical Changes of Irradiated
Organic Materials
Radiation produces changes in colora-
tion and molecular weight Polymers and
hydrocarbons with a carbon-carbon main
chain usually become yellowish or brown-
ish after being irradiated. Organic dyes
change their color. Polyethylene loses its
property of being translucent and becomes
transparent instead. Radiation usually
causes organic materials to have higher or
lower molecular weights.
Electrical properties of materials are
also altered. As was previously stated,
ionization is one of the immediate effects
of the radiation. Electrical conductivity
can be decreased or increased by a factor
of ten, depending on certain variables.
Radiation dose, dose rate, temperature,
impurities, and whether the measurements
are made during irradiation determine the
changes that are made in conductivity.
Increases in the power factor of irra-
diated polyethylenes have been observed
at room temperature and low and medium
frequencies. However, there is little
change in the more common insulating
varnishes. Radiation doses as high as 10s
roentgens were applied to Formex, poly-
ethylene, cellulose-acetate, and polyvinyl
chloride. There were no marked changes
in breakdown voltages observed for the
first three, but major improvement was
found with polyvinyl chloride.
Changes in the Chemical Properties of
Organic Materials
Irradiated organic materials react in two
general ways. Some knit together their
molecules to form larger molecules in a
process known as polymerization. Others
reduce their relatively large molecules into
simpler groups, a process which is called
degredation. The tendency toward one or
the other is determined by the structure of
the material and the chemical environment
of the material.
Polymerization is the first general proc-
ess to be considered. When a liquid
hydrocarbon is irradiated, it becomes more

color of many organic materials. Often
the color of irradiated polymeric mater-
ials is some shade of yellow or brown.
Organic dyes may also be discolored by
radiation.

viscous. With sufficient radiation, it can
be converted into a solid. This property
could be highly unfortunate in an atomic
aircraft engine which used a hydrocarbon
as a lubricant.
However, polymerization is often de-
sirable. In the plastics field, particularly,
it is desirable to have plastics polymerize.
Currently, polymerization of plastics is
accomplished by using heat, pressure, and
catalysts. Radiation can make plastics
polymerize much more simply. Also, a
group of University of Michigan scientists
presented a paper to the Geneva Confer-
ence in 1955, describing an isomer of
Benzene Hexacloride which was produced
by irradiation. The cost of production by
irradiation of this chemical, an insecti-
cide, compares favorably to that of the
present industrial method.
It seems likely to produce polymers
that are different from those which can
be produced by conventional methods.
The fragments and radicals, that are
knocked off, are usually short lived. By
keeping the materials at low temperature,
the radicals may be stored for later use.
Besides polymerizing simple molecules,
radiation can sometimes cause larger
molecules to join together in a process
which is known as crosslinking. Materials
produced by crosslinking are usually rath-
er different than the original materials.
For example, let us consider polyethy-
lene. Under normal conditions, polyethy-
lene is a thermoplastic, melting at 115°C.
After the material has absorbed about
twenty million roentgens, it becomes one
super molecule and does not flow at
115°C. Besides greater heat resistance, the
the polyethylene resists attacks of sol-
vents which could dissolve the original
material. The changes in properties of
such materials may have many commer-
cial applications.
The other major way that organic ma-
terials react to radiation, as was mentioned
earlier, is degredation. Materials arc-
broken down into their radicals and frag-
ments which do not combine or form
longer chains. An example of this type is
a plastic called polymethyl methacrylate.
Both the side chains and main polymer
chains are broken by radiation, liberating
a relatively large volume of gas. If the
material is slightly heated, it will expand
in foam bubbles to a mass of five to ten
times the original volume.
Another feature of degredation is the
formation of corrosive materials. A plas-
tic, polytetrafluoroethylene reacts in this
manner. Ordinarily, the material is ex-
tremely resistant to high temperatures and
chemical attack. But, after mild irradi-
ation, undesirable qualities appear. The
material becomes very brittle, breaking
when it is bent slightly. The flurocar-
bons, that are formed in the degredation
process, corrode the materials with which
it is in contact. An insulator for wires,
teflon, peels off and corrodes the wire,
when exposed to mild radiation.
Cellulose is weakened by radiation.
Wood, paper, and cellulose products lose
their physical strength as well as being
discolored. White paper becomes a
charred yellow after being exposed to
mild radiation. Important to note is the
fact, that with continued irradiation,
cellulose becomes soluble in water.
Though some materials may polymer-
ize and crosslink initially, they will even-
tually be broken up by degredation, if
they are subjected to radiation for long
periods of time. Structural effects are im-
portant in the way a material reacts. For
example, unsaturations in the molecule
enhance the chances of polymerization.
The presence of a halogen in a material
often means that the material will under-
go degredation when irradiated. The ex-
perimental results from irradiation tend
to agree with theoretical ideas about
bonds and the attractive force between
paired electrons.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


(Continued from page 33)
Environmental factors which influence
the course of the changes are: 1) tem-
perature, 2) presence of oxygen, and 3)
presence of water.
It is generally believed that temper-
ature does seem to change the secondary
reactions, changing the ways in which
the split-off radicals and fractions recom-
bine. For example, the sizes of the mole-
cules, induced by radiation-polymeriza-
tion, increase as the temperature in-
creases.
The presence of oxygen brings about
deterioration of strips of rubber as it is
irradiated. The effects of oxygen are
greatest when a large, thin surface is ex-
posed to it. It is thought that the greatest
part of the reaction is done by ozone, de-
veloped by the radiation.
Irradiated water contains both reducing
and oxidizing chemicals. Therefore, the
addition of water to an irradiated system
adds more chemicals to an already highly
reactive system, and can not be easily cal-
culated. In some experiments, water has
been used as a medium for carrying out
polymerizations by irradiations.
Effects of Radiation on Metals and
Valence Compounds
Metals and valence compounds behave
somewhat differently, when irradiated,
than do organic compounds. Fast neutrons
make great changes in the lattice struc-
ture of metals and crystaline materials.
Atoms are knocked from their position in
the lattice. The recoiling atoms collide
with other atoms and the structure of the
crystal is altered. For example, a fast
neutron, traveling in graphite, knocks off
60 carbon atoms before its energy is lost.
Each of the carbon atoms does consider-
able damage to the structure of the
crystal.
After irradiation, some of the atoms
are left between planes of atoms and do
not immediately rejoin the lattice. They
are called "intersitial" atoms. If a ma-
terial is heated, the number of intersitial
atoms decreases. This is to be expected,
since the intersitial atoms have a better
chance to find an empty spot in the lattice-
as the molecules move around as heat.
The intersitial atoms represent a source of
potential energy. It has been suggested
that irradiated graphite be used as a type
of storage battery, storing energy in the
form of intersitial atoms.
Some materials develop unusual prop-
erties. Metals and compounds, such as
sodium chloride, are made brittle by ir-
radiation. A copper rod will make little
sound if it is struck by a piece of wood.
However, the same copper, after irradi-
ation, will make a sound that is much
like that from a tuning fork. The beryl-
lium oxide moderator of the Materials
Testing Reactor of the AEC swelled by
about 1 per cent on the first day. The
expansion did not continue linearly, but
was much less than 10 per cent after ten
days. The material retracted to some of
its original size after being allowed to
"rest." The tendencies of irradiated me-
tals to swell and become brittle compli-
cates the task of reactor building.
Metals lose their tendency to conduct
electricity and heat after they have been
irradiated. Copper, a nearly ideal metal,
quickly regains its old properties. In or-
der to "freeze in" all of the defects that
are caused by radiation, copper must be
kept at a temperature that is near ab-
solute zero.
This brief investigation of the changes
that occur in the chemical properties of
irradiated materials demonstrates the wide
area of chemical research which is con-
nected with radiation. In the next few
years, many new processes and products
will be developed with the aid of radio-
activity. Old reactions will be simplified.
Irradiation of organic chemicals will give
us invaluable knowledge of these com-
plex reactions.

"Here are some of the facts about Honeywell that
have been of real interest to the young engineering
graduates we talk to."

HONEYWELL IS A GROWTH COMPANY!
A growth company is one where men move ahead be-
cause of opportunity and challenge . . . where problems
are turned into progress . . . where employment, sales
and income increase steadily year after year.
Honeywell, today's world leader in the automatic
control field, is such a company. For the past 30 years,
sales have doubled or tripled every five years ($1,084,-
259 in 1926; 5244,482,068 in 1955). Employment has
increased from 720 to over 25,000 in the same period,
and net earnings have climbed from $424,241 to
$19,278,648.
This healthy growth of Honeywell is shown in the
table below.
The future is even more challenging. Planned diver-
sification puts Honeywell in such new fields as office and
factory automation, process control, transistors, plas-
tics, atomic energy, electronics, missiles and satellites.
Honeywell has the proven skills to design, engineer and
build the equipment required by an increasingly auto-
matic world and to sell its products profitably.
RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING ARE
IMPORTANT AT HONEYWELL!
Research, design-development and product engineering
are indispensable for continued growth. Honeywell's
research and engineering have advanced twice as fast
as growth in sales.
Honeywell's growth from a small thermostat com-
pany has been stimulated by research. And today re-
search and development work in metallurgy, ceramics,
heat transfer, plastics, vacuum tubes, ultrasonics,
magnetic materials, semi-conductors, and combustion
suggests new growth. Never in history has the potential
of these and similar Honeywell development programs
looked so promising.

power. Without its constant supply of
energy the earth would soon become a
desolate wasteland. In an area of two
hundred square miles, there is enough
energy absorbed to supply the world with
sufficient power for its entire consumption
at its present rate.
What is happening to all this energy?
Is the world using this vast resource to its
best advantage?
These are the very questions that have
been bothering physicists, physical chem-
ists, engineers and economists. They real-
ize that present fossil fuel sources may be
used up within the next fifty qears.
When this crisis arises there must be
another source of power to take its place.
Because of the vast supply of energy pro-
vided by the sun science has long sought
to convert solar energy into mechanical,
electrical, or even chemical energy so
that it might be best utilized.
In an effort to bring about such a
utilization of the sun's energy, a World
Symposium on Applied Solar Energy was
held in November, 1955. Thirty-one na-
tions were represented and 130 papers
and addresses were delivered. The type of
conversion to be used fell into three main
categories:
( 1) Thermo conversion processes
(2) Electric conversion processes
(3) Photo chemical processes
Thermo conversion processes:
There are two schools of thought on
how the sun's energy should be converted
by JAMES STEVENS, '59E
to useable heat, the flat plate collectors
and the concentrators.
The flat plate collectors are those who
try to reproduce the hot house effect by
absorbing radiation on a dark surface and
then trapping the radiations by insula-
tion and glass cover plates. This method
has long been employed in what is known
as Solar Heated" houses. A number of
these houses have been built as test
houses in various parts of the country.
From these experiments it has been shown
that with an auxiliary heater or a storage
bin, the home can be comfortably heated
with little or no additional cost. The
major factor is the high initial cost. Such
a heating unit costs slightly over S4,0(X&gt;
for a small home, a figure which few
people are going to part with readily.
On a smaller scale a practical solar
water heater has been put on the market.
Various tests on the product show an
energy conversion factor of about 50 per
cent in the range from 50° to 70 C. But
once above this range the efficiency de-
creases to where it is only 10% at 100 C.
This type of heater naturally has its limi-
tations. By using selective plates rather
than glass plates, a higher efficiency and
higher temperatures can be obtained; but
this adds to the already high initial cost.
Another application of the principle
was put into effect by an Italian inventor
to make a solar pump. He used an ordin-
ary fiat plate collector to vaporize sulfur
dioxide which drives a simple one cylin-
der motor that is cooled by the pumped
water. The pump converts solar energy

cent efficiency.
The second school of thought, the con-
centrators, believe that the answer to prac-
tical conversions of solar energy lies in
numerous reflectors concentrating the heat
of the sun on one central spot. The tem-
peratures that can be obtained by this
method range from 100° to 3500° C.
People have used this idea for centuries
simply by starting fires with convex lens.
A solar cooker, which employs this
method for heat, has been retailing for
S15. The major difficulty with selling such
a cooker is that if people want to eat out
of doors the use of charcoal or wood is
much more picnic-like. The use of the
solar heater is also limited to day time and
nice weather.
On the other hand certain Russian in-
dustrialists felt that the idea was worth
the effort. One of that delegation reports
the building of a large central black ball
which is filled with water. A number of
mirrors are placed to direct the heat to-
ward the ball. A large mirror is mounted
on a railroad car to follow the sun and
catch its radiations. In this manner the
black ball reaches very high temperatures
and the resulting steam is pumped off into
homes for heating purposes. The major
difficulty with such a system is the con-
tinuous tracking of the sun by the auxil-
iary mirror. The amount of energy that
must be employed to move the railroad
car is often not much less than the energy
obtained in heat. If this were the sole
source of energy another difficulty would
arise in adopting it to the American way
of life. At noon when the sun's radiations
are most easily caught, the load would be
relatively light; but in the evening when
everyone is home for dinner, the amount
of available heat will be at its lowest
point. During the winter months the sun
often sets by five o'clock which means no
energy sources whatsoever after this hour.
Electric Conversion processes:
Instead of trying to convert the sun's
energy to heat, there are many who feel
we should concentrate on converting it to
electrical energy. The manner to be used
in this conversion is even more contro-
versial than that to be used for the con-
version to heat. The three most significant
means of conversion for solar energy are
the photo voltaic cell, thermocouples, and
the photogalvanic cell.
A great deal of progress has been made
with the photovoltaic cell. This cell works
on the same principle that the electric
eye works, namely light is absorbed on a
screen of material that is sensitive to it.
The result is a potential difference which
causes an electron flow. The cell can then
be attached to a circuit as an ordinary bat-
tery would.
The Bell Laboratories, experimenting
with this principle have invented a solar
battery using silicon crystals, with a small
amount of arsenic impurity. The crystals
are about 1-inch in diameter and 0.04
inches thick. When Bell first started work-
ing with the battery in their labs, the
conversion efficiency was less than 6%.
At last report the battery had attained an
11 % efficiency. To give it a more practi-
cal test, Bell Telephone Company is now
using a battery made up of 24 cells to
charge storage batteries for line amplifiers
near Americus, Georgia. The cost of pro-
ducing electricity using this battery in the
lab was about $140/kilowatt hour. The
cost of flashlight batteries is $23.70/kilo-
watt hour. But the economist feels that
mass producing the battery will bring
down its cost a hundred or even a thous-
and fold. If this is true, the battery could
well compete with popular type batteries
in use today.
The same principle has been used in
another solar battery being tested at the
present time but with less publicity. The
major difference in the two is the material
used. A cadmium sulfide cell has produced
a 1 % efficiency in converting solar energy
to electricity. Although the efficiency is
much less than that of the Bell Battery,
the expense of the material would be
lower. Cadmium telluride, gallium arsen-
ide, and indium phosphite have produced
higher efficiencies than cadmium sulfide,
but again these materials cost more. You
could get higher conversion efficiency at
a higher cost, but the same effect might be
produced by using more of the cheaper
type batteries.
The second type of solar-electrical con-
vertor is the thermocouple. Using titanium
dioxide as semiconductors an efficiency of
1% at 550 K was obtained. The great
advantage of this method is the low cost

of materials for the thermocouples. But
the larger disadvantages of the low effi-
ciency and exacting conditions of opera-
tion makes its value doubtful, although
further experiments are being performed.
The third method of converting solar
to electrical energy is the photogalvanic
cell. This is the type of cell that causes
current to flow by the different electrical
potentials of the materials In the specific-
experiment pointed out at the Symposium
a prototype photogalvanic cell with a
counter cell of a graphite-oxygen electrode
and with photogalvanic half cell, a cop-
per- copper oxide cell, developed an effi-
ciency of 0.1%. Although it can be seen
that the efficiency is very low, the cost is
practically nothing because there is no
consumption of electrode or electrolyte.
This fact alone makes the project worth
looking into in the future
Pholo-Cbemical Processes:
The third field into which much investi-
gation has gone is the chemical conversion
of materials by the effect of sunlight.
One group advocates the photochemical
breakdown of water under exposure to
sunlight. Various organic and inorganic
photocatalysrs, which will absorb sunlight
and transmit the absorbed energy to a sec-
ond reactant that will initiate the decom-
position of the water, have been tried. In
this reaction, the photocatalyst and all
other reagents are regenerated so that only
water is consumed. If a successful method
is devised, a maximum efficiency of from
30% to 40% can be expected. The ad-
vocates of this method point out three of
its advantages.
(1) Collecting surface can be relatively
simple.
(2) Hydrogen can be stored easily
and cheaply.
(3) Hydrogen can be converted into
electric energy at very high efficiency in
hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells such as those
being developed in England.
The difficulty that the advocates of this
method are having is the small propor-
tion of hydrogen yielded to the theoreti-
cal amount that should be produced.
Although not strictly photochemical the
researchers in this field are gravely wor-
ried about the insufficient food supply in
the world. Even if all the food were gath-
ered in one place and distributed evenly
among all the inhabitants of the world
there would not be adequate diets for all.
One way in which science hopes to
alleviate part of this problem is through
solar stills. The solar still is a simple ap-
paratus that is filled on one side with
polluted or foul water The sun then
evaporates the water up to a condensor
where it is liquified and is stored in an-
other part of the still. The still was in-
vented for use by people stranded on the
ocean with no fresh water supply. It is
very useful for small amounts of water but
cannot be used on a large scale. Experi-
ments to work out irrigation methods with
it have thus far proved unsuccessful but
it has produced drinking water where
previously none was available
Another way in which science is trying
to lessen the food problem is through
reflectors. By directing the sunshine where
they want it, farmers are able to have
longer growing seasons and reduce frost
danger.
Although we often sit back and enjoy
the advantages that science has offered us
in the past and expect the same for the
future, it is well to note that science can't
sit back. Coal, gas, and oil are adequate
fuels for the present but their existence is
fast fading. A new source of power must
take the place of the fossil fuels. Granted
the atomic energy reactors of today may
solve a great majority of these problems
of energy sources but the expense of
building such plants limits them to popu-
lous city areas and industrial centers. The
smaller communities will have to depend
on a less extravagant layout for its power.
Solar energy will most likely be the only
source on which these smaller communi-
ties will be able to depend.
The author of "Utilizing Solar Energy," James Stevens, is a
sophomore in the Chemical Engineering curriculum. While his
first year with the Technic was spent as a member of the
publications staff, Jim has now turned his interests toward writing.
Jim wrote for the school paper while at St. Charles High
School in Detroit and his scholastic ability there led him to attain
recognition as an Evans Scholar. For the future, Jim plans to enter
the chemical industry with an inclination to branch off into ma-
terials engineering.

assembled into bundles of 100 rods each;
the assembly is made by mechanically fas-
tening together a stack of seven bundles,
each 10 inches long, for a total of about
six feet. Provisions are made for remov-
ing any individual seed or blanket assem-
bly. The area above the pressure-vessel
head is flooded with water during the re-
moval operation, and the assembly is
transferred to the fuel canal, with this wa-
ter acting as shielding. Provisions are al-
so made for removing the reactor vessel
head and then removing the entire core
as a unit, or any assemblies as desired.
A major problem in the operation of a
nuclear-power plant is the difficulty ot
determining exactly what is taking place
within the reactor vessel with respect to
the coolant flow, boiling of the coolant,
temperature of the fuel elements, or fail-
ure of these elements. Suitable instruments
for making these determinations are there-
fore provided.
The seed assemblies contain a total ot
52 kilograms of enriched U,SI, and the
blanket contains twelve tons of uranium
in the form of UO,. At the start of re-
actor life, approximately 60 per cent of
the power will be produced in blanket
assemblies and -40 per cent in the seed
assemblies. The power distribution is
a function of reactor life, inasmuch the
reactivity of both the seed and blanket
vary with reactor life. The percentage ot
power produced in the blanket is ex-

pected to increase with time. Obviously,
power distribution is also a function of
the reactor temperature and the position
of the control rods. In this reactor, most
of the power comes from the fissioning
of U"\ However, approximately 8 per
cent comes from the fast fissioning of
U"8, and a substantial fraction from the
fissioning of plutonium. At the start of
life, approximately .8 atoms of plutonium
are formed for each atom of U235 that is
fissioned.
The reactivity will vary throughout the
life of the reactor core, tending to in-
crease during the early part of the re-
actor life, and then decrease. The highly
enriched assemblies must be replaced at
least once to get maximum life out of the
uranium-oxide blanket assemblies.
Atomic fuel will be sent to the Ship-
pingport plant as needed from the AEC's
laboratory at Arco, Idaho, where the
submarine "Nautilus's" engine was per-
fected. It will be shipped in heavy lead
casks with walls several inches thick.
Each package with its wrappings will
occupy an entire railroad car. For this
reason, a rail spur is to be built to the
plant's huge fuel vaults which will be
filled with water 35 feet deep. A section
of the vault is to be used for so-called
atomic ashes"—material which has been
fissioned but still carries a dangerous
amount of radioactivity. When this is re-
moved to make way for a fresh supply,
it will be stored for return to Arco in

the water-filled vaults, protected by 5-foot
thick concrete walls. New material is to
be stored in a similar vault until it is put
in the atomic engine.
The reactor plant will be controlled to
maintain a constant average temperature
of the primary coolant. Therefore, the
control method used is one of average-
temperature error detection and correc-
tion. On-oflf control of rods is initiated at
plus or minus 3°F. error. Because of the
slow response of the temperature-sensing
elements and of heat transfer around the
loops, the corrective action of the control
would produce overshoot, and oscillation
of the system would result. For this rea-
son, a damping effect is provided by in-
corporating the rate of nuclear level
change into the control signal. Presump-
tively, this operation is controlled through
some sort of feed-back system which will
become manual at the will of an oper-
ator. Temperature measurements for the
control system are made by resistance
thermometers in the loops, and are re-
corded at boiler and reactor exits and av-
eraged.
This, then, in a nutshell, is the story
of the first full-scale atomic power plant
in this country. The Fermi plant, in es-
sence, will be little changed. It is newer
by two years on the drafting boards, and
certain aspects will be more modern. For
example, as was mentioned earlier, it will
house a breeder reactor which will pro-
duce more fissionable material than it
consumes. Also, it employs sodium as the
primary coolant in place of the water used
conventionally.
The design, construction, and operation
of these full-scale nuclear-power plants
will provide much knowledge in the
fields of reactor physics, fuel-element and
core technology, and component and
system design. By actually designing,
manufacturing, operating, and maintain-
ing the full-scale components required for
such power plants as the two presented
here, future plants of a similar type can
be developed and evaluated with greater
accuracy. The plant organization will
serve as a pattern for the establishment
of operation forces for nuclear-power sta-
tions, and the facility will also provide
training for the personnel for future
plants.

How often
does Du Pont
transfer
technical men?
Fred v. Wolford receives his B.S. in Chemical Engineering from
the University of Texas in January 1957. "Van" is a member of the
Southwestern Rocket Society, Canterbury Club, and local Vice-
President of A. I. Ch. E. Like all students, he's interested in finding
out about the best opportunities offered in his profession.
Ed Berg answers
I H. Berg received his B.S. Ch. E. from Cornell in 1944
and served as an Engineering Officer on destroyer duty until
1946. Since coming with Du Pont, he has worked at New Jersey
plants as a Field Supervisor in Du Pont's Engineering Service
Division. Ed was recently transferred to Du Pont's Design
Division to further round out his professional development.
We've just completed a study on that subject, Van,
so I can speak with some authority.
Using technical graduates who came with Du Pont
in 1949 as a base, we found these men averaged 1.7
transfers of location in 7 years. We frequently shift
men from one assignment to another at the same loca-
tion, to broaden them professionally. But it's interest-
ing to note that 38% of those surveyed had not
changed their location of employment at all.
Changes of work location depend a little on the
type of work a man enters. For instance, there are
likely to be more transfers in production and sales,
fewer in research.
But one thing is certain. Du Pont transfers are al-
ways purposeful. The majority are a natural result
of Du Pont's continued growth and expansion. And
they invariably represent opportunity for further pro-
fessional development.
Additional employment information is given in
"Chemical Engineers at Du Pont." This booklet
describes in detail the work and responsibilities
of chemical engineers who work at Du Pont.

Going into the Air Force? You may
find yourself piloting atomic powered
planes before you're out, if development
goes on as it has recently. Announcements
trickling over the high security wall in-
dicate that flight tests will begin in the
near future, with some informed viewers
suggesting as early a date as 1958-59.
And although the problems to be solved
are perhaps the largest that aircraft de-
signers have ever had to face, there is
reason to believe that within twenty years
nuclear reactor-driven aircraft will be de-
veloped enough to pass into the commer-
cial transport field.
The Air Force has interested itself in
atomic engines since shortly after World
War II, but only within the past few-
years has their development received any
real impetus. The most spectacular news
came about a year ago, when it was an-
nounced that Gonvair had flown a nuclear
reactor in the nose of a remodeled B-36.
The purpose was to test the efficiency of
shielding only, but the flight was a good
indication of what may soon be expected.
Furthermore, the B-36 is a plane designed
almost ten years ago. Carriers now on the
drawing board—and probably being built
—must far outstrip it in performance.
Both Convair and Lockheed have con-
tracts for the development of suitable air-
frames, and are busy building laboratories
and test facilities in Georgia and Texas.
Lockheed's installations alone will prob-
ably cost about fifty million dollars. Oth-
er contractors for the Air Force are Boe-
ing, Pratt and Whitney, Glenn K. Mar-
tin, Curtiss Wright; and General Electric,
which some time ago completed a proto-
type nuclear reactor for testing at the
Atomic Energy Commission station in
Idaho. The Navy as well has entered ac-
tively into nuclear development, as there
is a strong possibility of sea-based planes,
because of the difficulty of supporting the
craft's enormous weight on conventional
landing gear. (It has been estimated that
reactor and shield alone—mostly the lat-
ter—would weigh over fifty tons.)
Among the Navy's major contractors are
Allison of General Motors, General Elec-
tric Nuclear Development Corporation,
and Curtiss Wright. The Air Force's own
Air Research and Development Command
is to build a seven and one-half million
dollar reactor at Dayton, Ohio.
Last January, the A.E.C. stated in its
semi-annual report to Congress that the
joint A.E.C.—Department of Defense
program for atomic propulsion of military
aircraft "is thought likely to require be-
tween one-half and one and one-half bil-
lion dollars to accomplish, and has as its
objective a military airplane in which ec-
onomics are not a primary consideration."
What advantage has this form of power,
that it should be the subject of such costly
development? The one feature of prime
importance, as in the atomic submarine,
is the ability to operate without refueling
for an indefinite length of time—the rea-
son of course being that the reactor con-
sumes so little weight in fuel compared
to its output in energy. In a typical en-
gine, one-half pound of uranium would
be consumed during a mission of 14,000
miles at 800 miles an hour. The only ap-
parent limitation on the length of flying
time is the endurance of the crew. There
are possibilities for use as an aerial tank-
er, or even a flying aircraft carrier—a sort
of defensive island in the sky.
In contrast to these potentialities are
opposed a good many difficulties and
drawbacks in construction and operation
G.E.'s reactor is apparently designed to

supply heat directly to jet engines. This
means considerable improvement must be
made in present heat exchangers, includ-
ing higher heat transfer rates, smaller
size, and extremely high reliability. On
the other hand, the method eliminates the
necessity for steam circuits and electric
generating equipment of the type used
for land-based planes.
In a type tested last year at Oak Ridge,
air passing through the intake is com-
pressed and then sent through a heat ex-
changer, where it is heated to over
1200°F. Liquid metal circulates from the
heat exchanger to the reactor. A com-
pressor turbine in the exhaust operates
the air compressor and electric generator.
The two jet engines total 40,000 pounds
thrust, and could drive the plane at
800 mph at 60,000 feet. This is equival-
ent to 475,000 horsepower, enough to
supply electric power for a city of 100,000
people.
Further problems include finding some
substance capable of withstanding the
temperatures of an atomic engine and the
corrosive effects of radiation. The best
method of shielding the crewmen is of
prime consideration, and determines some-
what the shaping of the plane. Russian
ideas on the subje-ct seem to favor a long
fuselage with the wings at the rear and
the control surfaces separate, near the
front. American views tend toward a del-
ta-wing shape with the crew compart-
ments projecting well forward.
Guided missiles and other unmanned
craft will present less of a problem, but
the shields used must be adequate to pro-
tect avionic equipment and sensitive con-
trols, which would be completely upset by
radiation's ionizing effect.
Once the plane is operational, it will
require fantastically long, tough runways
to accomodate its weight and speed. These
runways must be distant from centers of
population, in case of accident; and they
must be in duplicate, in case one becomes
contaminated by radiation. Traffic must
be routed over sparsely inhabited areas. A
matter of grave concern is the danger to
ground personnel downwind from an ac-
cident involving any nuclear plane.
Ground operations themselves would be-
come complex and relatively expensive,
including remote "hot" shops for main-
tenance and fuel handling, a disposal sys-
tem for contaminated materials, shielded
vehicles and other special equipment.
How much effect would radiation have
on the crew of the plane? Scientists give
35 roentgens as the maximum amount of
radiation a man can safely absorb in a
lifetime. With currently known shielding
methods, the pilots would receive about
ten roentgens in one flight of 14,000
miles at 800 mph, or nearly one-third of
his lifetime limit. Training flights would
be conducted at the lowest possible speed,
whereby radiation would be considerably
lessened; and ten roentgens would be
saved for one big push.
With all these obstacles to overcome,
how far are we from commercial atomic
transportation? Fifteen years at the least,
say the experts. Not until the second or
third generation of nuclear aircraft will
the kinks be sufficiently ironed out to
make commercial application practical.
Not only that, but operating costs will be
almost prohibitive, particularly when
compared to the revenue from the neces-
sarily small passenger payload. In spite
of the objections, though, atomic: trans-
ports are said to be within the forseeable
future.
The National Advisory Committee for
Aeronautics stated in its report for 1955
that the two most important problems
facing aviation were the perfection of the
Intercontinental Ballistics Missile and the
application of nuclear power to aircraft.
In the year since then, great progress has
been made, and we can be sure that 1957
will bring eventful growth in the aero-
nautical aspect of the Atomic Age.

B-52 jack screw—a typical Boeing design challenge
On Boeing B-52 bombers, the hori-
zontal tail surface has more area than the
wing of a standard twin-engine airliner.
Yet it can be moved in flight, up or down,
to trim the aircraft.
The device that performs this function
is a jack screw, which, though it weighs
only 255 pounds, can exert a force of
approximately 225 tonsl
Many kinds of engineering skills went
into designing and developing a jack
screw so precise that it automatically com-
pensates for stretch and compression
under load. Civil, electrical, mechanical
and aeronautical engineers, and mathe-
maticians and physicists — all find chal-
lenging work on Boeing design projects
for the B-52 global jet bomber, and for
the 707 jet tanker-transport, the BO-
MARC IM-99 pilotless interceptor, and
aircraft of the future.
Because of Boeing's steady expansion,
there is continuing need for additional
engineers. There are more than twice as
many engineers with the company now
as at the peak of World War II. Because
Boeing is an "engineers' company," and
promotes from within, these men find
unusual opportunities for advancement.
Design engineers at Boeing work with
other topnotch engineers in close-knit
project teams. They obtain broad experi-
ence with outstanding men in many
fields, and have full scope for creative
expression, professional growth and indi-
vidual recognition. And they find satis-
faction in the high engineering integrity
that is a Boeing byword.
In addition to design engineering,
there are openings on other Boeing teams
in research and production. Engineers
like the life in the "just-right" size com-
munities of Seattle and Wichita. They
may pursue advanced studies with com-
pany assistance in tuition and participate
in a most liberal retirement plan. There
may be a place for you at Boeing-Seattle
or Boeing-Wichita.

Dear Mr. Levin:
I like your magazine. I greatly enjoyed
"Engineering Psychology" in the Novem-
ber issue. However, I bought that issue
to read the article on gas turbines as I'm
interested in new types of internal com-
bustion engines. After I read the article
I felt I had to tell you what I thought of
it. I was thoroughly disappointed. I found
it very hard to understand. I had to re-
read some parts five times to get even a
vague idea of their meaning. A few sim-
ple diagrams would have helped im-
mensely. I noticed that one diagram was
mentioned, but it was an incorrect page
reference and much too late in the article.
I have yet to find the diagram on any
page. Another drawback that I was very
surprised to find was the confused sen-
tences. To illustrate: On page 44 the last
sentence in the middle column reads:
"However, the axial-flow turbine has de-
veloped to the place where it is efficient
and of any economical use." If this means
turbines can kc- economically used for
anything, it is wrong. The last para-
graph on page 32 says: "The annulus de-
signed chamber is a barrel type design
. . . "It is an annulus barrel chamber, beer
barrel, musket barrel? I don't know.
These are only some of the examples.
Also, I enjoyed the pictures accompany-
ing the article, but what are they? The
article made no mention of a 'Goblin'
rotor (Pg. 40) for example. Does it
drive witches brooms on Halloween?
It has occurred to me that poor proof-
reading is one reason for the quality of
the article, since Karl Johnson knows
what he's saying, unless he poorly para-
phrased plagiarized ideas. However, it
wasn't all poor proofreading since my 15
year old brother could have spotted most
of the errors.
One would think that an engineering
magazine would exemplify engineering
writing, which is supposed to be clear,
precise, and accurate. However, "Gas
Turbine Engines" is a poor example.
I like to look at the Technic for good
writing that I can strive to match myselt.
And this is usually the case, but I was so
amazed by Mr. Johnson's article that I
had to express myself. Also, how about
some understandable material on the free-
piston engines?
Yours truly,
Tom Rathay, '60E
Editor: The error on page 34 was typo-
graphical, and should read "an economical
use." The same is true on page 32; it
should read "annular designed chamber.'
Annular means ring shaped. Hate to dis-
appoint you, but no turbine powered
witches' brooms have been turned out yet.
The rotor was well described in the ar-
ticle. "Goblin" is merely a nickname
given to one type. I do agree, though,
that more data might have been given in
the caption as to its specific features. Your
comment on lack of diagrams was very
appropriate, and I have passed it on to
our Articles Editor. I also passed on the
mention of your interest in free-piston
engines, see page 50.

Kirby Schlegel, Supervising Engineer, Refinery Division
STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING
One of a series of interviews in which
Bechtel Corporation executives discuss
career opportunities for college men.
Question: Mr. Schlegel, your group
is a service group, isn't it? In other
words, you do structural work on all
jobs handled by the Refinery Divi-
sion?
Schlegel: That's right.Our group is
composed of about half graduate
engineers and half non-technical
draftsmen.
Question: What the young struc-
tural engineer considering a job likes
to know first of all is how he would
start out—what his duties would in-
clude.
Schlegel: Well, drawings are what
might be called the "end product" of
our department. New graduate engi-
neers are almost invariably put on
the drawing board.
They must learn to put their ideas on
paper, and the only way they can
learn is by doing such work.
Question: This is really the begin-
ning of design work?
Schlegel: Yes. It is the way the man
begins learning how to become a
practicing engineer—something no
college can teach him.
Question: You said you employ a
number of non-technical draftsmen.
Schlegel: That's right. There is a
great amount of routine and detail
they can handle, thereby freeing the
engineer for creative design effort.
Question: How long a period will
the new engineer spend making
drawings?
ScHlEGEL: Ordinarily about a year—
sometimes more, sometimes less, de-
pending on his aptitude and how he
applies himself.
Question: When he does advance,
what will he be doing?
Schlegel: He moves on to simple
design work, then progresses to heav-
ier design assignments. Group super-
vision follows.
Question: Do job applicants some-
times hesitate about starting on the
drawing board?
Schlegel: Not very often. Most of
them realize that a degree and theory
are just tools. They must learn how
to use these tools in practical engi-
neering work. In other words, the
only way a man can translate his
knowledge into something practical
is on the drawing board where he
can exercise his creativity and bring
his ideas into being.

How to make the most
of your engineering career
n rise to the top
In many companies, an engineer rises, but
soon encounters a low ceiling. Promotions
tend to go to non-engineering executives.
And engineers (surveys show) find it
difficult to make their ideas understood—
or appreciated.
So select a company in which you'll be
working with, and for, engineers—where
an engineer is given an opportunity to
advance when positions ahead open up.
Another point: choose a company that's
growing, preferably in an industry that's
growing and expanding too.
Boeing, you'll discover, fills the bill on all
counts. Engineers at Boeing hold jobs
right to the top. They talk your language.
They appreciate the vital contributions
engineers make. And they reward engineers.
Boeing is growing fast, and today employs
400% more engineers than 10 years ago.
Besides, Boeing operates in the dynamic,
fast-growing field of aviation.
At Boeing you'll enjoy assignments that
lead to an excitement-filled future. A future
with a future: in supersonic flight, jet-
powered civil and military aircraft, gas
turbine engines, guided missiles. At Boeing,
engineers and scientists of all types, and
advanced mathematicians, are probing the
very frontiers of knowledge. They invite
you to join them. You'll find high salaries,
career stability, retirement programs, and
company-financed opportunities for
graduate study. And you'll live in wide-
awake, young-spirited communities.

AN AMERICAN IN
SWEDEN
The story of an unusual summer job; seven
weeks in a Swedish steel mill.
The Hagfors Steel Works
nestled in the hills and
woods of central Sweden.

Golden beams sparkled on the wings
as the sun rose over the Atlantic. Thous-
ands of colored lights reflected in the
lake in the middle of the Tivoli in Copen-
hagen. Living in a little steel mill town
in the middle of Sweden with students
from half a dozen European and Scandi-
navian countries. Working side by side
with Swedish steelworkers. Going out
with pretty, blonde Swedish girls. This
all came about when my curiosity was
aroused by a small notice in the D.O.B.,
"Applications available for junior engi-
neers to work in Europe this summer."
So I dropped in to Professor Young's of-
fice, read the information on it, and took
an application. After some consultation
with my parents regarding the financial
aspects of the trip, I decided to try it.
Sweden was my first choice because of its
high living standards and advanced tech-
nology. Late in March I received an an-
swer from Uddeholm Aktiebolag, offer-
ing me a job at their Hagfors plant which
employs some 1700 men and turns out
specialty steels. The pay would be about
500 kroner a month ($100) and the job
description was "working in the plant's
working departments." Not knowing
what this meant and not being able to
find Hagfors on the map, I accepted. The
form said they would arrange for room
and board for 200 kroner a month
($40). The International Association for
the Exchange of Students for Technical
Experience, the organization sponsoring
this program, was chartering a plane for
the sixty-odd students who were going
over. The fare was $350 New York to
Amsteerdam and back. IAESTE had also
arranged a 50 per cent reduction on my
railroad ticket from the border (Malmo)
to Hagfors and back. So all I had to do
was get a passport, pack less than 44
pounds of clothes to last three months,
and get to New York on June 10, two
days before my last final exam. While-
getting ready I wrote to Uddeholm A. B.
for specific information on my housing
and job, the weather and character of
Hagfors. Their answer read, "Bring along
steel shoes and workpants. The last few
summers have been very warm and dry,
80 to 90°F. in the day, but cool at night.
You will live in a company house with
students from Sweden, Germany, Austria,
Denmark, Finland and Burma, and eat
in the Works Hotel. Hagfors is a small,
young town."
Finally it was the morning of June 10
and I was boarding a KLM plane at Idle-
wild Airport. The trip over was fabulous.
KLM really did a terrific job feeding us
and quenching our thirst. The ride was
smooth and the steady pounding of the
engines was soon forgotten. We had
breakfast the next morning in Prestwick,
Scotland. The waiters wore tails; how-
ever, the English food still tasted
miserable. An hour later we were on our
way and landed in Amsterdam's Schipol
airport about 2:00 p.m. I received the
most thorough customs inspection of my
whole trip there, as I had to open both
bags and they probed each. The only
other place I had to even open my bags

was on entering Germany where the in-
spector just glanced at the contents. We
were taken by bus to the KLM office
where we went our various ways.
After changing some money I took
a tram (fare 4 cents) to the railroad sta-
tion, bought a ticket, checked my bags
and went for a walk, since I had five
hours before the train left for Copenha-
gen. Took a boat tour. The guide had to
explain everything in four languages
and thus really didn't say much. How-
ever, it was still interesting and would
have been even without a guide. Am-
sterdam is "old world-ish" with an intri-
cate canal system (billed as Venice of the
north) and small streets full of thous-
ands of cyclists. Young, old, going to
work, or to a fancy night club, most
people use bicycles. Perhaps- Ann Arbor
should send someone to Holland to get
some tips on how to handle thousands of
bicyclists. On the train north I talked to
a ship construction superintendent from
Rotterdam. He talked at length on the
almost complete destruction of Rotter-
dam by the Germans, the miraculous job
of reconstruction which has turned Rot-
terdam into a thriving modern metropo-
lis once again. He also complained that
Rotterdam, once the liveliest port in
Europe (and that is pretty lively), was
now practically dead at nighttime. Dur-
ing the night we crossed two borders. I
had stretched out in our comfortable
second-class compartment and was doz-
ing when we came to the first. All of a
sudden the door was opened and the
Dutch customs inspector came in. I got
up and he glanced at my passport and
luggage and walked out, so I went back
to sleep. Five minutes later the door
opened again admitting a Dutch police
inspector who looked at my passport, ask-
ed a few questions, gave me the once-
over and left. I went back to sleep only
to be awakened ten minutes later by a
German police inspector. Out came the
passport again, more questions, and he
left. \)^ise by now, I awaited the German
customs man. He looked at my passport,
made me open my large case, glanced at
it and asked where I was going, for
what, how often I crossed the border,
and whether I had any tea, coffee, or cig-
arettes. The fact that I had an American
passport seemed to make things easier, as
he asked many more questions of and in-
vestigated more thoroughly the bags ot
the Danish ship worker who shared the
compartment with me. After he left, I
figured I could go safely back to sleep
and did so only to be awakened again
by the German conductor. This rigama-
role took place at every one of the twenty
borders I crossed.
Arrived in Copenhagen late the next
morning. Through the services of the
Danish Tourist Bureau I settled in a
small, clean and inexpensive centrally lo-
cated hotel. I was stopped as I left the
station by a plainclothesman who thought
I was an Italian criminal. I made him
show me his identification first and ex-
amined it closely before I showed him

ing their passports to "police." He turned
out to be legit and so did I .
Spent that evening at the Tivoli
(amusement park) amazed. Within its
-walls were restaurants, outdoor cafes, a
music hall with nightly concerts, an out-
door stage with tumbling, acrobatics, and
other circus acts, an outdoor theatre pre-
senting French pantomime, dancing halls,
games, rides and gambling. I was amazed
at the amount of the gambling that went
on. There were hundreds of roulette
tables, card tables and other games of
chance, but each one was crowded with
people and the surprising thing is that
the crowd consisted mostly of middle-
aged women. Danes are certainly free
living people and all ages have their fun.
Spent two more days in Copenhagen see-
ing the sights, toured Georg Jensen fac-
tory which is world-famous for their
hand-made silver products. Noticed that
suburbs are nice and modern, and roads
were up to date and uncrowded. Caught
train for Stockholm where I spent two
days. It's very modern and clean, the
people are very friendly and many speak
English. But Stockholm just doesn't have
the color, the joy of life, the atmosphere
and flavor that Copenhagen does. The
first night I took in a Swedish version
of Midsummer Night's Dream. Didn't
understand a word but it was interesting,
especially the colorful scenery. The next
night on being informed by the maitre de
that there would be a fifteen-minute wait
for dinner, I went for a short walk. I saw
a line of a hundred people of my own
age, both male and female and all seem-
ingly "stag," so I got in and inquired of
two gentlemen in front of me, "What's
up?" They knew enough English to tell
me "Dancing . . . Lots of pretty girls," so
I stayed in line. It turned out to be a beau-
tiful circular dancing hall where respec-
table girls can be met. You were shown to
your table as in a restaurant and paid
$1.50 for entrance, an order of little cakes
and all the coffee you wanted. Before each
dance set you just went up to a girl and
sort of nodded. She would accept and
you were dancing. Swedish girls are nice.
The next morning I took an early train
to Hagfors. The closer I got to Hagfors
the less English people spoke, which was
not encouraging. Hagfors is about half-
way between Stockholm and Oslo. I was
met at the train station by Mr. Gedin,
an engineer and very nice chap who has
charge of all the students working at
Uddeholm. He spoke English very well,
as did most of the college-educated
people I met.
He took me to the long frame house,
next to a rapids of the Ulan river, which
was to be my home for the next eight
weeks and showed me my room. Beyond
my expectations, it was not plush by any
means, but clean, modern and completely
adequate even if the mattress was made
of straw. The house itself had a long
central passageway on each side of which
were three rooms. At the end there was
a fully equipped kitchen and washroom
facilities.
One of the fellows came in and intro-
duced himself as Olaf. He was obviously
Swedish, tall, slim and very quiet. He
showed me the way to the Brukshotellet
(Works Hotel) where I ate all of my
meals. It was a small brick building with
a big dining room and a lounge on the
first floor. The dining room consisted of
one big table in the middle where the
food was served buffet style. One took a
plate, served himself, and went to his
table along the side of the room. There
was little choice in food, but it was
usually very good and one could have as
much as he wanted. Swedish taste and
cooking is very similar to American. Dif-
ferences did exist, though. Their diet
had a much greater proportion of fish. I
can remember once when they served
spaghetti and boiled potatoes and another
time when the main dish was cauliflower.
I ate out that day. They have a sweet thin
soup which they serve very often for
dessert, but I like my jello solidified.
Their midday meal was usually the larg-
est. For beverages milk was fresh, good
and plentiful. One could get soft drinks
and beer from a refrigerator in the
kitchen. Swedish beer is cheap, ten cents
a bottle, but it tastes it. It couldn't com-
pare with the fine Danish beer which I
think is the best beer in Europe. Swedish
coffee was also on the table; it was much
better than American coffee.
The manager of the Works Hotel, a
middle-aged Swedish woman, spoke ex-
cellent American besides five or six other
languages. She was very pleasant and effi-
cient and saw to it that we were well
taken care of. Besides the student work-
ers, several of the townspeople and a
few transients ate there. The lounge next
to the dining room had a radio, piano,
many magazines and papers, and playing
cards. Several of the Swedish papers have
a one-column summary of the news in
English.
On Sunday night we went to the Folks-
parken (the people's park) which consist-

Being the "stick my finger in the pie too" type he is Shelly
Levin, '57 I.E., couldn't resist the temptation of a summer spent
abroad. So he ended up spending seven weeks last summer work-
ing in a Swedish steel mill under a technical exchange program.
Taking account of the facts that it was to appear in the "High
School Issue," his folks might read it, and that female friends on
campus might come across it, Shelly explained that, "the article
is limited and according to standards set by current stories about
Sweden, might seem lacking." But he went on to assure us "for
the most part the article is complete and things aren't what they're
cracked up to be.
Fairly active in school affairs, Shelly a graduate of Von
Steuben High in Chicago has been Technic editor-in-chief, Arch
editor, Engine Council vice-president, president of senior engi-
neering class, and a member of Tau Beta Pi, Vulcans and Tri-
angles.

REFLECTIONS
OF A
FRESHMAN
College provides a series of experi-
ences which transforms raw freshmen into
educated finished products. Impressions
are made on freshmen which change
their attitudes. Freshmen are constantly
reminded of the differences between life
in a university community and life as they
knew it before they entered the Uni-
versity. Any gathering of freshmen engi-
neers which has nothing better to do
ponders this subject. Most of them agree
that their adjustment to colleges would
have been easier if they had known what
to expect. This article attempts to sum-
marize the remarks of several unsuspect-
ing freshmen engineers as well as those
of the author. It is hoped that some po-
tential freshmen will profit from our re-
flections.
The large size of the University of
Michigan makes the first impression on
freshmen. The number of people who
are students and the size of the campus
combine to make a freshman feel very
insignificant at first. The crowd of six
thousand or so freshmen which heard
President Hatcher speak during orienta-
tion seemed to me, at the time, to be as
large as the one hundred thousand people
which jammed into the football stadium
a few weeks later. Looking for buildings,
not classrooms is a new experience. How-
ever, the bigness is not bad or impersonal
as many small colleges would have you
believe. By living on campus in residence
halls, freshmen meet large numbers of
people. Every person whom a freshman
knows has roommates, friends, etc. and in
a short time each person knows hundreds
of people. Usually the best friends of a
freshman are in the house of the resi-
dence hall where he lives.
Living in a residence hall is an ex-
perience in itself. All freshmen, except
those from Ann Arbor, live in a resi-
dence hall. In dormitory life, freshmen
learn to get along with the men in their
house and to get along without parential
influence. Residence halls lack the peace,
quiet, and privacy that students are ac-
customed to at home. A typical night for
a student has people coming in and out
of his room, borrowing things, wanting
him to go somewhere with them, chal-
lenging him to cards or chess, and need-
ing help on homework. The student can
not stop them; he must retaliate by do-
ing the same to his friends. Often in the
middle of an English theme, the whole
corridor will assemble to remind him
that it is his turn to go to "Krazie's" for
hamburgers. Many a freshman has re-
turned to his unlocked room to find his
bed unassembled, knobs taken off his
desk, enough waste paper on the floor for
a Salvation Army paper drive, and the
air saturated with fly-spray. It is diffi-
cult to determine whether such humorous
outrages are caused by friends or enemies;
both are often responsible. Living in a
residence hall is not like home, but
it is an interesting and unusual experi-
ence.
Orientation Week, held before the reg-
ular classes begin, is an organized effort
to adopt freshmen to the University.
Freshmen are rushed through meetings,
speeches, tests, mixers and coke dates,
and taken to most of the buildings on
campus. Notoriously bad ID pictures
are taken and freshmen are given huge
sheets of forms to fill out. Called "bus
tickets" and "train tickets," which they
resemble, they are filled out to be stamp-
ed, torn, and punched during registra-
tion. Amazingly enough, after the rush
and bustle of orientation, freshmen no
longer become lost on the main campus.
All of the paper work of registration is
done. Freshmen are prepared for classifi-
cation which comes at the end of orienta-
tion and the initial shock of classes.
Schedules are made out at classifica-
tion. Freshmen are perplexed by closed
sections which force the almost inevitable
Saturday classes. Those who had hoped
to go home on some Friday evenings re-
sign themselves to Saturday classes
while those who live one thousand or
more miles distant receive none. The final
schedules are usually similar to checker
boards, having alternate classes and blank
spots. However bad a freshman's schedule
may be, there are always upperclassmen
around who insist that their freshmen
schedule was much worse.
The atmosphere of a class at the Uni-
versity is far different than that of a

articles as "Heat Barrier" and "The New Aerotrain" was active
in high school also. Carl graduated from Flint Mandeville High
School, where he participated in Student Council and Debate,
and was Class President. Thus he was a logical choice to write
"Reflections of a Freshman."
high school. Students are called Mr. or
Miss by the instructor. The instructor is
called Professor, Dr., or Mr., depending
on his degree and departmental standing.
Freshmen learn to call an instructor
whose standing they do not know "Sir"
until they can find it out.
The amount of work connected with
classes comes as a shock to most fresh-
men. Used to skimming through in high
school, the idea of having to spend most
of the time on homework is a surprise.
Only twenty or twenty-two hours per
week is spent in class but homework
takes about twice as long. A person could
spend every available second of time
studying and flunk out if he failed his
tests. Engineering freshmen work harder
than those in the College of Literature,
Science and Arts, but college aptitude tests
show they have a higher degree of in-
telligence.
Apart from environmental changes,
the greatest change a freshman becomes
aware of is the shifting of responsibility.
High schools have the responsibility of
exposing a certain age group of the
community to education, regardless of
their ability or desire. Attendance is
compulsory until a certain age is reached,
homework is collected, and the teachers
spend much of their time maintaining
order in the class. In colleges, however,
homework is seldom collected, roll is
usually not taken, and no one cares if the
student is being exposed. Students are
expected to act like adults. Most of the
immature people who are problems in
high schools do not make it to college;
there is little discipline problem for the
instructor. Responsibility for getting the
education is placed with the student.
In the College of Engineering, the re-
sponsibility of the student is encouraged
through the Honor Code. No instructors
are present during exams, but each stu-
dent is required to sign a pledge, "I have
neither given nor received aid on this
examination," or credit is not given. The
honesty displayed by the students in fol-
lowing the code makes a strong impres-
sion on freshmen.
The social aspects of college are im-
portant, though they are often exagger-
ated. Dances, plays, movies, concerts, etc.
are going on continually. Engineering
freshmen meet women (other than the
best looking one percent of Engine
School through mixers, coke dates, and
various informal means. Some freshmen
enter Engineering and try to lead an un-
limited social life simultaneously. After
five week grades are issued, they realize
that homework can be a stricter restraint
than parental regulation.
Freshmen notice that the social cus-
toms at Michigan are different from those
of high schools. In some ways they are
more flexible. Many customs grow from
University rules such as the driving ban.
Individual students of many different
backgrounds leave their local customs
and formalities when they enter the Uni-
versity. Also, the large number of stu-
dents makes it possible for an individual
to be active socially without being a topic
for gossip as is the case in smaller schools.
Extra-curricular activities at Michigan
do not seem to be as well supported as
those in high school. This is mainly due
to the increase of homework and partially
due to a generally increased social life.
Many feel they can not spare the time for
extra-curricular activities. Yet those who
do find time for clubs, debates, intramural
sports, publications, etc., believe they are
of great value. They provide enjoyment,
benefits, and friends. There is more op-
portunity for freshmen or any student
in extracurricular activities than anyone
could take advantage of completely.
As I walked under the Engineering
Arch on my way to class the other day, I
attempted to estimate the number of
times I would pass under it before leaving
the University. The number arrived at
was 14,000, quite small when considering
how distant graduation seems. I eval-
uated my first semester here at Michigan
and decided that my time could not be
spent at a better place. Speaking for most
engineering freshmen, I would advise
anyone seeking an education to come to
Michigan. It is a decision I don't think
I will ever regret.

ENGINEERS EDUCATION
by PROFESSOR ROBERT CADDELL
In an age when airplanes fly faster than
the speed of sound, electronic computers
solve complex mathematical problems
with fantastic ease, and automobile en-
gines are produced on huge transfer ma-
chines, seemingly "untouched by human
hands," the graduating engineer may well
wonder just where he will find his niche
in the industrial world. Do I have suffi-
cient background? How much of my
training will I actually apply? Am I ex-
pected to remember the endless number
of theories, formulas, and facts present-
ed during my college education? How
can I be certain that the job selected will
fit my interests and special talents? Ques-
tions such as these are often asked by
students nearing graduation and prepar-
ing to embark on industrial careers, but
the concerns expressed have not been
born in the jet age. They are not a special
result caused by technical progress in the
past decade, nor are they restricted in ap-
plication to any specific graduating class.
Similar questions have persisted for years
and will continue to pervade the thoughts
of students in all fields of engineering
studies.
There are no stock answers which sat-
isfy these questions. Since no one can
foresee the exact demands of every future
job, a generalized discussion of these
queries must be made. Perhaps a satisfac-
tory approach would be to review the
special type of training an engineering
student undergoes, to analyze the im-
portance of and reasons for such training,
and then to discuss the overall philosophy
of what a college education should do for
the individual.
Regardless of the field of special study
to be pursued, there appears to be uni-
versal agreement that schooling in par-
ticular topics, or fundamentals, is a basic
necessity for all would-be engineers.
Mathematics, physics, chemistry, and Eng-
lish constitute the base upon which future
studies are built. These are the tools used
to analyze and solve problems of a tech-
nical nature, and they offer the means
for expressing a solution in terms of a
common language, be it verbal or arith-
metic. It should be realized by the stu-
dent that he must become proficient in
these basic topics before advanced studies
are undertaken.
Once the field of special interest is
selected, the introduction to advanced
course work begins. It is in courses of
this kind that the fundamental concepts
mentioned previously are applied to prob-
lems of a specific nature. The reasons for
analyzing and solving these problems may
serve to distinguish the engineer from the
physicist or mathematician.
Advanced courses have several pur-
poses. Since they demand application of
the basic topics, it is here the student
may first realize that earlier studies are
not hurdles to be met, passed, and then
forgotten. Constant use of these funda-
mental courses is required; they are an
integral part of future class work rather
than a beginning and end unto them-
selves. A second purpose for undertaking
advanced work concerns the type of
thought or reasoning an engineer should
use when confronted with problems that
are new in scope or content. Much has
been written about the "engineering ap-
proach" in regard to practical problems.
Only by presenting to him situations that
demand such an approach can the stu-
dent be introduced to this method of
logical anasysis. A third and most obvious
purpose of advanced study is to furnish
a primary background which the student
may utilize in his future job. Whether
it be electronics, metallurgy, design or
any of the other numerous areas of engi-
neering study, initial contact with these
subjects commences at this stage of
training.
To this point an attempt has been
made to discuss the technical training
presented in most engineering colleges.
Just how much of this information is
used? The extent to which individual
topics are applied, after graduation, varies

students pose. Concern regarding just what they are ex-
pected to retain from their college training is often ex-
pressed. This article is an attempt to explain what they
should get out of a college education and how they might
put this background to use.
greatly with individual experiences. In
the industrial world today, the different
fields of engineering have become so
broad that a scope of training in a par-
ticular area is more valuable than an ex-
cessive amount of concentration on one
subject. For example, in the field of me-
chanical engineering a professional career
in heat power, design, manufacturing, air
conditioning, fluids, or automotive engi-
neering is possible. Even in one of these
specific areas there are various directions
that may be followed; in fact, many of
these special fields overlap. It seems
most advisable, therefore, to include a
wide scope of study in undergraduate
training. This affords a greater range of
possibilities for professional careers and
develops an awareness of fields that are
interdependent with the one pursued by
the graduate engineer. The background
received in college is a composite of many
subjects. Although particular topics may
never seem to find any obvious applica-
tion, they are an intangible part of this
background and do contribute to its de-
velopment. For this reason alone they are
a direct benefit.
Most definitions of engineering include
the words "art and science" and it is im-
portant that the differences between these
words be understood. During the period
of formal education the student does not
usually possess the ability to formulate
correct judgments without first making a
thorough analysis with the scientific tools
at his disposal. This ability may be classed
as an art and is obtained only from actual
practice and experience, thus, there is
little, if any art included at this stage of
development. The method used to deter-
mine solutions to problems is purely
scientific in nature and often involves ard-
uous calculations which furnish the neces-
sary proof. As practical experience is ac-
cumulated it provides a source of refer-
ence that will often permit proper deci-
sions to be made without resorting to la-
borious calculations. At this stage art and
science have reached an harmonious level
of application. The engineer falls some-
where between the pure scientist and
the pure artist. He is primarily a prac-
titioner concerned with getting cor-
rect results as rapidly and economically
as possible. To attain these ends, the
art developed from previous experience
is often employed, but the scientific
knowledge he possesses always serves as
the backbone for proving his judgments
are sound. Drifting to and remaining at
either extreme, be it art or science, does
not constitute an engineer in the true
meaning of the word.
Much concern is evinced in regard to
the multitude of standard formulas that
become an integral part of an engineering
education. Certainly it is a prohibitive if
not an impossible task to memorize the
numerous equations involved and, it seems
ludicrous to assume that each equation
must be derived every time it is used.
There is little question, however, that
the process of derivation is a valid and
beneficial step to be taken before these
equations can be applied intelligently.
Many empirical expressions are based
upon certain assumptions which may im-
pose limitations on their application. Un-
less such factors are presented during the
period of derivation, improper conclu-
sions could result from their usage. Mere
application of a mathematical relationship
does not constitute a real understanding
of its meaning; determining why such an
expression takes a certain form does lead
to this end.
Illustrations may clarify the above
statements. By means of integral calculus,
a mathematical proof shows that the area
of any circle is nR2- Future usage of this
relationship does not necessitate continued
derivations. Calculus serves as the tool
which produces this symbolized expres-
sion, and a knowledge of this phase of
mathematics permits the individual to de-
termine the end result. It is not a case of
accepting an equation as being undeniably
true; here it is proved conclusively. Next,

dell received his B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at Newark
College of Engineering in 1948. Three years later, he received his
masters in Industrial from the University of Michigan, and
decided to stay on to teach. Prof. Caddell's pastimes include
golf, swimming, photography, and non-technical reading, and
he is a member of Tau Beta Pi and ASME.
consider the case of a cantilever beam. To
determine the deflection of this type of
beam, the expression PL:!/3EI is used.
The important point is not to memorize
this equation, but rather to recognize
that the kind of beam involved is a can-
tilever rather than a fixed beam. Texts
and handbooks supply sources of infor-
mation. These reference books will pro-
vide most standard relationships and
their availability makes excessive mem-
orization unnecessary. But this should
not imply that engineering is a simple
process of checking handbooks and in-
serting numbers into selected equations.
The ability to analyze a problem at the
outset, determine how the problem may
be handled, and finally, to make use of
the correct expressions that fit this par-
ticular problem are the ingredients that
distinguish the engineering approach
from one of pure trial and error. How to
calculate an answer is important but de-
fining the issue initially is the primary
consideration that the engineer must face.
Now it would be appropriate to dis-
cuss the philosophy of an engineering
education beyond the merits of the tech-
nical training it affords. In the not too
distant past, little emphasis was placed
on the type of course-work classed as
"non-technical." As society became more
dependent upon the end products that
were directly influenced by engineering
talent and ingenuity, regard for this talent
became widely manifest. Administrative
positions were often filled with these
technically trained people. They became
leaders of men and many of their con-
cerns were directed toward economical
aspects of industry. Much of their techni-
cal ability was no longer employed to the
fullest degree since their problems were
often in different spheres of endeavor.
Without previous training in such areas
as economics, psychology, and business
concepts, they were at a definite disad-
vantage. To write concise and clear re-
ports required more ability than had been
presupposed. For these and other rea-
sons it became obvious that an engineering
curriculum must include a fair dose of
th; type of courses previously restricted
to the field of liberal arts.
But the inclusion of such coursework
in engineering training goes beyond the
benefits just listed. There must be more
to a college education, and this includes
any field of study, than the grasping of a
bit of esoteric knowledge. Reference
to the "well rounded man" has been
made so often that such cliches be-
come almost meaningless. But there is
such an individual, he can arise from
any background, and he is an extremely
valuable person. He is not the mere
product that results from four years of
college benefits, whether exposed to
Chaucer and Shakespeare or to thermo-
dynamics and calculus. But the exposure
to a higher education should provide a
definite impetus toward this goal. He will
result, however, only because of indi-
viduaJ efforts and interests and these must
be seJf generated. His qualifications in-
clude an honest interest and liking for
the profession he follows for over fifty
percent of a lifetime. Beyond the sphere
of daily wage earning there should be an
intelligent interest in the affairs of his
government and the rest of the world.
Participation in activities outside his pro-
fessional work, be they mental or physical,
is an essential requisite. The capacity for
adapting to situations and individuals,
both within and outside his own pro-
fession, is a necessary ingredient. Ob-
viously, no single set of standards would
satisfy all concepts of this nebulous per-
son, but to contribute to the reality ot
such individuals is one of the aims ot
"higher" education. His presence affords
benefit to those around him and the es-
sence of his makeup gives him a greater
capacity for his job in particular and tor
life in general. He is as important as he
wants to be, to himself and society.
In conclusion, it should be clear that
numerous challenges and opportunities
await the graduating engineer. The tools
needed to get results are at his disposal
but are not accompanied by some master
set of instructions which detail their
every use. Proficiency will be achieved
when these tools are applied in actual
practice. The awarding of a degree in
engineering signifies a beginning; an
engineer will emerge after this train-
ing has been put to use. Only then will
each individual find the answers he
sought at the outset of his professional
career.

ed of a covered open-air theatre, a small
open dance floor for folk music which
was rarely used, and a much larger cov-
ered open-air dance floor for modern
"American" style music, a restaurant, and
a small amusement gallery. That night
we saw home-town entertainment singing
American songs. One song supposedly in
English I couldn't understand. Then there
was dancing, and I danced a few times.
The procedure was similar to the hall in
Stockholm. Near the entrance the girls
stood huddled together with the men all
around. At the beginning of a set of two
numbers one went up and nodded to a
girl, extending his arm. Usually she
would accept, take his arm, and they
would dance. Most of the girls did not
dance too well, some spoke a little Eng-
lish, and their appearance was similar
to an average group of American girls.
Ove, one of the Swedish prakticants
(student workers), introduced me to
Buse the town sharpie, that night—red
jacket, green vest and Swedish D.A.
Buse turned out to be very friendly.
The next morning I was to see Gedin
at 7:15 a.m.; this allowed me to eat
breakfast at the Brukshotel which start-
ed serving at 6:45. After that first day I
went on regular day shift hours, 7:00-
4:30 Monday through Friday with an
hour for lunch, and 7:00-12:30 Satur-
day, a total of 48 hours. Breakfast then
consisted of sandwiches and milk which I
had picked up the night before at the
Brukshotel.
Gedin filled out many papers, placed
me in the steel plant, got me a gate pass
and showed me around. He introduced me
to the plant superintendent and the fore-
man. The superintendent was an engi-
neer who spoke English and, although
only 32, was already in charge of a 150-
man plant.
I was to start the next morning, so
Gedin helped me buy a pair of work-
pants and took me to the tax collector's
office who released me from paying any
taxes under a law similar to our "under
$600."
At work at seven the next morning, I
found the foreman who didn't speak any
English. He gave me a locker and sent
me over to get steel shoes. Horrible
things, bottom made out of wood, in-
cluding innersole, front top of steel, mid-
dle top of inflexible material, and no
back. For the first few weeks I had huge
red welts on my instep and couldn't walk
more than a hundred feet at a time in
those shoes. Getting the right size was no
easy job, either; Swedish sizes run dif-
ferent from ours and the plant's sizes
were still different. Finally, the three shoe
fitters and I settled on the right pair.
Later when I got my first paycheck I
found they had deducted 7 kroner
($1.40) for the shoes.
I was then brought to a German who
spoke little but understood quite a bit of
English. I can understand a little German,
so we carried on a conversation; he spoke
&lt;n German and I in English. It seemed
that Jje had been a POW in Canada for
three years and had gone back to Ger-
many, but in 1949-51 there was no
work to be had so he came to Sweden.
He did not like it in Hagfors "because
the people are primitive and the steel-
works are dirty." The steel plant was
fifty years old, outdated, and as he said,
very dirty. The company is planning to
build a new one in five years. Hagfors has
7,000 people. The Uddeholm works em-
ploy 1700. Give every man a wife and
two kids and that's the town, just about
all steelworkers. Therefore, there was lit-
tle culture in the town and it tended to be
primitive as my German friend put it.
Later on Ove came over and we wan-
dered about through the various plants
through the rest of the day. The Hagfors
steelworks consists of the following
plants: Pig Iron Plant, with four blast
furnaces; steel plant with a five-ton
Bessemer furnace, three 20-ton open
hearths, two 5-ton electric induction fur-
naces, and a 17-ton electric arc furnace; a
foundry, producing both for sale and in-
ternal use; blooming mill; strip rolling
mill; hammer mill; annealing and hard-
ening plant; and machine shop. The
next morning I was assigned to the elec-
tric arc furnaces and worked about the

first fifteen minutes. Then I met an elec-
trical repairman who spoke some Eng-
lish. He showed me all around the steel
plant and the foundry, explaining opera-
tions and procedures and showing me
how to read the records kept of each
heat of steel. The next day he started
teaching me how to weld.
Ove got me a bicycle to use for a
week. It came in handy, as I did quite a
bit of walking over the dusty and stony
roads. Most of the people use bicycles.
Cars are relatively small in number but
are increasing every year. German Opels
and Volkswagens and Swedish Volvos
are most popular. The Volvo is a small
car resembling a 1946 Ford. A five-year
guarantee covering labor and parts makes
it very popular with the working man.
Another unique feature is the company's
offer to replace with a new car any Volvo
that was damaged beyond repair in an ac-
cident.
June 21 was the Midsummer Holiday.
It is the day when the sun shines for the
longest time and is celebrated as a joy-
ful national holiday in Sweden. All
through the country children dance
around a maypole and sing songs. In the
province of Dalarna the people wear tra-
ditional costumes and perform delightful
dances and songs. People came from all
over Sweden and even the continent to
watch the goings on in Dalarna. In
northern Sweden the sun stays up all
night on June 21 and thus is known as
the "Land of the Midnight Sun." Even in
Hagfors it would begin to get light at
2 A.M.
Usually on Saturday and Sunday nights
there was dancing at the Folksparken or
some other dance hall nearby. Once in a
while there would be a Massan (traveling
carnival) at a nearby town and everybody
would go there on special buses. Most
people went to the dance stag, danced
with many girls, talked with friends and
perhaps escorted a girl home afterwards.
Even the few couples who came together
would usually split up after the first
dance. My real surprise came when I
found that married couples would do the
same! In some cases where there were
children one would go dance one week
while the other baby-sat, and vice versa.
This custom, however, was not very
prevalent among the more educated
people. Most of the Swedish students I
met were in favor of "dates."
After the first few days I was switched
to the shift from 4:00 a.m.-12:00 noon
and work began in earnest. First I helped
out at the 17-ton Herault electric arc fur-
nace, shoveling coal in to form a slag and
knocking out the ingots, both very hot
jobs. This furnace uses 50-cycle alternat-
ing current and is top charged after lift-
ing aside the roof. It is basic lined, the
hearth and walls are built of magnesite
brick and dolomite, which resists the ac-
tion of basic (lime bearing) slag. Basic
slag removes sulphur and phosphorus
from the steel. It is possible by this
means to produce steel with a pure an-
alysis even from simpler, less pure ini-
tial material. Much 18-8 stainless was
produced at this furnace.
Next I worked at the Siemens-Martin
(open-hearth) furnace as a hclpworker
and beater. In other words, I shoveled

Hungriest furnace I ever saw. Also help-
ed poke a hole in the bottom to tap the
furnace. Magnificent sight, 1800° C. steel
pouring out sparking, roaring and splash-
ing while six men scrambled back to get
out of the way. Siemens Martin is a
gas fired furnace with long shallow
hearths. The gas and air combustion are
preheated in checker chambers through
which the exhaust gases pass periodically.
Hagfors has three such furnaces, each
charged with 20 tons. A heat takes about
ten hours and since at least one furnace
is down being repaired, capacity is about
100 tons a day. Like Bessemer converters
they are acid lined, the hearth being
built of quartz. The raw materials used
are pig iron, scrap metal, sponge iron and
granulated iron. Scrap metal consists of
discards from Hagfors' own mills, thus
it is a pure material of known analysis.
The combustion gases have an excess of
air which oxidizes the surplus of silicon,
manganese, and carbon; iron ore is also
added for this purpose. Tapping takes
place from the back of the furnace into
a ladle from which the steel is turned into
ingot molds. Low alloyed high quaity steel
is produced; much razor blade steel is
made here.
In the steel plant there were also two
5-ton high frequency induction furnaces.
I didn't work there but noticed that the
heat time is about two to three hours.
Among other things, high grade stainless
razor blade steel is produced there.
Meanwhile I had bought some clothes
which were comparatively expensive, a
plain heavy cotton Sears Roebuck type
sport shirt running 22 kroner ($4.40).
I took some clothes to the laundry and
after only two weeks they were done.
Found everything sparkling clean. Sparkl-
ing clean, all right, they had taken half
the material off the shirts. Glad I told
them no starch!
After three weeks I was transferred to
the strip mill which occupied a 200-meter
long building. It was comprised of a
semi-automatic roughing stand and an
automatic finishing train. The roughing
mill is a reversible two-high universal
type and is operated by one man. The
scale is removed from the steel by spray-
ing with water at 100 atmosphere pres-
sure. The train consisted of five four-high
stands and one two-high stand in series.
Edging mills are provided after the first
and third stands. The steel starts out a
heated billet perhaps ten feet long and
ends up a strip thirty to forty feet long,
a specified width and thickness being held
to three millimeters. Finally traveling
about 180 feet a minute it is water cool-
ed and coiled on automatic reels. My
job was to bind and identify it. So I
would slip a tag bearing the order num-
ber onto a four foot arc-ed wire, toss one
end through the center of the roll, catch
it, twist the two ends together, grab a
heavy wrench and apply the finishing
touches. At 800° C. it got pretty hot
there. Sometimes the strips would come
through at the rate of two a minute. It
wasn't usually bad, though, because strips
fouled in the rollers often and piled up
like an accordion. This would shut down
the whole line till the tangled metal
could be removed and the machinery ad-
justed. In that first week I think there
was at least 50 per cent down time. Now
whether or not the fact that the mill was
entirely designed by Hagfors' own engi-
neers had anything to do with it I don't
know, but it looked like a lot of produc-
tion time, wages and good material was
going down the drain. One engineer
commented that it was due to the close
tolerances that were held.
Anyway, the down time gave me a
good chance to get to know the other
workmen. As a group they were much
friendlier than the steel plant men. Pos-
sibly due to the fact that the steel plant
employed many foreign men (drifters),
was old and dirty, and the few semi-
skilled townspeople who worked there
were old and gruff. The strip mill, on the
other hand, was clean and modern and
the work force consisted of young friend-
ly townspeople. One man in particular
who had come from Finland but had
married and settled down in Hagfors,
taught me Swedish. He came from a part
of Finland where they speak a finer Swed-
ish than that spoken in Hagfors. Even
though he didn't speak English we could
converse quite a bit using a little German,
a little Swedish and sign language. Swed-
ish is not a hard language to pick up, in-
deed some words are quite similar to their
English counterparts and between the
Finn, a few friendly townspeople and the
Swedish students I lived with, I could
speak a broken Swedish by the end of
seven weeks. Writing and reading would
probably be harder, which will be evident
from the fact that Gothenburg is pro-
nounced Yutaburrie.
Not being able to speak Swedish can
come in handy. One Sunday I was re-
laxing with a magazine when a door to
door salesman knocked, burst in and be-
fore I could get a word in edgewise,

YOUR FUNCTION IN ENGINEERING
by DEAN GEORGE G. BROWN
For many years the Engineering Pro-
fession has been defined in terms of par-
ticular branches—Civil, Mechanical, Elec-
trical, Chemical, etc. These branches or
fields indicate the area of interest of the
practicing engineer and the corresponding
area of activity in which he is prepared
to engage.
Although we can describe what engi-
neers do—the civil engineer designs or
constructs bridges, highways, water sys-
tems, or other structures, the mechanical
engineer designs and builds engines, ma-
chines, tools, and all types of mechanical
devices—we cannot say what engineers
cannot or do not do. In every human
activity, technical or otherwise, some-
where you will find an engineer. Even in
a company so dependent upon engineers
as the General Electric Company we find
that less than 20 per cent of all of their
graduate engineers are engaged in that
branch of engineering which they studied
in school.
The outstanding characteristic of all
professional engineers is the willingness
and ability to find a new and satisfactory
solution to a practical problem usually
based on incomplete data. In this way,
the engineer creates a new process or de-
sign. /; has been said that the scientist
solves the problems that can be solved
while the engineers solve the problems
that must be solved.
This ability was originally developed
by a combination of experience and
judgment based on many observations
over many years, and extended by those
who had the aptitude and the courage to
widen the range of experience by build-
ing larger and different structures or new
and better products than had ever been
attempted before. The great pyramid in
Egypt (3,000 B.C.), King Solomons
temple in Jerusalem (1,000 B.C.), the
Parthenon in Greece (450 B.C.) and the
still standing triple tier stone aqueduct
built by the Roman's (19 B.C.) near
Nines, France are well-known structures
and convincing evidence of the high
degree to which ancient engineering had
developed.
As knowledge becomes more complete
we find it possible to systematize the ac-
cumulated observations and facts by
means of mathematical expressions which
can be used by the engineer in his need
for extending the range and application
of present knowledge to the solution of
new problems. As the modern engineer
encounters new problems he therefore be-
comes more dependent upon the language
and procedures of mathematics to arrive
at the more reliable and specific solutions.
Accordingly, an ever greater reliance is
being placed upon the use of higher
mathematics in engineering, particularly
in those fields where it is necessary to ex-
tend rapidly our limited knowledge be-
yond the frontiers of past experience in
the solution of new and exacting prob-
lems as encountered in the development
of guided missiles, earth satellites, nuclear
energy, electronic computing machines,
etc.
Recent developments in engineering
place increasing emphasis upon the im-
portance of a different way of denning
the engineering profession. Engineering
can be defined by function as well as by
the recognized area or field of application.

Does Du Pont
have summer
jobs for
students?
waiter A. Paulson, honor student at Pratt Institute, Brooklyn,
and member of the honorary engineering fraternity, Tau Beta Pi,
expects to receive his B.S. in Chemical Engineering in June 1957.
He is interested in the professional advantages that a student may
derive from technical experience obtained during summer work.
Bob Carter answers:
Robert O. Carter received his M.S. in industrial engineering
from Ohio State in 1951 and joined Du Pont soon afterward.
After varied plant experience, he recently undertook an inter-
esting new assignment in the Polychemicals Department at
Du Pont's Sabine River Works, Orange, Texas. The major func-
tion of his current work is to coordinate cost information as an
aid in maintaining cost control.
YOU bet we do, Walt! They're part of a regular Tech-
nical Training Program which Du Pont has had for
years.
Ordinarily we try to assign summer employees to work
'which ties in with their fields of training in college and
with their long-range interests. Informal or formal instruc-
tion on Company matters is usually provided.
We're definitely in favor of these summer contacts, for
they provide students with practical technical experience
and make them more valuable to industry when they
graduate. And it gives us a chance to become better
acquainted, too, with some of the men we'll be consider-
ing for permanent employment, later. It's a program of
mutual benefit.
In addition to the Formal Technical Training Program,
we frequently have a number of vacation replacement
jobs and other temporary positions which are available
to college students.
Last summer we hired a total of 720 students from 171
different colleges and universities. Most of these were
juniors, or were graduate students about one year away
from permanent employment.
You can see our program is a fairly substantial one,
Walt.

PHOTO QUIZ
so open those eyes
Well, is everyone all ready to go on
this month's photo quiz? We had a really
fine turnout on our first quiz, and the re-
sults should be in soon on the January
quiz? One thing I'd like to point out;
many of the identifications have not been
specific enough. For example, the pic-
ture in the January issue of the south
stand for the light in front of the Alumni
Memorial Building was identified by
many as either the north or south, with
no distinction between the two. These
answers are not correct, because the lo-
cations are not specifically identified as to
location.
But there were so many answers so
near correct (with the same postmark),
with only one of the three locations given
incorrectly, that the quizzes in the future
will have to be made more difficult. So
we'll just have to knuckle down and be a
little more observant as these hard-work-
ing days slide by. Better luck this time.
For the benefit of those who missed the
first and second time, the rules are:
1. All locations must be specifically
identified as to exact spot on particular
building, or grounds, etc.
2 The correct postcard bearing the
earliest postmark will be declared the
winning one.
3. All postcards must be mailed to the
Technic office:
The Michigan Technic
3505 East Eng. Bldg.

4. All Technic and Arch staff members
are ineligible for the five dollar prize.
5. In case of ties, each winner will re-
ceive the full five dollars.
6. Decision of the judges is final.

A car running on peanut oil
seems impossible, but it may
happen within the next ten
years.
by BARRY PEBBLES, '60E
Today the "big three" in automobiles—
General Motors, Chrysler, and Ford—
are all working at top speed to be the
first to develop the free piston engine,
a completely new type of automotive mo-
tor. This revolutionary type of engine,
with such features as the ability to run on
peanut oil or other cheap fuels, is sure
to be a big milestone in the automotive
industry when it is perfected.
Although the principle of the free
piston engine has been known for nearly
30 years and has been used, to some
extent, in ships and power plants, we
are just now getting around to adapting
it to use in automobiles. The principle
behind the free piston is fairly simple
but actually applying it to an automobile
engine poses many problems. Basically
the free piston engine is just a cylinder
and two opposed pistons. These pistons
derive their name from the fact that
they are not connected to a crankshaft
and driveshaft. Instead they are used
to compress air to drive a turbine which
is connected to the driveshaft. When fuel
is exploded between the pistons they
are driven apart and then bounce back
from a resilient cushion of air at either
end of the cylinder. This motion is the
bellow effect that forces the compressed
air into the turbine.
It should be obvious that the free pis-
ton engine is very similar to another
type of new engine, the gas turbine. The
fact is that after the air reaches the tur-
bine the mechanism is exactly the same
in both engines. The turbine in both
engines is similar to that used in a
turbo-prop airplane engine. Cheap fuel
is burned to create a blast of exhaust
gases which spin a turbine which is
connected by gears to a driveshaft. The
difference between the two types of en-
gines is the fact that the gas turbine
uses an air compressor to provide the
high pressure air to mix with the fuel in
the combustion chamber while the free
piston engine makes the pistons them-
selves do this task.
Now, let's examine the free piston en-
gine in a little more detail—if that is
possible. The competition between the
big companies to perfect this engine is so
keen that they will give out only the most
basic information. Details are scarce but
you should be able to get the general
idea of the engine.
The power stroke of this two-cycle
engine starts with the pistons close to-
gether with air and fuel compressed
between them. Like a Diesel engine the
free piston engine has no spark plugs
but instead relies on the compression of
the mixture for ignition. Although no
information is available explaining the
fuel setup it is almost certain that some
type of fuel injector is used.
As the mixture explodes the pistons
are forced backwards into two airtight
chambers. Naturally, the air in these
airtight "bounce chambers" is compressed
Barry Peebles, author of "Free Piston Engines," is a freshman
in Science Engineering. Writing for the Technic is a "natural"
for him, since at one time he had decided to study journalism.
Along this line he was editor of the Blissfield (Michigan) High
School paper for two years, has written a number of articles for
a daily newspaper; and attended a journalism course at North-
western University, in 1955.
At present Barry hasn't decided which particular field of
engineering he will eventually pursue but says he favors E.E.

tors experimental car, the XP-500, shows
the main features of the free piston
engine. This is one of two pistons on the
road today. The other is owned by
the Ford Motor Co.
(Courtesy of Popular Science Monthly)
which, as the name implies, causes the
pistons to bounce back to their original
position. As the pistons are still moving
outward from the center, fresh air is
being sucked into the combustion cham-
ber while part of the exhaust gases are
rushing out to turn the turbine. Then, as
the pistons are bouncing back, they com-
press the fresh air and force some of it
out, with the rest of the exhaust gases,
into the turbine. However, enough com-
pressed air is left in the combustion
chamber for the next power stroke. This
cycle of explosion, "bounce," and com-
pression is then repeated. It is quite dif-
ferent from the four-cycle reciprocating
engine of today where only one out of
four strokes is a power stroke.
There are several big advantages of
the free piston engine over today's auto-
mobile motors. The big one that we have
already mentioned is that it can run on
almost any cheap fuel. Although it will
run on peanut or whale oil it is prob-
able that kerosene will be the basic fuel.
Another advantage of the free piston en-
gine stems from the fact that there is no
crankshaft, connecting rods, and very few
other rotating parts. For this reason only
a few high-precision parts are needed
and friction is greatly reduced. Also the
free piston engine is inherently so well
balanced that it operates with little vibra-
tion.
An advantage that the free piston en-
gine has over the gas turbine is the fact
that the hot exhaust gases are diluted
with fresh air before being forced into the
turbine. Since the turbine blades do not
have to spin in destructively high tem-
peratures there is no need for expensive
and hard-to-work alloys that are needed
in the gas turbine engine.
However, the free piston is not exact-
ly the ideal engine at the present time.
Many problems still face the engineers

before the free piston engine can be
put into production. The biggest one is
how to get flashy acceleration and quick
starts out of a turbine engine that idles
at 5,000 rpm but that has to be advanced
to 16,000 rpm before the car begins to
get some pickup. This is a problem that
faces both the gas turbine and the free
piston engines.
Another problem that will take a lot of
work to iron out is the gear train that
reduces the very high rpm of the turbine
down to the comparatively low number
of revolutions required on the driveshaft.
At the present this gear train makes a lot
of objectionable noise, but the experts
believe that money and laboratory time
will remedy this situation.
That is a general picture of the free
piston engine at the present—how it
works, its advantages, and its disadvan-
tages. But what will the free piston en-
gine mean to you, the guy behind the
wheel, in the future. Most experts be-
lieve that it will be at least ten years
before the free piston hits the dealers
showrooms. It is true that prototypes
have already been built and driven on the
highways by both General Motors and
Ford. However, both companies say that
they have many bugs to iron out yet.
When either the free piston or the gas
turbine hit the highways it will mark the
first major advance in automobiles since
1938 when Oldsmobile brought out the
automatic transmission. For this reason
it is easy to see why the competition is
so keen to be the first to develop the
free piston engine. You can be sure that
when it hits the market an upheaval will
be felt all the way from the dealers
showrooms to the gas and oil industries.

George Granger Brown, Dean of Engineering, is the author
of "Your Function in Engineering." After obtaining his B.S.
degree from New York University, he came to the University of
Michigan for his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees. Dean Brown has
written many books and articles for technical and professional
journals and has won the William H. Walker Award and the
Hanlon Award for his contribution to chemical engineering lit-
erature. He is also a member of many educational and profes-
sional engineering societies.
These functions, such as research, de-
velopment, design, production, construc-
tion, operation, management, etc., are
each best performed by men who have
common aptitudes. It requires the same
general aptitudes to conduct research in
any field of engineering, be it electrical,
mechanical, chemical or any other branch
of engineering, and these aptitudes are
quite different from those required for
successful operation of facilities or of
management in any industry.
A man's satisfaction in bis work and
the rewards he receives are rather directly
related to his aptitude or ability to per-
form a certain function. The functional
classification is therefore a most meaning-
ful basis for planning one's career. Yet this
classification of engineering activities ac-
cording to function is not generally pre-
sented to a young man considering an
engineering career. He is usually asked
to consider which field is more attractive
to him, such as civil, mechanical, electri-
cal, chemical or any other of the twenty
varieties or branches of engineering now
recognized by the Education Committee of
the Engineers' Council for Professional
Development, or the 47 varieties repre-
sented by the various engineering so-
cieties. These branches are based upon the
ancient concept of engineering founded
upon empirical experience and judgment
rather than upon a fully developed scien-
tific approach now required of most mod-
ern engineers. These branches are popular
because they appeal to the student's in-
terest; but his aptitudes are most closely
related to the function of engineering
and his satisfaction and success.
/ do not mean to detract from the im-
portance of the well established branches
of engineering, but rather to emphasize
the even greater importance to the man
planning his career of the functional
classification.
Unfortunately, the well established en-
gineering educational programs through-
out the country usually attempt to pre-
pare a man for all possible functions
within a given field of activity. While this
may have been sound and adequate at the
time when most of these branches were
being created, there is some question
about this concept being adequate for
modern conditions.
"For work in research, development,
and design, the engineer must have in-
tensive training in science and mathe-
matics. Imagination and creativity in
scientific aspects and skill in experimen-
tation are important qualifications. On the
other hand knowledge of engineering
practice and skill in handling economic
factors are not so important.
"In the functions of construction, pro-
duction, operation and maintenance, the
major emphasis is on . . . solving tech-
nological problems economically, efficient-
ly and on schedule. For work in these
functions the feeling for what machines
and men can do is important. There is
need for skill in human relations and in
solving personal problems of a type
which may not enter into a research engi-
neer's work. On the other hand the prep-
aration in science and mathematics is
somewhat less important than for research
and design.
"Management, industrial, and sales
functions are similar in that human and
economic factors are frequently more im-
portant than technological factors. The
engineer's personal characteristics may be
more important than his scientific train-
ing. Problems tend to be more qualitative
in nature than in the other functions, and
precise mathematical methods are not
necessary. Sensitivity in human relations
and understanding of basic human drives
are necessary for success."—Engineering

The three preceding paragraphs indi-
cate tjjree broad classifications of engi-
neering activities according to functions
in order of decreasing mathematical and
scientific aptitudes and training, and in
order of increasing aptitude in human
relations and economic factors. No one of
these should be regarded as higher than
any other, but simply demanding different
aptitudes.
Engineering is an attitude or an ap-
proach rather than a specific; at one ex-
treme the engineer is concerned with
colossal structures and tremendous en-
ergies; at the other end of the size scale-
he is solving the mysteries of molecular
structure and the behavior of electrons.
Some of his activities are in the realm
of theoretical science, and others depend
entirely on practical experience. Some of
his problems are purely technical and
quantitative while others require a fine
sense of human relations for their solu-
tion. The distinguishing characteristic of
an engineer's work is the emphasis on
quantitative thinking and his ability to
express his ideas clearly and concisely,
verbally and graphically.
Ability in mathematics is most closely
associated with success in an engineering
school. But success afterwards may de-
pend even more upon effective mastery of
the English language and one's ability to
transmit ideas in words and sketches; or
to get along well with people and to pro-
vide leadership which others are willing
to follow, depending upon one's function
within the broad field of engineering.
Success in engineering requires interest,
aptitudes, and drive. However, a defi-
ciency in one characteristic can be com-
pensated for by extra strength in the
others.

in the field of Materials Engineering
In the field of chemistry, investi-
gations are made of fuels, high-tem-
perature lubricants, elastomeric
compounds, electro-chemical and or-
ganic coatings. Inorganic substances,
too, must be prepared and their
properties determined.
While materials engineering as-
signments, themselves, involve dif-
ferent types of engineering talent,
the field is only one of a broadly
diversified engineering program at
Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft. That
program — with other far-reaching
activities in the fields of mechanical
design, aerodynamics, combustion
and instrumentation — spells out a
gratifying future for many of to-
day's engineering students.

The development of more advanced,
far more powerful aircraft engines
depends to a high degree on the de-
velopment of new and improved
materials and methods of processing
them. Such materials and methods,
of course, are particularly important
in the nuclear field.
At Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, the
physical, metallurgical, chemical
and mechanical properties of each
new material are studied in minute
detail, compared with properties of
known materials, then carefully ana-
lyzed and evaluated according to
their potential usefulness in aircraft
engine application.
The nuclear physics of reactor
materials as well as penetration and
effects of radiation on matter are
important aspects of the nuclear re-
actor program now under way at
P &amp; W A. Stress analysis by strain
gage and X-ray diffraction is an-
other notable phase of investigation.
In the metallurgical field, mate-
rials work involves studies of corro-
sion resistance, high-temperature
mechanical and physical properties
of metals and alloys, and fabrication
techniques.
Mechanical-testing work delves
into design and supervision of test
equipment to evaluate fatigue, wear,
and elevated-temperature strength
of materials. It also involves deter-
mination of the influence of part
design on these properties.

Leonard
Eu!
er
A short biography of one of the most
famous mathematicians of the 18th cen-
tury.
Leonard Euler was one of the most
distinguished mathematicians in the age
of distinguished mathematicians, the
18th century. He was the son of Paul
Euler, and Margaret Brucker, and was
born at Basle, in 1708; and when Leon-
ard had arrived at the proper age, his
father instilled into him a fondness for
mathematics, although he intended him
to enter the study of theology. He was
later sent to the University of Basle,
where he was found worthy to receive
lessons from John Bernoulli, who was
regarded, at the time, as the first mathe-
matician in Europe. The assiduity and
good disposition of Euler soon gained
for him the particular favor of the great
master, and the friendship of his two
sons, Daniel and Nicolas Bernoulli. John
Bernoulli even condescended to Leonard
a special lesson by himself, for the pur-
pose of explaining the difficulties which
he encountered during the course of his
studies. However, Euler did not have
the good fortune to enjoy this extreme
advantage for very long. In 1723 he re-
ceived his Master of Arts degree; and on
this occasion he perceived a great ovation
for the Latin discourse which he deliv-
ered, containing a comparison between
the Newtonian and Cortesian philosophy.
At his father's request he then began the
study of theology; but his love of mathe-
matics was too strong and his father
finally consented to allow him to follow
the bent of his own genius.
Nicolas and Daniel Bernoulli having
accepted the invitation of Catherine I to
become members of the Academy of
Science at St. Petersburg in 1725, prom-
ised at their departure to try and procure
Euler an appointment in that city. The
very next year they announced that they
thought they had just the position for
him, and strongly advised him to apply
his mathematical knowledge to physiol-
ogy. Euler immediately attended the lec-
tures of the most eminent medical pro-
fessors at Basle, and rapidly became fa-
miliar with the subject. He still spent his
spare time, however, following his favor-
ite pursuits. He found leisure time to
compose a dissertation on the Nature and
Propagation of Sound, and another on
the Masting of Ships, which he presented
in hopes of winning the prize offered by
the Academy of Science in 1727. The
subject was actually picked by several
members of the academy, with the idea
of bringing mt0 public view the talents
of M. Bouguer, who had dedicated him-
self to this subject and who was a pro-
fessor of hydrography in the seaport
town of Croisic. It was not surprising
that Euler, who had no practical knowl-
edge of ships or sailing, was not able
to win the first prize; but he obtained
second prize, a great honor considering
he was only twenty years old. He was
considered for a vacant professorship of
natural philosophy at the University of
Basle but his youth again prevented him
from being selected and the position was
given to an older man.
Daniel and Nocolas Bernoulli used
all their influence to procure an appoint-
ment for their young friend; and having
finally succeeded they requested him to
come immediately to St. Petersburg. Euler
lost no time in obeying this welcome sum-
mons, but after he had begun his journey
he learned that Nicolas had died from
his inability to adjust to the climate. On
the very day which he entered the Rus-
sian territory Catherine I, empress of
Russia died, an event which at first threat-
ened the dissolution of the academy, of
which she had been founder. Having
reached St. Petersburg at this unfortunate

AUTOMATIC
FLIGHT
CONTROL
Fig. 2. Gyro gimbals schematic.
by FRED STEGENGA, '57A.E.
Autopilots have been in aircraft for a
long time. The men who fly the bomber,
cargo and passenger planes have come to
regard them as an extra pilot, especially
on long missions and in bad weather. The
autopilot's ability to smooth out the ride,
and at the same time to relieve the pilot
of the dull chore of flying the aircraft,
has made it almost an integral part of the
plane.
A few years ago, an autopilot was put
in a plane as an accessory, often consider-
ed an unnecessary luxury. The pilot
would hesitantly engage it without much
confidence that it could actually fly the
plane. Today, however, some daring
young pilot may very timidly turn off his
automatic equipment just to see what
will happen. Aircraft manufacturers
have come to rely on automatic flight con-
trols to give their planes the flying charac-
teristics their customers and pilot want.
What is an Autopilot?
Automatic flight control is achieved by
the use of the autopilot. Therefore, let us
define automatic flight control as the
means for directing and stabilizing the
aircraft without using the action of the
pilot.1 In other words, when an autopilot
l From talk by Mr. Ross Fleisits of Sperry Gyro-
rope Co.
is engaged it will perform its functions
without the use of the pilot's strength. It
will have its own set of "muscles" so to
speak. Perhaps the simplest job that we
could give an autopilot would be to fly in
a given direction. Let us assume that the
pilot wants to fly straight west. With a
relatively simple yaw autopilot he could
engage it, once airborne, set it for a due
west course and forget it. The autopilot
would automatically keep the plane flying
west.
Before we go on, it would be wise to
define some terms that appear frequently
in the discussion of stability and control
of aircraft.
First we must define an axes system for
our plane. It is free to fly in three space
directions. Therefore, we take a set of
coordinates with three dimensions. We
conveniently pick a right hand set of
orthogonal axes. We likewise convenient-
ly orient this set of axes to the aircraft
by putting the origin at the center of
gravity of the aircraft and the x-axis
along the fuselage of the aircraft, the
positive x-axis lying toward the nose of
the plane (See figure one.). The positive
y-axis lies out the right wing and the
positive z-axis lies perpendicular to the x
and y-axes and is positive in the direction
of the gravity or weight vector when the
plane is in straight and level flight.
Yawing . . . When we speak of the
airplane yawing, we mean essentially
that the plane is rotating around the
z-axis of its body axis system. In other
words, if the plane is in straight, level
flight and it yaws, its heading or direc-
tion of flight changes.
Pitching . . . When the plane pitches
we mean that it is rotating around its
y-axis. If the plane is in straight, level
flight, and then pitches, the nose of the
plane will go up or down, i.e., it will
start to climb or descend.
Rolling . . . When the plane rolls we
mean that it is rotating around its x-axi*.
If the plane is in straight, level flight and
starts to roll to the right, then the right
wing will go down and under the plane,
and the left wing will go up and over.
Yaw Automatic Pilot
In all practical automatic light control
systems, the feedback closed loop princi-
ple developed originally by the electrical
engineers, is used. Consider for example
figure 3.
In this system, the yaw angle of the
aircraft is measured by a direction.il
gyro. See Figure 2 for a schematic pic-
ture of gyro mechanism. This gyro
is aligned so that its long period or
steady state reference axis is oriented
with respect to magnetic north. This
62

is accomplished by slaving the spin
axis of the directional gyro to the hori-
zontal component of the earth's magnetic
field. For this purpose a flux valve is used
to sense magnetic north. In the electrical
circuitry of the servo amplifier, the sig-
nal received from the slaved gyro is
compared to the signal corresponding to
the commanded yaw angle. If the differ-
ence of these two signals is zero, then the
plane is on course. If, however, the dif-
ference is not zero then this signal, called
the error signal, is amplified and used to
drive a servo motor which is connected
to the rudder. This motor causes a deflec-
tion in the rudder and thus changes the
yaw angle of the plane. The new yaw
angle is then fed back into the servo am-
plifier and compared to the command
yaw angle. This control loop continues to
function, comparing command and actual
signals, until the desired values are ob-
tained.
Yaw dynamic characteristics, the re-
sponse of the aircraft heading to changes
in yaw command, are mainly a function
of the dynamic configuration of the servo
amplifier, servo rudder motor, and air-
craft dynamics in yaw. By proper man-
ipulation of the amplifier circuitry
we can change the dynamic charac-
teristics of the aircraft. Perhaps the air-
craft, when disturbed from a straight
west flight path, tends to oscillate between
west-northwest and west-southwest for a
long period of time. With proper ampli-
fier circuitry this oscillation can be damp-
ed out. (See figure 4).
This same principle can be applied to
the pitch and roll axes. For this case we
can use the same gyro for both axes, a

device is properly oriented on the vertical
gyro gimbals we will get a signal corre-
sponding to a roll motion and a signal
corresponding to a pitching motion. By
comparing the command signal given by
the pilot to the signal given by the verti-
cal gyro and using the difference of these
two signals, an error signal is given to
the amplifier to be used in driving the
servo mechanism. The servo mechanism
for the roll axis would drive the control
surfaces located on the wings, called
ailerons. The servo motor for the pitch
axis drives the horizontal control surface
on the tail called the elevator.
By combining these three components
we have a simple three loop, three axes
autopilot using the feed back principle.
This autopilot will stabilize flight in all
three axes and will permit the pilot to set
a course and to engage the autopilot to
remain on it. The plane will then fly at
this altitude until a different command
signal is given by the pilot.
This autopilot will, however, give op-
timum performance only at a certain flight
speed and altitude, and, it does not have
any control over these parameters. To
give optimum performance at all airspeeds
it is possible to add a component that
will change the amplifier circuitry in
such a manner that it will give prop-
er response characteristics at all flight
speeds. This is called parameter control.
If an airspeed compensator is put in the
servo amplifier circuit it is possible to
automatically change the amplifier cir-
cutry so as to give optimum response.
This component will also give us control
over airspeed so that the pilot can set an
airspeed and have it maintained automati-
cally. This device would use a pilot-static
tube for velocity computation. The pitot
static tube gives two pressures—a static
and a dynamic pressure. From the dif-
ference between dynamic and static pres-
sures the indicated airspeed is computed.
From the static pressure the altitude is
computed. The autopilot can be equipped
with an altitude control that will, by
proper linkage to the autopilot's pitch
axis loop, make the plane nose down to
the correct altitude if too high, or nose
up if too low.
Automatic Landing
All major airports have the I.L.S. (In-
strument Landing System) radio beam
signals transmitted down their major
runways. This signal is made up of two
beams. One beam called the "localizer
beam" is trans mitted down the runway

other beam is called the glide path beam
and is transmitted at 2.5 degrees to the

runway the signal is different than if the
plane is to the left of the runway. Also, if
the plane is above the glide path the sig-
nal is different than when below the glide
path. A pilot with a radio receiver can lis-
ten to this signal and fly the plane in for
a landing without looking at the ground
until the final 50-100 feet of approach.
He can tell by the sound of the radio

How to ground a flying sorcerer
Even the most imaginative soothsayer would be
brought to earth if he could peer into the minds
of some of our Chrysler Corporation engineers!
Things he would never dream of in his soaring
flights of fancy are turning over in the minds of
the men whose job it is to plan and create future
Chrysler Corporation cars. These engineers are
stirred, but never stymied, by the "impossible."
And from this "never-say-no" philosophy . . .
from the farsighted imagination of Chrysler Cor-
poration engineers down through the years have
come many distinguished automotive firsts. Push-
button driving . . . the first practical automotive

different things ... of pioneering beyond the
automotive horizon in such dramatic fields as

period, Euler resolved to enter the Rus-
sian navy, and had actually received the
promise of a lieutenancy, and rapid
promotion, from Admiral Sievens, but
fortunately for geometry, a change took
place in the aspect of public affairs in
1730, and Euler obtained the Professor-
ship of Natural Philosophy. In 1733 he
succeeded Daniel Bernoulli, when he re-
tired to live in the country. In the same
year he married Mademoiselle Gsell, a
Swiss lady. In 1735, a very intricate
problem having been proposed by the
Academy of St. Petersburg, Euler com-
pleted the solution of it in three days,
but the exertion of his mind had been so
violent, that it threw him into a fever
which endangered his life, and deprived
him of the use of one of his eyes. In
1738, the Academy of Science of Paris
crowned his memoir, entitled "Sur la
Nature et les Proprietes du Fevi" and in
1740 he divided, with Daniel Bernoulli
and Colin Maclaurin, the prize given by
the same academy for the best dissertation
on the flux and reflux of the sea. Daniel
Bernoulli had treated the subject with a
sagacity and method which characterized
all his labors. The dissertation of Mac-
laurin contained his celebrated theorem
on the equilibrium of elliptical spheroids;
and that of Euler was marked with an
improvement in integral calculus.
In consequence of an invitation from
the King of Prussia, through his minister
the Count de Mardefield, Euler quit St.
Petersburg and went to Berlin in June,
1741. Upon his arrival, he was honored
with a letter from the king of Prussia,
written from his camp at Reichenbach.
He was soon after presented to the queen-
mother, who took great pleasure in con-
versing with illustrious men. She treated
Euler with the utmost familiarity but
soon became discouraged because he
would always answer her in monosylla-
bles. One day she asked him why he did
not wish to speak to her. He replied,
"Madam, it is because I have just come
from a country where every person who
speaks is hanged."
The memoirs and works with which
Euler enriched mathematics and physics
are so numerous it would take many pages
just to list them. In many of his physical
memoirs, Euler has been justly reproach-
ed for having applied calculus to the
most unfounded physical hypotheses, or
to metaphysical principles which had not
been sufficiently examined; and on this
account several of his memoirs have no
value whatever, except that they show
fine resourceful analysis. His Dissertations
on Windmills, on Archromatic Tele-
scopes, on Naval Architecture, and on
Gunnery, are among the number of his
works liable for this criticism.
When Euler was in Berlin, the Prin-
cess of Anhalt Dessan, the niece of the
King of Prussia, wished to receive in-
structions from him in the different
branches of Natural Philosophy. For her
use he drew up probably his most famed
work, which was translated into almost
all the languages of Europe, and which
gained high esteem, particularly for tin.
singular perspicuity with which Euler ex-
plained some of the most profound truths
in physics. The King of Prussia often em-
ployed Euler in calculations relative to
the mint, and other objects of finance, in
the conducting of waters of Sans Souci.
in the examination of canals, and in other
public works.
In 1744, Euler was appointed Director
of the Mathematical Class of the Acad-
emy, and in the same year he obtained
the prize offered by the Academy of Sci-
ences at Paris for the best work on the
theory of magnetism.
About this time Robin's Treatise on
Gunnery had appeared in England, and
although Robin had treated Euler with
great severity, Euler disregarded this in-
justice and recommended the book to the

VULCAN GUN
A rapid-firing 20 millimeter weapon,
one of the first specifically designed for
present supersonic jet aircraft, was recent-
ly unveiled at Aberdeen Proving Ground,
Maryland.
Development of the new 20 millimeter
cannon was prompted by the tremendous
increase in speed of modern jet aircraft.
Until the development of Vulcan,
armament fire power rates had lagged
behind the speeds of jet aircraft. Vulcan
now fulfills the requirement of a weapon
capable of firing at an extraordinarily-

The new 20 millimeter cannon hn

INDUSTRIES THAT MAKE AMERICA GREAT
TRANSPORTATION...
FREEDOM'S GIANT
We sometimes become so bemused with
its astronomical facts and figures that we
are apt to regard the transportation in-
dustry as an end in itself.
But transportation has grown into a
giant because it represents the translation
into reality of some basic precepts of de-
mocracy . . . freedom to think, freedom
to buy and sell, freedom to move about
as we please. The resultant interchange
of ideas, people and goods has inevitably
led to the development of large-scale,
efficient transportation. It is thus no ac-
cident that history's greatest democracy
should also have history's greatest trans-
portation system to serve it.
The transportation industry itself has
never lost sight of its basic origins. Cogni-
zant of its responsibility to the nation, it
has always reinvested large amounts of its
earnings in plant expansion, in engineer-
ing, in research—all for the development
of better and more efficient methods,
machines and conveyances. That is why
American cars, planes, ships and trains
are able to supply their services so effi-
ciently and abundantly.
The science of steam generation for
power, processing and heating in the
transportation industry has likewise kept
pace with the demand for greater effi-
ciency. B&amp;W, whose boiler designs power
such giant vessels as the 5. S. United
States, continues to invest large amounts
of its own earnings in research and en-
gineering to discover better ways to gen-
erate steam for ships and trains, for
power plants and factories. The Babcock

gave me a 20-minute discourse on the
value and beauty of the enlargements he
would make from any small snapshot I
had of big old handsome me. At the end
I said, "No prota Svenska." When it
looked like he was switching to sign lan-
guage, I threw him out, oblivious and
immune to his Swedish protests.
After I was in the strip mill one week
the works vacation began. The whole
works shut down and every man who has
worked at Uddeholm for at least one
year gets a three week paid vacation. Only
a handful of repairmen remained at each
plant. So for the following weeks I was
helping to repair the main stand in the
strip mill. It was greasy and heavy but
not continuous work, which I performed
till the end of my stay in Hagfors.
An idea of Swedish social life can per-
haps be given by relating two of the social
visits I made.
The first was an invitation from Buse,
an 18-year-old fellow worker, who in-
vited Ove and me out to his home. So
after supper I borrowed a bike and we
rode the five miles to Buse's house, went
swimming in one of the many lakes that
dotted the countryside. Later we came
back to his house, listened to Louis Arm-
strong records and had coffee and cake.
Armstrong is the idol of most Swedish
teenagers. Buse's home is small but
everything is typically neat. The coffee
and cake was served in his room by his
sister very quietly after a call from him.
After serving she left immediately. Buse
had yelled to his mother to make the
coffee as we came in.
The second was an evening with a
Finnish worker who invited Marti, a Fin-
nish prakticant who spoke English, and
me over for coffee, again. When we
first came in we met his wife who is
Swedish, blonde and pretty, and that's the
last we saw of her except when she
quietly served coffee and cake. Talk
ranged from Finnish history to Ameri-
can traditions and social standards. Their
apartment was in a housing project built
by the company and ceded to the city. It
was modern, attractive, well kept, and
the rent was low—about $40 a month
for four rooms.
By this time I had gotten to know the
prakticants that I lived with pretty well.
There was Ove (pronounced oover), a
Swedish boy from Stockholm, about
nineteen, friendly and spoke English
well. I had many long talks with him
comparing Swedish ways to American
ways. From these talks it appeared to me
that the Swedish school system was rigor-
ous and uncompromising and advanced
education seemed restricted to the excep-
tionally intelligent or the wealthy. Start-
ing school at seven, the average Swede
would finish at fifteen and go to work.
Those who wanted higher education and
could afford it changed to their equiva-
lent of our high school at fourteen and
went till eighteen. Graduation is not
automatic but depends on passing com-
prehensive exams. One could then go to
college if he could pass the stiff entrance
exams and afford it. There were scholar-
ships available but only for a few of the
smartest.
£)jeter—a German boy about twenty,
ve(y conservative but friendly. His father
was chief engineer in a large plant in
Germany. He once stated that "Soon
Adenaur will lose power, a nationalistic
party which is anti-U. S. will take over.
Relations will get worse; in ten years
Germany's coal will give out," and calmly
concluded, "then there will be krieg
(war)," as if it were a natural and ex-
pected part of life.
Reinhard—a young, very likable Aus-
trian, spoke excellent English he learned
from American G. I.'s.
And Marti—a Finnish prakticant whose
home town was almost at the Arctic Cir-
cle, spoke little English but was very
friendly and very ambitious. He was a
good worker as most Finns I met seemed
to be. Still going to high school, he was
one of a total of four boys in the town's
high school.
There were several other prakticants
who lived in private homes and a half
dozen who came toward the end of my
stay. A few Germans, Austrians and a
boy from Burma.
After seven weeks I left Hagfors and
toured the continent, visiting Hamburg,
Paris, Lausanne, Geneva, Monte Carlo,
Rome, Venice, Vienna and Amsterdam,
but that's another story. For those who
are interested, trans-Atlantic transporta-
tion cost $350, I saved $50 in Sweden
and spent $450 for five weeks of touring
exclusive of gifts. I didn't learn too much
technically speaking, but it was interest-
ing, a heck of a lot of fun and very edu-
cational in things other than technical.

French, and introduced it into the schools
of artillery.
In 1746 he published his "theory of

In 1750, Euler went to Frankfort to

When Euler remained in Berlin, he
formed an intimate friendship with M.
Maupertuis, the learned president of the
Prusian Academy of Sciences, and he
defended Maupertuis's celebrated and
favorite principle of the least actions by
resolving by means of it, some of the
most difficult problems in mechanics. In
the dispute which followed with Koenig,
Frederick the Second, surnamed the Great,
who attacked Maupertuis in 1751, he lost
his usual serenity and became one of the
great enemies of that individual.
Although the number of foreign asso-

In 1760, the Russian army penetrating
into Prussia, pillaged a farm which Euler
possessed near Charlottenburg. When the
Russian general was informed of the

A new radical development in artificial lighting.
One must wonder whether, on the
memorable day Thomas Edison first suc-
cessfully operated his incandescent lamp,
thereby giving birth to a new era of light,
the Great Inventor could have possibly
conceived the future advancement of arti-
ficial lighting.
Since the earliest stages of incandes-
cent lamp improvement, the only radical
development achieved by lighting engi-
neers had been that of flourescent light-
ing. Now, however, the greatest advance
in artificial lighting since its inception is
just beginning to emerge from the ex-
perimental stages.
The first full-scale presentation of
man's newest light source—electronic
light—was made recently when West-
inghouse Electric Corporation unveiled
a room lighted by electroluminescence.
Panels no thicker than window glass line
the ceiling and three walls, giving off
light (approximately 30 foot-candles)
equivalent to that in a modern, well-
lighted office or class room.
One hundred and twelve glass panels,
each one foot square in size and giving
off a soft green glow, are used to illum-
inate the room with shadowless light.
Walls and ceilings of the room are not
lighted, but are light sources themselves,
treating an atmosphere of light without
light fixtures.
The glow comes from a powdered
phosphor bound in polyvinyl chloride-
plastic and sprayed on the surface of a
glass plate as thin as an ordinary window.
On the side that emits the light, the glass
is coated with a transparent, but electri-
cally conducting film.
The reverse side is covered with alum-
inum, which also conducts electricity. The
panel thus resembles a capacitator, with
two conducting layers separated by a di-
electric. When an electric current is turn-
ed into this electronic "sandwich", the
phosphor in the middle becomes acti-
vated and commences glowing. The elec-
tricity applied is 350 volt, 3000 cycle a-c.
Brightness of the panels is 100 ft 1am-
berts and efficiency is 3 lumens per watt.
At present there is still some uncer-
tainty about the future of electrolumines-
cence. The answer depends on how high
brightness and efficiency can be raised in
a practical installation.
One firm claims experimental electro-
luminescence cells that reach 2000 foot
lamberts (12.6 standard candles — 1 lu-
men; 1 sq. ft. emitting one lumen = 1
foot lambert).
For comparison, a standard flourescent
lamp has a brightness of about 1900 foot-
lamberts, and luminous ceilings (fluores-
cents behind translucent plastic) are
usually under 300 ft. lamberts.
While engineering efficiencies are
usually a simple statement of effective
energy output compared to energy input,
lamp efficiency directly involves the limit-
ed ability of humans to see electromag-
netic radiation.
Only a minute fraction of radiation
emitted by solar or other incandescent
sources is perceived by the human eye;
in addition, it is much more sensitive
to colors in the center of the visible spec-
trum than to those at the ends.
Thus, a yellow light will appear far
brighter to the naked eye, thereby gaining
a higher lumen rating, than a deep red
light of the same absolute intensity.
Jt works out that the maximum theoret-
ical efficiency for the electric lamp is
about 400 lumens per watt, assuming i
"white" light of excellent (but not per-
fect) quality.
A modern 100-watt incandescent lamp
has an efficiency of about 16 lumens per
watt, or about 4% of the theoretical 400.
When the fluorescent lamp was de-
veloped, it became possible for the first
time to have light output concentrated
almost entirely within the visible spec-
trum. Thus, the original flourescent in
1938 achieved an efficiency of about
12%, a figure since raised to about l69r-
The highest efficiency yet claimed for
electroluminescence is a mere 2%. What
is significant is that this new light source
appears to be free of the inherent limi-
tations that hold incandescent and fluor-
escent sources far below a theoretical
efficiency of 100%. Thus some research-
ers dream of reaching 50% or even
higher with electroluminescence.
First discovered in 1936, electrolumin-
escence, in its early days, was a laboratory
curiosity. One had to turn out all the
lights and adapt his eyes to the darkness
before the faint light could be seen.
Today, electroluminescence stands to
offer more than merely lighting alone.
Besides white light, electroluminescence
may be utilized in blue, orange, and
green. Some cells have been made to
c hange through all four colors by vary ing
the character of electricity applied.
Psychologically, this would have in-
teresting implications: hot days might
appear cooler by using a bluish white
light; drab and dreary days might be
"warmed" by changing the light to a red-
dish white.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


contributor to the Technic. Enrolled in the Mechanical Engi-
neering curriculum, he received an A.B. in English in 1953.
Although his chief interest is writing, material conditions
have influenced him to pursue an engineering career. His hobbies
include anything that is enjoyable and relaxing.
Bert Hilburger, the author of "Inertial Guidance", hails from
Buffalo, New York. He is a junior in Mechanical Engineering
which is to prepare him for graduate work in the Law School.
His interest in servo-mechanisms and flying gave birth to this
month's article. A member of the Chi Phi fraternity, Bert also
finds some time for sailing and photography.
Freeing light from the confines of
point or line sources, such as incandes-
cent or flourescent lamps, electrolumines-
cence promises to spark totally new con-
cepts of lighting. Light in the future will
be part of the construction of walls,
ceilings, and possibly even floors. And,
because electroluminescence is not re-
stricted to flat planes, light may go into
the construction of domes, ballustrades,
and other architectural design.
One major electronics corporation has
predicted that by 1975 TV sets will have
disappeared and that the picture will be
shown directly on the walls, through self-
lighting panels.
Whatever the future of electrolumines-
cence may be, its opportunities are end-
less, and without a doubt will soon be-
come a household word.
The progress of science and engineer-
ing in the past 25 years has been phenom-
enal, but when a development occurs,
such as electroluminescence, which is
strictly non-military in application, and
peaceful in utility, the achievement must
be doubly appreciated.
Incandescent- Light

Fluorescent- Light
From A Line
Electroluminescent-
Light From An Area
Electroluminescence is the latest step in
the trend in lighting towards larger light
sources, starting with the point source of
the bare filament in an incandescent
lamp. Later, incandescent lamps were
frosted creating, in effect, a globular
light source. Then fluorescent lamps
came along and light came from a line
source. Now, electroluminescence gives
us light from an area.

Exploring the Universe: Sub-Atomic Worlds.... To Greeks, the atom was literally "a-tomos,"
not to be cut. Now its very nucleus is split and scientists are tracking sub-atomic particles,
seeking to discover the nature —order and meaning —of a vast, dynamic universe in which domestic
notions of space and time and energy do not apply. Ethical corollary: The "finds" of nuclear
exploration must be employed not in the service of a scientific, or economic, or political provincialism
but wherever they are needful to the physical, mental and moral rehabilitation of men and of societies.

"Within the next century, all the world will be poor in energy
•.. except for atomic energy."
Can we say then—since there is a positive correlation between energy con-
sumption and national income, and between national income and individual
living standards—that many of today's children may see, and suffer from a
world-wide poverty?
The industrial West—metallurgy, combustion engines, chemistry, steam,
electricity, electronics—was built and is maintained by power derived from
fossil fuels. It is a "coal and oil" civilization and it, alone, in the next century
could consume all the free world's coal and oil resources.
Now, however, the once-agrarian East and Latin America—two-thirds of
the world's population—also are determined to have the benefits of industriali-
zation: power to conquer poverty and disease; power to create and maintain
an economic self-sufficiency; and, out of that, power to create and maintain
political freedom.
The practical developments of the Industrial Revolution that have so pro-
foundly changed the world economy since 1856 — the Bessemer converter,
aniline dyes, oil-cracking, the internal combustion engine, the electric motor,
electric light, electric power, synthetics, electric and electronic communica-
tion, automation and computation, the submarine, winged and wingless aircraft
and the space rocket—were the direct result of preceding theoretical explora-
tions by Galileo, Bacon, Newton, Gauss, Laplace, Faraday and those others
who could visualize new worlds.
The Atomic Revolution now overthrowing present conceptions of power,
(he view frOM lOO years transport, communication, medicine, agriculture and biology—and hence
colonial and collectivist politics—stems directly from the pure and applied
scientific research of Curie, Rutherford, Planck, Einstein, Bohr, Fermi, and
hundreds of others.
It is evident, then, that exploration of the universe is now requisite to our
survival as men and nations.
Thus, prospecting for new energy sources — whether in sub-atomic worlds,
in the atom, in the earth, in the sea, in the sun, or in the dynamics of stars-
is an enterprise for new scientist-manager-engineer-share owner groups. Cor-
porate "systems" with the research and development capabilities, the produc-
tion facilities, the financial capacity and the courage to fit out scientific
expeditions to new and far places — and to capitalize on their discoveries.
General Dynamics today is the product not only of its own particular history
but of the scientific and industrial history of the Western world. As such,
Dynamics declares its corporate purpose to be:
The comprehensive exploration and translation of the basic forces of nature
into useful work under the sea, on the sea, on land, in the air, and in space
beyond the earth's atmosphere.

Last month's problems were not quite
hard enough. Everyone must certainly
have figured them out. For instance, take
the first one. It was simple:
Of Man's first disobedience, and the
fruit
Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal
taste
Brought death into the world, and all
our woe
With loss of Eden, till one greater
Man
Restore us, and regain the blissful seat,
... I thence
Invoke thy aid to my adventurous song,
That with no middle flight intends to
soar
Above th' Aonian mount, while it pur-
sues
Things unattempted yet in prose or
rhyme.

In the case of the skaters, anyone
knows that a system which is not acted
upon by any external forces maintains the
same point as centroid at all time. Hence
as the skaters separate, the centroid is
still at the center of the pond. Of course
when the ball is thrown the centroid of
the system will rise when the ball rises,
and fall when the ball falls, but if no
external forces act on the system the
skaters must sink down through the ice
as the ball rises, and return upward as
the ball falls. But this would be a ridic-
ulous situation, hence we conclude, like
Newton, that we have discovered the
law of gravity. This too is an external
force and must therefore be neglected.
Hence everything will move on the same
straight line along which the original
force was exerted. Now you see what a
ridiculous problem this was in the first
place.
In the case of the checker player, the
king stands to lose a tidy sum. The orig-
inal $42,949,672.96 is 2 to the 32nd
power cents. Hence he stands to gain a
maximum of $85,899,345.91.
Now with last month's problems out of
the way we can go back another month
and give credit to those who submitted
correct answers to the chemistry problem.
Here are the names of all persons sub-
mitting correct solutions before the dead-
line:
. . . and it was such an easy problem,
too.
With the old stuff out of the way, here
is a problem in logic. A man met a friend
wearing a lieutenant's uniform. They
shook hands and greeted each other
warmly, not having seen one another
for several years. A small girl was with
his friend. The lieutenant, nodding in
her direction said, "After our last meet-
ing, I married someone you do not know,
and this girl is my daughter. She was
named after her mother."
"Oh really?" he replied, "then your
name is Jeannette." All right, how did
he know?
Here are a few more such problems.
Can a man marry his widow's sister?
What is the relation of a man to the
speaker if "That man's mother was my
mother's mother-in-law! But he had a ter-
rible fight with my father, and they still
don't speak." What is the smallest num-
ber of people present in a gathering of
one grandfather, one grandmother, two
fathers, two mothers, four children, three
grandchildren, two brothers, one sister,
three sons, one daughter, one father-in-
law, and one mother-in-law?
Here are three items which might have
been found in the classified section of
the newspaper. Who would have been the
writers of these ads?
FOR SALE—The Manderlay estate;
slightly damaged house. M. deWinter.
REWARD—For any information lead-
ing to the identity of my prospective
br/d^groom, recently arrived on swan-
driven boat. Elsa.
WANTED FOR MURDER—King of
Scotland. I am rightful heir to the throne.
—Malcolm.
Now try your luck at some simple
mathematics problems:
What does (i + V3)* equal?
Prove that a question is a negative
statement by evaluating a determinant.
Find a three digit number which will
not be nine when put through the fol-
lowing operations. Reverse the digits and
substract the smaller from the larger.
Now add these digits together to get a
new number. Do so once again. Now is
this number 9?
A box four inches on all sides is re-
cessed in the ground. Ten golf balls arc
putted at it several times at a distance ol
five feet. The probability of a ball going
in is forty chances in a hundred for each
ball as calculated from the experimental
result. If the four inch box is replaced
with a two inch box and ten balls putted
at it, what are the chances of each ball
going in? What are the chances of two
balls going in?
Three railway men named Smith, Rob-
inson, and Jones and three business men
with the same names live in New York
state. The businessman Robinson and the
brakeman live in Albany; the business-
man Jones and the fireman live in Syra-
cuse; the businessman Smith and the engi-
neer lives in Buffalo; the brakeman's
namesake earns $5,500 a year; the engi-
neer earns one-third of the business near-
est him. The railway man Smith beats the
fireman at billiards. Now name the engi-
neer.
For a final teaser what is the greatest
possible weight that can be measured by
four weights on a balance scale if the
weights are capable of weighing objects
at one ounce intervals?
For a final thought for the month,
ponder over this: If man were still "only
a little lower than the angels," it would
be high time for the angels to reform.

How to break records rolling plate
High steel plate production calls for high rolling
mill speeds. And this means friction must be re-
duced to the minimum, so that roll acceleration
will be easy. Low friction minimizes skidding and
scuffing between rolls to maintain gauge. Engineers
who designed this huge, continuous plate mill
met the problems by specifying Timken tapered
roller bearings for the work rolls and back-up
rolls. Result: The mill has set new production
records. Since their installation, Timken bearings
have rolled over 9 million tons of steel.
True rolling motion of
TIMKEN* bearings practically
eliminates friction-
o
All lines drawn coincident with the working sur-
faces of the rollers and races of Timken bearings
meet at a common point on the bearing axis. This
means Timken bearings are designed according
to geometrical law to have true rolling motion.
And they're manufactured with microscopic accu-
racy to live up to their design. Result: Timken
bearings virtually eliminate friction, give longer
bearing life, keep equipment rolling smoothly.

lems you'll face after graduation

was correct.
In 1771, a fire broke out in St. Peters-
burg in which Euler was lucky to escape
with his life, but his library and furni-
ture were burned.
Not to be discouraged in 1773, Euler
published his great works on the con-
struction and management of vessels. This
book was soon adopted by the French
into their schools of marine and Euler
was awarded 1000 rubles as its author.
About the same time an Italian, an Eng-
lishman, and a Russian translation ap-
peared for which he was awarded 2000
rubles.
Three of Euler's memoirs on the In-
equalities in the motion of the planets
were crowned by the French Academy
of Sciences; and he also gained the prizes
of 1770 and 1772 by his perfection of
the lunar theory.
On September 7, 1783 at the age of 79
Euler expired with an apoplectic stroke.
A criticism of his "Tentamen novae
theoriae musical" might well be applied
to most of Euler's works, "it contained
too much geometry for musicians, and
too much music for geometers."
Although almost all his theories and
works have been discarded now, Euler
must still be credited with the improve-
ments he made in calculus and the ad-
vances he made in mechanics. A few
of his equations are still used today as
his column formula or the equation
which is known as Euler's equation. It
must be remembered that he was a
mathematician and the existence of ont
of his equations today is just as much a
tribute to him as a painting or a statue
is to its artist.

A newcomer to the ranks of TECHNIC writers Fred Stegenga,
'57 Aero, is well qualified to write on "Automatic Flight Con-
trol." Having a natural interest in this field and hoping to work
in it when he graduates, Fred has been absorbing everything he
can about the subject. One summer working for Lear, Inc., an
automatic flight controls manufacturer and one for Douglas Air-
craft have given him an industrial background to add to his
Aero courses and outside reading on the subject. He is now
working at the supersonic wind tunnel half-time for the Engi-
neering Research Institute.
Active while attending Rockford High, Fred has continued his
activity here at Michigan as a member and officer of the Institute
of Aeronautical Sciences and a past member of the Choral Union.
signal where he is relative to the localizer
beam and the glide path.
Using this I.L.S. signal it is possible
to add an automatic landing device to the
autopilot. This device will automatically
interpret the radio signal and fly the
plane accordingly. In figure 4 we see a
typical approach made by an aircraft
using an automatic landing device. This
is of particular interest to the commercial
airline because then even if an airport is
"socked in" the plane can still land. In
figure 5 we see a plot of the postion of
the aircraft relative to direct alignment
with the runway versus distance from end
of the runway. Aero micro amperes corre-
sponds to direct alignment with the run-
way.
Automatic Dampers *
The extreme flight characteristics de-
manded of today's high-performance air-
craft have, generally speaking, necessitated
many design compromises in aircraft
structures. As a result, many aircraft arc
plagued with inherent dynamic instability
problems, which result in undesirable
oscillatory directional motion during
flight. Commonly known as "snaking"
and "Dutch roll." The "Snaring" motion
is a result of instability in the yaw axis
and the "Dutch Roll" motion is a result
of instability in the yaw and roll axes.
These motions become prevalent when
the airframe fails to provide sufficient

aerodynamic damping. As the dynamic
pressure, called "q", becomes small this
damping force becomes smaller and the
oscillations become more violent. The
dynamic pressure "q" is given by the fol-
lowing equation:
q = y2Pv&gt;
where e = the air density surrounding
the aircraft.
V = the aircraft velocity.
It can be seen that at high altitudes and/
or low velocities the aerodynamic damp-
ing will be a small value. This would
limit the altitude of an aircraft with a
certain top speed. By applying automatic
controls for damping, this "useful" alti-
tude can be increased.
The automatic damping equipment uses
the control surfaces of the aircraft to cor-
rect for any change in attitude due to
oscillations. For example, in the "snak-
ing" motion, by proper use of the rudder
it would be possible to make the plane fly
in a straight line.
A typical damper system would in-
clude a rate gyro, a controller amplifier,
and a servo drive. The rate gyro sends a
signal to the controller amplifier that is in
direct proportion to the rate of yaw (or
roll or pitch). A rate network then
provides the phase lead necessary to
compensate for the lag normal created by
the aircraft rudden and servo drive. The
signal is monitored by an integrating net-
work that shapes the response so as to
keep the range of the system within the
stable portion of the aircraft control
characteristics. The signal is then am-
plified to the voltage level that satisfies
the gain of the system. This signal then
drives the servo motor which moves the
control surfaces.
Many of the modern interceptor aircraft
such as the F-86, F-100, and F-104, have
stability augmentation. In the F-86
fighter, commonly known as the "Sabre-
Jet", the addition of a 5 pound yaw-
damper made it possible to save about
100 pounds of structural weight. Perhaps
in designing the vertical tail, it was made
as small as possible which in turn re-
duced drag and increased general per-
formance of the plane. This smaller tail,
however, reduced the stability of the yaw-
axis which resulted finally in the "snak-
ing" or "Dutch Roll" mode of oscillation.
The aero dynamicist at this point had a
choice of either increasing the tail surface
area to give the increased stability needed
or to use a stability augmentor like the
yaw damper. When looking at the prob-
lem from the point of view of weight it
would appear that there would be little
question as to the answer. But, again, it is
a compromise. If the yaw damper should
fail the aerodynamicist would still want
the plane to be flyable. All of the planes
mentioned previously will fly without
stability augmentation but it would be a
very real strain on the pilot. The F-10-1
"Starfighter" has stability augmentation
in all three axes.

And here's another one from down

at summer camp last summer one of the

on a bridge stating: "This bridge has
been destroyed by air attack." But to his

the bridge despite his orders. He sent his

The captain beamed. "Read it aloud."

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Industrial engineering is concerned with the design, improvement and installation of integrated systems
of men, materials and equipment. The industrial engineer needs specialized knowledge and skill in mathe-
matics, physical and social sciences as well as in the principles and methods of engineering.
The industrial engineer is primarily interested in the structure of business problems as an adviser to
major management. His main task is to establish an uninterrupted flow of production at the lowest cost pos-
sible. He may be called upon to prepare complete plans for management control systems. Or, through a
study of cost, quality, and quantity elements, he may be asked to evaluate existing systems against certain
standards. It will be his job to decide when corrective action should be taken as his study reveals ways in
which production is varying from the standards established. The extent to which such corrective action
should be taken is determined by an analysis of the human, the economic, and the mechanical elements of the
management control plan. The industrial engineer may be called upon to prepare several alternate plans as
resources used in the business vary in their availability.
There are many operating elements in the planning and control functions of management. The industrial
engineer may be asked to work out methods which will insure quality in the product; to evaluate wage rates
and production standards; to establish economical methods for the layout of processes and the handling of
materials; to determine inventory policies; to develop adequate production control plans for loading the plant
effectively; to devise adequate means of communication between management and the working force..
These are examples of the elements with which the industrial engineer must be concerned in over-all systems
design. Preparation for a career as an industrial engineer requires familiarity with the basic sciences, with
technical engineering, with business administration, and with the techniques of industrial engineering.
Because industrial engineering is primarily concerned with setting standards of performance, both for
people and machines, the engineer in this field must learn to work willingly and helpfully with other people.
Opportunities for employment are very widespread in industry, but the young graduate of the program in in-
dustrial engineering will usually start as a member of an engineering team, and will need the ability to
work harmoniously in a group.

operator turned the crank. The Vulcan is
externally powered by either electricity or
hydraulic fluid.
Development of the Vulcan Gun start-
ed in 1946 when engineers decided the
Gatling Gun principle of several rotating
barrels in a cluster would provide the
high rate-of-fire required. Further charac-
teristics of the Gatling Gun pointed to-
wards low operating temperatures, relia-
bility, better maintenance factors and a
significant saving in weight, so important
in airframe construction.
The T45, first of the Vulcan series,
was designed for caliber 60 ammunition.
At this time, it was also realized that a
gun was needed capable of firing 20
millimeter ammunition. Work was then
started which resulted in the T-171 series,
the present model "D" Vulcan gun.
According to its designers, the Vulcan
gun is simple to operate and maintain,
and can be field stripped and reassem-
bled in less than 30 minutes.
NEW NUCLIDES CHART
More than a hundred new forms of
chemical elements, which have been
identified in the past three years, are
shown on a chart just issued by the Gen-
eral Electric Company.
This is the fifth edition of the "Chart
of the Nuclides." In earlier versions it
has become a familiar wall decoration in
atomic and other laboratories; one that
the scientists frequently refer to as a ready
source of much useful information.
Physicists used to think that each ele-
ment, such as iron, gold, oxygen, sulfur,
etc., existed in only one form. However,
about 40 years ago they found that a
single element might be made of several
different kinds of atoms, which varied
slightly in weight.
Among the elements as they occur in
nature, tin has the record with ten
"isotopes," the name applied to such
atoms of the same element but of differ-
ent atomic weights. In addition, other
isotopes may be produced artifically by
exposing various elements to rays from
huge atom-smashers, or in an atomic re-
actor. A total of 23 tin isotopes are
known, 13 of them artificial productions.
The general term "nuclide" covers all
the isotopes of all the elements. The word
is derived from "nucleus," since it is the
nucleus or core of the atom that deter-
mines its fundamental properties.
The new chart shows 1,388 nuclides,
112 more than the last edition, issued in
1953. The first edition, distributed ir
1948, showed only about 750 nuclide,
of the 96 elements then known. There are
101 elements on the 1956 edition, includ-
ing the last three, einsteinium, fermium
and mendelevium, which appeared ii
the fourth edition.
Vulcan's tremendous destructive firepower is exhibited in night
firing tests. The brilliant ball of fire, looking like a small atomic
bomb, is from exploding gaasoine. Ricocheting tracer bullets
can also be observed on both sides and the top of the ex-
ploding gasoline.

Few areas of engineering or science offer greater
problems-or greater opportunity for achievement-than
inertial guidance. At Lockheed Missile Systems' Research
and Engineering Centers in Palo Alto and Sunnyvale,
engineers and scientists are performing advanced
work on all phases of inertial guidance and navigation.
New positions have been created for those possessing
backgrounds in mathematics, physics, electronics,
servomechanisms, flight controls, precision instrumentation
and computer design. Inquiries are invited from
those possessing strong interest in inertial guidance.
Positions are open in inertial guidance and virtually
every field of engineering and science related to

EDITOR
Editor's note: This letter was received in response to an in-
vitation to contribute to our anniversary issue sent to all the past
editors over the 75 year history of the TECHNIC. Mr. Arthur Stock,
editor of the 1921 TECHNIC, now operates his own small engi-
neering firm in Cleveland, and here presents his comments re-
garding employment opportunities for engineers in small com-
panies.
Several years ago, I interviewed eight graduating
engineers from one of the leading schools in the
rountry. Any one of these men would have been a
valuable and welcome addition to a small company.
But, in spite of all I told them about us, they were
more interested in joining large companies offering
what seemed to them very glamorous positions.
This attitude seems more prevalent now than ever.
Of course, there are good reasons for it. The big
companies offer a certain amount of name prestige.
They pay good starting salaries and offer plenty of
fringe benefits and security.
For certain individuals, these offers represent the
maximum in opportunity. The research man, for in-
stance, will have at his disposal an elaborate and
well-equipped laboratory in which to work. Any
man of outstanding ability will find plenty of scope
for his energy and initiative in a large company. For
other people, the politics and red tape of a giant
corporation soon dull the glamour. Many men start
with a big company after graduation, work for a few
years, lose interest, and eventually take a job with a
smaller company where their efforts and experience
are more appreciated and better rewarded. To my
mind, these men would have been farther ahead if
they had started with a smaller company at the be-
ginning.
It is impossible, without knowing the person in
question, to offer any specific advice on choosing a
future position. However, here are a few comments
in general and an outline of some of the opportuni-
ties which a small business can offer a graduating
engineer.
In the first place, you frequently get a chance to
do a greater variety of work because departments are
not as highly organized in the small company. You
may find yourself working on a sales problem one
day, a design problem the next. This variety of ex-
perience gives you a better idea of how your com-
pany is operated, what its aims are and how well
those aims are being achieved. In addition, you are
apt to feel more team spirit in a small company,
more willingness to share the load when things be-
gin to pile up.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of the small com-
pany is the lack of company politics. I have heard
that certain large companies distinguish the impor-
tance of their executives by the size of their offices.
The gradual accumulation of square footage through
the years may appeal to some people but, in most
small companies I know of, it is not the size of the
office but the size of the job that is done in it that
counts.
I don't want to give the impression that big busi-
ness is bad and small business is good. On the con-
trary, I think it is imperative that these industrial
giants continue to make their contributions to our
industrial progress. My point is that a man should
get some fun out of his work so he should pick the
size of company and the type of job that gives him
the maximum enjoyment and remuneration.
I would suggest to each member of the Class of
'57 that he take careful stock of his abilities and in-
terests. He should decide whether he is a big com-
pany man, a small company man or one of those
rare people who like to go it alone. Then he should
tackle his chosen job with all the energy he possesses.
That way he is bound to succeed and to be happy
in his success.
Very truly yours,
Arthur J. Stock

INERTIAL GUIDANCE
by BERT HILBURGER, '58E
i
Some day soon, a pilot may fly from New York
to Honolulu without once looking out of the
window or commuting with the ground.
The author wishes to express his
thanks to Herbert Winter, Sys-
tems Engineer of the Bell Aircraft
(Corporation, for his inspiration
jand information which have made
possible this article.

Sometime soon, within the next 18
months in fact, an 80 foot, 3-stage rocket
will surge skyward from its berth some-
where along the Florida coast. Its first
36 miles of flight will be straight up;
at this point it will gradually slope south-
east. Two hundred seventy-five miles off
the coast of Florida the first stage will
run out of fuel, quit firing and drop off
into the ocean. The second stage will take
over, propelling the vehicle along a
curved trajectory. Its speed will be about
13,400 fps. at burnout, probably some 140
miles above the earth. Just prior to drop
off, the third stage rocket will be given a
spinning motion like a rifle bullet so it
will stay on course even though the con-
trols section in the second rocket has been
dropped. The third will now push on to a
point above the Gold Coast of Africa
reaching the orbiting velocity of 18000
mph. before it will shove the satellite
ahead and spiral back to earth, burning
up like a meteor as it reaches the denser
atmosphere. This Project Vanguard
rocket, which is being developed under
the management of the office of Naval
Research, will be fired during the forth-
coming International Geophysical Year.
The navigational system which it will
use is extremely new. See Fig. 1. Un-
like systems which require radio or
radar tracking, the Vanguard guid-
ance reference system is entirely rocket-
borne. Heart of the controls system
are three highly-accurate gyroscopes that
will be calibrated to a "memorized"
heading reference in the three axes or
directions of flight—roll, pitch and yaw.
These instruments are electronic versions
of a centuries-old toy. Known as HIG
(hermetic integrating) gyros, they have
nearly 300 parts contrasted to 127 parts
in a ordinary watch and require bearings
alike to within 10 millionths of an inch.
(If you took a hair and split it into 400
parts, one part would be 10 millionths of
an inch wide.) (See Fig. 2.) Perform-
ance-wise it can measure the rate at which
a glacier melts, or motion 3000 times
slower than the hour hand on a watch. Its
response is so fast that the minute move-
ments of a second hand are snail-like by
comparison. If a boy with a sled could
slide down a one foot slope with the same
frictionless ease with which the HIG
operates, he could glide for some 1000
miles before coming to a stop. This
particular system devised by the Min-
neapolis-Honeywell Regulator Company is
merely a step toward the pure inertial
guidance systems which are yet some
number of years off.
Pilots today can employ three basically
independent types of aerial navigation:
Piloting, celestial, and dead-reckoning.
Piloting consists of following landmarks
and beacons to one's destination. "Beam-
riding" would also come under this classi-
fication. In celestial navigation, the pilot
takes readings of two or more stars, find-
ing his position much like a ship captain.
Dead reckoning is the type most often
employed by commercial and military
MARCH. 1957
»9


navigators. True course and ground speed
are plotted periodically on charts to tell
the pilot his approximate position and
ETA (estimating time of arrival). In-
ertial navigation is a special case of this
latter type.
Inertial type of guidance systems offer
several significant advantages. There are
no inherent altitude, latitude or range
limitations; prior reconaissance is not
necessary provided the location of the
destination is known; no extensive ground
facilities are required. Also, the system
is non-radiating, and therefore is not sub-
ject to detection or jamming in military
use. There is also one important disad-
vantage. Since no outside information is
used, the accuracy of the system depends
wholly upon the accuracy of its compon-
ents and initial errors. However, for-
tunately, many of these errors are of a
oscillatory nature, rather than continu-
ously increasing.
Since inertial navigation is closely akin
to dead reckoning, the geographic loca-
tion (latitude and longitude) of the start-
ing point and the destination must be
known and set into the ecjuipmcnt- For
obvious reasons, this type 0f guidance
cannot be employed against a moving
target, such as in an air to air missile.
Once the original data has been in-
serted and the system has been placed in
operation, it will provide the geographic
position of the aircraft, the track and
ground speed, direction and distance
to the destination, and the altitude of the
vehicle. Now, this is not to be confused
with automatic dead reckoning (DR)
computers which have been in operational
use for some time. These are dependent
upon a Doppler or some other type radar.
Of course, this latter will give rise to
radiation problems which are to be avoid-
ed in the new system.
The fundamental law upon which all
mechanics is based involves acceleration,
not velocity; Newton's Second Law states
that force is equal to the time-ratio of
change of momentum. This leads us to the
principle involved in inertial navigation.
The procedure is to measure the accelera-
tion of the aircraft, and then integrate
twice, the last figure of course being the
distance traveled. However, the actual
practice is rather more complicated. The
elements of the inertial system are (1)
accelerometers with double integrators,
(2) a gyroscopically stabilized platform.
(3) a clock, (4) a computer, and (V)
associated electronic equipment.
An accelerometer may simply consist
of a mass held by a spring. Since the force
on the mass is proportional to the accelera-
tion, and the distance which the spring
stretches in proportional to the force it
exerts, the displacement of this mass is
also directly proportional to the accelera-
tion. A spring-type accelerometer is not
used in inertial systems, however, be-
cause of inherent non-linearities in the
spring, namely, creep and hysteresis. The
most satisfactory type of accelerometer
for this purpose is a pendulum. The tan-
gent of the angle between the vertical
and the line of the pendulum is propor-
tional to the horizontal acceleration. For
large angles, however, vertical accelera-
tions will introduce appreciable errors
Therefore, it is desirable to keep the
angle as small as possible. This can rx
done by amplifying the output from the
pendulum pick-off and applying it to »
motor at the pendulum pivot. With i
large enough gain, the steady-state angk
may be made very small, indeed, ttso-l
Since motor current is proportional to the

motor torque, and the counter-torque of
the pendulum is proportional to the ac-
celeration, the current can be used as a
measure of acceleration. Two or three of
these accelerometers are employed to cease-
motion in the north-south direction, east-
west direction, and in some applications,
m the vertical direction. They must be
extremely accurate, errors being in the
range of one part in several hundred
thousand. Associated with, and often
times a part of the accelerometer, is an in-
tegrator for summing up the accelerations
as a function of time.
In order to insure that the accelero-
meters are not subject to undeterminable
components of gravity, they are mounted
on a stable element—a device set at some
predetermined spatial orientation which
will not change, irrespective of the head-
ing or altitude of the aircraft. This stable
element is actually a set of gyroscopes
placed in a frame which is gimbal-mount-
ed for 3 degrees of freedom relative to
the air frame.
The basic element of a gyro is a ro-
tating mass. This is usually the rotor of a

Reliability of Guided Missiles
Increased complexity in guided missiles has led
to the development of a new science. Among
the many problems involved is the one pre-
sented here on how accurately missiles can be
guided along a predetermined path.
At the beginning of the air age, air-
planes were little more than powered
kites. Pilots flew by the "seat of their
pants"—they had little need for the bat-
tery of instruments that surrounds their
modern day counterpart. As air service
expanded, all weather flying became com-
monplace. Airspeeds climbed higher and
higher each year until the old "seat of the
pants" method of flying gave way to
instrument flying.
The earliest instruments were plumb
bobs and water bubbles—hardly subject to
breakdown. The introduction of radio
into aircraft initiated a movement toward
beam flying, radio compasses, automatic
pilots, and ground controlled landings.
The progress of the airframe kept pace
with instrumentation. Regulation of the
powerplant became more and more diffi-
cult. Airframe innovations such as vari-
able incidence and variable sweep wings,
all flying tails, and boundary layer con-
trol brought about a need for additional
controls.
These developments have led us to the
aircraft of today: a maze of valves, elec-
tronic control circuits, servomechanisms,
and relays. Many new sciences have
sprung up in the course of this develop-
ment. One of these sciences, reliability, is
concerned with making the relays, valves,
and all of the other components of the
aircraft function as we want them to.
when we want them to.
The concept of reliability, although
relatively new to engineering, is one of
today's most important fields of research.
It has assumed a particularly vital role in
guided missile science.
A guided missile is a peculiar device
in that it must think for itself. From

Mathematics major, worked at Lockheed's Missile Systems Divi-
sion, where he gained experience upon which much of his article
is based. Don is also a member of Alpha Tau Omega and an

launch to strike it must perform those
tasks which are left to the pilot in con-
ventional aircraft, in addition to func-
tions which are necessary only in missiles.
A passing glance may lead one to believe
that there is little more for the guidance
and control system to do than move the
rudder or ailerons occasionally to cor-
rect for side gusts: a closer inspection,
however, reveals the immense complexity
of the system.
Functions which must be performed by
the missile "thinking machinery" in-
clude determination of the course to the
target, regulation of the powerplant, and
fuzing of the warhead. Only complex
electrical, mechanical, aand electrome-
chanical systems are capable of perform-
ing these tasks. It is this complexity that
is directly responsible for the reliability
problem.
In conventional aircraft only a dozen
or so components are vital; the pilot
may meet and correct for exigencies and
still carry out his assigned mission. Con-
trast the airplane to the guided missile
which will fail if one single part doesn't
function properly. The breakdown of a
sixty-five cent resistor could conceivably
result in the destruction of an entire city.
Thus the need for a reliability sci-
ence is evident. The missile which rates
high in task ability (i.e., the ability to hit
the target) will be useless unless it has an
equally high rating in reliability. 1
If this reliability problem is to be ap-
proached from a scientific viewpoint, an
exact definition is needed.
Reliability is not an ability, it is a prob-
ability. More specifically it is the prob-
ability that "a missile will function as
prescribed under a given set of environ-
mental conditions for a given length of
time." When evaluating the overall re-
liability of a missile, each one of the
ideas presented in this definition must be
considered. A missile that could operate
for the required time and finally hit the
target would be of no value if it could
not stand the acceleration at launch (or
any other service condition). But reli-
ability can be defined in still clearer terms.
From the mathematical point of view,
the prabability that the missile will be a
success is the product of the probabilities
of success of all the components;
POT.r.1.=(Pl)(P!)(Ps)(P4) • • • (P„)
Thus if we have two missile compon-
ents with probabilities of success P, and
P2, the probability that they will both
function during the same firing is their
product;
Pov.r,..=(Pl) (P2)
It is easier to see how this product rule-
affects overall reliability by considering a
hypothetical missile.
Suppose we have a missile with one
hundred components (each tube, resistor,
valve, etc., is a component). Assume that
each one of these components has a re-
liability of 99% (i.e., out of 100 com-
ponents, only 1 will fail). Now let us
apply the product rule. We find that the
overall reliability of the missile is;
(.99)100 = 365 or 35 5%
This means that out of every three mis-
siles fired, two will fail. Actually the
typical missile has about 1000 components
and 10 subassemblies, which (if we
assume the same component reliability)
would give a prohibitively low overall
reliability. Since the missile assemblies are
put together in series, the Poverln is al-
ways much lower than the P of the com-
ponents.
The development of the German V-2
rocket gives an idea of how difficult and
costly it is to obtain high reliability.
Preliminary experiments were begun on
the V-2 at Peenemunde, Germany in
1933. An extensive rocket test stand and
development center was built at a cost
of $500,000,000. The center employed
some 6000 people; over 2000 of which
were engineers and scientists.
The actual design work on the V-2 got
underway in 1940. The first flight, on
July 6, 1942, was somewhat of a failure.
After rising precisely three feet off the
ground, the rocket exploded, destroying
the test stand. Out of the first eighteen
rockets fired, two were successful, giving

What is the story be-
■
hind the battle forfcon-
trol of the airways?
by JANET GUTHRIE, '59 LSA
It has been eight months since a Trans
World Air Lines Super Constellation and
a United Air Lines DC-7 collided over
the Grand Canyon, claiming a total of
one hundred twenty-eight lives. The
disaster, unparalleled in the history of
civil aviation, focused the attention of
the world on a condition long known to
aviation circles—the inadequacy of the
present air traffic control system in view
of the speed, complexity, and intensity
of the traffic it must regulate. The lack of
sufficient funds and the internal strife
which have handicapped any attempts at
progress have suddenly become minor
items, compared with the tragedies which
might reasonably be expected to occur in
the future. There must be a swift and
comprehensive solution to the enormously
complex problem of controlling flight.
Radio aids to navigation, upon which
the current system is based, were never
part of any master plan. Like Topsy, they
just grew. This is reasonable, considering
that there was no real need for a master
plan until, say, ten years ago. The Low/
Medium Frequency four-course radio
ranges were the first type to be developed
and installed. They are still in operation
over most of the country, but are gradu-
ally being dismantled. They have been
succeeded by Very High Frequency Omni
Ranges combined with Distance Measur-
ing Equipment. At the present time, it
seems that this in turn will be supplanted
by Tactical Aerial Navigation, currently
in the development stage. Radar has re-
cently been added as a means of policing
and guidance. These four systems provide
the basis for the traffic control available
today.
There has been constant bickering
among the various branches of aviation
over the use of these facilities and of the
airspace which they cover. Roughly, civil
aviation and the military dispute the type
of radio to be used; private and business
pilot associations argue freedom of air-
space with the commercial and military
interests; and all constantly petition
Congress for money to expand the effici-
ciency of the aids which now exist. There
are good grounds for most of these quar-
rels.
Take first the matter of airspace free-
dom. Commercial and military authorities
have stated bluntly that the only way to
prevent collisions in the air is to install
blanket coverage of all airways, if not all
air. (Civil airways correspond to highways
in the sky, and certain restrictions are al-
ready placed upon flight within them.)
Private aviation feels that this would be
a restriction out of all reason upon pilots
who do not have the special skills or ex-
pensive equipment to operate under these
conditions. The Aircraft Owners' and
Pilots' Association, the main voice of
private flyers, has noted that if even half
of j(s members were rated for and at-
tempted such flight, present controls
t0U/(7/i t begin to handle them. The
sentiments of the two hundred eighty
thousand-odd student, private, and com-
mercial pilots now active in the United
States are that a system of positive con-
trol as currently envisioned by the mili-
tary would mean the end of flying as
they know it. And since few men are as
enthralled by and as enthusiastic about
flying as small aircraft pilots, they are
willing to use the extent of their power
to prevent it.
As an indication of the height of feel-
ing which has been reached, here is a
statement made by Representative Clair
Engle of California in connection with
last summer's crash:
"It is a common practice for airline
pilots to bury their heads in the cockpit
from the time they take off until the time
they get ready to land. Proficiency in
'flying on the gauges' is supposed to be a
mark of the highest professional com-
petence, and altogether too many airline
pilots disdain to look out the window.
As a consequence, we business and plea-
sure pilots fly around any major airport
at the risk of our necks. If we do not get
out of the way, we are apt to get run
over, because we can be absolutely certain
that the airline pilots will not be looking
out of the cockpit."
This is patent nonsense, as anyone
with any familiarity with airline opera-
tion, instrument flying, or the Civil Air
Regulations could affirm. But it shows
how far some members of private aviation
24
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


will go to protect themselves.
The airlines and the military are far
from silent on the subject. Men who fly
professionally fly most often, and see far
more of the daily hazards in the air. Pro-
fessional pilots had one comment for last
June's accident—"Well, so it's finally
happened." Most of them have been ex-
pecting some such occurrence for a long
time, and were surprised only that it did
not happen over a large and congested
metropolitan area. The latter was far
more probable, and would have resulted
in deaths on the ground as well as in the
air. Said one pilot, "It should be recog-
nized that the only reason we have not
been smearing airplanes all over the coun-
try is due to the fact that so far God has
been on our side."
A 1955 survey by the Air Transport
Association indicated that four near col-
lisions involving large commercial air-
craft occur every day in the United States.
Of these, at least one-fourth are within
one hundred feet of becoming disasters.
Far from being the results of poor visi-
bility under instrument weather condi-
tions, 65% occurred in broad daylight.
For 43% the horizontal visibility was
greater than fifteen miles. (Aircraft may
be operated under Visual Flight Rules
when the visibility is as low as one to
three miles, depending on the location of
the flight. A small craft in the path of a
600 mph jet has under these conditions
six seconds in which to take evasive ac-
tion, if he spots the jet at the moment it
becomes visible.) Sixty per cent of the
misses were in major terminal areas.
Knowing and experiencing these haz-
ards, airline pilots have repeatedly re-
quested a firmer and more inclusive sys-
tem of flight control. They maintain, with
considerable justification, that it is prac-
tically impossible for a pilot to keep a
proper watch from the instrument-
crowded cockpit of an airliner in a busy
area, when he has a score of other opera-
tions to perform simultaneously. He does
an amazing job of this, but his task
sometimes passes the limits of human ca-
pability. In addition, he must cope with
insufficient cockpit visibility. The pilot
of a Lockheed Consultation such as the
one which crashed enjoys less than two-
thirds of the range of vision of a 1953
Ford. From this limited area hi must
constantly watch for other aircraft which
close, under head-on approach conditions,
at a rate of speed faster than that of a
bullet fired from a Colt .45. Impossible?
No. Dangerous? Rathcr!*"*;*S:"^v':&gt;
In spite of all this, it must as ever be
emphasized that commercial flight is
about the safest means of transportation
there is—many times safer than the auto-
mobile. The publicity always accorded an
airline crash creates the misleading im-
pression that the traveler would be bet-
ter off on the ground—an idea complete-
ly incorrect.
The Air Force is under even less con-
straint to keep its traffic troubles to itself
than is commercial aviation. It does not
worry about frightening away revenue-
passengers, or about having the Civil
Aeronautics Association file violations of
the CAR against its pilots. It admits free-
ly that the crew of a B-47 must keep
its attention centered in the cockpit
seventy-five per cent of the time it is in
the air. It reports mid-air collisions have
occurred at the rate of seven a month
since 1952. The Strategic Air Command,
which has a traffic problem now, is de-
manding positive control for all traffic
above twenty-five thousand feet by the
time the commtri iai jets arrive.
A startling example of the impossi-
bility of safe visual flight control in these
jets was given in the July 1956 Atlantic
Monthly by H. G. Mosely. He cited the
case of the pilot of a jet bomber who
was cruising at 30,000 feet at eleven in
the morning on a clear day. He started
a shallow right turn and saw a flight of
three more bombers approaching on a
collision course about a mile away. Be-
fore he had time to act, he had flown
past the first, under the second, and over
the third, clipping the tail of the last
with his engine pod. He immediately re-
turned to the base, where he told what
had happened. The flight of bombers
was recalled to the field, and the pilot
learned that there had been not three, but
six in the formation, and that neither

any one of them had seen him fly through
their formation.
The private pilot, who does not resent
these bombers for their job, regards them
as so much flying dynamite. They are
fully capable of knocking a small plane
from the sky and never realizing it. An
instructor at my home field, after a par-
ticularly hairy brush with a B-47 at low
altitude on a training flight (there is a
new SAC base a few miles to the south)
said he was so close that "I could see that
the copilot was reading page twenty-eight
of Mad Magazine." And after a moment
of thought, "One of these days when I
don't come back from a flight, you can
assume that there is homogenized Piper
Cub spread all over the South Florida
area . . . which'll probably sprout next
spring."
These things give you an idea of some
of the difficulties to be resolved before a
general control system is applied to avi-
ation. Canada has initiated a possible
remedy, consisting of stringently con-
trolled flight over designated airways be-
tween the altitudes of 9,500 and 23,000
feet. However, it is generally estimated
that months to years of work would be
required before such a system could suc-
cessfully be installed here. And the me-
thod leaves unsolved the far worse prob-
lem of low-altitude traffic at terminal
areas.
What of the methods of navigation—
accuracy of which is essential to the suc-
cess of any control system—which ones
are and which ones may be used? The
oldest, most cumbersome, and least adapt-
able of the systems now in use is the
aural L/MF range. First installed many
years ago, it is slowly being replaced by
the so-called omni.
The VOR/DME system is entirely
visual. By rotating a dial until the needle
indicator of the receiver in the aircraft
centers, the pilot can read off the exact
direction to the station. The omni range's
simplicity has made it extremely popular,
and the CAA has invested millions in
its development and installation. It is
now in danger of being supplanted
(with great wailing and gnashing of
teeth by civil aviation) by Tacan, a sim-
ilar but incompatible system developed by
the Air Force. Tacan, or Tactical Aerial
Navigation, is in general more accurate
and harder for an enemy to monitor.
Originally satisfied with the omnirange,
the Air Force and Navy began research
on Tacan after certain military difficulties
and failings of the omnirange became ap-
parent. They are now thoroughly com-
mitted to the Tacan program and face-
some unpleasant alternatives with respect
to its use. From their standpoint, the best
idea is to convince Congress that Tacan
should be installed over the United States
as part of the civil system. Against this
there is weighty opposition from both
commercial and private groups. If they
fail, they can either set up Tacan by them-
selves, at a cost of some fifty million dol-
lars, or install both VOR and Tacan
receivers in its aircraft, for use, respec-
tively, in civil flight and long-range
foreign flights. The latter choice carries
the burden of complicated operation and
more weight in the airplane. The former
will still bring trouble with the civilians.
Tacan interferes with the DME portion
of VOR, as they both operate on the same
frequencies. The directional guidance
parts of the systems do not bother each
other.
It is known that Tacan still has bugs in
it. Furthermore, foreign nations have only
recently been persuaded to set up omni-
ranges of their own, and would take a dim
view of making comprehensive changes.
Private pilots, with receivers installed in a
large number of their planes, are not at
all amenable to the idea that their ex-
pensive equipment may become worthless.
VOR and DME are entirely separable.
VOR is used primarily for directional
guidance, although with a slight amount
of manipulation it can be made to give
information as to location. This is what
DME was designed to do, but it is far
more expensive and still very rare. The
airlines have been content to watch and
wait, looking perhaps to the widespread
use of radar for more accurate positional
reports with less trouble.
This brings us to a third aspect of air
traffic control, and one about which there
is very little disagreement—the use of
long-distance radar for surveillance and to
insure proper separation among aircraft,
over large areas of the United States. The
CAA has installed radar sets, mostly con-
verted military types, in a few areas across
the country; notably at Washington, D.C
It has been severely handicapped in its
requests for more by budget slashes from
the Budget Bureau and from Congress.
Shortly after last summer's crash, how-
ever, Congress for the first time granted
sufficient funds to enable the CAA to
work actively on its plan to modernize.
Canada is far ahead of us in the field
of radar. By the end of this year she will
be covering 50% of her major routes
with two hundred mile-radius radar sets.
The CAA has looked longingly at her
progress.
Since 1955 we have operated a short-
range set at the airport in Washington
Airline pilots are almost unanimous in
praising the smoothness which it has in-
corporated into traffic handling in the
area. When radar is generally applied,
aviation can expect fewer take-off and
landing delays and easier handling of lost
aircraft. It can help planes avoid areas
of heavy precipitation and turbulence. Its
limitations include snow and rain clutter,
occasional confusion of aircraft on the
scopes, and the lack of coverage right
down to the ground; but the benefits out
weigh the drawbacks.
The CAA eventually wants seventy sets.

TltQ . . .
CO-OP PROGRAM IN ENGINEERING
The cooperative educational program
allows a student to alternate periods of
school attendance with periods of em-
ployment in industry during which time
he applies the knowledge he has gained
in the classroom. Many students prefer
to obtain their education in this manner
because they are given the opportunity to
earn money to pay for their education
and, at the same time, to do work which
will supplement their college education.
There are also other advantages for a
student in a cooperative program. For ex-
ample, he has the opportunity to gain an
idea of practical engineering methods
first hand; he is able to participate in
shop work as well as work with profes-
sional engineers; he has the chance to
shop around and find out what field of
engineering appeals most to him. These
points will be discussed more fully after
the different types of programs have been
presented.
When a prospective cooperative stu-
dent is ready to enter college, he will
have his choice among a number of col-
leges which offer this type of program.
However, all schools offer, basically, the
same subject matter in each engineering
curriculum, be it mechanical, electrical or
one of the many other branches of en-
gineering. The manner in which the pro-
gram is organized, however, is the main
concern of the student.
First of all, there are some schools
which require a student to enroll for one
or two years study of engineering before
he is given a position with a firm. Some
schools which follow this plan are: The
University of Detroit, Illinois Institute of
Technology, University of Cincinnati, and
Cornell University. During the first two
years, these schools give the student a
basic knowledge of engineering so that
he will not be forced to take a menial
job. Also as a result of these two years
in school, he is in a much better position
to learn from his job experience.
Another difference in school programs
which the prospective student considers,
is the way the semesters are arranged.
Some schools such as: Bradley Univer-
sity, Northwestern University, and the
New York Institute of Applied Arts and
Sciences of Brooklyn have the student
attend school for thirteen weeks and then
work for thirteen weeks. Other colleges,
among which are: Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute, and Illinois Institute of Tech-
nology split the year by having the stu-
dent work for approximately six months
and then attend school for six months.
The thirteen week program and the half
year program are the most popular but
two month and one month programs exist
at some schools too. The General Motors
Institute offers a choice of one or two
month programs. The branch of the Uni-
versity of Michigan at Dearborn will offer
a program of three months school fol-
lowed by three months in industry.
SELECTING A SCHOOL
In selecting a cooperative school, the
student must consider not only the dif-
ferent time periods but also the different
engineering curricula that a college offers.
Schools offering aeronautical, chemical,
civil, electrical, industrial, mechanical,
and architectural engineering are listed
at the end of this article. The college
catalogs contain the necessary information
regarding cooperative programs and a
prospective student should study these to
be aware of the possibilities concerning
organization and types of programs.
After a student has completed the re-
quired work at his chosen school, he
will then have consultations with an ad-
visor to determine what type of work he
would like to start in. As a freshman he
will be able to decide whether he wants
to work as a draftsman, laboratory assist-
ant, or assistant to a project engineer, to
use a few examples. Upon making his
choice, the student goes to work and after
completing his employment period, he re-
turns to school and has another consulta-
tion with his advisor. He discusses what
he has accomplished and the advisor, who
usually receives reports from the firm
the student worked for, will tell him
where he was deficient and where he
was successful. A great deal is learned bv
talking over each job before and after the
student has worked at it.
Besides work experience, the student
will receive around $50.00 per week as
a starting salary. As he gains in experi-
ence and obtains more theoretical knowl-
edge in the classroom, his assignments in
industry gradually become more difheuk
and involve more responsibility. Naturally

his salary increases and many cooperative
students find that they are earning around

cooperative program, a student can re-
ceive a better job than a graduate who
did not have cooperative training. His
starting salary will be between $25.00
and $40.00 higher, per month, than that
of a regular four year student—but it
won't be higher than that of the four
year student who started school at the
same time and has already completed a
year of full-time work.
By careful selection of a school that
offers the type of program the student
desires, he can receive a very well-
rounded education while working to pay
for his tuition. In order that he may
graduate in five years, a cooperative stu-
dent is required to learn more in a
shorter length of time than a normal four
year student. To do this, he will have
to sacrifice time for extracurricular ac-
tivities such as varsity sports, school clubs,
or campus activities. However, the values
gained by participating in activities such
as learning how to work with people,
gaining experience in organization of
projects, and obtaining a sense of re-
sponsibility, are not to be ignored. Many
times, according to those who administer
cooperative programs, a student will gain
far more at his job than he would in
extracurricular activities.
A cooperative student will also find
that he matures quite rapidly when work-
ing in industry. A student will usually be
placed with a firm in a strange city and
will have to take care of himself in an
atmosphere less protective than that pro-
duced by most colleges. A student who is
in industry will also develop a mature
manner of working with many different
people. This is a very important trait that
should be developed in an engineer for
he is constantly working with other per-
sons throughout his professional career.
The cooperative student may start by
working in the shop where he will learn
the attitudes and point of view of the
indispensable craftsman. Since a profes-
sional engineer frequently has occasion to
work with the shop men, any familiarity
he possesses concerning their methods,
speed of work, and range of ability, will
be beneficial to him during the periods
when he is in contact with the shop.
The preceeding is just one example of
how the student learns to work with peo-
ple. Engineering developments are con-
stantly becoming more complex and re-
quire the combined efforts of many men.
Here, the ability that a cooperative stu-
dent acquired in learning how to work
with people and the realization of the
value of teamwork, are said to enable
him to fit into industry, upon graduation,
much more smoothly than a four year
student.
A very valuable opportunity available
to the cooperative student is the inside
view of the economic side of engineering
that he is able to receive. By working on
different projects, he finds that a product
must not only be functional but should
also be easy to manufacture, durable, and
appealing to the buyer. By being aware
of these desirable qualities, the student
will have a better understanding of in-
dustrial methods, and know what type of
product an engineer is expected to de-
velop.
The cooperative program has also been
found to be an excellent method by
which a student may find out if he ac-
tually likes working in the field of tech-
nology. He can analyze his fitness for
practical engineering and learn whether
the field he has tentatively chosen actually
holds the anticipated attraction. If a stu-
dent finds that he does not want to enter
a certain field, he can then change his
educational plans before time and effort
have been wasted. It is far better to enter
a field after graduation, confident that you
are going to be doing the type of work
you want to do, rather than to have to
make changes before becoming settled.
How does cooperative education com-
pare to summer work? Compared to sum-
mer work, a student can gain some ex-
perience during summers but it should
be remembered that he does not have an
advisor to discuss each phase of his work
with him. He also puts in less time and
does not have the opportunity to be ex-
posed to the many sides of engineering
practices. His experience, in other words,
is much more haphazard than the work
experience of the student in a cooperative

So 1/ou Think
Dts A/aw!
Ever since man began to move around
he has wanted some method to compare
his speed with the speed of others. In
early times foot races and horse races
provided a method for determining who
or which was the faster for a given dis-
tance. There was little care as to the actual
or average velocity. When a runner was
needed to deliver a message the fastest
man was chosen, and he covered the dis-
tance in as short a time as possible. When
journeying between towns a man could
guess, within a day or two, how long
it would take him to make the trip. In
the slow, easy going life of ancient times
this knowledge was sufficient.
In modern times, however, when min-
utes are important, a more accurate me-
thod of determining speed is necessary.
On land, speed isn't too difficult to com-
pute. By measuring the number of rev-
olutions a tire makes per unit of time
and knowing the radius of the wheel,
the linear velocity can be found. This is,
in effect, how a car speedometer works.
A slight inaccuracy of two or three miles
per hour can be introduced by adding
extra pounds of air pressure to the tire.
But this error is relatively meaningless to
the ordinary driver.
In measuring velocity on water we en-
counter a new problem: which velocity
should we use? Velocity relative to the
land is important to the traveler. He
wants to know how long it is going to
take him to get where he is going. But
another type of velocity is important to
the designers and engineers, velocity
through the medium. The engineer cares
Primeval Speedometer.
little how a strong current held a boat's
speed down several miles per hour, or
how an undertow carried a ship to a new
record. The engineer is more concerned
with what the ship would do without
these outside variables. He is then con-
cerned with the ship's speed relative to
the water.
This doesn't seem like such a great
problem, but how would you measure it?
Would you trail a log, with a spiral cut,
behind the boat and count the number of
twists per unit of time? The rope knot-
ting or the log snagging onto a rock
might give you trouble. Perhaps the il-
lustrated invention would be your choice.
GZ is a parallelepiped column. ZY is
cylindrical so that the whole column may
be turned around by the handle RL.
CBE is a metal rule fixed at center pin
B so as to be easily voluble in a vertical
plane. The diameter of the semicircle
ESN and the edge tm of the other arm
lie in a straight line which includes B.
ac is a line with a at the center of the
semicircle and the other end fastened to
Q (the wooden globe).
The nearer the center a can be brought
to the surface of the water the better the
results obtained. For this reason Y is
attached near a lower porthole. Q is then
heaved out and ac allowed to become
taut. The globe is resisted by a column
of water RTXV, whose base is equal to a
great circle of Q. The velocity of the
globe equals that of the ship which in
turn is equal in magnitude to the velocity
of the water which the anterior part of
the globe touches.
The line, being stretched by the water's
resistance, will pull down arm BE until
an equilibrium is reached between the
force of the resisting water and the
weight C at the other end of the rule.
Such an equilibrium once being obtained
C will be to the resistance of the water
as line BI is to BP (BI is perpendicular
to dp, BP is perpendicular to CP, and
CP is a vertical line passing through cen-
ter of gravity of C).
The ratio between BI and BP is given,
because angles «BI, Bap taken together
equal a right angle, and Sap and hap are
also complementary. Therefore angle
Sap equals angle aBl. Using simple trig.
BI can be computed. In a similar man-
ner, in the right triangle CBP, with the
given hypotenuse CB, and the observed
angle CPB, the sides BP can be figured
With the force known, and having
previously run test where the force was
measured in the same manner and the
velocity computed by other methods, the
present velocity could be computed by
setting up a ratio of force to velocity
This assumes that the boat is not acceler-
ating during these periods, which should
be relatively true.
This little gem of modern engineering
was actually invented in 1754 and de-
scribed in Gentleman's Magazine in Jan-
uary of the next year. It preceded the
log by close to a century. The log fu&gt;
since been replaced by a tube with a re-
volving wheel within. Did you think it &lt;
was something new?

It's an oxygen flash smelting furnace.
That means conservation of fuels,

In this new process, you separate
oxygen from the air. You blow this
oxygen—and fine copper sulfide concen-

The oxygen reacts with the concen-

heat. The ore smelts itself, eliminating
need of other fuels: copper collects in
the matte, iron and rock in the slag.
And the previously wasted furnace
gases? These sulfur-rich gases are col-

sulfur dioxide, up to 300 tons a day.
Oxygen flash smelting is another
advance in extractive metallurgy. It's
part of a continuing program to step up

In the Automotive Industry
The author illustrates the inner workings and
procedure followed in automotive research by
following a sample project run through the
complete research cycle.
The term "Research" is one which has
extremely wide usage and, correspond-
ingly, a large number of meanings. "Re-
search" can be extremely basic, delving
into the fundamentals of physics, chem-
istry, metallurgy, etc. "Research" in uni-
versities can also be basic in nature, but
in addition is often directed toward solv-
ing problems related more to everyday
living. And "Research" in some organiza-
tions can be another title for the actual
design of the end product.
In the automotive industry the term
"Engineering Research" seems to define a
middle ground of engineering activity
which is related to but different from
engineering which designs the end prod-
uct. Engineering Research is also dis-
tinguished by its objectives from the
research activities of the industry which
are concerned with the basic principles of
science, ideally with no thought toward
product application. In other words, the
basic function of Engineering Research
seems to be the development of new
product concepts which can be designed
into the end product for future produc-
tion. On this basis, the Engineering Re-
search activity can utilize the specialized
skills and knowledge available in the
scientific research activity. Most of the
time, however, the Engineering Research
activity is concerned with presenting prod-
ucts to the actual product engineering
groups.
To illustrate the role of Engineering
Research, I have picked a simple project
to describe, that of combustion chamber
development. I will not attempt to pre-
sent a technical paper describing such a
project, but will instead attempt to de-
scribe the method by which such a project
operates, with particular emphasis on the
facilities and sources available to the
engineer, and on the role of the engineer
in an Engineering Research activity.
At the start, a project is assigned to a
particular research engineer who acts es-
sentially as the chief engineer for the
project. This engineer defines the goals,
lays out the specific design, build and
test programs, and is responsible for
seeing that the project is carried to its
conclusion. He usually reports to a senior
research engineer who will be in charge
of a group of people working on projects
of the same general nature.
The first step in any research or de-
velopmental project is the definition of
the goal, or purpose of the project, within
those ground rules which will govern the
scope of the project. In the case of com-
bustion chamber design, certain engine
variables such as bore and stroke can be
arbitrarily established in accordance with
projected trends of future engine size.
Other variables such as valve and spark
plug location either remain as design
variables or may be fixed by the limita-
tions of available tooling, depending on
the extent of engine change contemplated.
A major variable to be determined is
compression ratio. Here we have the bene-
fit of test data developed both within
our own engineering staff and by the
group activities of the automotive and
petroleum industries. The Coordinating
Research Council coordinates work on
problems which are of mutual interest
to both the automobile and petroleum in-
dustries. Annual surveys of customer
cars evaluate the octane requirements and
fuel behavior in current production
models, providing background knowledge
on combustion chamber performance in
customer-owned cars. It is possible to plot
fuel antiknock quality and compression
ratio for past production, and by con-
tinuing conferences between the two
industries it is possible to estimate the
future paths of both antiknock quality and
compression ratio. With an analysis of all
pertinent data we are then able to estab-
lish our design goals for a combu&gt;tion
chamber design project in terms of the
compression ratio and fuel quality which
will be prevalent at the time such a
chamber might be released in production.
In further definition of the goal, the a
search engineer will define the perform
ance standards to be met by the com-
bustion chamber along with whatever de-
sign limitations he may recognize, in
terms of production adaptability and co»t.

£voLution oj} the So I at Styjtern
Just as the biologist seeks to show how all forms of life evolved,
so the cosmologist tries to learn how the many complex systems
in the universe, including our Solar System, came into being. This,
too, is a study of evolution; here is a description of one process
by which the Solar System might have evolved.
The most striking characteristic of the
universe other than the great space be-
tween objects, is the order with which
all the objects are related. Satellites re-
volve about the much larger planet in
regularly spaced almost circles. They
move in the plane of the planet's equa-
tor and in the same direction as the ro-
tation of the planet. In the solar system,
nearly the same thing is true on a larger
scale; and, in the galaxy, a hundred bil-
lion stars move in the same plane about a
great central concentration of giant stars.
Of course, there are many exceptions to
this order, but the exceptions stand out as
curiosities.
This order could not have come about
by pure chance; there must be forces
which made it come about. Since the be-
ginning, men have wondered at the order
of the heavens and tried to explain it.
In the eighteenth century, many men
considered the Solar System the result of
a colossal accident, the near collision of
the sun and another star. But, about thirty
years ago, men realized that the forma-
tion of double, triple, and multiple com-
binations of big and little stars is a
common process in the universe, and they
began to search for a natural process that
would produce a complex system like the
solar system. Men are still searching;
there is as yet no theory which can account
for all the phenomena observed in the
solar system, and perhaps there never will
be; cosmological theories are too big to
put in laboratories and examine.
But this won't stop us from guessing
how things might have come about, for
this is the natural way that knowledge is
accumulated: we postulate a relationship
between facts and test this relationship
empirically. We shall construct a theory
which seems reasonable aand possible to
us, one which makes the solar system the
result of a natural process, rather than a
one-out-of-ten-billion accident.
The story will begin a few billion
years ago with a body of gas moving
around in one of the "arms" of the Milky
Way Galaxy. There is not really much
to see, for there are only a few mole-
cules per cubic foot of space, and the
only light is that from stars which have
doubtless already formed in the center of
the galaxy. But don't think that nothing
is happening, for mathematicians [e.g.,
Sir Jeans] have shown that this body of
gas must be always changing. The par-
ticles attract each other through gravita-
tional force; but, more important, electro-
magnetic waves emitted by stars bombard
the gas particles from all directions—ex-
cept directions in which the molecule is
"shaded" by another molecule [see figure
No. 1.] Since the resultant forces on
both "shading" particles will be toward
each other, there will be an apparent at-
tracting force between small objects much
greater than gravitational attraction.
The body of gas was originally in cir-
cular motion due to its movement through
the galaxy, and it begins to spin much
faster as the molecules of gas begin to
fall toward each other.
Many million years later, when the
body of gas has shrunk to perhaps a
billionth of its original size, it will tend
to condense into a ball, But the particles
still possess their original angular mo-
mentum; and, since their orbits have be-
come relatively small, the particles which
began at the outside of the body of gas
have too great an angular velocity to fall
into a sphere. Because of this, the gas
forms an oblate spheroid, so extended as
to be almost a disc.
Now, two very important things hap-
pen. First, the gas molecules are so close
together that they can no longer move
40
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC

around in a circle smoothly. For, accord-
ing to Kepler's Laws, the inner particles
move faster around in a circle than the
outer ones, and there is friction between
each ring of gas and the rings of gas in-
side and outside of it.
It is like water flowing through a pipe.
In a given pipe, water will flow smoothly,
providing the flow through the pipe is
less than a certain amount. When the
flow increases above this amount, swirls,
eddies, and airpockets form; and the
current is uneven—in other words, there
is turbulence. The same with our rotat-
ing body of gas: according to laws of
probability formulated by von Weiz-
sacker, the gas begins to move in great
swirls—smaller swirls closer together in
the center and larger swirls farther apart
near the perimeter. Figure No. 2 shows
how these turbulence eddies probably
look.
But most of the gas has moved to the
center of the circle, and now it begins
to condense into a sphere. As it con-
denses, it's temperature must rise until it
reaches the temperature of the fusion of
hydrogen. And suddenly there in the
middle of that black, swirling mass of
gas—there is a light. Relatively rapidly it
grows brighter, and within a few million
years, the sun has increased to its bright-
est light.
Around the sun, the gas is still rotating
in spirals millions of miles across. But
this cannot go on forever, for the particles
are colliding and sticking together much
more often now. They are closer together,
which makes their gravitational attraction
much greater than before; besides, the
sun is now exerting radiation pressure
upon the particles. At the vortices of the
swirls, conditions are ideal for the ag-
gregation of particles. As particles fall
toward the center of the swirl, they again
form almost a disc, because of the an-
gular velocity of the outermost particles.
As soon as a large mass forms, it be-
gins to revolve about the sun, sweeping up
smaller particles in its path—in the same
manner as the earth will some day at-
tract meteors, only on a much larger scale.
And the same thing happens with the
planets as with the sun a larger central
spheroid condenses, with possibly smaller
spheres around it in a regular order.
Let us pause a moment, and see what
we have, for it is almost finished. Around
the sun move nine planetary bodies, with
satellites moving around most of them.
The sizes and orbits of the planets could
have been predicted quite closely by the
application of von Weizsacker's theories,
except that there is an apparent gap be-
tween the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Per-
haps a planet has been destroyed by the
tidal action of Jupiter, or perhaps no
planet ever formed. In place of the planet -
that-isn't, many small bodies, called as-
teroids, move in erratic orbits between
the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
The planets are sweeping the inter-
planetary space as they shall continue to
do until they have swept it clean. Some
of the larger particles meet the planet
at such an angle that they are not accel-
erated into the planet, but rather forced to
move around it in an elliptical orbit.
Thus, the outer, erratically moving satel-
lites of the larger planets are formed.
Like the sun, the planets become heated
as they condense. But they do not ex-
plode, for their mass is not great enough;
there is not sufficient pressure at the cen-
ters of the planets to cause the tempera-
ture to become high enough for hydrogen
to fuse into helium. Their heat simply
dissipates into space
Since the composition of all the known
universe including the sun, is about

Turbulence Eddies. According to von
Weiesaker's theory, this is how the gase-
ous nebula from which the Solar System
developed can be calculated to have

diameters of the "rings" of gas corre-

planets.
ninety-nine percent hydrogen and helium,
and about one percent all other elements,
we shall assume that the gas from which
the planets formed had about the same
composition. But the small gravitational
fields of the planets are not able to con-
tain the hydrogen and helium, which have
high thermal velocities [because of their
small mass] and, therefore, easily escape.
The large planets are able to retain part
of their hydrogen in compounds, but the
smaller planets lose all of their lighter
gases. Because the gas escapes in random
directions, most of its angular momentum
remains with the planet. Thus we observe
that while the planets contain only one
percent of the mass of the solar system,
they contain ninety-nine percent of its
angular momentum.
Now it is all over, except for minor
adjustments. The Solar System has prob-
ably passed through a gas cloud, for it has
acquired some comets [which, at the
rate they are dissipating, won't last very
long]. Apparently, Saturn's inner satellite
passed too close to the planet, and was
broken up by the planet's gravitational
field. The remains of the satellite now
travel in rings around Saturn.
As for the earth, it is still cooling, and
a hard crust is forming on the surface, as
the planet gets ready for life. Perhaps
the Solar System evolved in the manner
above described, or very possibly it did
not. With the pasage of time, increased
knowledge of the heavens will show
whether or not von Weizsacker's turbu-
lence theory—or even the whole concept
of a solar system evolved from a gaseous
nebula can explain all the phenomena
to be found in the Solar System. Mean-
while, new theories will be formulated
and old theories revised almost yearly;
for it seems quite important to astronom-
ers that they learn how the Solar System
was formed. If men can learn the process
by which this one relatively small and
simple system in which they find them-
selves was formed they will possibly have
gone a long way in learning how the
Universe came about, how it is chang-
ing, and what may happen to it.

The growth of electronic radiolocation
systems was given a tremendous impetus
by the outbreak of hostilities in World
War II. The acute need for a device
which could determine the range and
bearing of a target prompted development
of RADAR, while the problem of de-

often identical, electronic systems.-

return gives the bat an approximation
of the nearness of the object causing the
echo, and he changes his course to avoid
the object.
RADAR uses radio waves instead of
sound waves to effect this echo. RADAR
ranges are determined by emitting very
short electromagnetic waves and timing
the interval between emission of the sig-
nal and return of the echo. Since the speed
of the waves is known (speed of light)
the distance can be measured by convert-
ing the time interval directly to distance
and dividing by two to account for the
round trip. Since the time interval is so
extremely short (on the order of mil-
lionths of a second) it is apparent that
some better means of time measurement
than a stop watch is needed. This meas-
urement is accomplished by using a
cathode ray tube.
In the cathode ray tube a beam of
electrons is made to move radially at a
constant rate from the center of the tube
to its edge.4 At the instant of transmis-
sion the beam starts moving from the
center towards the edge. The beam is
suppressed until the echo returns, be-
comes amplified and is presented to the
scope. Then the beam is no longer sup-
pressed, and it strikes the coating on the
inside of the tube, causing a spot of light
to appear.'' The radius of the tube
along which the electron beam travels
can be scaled off to represent distance
directly, thus giving a visual presentation
of range.
If the electromagnetic waves can now
be directed, as in the beam of a spotlight,
and a directional antenna used, the bear-

of the object causing an echo may be
determined. The directional antenna and
the radius of the tube along which the
electron beam moves are slowly rotated
in exact synchronization. An echo re-
ceived by the antenna on any bearing
will then appear as a spot of light on the
tube at the same bearing. A fluorescent
screen is used on the cathode ray tube
so as to cause afterglow which lasts for at
least one complete revolution of the
aerial. Since the echoes remain visible
during this interval, a map-like presenta-
tion of the area appears on the screen.
RADAR has several advantages over
the other electronic systems, among them
being the fact that it can serve as an anti-
collision aid, in rescue work, weather
forecasting, and iceberg patrol. It fur-
nishes a continuous picture of the sur-
rounding area, can be used anywhere in
the world, and is entirely independent of
shore stations. Its greatest drawback is its
relatively short range—roughly limited to
the optical horizon from the height of the
antenna. RADAR must, however, be con-
sidered one of the most important mod-
ern navigational instruments.
Nearly everyone has used the principle
of the second fundamental type of elec-
tronic navigational instrument—the azi-
muthal type—when tuning in a portable
radio. The common observation is made
that the strength of the radio signals re-
ceived may be improved by picking the
radio up and rotating it until the best
signal is obtained. The signal is maximum
when the antenna presents its greatest
area to the transmitting station, and is a
minimum when the plane of the aerial is
at right angles to the direction of the
station. Radio Direction Finders, the
basic system using this principle, employ
sensitive loop antennas to determine the
Just a couple of years ago Michael Aughey was in first hand
contact with the various navigation systems which he has written

Engineering Dept. '59. Before that he had three years as a
Physics major at the University of Delaware near his hometown

directions of stations of known position.
Direction lines are then drawn on the
chart on reciprocal bearings back through
the known positions of the transmitting
stations. The intersection of two or more
such position lines determines the posi-
tion of the ship. In practice, the antenna
is rotated by the operator until a mini-
mum signal is obtained, since this signal
is more sharply defined. The station is
then 90° from the observed bearing, and
the line on the chart is drawn accordingly.
Radio Direction finders are fairly ac-
curate for short ranges, but the possible
error in position found by this method in-
creases rapidly with distance from the
transmitting station, since in general the
bearings of the station can only be de-
termined to within dzl^0. At a distance
of 300 miles from the station, an azi-
muthal error of ll/S° will result in an
error of nearly 8 miles in the line of
position.
LORAN, one of the most important of
the hyperbolic systems, requires special
shore transmitting stations of known loca-
tion. A pair of these stations are needed
to determine a single line of position,
thus at least four stations are required to
obtain a fix.
An hyperbola, it will be remembered
from geometry, is the locus of a point
which moves in such a way that the dif-
ference of its distances from two fixed
points is a constant.
The LORAN system uses this differen-
tial distance principle in the following
manner: The first of a pair of transmit-
ting stations, called the "Master", sends
out a pulse signal in all directions. After
a short interval of time this signal is
received by the second station, called the

ANNUAL REPORT
This summarized annual report of the Engineer-
ing Research Institute of the University of Michi-
gan describes the functions of the Institute and
some of the research accomplishments of 1955-
56.
... A Story of University Research.
Research is a very important factor in
the economic and social growth of our
nation and it is becoming even more im-
portant as attested by the fact that an in-
creasingly large amount of our gross
national product is .being spent for re-
search and development. Much of the re-
search is carried on in universities and
university connected research organiza-
tions, where highly trained staffs and
modern facilities of the research and edu-
cational programs are available for both
teaching and research. Much of this re-
search is supported by outside funds.
The university's primary function is
teaching, but teaching without research
would be futile indeed. The experience,
knowledge, and wisdom gained through
research are valuable assets to the teacher.
This is especially true in engineering
where new frontiers are continually being
discovered.
Research placed at universities is a
vital factor in the training of young engi-
neers and scientists. This is of special
significance in view of the unprecedented
shortage of technically trained men, which
probably will not be alleviated for some
time.
The University of Michigan agency re-
sponsible for the administration of spon-
sored research in engineering and other
associated fields is the Engineering Re-
search Institute, more commonly called
E.R.I.
This Institute is in the enviable posi-
tion of being able to obtain the coopera-
tion of the teaching and research staffs of
the entire University for its research pro-
grams. The Institute also has its own
sizable staff of highly trained personnel.
Some of the more important functions
of the Institute include bringing together
the best possible University research team.
The research is carried on by the Institute
under contractual agreements between the
Regents of the University and industrial
concerns, trade associations, individuals,
and the federal government as well as
those of state and municipal governments.
The Institute benefits industry. When
the Department of Engineering Research,
the predecessor of the Engineering Re-
search Institute, was established in 1920,
its purpose was to assist and promote in
all proper ways the success and prosper-
ity of most phases of industrial and tech-
nical work in the State. Since the Uni-
versity of Michigan is a state supported
institution, the emphasis was naturally
of service to industries in the State of
Michigan, but soon the Institute came to
serve industry on a country-wide basis.
Large industrial concerns which have
their own research laboratories frequent-
ly turn to a qualified university-connected
research organization such as the Engi-
neering Research Institute. The smaller
industries also are dependent largely on
outside research organizations for tech-
nological advances.
Many functions of the Engineering Re-
search Institute benefit the National Wel-
fare. Some of the federal agencies, nota-
bly the National Science Fundation and
the Atomic Energy Commission, are sup-
porting some Institute research for the
sole purpose of increasing our stockpile
of fundamental knowledge.
It also benefits the educational pro-
grams of the University. The research con-
ducted by the Institute is of benefit not
only to the sponsoring agencies, and
ultimately to every one of us, but also to
the educational programs. Thus the In-
stitute serves a dual purpose in conduc-
tion of sponsored research. It develops re-
search results and at the same time makes
important contributions to the Univer-

The Year's Record
The year's record of research funds
show that the total costs for research ad-
ministered by the Engineering Research
institute during the year 1955-56 were
$10,279,347, an increase of almost 20 per
cent over the previous year's figure. Re-
search supported by the federal govern-
ment again constituted the greater por-
tion, although industry supported work
showed a very gratifying increase of 68
per cent.
Project Michigan
Perhaps the most significant and im-
portant endeavor is Project Michigan, if
only because of the name. Project Michi-
gan, an armed services contract for the
improvement of battle-area surveillance
techniques, supports an extensive pro-
gram in system analysis and design. This
work has as its ultimate goal the pro-
vision of more complete collection, better
transmission and evaluation, and proper
dissemination of information from a

in the field of Materials Engineering
The development of more advanced,
far more powerful aircraft engines
depends to a high degree on the de-
velopment of new and improved
materials and methods of processing
them. Such materials and methods,
of course, are particularly important
in the nuclear field.
At Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, the
physical, metallurgical, chemical
and mechanical properties of each
new material are studied in minute
detail, compared with properties of
known materials, then carefully ana-
lyzed and evaluated according to
their potential usefulness in aircraft
engine application.
The nuclear physics of reactor
materials as well as penetration and
effects of radiation on matter are
important aspects of the nuclear re-
actor program now under way at
P &amp; W A. Stress analysis by strain
gage and X-ray diffraction is an-
other notable phase of investigation.
In the metallurgical field, mate-
rials work involves studies of corro-
sion resistance, high-temperature
mechanical and physical properties
of metals and alloys, and fabrication
techniques.
Mechanical-testing work delves
into design and supervision of test
equipment to evaluate fatigue, wear,
and elevated-temperature strength
of materials. It also involves deter-
mination of the influence of part
design on these properties.
In the field of chemistry, investi-
gations are made of fuels, high-tem-
perature lubricants, elastomeric
compounds, electro-chemical and or-
ganic coatings. Inorganic substances,
too, must be prepared and their
properties determined.
While materials engineering as-
signments, themselves, involve dif-
ferent types of engineering talent,
the field is only one of a broadly
diversified engineering program at
Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft. That
program — with other far-reaching
activities in the fields of mechanical
design, aerodynamics, combustion
and instrumentation — spells out a
gratifying future for many of to-
day's engineering students.
Engineer measures residual stress in a com-
pressor blade non-destructively, using X-ray
diffraction. Stress analysis plays important part
in developing advanced aircraft engine designs.
The important effects of gases on the properties of
metals have been increasingly recognized. Pratt &amp; Whitney
chemists are shown setting up apparatus to determine
gas content of materials such as titanium alloys.
P &amp; W A engineer uses air jet to vibrate
compressor blade at its natural frequency,
measuring amplitude with a cathetometer. Simi-
lar fatigue tests use electromagnetic excitation.

plan. The cooperative student is also
much better informed and has wider ex-
perience on which to build a career.
A cooperative student will also develop'
a greater enthusiasm for his schooling
than a summer student or a regular four
year student. The work he is doing is
closely connected with his school work
and so he has the important satisfaction
of applying what he has learned to prac-
tical use soon after learning it. He does
not suffer from the usual periods of bore-
dom in his school work which some stu-
dents feel after attending school for long
periods of time without breaks. By get-
ting out and doing engineering work,
the cooperative student is stimulated and
his appetite for school work is wetted and
his mind refreshed.
Viewing the entire program one finds
that many advantages exist over the
normal four year plan. Being exposed to
many engineering situations, the student
knows how to handle himself in indus-
try and has a keen insight into practical
engineering. He has had the opportunity
to carefully select the field he wants to
enter while working to pay his way
through school; and if he has been in a
first-rate cooperative program, he has
been able to combine the theoretical prin-
ciples gained in the classroom with prac-
tical application in industry. As a firm
pyramid needs a strong base of strongly
bonded components in order that the
peak may be achieved, so the engineering
student needs a broad foundation in
which the various phases of his education
have been carefully integrated so he can
reach the top in his field. The cooperative
educational system provides this founda-
tion.

The big day was here. The wonderful

YOUR STEEL NOTEBOOK
Steel thai lowered housing costs 26%
o
THIS part is a housing that must
accurately position the spindle of
a grinding machine that operates at
high speeds. Dimensional stability is
of prime importance. The manufac-
turer machined the part from bar stock.
That meant drilling the hole—a costly
step. Other factors raised costs even
more. The manufacturer couldn't main-
tain the precise tolerances required
and reduce production costs, too.
After studying the problem, Timken
Company metallurgists recommended
a switch from the bar stock previously
used to Timken' seamless steel tubing.
Immediate savings resulted. No drill-
ing was required—the hole was already
there. Scrap loss was reduced. More
parts were produced per ton of steel.
One of the annealing operations re-
quired with bar stock was eliminated.
Stress-relieving operations were
devised to insure complete stability of
the finished part.Tolerances were held.
And final reports showed that the
switch to Timken seamless steel tubing
cut production cost per housing 26%.

"Slave", which is located several hun-
dred miles from the Master. The receipt
of the pulse from the Master triggers the
transmission of the Slave pulse. This pulse
is purposely delayed at the Slave station
until a specific time has elapsed since the
transmission of the Master pulse. At the
end of this delay the Slave pulse is trans-
mitted. At this instant, on the ship, the
navigator has received the Master pulse
and is awaiting the arrival of the Slave
pulse. The pulse from the Slave arrives
shortly and is presented on a fluorescent
cathode ray tube, on which the afterglow
from the Master pulse remains. The dis-
tance between the two pulses as they ap-
pear on the screen of the scope repre-
sents the time interval between the re-
ceipt of the signals. By turning a few dials
on the LORAN receiver the navigator de-
termines this time difference and plots
it on a special chart. This type of chart
has a multitude of LORAN hyperbolae

printed on it in variously colored inks
corresponding to different pairs of sta-
tions. By obtaining time difference read-
ings for two or more pairs of stations, the
navigator determines his position.
LORAN, as the name implies, has the
greatest range of any of the systems dis-
cussed here. This range varies because of
changes in the ionic layers above the sur-
face of the earth when the day becomes
night and when the night becomes day.
The day time range is about 750 miles,
and at night is about 1400 miles. LORAN
is useful in obtaining the ship's position
when no celestial observations may be
taken because of foul weather, or for find-
ing the ship's position within a relatively
short time as compared to the time re-
quired to get a fix from sights of the sun,
stars and planets. An experienced operator
can determine his position within two or
three minutes, with an accuracy com-
parable to that of a good celestial fix.
The chief shortcomings of the system
are that the shipboard receiver is entirely
dependent on the proper functioning of
the shore stations, and that there is as
yet limited coverage in the world's ship-
ping lanes.
DECCA, an hyperbolic type widely
used in Europe, yields the same form of
position line with far less work on the
part of the navigator. In this system of
electronic navigation, a phase difference
in the two signals received from the shore
transmitting stations is used to determine
the hyperbola instead of the time dif-
ference used by LORAN.
The shore stations transmit continuous
waves, and the slave station synchronizes
its transmission with that of the master
station. In a receiving aerial at any point
Pt on the perpendicular bisecting MS
(Figure 5), two alternating voltages are
set up by the radiation from M and from
S. Since the distance P,M equals distance
P,S and the currents in the transmitting
areials are in phase, the two voltages set
up %\. P, are also in phase. "At a point a
small distance to the right of P,, the dis-
tance to M has increased, and that to S

SPOTLIGHTS
PROGRESS
Compiled by BERNIE MIGAS
The atom plays a big part in this
month's progress report, as it usually
does. A new reactor has been put on pub-
lic display, and science continues to find
more and better safety measures to keep
radiation under control.
The solutions to transportation and
production problems are also prominent
in the beam of the SPOTLIGHT, proving
that the atom has a long way to go before
it can claim push-button control over the
world's economy. We're still solving our
problems with a little bit of sweat.
Ice-Free Harbors through
Compressed Air
The 70-mile long and 33-mile wide-
Malar lake west of Stockholm is being
used as a guinea pig in an experiment
attempting to find a practical method of
keeping harbors and inland seas ice-free.
The principle is extremely simple: a
pipeline is put down on the bottom of the
lake running in the direction of the routes
which the ships follow. Compressed air,
forced through perforations in the pipe,
keeps the water above the freezing point.
The numerous factories that are on the
coasts of Malar lake regularly face great
difficulties in the winter. Supplying the
factories becomes very difficult as soon
as the ice paralyzes the shipping.
Complaints caused harbor authorities
to experiment with compressed air forced
through a perforated tube. The experi-
ments went so well that it is now planned
to cover the bottom of Malar lake with a
network of pipers.
At first 13 miles will be covered, and
along the whole waterway 9 compressor-
stations will be built. The construction
costs are estimated at $280,000, and the
yearly upkeep at approximately $42,000.
The industries which are located on
Malar lake have consented to undertake
the expense. In the course of a year the
costs would be made up by the savings on
extra railway freight in the winter.
The Swedish experiment is of signifi-
cance for all countries which have exten-
sive inland waterways. Already people
are considering the possibilities that
would result if they could keep the great
harbors of the Baltic sea, in which trade
with the neighboring countries is carried
on, free from ice.
Aircraft Metals Kept in Deep Freeze
to Safeguard Against 'Spoilage'
The freezer has become just as im-
portant to America's industry as it has
to milady's American household—and, for
precisely the same reason—protecting
perishables against spoilage.
Aircraft aluminum, prior to machining,
is as perishable in its own way as a mar-
ket basket of vegetables. Time is the
most important factor concerning aircraft
aluminum prior to its being machined and
shaped into airplane parts. If allowed to
remain in storage in its raw state for
more than four days, even at room tem-
perature, the metal becomes age-hardened
to a point where microscopic fractures oc-
cur during the forming process.
On arrival at the aircraft plant, to in-
sure that the aluminum remains in a
"fresh from the market" condition until
time for its use, it is first heated and
then stored immediately in a freezer at a
temperature of ten degrees below zero.
This process literally preserves the alum-
inum in a fresh and workable condition.
However, just as the housewife knows
perishables can only be preserved just so
long even in "deep freeze," this is true
also in the case of aluminum. If alum-
inum remains in cold storage beyond 30
days, age-hardening again takes its toll.
If it must b; stored beyond that time
limit, the aluminum is returned to the
manufacturer for remelting.
What is of even more importance in
the precise and careful handling of the
aluminum slated for one of America's
giant bombers is that once the metal is
removed from the freezer it must be
shaped within 15 minutes. Beyond that
time it loses its workability. Once shaped
on huge stretch hydor-presses, however,
the metal's "spoilage" is no longer a
factor. Age-hardening thereafter works
to the good of the airplane in that the
metal becomes more durable.
Solar Heat
The General Electric Company an-
nounced recently that the American home
of the future might be heated, cooled and
lighted by rooftop banks of solar bat-
teries.
It was pointed out that with the limited
fossil fuels—coal, oil and natural gas—
and even the limited uranium fuels, man
is turning to the sun, which, after all, is
actually a prodigious nuclear reactor pro-
ducing vast quantities of energy.
Th; sun pours onto the average house-
top in the United States more than a
hundred times as much energy as the
house receives via the electric power lines.

a reliability of about 11%. The Germans
finally attained a reliability of 80%, but
only after accepting very low accuracy.
After the war, the V-2's were shipped
to the United States. But even with Ger-
man technicians and engineers, the best
overall reliability attained was 47%.
Why was it such a difficult task to
make the V-2 a reliable weapon?
Again complexity is responsible. If we
simplify the system, performance is likely
to suffer. Then we must detect weak-
nesses in our necessarily complex system
and correct them. This is where another
difficulty peculiar to missiles is encoun-
tered.
The cause of the failures must be de-
termined before we can trace and correct
them. In most cases, the missile is not
recoverable; thus many test flights using
telemetering equipment are necessary to
gather sufficient data to achieve acceptable
reliability.
Once we have obtained statistical data
we may reduce the probability of failure
and increase the reliability in four ways:
1. Improve each component using sta-
tistical quality control, and more strict
inspection methods.
2. Improve the basic design of the
components. Fig. (1) shows the relative
importance of the various failure cate-
gories. As can be seen from this graph,
electrical failures are the most prevalent.
Missiles systems companies as well as
governmental research agencies are put-
ting special emphasis on the reliability
problem in electrical equipment.
Design weaknesses in all categories can
be traced to one or more of three causes:
(a) insufficient or inaccurate information
on environmental conditions, (b) varia-
tion in material strength from lot to lot,
(c) inadequate safety factors. Improve-
ment of the components can be effected
through redesign with these points in
mind.
3. Increase human reliability. Improve
the training of assembly and maintenance
personnel and revise ground handling
rules so that human errors are less likely
to occur. Note that this human reliability
element is not included in the product
rule. This rule gives a somewhat optimis-

tic overall reliability because it assumes
that no errors will be made in assembly,
maintenance, or ground handling.
4. Utilize the principle of component
redundancy.
A redundant system is one in which
two or more components performing the
same function are placed in parallel in
order that the operation of the system
may not be impaired by the failure of a
single component. Redundancy in con-
ventional aircraft is due to the presence
of the pilot.
The reliability of a redundant system is
easily calculated.
Suppose we have a system which has
several redundant parallel elements tied
directly together. Any one of the elements
can perform the desired function, and
failure of one element has no effect on
the other elements. Then if P, and Fj
represent the probabilities of success and
failure, respectively, for the elements, and
P„ and F„ represent the same probabilities
for the system;;
F3 = F,= . . .
=1 - (1-R,)»
Thus the addition of each parallel path
increases the Poverj„ . With Ps = 0.9, the
increase may be tabulated as follows;

This reliability problem constitutes as
much of an obstacle to the progress of
guided missile science as does the much
publicized thermal barrier. Continued re-
search in this field assures us, however,
that eventually near perfect reliability can
be attained.

Fig. 6. Rotation about the vertical caused by an
east-west acceleration.
in such a manner that external torques on
it are negligible. Since a large angular
momentum is desirable, the rotor is de-
signed to have a large amount of inertia,
and is driven at high speed. Due to the
conservation of angular momentum, the
axis of rotation will tend to remain sta-
tionary with respect to inertial space. But,
if a torque is applied to this rotor, the
gyro will precess about an axis normal to
both the spin vector and the torque vector.
Consider a gyro rotor mounted in two
gimbal rings, as shown schematically in
Fig. 3. Angle measuring instruments, such
.is potentrometers or synchros, are pro-
vided at gimbal axes to measure the angle
between the gyro spin axis and the case.
In addition, motors are provided at the
gimbal axes to apply torques to the gim-
bals and process the spin axis of the gyro
to any desired orientation. It is evident
that slight unbalances in the gimbals and
rotor will cause torques which precess
the spin axis. Called gyro drift, this is one
of the principle errors in an inertial sys-
tem.
In order to measure acceleration in the
desired direction, it is usually advantag-
eous to stabilize the accelerometers inde-
pendently of the vehicle, as mentioned
earlier. For instance, three degrees of
freedom may be obtained by mounting
gyros and accelerometers on a platform
which is connected to the vehicle by two
gimbals, as shown in Fig 4. The platform
is stabilized in space by 2 gyros which are
also mounted on the platform. Initially, it
is necessary to precess the gyro spin axes
to coincide with 2 axes of the desired
coordinate system, e.g., one gyro might
have the spin axes along the vertical, the
other horizontal in the north-south direc-
tion. The pick-off outputs of these gyros
is then applied to torque motors on the
platform gimbal axes until the platform
is aligned with the gyros. Of course, if
the earth were flat and non-rotating, it
would only be necessary to integrate the
output of the accelerometers twice to ob-
tain the distance traveled. (Incidentally,
the integrators used may be of a type
similar to those used in analog com-
putors.)
Let us now approximate the shape ot
the earth as a sphere, but still non
rotating. In order to keep the platform
level, we must rotate it at a velocity equal
to the angular velocity at which we travel
around the earth. This is equal to the
linear velocity (the output of the hrs:
integrator) divided by the earth's radius.
A signal proportional to this magnitude
is applied to the proper gyro torque
which, in turn rotates the platform. U
shown in Fig. 5. This torque motor acts
like an integrator, and is so indicated in
the diagram. The "output" of this torque
motor is the platform angle. If this angle
0y, is not equal to the true motion about

the earth f?y, the accelerometer will pick
up an error due to gravity equal to g sin
020y, where 20y= 0yc- 0y. For small
errors, this can be approximated by
g20y, and is so indicated in the diagram.
Looking at the diagram, we see that
it includes a closed loop of the second
order, and undamped, whose natural
frequency isVg R- This is the natural
frequency of a simple pendulum whose
length is the earth's radius. It is known
as a Schuler pendulum, after a German
professor of applied mechanics, who
published a paper on this subject in 1923.
Its period is about 84.4 minutes. The
angle between a pendulum and the verti-
cal is, in general, a function of the accele-
ration. However, it is intuitively obvious
that a pendulum whose length is the
radius of the earth, whose bob is, there-
fore, at the earth's center, will always be
vertical regardless of any acceleration.
The loop shown in Fig. 5 is equivalent
to such a pendulum.
There is another way of setting up a
Schuler loop. Let the platform remain in
its original position, as indicated in Fig.
6. After traveling a distance x along the
direction which is originally horizontal,
and which is found by twice integrating
the accelerometer output on such a plat-
form, the accelerometer picks up an
error equal to g sin 6y, as mentioned
before. But sin 6y = —. We can therefore
R
correct this error by feeding back a sig-
£X
nal proportional to ^- to the the accele-
rometer, as shown in Fig. 7. This is

known as "feedback control" and is the
essence of servo-mechanisms. This is
once again an undamped second-order
system, with a natural frequency of
y/g R, the Schuler pendulum frequency.
One fortunate result of the Schuler
loop is that many error sources, such as
steady gyro drift, platform misalignment
ot initial velocity error, produces errors
in computed position which oscillate at
the Schuler pendulum frequency, in-
stead of increasing continuously.
Now we can set up a complete inertial
navigation system. We will use a plat-
form like that shown in Fig. 4, and two
Schuler loops, one for each horizontal,
as shown in the same figure. Position will
be computed in terms of latitude L.
and longitude X. The coordinate system
is defined as follows:
x axis: horizontal east
y axis: horizontal north
z axis: vertical up.
The platform is aligned to keep the
accelerometers measuring along the x
and y axes.
You have already seen how the Schuler
loop keeps the platform level, having
disregarded the earth's rotation. It is,
however, also necessary to keep the plat-
form oriented north and east. The neces-
sary rotation about the vertical caused
by an east velocity is X' sin L, and a
signal of this magnitude is applied to
the azimuth gyro torque motor which,
of course, causes the platform to follow.
This is shown in Fig. 8.

now be added. The earth's rotation
vector 0 along the polar axis may be
resolved into a horizontal and a vertical
component. The horizontal component
is 12cos L along the y-axis. The vertical
component is SI sin L along the Z-axis.
These functions are instrumented as
shown in the schematic diagram in Fig. 8.
In addition, the earth's rotation causes
phantom accelerations due to the Coriolis
effect which must be cancelled by com-
putation. Perhaps a word of explanation
would be helpful. If the earth were not
rotating, a pilot flying a straight track
from the equator to the North Pole
would also fly a straight heading in space.
But since the earth is rotating an observer
in space looking down on the earth
would see that the airplane has really
flown a curved track in space in order to
make good the flight between the two
points. Figure 9 points this out quite
clearly. These corrections, which we'll
call Cx and Cy are computed as a function
of velocity and latitude and added to the
accelerometer signal. For the record,
they are:
Q= (X+2Q) Vy sin L, and
Cy=-(\'+2Q) V* sinL.
The system described is an example
of just one type of inertial system, one
based on the double integration of linear
acceleration. There are variations of this
particular system, and then there are the
so-called "hybrid" systems, which com-
bine inertial guidance with other con-
temporary navigation systems. These are
mostly interim designs which will be dis-
carded when inertial guidance is finally
perfected. However, until this day finally
arrives, we must depend upon these
hybrids to solve our complicated naviga-
tion problems.
The size of an automatic navigation
system is an important consideration of
today's aircraft designer. In the case of
inertial guidance, it is very difficult to
assign any particular size to the complete
outfit, since military security is very rigid
concerning this subject. It was originally
developed for use in long-range missiles
such as North America's Navaho and
large piloted aircraft. However, the Bell
Aircraft Corporation was recently awarded
a contract to design one of these systems
for use in short-haul helicopters. It would
only be a rough estimate to say that an
inertial system may weigh somewhere be-
tween 75 and 2000 pounds, depending
upon its applications.
The science of inertial guidance instru-
mentation has made significant advances
in the past several years. At the present
date, certainly, there is still much to be
learned, but with the present rate of prog-
ress, and with an increasing amount of
the nation's scientific effort going into in-
ertial developments, inertial navigation
will be a reality—very soon.

Efficiency is expected to be increased
enormously by the use of the radar trans-
ponder—a device which, when installed
in an aircraft, gives a coded reply to an
interogation sent out by the radar beacon.
Airline men consider this the most likely
answer to the range and identification
problems of radar use.
The last single problem affecting air
traffic control is that of renovating the
coordinating centers themselves. These
are the things most essential to proper and
safe traffic control, yet they are operating
under a system devised for use in the
days of the Ford Tri-Motor. There are
twenty-six of the centers in the United
States, some of them requiring forty or
fifty controllers. Each aircraft operating
under instrument flight rules must file a
flight plan here listing all information
pertinent to the flight. The flight plan is
filed on a slip of paper in a huge rack of
pigeonholes. The paper is passed from
box to box as the plane reports its prog-
ress. The antiquated method, found to be
"inefficient" by an advisory group eight
years ago, is handling some 2600 planes
in twenty-four hours, in peak areas. That
more mistakes do not occur is amazing.
The method demands a change.
What, in summary, is the answer to the
fearfully complex problem of handling
the 80,000 aircraft in the skies? It is not
a system which would require all planes
to operate 1FR, a true complete control
thing. This would indeed destroy a most
cherished facet of flight—its freedom.
Nor does it lie in mere observation and
warning systems. The ultimate plan will
undoubtedly substitute electronic comput-
ing and memory devices for much of the
work now done by man. It will probably
establish airlanes for the use of instrument
traffic only—three dimensional highways
in the sky. The dispute over radio will
probably be resolved by abandoning
DME, installing and perfecting Tacan.

(Continued from page 36)
The engineer now initiates the actual
design of the chamber or chambers which
he hopes will meet the requirements of
the goal which he has established. As he
has several design ideas in mind based on
past experience, he is then assigned design
help for the purpose of completing his
own rough layouts and detailing the
chamber for fabrication.
After obtaining approval of the design
details, the research engineer issues orders
to procure the parts necessary to build a
single-cylinder engine version of the new
combustion chamber designs. Most of the
parts can be fabricated within the com-
pany, with a few items purchased from
outside sources. As parts are received they
are checked against the blueprints by the
Maesuring Laboratory, which is fully
equipped to make complete dimensional
inspections.
After inspection the parts for the new
combustion chamber are delivered to the
Engine Build-up activity. This group is
responsible for the assembly of all experi-
mental test engines within Engineering
Research, under the close direction of the
research engineer.
At this point the engineer is now ready
to test his design and to start the evalua-
tion and continuing development. The
facilities of the Dynamometer Test Group
are at his disposal, and this group will
run all his tests under the engineer's
technical supervision.
In the initial phases of the study many
chambers can be screened by dynamometer
equipment utilizing more or less stand-
ardized instrumentation, since the prin-
ciple information required is concerned
with power, economy, octane require-
ment, and the engine rating of various
commercial fuels.
As the combustion chamber tests pro-
ceed, specialized instrumentation may be
required to study the combustion process
in greater detail. In such cases, the In-
strumentation Laboratory is available to
supply or build the required instruments.
In many cases, specialized instruments arc-
needed which are not commercially avail-
able, but must be developed by our in-
strument engineers.
Another facility of vital importance
to the research engineer in charge of the
combustion chamber study program is
90
the Fuels and Lubricants Group. The
fuels engineers will work with the re-
search engineer to supply the proper fuels
for the evaluation of the combustion
chambers under study. In fact, the fuels
group will be asked specifically to sup-
ply blends of fuel which are predicted
for production at the future date when
this combustion chamber design could
conceivably be released in production.
The program from this point on is one
of continuous testing, data analysis, and
evaluation. Even though most of the effort
in a project of this type is directed to-
ward obtaining test data, the work is only
beginning when data become available
from the dynamometer. At this point
careful data analysis and comparisons
with past combustion chamber perform-
ance are required in order that the com-
bustion chamber designs being studied
can be properly evaluated. In the nor-
mal course of events design changes are
indicated, and the chamber emerging
from this careful screening process may
in some respects bear little resemblance to
the original design.
After the screening tests on the single
cylinder engine have produced one or
more chambers which appear to have
good potential, these chambers are de-
signed into multi-cylinder engines for
full scale dynamometer and road testing.
There is always a difference between en-
gine performance on the dynamometer
and in a car in regard to octane require-
ment, and in the final analysis the per-
formance of the engine in the car is the
only measure of success.
Ultimately the research engineer will
arrive at one or more combustion cham-
ber designs which he feels merit consid-
eration for future production. The engi-
neer has fully evaluated these chambers
on single and multi-cylinder dynamo-
meters, and in several vehicle installations
under a variety of test conditions. In the
normal pattern of engineering compro-
mise the engineer must select that cham-
ber which has the most merit in regard to
the combined qualities of performance,
cost, and production adaptability.
The next step is the presentation of the
selected chamber to the Engineering Re-
search management who decide whether
the design merits presentation to the pro-

duction engineering engine design groups.
Assuming approval has been obtained, the
combustion chamber design is then pre-
sented to the engine design groups for
their consideration for use in future pro-
duction engines.
This attempt to define one type of
engineering research activity shows to
some degree the qualifications needed in
the successful engineer. First, good crea-
tive design ability is required to produce
the ideas and the designs to be evaluated.
Next, organizational ability is needed to
program the work and to fit in the activi-
ties of the many groups who will partici-
pate in the program. Good engineering
common sense is required to guide the
project through the problems and possible
failures of the test stages, where success
often lurks stubbornly just around the
corner.
Good judgment in analyzing data and
evaluating test results is of prime im-
portance in determining the remainder
of the program. Here again success can be
elusive, and must be tracked with pa-
tience, hard work, and persistence.
Finally, no results have any utility un-
less they can be communicated to tboit
who can use them. The ability to nuke
verbal presentations and write good re-
ports is essential if the engineer is to sell
himself and his product. In too many
cases the successful efforts of the engineer

Farming Forests
As Joyce Kilmer put it, "Only God
can make a tree," but we are not im-
modest in saying that now science can
make it grow better and faster.
This is the revolutionary concept of
silviculture: treating a tree as a crop
—for its cellulose content. Its purpose
is to make available more and cheaper
pulp and paper products.
Forestry has long been held back by
the concept that a tree will grow, if it
just has enough water. For years we
have practiced extractive forestry by
cutting down our natural, virgin for-
ests for wood products. When this area
is restocked, or when it is farmed and
then returned to the growing of trees,
the growth is inferior, because plant
foods — nitrogen, phosphorous, potas-
sium — have been lost from the soil.
The solution to this problem is sim-
ply putting food back into the soil, but
most foresters have felt that giving
trees nutrients is generally impractical.
To determine exactly how practical
it is to fertilize trees, Allied Chemical's
Nitrogen Division sponsored a five-
year study at North Carolina State
College. This pioneering work, just
being completed, indicates beneficial
effects of plant food on Loblolly pine.
Other recent studies have revealed
that fertilization produces a 40 to 65%
increase in tree growth, cutting years
off the growing cycle of pulp wood.
By speeding a tree's growing time, the
forester gets a faster turnover of capi-
tal and shortens the time the tree is
exposed to danger from fires or pests.
Growth is the most dramatic indi-
cator of forest fertilization. But there
are many more advantages: an increase
in sap and nut production, and in the
quality and quantity of seeds; a healthier
tree, better able to stave off fungus
and pest attacks; a better root system
and thicker foliage, making the tree
more efficient.
Aerial fertilization is an important
economy, for dusting planes can "feed"
hundreds of trees in a day.
What is believed to be the first aerial
application of a complete fertilizer to a
forest recently took place at Rutgers
University Dairy Research Farm at
Beemerville, N. J. The test, on an 11-
acre stand of red pine, was by Rutgers'
Forestry Department and Allied's
Nitrogen Division.
Fertilizers currently being used in
forest studies are Arcadian 12-12-12
—a balanced, granular (nitrogen-phos-
phorous-potash) combination, Arca-
dian Urka 45 — a high analysis, pel-
leted, 45% nitrogen fertilizer, and
Arcadian nitrogen solutions.
In conjunction with its field studies,
Nitrogen Division is also sponsoring
the first world-wide bibliography of
forest fertilization with a grant at the
College of Forestry of New York
University at Syracuse.
This definitive work contains over
600 references, and the important point
is that most of them relate studies
which show a favorable response to
forest fertilization. The Allied Chem-
ical-New York University bibliography
demonstrates that it is technically feas-
ible to fertilize our forests. The Allied
Chemical-North Carolina test demon-
strates that it is economically feasible.
Ascadian and Solvay are Allied Chemical trademarks
Chromyl Chloride
A new chromium chemical—with many
unique properties—has been developed
in a high grade of purity by Allied's
Mutual Chemical Division.
Chromyl chloride (CrO« Cb) is a
volatile liquid, characterized by its
cherry-red color, soluble in carbon
tetrachloride and similar solvents. In
undiluted form it is a strong oxidizing
and chlorinating agent, reacting so vig-
orously with many substances as to
cause ignition.
In suitable solvents, many controllable
and selective reactions may be carried
out between organic materials and
chromyl chloride. It is a starting mate-
rial for making chromium organic com-
pounds, some of which have unique and
useful properties as surface coatings
and bonding materials.
Until recently, the researcher need-
ing chromyl chloride was required to
prepare it himself. Mutual Chemical
has since put this interesting chemical
in pilot plant production.
Aluminum Chloride
We can only suggest the variety of uses
to which aluminum chloride (AlCb)
can he put. It is, for example, a cata-
lyst in chemical synthesis; it promotes
reactions in the production of dyestuffs
and intermediates, insecticides and
pharmaceuticals: most recently, it is
finding use for the first time in alumi-
num plating. i
The older and perhaps more often
thought of application is in the Friedel-
Crafts reaction. Solvay anhydrous
aluminum chloride is produced as a
high quality crystalline solid and is
shipped in a variety of granulations.
Creative Research
These examples of product de-
velopment work are illustrative
of some of Allied Chemical's
research activities and oppor-
tunities. Allied divisions offer
rewarding careers in many dif-
ferent areas of chemical research
and development.

decreased. Consequently the voltage will
no longer be in phase. The farther the
point moves to the right of P^ the greater
the phase difference will become. Finally,
the difference becomes 360°, which is the
same as 0°. At the point P2, which is a
wavelength farther from M than from S,
the two fields will again be in phase."'
An hyperbola can be drawn through
point P2, at any point on which the dis-
tance from M is one wave length farther
than from S. Similarly, hyperbolas can
be drawn through other points which are
2, 3, 4, etc. wavelengths farther from
M than from S.
The space between two adjacent hyper-
bolas with a phase difference of 0° is
called a lane. The whole area of Figure
5 can be divided into lanes.
Through a somewhat complicated elec-
tronic hookup, the phase difference is
shown directly on a dial on the ship,
as the ship changes position. As the
8 Sonnenberg—R &amp; EN. P. 143.
ship changes position, the phase dif-
ference and the dial reading change
correspondingly, thus a direct read-
ing from a pair of DECCA stations
is constantly available. In order to obtain
a fix, two or more stations are required.
The shipboard DECCA indicator has,
therefore, three phase difference dials,
each giving a continuous reading from a
different pair of transmitting stations. The
three pairs of stations are labeled the
"Red," "Green," and "Purple," and the
respective dials for each are similarly
labeled. A set of these stations constitutes
a "chain."
The problem of determining which
particular lane the vessel is in is solved
by a second dial in each of the other three
dials which counts the number of revolu-
tions made by the phase difference needle.
This dial is graduated into letters, which
identify the lanes. As the ship moves
from one lane into another, the phase dif-
ference needle swings all the way around
from 0° through 360°.
DECCA gives extremely accurate fixes
with great rapidity. Ship's positions may
be found within a matter of seconds with
this system. Its faults are like those of
LOR AN: dependency on shore stations
and insufficient quantities of transmitting
stations.
We have examined briefly the prin-
ciples involved in several of the basic
Electronic Navigational Systems. These
systems, marvelous though they may
seem, are only crude beginnings of the
systems yet to come. The scientists will
continue to develop faster, more versa-
tile, and more accurate equipment and
will no doubt finally reach the ultimate
goal—the perfection of self-navigation
equipment. When this point is reached
collision at sea or grounding of a vessel
will be nearly impossible since the major
cause of such accidents—human error—
will have been removed.

the class reconvened, the professor read

were required to count to ten before
pulling the ripcord, the hookline which
now automatically opens the chute not yet
having been invented.
One of my mates was proud of being
in the paratroops and was eagerly look-
ing forward to his first jump; but on the
big day he got those first-jump horrors.
He got to the door and turned to the
sergeant: "H-h-h-how h-h-h-high d-did
yy-y-yy-you s-say t-tk c-c-c-count?" he
stuttered.
"You count to three!" the sergeant said
shoving him out.

The ME instructor held the chisel
against the rusted bolt. He looked at the
ME student and said, "When I nod my
head you hit it."
They're burying him at noon today.
The story is told of a ChE professor
who arrived at one of his classes on a
particular day, left his hat and depart-
ed to chat with a colleague.
His students arrived for the class hour
but, after waiting the customary ten min-
utes, left. When the professor returned
to find his class gone, he was highly
irritated and gave them a stern lecture the
next period, concluding: "If my hat's
here, I'm as good as here."
When the professor arrived for the
next class meeting, there was nary a
student present, but a hat had been
neatly placed on each seat.
When I was but a little lad
Upon my Mother's knee
She used to ask me, "Son of mine—
What will you one day be?
And I, with my slide rule in my hand—
The toy I loved so dear—
Wound answer, "Mamma, you will
know
I'll be an engineer!"
While other little boys my age
Were reading fairy tales,
I'd bug my little eyes out
Over books of logs and scales.
The formulae they stuffed me
Was not sweet mild and meal—
I'd eat quotations X times Y—
How good they make me feel!
And so it was that pi to me
Was nothing that I ate.
I knew it equaled three one four
So I'd leave it on my plate.
The calculus and algebra
Became my bone and point.
What difference did it really make
If my head came to a point?
Then as it is in every life
A kindred soul I spied—
I wooed her with exponents
And with fractions she replied.
Her eyes were complex variables.
Her figure hyperbolic,
Her lips were hysteresis loops
Her smile was quite symbolic.
Our wedding was a joining
Of two mathematical wizards
We knew all calculations
From Alpha to the izzards.
Yet with all this wealth of knowledge
No matter how we try,
The operation we do best
Is just to multiply!
"Do you neck?"
That's my business."
"Ah, at last ... a professional."

GROWTH IN FACILITIES
NEW ENGINEERING CENTER i: being built with growth in
mind. Initially lorgt enough for o forte of 700 engineers, It ii
designed to permit rapid expansion of any functional oroa
without disturbing work in progress.
Growth — in plant facilities, for example, tells the Temco success story.
New buildings — like the completely modern 100,000-square-foot engi-
neering center opening this spring at Temco's Garland plant — clearly
tell the Temco story of widening engineering skills, increasing contracts
and significant advances in Temco's own projects.
At the beginning — back in 1945 — 550,000 square feet were sufficient.
Now, eleven years later, with three integrated Texas plants at Dallas,
Garland and Greenville, Temco has a total of 1,900,000 square feet for
administration, design and production — plus eight runways and an
immense total ramp area.
Completely modern facilities are only a part of the Temco story of
outstanding engineering opportunities. The challenge of meeting the
complex needs of the jet-age aircraft industry, plus advanced work in
Temco's own developments in electronics, aircraft and complete weapon
systems means that rewarding careers are open to you now at Temco.

duct* temperatures as high as 7,000 de-
grees Fahrenheit for metallurgical studies
in the quest of alloys of unusual prop-
erties.
A solar reflector 33 feet in diameter
could be used as a steam generator to
produce as much as 100 pounds of steam
per hour at 100 pounds per square inch
pressure.
Housetop solar batteries were described
as flat-plate collectors consisting of one
or more layers of glass placed over some
good solar-energy absorbing materials,
with a space between them. The collector
is generally a stationary device set at an
angle to best receive the sunshine. Air,
water or some other fluid is pumped
through the space between the heat ab-
sorber and the glass cover.
The heat absorbing panels also serve
as the roof itself. The heated fluid is
then used to warm the house, or it can be
used to drive some form of heat engine to
pump water or perform some other work
like cooling the house in summer.
Scientists and engineers have been
fascinated by the idea of making collec-
tors with cheap, "unfabricated" materials
such as water or living organisms.
S-E Turbostarter
A new propellant developed by Stand-
ard Oil of Indiana is being tested with the
self-contained starters made by General
Electric Company's Aircraft Accessory
Turbine Department in Lynn, Massachu-
setts.
In a test two engines were started at
the same time. One engine started burned
the old type of propellant that emits a
considerable amount of smoke while the
other engine was equipped with the new
and improved "smokeless" propellant
which eliminates practically all of the
smoke.
Called the AS-12 Turbostarter, the
unit weighs only 60 pounds and will
start and assist jet engines to idling
speed within 25 seconds. The ground
crew inserts a standard cartridge into the
starter located in the engine bulletnose
and the pilot merely presses a button
when ready to start.
With this lightweight system, planes
can operate from the most rudimentary air
bases even when no ground support is
available. At any base, instantaneous
group take-offs are now possible without
waiting for ground power—allowing the
planes to be dispersed for maximum pro-
tection against air attack.
First Engine X-Ray
A General Electric-Detroit Arsenal en-
gineering team has achieved the near-in-
credible feat of making motion pictures
of the innards of an engine while it is
running.
The job involves taking X-ray pictures
of the spinning, throbbing internal move-
ments of the engine through its steel
housing, and visually "stopping" with a
camera their high-speed motion.
The new technique, called stroboradio-
graphy, could have a significant effect on
engineering design. Slow-motion X-ray
movies and still pictures of pistons, cams
and other moving parts have enabled engi-
neers to scrutinize, for the first time,
complete cycles of engine operation for
faulty performance or wear.
The revolutionary process gives design-
ers their first glimpse inside a completed
machine operating at normal speed under
load conditions. Improved, lightweght de-
signs, and perhaps important basic design
changes could result from the X-ray mo-
tion studies.
The special Stroboradiographic equip-
ment was developed by the General Elec-
tric Company for use with its high-energy
industrial X-ray betatron, operating at 5
million to 15 million volts. The com-
pany's General Engineering Laboratory in
Schenectady, N. Y., developed the equip-
ment in co-operation with Detroit Arsenal
and the General Electric X-ray Depart-
ment in Milwaukee.
Engineers in the Materials Laboratory
of the Detroit Arsenal, Center Line,
Mich., have been continuing the studies
and this month came up with some of
the most advanced stroboradiographs yet
taken.
Unlike conventional X-ray equipment,
the betatron furnishes the surging radia-
tion pulses—416 per second—that have
given engineers this unprecedented "in-
side" view of any deflections, vibrations
or bouncings inside a running machine.
Previously, single-shot exposures of
moving objects had been made with low-
energy equipment, but the quality of the
radiographs suffered when the object was
composed of heavy parts of varying thick-
ness.
The new process involves taking thous-
ands of short exposures accurately syn-
chronized with the moving part. With an
exposure time of 10 to 15 millionths of a
second, it is possible to radiograph an
engine turning at several thousand revo-
lutions a minute.
Atomic Reactor on Display
Visitors to the International Atomic
Exposition and 1957 Nuclear Congress
were able to walk around and inspect a
critical nuclear reactor in actual operation
in Philadelphia's Convention Hall from
March 11th to 15th.
Now in quantity production at Aerojet-
General Nucleonics, the reactor has been
approved by the Atomic Energy Commis-
sion as completely safe for public exhibi-
tion without special shielding.
Developing a normal output of 100
milliwatts with a peak of 3 watts, the
reactor, which includes a remote control
console, is designed for use in hospitals,
educational institutions and industry' for
production of radio-active isotopes. All
shielding required has been built into the
reactor so that it is completely self-con-
tained.
The reactor is about 9J/2 f^ high and
looks a bit like a giant upside-down milk-
can. Weight is 22,000 lbs. The enriched
U-235 uranium is in the form of a
powder dispersed in solid polyethylene
plastic.
This will be the first time that an actual
"critical" reactor has been on public ex-
hibit except for the U.S. reactor in
Geneva, Switzerland. At the previous
International Atomic Exposition in Cleve-
land a pickle-barrel type of reactor was
on display but that unit was non-critical
and thus unable to maintain fission with-
out the presence of a separate neutron
producing source.
The Aerojet reactor, except for size, is
similar in principle to some of the giant
power-producing installations planned in
various parts of the U. S. and abroad. Its
66I/2 lbs. of fuel is estimated to have a
useful life of around 300 years.

of Navy aircraft.
The New FJ-4—Navy's latest and fastest Fury Jet—is the most
recent achievement at Columbus. Other, even more advanced designs
are now being developed from initial concept to actual flight...creating
top opportunities for virtually all types of graduate engineers.

lurgy in particular, a research project on
heat resistant alloys has been sponsored
by the National Advisory Committee for
Aeronautics since 1941. The purpose of
the project is to obtain basic information
useful for future developments in air-
craft propulsion systems, especially turbo-
jet engines. The initial research was main-
ly the study of alloy composition and now
research is in progress concerning melt-
ing conditions of alloys. Metallurgists
have long been unable to understand the
wide range of properties of alloys at high
temperatures even when composition and
melting practice have been well controll-
ed. In jet-engine operation, the turbine
blades are often subjected to extremely
high temperatures. These studies are be-
ing extended with particular emphasis on
the metal structure considerations con-
trolling the type of response to over heat
conditions.
In mechanics the post buckling strength
of plates, shells and other elastic bodies
is being studied. A structure or machine
is normally considered unsafe if it is
subjected to excessive stresses, which
causes "buckling." Actually, the full
reservoir of strength is rarely exhausted at
the instant of buckling. The purpose of
the present contract is to conduct a broad
investigation into the postbuckling char-
acteristics of elastic bodies.
Along the lines of nuclear energy, the
basic nuclear studies are being developed.
Using the University's 42 inch cyclotron,
a group of physicists are studying the
structure of complex nuclei. Deuterons, the
nuclei of heavy-hydrogen atoms consist-
ing of one proton and one neutron, are
fired by the cyclotron at a target contain-
ing the nuclei to be studied.
In the field of acoustics, acoustics of
motor vehicles has been studied. The
sounds emitted by motor vehicles are due
mainly to fuel combustion, cooling fans,
gears, wind passing over surfaces of the
vehicles, and the movement of other mis-
cellaneous parts.
While studying heat transfer with por-
ous surfaces the flow of hot air through
a porous surface has been used to prevent
ice formation on aircraft. This method
has also been used in reverse to cool the
walls of the combustion chamber of jet
engines, cold air, or fuel being forced
through a porous liner.
In meteorology, two Upper Atmos-
phere Research groups have been prob-
ing the atmosphere up to a height of
one hundred miles since 1946. The one
group is concerned with the instrumen-
tation involved and the other group with
the collection of samples.
Of course, research in other fields, likc-
machinability, chemistry, mathematics,
combustion, geophysics, and human engi-
neering, is constantly being developed
as part of the research carried on at the
University of Michigan Engineering Re-
search Institute.

Optical techniques applied to the study of gas flow phenomena has been an almost indispensible ex-
perimental tool to the aeronautical engineer. In addition to the more common 'shadowgraph" and
"schlieren" methods used for visualization of flow phenomena in which density gradients are present (such
as in shock waves and boundary layers), the Mach-Zehnder interferometer, embodying the principle of
light interference, is continually gaining more importance.
In the illustration, an 8-inch Mach-Zehnder interferometer is being used at the Aircraft Propulsion Lab-
oratory, North Campus for the study of aerodynamic flow phenomena occurring in a cascade of turbine
blades. The light colored area the investigator is inspecting is the image of a stage of turbine blading.
Photographs are taken of the light interference pattern appearing on the screen and from these pictures
the density throughout the complete flow field can be computed.
Experiments such as these have contributed to the improved design of supersonic aircraft and missiles
by continually providing a better understanding of the complex flow phenomena occurring as the air
passes over the aircraft or missile. In addition, they have contributed to the ever improving performance
of the jet-engines that power these aircraft and missiles by providing a more clear understanding of the
flow processes occurring as the air passes internally through the compressor, burner, and turbine of the
engine.

can be lost in an engineering activity be-
cause of the inability of the engineer to
express himself well and to convey his
ideas to his supervisor. The engineer
supplies periodic progress reports to man-
agement to enable their continuing guid-
ance of the project, and the ability to sell
the results in a verbal presentation is
certainly an aid to any sales campaign.
Products must be sold, and the product
concepts developed in an Engineering Re-
search activity must be presented and sold
to all prospective users.
In order to maintain a supply of engi-
neers to conduct this type of research ac-
tivity, the automobile industry has estab-
lished various types of training programs
for the graduate engineer. These train-
ing programs are designed to bridge the
gap between theoretical college training
and practical engineering in the automo-
tive industry. In our own Engineering
Research, the college graduate trainee is
assigned work in various laboratories per-
taining to that particular field of automo-
tive engineering which he chooses on
entering the company. He then works
with the engineer of each group in a
particular activity such as engine, chassis,
materials, and at the end of his training
period is fitted into that phase of the ac-
tivity in which he seems to have the
greatest interest and the greatest potential.
This program thus provides each activity
with graduate engineers who are well ac-
quainted with the facilities at their dis-
posal and who understand the problems
involved in development engineering.
What I have tried to show by the use
of one example is that the development
of a production component involves sev-
eral types of engineering, touching upon
the study of basic phenomena (combus-
tion) but more closely concerned with
product development (combustion cham-
ber design). In this respect, Engineering
Research offers a wider field of engineer-
ing in comparison with the product engi-
neering groups or the basic scientific re-
search groups, whose activities are more
limited in scope. Engineering Research
in the automotive industry is a challeng-
ing field and should be of interest to any
college engineer seeking a broad outlet
for his creative and productive energies.

speaks from experience when he says:
"There's
plenty of chance
for advancement
at U. S. Steel for
the man who
really wants to
get ahead."
If Kenneth a. brown were to speak
to you face to face, he would
tell you: "Hi fellows . . . I'm not
much older than you ... I still like
a lot of the same things you do. In
addition, I like my work and I sin-
cerely believe that you will like your
work at United States Steel, and like
the fine bunch of fellows with whom
you will come in contact."
Mr. Brown, at the comparatively
young age of 29, is presently Works
Engineer in charge of all engineer-
ing for the Worcester Works of the
American Steel &amp; Wire Division. He
graduated from Brown University in
1946 with a B.S. degree in Engineer-
ing. He first joined U. S. Steel as a
Junior Engineer at the Worcester
Works, Worcester, Mass. Although
his original duties included much
drafting, he acquired a general ad-
ministrative background and engi-
neering experience. This qualified
him for promotion to Assistant to the
Works Engineer in May, 1950. De-
spite a tour of military service for
two years, Mr. Brown's development
resulted in his being transferred to
the Construction Division in the
Cleveland General Office. Starting
January 1, 1953, he worked out of
this office as Chief of Party on vari-
ous construction projects.
On June 1, 1955, Mr. Brown re-
turned to engineering and main-
tenance assignments at the Duluth
Works. Although his work was pri-
marily concerned with engineering
problems, he also acquired a knowl-
edge of various phases of mainte-
nance. This experience qualified him
for promotion to the position of Divi-
sion Engineer on April 1, 1956. On
January 1, 1957, Mr. Brown re-
turned to the Worcester Works in his
present capacity of Works Engineer.
Mr. Brown's "success story" is
typical of that of many graduate
engineers who have associated them-
selves with U. S. Steel. "The unlim-
ited opportunities at U. S. Steel,"
says Mr. Brown, "plus the fine and
helpful spirit that exists among the
personnel, make success a matter of
one's willingness to work to learn
and to fit into the friendly atmos-
phere which exists here."

Recently the Technic was congratulated for something closely akin to
blindly ignoring progress. This, particularly in its 75th anniversary year, would
certainly not seem a reason for the magazine's long liveity and good health.
However, it is entirely possible that such is the case.
The compliment given the Technic was for the generality of the articles
we offer—and to the effect that we—and I would include most college engi-
neering magazines—are among the few technical publications which still print
news and articles of general engineering interest and do not gear themselves
to any one sector of the engineering world. This policy directly opposes that of
the masses of technical publications. More and more of these technical journals
are limiting their scope to fine points in their field and fail to carry material of
interest or value about the field in general. In addition, a number of new publi-
cations are riding in on the wake of this trend—from the very beginning of
their existence, highly specialized and of limited reader interest.
Actually, the origin of this trend lies not in the publishers' offices, but
with the engineers. We, too, are tending more and more toward limited, spec-
ialized training and work. The real point at question is the value of such
limitation. We are, ideally, dedicated to using the theories and formulas of
the pure sciences in producing realities for the good of mankind, yet how
much do we know about the world beyond the horizons of our silde rules
and handbooks?
It seems ridiculous to aassume that we intend to become mechanics or
technicians, but it would seem our work would be far more valuable and wisely
directed if we would consciously avoid placing limits so narrow on our thoughts
that we forget "how the other half lives."

TECHNIC STORY
Ambrose McHigan, the personification of the
Technic, returns to life to recall his memories of
the activities and growth of the oldest engineer-
ing college magazine in America.
Ann Arbor's foremost attrac-
tion, the University of Michi-
gan in 1953.
After many months of having the staff
delve into the dusty and mildewed ar-
chives of the Technic office, the following
history of our modest beginnings has been
compiled by Ambrose McHigan. (Am-
brose currently holds the distinction of
being "Michigan's most-semester senior"
and the Technic's oldest staff member.)
The first year of life for the Technic
was 1882 although it wasn't known as
such in those days. Its name then, 75
engineering students of the University
with an opportunity to discuss topics per-
taining to their profession. Professors and
alumni addressed the organization and
prepared papers for the Society's weekly
meetings. Thus, the Technic was only one
facet of this organization's activities—the
organ through which the addresses and
papers could reach a more expansive au-
dience. The Engineering Society as such
has long since disappeared; the Technic
The Technic had its offices in the old engineering building until 1922.
years ago, was "Selected Papers Read Be-
fore the Engineering Society of the Uni-
versity of Michigan." The Engineering
Society was an undergraduate profession-
al organization (the father of the profes-
sional societies of today such as ASME)
formed for the purpose of presenting the
has survived and still flourishes as the
oldest Engineering College Magazine in
America.
The first volume, appearing in June,
1883, contained papers which had been

Since the I840's, progress has been apparent on the campus at U-M.
published in this issue were Mortimer E.
Coolcy (later to become Dean of Engi-
neering), two alumni, and a student '83.
In 1887 the publication was formally
given the name of the Technic. Photo-
graph; and drawings were introduced.
(Prior to 1887 the only illustration had
been an advertisement for an hydraulic
pump.) Alumni and faculty continued to
submit articles, while the students began
to take a greater interest in the Society
and its popular organ.
During the Technics first years, the
staff had no faculty supervision and the
staff, or board as it was then called, had
to personally pay for any losses incurred.
Thus, much of the staff's time was devot-
ed to procuring a sufficient amount of ad-
vertising to cover their operating ex-
penses. Few half-tone illustrations were
used due to their tremendous cost and
illustrations were primarily graphs, charts,
and tables. Each issue did, however, fea-
ture a full page photograph of a faculty
member or famous alumnus as the frontis-
piece.
Until about the turn of the century, the
Engineering College was still a part of the
Literary Arts Department and so the
Technic was a student activity of the Lit-
erary Department. The staff then consist-
ed of only five or six seniors. At one time
two men, the Business Manager and the
Managing Editor, turned out an entire
year's volume by themselves.
The first pictorial front cover and edi-
torials appeared in 1889 and this same
cover was used on each annual edition for
several subsequent years. In 1891 the first
Engineering Society Banquet was held
and today is continued in the form of the
annual Technic Banquet which in 1957
was held on March 17. In 1901 and
during the following two years, the life of
the Technic hung in the balance. The
year 1904-'05 was the first in which the
Technic closed its books with a surplus
balance in the treasury, but it was also
the last time for almost another decade
that the year ended without some sort of
deficit.
It was about this time, too, that the
character of the magazine was altered con-
siderably. Papers published during the
early years had been of a highly technical,
text-book type. They had concerned
mathematical, civil, mechanical, electrical,
chemical, and metallurgical topics. The
magazine sold for 50£ and some 1500
copies of each edition had been printed.
In an attempt to reduce the Technic's ex-
penditure on red ink it was decided to
make it into a news magazine as well as
a "textbook." It was also decided to pub-
lish it on a semi-annual basis. With an eye
toward increasing circulation, departments
were added to the magazine whose sole
purposes were to satisfy this demand for
news. These departments later developed
into the features of "Engineering Notes"
(today's "Technic Spotlights Progress")'
"Alumni Notes," and "College Notes."
In 1910-11 the Technic for the first
time was presented to the public four
times a year. However, this accomplish-
ment came a year after the Engineering
Society had decided to place the publication
on a quarterly basis. Thus we see that
deadlines were hard to meet then as they
are today. Only in those days when they
were missed, they were missed but
good—by a year!
The perpetual headache which hung
over the heads of the staffs from about
1906 through 1918 was the standing debt
that had been incurred along the way and
which at times became a very serious mat-
ter. But little by little the financial situa-
tion improved and the debt gradually de-

creased. At one point on the way up, the
finances were temporarily in such good
shape that the staff was even considering
the purchase of a second hand typewriter.
(Our office now boasts two typewriters
and we are considering the purchase of a
third.)
In 1911, Dean Cooley arranged for the
Technic to have its own separate quarters.
This was in the Old Engineering Building
which long since has left the face of the
University's campus. Three years later the
staff moved to the rooms of the Engineer-
ing Society in the New Engineering Build-
ing (West Engineering Annex) where it
essentially remained until 1955 when the
Technic moved into its present quarters in
the East Engineering Building. Dean
Cooley also appointed the staff's first Fac-
ulty Committee which aided greatly in the
editing and publishing of the magazine.

In 1913 the off-campus circulation was
about a thousand and was composed most-
ly of alumni. That year the Technic ap-
peared monthly but in 1914 it was back
to four issues a year. 1914 also marked
the appearance of the first "Alumni
Notes," a feature that has been included
almost continually ever since—at least dur-
ing those periods when circulation drives
are being conducted. What was later to
evolve into "Censored by McHigan" ap-
peared first around 1915 as a feature en-
titled "Spicey Slices" and later as "Transi-
tory Slants." By this time advertisements
had increased to about twenty-five pages,
and the debt was all but completely paid
off. The staff was rapidly growing and by
1917 twenty students were engaged in the
entertaining work of writing, editing, ac-
quiring advertisements for, and circulat-
ing the Technic. The Technic was the
official publication of the College of Engi-
neering alone up until the early 20's when
it became a combined effort of the Col-
leges of Engineering and of Architecture.

up to the present time will appear in the
October issue.)

Reprinted from the 1911 Technic
"If we could be sure they were safe!"
How many sympathetic people have
listened kindly to the aerial propagandist,
as he expounds the advantages and joys
of the third mode of transportation as
represented by the aeroplane, only to
quench the fire of his enthusiasm with the
disheartening half-question. On this point
the aforesaid exponent of travel via the
therefore, incontestable proof of the con-
tention that aircraft can be made one
hundred per cent safe.
At the outset we cannot refrain from a
chagrined admission that the solution of
the problem has come from men appar-
ently unacquainted with the aeronautical
field, in fact, even outside the engineer-
ing profession. The only probable ex-
starry blue may quote mortality by the
mile or hurl aeronautical theory by the
gross ton, but he can neither bind nor
smother that still small voice.
Maybe the conversion of these kindly
people is of no importance to the aero-
nautical world. Certainly it has devotees
enough: in fact it is somewhat hampered
at times by their numbers and enthusiasm.
On general missionary principles, how-
ever, it does desire to do so. We present,
planation seems to be that an altruistic
desire to end the war has stimulated their
genius in perfecting aircraft to the point
of great accomplishment.
Proceeding to the matter in hand we
would like to call attention first to a very
novel type of aerial creation called the
Fly-plane (Fig. X.—We use the latter
end of the alphabet as it is yet unknown
whether or not they will fly). Here we
have, according to a description in one
of the popular magazines, a very compau
or condensed form of airplane, for it
measures but twelve feet span and ten
feet length. The condensed fuselage takes
the form of a straight-jacket which, with
its attached wings, fits the pilot very com-
fortably. The walls are hollow to contain
the fuel and oil necessary to the operation
of the condensed motor. This motor, a
gnome, vest-pocket edition, operates a
condensed propeller, the apparent func-
tion of which is to cool the pilot when
the fight is hottest. At least, if it were
intended to produce a useful thrust it
would be located so that entire blast
would not be deflected by the jacket.
Launching and landing this graceful
craft is of course a simple matter. Bulky
landing gear is replaced by fleet and
graceful human pedal extremities. To dart
into space the pilot has only to start the
powerful motor, run at listing speed,
and hard up the helm. Now it is claimed
that these craft can fly at a maximum
speed of 100 miles per hour. From the
very nature of an aeroplane, not exclud-
ing condensed goods, the landing speed
must then be 35 to 50. This will make
this type of aircraft very popular with
track men. We were going to predict that
as vehicles for social calls, the Fly-plane
would be ideal for society ladies, but
on second thought suggests that prior to
that time must come a modification of the
speed in the former or of running gear in
the latter.
There is no mention made as to the
material from which the Fly-plane is
made. Some one has suggested that from
the character of the name it must be fly-
paper. It is further recommended that
when the craft is produced in quantity, as

plane, and the miracle applications of electricity were first conceived, initiated, developed, and
finally evolved into what their modern counterparts are today. This progress and growth of
engineering has been the keynote of the thousands of articles that have appeared on the pages
of 75 years of Technics.
The attitude of the people has changed during this growth. Initially it was seriously pessi-
mistic of the potentials of these engineering masterpieces. This pessimism was often accompanied
by much ridicule, satire, and subtle sarcasm. There were many articles in past Technics which
reflected these feelings. There were even humorous articles written that satarized the pessimism.
This period was abbreviated by the technical growth which perfected the developments and
made them safer.
The following is an article that was found in the 1917 Technic which typifies this period. We
thought it would be rather interesting to reproduce the article in its entirety. Especially note the
attitude that prevails throughout the article. Realize also that this article was written during the
First World War at a time when the airplane was first being used as a tactical offense weapon.
its originator claims it will be, its trade
name be "L'Avion a l'Ange."
Turning from this type of fighting
plane, we may, for the sake of contrast,
well direct our attention to the giant of-
fensive weapon of Fig. Y. What could be
more desirable than a huge boat-shape
helicopter which could rise from the
water without a rapid forward speed,
dart to the enemy's lines, hover over
them and with some uncanny means, as
the canned lightning here shown, utterly
destroy the whole of it? Why not indeed
provide large roomy decks, where the
crew may move about with ease and com-
fort, operating the heavy siege guns, and
discharging the five tons of bombs car-
ried? Nothing prevents, according to the
inventor, a siege gun expert.
A few queries about the apparatus as
here represented, demand attention. Why
should the blast from the lifting pro-
pellers be deflected horizontally by the
decks, thereby giving zero useful lift?
Or why again put the lightning tanks
perpendicular to the direction of mo-
tion, when by placing them longitudinally
the resistance offered to forward motion
could be reduced three or four times?
If, however, we forget foolish questions
of this character, we are prepared to ad-
mit that here we have the potentialities
for putting an early end to the war.
Speaking of a speedy termination of
the horrible European (now European
and American) struggle, we are impelled
to glance at Fig. Z where in perspective
sketch is shown the idea which emanated
from the brain of a college Professor of
Greek and Ancient History. No, we do
not have here twin progeny of the old

Fig. X. Since the landing speed is about 50 mph, this type of machine will
doubtless be very popular with track men.

Growth of the Automobile
by BARRY PEEBLES, '60E
Without a doubt the automobile is one
of the major developments of our decade
and also a big reason for our very high
standard of living. Through the years,
from the first days of the Henry Ford
era until the free piston and gas turbine
of today, The Michigan Technic has re-
ported and interpreted the ever changing
scene of the automotive world.
On this, the 75th anniversary of the
Technic, the editors thought it would be
a good idea to review the progress of the
automobile as reported through the years
by the Technic. There is no doubt that
the Technic's coverage of the automobile
has been thorough, and sometimes, espe-
cially in the earlier issues, it has been
very highly technical. So, for a look at
the changing auto and also the changing
style of coverage, let's go back in time to
the 1888 issue of the Technic.
In that issue the first story connected
with the future of the automobile was
written by M. E. Cooley, then a profes-
sor, but soon to become Dean of the Col-
lege of Engineering. Mr. Cooley wrote
25 pages of highly technical material, in-
cluding equations and illustrations, on
"The Dynamics of Reciprocating En-
gines." Generally he was referring to
2 cylinder, 200 H.P. steam engines but
the principle explained was the same
that would soon change the future of the
world. Mr. Cooley's 2 main points were
concerned with (1) the stresses in the
connecting-rod, and its effect in produc-
ing rotation of the crank and, (2) the
pressure required to accelerate the re-
ciprocating parts. In 1902 Mr. Cooley
revised his article to include the latest
developments and it was reprinted in the
Technic.
The gasoline engine was developing
rapidly in the early 1900's but even as
late as 1914 its full automotive potential
was not yet realized. In opening his ar-
ticle on the "History of the Gas Engine"
Mr. A. F. Greiner stated, "After its ra-

OHo &amp; Langen in the 1860's.
pid development, the internal combustion
engine has attained and energetically
maintained its purpose—the supply of
power to industries." Although Mr.
Greiner failed to foresee the future of the
gasoline engine in the auto world he did
give a comprehensive history of this en-
gine from its earliest days in the 1860 s
to that time. For those interested in the
subject Mr. Greiner's 40 pages of ex-
planation and pictures would be very
worthwhile. A few interesting excerpts
from his article follow.
"The idea of the four-cycle engine was
without a doubt first originated in the
mind of Alphonse Beau de Rochas, a
French railway engineer in 1861." His
ideas were the same that we use today—
intake, compression, power, and exhaust
strokes. Although Beau de Rochas pro-
cured a patent in 1862 it was not until
1873 that Christian Reithmann, a Mu-
nich jeweler, had a successful four-cycle
engine in operation.
"A man mentioned frequently in the ar-
ticle, N. A. Otto of Koln, is described as
"one of the most zealous of those who
tried to improve the gas engine." Mr.
Greiner goes on to say, "It cannot be
claimed that Otto was the inventor, or
even the first builder of the four-cycle en-
gine, but he certainly accomplished the
most successful pioneer work in gas en-
gine construction." In 1878 Otto's third
engine was introduced at the Paris Ex-
position. Shortly thereafter Otto engines
in small sizes of 1/6—1/2 H.P. were sold
in great numbers. About this time the
crosshead was considered unnecessary
and the simple construstion common to-
day (1912) was adopted."
It is interesting to note the rapid in-

coverage in its seventy-five-year history.
crease in H.P. once this basic design had
been established by Otto. In 1878 the
largest engine was 4 H.P.; 1880—20
H.P.; 1885—80 H.P.; 1889—100 H.P.;
1900—1000 H.P.; and 1910—4000
H.P.
Mr. Greiner notes also that Westing-
house was the first U.S. company to mar-
ket a 4-cycle engine. After many experi-
ments they came out with a vertical type
engine in 1896.
Another interesting sidelight is con-
nected with the high interest the big
auto companies are showing today in the
"new" free piston engine. It seems that
Reithmann, the first to develop the 4-
cycle engine, actually had built and op-
erated a free piston engine 5 years be-
fore. Similarly, Otto, who was nearing
his aim of perfecting a 4-cycle engine,
became disgusted, and with Langen, built
and operated a free piston engine.
Although Mr. Griener may not have
realized the future of the automobile this
was not the case with 2 young engineer-
ing students. The interest of Stanley R.
and Clayton C. Thomas ('12E) is re-
corded in a 1912 article called "An Auto
Built in the U. of M. Shops by Two En-
gineering Students." "Starting in their
sophomore year every spare moment—
vacations, nights, Saturdays, holidays—
was spent on the designing and construc-
tion of what proved in every way to be a
practical working automobile."
The article reports that "very few
of the parts were bought from manufac-
turing concerns. The aluminum crank
case and twin cylinders were obtained in
the rough and finished. The seat and
tank are the only purchased parts. All
other parts of the entire machine, and the
patterns where necessary, were made in
the engineering shops." Without a doubt,
even today, this would be a tremendous
project for two students to undertake.
In May 1925 both the Technic and the
author missed the boat somewhat. At the
beginning of an article, "Worm Drive
Rear Axles As Applied to Modern Auto-
mobiles; A Future Development," by
Mr. D. McCall White the editors of the
Technic wrote, "One of the most promi-
nent designers of the country has here
presented for us, in descriptive and an-
alytical form, one of the most probable
developments in the future of the auto-
mobile." After a thorough explanation of
how a worm drive would work Mr.
White says, "The author is convinced
that the worm drive rear axle will come
into its own in the very near future."
In the May 1926 issue appeared an in-

PHOTO QUIZ
. . . These should be easy for you
In keeping with the trend of the rest
of the magazine this month's photo quiz
will take on a slightly different character.
The rules for the quiz will be the same
however.
1. All locations must be specifically
identified as to the exact spot on the par-
ticular building or grounds, etc.
2. The correct postcard bearing the
earliest postmark will be declared the
winner.
3. All postcards must be mailed to
the Technic office: The Michigan Technic,
3505 East Eng. Bldg., Ann Arbor, Michi-
gan.
4. All Technic and Arch staff mem-
bers are ineligible for the five dollar
prize.
5. In case of ties, each winner will
receive the full five dollars.
6. Decision of the judges is final.
The added attraction this month is
that all the things pictured may or may
not exist today. However, for an added
help, all the pictures used are from pre-
vious issues of the Technic. If you
haven't been around the campus for 75
years the $5 can still be yours if you're
willing to hunt.
February's winner? The Technic saved
its $5 in February, and also in March,
when February's quiz was repeated.

G. Edward Gearhart was graduated from
the University of Delaware in June. 1956,
with a B.S. in chemical engineering, and
is now working for his Ph.D. in chemical
engineering at Lehigh. At Delaware, he
was editor-in-chief of the yearbook,
"Blue Hen," active in sports and secre-
tary of the Engineering Council.
Ed Gearhart asks:
What does DuPont mean by "on-the-job" training?
Denton Harris answers:
Training is pretty much full-time at
Du Pont, Ed. The main objective is
to train men to reach their full capa-
bilities as soon as possible. So we give
the new man responsibility the day
he arrives, and increase it as oppor-
tunities are available and he's ready
for more responsibility.
That's the basic, guiding policy. But
Du Pont has many departments. And
training has many facets.
In some plants, the college graduate
l&gt;eing trained for supervision is moved
through all areas of the production
cycle. In others, where the technical
phases are more involved, he may
spend time in a laboratory or devel-
opment group before moving on to
production.
It works the same way in sales. The
graduate may first learn the labora-
tory side of the products he's going to
sell. Or he may start right out on
learning selling techniques. That all
depends on the products and markets
involved.
The same on-the-job principle ap-
plies to new men in specialized fields
of research, development or design ...
including daily contacts with super-
vision, frequent lectures, discussions
and conferences. Periodic changes in
assignment, too.
It's carefully planned, individualized
training, Ed. We've found it's the
most effective way to broaden a man
quickly. Du Pont is a growing organ-
ization. And men with leadership po-
tential are always in demand.
Denton B. Harris joined Du Pont's Engi-
neering Research Laboratory in June,
1952, after completing work for an M.S.
in civil engineering at the University of
Massachusetts. He's currently working
on an unusual project —a broad study of
the philosophy of design. The objective
is to learn more about people's design
preferences, and the trends behind new
concepts in industrial design. This new
assignment came after Denton gained
several years of experience in various
kinds of civil engineering at Du Pont.
Are you interested in research work?
About 2000 Du Pont scientists and some
3500 other employees are now engaged
in research. Laboratory facilities of the
highest quality are available at the
DuPont Experimental Station near
Wilmington, and elsewhere throughout
the country. Full information about re-
search work at Du Pont is given in
"Du Pont Research." Write for your copy

Barry Peebles is a freshman in Sci-
ence Engineering. Writing for the
Technic is a "natural" for him, since at
one time he had decided to study journal-
ism. Along this line he was editor of the
Blissfield (Michigan) High School paper
for two years, has written a number of
articles for a daily newspaper; attended a
journalism course at Northwestern Uni-
versity in 1955.
At present Barry hasn't decided which
field of engineering he will eventually
pursue but he says that he favors In-
dustrial Engineering.
teresting article entitled, "Testing Wings
with an Automobile" by Prof. E. A.
Slather. Because wind tunnels were too
small to test wings on a large scale, and
a large size was needed for completely
satisfactory result, Mr. Slather says, "The
prevalence of smooth roads near Ann
Arbor suggesteed the possibility of using
an automobile for the prime mover in
towing wings through the air at a con-
siderable speed and in fairly large sizes."
He adds that the tests were successful.
A technical article, "Current Carbure-
tion," also appeared in the May 1926
issue. Written by C. S. Kegerrus, the
article is a report on tests conducted at
Purdue University. The main purpose of
the tests was to determine the proper
temperatures for good carburetion when
using regular commercial gasoline. Mr.
Kegerrus also felt at the time that car-
buretion experts be given control over
fuel system from the tank to the cylin-
der. He says, "If this viewpoint were
more widely accepted and the carburetor
man given more freedom, less trouble
would be encountered in properly adapt-
ing the carburetor to any engine."
In November of 1926, Dean George
Granger Brown became the second future
dean to write an article for the Technic.
Then a professor in the Chemistry De-
partment, Dean Brown, in collaboration
with George B. Watkins, wrote an article
on "What Makes An Engine Knock? In
part, they wrote, "It was found that re-
tarding the spark largely eliminated this
objectionable noise and the suggestion
was made that the "knock" was due to
pre-ignition. Further experience showed
that the removal of carbon from the sur-
face of the combustion chamber made it
unnecessary to retard the spark to elim-
inate the "knock," which was referred
to as a "carbon knock." Later it was
found that some fuels "knock" more
readily than others. Accordingly the "car-
bon knock" was rechristened the "fuel
knock," as it is now known."
"Much work has been done to find
sources of "anti-knock" gas but relatively
little effort has been expended to deter-
mine the actual cause of the "knock."
After an analysis of the problem they
conclude that the knock is due to auto-
ignition of the unburned part of the
mixture that is compressed against the
hot surfaces by the progressive reaction
initiated.
In a January, 1930 article, "The New
Front Wheel Drive Automobile," Mr. L.
Verne Ansel ('3lE) starts out in a flurry
with, "After five years of exacting ex-
perimental work, the Auburn Automo-
bile Company has introduced America's
first stock front-drive auto. That the front
drive car possesses exclusive advantages
is undeniable." He concludes with, ". . .
and officials of the company say 'we sub-
mit it as a simple statement of fact that
this car requires no selling to those who
can afford it.'" Obviously the dreams of
the Auburn Automobile Co. were never
realized.

There was McOat, stuck in the sand, while the boat
moved on to interesting new horizons. Every day of
standing and watching, and waiting, left him just a
little more frustrated.
McOat was an engineer with imagination, train-
ing and talent. Off to a bad start. Stuck where he
couldn't make fullest use of what he had.
Fortunately, this wasn't fatal for him. It was
merely discouraging, costly and wasteful.
And, as he discovered, there is a bright side to
this picture for all engineers of his capabilities.
Creative imagination and talent are exactly the
qualities most wanted at Chrysler Corporation. Engi-
neers here enjoy the satisfaction of knowing that
they're on the boat from the beginning... enjoying
rewarding careers, making fullest use of their abili-
ties to arrive at those interesting new horizons.
Such engineers have helped us develop many dis-
tinguished automotive firsts, including push-button
driving ... the first practical automotive gas turbine
... and many others, all the way back to all-steel
body construction and hydraulic brakes. Now they
are helping us pioneer beyond the automotive hori-

CHEMICAL AND METALLURGICAL
ENGINEERING
by Professor JOHN BRIER
A man long associated with the Department
of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering
here at Michigan discusses the old — and the
new — looks of this curriculum.
On this the 75th Anniversary of the
Michigan Technic I think it is well to
pause and get away from the rush of to-
day and consider the early events leading
up to this modern age.
I cannot help but think back in my
own personal memory to the early days
of chemical engineering at Michigan.
Arriving on the campus as a freshman
in the fall of 1908 I had occasion to
confer with Professor Edward De Mille
Campbell, who only ten years earlier had
become the first chairman of the newly
founded department of Chemical Engi-
neering. Campbell (class of '86) had
been appointed as Assistant Professor of
Metallurgy in the Department of Chem-
istry following a group of illustrious
chemists in that field.
Alfred Holmes White ('93, '04E)
was appointed instructor in Chemical
Technology in 1897 after his return from
Switzerland where he had been studying.
At that time Campbell who was teaching
metallurgy organized and conducted one
of the earliest courses in metallurgy
given in the United States. To those of
you who have become more or less fa-
miliar with such terms as ferrite, pearlite,
martensite, as identities recognizable in
steel when seen with the microscope, must
realize the greatness of a man who
blinded in his laboratory in 1892 not only
had the courage but the ability to develop
such a course without the aid of any
assistants trained in this field.
It was a real inspiration to his students
to see the way he overcame his handicap.
I will always remember my first day as a
student in his course in beginning
"Quant"—he took apart and assembled
a delicate analytical balance.
The demands for technical assistance in
the infant chemical industry soon brought
Campbell to realize that chemical tech-
nology must be reinforced with engi-
neering know how.
In early 1898 Dean Green of the Engi-
neering College asked for and received
permission from the Regents to establish
a course in Chemical Engineering.
At this time almost all of the first two
years in the Engineering College were
common to all Engineers. In the last two
years additional Chemistry, the two
courses by White in inorganic and organic
Chemistry and the course in metallurgy by
Campbell became the forerunners of
Chemical Engineering. The first regular
class in Chemical Engineering graduated
with five members in 1903.
At this time the staff in Chemical Engi-
neering consisted of Campbell and White
but the work was so closely allied with
Chemistry that Professor Moses Gomberg.
head of Organic Chemistry, was an early
counselor. Early in the history of Chemi-
cal Engineering the Staff felt the need
for training in research and therefore in-
troduced a Senior course of 5 hours
credit designed to introduce the students
to taking research.
At this early period all the courses in
Chemical Engineering were listed in the
Department of Chemistry. This may ac-
count for the fact that "a chemical engi-
neer when talking to an engineer talked
as a chemist while when talking to a
chemist he really considered himself an
engineer."
At any rate Chemical Engineering was
beginning to "grow up" and its impor-
tance was recognized when Alfred H
White was promoted to Junior Professor
of Chemical Engineering in 1908.
It is hard to realize that the first time
Chemical Engineering courses were list-
ed in the Announcement of the Engineer-
ing College was in 1908.
In 1909 the Department began to gro»

White and Instructor Karl Wilhelm Zim-
mershied ('03) who had been added to

the Staff in 1908 to relieve Professor
Campbell and expand the work in metal-
lography and extractive metallurgy. Inci-
dentally to those of you who are present-
ly or recently have been struggling with
the "Iron-Carbon" diagram, it was Zim-
merschied or "Zim" as we knew him who
first introduced me to its intricacies, Yes,
I struggled too.
The speed at which Chemical Engi-
neering was growing may be realized
when in the next 5 years (i.e. to 1914),
E. E. Ware in 1909, A. E. White in 1911,
W. L. Badger in 1912 and John D. Rue
in 1913 were added to the staff. A. E.
White replaced Zimmershied who had re-
signed.
Professor Campbell's administrative
work as Chairman of the Department of
Chemistry and Director of the Chemical
Laboratories demanded so much of his
time that he resigned as Chairman of the
Department of Chemical Engineering in
1914, turning it over to Prof. Alfred H.
White.
Before passing away from the Camp-
bell administration I must pay tribute
to his work in enhancing the reputation
of the department of Chemical Engineer-
ing at Michigan. Though his research
work in the field of metallurgy cost him
his eye-sight in 1892 his courage was
not daunted. Many of the readers may
remember Professor White's reference to
Campbell's early work in Portland cement
published in 1903.
Professors White and Campbell were
very close to each other and perhaps it
was White's remark to Campbell in a
letter written from Zurich, Switzerland
where he was studying at the Federal
Polytechnicum that was the spark that
touched off Professor Campbell's enthu-
siasm that resulted in establishing Chemi-
cal Engineering at Michigan. Knowing
Professor White's forcefulness as I did,
I think it very well might have been
White who aroused Professor Campbell's
interest in the courses in Chemical Tech-
nology being given there.
The date of 1914 may be considered as
the end of the first phase in the develop-
ment of Chemical Engineering.
The period beginning in 1911 when
White was promoted to full professor
was one in which he was organizing and
laying a solid foundation for the future.
The appointments of Ware, Rue, Badger,
A. E. White and Upthegrove added
momentum to the rapid development and
growth of the department. Ware under-
took to develop the protective coatings
field and Rue started work and Research
in a most important Michigan Industry,
Pulp and Paper.
The advent of World War I in 1917
retarded development somewhat. The
Army Ordnance suddenly realized that
munitions of War required assistance
from technical men in civil life, particu-
larly Chemical Engineers, Metallurgists
and Chemists. This need was met by
recruiting faculty men from many colleges
and universities.
Profs. A. H. White, Ware, Rue, A. E.
White and Upthegrove were given
leaves of absence and commissioned in
the organized reserve. Professors A. E.
White and Upthegrove being metallurg-
ists played key parts in development of

ammunition. Professors A. H. White,
Ware and Rue layed an important role
in the early development of nitric acid
production from the nitrogen of the air.
The departure of so many teachers
from the department left only Professor
W. L. Badger and Dr. Joseph Stanley
Laird as permanent staff members. It was,
therefore, necessary to seek additional as-
sistance.
Dr. C. D. Holley was technical direc-
tor of the Acme White Lead and Color
Works in Detroit was appointed to act as
chairman of the department on a part-
time basis. William Piatt Wood and the
writer were appointed Assistant Professors
Clarence Smart and Franz Zimmerle,
who were graduates of the department,
academic experience that those of us who
went through it will never forget.
Perhaps the most notable achievement
of the war period was the starting of the
evaporator laboratory. Badger, who by
this time was dedicated to the develop-
ment of unit operation, persuaded the
Swenson Evaporator Company of Chicago
to install a specially designed basket type
vertical tube evaporator. It was especially
designed for research work and was in-
stalled in the old boiler house directly
back of the North end of West Engineer-
ing Building, now used as the ROTC
rifle range. It was not an ideal spot but
was the only one available. It was the
forerunner of the present Unit Operations
Laboratory where it is still in use in the
East Engineering Building. Research work

served as instructors, as did Adolphe
Wendler, who joined us in 1918.
It seemed advisable to secure an addi-
tional man of experience. Such a man was
Edwin M. Baker who came to us as an
instructor in 1918.
The war period was one of frenzied
activity. The student body was augmented
by the Student Army Training Corps. To
keep these men on the beam was an
in the field of heat transfer was started
and many valuable contributions to the
literature were made by Badger and his
doctoral students as a result.
At the close of the war, Professors
Ware and Rue chose to forsake academic-
careers for the business world.
Professors Alfred H. White and A. E.
White returned to the campus as Colonels
and Professor Upthegrove as a Major.
To be sure, Professor Brier has
been here at the University, in one
capacity or another, as long as near-
ly anyone. His years between 1908
and 1912 were spent in preparation
for his B.S. in chemistry. His M.S.
came a year later in 1913. Prof.
Brier worked in industry as director
of research at the Holland Research
Co. for several years prior to return-
ing to his alma mater.
When asked to write an article on
his department for this anniversary
issue, he remarked: "Little did I
realize that I should have the honor
of writing this brief resume of
chemical engineering and being a
historian, when I was a student
under, or a colleague with, every in-
structor and professor in the Depart-
ment of Chemical Engineering."
Of course, Holley and I returned to our
respective jobs in industry.
Professor White immediately found
himself confronted with the Herculean
task of coping with a mushroom growth
immediately after his return.
Eugene H. Leslie was added to the staff
in 1919 and his interest in the field ol
petroleum industries played a very im-
portant part in the future trend of the
department. G. G. Brown was appointed
as instructor in 1920. The Dean tackled
the job of acquiring a doctor's degree at
the same time. He was one of Leslie's first
students and his thesis work in petroleum
research was "The Rate of Pressure Rise
in Gaseous Explosion," of great impor-
tance in internal combustion engine de-
sign.
The development of the department
during the period 1920 to 1942 saw great
strides in the growth of chemical engi-
neering.
Baker joined with Professor Badger in
forwarding the development of Unit
Operations and their book "Inorganic
Technology" contributed to the evolution
from descriptive to the quantitative ap-
proach in chemical engineering.
In 1931 Badger joined with McCabe 1
in their classic "Elements of Chemical
Engineering."

a very vital part in forwarding chemical
engineering.
With the moving of Chemical Engi-
neering from the Chemistry Building to
its present location and establishment of
the Unit Operations Laboratory by Bad-
ger, Chemical Engineering was really on
its way.
The field of petroleum technology was
wide open to scientific attack and while
Leslie started the ball rolling in this field,
Dean Brown has been the real factor be-
hind its development. His many contribu-
tions, both in men and publications, have
played a tremendous part in the advance-
ment of Chemical Engineering. To an-
alyze the total impact of Brown's work
with the properties of mixed hydrocar-
bons, particularly vapor-pressure relation-
ships, would require much more space
than has been allotted.
The application of thermodynamics in
his field led Brown to realize chemical
engineering education was deficient in the
subject. During the period prior to World
War II, he developed graduate courses
in this field.
An interesting development began in
the early Twenties when Professor White
agreed to a request by the Navy to estab-
lish training in explosives for post grad-
uate students of the Naval Academy. It
fell to me to develop the explosive
courses for these officers which they took
as part of their required work for the
MSSE in Chemical Engineering.
That the officers were a well-picked
group is borne out when we realize some
of their accomplishments. Their part in
World War II was indeed important.
Admiral C. Turner Joy who struggled
so patiently at the armistice table at Pan-
munjung at the close of the Korean War
was one of the students in the first class
at Michigan. Admiral Arleigh Burke, the
present Chief of Naval Operations, re-
ceived his M.S.E. from Michigan as one
of the group in 1931. Incidentally, it may
be of interest to many that Justice Talbot
Smith of the Michigan Supreme Court
was one of the early naval officers to re-
ceive his M.S.E. from Michigan in this
naval program.
The work in explosives coupled with
the presence of Col. Alfred H. White and
Major Upthegrove * led to the establish-
ment of summer schools for Ordnance
Reserve officers in the field of ammunition
laading. Upthegrove gave the work in
metal component; Major Mickle** gave
work in gauging. It fell my lot to develop
the explosive side of getting explosives
properly loaded in shell, bombs, fuzes,
The success of these summer courses
can be credited to Professor White, who
as Colonel White, was our commanding
officer.
The other important aspect of the
period between the wars was the changes
in metallurgical engineering which up to
the later Twenties was primarily one of
the elective groups in chemical engineer-
ing. By 1929, however, separate graduate
programs in metallurgical engineering
were recognized by the Graduate School
and in 1935 the B.S.E. (Metallurgical
Engineering) was established in the Engi-
neering College and the Department of
Chemical Engineering became the De-
partment of Chemical and Metallurgical
Engineering.
Over this period Wood and Upthe-
grove developed the work in ferrous and
non-ferrous metallurgy.
A. E. White began the work in high
temperature testing of creep in metal. Dr.
Claude Clarke and Professor James Free-
man devoted all their time as research
engineers to this field. In the early
Thirties, Dr. Schneidewind did a great
deal of work in the kinetics of the mal-
leableizing process. Actually his doctoral
dissertation was in this field with Profes-
sor A .E. White being the chairman of his
committee.
An outstanding addition to the metal-
lurgical program was started when Profes-
sor A. H. White added Dr. Lars Thomas-
sen to the staff as Assistant Professor to
develop courses and laboratory work in
x-rays. His work was of immeasurable
value in this period in forwarding prog-
ress in chemical engineering.
* These men still held their commissions in
the Ordnance Reserve Corps.
** of Mechanical Engineering.
*** Brier had been Command Major in the
Specialist Reserve.
The period of World War II might be
designated a transition period.
Professor White retired in 1942 and
Professor G. G Brown took over the
chairmanship until relinquishing it to
Professor Donald L. Katz when G. G.
Brown became our present Dean.
This I think should be a proper stop-
ping point for "Glimpses into the past of
chemical engineering." I should feel that
I had left the department dangling in
thin air and done an injustice to what I
choose to call "The New Look in Chemi-
cal Engineering."
At the time the writer was called to
active duty in the army in 1942 we were
just getting underway in research on the
rate of nitration of toluene with a grad-
uate student [Clyde McKinley], For-
tunately Prof. R. R. White was interested
in the possibilities of this work and took
charge of it as Desterol Committee Chair-
man of one of the graduate student.
The excellent work done in this field
was rewarded with the awarding of The
Junior Award in Chemical Engineering
by the American Chemical Society in
1945 to Prof. R. R. White.
Banchero and York kept the Unit
Operations program rolling during the
war. Townsend the applied physical prop-
erties laboratory.
Since the war, development in chemical
and Metallurgical Engineering has risen
to a high pace, under the active influ-
ence of the young and younger genera-
tion of staff members. Remember "50 is
the youth of old age."
In concluding these reminiscences "a
glimpse into the early history of Chemical
Engineering," I hope my many colleagues,
particularly the post-war "youngsters"
will forgive me for not adding more of a
chapter on the "New Look" in Chemical
and Metallurgical Engineering.
In conclusion I may have exceeded
my allotment of space and time, but I
know that the pioneers of Chemical and
Metallurgical Engineering at Michigan
who have passed on to the life eternal
would never forgive me if I did not add
their congratulations with mine to the
Michigan Technic on their outstanding
accomplishments in this their 75th Cen-
tennial.

There are a lot of things to consider in

made it" is also reported in the January,
1930 Technic. Samuel B. Malin ('32E)
writes in "The Cadillac V-16" that the
"tendency toward larger motors and
higher powered cars has received an im-
petus with the creation the new V-type
16 cylinder motor car. Cadillac just in-
troduced the new car at the New York
show, where it caused a sensation."
Even though the V-16 never reached
mass production many new and interest-
ing features were introduced, some of
which are used today. They included an
automotive valve silencer, which does
away with tappet noises; a vacuum as-
ened stroke has stepped the speed up to
a maximum well over 70 mph. Buick—
adding dash to its already graceful
beauty appears to have been the most
notable achievement. By skirting the fen-
ders, slip streaming the back panel, and
air stream styling from bumper to
bumper, the body designers have achieved
the modern without being extreme. Chrys-
ler products—one of the main body fea-
tures to be found in this new line is the
deluxe appearance of the interiors. A fine

sister in the braking system; and thermo-
statically controlled chankcase ventilat-
ing system.
Mr. Malin realized, somewhat, the un-
likely future of the V-16 when he closed
with, "The Cadillac development repre-
sents the most ambitious departure from
concentional practice the industry has
seen for years."
A brief idea of the depression day
automobile is given by Howard M. Jones
('33E) in "The 1933 Auto Review. He
reports—Chevrolet has a new, much
more smartly designed model. A length-
In January, 1936 John Byer ('36E)
wrote an article that could have been re-
printed during '47-'48 Tucker automobile
escapade. Writing on "The Rear Engine
Auto" he says, "The rear engine auto-
mobile marked the beginning of automo-
bile history in both America and Europe.
But the development of the multiple-
cylinder vertical engine made it impos-
sible to mount the engine as had been
done previously, and by 1908 the rear
engine was abandoned in the U. S."
Mr. Beyer brings out both the strong
and weak points of the rear engine by
saying, "The rear engine, while aiding
rear wheel adhesion, has given rise to
poor steering qualities with the reduced
load on the front wheels." He concludes
that "two or three concerns are engaged
in experimental work on rear-engine ve-
hicles and perhaps they will produce
something of value. The problem is an in-
teresting one from an engineering view-
point."
In 1939 the automobile industry intro-
duced fluid drive and hydramatic and in
May of that year the Technic reported
the latest developments. In explaining the
basic principle James R. Davidson
('40E) states, "The hydraulic clutch de-
pends on the fact that modern engines
have enough power to start a car in high
gear if a clutch is provided which is per-
fectly smooth and which is not damaged
by any amount of slipping." He ends by
saying that if prices are brought into
range it will become one of the biggest
features of the automobile . . . and it has.
"The Practical Post-War Car" was the
subject of a 1944 article by Edard C
De Smet, Executive Engineer, Willys-
Overland Motors, Inc. Here is what he
said on things that were still in the idei
stage then: Aluminum bodies—steel will
always be cheaper; Plywood bodies—
would limit design to very simple shapes;
plastic bodies—the fact is that the one
piece all-plastic automobile body is defi-
nitely out of the question; and curbed
windshield and glass upper surfaces—
possible but not probable.
The Technic has continued to report
changes in the auto world in the post war
years right up to the present time, includ-
ing articles this year on the gas turbine
and free piston engines. The automobile
has changed greatly since the first days of
the Technic but so has the Technic
itself. Not only has it changed in style
and format but also in comprehension
and interpretation of the entire field ot
science and engineering. As science and
engineering is constantly changing, the
Technic will always strive in the future,
as in the past, to bring its readers up-to-
date and on informative news of the
engineering world.

STUDENT
by Professor ROBERT H. SHERLOCK
Now, when we are reviewing the growth of
the Technic and the paralleling growth of the
College of Engineering, it is appropriate to
pause and consider the future. Here is a dis-
cussion of the relationship of the engineering
student with his education and his profession.
Someone has said that the ideal uni-
versity consists of a log with a student on
one end and a professor on the other.
This idyllic situation would scarcely pro-
vide a field day for bookkeepers and per-
sonnel managers. But in our day, when
a university may contain thousands of stu-
dents and hundreds of faculty members,
it is a matter of concern whether the
university is to become an efficient fac-
tory or is to remain an association of
scholars dedicated to the education of
young adults.
It is still true that the students and the
faculty constitute the most important
elements of a university and that if a
university is to possess high quality it
must be because both of these elements
possess the necessary ingredients for
greatness.
A state university must be responsive
to the wishes of the people of the state.
The University of Michigan has met this
requirement and at the same time has
achieved the stature of one of the world's
truly great universities. This has been
possible, in a very large measure, because
early in its history the university was
given the dignified status of a constitu-
tional entity, wherein authority was
vested in a Board of Regents whose mem-
bers were elected directly by the vote of
the people.
There are few major universities in
this country where the faculty carries such
a large part of the administrative func-
tions as at the University of Michigan,
not only in the academic affairs of the
University, but in all of its activities.
Under this policy successive generations
of faculty members have built up tra-
ditions of conduct and of attitudes which
enable the present day faculty members
to carry their responsibilities with a poise
and maturity which justifies the confidence
of the governing boards. This is bound
to have an effect in determining the type
of person who is drawn into the univer-
sity as a part of this essential component,
the faculty. It is safe to assume that The
Board of Regents will continue policies
which will attract to the University fa-
culty members to whom the student body
may look with confidence for strong and
progressive guidance.
A recent study has shown that not
more than the upper 17 percent of the
graduating classes from first rate high
schools are capable of taking training
leading to acceptable competence in any
one of the major professional fields, and
that engineering is at least on a par with
the other professional programs from the
standpoint of difficulty. Even if a 100
percent margin is allowed for the error
of the foregoing estimate we must still
arrive at the conclusion that the young
man who aspires to a professional status
in the practice of engineering must have
an academic potential which will enable
him to achieve a standing in the upper
third of his high school graduating class.
Even a number of years ago, when the
requirements for the engineering student
were not as rigorous as they are today,
studies at the University of Michigan
showed that a high school student in the
upper half of his class but below the
upper third, had less than a 5 percent
chance of ever graduating in engineering
at the University of Michigan. It is quite
certain that the chances against him are
even greater today.
There is a growing belief in the major
engineering societies today that a dis-
tinction must be drawn between the re-
quirements for the professional practice
of engineering and the requirements for
practice at a sub-professional or tech-
nician level. As this feeling grows, and
I am sure that it will, the need for tech-
nical institutes will become more acute,
and a number of those institutions which
now recruit their engineering student
body largely from those who are in the
lower ranks of the high school graduat-
ing classes, will be unable to attain ac-
creditation as engineering colleges and
must proceed as technical institutes. In
speaking of the future engineering stu-
dent at Michigan we will assume that the
very much needed service of training
technicians and sub-professional personnel
will be done elsewhere than at Michigan.
Today we hear much of the shortage of

Professor Robert H. Sherlock has combined an active teaching
career with outside consultation on design, investigation, ap-
praisals, and reports. He received his degree in Civil Engineering
at Purdue University in 1920. Professor Sherlock came to the
University of Michigan in 1923 as an assistant professor in C.E.,
and has been a full professor since 1933.
He has done considerable research concerning wind gusts,
the flow phenomenon of smoke stacks, and wind velocities for
the design of low buildings. During his career he has worked
with the American Bridge Co. in Toledo as a supervisor of field
work on bridge and dock repairs.
engineers. The young engineer is in a
bargaining position that has never before
existed in the engineering field in peace-
time. As a result, advancement is rapid
and the engineer finds himself at a rela-
tively young age in a position where he is
called upon to assume responsibilities of
a truly professional character. This in-
evitably calls upon personal resources be-
yond technological or scientific proficien-
cy, resources which are frequently
grouped under the term "character" and
include such traits as habitual honesty,
fair dealing, poise and mature judgment.
An example of the changing situation
which is facing the coming generation of
engineers is to be found in the practice
of the consulting civil engineer. During
the past five years many new firms of
young engineers have been formed and
have been able to expand their activities
into sizeable ventures. It is not unusual
for the older and larger firms of this
kind to have responsibility for the design
and construction of work running into
the hundreds of millions of dollars.
Where there is honey there are flies and
where there are large sums of money be-
ing spent there will always be a few who
seek to participate in it on an actual or a
near-racketeering basis. The engineer
must protect his client and can meet his
responsibilities as a faithful servant only
if he has the most inflexible integrity
and courage to see him through. This ex-
ample will be expanded during the next
ten years when at least $30 billion will
become available for the expansion of our
highway program and this sum will be
merely the beginning.
We speak rather glibly of the field of
engineering into which these students
will go, but it is not easy to define the
limits of that field. This is partly due to
the fact that engineering education has
proven a worthwhile foundation upon
which to build a successful career in
fields which are ordinarily not considered
to be engineering. The definition which
is most widely recognized runs about as
follows: "Engineering is the art of or-
ganizing and directing men and of con-
trolling the forces and materials of nature
in the solution of specific problems of
human need." There has been a tendency
to emphasize the material side of the
definition to the exclusion of the human
side. However, successful engineers rec-
ognize the broader service which the en-
gineer should render, with the accom-
panying greater rewards. I am thoroughly
convinced that the tendency to cram more
and more technical and scientific work
into the four year program, to the detri-
ment of the more general features of their
education, has hampered the engineers in
later life when they should have earned
recognition in the human side of engi-
neering, namely, the organizing and
directing of men. We should hope to turn
out engineers who think like engineers
but are able to talk like lawyers. The
lawyers are pre-eminently able to appraise
the viewpoint of those with whom they
deal and to present their ideas in such a
way that they appeal to those viewpoints.
On the other hand the engineer has four
years of such intensive work at the tech-

is pre-eminently able to solve. .certain
types of problems in conformity with the
laws of nature but has little or no skill
in presenting the solutions which he has
worked out to hose who make decisions,
and who too frequently are not engineers.
In summary it may be said that the fu-
ture engineering student at Michigan
will be a man who aspires to a profes-
sional status in engineering and will not
be satisfied to train for a technician's job.
He will be one who has given early evi-
dence of academic potential by his stand-
ing in the upper third of his graduating
high school class. He will be a man of
integrity, using that term in its traditional
sense, rather than in the sense assigned
to it by some of the present day sophists.
He will be a man of habitual honesty, of
poise and maturity, who will be able to
avoid the pitfalls which lie in the paths
of all those who achieve success and
shoulder responsibility. Is this too much
to expect in a professional man?

JOHN MORAN, who joined Western Electric's engineering staff at the Kearny Works recently, is now studying for his M.S.M.E. under the new
Tuition Refund Plan. Western Electric expects to refund the tuition for John's graduate study at the Newark College of Engineering this year.

can help you continue your studies while
launching an exciting career
Under the new plan, Western Electric will refund
tuition costs for after-hours study at graduate or
undergraduate level, up to a maximum of $250 for
each school year.
Say, for example, that you decide on a career at
Western Electric in one of many rewarding phases
of telephony—electronics, development engineer-
ing, design, manufacturing production, plant engi-
neering, or some other. You may be eligible for
financial assistance to help defray the cost of grad-
uate or other study from the very first day. Choose
engineering, science or any course that is appro-
priate to your job or that adds to your ability to
accept greater responsibility, and the Company
will refund to you up to $250 a year for tuition.
(You'll note from the map on this page that
Western Electric's work locations are well situated
in terms of major population areas. That means that
many of the nation's best schools are close by.)
Plus values, like the new Tuition Refund Plan,
give Western Electric engineers many opportuni-
ties that others never have. There's specialized
training both in the classroom and on the job...
a formal program of advanced engineering study
that includes full-time, off-job courses of up to 10
weeks' duration ... a retirement and benefit pro-
gram that's one of the best known and most liberal
in industry... low-cost life insurance that would
appeal to any man with his eye on the future. And
of paramount importance is the chance to work
alongside top men in the field of communications.
There's a good deal more for which there isn't
space here. Why not write us or contact your place-
ment office to schedule an interview when Bell
System representatives visit your campus.
WesternBecwc
As one of us, you'd help engineer the manufac-
ture, distribution or installation of the equipment
needed for the nation-wide communications net-
work of 49 million Bell telephones.
Here—where transistors were first developed for
production; where repeaters for the new transat-
lantic telephone cable were tailor-made—there's a
constant need for new products and new processes.
Two-thirds of the equipment we make today for
the Bell telephone companies is of types developed
since World War II.
Besides telephone work, Western Electric—over
the years — has been responsible for a continuous
flow of defense jobs for the government such as the
Nike guided missile system and the DEW Line.
There's plenty of room for advancement. . .
whatever your field of specialization. So—whether
you'd be helping with our telephone job, or work-
ing on a major defense project like guided missile
systems—with Western Electric you can expect to

MECHANICS
by Professor RUSSELL DODGE
Although one of the smaller units of the Col-
lege, Engineering Mechanics is steadily in-
creasing in scope and enrollment.
Professor Dodge received his
B.S. in Civil Engineering and his
M.S. from the University in 1916
and 1917 respectively. Since 1921
he has been a member of the engi-
neering faculty here and was made
a full professor of Engineering me-
chanics in 1921. Until recently
Prof. Dodge was Chairman of the
Departments of Engineering Me-
chanics and Engineering Drawing.
Now as Chairman of Engineering
Mechanics alone he will better be
able to devote his full attention to
the advancement of this field.
Some of the many organizations
of which he is a member include
Tau Beta Pi, Phi Kappa Phi, Sigma
Xi, ASEE, and ASCE. He has done
considerable consulting work on
construction and design of sewage
systems, drains, and water works.
We quote from the minutes of the
Meeting of the Engineering Faculty,
July 11th, 1911:
"Present—
President Hutchins, Professors Coo-
ley, Campbell, Ziwet, Lorch, Hobbs,
Allen, Guthe, Anderson, Glover,
Greene, Wait, Goulding, White, Til-
den, Ford, Smith, Pierce, Running,
Field, Bragg, Henderson, Ellis, Moyer,
Bursley, Parker, Zowski, Bird, and
other members of the Faculty.
The reading of the minutes of the
past meeting was omitted.
The following resolution was pre-
sented from the Standing Committee:
July 19, 1911
To the Faculty of the Department of
Engineering:
At a meeting of the Standing Com-
mittee July 8th, 1911, the following
actions were passed:
1. It was moved and carried that it
be the sense of this committee that
the Faculty of Engineering recommend
to the Regents to establish a depart-
ment of Engineering Mechanics.
(Signed) H. J. Goulding,
Acting Secretary
It was moved and carried that res-
lution No. 1 be adopted and that the
Board of Regents be asked to put it
into immediate force."
Then followed a second motion ap-
proving a committee report which im-
plemented the change, showing how the
new courses were to be placed in the sev-
eral curricula. A minority report was re-
jected and the report was adopted by the
faculty and approved by the President
with his signature affixed.
By this action the "Department of
Engineering and Architecture" took a
then bold step forward in engineering
education by placing the teaching of
theoretical mechanics in the hands of a
special group. At the same time it adopt-
ed a new title, Engineering Mechanics,
for the general area, a name now general-
ly accepted and just recently has been
adopted by several schools to designate
programs and departments.
Although the action of the faculty
seemed smooth enough, the presence of
the President, his unusual signature of
approval, and the minority report, hint
that the birth of the new department was
not without pain. It was in fact preceeded
by two years of discussion in which men
of strong convictions opposed and advo-
cated the action. Only an old grad will
realize that those present at the meeting
constituted an august group. But the very
old grad probably will also believe that
the change was brought about by the stu-
dents' difficulties with a course known as
S and R, Strength and Resistance, now
better known by a popular misnomer as
Strength of Materials. He may still
believe that it was not a great French
marshal but teachers of S and R who
first used the motto, "They shall not
pass." Those who knew these men will
stoutly defend them as strong men, earn-
est and sympathetic teachers, but demand-
ing.
It seems fair to believe that the crea-
tion of the Department of Engineering
Mechanics was merely the response to an
established need, a progressive movement
led by a forward-looking dean, but ac-
companied by misgivings like nearly all
such changes.
In his communication to the Regents,
Dean Cooley said, in part, ". . . there has
grown up the belief, now general in the
Department (College) that it is too much
to expect of a group of men, all special-

design.
ists in one branch of engineering, to pre-
sent the several subjects in applied me-
chanics in a manner best suited to the
varied needs of the Department, (Col-
lege) made up, as it is, of a large num-
ber of branches in engineering.
Applied mechanics is fundamental to
all branches of engineering, but some
branches require a more extended treat-
ment of portions of the subject than
others. ... It is therefore, proposed to
embrace in engineering mechanics the
courses required by all students alike,
leaving each department to supplement
the general courses along a desired line;
or, if preferred by any department, there
will be offered under engineering me-
chanics additional courses to meet the
special needs of that department.
In this way two important objects will
be accomplished: First, the keeping to-
gether of all the students of the different
branches for a longer period, and in con-
sequence, a greater homogeneity in the
Department (College); . . ."
The foregoing words of Dean Cooley,
urging the establishment of a Depart-
ment of Engineering Mechanics, seem
nearly as appropriate today as ever.
The uninitiated student or the lay
reader will understand the position of
engineering mechanics in the field of en-
neering much better after a brief de-
scription of its content. The term me-
chanics when used by a physicist refers
to a division of science which deals with
laws governing mass, motion and force.
The expression, Engineering Mechanics,
is used to designate the same scientific
material when expanded and rearranged
to emphasis its relation and application
to engineering problems. The subject
embraces a large quantity of scientific ma-
terial which is based on physics and
mathematics and which, in its elementary
phase, occupies a place in the curriculum
between those two subjects and engineer-
ing design. It is understandable that most
engineers think of mechanics as the
modicum of material to which they were
exposed as undergraduates. Actually the
subject is as broad and as deep as one
wishes to make it and its boundaries are
quite undefined.
In 1929 the Faculty and Regents pio-
neered again when they authorized a pro-
gram leading to the degree of BSE, Engi-
neering Mechanics, and the degree was
granted for the first time in June 1930,
to one man. Since then there have been
many, but only a handful each year.
The graduate program has existed from
the beginning and many more advanced
degrees than bachelors degrees have been
granted. The first of these was appropri-
ately the doctorate awarded to Jan A. Van
den Brock, now Professor Emeritus, in
1918. The next was in 1928, and since
then there has been a steady output of
masters and doctors. All of these seem
well satisfied with their choice. Although
the graduates have entered many fields of
engineering and business, the greatest
impact has been made on the teaching
profession and the Department of Engi-
neering Mechanics is particularly proud
of the comparatively large number of out-
standing engineering educators numbered
among its alumni. These men and the
many more who have gone into industry,
research, and management have demon-
strated that mechanics is an excellent
preparation for any line of technical en-
deavor. To name a few of these or to
name a few of the teachers would be un-
fair to the many. Hence, for a complete
history, the reader is referred to "A Cen-
tury of Engineering Education," Univer-
sity of Michigan Press, 1954.
The engineering graduate of today-
may find himself eventually in almost any
conceivable line of work. Even after one
has decided to enter a conventional pro-
fessional division it is impossible for
one to train for all types of employment.
He can scarcely anticipate the future edu-
cational needs even for well defined
specialty. For that reason many feel that
acquiring a strong basic training is one
of the best ways to prepare for the wide
variety of responsibilities which may come
and to keep the doors open to future op-
portunities in many fields. The program
in Engineering Mechanics is designed to
provide that basic training.

. . . ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
It is surprising to find that a field of endeavor
as highly advanced today as electrical engi-
neering is sixty-eight years old; yet that many
years ago, this department had its beginning
at Michigan.
The Department of Electrical Engi-
neering traces its beginning back to 1889
and the east basement room of the Phys-
ics Laboratory. Here a small laboratory
was established, as part of the Physics
Department, for a course in dynamo-
electric machinery. Equipment consisted
of a twenty-five-horsepower steam engine
for driving a line shaft, a five kilowatt
Edison dynamo, a constant potential mo-
tor of five horsepower, a ten arc Brush
dynamo with arc lamps, and a Brackett
cradle dynamometer. A photometric room
was located next to the laboratory and
another room contained a thirty-one cell
storage battery.
More courses in electricity were offered
by the Physics Department in the early
1890's. In 1893 the first course of a pro-
fessional rather than a theoretical nature
was introduced. It was a course in elec-
trical machinery design taught by Pro-
fessor Henry Smith Carhart (Wesleyan
'69, Sc.D. hon. Northwestern '12), who
had taught the first electricity classes
in the Physics Laboratory basement.
The Department of Electrical Engi-
neering was instituted in 1895-96 as the
electrical engineering courses were separ-
ated from the Physics Department. The
curriculum was expanded with the ad-
dition of Electrical Measurements and
Primary Batteries. By 1897-98, the staff
was enlarged to four members.
Facilities for the Department of Elec-
trical Engineering were improved in 1904
when the south half of the West Engi-
neering Building was completed. The
Department moved into the south part
of the West Engineering basement.
The period of 1905-15 witnessed the
steady growth of the Electrical Engineer-
ing Department. With George Washing-
ton Patterson (Yale '84, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology '87, Ph.D.
Munich '99) as head of the department,
the staff was doubled, enrollment was in-
creased, and new equipment was pro-
cured. The number of courses offered
Measurement of the power Output and gain of a Wideband Travel-
ing Wave Amplifier.
grew from sixteen to thirty-two. Require-
ments of courses in communication were
partly responsible for the increase in
classes. When the north end of the West
Engineering Building was finished in
1909, the offices of the department and
dynamo laboratories were moved there.
The illumination laboratories were moved
to the attic while the communications
laboratories were left in the basement.
Carl Page, an active contributor
to the Technic with such articles
as "Heat Barrier", "The New Aero-
train", and "Reflections of a Fresh-
man" was active in high school
also. Carl Graduated from Flint
Mandeville High School, where he
participated in Student Council and
Debates, and was Class President.
Carl is a freshman in Science Engi-
neering and in the future he plans
to do research work.
John Castlereagh Parker ('01, A.M.
'02, E.E. '04, D. Eng. hon. '40) became
chairman of the department when Pro-
fessor Patterson was appointed chairman
of the Department of Engineering Me-
chanics. Parker made several changes in
the curriculum and in the general phil-
osophy of the department. In the early-
days of electrical engineering, it was pos-
sible to give the student a general picture
of the whole field, plus details of prac-
tice. However, theory had been developed
extensively and many complicated applica-
tions had resulted. It was no longer pos-
sible to cover the whole field of electrical
engineering in four years. There had to
be a choice between increased specializa-
tion and more general and theoretical
courses. The idea that students should
specialize after graduation was supported
by both staff members and industry.
Therefore, the descriptive courses were
dropped, reducing from thirty-two to
twenty-three courses in 1919. This period
was also marked by a general stiffening
of requirements.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


in the field of Aerodynamics
Although each successive chapter in
the history of aircraft engines has as-
signed new and greater importance
to the problems of aerodynamics,
perhaps the most significant de-
velopments came with the dawn of
the jet age. Today, aerodynamics
is one of the primary factors in-
fluencing design and performance of
an aircraft powerplant. It follows,
then, that Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft
— world's foremost designer and
builder of aircraft engines — is as
active in the broad field of aero-
dynamics as any such company
could be.
Although the work is demanding,
by its very nature it offers virtually
unlimited opportunity for the aero-
dynamicist at P &amp; W A. He deals
with airflow conditions in the en-
gine inlet, compressor, burner, tur-
bine and afterburner. From both the
theoretical and applied viewpoints,
he is engrossed in the problems of
perfect, viscous and compressible
flow. Problems concerning boundary
layers, diffusion, transonic flow,
shock waves, jet and wake phenom-
ena, airfoil theory, flutter and
stall propagation — all must be at-
tacked through profound theoretical
and detailed experimental processes.
Adding further to the challenge and
complexity of these assignments at
P &amp; W A is this fact: the engines
developed must ultimately perform
in varieties of aircraft ranging from
supersonic fighters to intercontinen-
tal bombers and transports, func-
tioning throughout a wide range of
operational conditions for each type.
Moreover, since every aircraft is
literally designed around a power-
plant, the aerodynamicist must con-
tinually project his thinking in such
a way as to anticipate the timely
application of tomorrow's engines to
tomorrow's airframes. At his service
are one of industry's foremost com-
puting laboratories and the finest
experimental facilities.
Aerodynamics, of course, is only
one part of a broad!} &lt;iiversified en-
gineering program at Pratt &amp; Whit-
ney Aircraft. That program — with
other far-reaching activities in the
fields of instrumentation, combus-
tion, materials problems and me-
chanical design — spells out a
gratifying future for many of to-
day's engineering students.

sis and the solution of aerodynamic problems. Some of

So 1/ou think St 5 A/eur . . .
This month I am going to deviate
slightly from the former trend of this
feature; in order to illuminate the past
accomplishments of the Technic, this
month the feature will deal with a seem-
ingly recent idea that was written up by
this magazine several years ago.
The concept dealt with was the peace-
time use of atomic energy. Amazingly
enough the article was written in February
1934, before there was even a thought
of using this vast energy source as a
weapon of destruction.
Continually probing the mystery of the
elements, scientists have resorted to many
means of breaking down the more com-
plex atoms into hydrogen and helium
nuclei and studying the radiations and
emanations occuring when these trans-
formations take place. Probably the most
interesting of these methods is that of
bombarding metals with positive ions
which are given enormous velocities by
the use of high potentials. At the present
time there are three such set-ups in the
country; the gigantic one at The Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology, one at
Washington, D.C. and one in our own
East Physics Building.
Under the supervision of Professor
James Cork, this super experiment is
being set up and operated. The apparatus
is housed in a very large room which ex-
tends in height through both the basement
and sub-basement of the Physics Building.
Perhaps the most striking object to one
viewing the apparatus is the large alum-
inum sphere which is used to collect the
electric charge. This sphere is six feet in
diameter and was constructed in the shops
of the University. It is supported by a
"Texolite" pillar, eight feet high and
three feet in diameter which is construct-
ed of impregnated, laminated, pressed
paper. The finished cylinder is coated
with ceresin which is impervious to
water and has a very high surface resis-
tance. Since the sphere attains very high
voltages, the pillar must be made
of excellent insulating material. The
base of the pillar rests on a large com-
partment which houses the equipment for
spraying the electric charge on moving
belts which carry the charge to the sphere
at the top of the pillar.
In order to produce very high voltages
which serve to accelerate the ions, it is
necessary to get as much charge on the
sphere as possible, since its voltage is
proportional to its charge. The moving
belts which carry the charge from the
base of the pillar to the sphere move in-
side the pillar. They are made of paper
sixteen inches wide and each is capable
of supporting one and one half tons in
tension. The charge is sprayed on these
belts at 20,000 volts with a screen ar-
rangement. A device in the sphere takes
the charge off the belts, transferring it to
the sphere. Theoretically it should be
possible to reach a voltage of 3,000,000,
Professor Cork said, but so far the maxi-
mum obtained has perhaps been about
1,500,000 volts.
Projecting from the side of the sphere
to a balcony in the room is a large, hori-
zontal glass tube, seven feet long and
four inches in diameter. In this the posi-
tive ions are given their acceleration. The
tube is kept evacuated by means of a mer-
cury pump. Nine corona shields encircle
the tube in order to keep the field con-
stant. Inside the sphere is equipment for
heating a specially prepared filament
which gives off positive lithium ions. This
filament is mounted at the sphere end of
the evacuated tube. The ions are acceler-
ated by the very high voltage of the
sphere and strike the target at the other
end of the tube with an enormous veloc-
ity. When an ion smashes into the target
it has been found that nuclear transforma-
tions may occur, giving rise to entirely
different atoms than those of the elements
used. At the present time Professor Cork
is bombarding lithium with lithium. As
this element appears in nature, it is a
mixture of two isotopes of atomic weight
six and seven respectively, hence three
possible results of the bombarding present
themselves. The end products to be ex-
pected are alpha particles (helium nuclei)
and perhaps the newly discovered par-
ticles, neutrons and deuterons.
The products formed in the nuclear
collisions are at present detected by ob-
serving their range with a "Geiger
Counter." This is an arrangement of
ionization chamber and vacuum tube am-
plifier, such that a single alpha particle
entering the chamber will actuate a
counter in the output circuit of the am-
plifier. Thus a record of the total number
of particles arriving in any interval of
time is obtained. The instrument is so
sensitive that cosmic radiation moves the
pointer every so often and a radioactive
substance held close to the ionizing
chamber makes the pointer move at a
lively clip.
At the present time Professor Cork and
his assistant are setting up a "Wilson
Cloud Chamber" method of observing
the ionized particles and expect to put
it to use in a short time. This consists of
a chamber containing air and saturated
water vapor. In passing through air, the
alpha particle creates a multitude of new
ions. Now if the chamber is suddenly
expanded, vapor condenses on the ions
formed, leaving a trail which can be
photographed thru a transparent window
in the chamber. Two photographs are
taken simultaneously from different an-
gles, in order to give a three dimensional
picture of the path of the ion.
Measuring the voltage of the sphere
presented a variety of difficulties but they
have been overcome by using a substance
known as xylene for a resistance. Xylene
is a liquid having a very high resistance
and is contained in a long, thin, glass
tube which runs from the sphere to the
base of the pillar. A galvanometer meas-
ures the current through the resistance
and hence the fall of potential.
Great strides have been made by scient-
ists in laying bare the riddle of the atom.
Who knows but what the near future will
see further discoveries made which will
eventually lead to harnessing of the atomic
energy?

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Keeping water out in the rain
MASONRY WALLS made of brick, stone, or concrete have
long stood the test of time. But today, they can be made
even better with a coating of silicone water repellents.
These amazing materials prevent damaging rainwater
from entering the countless tiny pores or openings in
masonry structures.
When the water freezes after penetrating, it can
cause spalling—cracks off small pieces. And, if it seeps
all the way through to the inside of a building, paint
peels ... woodwork warps ... plaster stains and cracks.
Now, silicone water repellents provide the an-
swer. Brushed or sprayed on the surface, they line—
not seal—the pores in masonry. Even heavy rain driven
by hurricane winds cannot break through this invisible
raincoat... yet, because the pores are not sealed, mois-
ture from within can evaporate freely.
The people of Union Carbide produce silicones
for other uses, too... automobile and furniture polishes,
lubricants, electrical insulation, and new rubber-like
products ... all of which help bring more and better
things for all of us.

by Professor EARNEST BOYCE
... A tribute to the oldest Department
in the College of Engineering ...
In preparation for the 1953 Centennial
Anniversary of Engineering Education
at the University of Michigan, historical
data with regard to the College of Engi-
neering were compiled and published.
This record of the development of
engineering education at the University
reflects in an interesting way the develop-
ment and ever increasing dependence of
modern society on the knowledge and
skill of those who have a technical edu-
cation.
Engineering in 1853 reflected, as it
does at present, the socio-economic need
for persons with the knowledge and apti-
tude required to find solutions to engi-
neering problems of the time period con-
cerned. Industry, as we know it today,
was unknown in 1853, and the public
need for and interest in the then emerg-
ing engineering profession was limited
to the solving of problems confronting
the civil population from whence came
the name still applied to this branch of
engineering. The problems of 1853 were
those relating to the development of a
new land that was lacking in the trans-
portation facilities and other works of
internal improvement necessary to meet
the needs of a rapidly changing national
economy. New lands were being sub-
divided and a knowledge of land meas-
urement and mapping represented a major
area of public interest in technical edu-
cation. Then, as now, the University of
Michigan, responsive to an educational
need, provided the type of instruction
required to qualify its graduates to solve
the technical problems of that period.
Through the century of Civil Engineer-
Construction on the General Library Addition.
ing education at the University of Michi-
gan there has been a continuous reap-
praisal of the nature of the engineering
problems confronting the civil population
in the progressive development of the
environment in which we live.
Meanwhile, the growth and develop-
ment of manufacturing industry has
created an ever increasing demand for
men with a knowledge of the many ap-
plications of science to the development
and production of manufactured goods
While some have suggested that the early
civil engineering educational program was
the parent stem from which other fields
of engineering branched, this concept b
hardly borne out by fact.

At the pearly gates St. Peter checked
the golf pro. Question number two was,
"Have you ever violated the Lord's com-
mandments?"
The golf pro, ashamed but honest,
replied, "Yes, Sir. I once took the Lord"s
name in vain."
"Tell me what happened, son." Peter
said sympathetically.
"Well, I was all tied up for the Na-
tional Open after 53 holes of play. I
teed off on the last hole and landed in
the rough."
"Don't tell me," said Peter in horror,
"that you took our Lord's name in vain
because you drove into the rough."
"No, no! I took my two iron, hit the
green, but the ball rolled into a sand
trap."
"You didn't take the Lord's name in
vain just because you landed in a sand
trap?"
"No, Sir. I hit the ball out of the trap
into the water hole."
"Now, Son," Peter said, "you wouldn't
take the Lord's name in vain just be-
cause you landed in a water hazard."
"No, Sir. Matter of fact, my next

AND MARINE ENGINEERING
by JUDITH ROBINSON
In 1881, one year before the Technic had its beginning, a
young naval officer came from Annapolis to Ann Arbor as the
first instructor in Marine Engineering. Here are many of the in-
teresting developments as seen through the years, including
one of the outstanding naval tanks in the country.
The Establishment of the Department of
Naval Architecture and Marine Engi-
neering at the University of Michigan
Marine Engineering in its earliest form
was first taught here in 1881 when Morti-
mer E. Cooley, sent as a young naval
officer to teach Steam Engines and Marine
Engineering, joined the team of univer-
sity instructors. At that time Marine Engi-
neering was just an option branch of
the Mechanical Engineering Department.
In 1889, the College of Engineering alter-
ed the budget $2,000 in order to estab-
lish a full curriculum in Marine Engineer-
ing, and the course of Mechanical
Engineering was changed to Mechanical
Engineering and Iron Shipbuilding. This
curriculum assumed the heading of the
Department of Naval Architecture and
Marine Engineering in 1900 when Her-
bert C. Sadler from the University of
Glasgow, Scotland, joined the university
staff as a junior professor of Naval
Architecture and Marine Engineering. In
1904, the tank and all of it equipment,
entirely designed by Prof. Sadler, was in-
stalled, which officially inaugurated the
Department of Naval Architecture and
Marine Engineering.
Resume of the Instructors in
this Department
Mortimer E. Cooley came to the Uni-
versity of Michigan in 1881, a young
naval officer and graduate of Annapolis,
to teach Steam Engines and Marine Engi-
neering as head of the Mechanical Engi-
neering Department. Professor Cooley be-
came dean of the College of Engineering
in 1900, the time the Department of
N.A. and M.E. was first begun. That
same year, Herbert C. Sadler, graduate of
Glasgow University in N.A. and M.E.,
joined the department, contributing a
tremendous amount to the complete es-
tablishment of the department and to the
field of research. Herbert Sadler worked
in the Clyde Ship yards for several years
and then was appointed assistant profes-
sor of N.A. in Glasgow University be-
fore he accepted a position at the Univer-
sity of Michigan.
Prof. Sadler, after contributing in 1904
the complete plans for the naval tank, in-
cluding the towing car, became the first
chairman of the Dept. of N.A. and M.E.
During his stay in this university, Prof.
Sadler acted as consultant Naval Architect
to the U.S. Shipping Board which was
like the present-day Maritime Adminis-
tration. He was an expert on problems
of power and stability, and one of the
first men in the development of scientific
principles of ship form and resistance.
Sadler, during his professorship here,
wrote many papers presented to the So-
ciety of Naval Architects and Marine
Engineers covering such topics as: fluid
friction, steam lines, propeller design,
propeller position and efficiency, suction,
resistance, and many others.
In 1915, Edward M. Bragg, a graduate
of M.I.T., joined the university staff.
Prof. Bragg lent a great deal to present
theories of hull form and resistance. Rep-
resentative topics of the many papers he
presented to the S.N.A.M.E. are: model
propellor experiments (1924, 28, 30),
feather paddle wheels (1916), frictional
resistance (1926), etc.
In 1918, Anders Linblad joined the
department and taught the equivalent of
our present-day courses of NAll, 12,
13, and 132. (At that time, there was
no course equivalent to NA21.) Pro-
fessor Linblad came from a job in Cleve-
land, Ohio, wth the American Ship-
building Corporation and was giving a
short course in N.A. at Case School of
Applied Science. During his stay here.
Prof. Linblad was mainly interested in
tank testing and experimenting.
Professor Herbert C. Sandler became
dean of the College of Engineering in
1928, and Prof. Bragg became head of the
Dept. of N.A. and M.E. It was in this
year that Henry C. Adams II became a
professor in this department. Prof. Adams
contributed many technical papers to the
SNAME including such topics as the
study of rolling of ships (1938), mer-
chant marine personnel (1939), stability
of vessels after damage (1932), subdivi-
sion of ships (1942), etc. Among the
courses, Prof. Adams, together with Prof.
Baier, taught the course comparable to
present-day A137 which was then two
one-hour courses.
In June 1933, Prof. Linblad left the

Since its inception in 1916, this Michigan
curriculum has grown to become the best in the
nation.
Fig. I. Landing gear experiment is structure laboratory.
Aeronautical Engineering at the Uni-
versity of Michigan owes its inception
to the enthusiastic support of Professor
Herbert C. Sadler and Dean Mortimer E.
Cooley. Due largely to their efforts, the
first aeronautical engineering curriculum
offered in this country was established
here in 1916 under the direction of Felix
W. Pawlowski. The Aero Club, organ-
ized in 1911 by Professor Sadler, had
previously built a small wind tunnel in
West Engineering Building for model
tests and, with some advice from Wilbur
Wright, had constructed and flown a
man-carrying glider as a kite from the
hills outside Ann Arbor.
From these small but significant be-
ginnings the program of instruction and
research has continually expanded. Ed-
ward A. Stalker was added to the staff
in 1921, and in 1926 financial support
from the Guggenheim Foundation re-
sulted in the completion of a large wind
tunnel in the basement of East Engineer-
ing Building as well as the establishment
of a Guggenheim Professorship of ap-
plied aeronautics for a ten-year period.
The academic staff has continued to grow
in size and breadth to the present group
of twenty-four people.
Student enrollment has been consist-
ently strong in the under graduate pro-
gram and has sustained a steady growth
in the graduate program. A recent an-
alysis by the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology placed the University of
Michigan first among all educational in-
stitutions in this country in number of
aeronautical degrees granted annually
(B.S, M.S., Ph.D.) for the period 1949-
54. At the present time the Aeronautical

During his career he has been an engineer for Lockheed Air-

cal engineering at Iowa State College, and then head of the
department there from 1942 to 1946 when he began his teach-
ing career at Michigan. He is a member of the National Society

525 M.S. degrees, 2 Sc.D. degrees, 21
Ph.D. degrees, and 7 professional de-

dergraduate students and 62 graduate
students. Every major aircraft concern in
this country is staffed partially with aero-
nautical engineers from this University—
many of them in "top" positions.
growth and facility growth one finds a
fascinating picture of technical advances.
The "stick-wire-and fabric" aircraft of
the early nineteen hundreds evolved
steadily into the monocoque, metal-clad
aircraft of the nineteen thirties—pow-
ered by reciprocating engines of radial,
air-cooled design with greatly increased
power. These aircraft, in turn, were giv-
vertical takeoff and landing. Rotary-wing
aircraft, such as the helicopter, have im-
proved greatly in terms of performance,
reliability and public acceptance. In ad-
dition, the rapid development of the roc-
ket has brought into the aeronautical en-
gineering industry such projects as inter-
continental rockets and earth satellites.
The word "aeronautics" denotes flight
Fig. 2. Test section of supersonic wind tunnel.
Fig. 3. Propulsion laboratory test cell.
In 1935, the military services began
to send officers here for graduate study
in aeronautical engineering. This gradu-
ate program was augmented in 1946 by
the Air Force Guided Missiles program,
which has continued to date, and gradu-
ated 152 officers.
Statistics are sometimes interesting but
do not tell the complete story. Super-
imposed on this background of numerical
en greatly increased performance by the
development of the turbojet and turbo-
prop engine after the last World War.
Today, one finds a wide range of re-
search aircraft, military aircraft and com-
mercial aircraft employing rocket, ram-
jet, turbojet and turboprop propulsion.
The tremendous power and light weight
of these propulsion devices have opened
up many new design concepts—such as
in the atmosphere. The sensible atmo-
sphere, in terms of aerodynamic forces,
extends to at least 200 miles above the
earth's surface. This, literally, is the
region that the aeronautical engineer is
working in today. In addition, he is con-
cerned with projects extending from our
atmosphere to other atmospheres, such
as feasibility studies on rocket flights to
the moon.

Fig. 4. Instrumentation for analogue computer experiment.
This impetus of technological advance-
ment has been reflected in the curricular
and research programs. The undergrad-
uate curriculum is based upon a solid
background of fundamental work in the
areas of structures, aerodynamics, propul-
sion and instrumentation. The graduate
program allows increasing specialization
in one or more of these fields.
In aircraft structures the student applies
his basic knowledge of physics and engi-
neering mechanics to the analysis and de-
sign of light weight airframes. The pres-
ent aircraft laboratory in the basement
of East Engineering Building (See Fig.
1) is set up for both steady and dynamic
load experiments on a variety of aircraft
components. In addition, research appara-
tus is installed for the testing of aircraft
structures at elevated temperatures, cor-
responding to conditions generated by
supersonic flight in the atmosphere. The
aeroelastic problems related to flutter and
vibration are studies in detail.
Aerodynamics has been concerned pri-
marily with the study of external aero-
dynamic forces. The scope of this work
has expanded from the low-speed, sub-
sonic regime of the early days until it
now encompasses the analysis and testing
of aerodynamic forces through a wide
range of supersonic speeds. For example,
Fig. 2 shows testing in progress up to
Mach number four (four times the speed
of sound or approximately 3000 m.p.h.
at sea level) in the supersonic wind tun-
nel laboratory. Five wind tunnels are
currently in operation—two subsonic in
62
East Engineering Building and one sub-
sonic and two supersonic on the North
Campus. The course work covers the basic
theory of perfect fluids followed by
viscous and compressible fluid flow.
Propulsion courses deal with the in-
ternal flow problems of aircraft power-
plants. The performance and analysis of
the reciprocating engine, turbojet, turbo-
prop, ramjet and rocket are discussed in
addition to related problems concerned
with air inlets. The student builds upon
his work in aerodynamics to handle the
analysis of air flow with heat addition.
In Fig. 3 a ceramic-lined ramjet combus-
tion chamber is shown under test at wall
temperatures above 3000CF. Tests of this
type are conducted in the Aircraft Pro-
pulsion Laboratory on the North Camp-
us.
Instrumentation work for the under-
graduates is concerned with the analysis
of control systems, such as auto-pilot sys-
tems, on aircraft and includes an an-
alysis of control surface operating tech-
niques on the analogue computer. Fig. 4
shows a portion of the analogue computer
laboratory in East Engineering Building
with one of the recording drums on the
right. The broad field of instrumentation
includes measurement, communication
and control. This work is developed
thoroughly at the graduate level.
Research work by the academic and
research staff is currently underway in all
of the above fields, as well as related
work. One of the related fields is that of
upper atmosphere exploration, in which
a group has been active over the past
eleven years. High-altitude rocket firings
have been made at many locations, prob-
ing the upper atmosphere at altitudes of
80 miles or more in the determination of
pressure, density, temperature, and com-
position. Fig. 5 shows one of the research
rockets being prepared for firing. Se-
lected undergraduate and graduate stu-
dents are active throughout the research
program and make many valuable con-
tributions.

became head of the Department. It was
this year that Charles W. Spooner joined
the Mechanical Engineering Dept. and
then later transferred to the Marine Engi-
neering Dept. Prof. Spooner was a grad-
uate of Cornell and received his masters
in Mechanical Engineering at the Univer-
sity of Michigan.
In 1948, Professor Harry Benford, a
1940 University of Michigan alumnus,
Thus far in the history of this depart-
ment, there has been an excellent team of
instructors to impart their knowledge to
future naval architects and Marine engi-
neers.
The Building and Construction of
the Naval Tank
The naval tank, entirely designed by
the late Prof. Herbert C. Sadler, was
built in 1904. It was ordinarily built 300
feet long, 22 feet wide, and 10 feet deep.
Its sides and bottom are completely con-
crete, with the bottom arched and rein-
forced with expanded metal. A concrete
bracket runs along the side to carry the
rails for the towing car. At the South end
are filters through which the tank is filled
and a dry dock. At the end of the tank,
running a distance of 133 feet, is a
movable false bottom used for shoal water
tests. At the north end is the 7 5-horse-
power synchronous motor-generator which
supplies enough constant power to the
towing truck to move the car from 10 to
470 feet/minute in low gear and from
400 to 750 feet/minute in high gear.
In 1904, the last section of the tank
had to be housed in a shed. West Engi-
neering Building was made larger in
1908, and at that time 60 more feet, all
housed but boarded over to make room
for the Electrical Engineering lab, was
added. When the Electrical Engineering
lab was moved to East Engineering Build
ing in 1948, the tank was unboarded for
use. However, it was found to be default)
in construction, evidently padded by the
constructors back in 1908. The tank had
to be completely emptied, reconditioned,
and then the sides tarred before the full
360 feet of length could be used.
Models built in the early 1900's for
this basin was made of paraffin wax
with a small amount of beeswax. The
models were cut and faired by machine
after being cast from clay moulds. As
might be expected, a great deal of diffi-
culty was encountered with wax modeN
in that they constantly changed shape, and
thus had to be repaired or completely re-
built during extensive use. It was nor
until later that wooden models were usee
as they are at present.
Many industrial companies contrib
uted to the building of this naval tank
The Russel Wheel and Foundry Compan\
of Detroit contributed the towing car.
The Carnegie Steel Company contributed
the rails for the car; The General ElectrL
Company offered a special price for the
motors and generators; and the Standard
Oil Company contributed one ton of
paraffin wax for the building of the
models.
This model basin has tested everything
from a seven foot dinghy to a floating dry
dock. The tank has aided in the develop-
ment of barges, towboats, fireboats, U.S.
Shipping Board boats, submarines, yachts,
trawlers, cup defenders, and many other
commercial vessels.

broadening of the areas where technical
knowledge is needed. Hence, we may con-

the branching of the earlier field of civil

Professor Boyce has a distinguished
record in the fields of Civil Engineering
and Public Health. He received his B.S.
degree in C.E. from Iowa State College.
Subsequent training at Harvard University
earned him an M. S. degree in Sanitary
Engineering. He received his professor-
ship in 1934. In 1941 he became civilian
consultant for Army Water Supply. He

Report and he is also the author of nu-
merous articles on public health, especial-
ly water supply and disposal.
distinguished from that area of engineer-
ing still dedicated to the engineering an-
alysis of the problems that are of vital
concern to the civil population.
Prior to 1912 the civil engineering pro-
gram gave especial emphasis to the de-
sign of steel structures, principally
bridges, and to the problems of railroad
location and construction. It also had the
responsibility for many of the courses
serving all departments now forming the
Department of Engineering Mechanics.
With the organization of a separate De-
partment of Engineering Mechanics in
1912, there occurred a major change in
the Civil Engineering staff and in the
organization of the curricula offered. New
professors with years of engineering ex-
perience and practice were added to the
staff and the expanding field of civil en-
gineering was recognized by appointing
professors of structural, hydraulic, muni-
cipal and sanitary, and geodetic engi-
neering. Courses in highway engineering
were first offered in 1912 and a physical
testing laboratory to provide a state serv-
ice in the testing of highway construc-
tion materials was established.
In 1915 the University started an in-
structional program for state and county
road officials—a conference that has
grown during the forty-two years to the
recent Conference held in Grand Rapids
with attendance in excess of 900. Every
effort was made to orient the instructional
program into the fields of engineering
practice that then, as now, provide service
to the public in the planning, design, and
construction of highways, railways, water-
ways, buildings, bridges, dams, and the
many other structural facilities needed for
public works and industrial development.
The problems of sanitary and muni-
cipal engineering have attracted many
students into this field so essential to a
satisfactory way of life in a modern urban
community.
The nature of the civil engineer's work
requires that he not only have a broad
basic knowledge of the physical sciences,
but also that he be alert to the economic
and social significance of the permanent
works that he plans and builds.

And yet, sans the straps, her top sticks like a leach.
Don't credit her shoulders, her front so sublime,
Adhesive or thumbtacks, it's science this time.
The lads in the lab have abandoned old tech,
And girders and tunnels and roll of the deck,
To take to some drafting that's more fun than bridges;
They've cantilevered all of Milady's cute ridges.
So all hail the strapless, the news in years,
Coming straight from the space twixt the engineer's ears.
She'll dance and she'll swim or she'll run a fast lap,
Quite strapless, quite poised, and without a mishap.

Controlling floods and blowing suds and never reaching

When you want fun your tastes don't run to graphs and

But the the "Pub" and "Clover Club" and ball-room

You make surveys of waterways, and plan for irrigation
But HL,0 to gin that's sloe you add in moderation.
With stress and strains you ascertain the ways to make

Then spend the night till broad daylight in making dames

Oh, Engineers have hairy ears, I find them most endearing.

artist unknowingly has improved things.
The interplane struts are not stream-lined
as shown in the sketch, but are built up
of four angle irons tied with lattice work;
the idea is, no doubt, to prevent the craft
from running away, for these resistance
producing elements will act as excellent
brakes. The resilient landing gear is also
to be noted. It consists, as can be seen, of
six conventionally designed tennis court
rollers, the large bearing areas of which
Fig. V. What "Pure Art" has to offer.
The grandeur of the scheme is sublime.
But again the foolish questions. What
about the propellers, whose tips will be
revolving, if our arithmetic erreth not, at
the snail-like velocity of 5,500 miles per
hour? Would not the "cavitation" which
occurs in the flight of shells going at half
that speed, destroy any useful aerodynam-
ical properties the screws might otherwise
have? Indeed would there be any pro-
peller there to cavitate, after the centrifu-
gal forces had finished tugging at the
hub? Again, why make the gap chord
ratio of the wings one-third when it is
this condition that blanketing effect of
one plane on the other is extremely
large?
Civil engineering practice seems to
have hypnotized the inventor, when it
came to the design of some parts. The
are no doubt intended to prevent the col-
lapse of the earth when the Guazy wing-
ed creature flits thereto. But why
shouldn't the inventor be solicitous of the
earth? He is a mining engineer.
Finally we must observe what pure art
has to offer us in the way of solutions to
our aeronautical problems. Witness Fig.
V, where an aerial navy sweeps ethereal
space, according to the vision of the ar-
tist.
Surely we might here have raised our
hopes high in expectation of the radical
and the dreamy. Not so! Bound by tra-
dition to the earth's surface, he still ad-
heres to Marine practice,—yes, to shapes
and outlines that would have delighted
Norse seamen. We take note in particular
of the graceful stern that is just disap-
pearing at the right of the sketch. No, it
must after all be a prow, according to
the direction of the streaming flag, and
the guess that the gas pipe there visible
is the motor exhaust must be revised to
read fog-horn.
Even the size of the propellers and
control surfaces indicate a naval prejudice.
Perhaps the creator expects to make them
effective by spraying water or molasses
in advance of the craft. Although water
wings never needed struts to support
them, those of the aeroplane do, unfor-
tunately,—but then imagination is an
essential factor in the interpretation of
art.
It may have occurred to you to wonder
just what relation the foregoing descrip-
tions bear to the title of this article,
"Absolute Safety in Aircraft.'' Simply
this: Our point is proven now that ue
have shown one or more types of aircraft
which are absolutely safe. Let us add that
these are safe; 100 per cent so. They can
be subject to no accident while in the air
for the reason they will never get there.
If they get off the ground at all, they
will go only so far as they can be lifted
by some suitable hoisting mechanism.
At this point the aeronautical engineer
gives up the question, as the problem
now becomes one of crane design, and
must therefore be handed over to the
department on hoisting and conveying
machinery. We have no concern as to how
they will treat the problem.
We might add, however, that if the
patent officials had any voice in the mat-
ter, there is little doubt but that they
would recommend that such aerial atroci-
ties be hoisted up to a considerable height,
conveyed to the middle of the Atlantic,
and deposited there with an acceleration
of thirty-two and two tenths feet per
second.
"Easy to pick flaws," someone says;
"Our commonest conveniences were once
ridiculous." Quite true, and it may be so
again. It is quite within the realm of
possibility that the most valuable contri-
butions to aeronautics may come from
men of other fields. B*ut then, remember,
we have merely pointed out for the bene-
fit of kindly doubters that there are ab-
solutely safe aircraft.

How did you do on the problem in-

ships approach each other at a rate of 9
m.p.h. If they are 25 miles apart they will

at a rate of 186,000 miles per second, the
quantum will travel 1,860,000,000 miles.
In a few hours the quantum has traveled
as far as the earth will travel in 3 years.
Did you get an equation for the two

That was actually rather simple so it

both are still in motion and all collisions

A chemist has four unknown com-

antiseptic, and has an acid dissociation
constant logarithm of —9-89. The two
unknowns are dumped into the first men-
tioned unknown. The mixture is heated
for a few hours at 250°F. and then cool-
ed to room temperature. The chemist then
applies a non-standard qualitative an-

'WHISKERS' USED TO STUDY FORCES
BETWEEN ATOMS
One of modern science's oddities—
highly pure and perfect metal crystals
known as "'whiskers"—are enabling scien-
tists at the Westinghouse Research Lab-
oratories in Pittsburgh, Pa. to gain new
insight into the enormous forces which
bind atoms together.
In a paper delivered during the seventh
New York meeting of the American As-
sociation for the Advancement of Science
at Hotel Martinique on December 29,
Dr. R. L. Eisner, Westinghouse research
physicist, described a new technique for
evaluating these forces by measuring the
tensile strength of whiskers of iron and
silicon.
"In whiskers, a metal exists in a perfect
condition," Dr. Eisner said. "In contrast,
any ordinary piece of metal contains
countless millions of structural imperfec-
tions. Under stress, it is these imperfec-
tions which govern how and when the
metal will break. They mask any attempt
to measure the much larger forces which
hold the metal atoms themselves together.
"By conducting tensile tests on whisk-
ers, where these imperfections do not
exist, we can pull the individual atoms far
enough apart, without breaking, to get
a measure of the interatomic forces. This
enables us, for the first time, to check
modern theories of interatomic forces."
In Dr. Eisner's whisker experiments,
only a small force—less than one hun-
dredth of an ounce—is required to pull
the average whisker apart. This force,
which must be controlled and measured
with unusual accuracy, is obtained by a
light-weight pendulum about 12 feet
long. The whisker is "clamped" between
the bob of the pendulum and a special
"take-up" screw. As the screw is tight-
ened, the whisker pulls the pendulum
from its vertical position. Each millionth
of an ounce of pull displaces the handling
pendulum exactly the same amount—
about one ten-thousandth of an inch.
The stretch of the tiny whisker is
measured by reflecting a beam of light
from flat optical mirrors attached to the
clamps at each end of the whisker, to
form an "interference pattern." As the
whisker stretches, the mirrors move and
cause changes in the pattern similar to
the changing "rainbow" colors seen in
soap bubbles or thin film of oil. These
changes are electronically amplified and
analyzed to disclose the amount of
stretch. The technique accurately meas-
ures changes in whisker length down to
less than one millionth of an inch.
"Our experiments reveal considerable
data about interatomic forces," Dr. Eisner
said. "We have found that, freed of the
limitation imposed by impurities and im-
perfections, these forces give iron a
strength of more than half a million
pounds per square inch.
"Whereas in ordinary steel the imper-
fections cause it to flow and deform at
one-tenth its ultimate strength, we have
found no such "plastic" deformation
when interatomic forces only are in-
volved. Even the elastic limit of 'soft'
metals such as tin in the perfect struc-
tural state is at least ten times the maxi-
mum in the best steels in common use to-
day.
"We think we are beginning to under-
stand the origin of these interatomic
forces which 'glue' atoms so tightly to
one another. Our plan is to try our experi-
ments on the very simplest metal atoms
in order to gain additional data which, we
hope, will verify our theoretical conclu-
sions. Such an understanding, we feel, is
a necessary first step toward someday
making use of these enormous forces in
the new and better metals of the future."
THE AMAZING DOORLESS DOOR
The slowly moving downward flow of
air which forms the Doorless Door acts as
an insulating wall and protects the interior
of any building from all outside weather
conditions. It effectively replaces the tra-
ditional type of door, swinging or re-
volving. Thus it alleviates the main en-
trance of the building of congested cus-
tomer traffic and it permits shoppers bur-
dened with packages to leave or enter
through an unobstructed doorway, with-
out shoving or pushing. The Doorless
Door is a unique step in increasing shop-
ping comfort. This Swiss engineering de-
velopment has been created by Sulzer
Bros, of New York.
The passerby finds an element of in-
trigue in the "Doorless Door" store. It
brings the sales counter closer to the win-
dow shopper, thereby creating a definite
influence towards impulse buying. In-
creases in sales ranging from 10 to 20Cr
have been indicated by a number of
European stores now equipped with this
type of installation.

neering achievement. Banks, supermar-
kets, showrooms, office buildings and all
industrial organizations with a heavy flow
of traffic are finding that the advantages
of the Sulzer Doorless Door have favor-
ably influenced sales in addition to
streamlining traffic problems.
How It Functions
During business hours, the Swiss engi-
neering development is operated by a
series of overhead nozzles located in the
ceiling grille through which a curved
beam of air is sprayed, falling in layers
outward and downward. The air sucked
through a floor grating that runs the full
length of the entrance is carried through
a heating or cooling unit (depending
upon season) after being filtered and
cleaned. It is then moved through ducts
to the ceiling and recirculated. The filters
catch all dirt, dust, grime, as well as in-
sects—and prevent them from entering
the building. Waste papers, cigarette
butts, and other small particles are col-
lected in a pit under the suction grating
from where they are periodically flushed
away. The nozzles are adjustable and the
velocity of the ducts can be changed
manually or automatically to meet the
variable weather conditions.
Eliminated Drafts
The Doorless Door positively eliminates
drafts. Research shows that the breeze
created by the movement of air will not
disturb a hair on one's head nor will it
ever cause madam's skirts to ride up . . .
the breeze won't even ruffle a feather.
NAVY TO SET UNIVERSAL DIGITAL
OPERATIONAL FLIGHT
Sylvania Electronic Products, Inc. is
developing UDOFT—the first Universal
Digital Operational Flight Trainer—
under contract for more than a million
dollars with the U.S. Naval Training De-
vice Center, Port Washington, N.Y., a
field activity of the Office of Naval Re-
search, it was announced today.
This program is under the joint spon-
sorship of the U.S. Air Force and the
Department of the Navy.
UDOFT is based on six years of basic
research performed by the Moore School
of Electrical Engineering, University of
Pennsylvania, under the direction of Mor-
ris Rubinoff, under contract with the U.S.
Naval Training Device Center.
In this operational flight trainer, the
pilot sits in an actual airplane cockpit, as
he would in flight. But his controls and
instruments are connected with floor-to-
ceiling banks of computing and other
electronic equipment next to the plane
section. With the cockpit canopy closed,
all the trainee can see are the instruments
and controls with which he would oper-
ate the plane in actual flight. Although
the cockpit itself does not move, the elec-
tronic "brain" simulates flight by setting
appropriate readings on the instruments.
The trainee's teacher has a duplicate set
of instruments and controls at the com-
puter panel, from which he can determine
what the trainee is doing. He can also in-
troduce new conditions—engine failure,
air turbulence, and storms, for example—
which the electronic "brain" translates
into appropriate readings on the cockpit
instruments, and which the trainee must
meet through the proper use of his
"stick," throttles, and other controls. How
well he accomplishes this is shown by
the changed instrument readings which
the electronic "brain" has altered after
calculating the effects of his actions.

Since the photocell is capable of de-

great accuracy, it could form the heart
of an automatic navigation system em-

Two spaced photo-cells could be used
as range-finders. The cells could detect
the flash of artillery fire in the distance,
accurately measure the direction to the
light, whereupon the intersection of these
lines of direction would pin-point the
position of the enemy.
The extreme compactness of the new
photocell would make possible the de-

small enough to mount on a finger in the
manner of a ring. Blind telephone op-
erators could then be guided to the right
location on the switchboard by a signal
transmitted from the cell to their ear-

VANGUARD PUSHER
A powerful new General Electric rocket
engine, designated the X405, will de
liver a thrust of over 27,000 pounds when

its intial 36 miles of flight toward outer
space.
Burning a hydrocarbon fuel and liquid
oxygen, the X405 rocket engine will
have accelerated the Vanguard rocket to
a speed of 4,000 miles an hour, or more
than a mile a second at burnout.
Advanced components, including i
turbopump and thrust chamber, are cred-
ited with making possible the long-dura-

team of specialists—has been developed
jointly by The Babcock &amp; Wilcox Com-
pany and The Bailey Meter Company.
By means of "sensing" elements linked
to analog scanners, the system can probe
hundreds of different boiler locations. At
the touch of a button, it begins gather-
ing such data as temperature, pressure and
gas composition. Complex electronic de-
vices, operating without human guidance,
then sort the information, supplement it
with pre-set figures, and punch it in code
on continuous tape.
Tape readings are transmitted by tele-
type to New York City, where B&amp;W has
a large electronic computer. Translated
automatically into code suitable for com-
puter use, the information is processed
mathematically and transmitted back to
the boiler site for application by en-
gineers and technicians.
The new system has been developed to
help engineers determine quickly and
economically such boiler problems as
sources of heat losses, the most efficient
types of fuels, and when and where to
remove combustion waste deposits.
In future tests, the system will be ap-
plied not only to boilers, but to a broad
range of equipment used in conjunction
with them. The system may shed new
light, for example, on the combined op-
erating efficiency of turbines and auxiliary
equipment used to produce and distribute
electric power.
F-I04A STARFIGHTER
America took its first look recently at
the world's fastest combat plane—Lock-
heed's new ultrasonic F-104A Starfighter,
demonstrated at the U. S. Air Force Jet
Center in Palmdale, California.
Flying on razor-blade wings, the USAF
F-104A is a spectacular day-and-night
fighter, powered by one of the world's
most powerful jet engines, the new Gen-
eral Electric J-79.
Its speed in climb is equal to its speed
in straight-and-level flight. But true top
speed has not been disclosed.
Operational altitude for the aeronauti-
cal bolt of lightning is the upper strato-
sphere.
The F-104A is the ship described by
Gen. Nathan F. Twining, Air Force chief
of staff, as "the most advanced plane of
its type ever developed."
Showing for the first time its here-
tofore secret configuration, the lance-like
Starfighter flies on thin, straight wings—
almost knife-sharp—measuring only iy2
feet from fuselage to tip. The fuselage is
54 feet, 9 inches long.
The wing's leading edge is so keen that
a felt covering is used to protect ground
crewmen when the plane is not flying.
Foremost features of the new air
weapon include:
1. Most powerful jet engine, thrust
per pound, yet developed.
2. First downward ejection system for a
production jet fighter.
3. A T-shaped "flying tail."
Optimum speed and maneuverability
were given the fighter by trimming out
all possible airframe weight and striv-
ing for simplicity rather than complex-
ity of operation.
Weighing less than any operational jet
combat plane—the F-104A is a light-
weight fighter in everything except strik-
ing power.
The T-shaped empennage is called a
"flying tail" because the entire surface of
the horizontal stabilizer moves. There is
no elevator on the thin stabilizer, which
is located almost at the top of a high,
swept-back vertical fin. At top speed the
Starfighter's new J-79 turbojet with after-
burner develops half of its thrust as a
ramjet—in which compression of air en-
tering the engine is increased by the sheer
force resulting from very high speed.
In order to take advantage of the space
within the fuselage for installation of
equipment, the Starfighter's stubby wings
do not extend through the fuselage as a
single structural unit but are joined separ-
ately to the fuselage.
The wings have 10 degrees of negative
dihedral—which means that they slant
downward slightly—and both the lead-
ing and trailing edges taper toward the
center line of the wing. Wing tips are
squared off. The wing is located nearly
two-thirds of the way back on the fuse-
lage.
The downward ejection system, first
of its kind to be installed in a produc-
tion jet fighter, adds safety by removing
the possibility of a pilot colliding with
any part of the airplane following ejec-
tion.
To eject himself the pilot has only to
pull a handle to start an automatic chain
of events: (a) the cockpit is depressur-
ized and the stick pops forward out of
the way; (b) the parachute shoulder har-
ness snaps onto the pilot, his legs art
pulled close to the body by "mechanical
straps," and ankle clamps hold the feet in
place; (c) an explosive cartridge releases
the escape hatch and jettisons the seac
downward and outward; (d) the pilot's
seat belt unsnaps, freeing him from his
seat, and at a pre-set altitude the para-
chute opens.
Dimensions of the Starfighter are:
height 13 feet, 6 inches; length 54 feet.
9 inches; span, wingtip to wingtip, 21
feet, 11 inches.

"Glowing wafer" of light (electroluminescence) sheds illumination on the faces of
three Westinghouse scientists who helped to develop it. Left to right: Dr. Willi
Lehmann (University of Brunswick, Germany); Dr. Henry F. Ivey (University of Georgia,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology); and R. W. Wollentin (Rutgers University).
The Light
With no Third Dimension
A new source of light is nearing
practicality. Called electrolumines-
cence, it comes from a flat surface.
By the twist of a knob, you can
change the brightness, or even the
color, of a room.
Since electric lighting first became
practical, only three basically dif-
ferent light sources have achieved
widespread use—incandescent, fluo-
rescent, and gas-discharge lamps.
Now a fourth basic type—electro-
luminescence—is nearing practical-
ity. With fewer theoretical limita-
tions than any of its predecessors,
it promises to revolutionize lighting
and become a practical light source
of the future.
In an incandescent lamp, light
comes from a single point. In a
fluorescent lamp (form of gas-
discharge), light comes from a
straight line. In electroluminescence,
light comes from an area or flat sur-
face. Electroluminescence is light
emission from phosphor powders em-
bedded in an insulator, excited by
an a-c field.
Westinghouse engineers gave the
first practical demonstration of this
new light source. They lighted an
entire room with flat electrolumi-
nescent panels on the ceiling and
three walls. These panels were one-
foot-square flat glass plates about
as thick as a window pane and coated
with a plastic containing the phos-
phor. They were topped off by an
aluminum conducting coating.
Hooked up to a source of power,
these plates had a brightness of 100
foot lamberts in their present stage
of development.
Since some phosphors have more
than one emission band, the color
and brightness of electroluminescent
lighting can be changed by varying
the frequency. It is possible to con-
trol the color of a room, and bright-
ness too, simply by twisting a knob.
Besides supplying ordinary light,
this new light source has other fas-
cinating possibilities. Just one is
"picture framing" television. An
electroluminescent cell might replace
the conventional cathode-ray tube
in such a set.
Westinghouse engineers, under the
supervision of E. G. F. Arnott
(Princeton '28), developed electro-

GEORGE GRANGER BROWN
REQUIESCAT IN PACE
The residence at 1910 Hill Street, and the office at 255 West Engineering
Building were unmistakably quiet and somber that particular Monday, August
26th. George Granger Brown, consulting engineer, educator, and fine human
being, had passed into the life beyond.
Born September 3, 1896, Dean Brown had led a full and most interesting
life. The Dean received his M.S. in Chemical Engineering from New York
University in 1917. The same year saw his marriage to Dorothy B. Martin.
Later, the young couple moved West, and George received his M.S.E. at the
University of Michigan in 1922, followed by his Ph.D. in 1924. The late Dean
worked in industry between the years of 1917 and 1920. He became an in-
structor in 1920 and was raised to the position of full professor in 1931.
Between the years of 1942 and 1951, George Brown headed the Department
of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering. The last year mentioned saw the
climax to a fine career. Department Head Brown was appointed Dean of the
College of Engineering, and also Chairman of the Engineering Research
Council.
The author of four books and countless articles in technical and pro-
fessional journals, Dean Brown was a member or officer of many organiza-
tions, and received a large number of awards for his many contributions to
science.
The University and the world have lost a great man by name of George
Granger Brown.

by Professors F. N. MENEFEE and R. D. BRACKETT
Two Emeritus Profs. Relax in Front of the Blazing Fireplace,
Reminiscing on the "Days of Old."
Well here we are; two retired pro-
fessor, supposedly lounging around,
eating when we want to, sleeping late in
the morning, rejoicing over our entry into
the realm of no eight o'clocks; going fish-
ing, now and then doing some chore
that had been put off from time to time
throughout previous years, reading the
obituaries each morning to see if we are
still alive, in short, completely free of ob-
ligations, time deadlines and so on, and
in fact by some, we are sure, it is thought,
that time for us now drags heavily along,
and by others that we live the life of
Riley.
We are reminded of what Shirley
Smith, retired vice-president and business
manager of the University said at a ban-
quet over which he was presiding shortly
after his retirement. "I'm not here by
choice; I'm supposed to be retired but
from the number of jobs that I'm having
laid on my doorstep I can't see much dif-
ference between before and after retire-
ment except that I used to get paid for
what I did. I had planned to spend the
first three years of my retirement cleaning
my attic but almost a year has slipped by
and I haven't had a chance yet to start
on it."
And so it is with us. Albert W. Hil-
burger, Article Editor of the Technic,
called up and wanted an historical outline
of the period when we were faculty ad-
visors. We wouldn't know Mr. Hilburger
if we met him in the Arch, and we don't
think he would know us. Mr. Hilburger's
father came back to the June '57 reunion
and we had the pleasure of meeting him
at the Engineers breakfast. But we would
never have been professors if we had
not admired and encouraged young men
to be original, take a chance and tackle
things out of the routine. We strongly
suspect that Col. H. W. Miller was ap-
proached first, he having been chairman
of the Advisory Board for many years;
the Col. is, or was retired too, but he was
retreaded and put back on the drawing
department staff for a few additional
miles. Then too, the Colonel was once an
army man and he hasn't forgotten how to
"pass the buck." *
We did not tell Mr. Hilburger how
little we knew about the history of the
Technic from the early 30's till recent
years. We did as all successful professors
do. We talked around the subject sparring
for time, saying yes, but hanging an es-
cape clause on it in case time or some-
* So was I but I didn't have anyone to
whom I could pass the job.

Hilburger asked for. Then we sent out a
questionnaire to old Technic Staff mem-
bers whose addresses were recorded in the
Dean's file. (Some are not, and some that
are there, turned out to be incorrect.)
Out of the replies we got information as
to what was going on in the minds of the
staff in their active Technic and student
days, much of which was not disclosed
to us as Advisory Board members in our
monthly meetings with the staff. There
are as many different definitions of His-
tory as there are men who have taken
pains to record their definitions. We hope
the following is at least an approach to
what Mr. Hilburger wanted.
We herewith chronologically list the
names of those staff members from which
we got replies. The addresses of some
were not in the Dean's file and some
of our letters were returned for lack of
correct address. Replies came from:

Technic Staff Responsible to
Engineering Faculty Board
The Michigan Technic has a long and
honorable record of autonomy. It got
into financial trouble in the early 1930's,
but they .were "in good company." They
bailed themselves out too, thus justifying
the opinion of the late Dean Coo ley and
the faculty advisory Board that they were
a group capable of running their affairs
with a minimum of patrimonious care.
Sometime about the turn of the century
the University ruled that there be a Board
of Control of Student Publications, with
a provision that a publication getting into
financial trouble could under some cir-
cumstances draw on the common treasury
for help. One by one other student publi-
cation organizations have been gathered
together in and under this Board. This
action was unusual because the organiza-
tiorr°itself ran into financial difficulties
which they could not or did not surmount.
The Technic was opposed to being in-
cluded and was upheld by Dean Cooley
and the Engineering Faculty. About 1943
another attempt was made by the adminis-
tration to bring the Technic under the
Board in Control of Student Publications,
but based on its record, and with the as-
sistance of Dean Brown and the Faculty
dvisory Board of the Engineering College
it is still on their own and will probably
remain so as long as the Technic staff
with the advice and counsel of the Faculty
Advisory Board, can publish a magazine
of credit to the Engineering College and
to the University.
The Depression Debt
As far as is known to us the Technic
was enjoying the seeming prosperity that
pervaded the country in the 1920's, but
following the October 1929 shock to all
business, the Technic was constantly strug-
gling to survive throughout the 1930's
with a spill over into the 1940 war years.
D. J. Carr, 1933, vividly remembers "We
were always short of money. I certainly
hope that money and circulation are not
the same overwhelming problems that
they were 25 years ago."
To begin with, local advertising ac-
counts shrunk, the circulation went down,
bad debts increased, and before the staff
realized that the condition was not tem-
porary, they were $1500 (some say
$1800) in debt; and to make matters
worse, printing prices started going up
in the middle or late thirties.
Details regarding the debt are lacking.
Robert L. Taylor, '36 "had no first hand
knowledge of it." He advised that he only
knew "what I heard from others—that
certain pre-1932 administration had failed
to keep costs in line with revenues and
the Ann Arbor Press extended credit to
them. I also heard stories of salaries or
commissions to top staff members in the
late twenties." We didn't have the "blan-
ket tax" that most of the other E. C.
M. A. publications had and were quite
proud of the fact that we were able to
make money despite this." Our interpre-
tation of this statement is that the Tech-
nic's income balanced operation expenses
with a little over to apply on the debt.
The Technic had become a member
of the Engineering College Magazine As-
sociation and through it and from other
sources, they knew that some engineering
colleges subsidized their students maga-
zine. With faculty advisor consent the
Technic staff tried to get a blanket tax
tied to the engineering student tuition.
The faculty refused to approve this plan,
but a token scheme of assistance was de-
vised by the Engineering College taking
a paid full page advertisement in each
issue. In this manner each department
got publicized once a year and the Technic
got paid for the ad. The agreement re-
quired the Technic to mail a copy of each
issue to a certain number of high school
libraries. This latter requirement adver-
tised the College and increased the cir-

SUSPENSION
Just What Makes These New Type
Automobile Suspensions So Good?
Ever ride on a magic carpet? Perhaps
not, but you can still get that "riding
on air" feeling when you go for a spin in
the Cadillac Eldorado Brougham (with
a brand new air-suspension system) or a
Packard (with the fairly recent torsion bar
suspension system).
Engineers and owners alike agree that
these two systems (along with Chrysler
Corp. torsion-aire) give you a much bet-
ter ride than the traditional type suspen-
sion system with coil springs at the front
wheels and leaf springs at the rear wheels.
Proponents of the two new systems feel
they have overcome many of the problems
facing the traditional type systems. One of
these problems is that the more passen-
gers in the car the "mushier" the ride.
This is because as more weight is added
the springs are compressed and conse-
quently they can't flex their metal muscles.
Let's see why engineers behind the new
systems feel they have solved this and
other problems.
Like the magic carpet mentioned the
Eldorado Brougham actually does ride on
air ( and not just the air in the tires). It
is the first air-suspension system to be used
in a passenger car and actually does use
a set of unique air springs.
The basis for the air-suspension sys-
tem is four-independent air domes located
at each corner of the car to replace the
usual set of springs. Beneath each air
dome is a tough rubber diaphram into
which fits a bullet-like piston. Since the
body of the air dome is fastened to the
car frame and the piston to the axle or
22
wheel support, the air in the dome acts
as a "spring" .between the frame and axle.
The air pressure for the system is main-
tained by an electric pump connected to
the car's generator.
The system isn't as simple as that, how-
ever. The "brains" behind this simple be-
ginning is quite complete and somewhat
complicated. The "brains" include three
levelizers: one for each of the two rear
air domes and one which serves the front
end air domes through a system of check
valves.
Each of the levelizers has a mechanical
valve which is operated by an arm and a
link that react to the up and down move-
ments of the frame and axle. In this man-
ner air can be pumped into each dome to
provide a level, bump-free ride.
Another feature goes into operation
when any of the four doors opens and,
by means of an electrical interlock, starts
the master control. The master control
then overrides the levelizers and takes
control of the air flow in and out of the
domes. Through this master unit the
slightest change in car weight caused by
people getting in or out can be controlled
within a fraction of an inch. The result is
that no matter how the Eldorado Broug-
ham is loaded or unloaded it's roof will
always be just 55.5 inches above the road.
Opponents of the system raise doubts
on such points as the difficulty of prevent-
ing leaks, the tendency of the air in the
system to change volume, the space re-
quired, and the cost.
Cadillac counters with a report that the
system will hold air easily for several
months and the rubber diaphrams are ex-
pected to last indefinitely. Even if the
system did leak slightly after several
months of disuse it wouldn't make any
difference they say. When the key was
turned on it would simply "pump itself
up off its haunches."
At the same time Cadillac engineers
point out that since the distance from
wheel to frame is always constant, it is
possible to design the underpinning of
the car to give top performance instead
of gearing it to achieve average per-
formance under a variety of loads.
Now for a means of comparison let's
examine the torsion bar suspension sys-
tem which first appeared in the 1955-56
Packard and later in the 1956-57 Chrysler
Corp. cars. Again, as in air suspension,
torsion bars completely replace the tradi-
tional spring setup.
The operation of a torsion bar itself is
much the same as the ordinary leaf spring.
In the same manner that the leaf spring
bends under a load and then returns to its
normal position. It is this "twist" spring-
ing that Packard has utilized in their sus-
pension system.
In the Packard, a one inch steel rod—
the torsion bar—runs the full length of
the car, front wheel to back wheel. The
connection at each end is a steel arm
with the front end arm extending out-
ward and rear arm extending inward.
These arms are what transmit the twisting
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Compensator Bar
force to the bar when the wheels go up
or down. Thus when the front wheels go
up (as in hitting a bump) the bar is
twisted and a downward force on the
rear wheels results. To visualize this think
of the car sitting on a garage hoist. If
you give one wheel an upward push the
other wheel on the same side will go
down. That is what permits Packard to
give an easy ride over rough roads and
bumps.
The torsion-bar system also provides a
constantly level body regardless of the
load in the car. For this operation Pack-
ard has what it calls a "load compensa-
tor." All it consists of is an additional
short torsion bar on each side near the
rear of the car. The load compensator
is connected to the main torsion bar by
means of a gear box and is operated by an
electric motor. In operation it works like
this. If a 200 pound load is added to the
rear seat the torque arm would twist (or
windup) the main torsion bar along its
whole length, including the center section
where the electric motor switch is located.
The motor, through a built-in delay, waits
six seconds before unwinding the two
smaller torsion bars and at the same time
causing the main torsion bars to unwind
and raise the car to its normal height. The
built-in delay is necessary to keep the com-
pensator from operating every time the
car hits a bump.
As proof of how good torsion bars are,
Packard engineers like to slam a sedan
across a diagonal railroad track with the
doors on the "ajar" latch. A crossing
ferocious enough to pop open the glove
compartment on most cars results in only
a few slight clicks with the Packard. Don't
believe it? They say try it.
Packard has made one exception pos-
sible for the leveling device, however.
The reason is that when you get a flat
tire it is quite exasperating trying to use a
bumper jack with the levelizer in opera-
tion, mainly because as one end goes up
so does the other. For this situation Pack-
ard has placed a "flat time switch" under
the dash which will cut out the levelizer.
How do the two systems, torsion bars
and air suspension, compare? It's hard to
say, but Consumers Report says, "Most
engineers feel that a form of self-leveling
torsion bar suspension will be simpler and
less prone to give trouble." On the other

Barry Peebles is a Sophomore in Sci-
ence Engineering. Writing for the
Technic is a "natural" for him, since at
one time he had decided to study journal-
ism. Along this line he was editor of the
Blissfield (Michigan) High School paper
for two years, has written a number of
articles for a daily newspaper; attended a
journalism course at Northwestern Uni-

At present, Barry hasn't yet decided
which field of engineering he will even-

AN ENGINEER
Some Interesting Points For a
Budding Engineer.
The selection one one's life work is a
difficult decision to make, and
it is unfortunate that one must decide
so early in life with very little train-
ing or experience to guide him. With
all the publicity in the past few years on
the need for engineers, many young men
and women have selected engineering,
and in the next decade many more will be
selecting engineering as their life's work.
In most high schools today many more
boys and girls are able to continue their
education due to our great national up-
grading of people in all classes of our so-
ciety, and an amazing number of these
youngsters, particularly boys, are planning
to follow a course leading to a degree in
engineering. When asked their rea-
sons for becoming engineers, the usual
answers are, "They make a lot of money",
or "It is a good job", "You have to be
good in math and you will succeed." Un-
fortunately, even after four or five years
of training, many engineering graduates
do not have much better reasons for be-
coming engineers, although their answers
may be somewhat polished and slightly
more glamorized.
What Is Expected of An Engineer
If your selection is engineering, you
should at least have a reasonable idea of
what an engineer is expected to do when
he goes out into industry to sell himself to
an employer. He is expected to work, and,
after a short indoctrination with the com-
pany, he is expected to carry his share
of the burden. Not only is he expected
to make enough money for the company
to justify his salary, but he must also be
able to exceed this amount by a consider-
able percentage so the company can make
a profit on his employ. He must always
keep in mind that if the company does not
make a reasonable profit on him at the
end of the year, it will not be too long
before the company goes out of business
and he, out of a job.
A Look at Placement
It is true that starting salaries for in-
experienced graduate engineers are high,
in fact probably higher than for any other
professional group at the present time.
With average or slightly better than aver-
age grades, the senior of an engineering
school usually has a number of job of-
ferings prior to actually receiving his
degree. This is certainly on the credit
side of the ledger when one considers his
life's work. A company will hire an in-
experienced engineer although it fully
realizes he will not be able to hold his
own for the organization for some time to
come.
Many companies, particularly larger
concerns, will take the beginning engineer
on face value alone, and will allow him
to seek his own level of achievement. The
company will place him within its or-
ganization, and he will be given very
little to do but find a job to his liking. If
he is content with doing very little, he
will stay just about where he started and
will not advance far technologically or
financially. However, if he shows his
capabilities and has the qualities the com-
pany wants, he will be helped along both
technologically and financially.
This, however, is an expensive kind of
screening, and can be used only by very
large organizations. Smaller companies
can not afford this type of screening, so
they devise other methods to employ and
hold a young engineer. Some of the meth-
ods are (1) part time work if schedules
and locations permit, (2) summer em-
ployment in engineering departments,
(3) cooperative training programs, and
(4) programs such as that which the

panies, employs. Littel's program of-
fers training in many areas of engi-
neering through talks by leaders in certain
fields of industry. Through trips to other
plant integral to the manufacture of their
products, as well as through work in their
engineering department, directed by squad
leaders. This plan tends to help both the
aspiring engineer and the company, since
each is able to look the other over rather
carefully before making final decisions.
When it comes to salaries, the small
company is forced to keep pace with the

concentrated in the field of education. To
begin with he was educated at a total
of six different universities receiving his
B.S. degree in education at Western Mich-
igan College of Education. He earned his
M.S. degree in 1948 and has taught since
1946.
For the past couple summers Bob has
been employed by the F. J. Littell Ma-
chinery Co. of Chicago where he under-
took to develop and execute a testing pro-
gram for engineers and draftsmen and a
summer training program for undergrad-
uate engineering students. He has called
upon his experiences and contacts in
these positions to prepare this article aim-
ed at destroying the common misconcep-
tions held by many students of engi-
neering.
salaries of large companies. However,
the potential of a young engineer is just
as great in a small company as it is in a
large one, because he has the opportunity
to grow with the concern. In fact, his re-
sponsibilities become greater in a shorter
time because he must grow before the
company can grow.
What Do You As a Young Engineer,
Do in the Field?
Actually, most engineers begin their
work in the drafting room, since their
first obligation is to learn the company's
system for listing, filing, and making
drawings. Here there seems to be a stigma
in men with engineering degrees that
drafting is below their professional dig-
nity. I speak from experience on this
matter, since each year I contact newly
graduated engineers on prospective em-
ployment, and at least ten to twenty do
not want jobs which involve drafting
work of any kind. This is always a real
setback for industry; one of the most im-
portant and useful tools of any engineer
for conveying his ideas to others for eval-
uation is his knowledge of, and his ability
to make, working drawings.
But today most universities and col-
leges are placing their greater emphasis
on pure research jobs for either inex-
perienced or experienced engineers. Those
particular jobs are generally for the top
notch student (usually with a Ph.D),
with a physics or chemistry background as
well as engineering training. Few men
realize that research jobs of the type most
engineers picture are far better prepared
for if the individual majors in physics or
chemistry rather than in engineering.
Industry today full realizes the de-
emphasis of drafting practices in the in-
stitutions of higher learning, but it not to-
tally in agreement, since such de-emphasis
is reflected in the work of the young
engineering graduate. In testing young
men in engineering schools for the F. J.
Littell Machine Company's summer train-
ing program I find that at least half of
the applicants are eliminated because of
their complete lack of ability in making
working drawings.
I believe that some plan must be de-
vised for the engineering student to ac-
quire a more comprehensive knowledge of
drafting, since it is one of the basic tools
of an engineer. Perhaps one year of high
school mechanical drawing should be add-
er to the entrance requirements of engi-
neering schools since the high school
courses generally deal with fundamental
concepts and techniques of drafting to a
greater extent than do most college
courses. Many engineers do board work
throughout their careers, particularly those
men interested in machine design and
product development. Here the nature
of their work is such that it requires keen
drafting ability.
Another phase of an engineer's work is
that of a designer, after some time has
been spent learning the system of the
company's standards. Although he has
had courses in stress analysis and strength
of materials, he will find designing is
more of an empirical than scientific na-
ture. // is a fact that much more design-
ing is accomplished through experience
than through analytical calculations. Most
designers go about their problems in this
way; "This bracket worked for a similar
job. Now I am doubling the material it
must handle, so this bracket should work
if I made it one fourth heavier, so I will
make it one half heavier just to be sure."
This kind of designing can only be ac-
complished through experience.
This leads me to the quality most com-
panies are looking for in an engineer.
This quality is creativity. This is a quality
good engineers must have, and it is the
quality many engineers do not have. Un-
fortunately the chances for success for
these men are very limited. Strange as
this may sound, most creative designs are
not complete new designs, but rather im-
provements on a component of an old
design which make the complete job more
useful and efficient. The creative design
on most products is usually not more than
ten to fifteen percent, with standard items
making up the rest of the unit. Generally,
if a complete new design is brought out,
it is usually the product on many engi-
neers' creative abilities, and not that of
just one man.
A great percentage of young engineers
say they want to be sales engineers. Now
just what they think of as a sales engi-
neer has eluded me for many years. Per-
haps there is a feeling that sales engineer-
ing is more dignified, and drawing will
not be required, or that salary rewards
will be greater. Most young engineers do
not seem to realize that to be good sales
engineers they must be completely
familiar with their product, its design,
capabilities, limitations, etc. Not only
that, but very often they are required to
do field maintenance of equipment, not
only on original installation, but on re-
placement parts as well.
Often sales engineers are asked to
recommend slight changes in original
equipment to accommodate a new product
after the machine has served its purpose
on the product for which it was originally
designed. In such cases sales engineers
must take specifications and problems,
and must work out some adaptation right
in the field. Most sales engineers are in-
structed to be honest about their knowl-

Perhaps the most significant trend in
engineering since World War II has
been the rapid development of computers.
In the past decade over one billion dollars
has been invested in the 3000 multi-pur-
pose machines now in use or construction.
And the results of this investment have
been phenomenal. Computers have mech-
anized science and industry, solving in a
few hours problems which would have
kept a roomfull of mathematicians busy
for two or three years.
Besides prodigious feats of calculation
and problem solving, computers have been
designed to perform other complicated
logical operations. For example, the
SAGE system, entrusted with the air de-
fense of the continental United States,
uses digital computers as its "command-
ing officers." Information on approach-
ing hostile aircraft is flashed from distant
radar stations to the computers which cal-
culate the most effective defensive moves.
And although it sounds almost like sci-
ence fiction, Business Week of April 7,
1956 states: "The computers will issue
orders to intercepting aircraft and guid-
ed missies over special radio links." Fur-
thermore, application of computers to
business and governmental operations has
produced astounding results. Administra-
tive automation is already a reality.
Computers in History
Despite their dramatic entrance into
military and commercial processes since
the war, computers have a long history.
Handed down from antiquity is the aba-
cus, a simple oriental device for doin£
arithmetic. Despite its simplicity, in th:
hands of a skilled operator it has out-
performed modern office machinery. Both

Realm of Science which by far

of the French mathematicians Pascal and
Leibnitz invented gadgets for doing arith-
metic. One such invention performed the
carrying of digits by the rotation of
meshed disks, a common principle in
modern office machinery. But the first real
computer was designed by Charles Bab-
bage, a professor at Cambridge. His de-
vice, called an Analytical Engine, was
financed by the British government. But
it was never completed since the technol-
ogy of the day was unable to produce
parts of the necessary tolerances. And
after many costly failures, Babbage died
in 1839- Weary of delay, the government
withdrew its support and the pioneering
project was terminated. In the same cen-
tury, Lord Kelvin suggested the basic
principles of a "differential analyzer" but
was also hampered by faulty technology.
Kelvin never began a computer but he
set down the basic ideas for one. How-
ever, his work was overlooked and most
of it was duplicated by others in the
twentieth century.
Dr. Vannevar Bush ushered in the era
of big computers in 1924 when he com-
pleted the "ballistic engine." His ballistic
engine, which solved only ballistic prob-
lems, was practically a prototype of the
"differential engine" which was built in
1930 at MIT under Dr. Bush. This ma-
chine solved differential equations by
mechanical methods. Though such results
lacked the generality of analytic methods
of solving differential equations, numeri-
cal solutions could be found for any spe-
cific data. During World War II other
mechanical computers were constructed,
notably a greatly improved computer
known as the MIT II which used elec-
tronic as well as mechanical methods to
solve problems. Now almost three thous-
and computers are in use and all of them
utilize electronics to some extent. Signifi-
cant modern computers are Bizmac, Uni-
vac, Ramac, and IBM's 650, 705 705,
and 709.
Types of Computers
Machines which perform mathematical
computations are of two basic types—
digital and analog. A digital computer
does its calculation using numbers and
formulas. It uses mechanical devices to
represent the individual digits. But on
the other hand, an analog computer
utilizes the inherent mathematics of some
mechanism that operates according to
mathematical laws. Hence analog com-
puters do not deal in numbers but in an-
alogous measurable quantities, the length
of a rod, the rotation of a potentiometer,
or the inherent mathematics of an elec-
tronic circuit. Furthermore, digital com-
puters are quite versatile while analog
computers are of necessity tailored for
one type of problem.
Digital Computer Operation
Some modern computers are a complex
maze of wires, tubes, black boxes, and
keyboards which entirely fill a large room.
But the components of the computer are
grouped in units which perform certain
simple functions. The most common units
are input, control, arithmetic, memory,
and output.
Input Devices
Input devices translate problems into
machine language. Most of them consist
of a keyboard that records information on
punched tape, punched cards, or magnetic
tape. Although punched cards have been
a mainstay of business for many years,
magnetic tape is superior in many respects.
One writer says that "magnetic tape is to
punched cards as microfilm is to books."
And high speed and compactness are

a new tape input available for computers
feeds tape into its machine at 80 feet per
second. Using magnetic tape the IBM
705 can receive 15,000 letters or num-
bers per second. Further, the compactness
of magnetic tape is made apparent by the
fact that only 2400 feet of reel of magnetic
tape holds as much information as 60,000
The program itself may be a plugboard
(in older computers), a stack of cards, a
paper tape, or a magnetic tape. Magnetic
tape is superior to the other methods for
control for the same reasons that it is su-
perior for input.
Since the programer is often a bottle-
neck to the high speed computers and be-
ing a human, makes errors, efforts are be-
punched cards. This one reel could store
all of the numbers in Manhattan's giant
telephone directory.
A new and interesting input device is
the flying spot scanner. This machine
eliminates the keyboard with its human
operator and can "read" numbers and
characters itself. By "examining" a small
area of printed material and breaking it
up into small dots of light and dark as a
television camera does, the scanner as-
sembles the pattern into pulses which it
compares with the common numerical and
alphabetical shapes stored in its electronic
memory.
Control Mechanisms
Automatic computers have many, some-
times thousands, of individual units which
must be organized before a problem can
be solved. Control mechanisms link the
separate parts, determining how a prob-
lem is to be done and what does it. To ac-
complish this linkage, extensive use is
made of the feedback principle. For ex-
ample, an answer from one section may
automatically be fed into a check mechan-
ism. But by far the most important ele-
ment of control is the program, a set of
instructions fed into the machine by its
operators. This sequence of instructions

a programer. Programs can be set up for
maximum speed or maximum reliability.
ing made to make the programing itself
automatic. Great progress toward a self-
programing computer has been made by
the Echert-Mauch Division of Remington
Rand, Inc. After a library of routines is
set up and compiling routines established,
the machine is able to select its own pro-
gram. It picks the right program cards
from its library and strings them together
to solve a given problem. For one prob-
lem, the machine took iy2 minutes to set
up the problem while a good human pro-
gramer required 16 hours. And the ma-
chine's program was correct; the human's
program had a few unavoidable errors.
Arithmetic Units
Computers greatly simplify their mathe-
matics by using binary notation or some
other special system rather than the deci-
mal system. The binary system is more
easily represented by the off-on nature of
the discrete state mechanisms which rep-
resent digits. It is based on powers of two
instead of powers of ten. For example, 35
in the decimal system is equal to
2s -|- 21 + 2°. Writing a 1 for each power
of two and a 0 down for each power that
is not used in the number, we have
100011. Translating 26.25 into binary no-
tation we write: 11010.01.
On some occasions, designers of com-
puters have found it convenient to employ
number .scales ,ather than the decimal and
binary. In some machines the binary nota-
tion is divided into triples and a scale
based on powers of eight is used. One
computer, the SEAC uses hexadecimal
notation. Besides the numericals 1-9, the
letters t for ten, e for eleven, d for dozen,
f for fourteen, and i for fifteen are used
for digits.
Binary notation is probably the most
common because of the comparative sim-
plicity in designing circuits for it. Below
are the complete multiplication and addi-
tion tables for binary digits.

Lower sum approximation with rectangles (place under left frame). Upper sum
approximation with rectangle (place under right frame). Digital integration. Ex-
tremely good approximations of areas under curves are obtained by taking an upper
and lower sum and taking finer increments until the two converge on the desired
accuracy.
The advantages of binary notation are
obvious—simplicity of representation and
ease of manipulation. But one disadvant-
age is that about three binary digits are
needed for each decimal digit. And a sec-
ond disadvantage is the unfamiliarity of
human operators with binary answers.
Some machines have elaborate translation
devices that change the binary to decimal,
some require well trained interpreters who
can figure out their answers rapidly, and
some have incorporated unusual number
scales to minimize these disadvantages.

Addition with differential gears.
Digital computers employ various
mathematical tricks to reduce problems to
the operation that they do extremely fast
—addition. One new computer reputedly
performs additions at the rate of 100,000
per second, while most computers add
15,000-40,000 numbers per second. So
when a problem of integration is encoun-
tered, the computer may simply approxi-
mate the answer to any desired accuracy,
by finding the area under the curve with
superhuman accuracy. This may be done

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


As the world's largest manufacturer of com-
Xx. munications equipment our continued
progress depends greatly on our engineers.
They have a key role in the production of some
50,000 types of apparatus and component parts
that Western Electric makes in a given year.
• To our engineers falls the monumental task
of developing manufacturing operations and of
planning the installation of telephone central
office equipment across the nation. They devise
the new machines, tools and methods needed
to do our job. They also shoulder the major
responsibilities in carrying out the defense con-
tracts the government has asked us to take over
— major projects like the Nike guided missile
system and SAGE, the continental defense
system.
• In the course of their technical work, engi-
neers participate in such broad managerial
functions as production, merchandising, instal-
lation, and many others. What's more, we have
a record of promotions from within. It's not
surprising, therefore, that fifty-five percent of
the college graduates in our upper levels of
management have engineering degrees.
• Naturally we do everything possible to en-
courage and speed the professional develop-
ment of our engineers. Just recently, for
example, we inaugurated a full-time off-the-job
Graduate Engineering Training Program at
special training centers, a program with few
parallels in American industry.
• The new engineer moves into the first phase
of this program, Introduction to Western Elec-
tric Engineering, four to six months after he
joins us and devotes nine weeks of study to
such technical subjects as communications sys-
tems, military electronic systems, product de-
sign principles. He takes part in the second
phase, General Development, after the first
year on the job. In this phase he devotes nine
weeks to courses in human relations, semantics,
engineering statistics, electronics, measure-
ments and instrumentation, systems circuit anal-
ysis. The third phase, Advanced Development
(4 weeks per year), is available to selected
engineers and is geared to the individual to
help develop his creative engineering abilities;
goes deeply into such subjects as magnetics,
computer applications, electronic switching,
radar fundamentals, feedback control systems
and technical paper writing.
• Besides this company-wide program, a
number of our divisions offer individual engi-
neering courses in their own specialties. We
also sponsor a Tuition Refund Plan for out-of-
hours study at nearby colleges. Open to all
employees, this plan helps our engineers study
for advanced degrees at Company expense.
• Truly there's an engineer's world here at
Western Electric .. . one in which engineers in
every field of specialization can expect to grow.

of the HeeUu Questionaire
The Readers Speak Up
Along with last May's issue a copy of
a questionnaire was received by
those individuals holding subscriptions.
The questionnaires were also placed at
various points in East and West Engineer-
ing Buildings to allow the readers with-
out subscriptions a chance to voice their
opinions.
The purpose of this questionnaire was
to provide the editors with more accurate
information about the prevailing likes and
dislikes of its readers relative to the
magazine as published. The areas of the
magazine covered by the questionnaire
were the articles, features, illustrations,
advertisements, special issues, and gen-
eral attractiveness.
It is often very easy to lose sight of the
best interests of the reader in turning out
a magazine month after month. Only by
conducting a survey of this nature can
the editors hope to remove some of the
dead areas of the magazine and to replace
them with something that would be more
appealing to the majority of our readers.
The following conclusions are drawn
from 87 questionnaires that were returned
complete.
Artices Found Satisfactory
About 75% of the responses found the
articles satisfactory, as opposed to being
too technical or not technical enough.
There were twice as many readers who
found the articles not technical enough
than too technical. However the articles in
the future generally will not be signifi-
cantly more technical than previously—to
abide by the 75% statistic.
Though two thirds of our readers usual-
ly find the length of the articles proper,
it is significant to note that the other
more often than not finds the articles
too long. This has encouraged us to pro-
vide in the future more articles of shorter
lengths to keep the total copy at least at
the previous level. The desirability of this
is substantiated by the response to the
next question on the number of articles.
More than half believed each issue of the
Technic contained too few articles. Very
few found too many articles.
The answers to the query about our
use of special issues was very reassuring.
About 80% of those that answered were
entirely satisfied. Some thought we'd been
using too many; few thought we didn't
use enough. Some worthwhile suggestions
for additional special issues were received.
We plan to devote three issues of this
'57-'58 volume to special topics. Novem-
ber will be a special issue on technical
writing.
As a result of the evaluation of the five
features that we employed last year, one is
being dropped completely, another is be-
ing revamped, and a new one is being
added. Those being retained are "Mc-
Higan," "So You Think It's New," and
"Technic Spotlights Progress." Surpris-
ingly enough there were a few comments
on eliminating any trace of off color
humor which might have been present in
last year's "McHigan." This year we have
a new censorship board who will try to
stop any leaks that might have existed. An
attempt will also be made to increase the
quantity of copy devoted to this feature
where possible.
Teasers Revamped
"Teasers" is being altered in order to
increase the number of readers to whom
it might appeal. In other words we're go-
ing to make the puzzles somewhat easier
and of a slightly different nature. There
will be more pure logic problems involv-
ing reasoning but no calculations. All
teasers requiring any brain-straining cal-
culations are being completely eliminated.
Picture puzzles incorporating such prob-
lems as "What happened to the Missing
square" or how can we join these dots
using only four lines" etc. will be a part
of the new "teasers." Not all "teasers"
will be problems; a little bit of "Believe
it or not" and some interesting paradoxi-
cal observations will be included. The
most welcome news to "Teasers" fans
will be the announcement that all answers
by HOWARD UROW, '58E
and solutions will appear in the same is-
sue as the problems. This is being adopted
in direct response to many requests that
were made in the questionnaires.
From time to time during the Interna-
tional Geophysical Year we will run a
special feature on recent developments
and activities of this broad program.
McHigan Most Popular
"McHigan" and "Spotlights Progress"
are the two most popular features as in-
dicated by the questionnaires. "Teasers"
and "So You Think It's New" are about
equal in popularity for runner-ups. The
exact ratings read "McHigan", "Spotlights
Progress", "So You Think It's New",
"Teasers", and "Photo Quiz" in that
order. The latter is being eliminated by
popular request.
It seems that our readers are enthu-
siastic about our use of illustrations and
color. The one criticism was that we em-
ployed too few. About 95% of those that
replied thought that the magazine was in-
deed attractive.
About three quarters of our readers
actually read the advertisements. Seventy
per cent of those that read them found
them interesting.
In summary it appears that looking at
the overall picture our readers are pleased
with our work. Many went out of their
way to commend the magazine in their
questionnaires. In the few areas that were
subject to the greatest criticism, such as
some of the features and the articles, defi-
nite action has already been taken by the
editors and further considerations are
under way. All of the practical individual
miscellaneous comments received on the
questionnaires are being presented to the
respective editors. The Technic wishes to
formally express its appreciation to all
those who were kind enough to supply
us with the information requested. We
welcome criticism aand should like to in-
vite any of the students or faculty who
might like to offer some, to visit our
offices or send us a letter.

With this, the Technic's seventy-sixth
year, a new feature turning back to
our early issues begins.
by JAMES STEVENS, '59E
Rummaging through the 1882 issue
of the Technic I uncovered a section
in a paper by James Sanderson, C.E.'78,
that I though might be of interest to
those who have taken C M 1 or who have
ever run a test on a tensile specimen. Mr.
Sanderson describes a rupture test for a
specimen.
"There was but one bar, instead of
two, and this was clamped at one end and
free at the other. To the free end was
clamped the measuring apparatus, consist-
ing, essentially, of a small steel roller,
bearing a long, light radial arm of steel.
The roller which rested on the top edge
of the test-piece, was roughened, so as to
roll upon it without slipping, and as it
revolved, the end of the steel arm moved
around a brass arc, upon which were
marked, in greatly exaggerated scale, the
distances passed over by the periphery
of the roller. . . .
"I am aware that Rankine objects to
this method of measuring the proof
strength as unscientific; but it gives re-
sults which are satisfactory for practical
purposes, and for shop work, where dis-
patch is needed, rather than scientific
nicety. . . ."
To illustrate how long ago this test
was originated I took this cut from a 50
year old issue:
"Telephone service on campus is now
a reality. Some sixty-plus pairs of tele-
phone bells jingle in the office of our
different professors and officials, and the
business of the University has received an
acceleration which is, after all, only a part
of its natural growth. These are days of
higher pressures: higher steam pressures,
higher feed wire pressures, higher busi-
ness pressures; and it is only natural that
the University partake of this advance."
Just twenty-five years ago this picture
of the new Federal Building in Detroit
was run as a cover. The magazine itself
had advanced and had a joke page called
Transit Slants from which I stole this.

TO
NOURISH
AN IDEA
Dr. Peter J. W. Debye, professor emeritus of chemistry at Cornell
University, and Dr. Lloyd P. Smith, President, Avco Research
and Advanced Development Division, discuss the Avco research
program prior to Dr. Debye's recent colloquium at the Division's
Lawrence, Massachusetts, headquarters.
Pictured above is our new Research Center now under construc-
tion in Wilmington, Massachusetts. Scheduled for completion in
early 1958, this ultramodern laboratory will house the scientific
and technical staff of the Avco Research and Advanced Develop-
ment Division.
Avco's new research division now offers unusual and ex-
citing career opportunities for exceptionally qualified and
forward-looking scientists and engineers in such fields as:
Science:
Aerodynamics • Electronic* • Mathematics • Metallurgy
Physical Chemistry • Physics • Thermodynamics
Engineering:
Aeronautical • Applied Mechanics • Chemical • Electrical
Heat Transfer • Mechanical • Reliability • Flight Test
Write to Dr. R. W. Johnston, Scientific and Technical Relations,
Avco Research and Advanced Development Division,
20 South Union Street, Lawrence, Massachusetts.
The full impact of science on man and his economy is just
beginning to be realized. Past achievements, translated into
today's technology, are transforming the world.
In the dynamic environment man has created, his civilization
cannot stand still. He is committed to move forward to new
scientific breakthroughs that lay the foundation for a strong
economy based on advanced technical achievement.
Creative scientists and engineers, working together in an intel-
lectual environment where ideas can be freely expressed and
freely explored, will shape this new economy. Avco is creating
the environment in which uninhibited thinking men can search
out new problems and work toward their solution. A new research
center will provide a physical environment, facilities and contact
with stimulating minds to nourish the best ideas that each man
contributes.
Some of America's foremost scientists and engineers are at work
here. Consultants, like Dr. Peter J. W. Debye, contribute through
colloquia and the stimulation of the inter-disciplinary currents
imperative to high-level scientific performance.
Avco's scientific approach to urgent national defense problems
has already brought advances in high-altitude, high-speed flight,
missile re-entry, aerodynamics, heat transfer, materials and other
areas. Practical problems have been solved; scientific horizons
have been widened. But the greatest challenge at Avco lies with
work yet to be done.

SPOTLIGHTS
PROGRESS
Compiled by BOB RUSNAK
This summer has not passed without
progress in a variety of fields. This
month aeronautics, electricity, and the
Navy have examples to offer on this and
following pages.
Engine Flameout Eliminated
Engine flameout—one of the few re-
maining hazards to jet flight—may be
eliminated by a simple automatic re-
igniter unveiled here today by Charles
Engelhard, Inc., of the Engelhard In-
dustries.
Intake of small amounts of water or
ice, or even violent air turbulence, can
cause a jet engine to lose flame. At pres-
ent, the pilot must try to restart the
engine manually. This can be difficult
at high altitudes. If reignition is delayed
too long, it may cause a damaging ex-
plosion in the engine when it does
occur.
Engelhard's reigniter, called "Insta-
lite," is little more than a platinum-alloy
rod or tube smaller than a cigarette. It
has no electrical connections or moving
parts, and requires no maintenance.
Yet, in extensive tests in the Britan-
nia 102, a device of this type "invari-
ably" restarted the engine so fast that
the pilot was scarcely aware flameout
had occurred, according to a report in
"Flight," official organ of Britain's
Royal Aero Club.
According to "Flight," the "glow
plugs" were installed in the Britannia's
Proteus 705 engines after it was dis-
covered that under certain atmospheric
conditions a special type of ice crystal
was causing repeated, although relative-
ly unhazardous, flameouts.
"During the extensive proving of the
modified engines" in flights deliberately
arranged to encounter these special ice
concentrations, it was found that "in-
variably the glow plug would relight the
fuel immediately, and the loss of full
power was never greater than a second.
The relight was barely detectable except
by noting a transient drop in r.p.m. of
from 60 to 300 in about 11,000 r.p.m.,"
the British magazine reported.
The reigniters must be placed where
they will be treated by the engine's reg-
ular operation. Sometimes they can be
put into holes provided in the combus-
tion-chamber wall for the regular elec-
trical igniters used to start the engine
manually—usually only four of the
eight holes provided are actually taken
taken up by regular igniters.
"Instalite" requires no maintenance be-
cause the platinum alloy is engineered to
be impervious to "grain growth" despite
the intense heat encountered in jet
engines, according to Engelhard. The
alloy is not poisoned by tetraethyl lead
or other jet-fuel components. It can ig-
nite heavy and light hydrocarbons with
equal facility, the company said.
The New Jersey precision-products
manufacturer explained that the plat-
inum alloy is a catalyst for jet-fuel com-
bustion—that is, its very presence pro-
motes the burning. The rod also has
high heat retentivity. Thus, kept at com-
bustion temperature by the engine's reg-
ular operation, it acts as an automatic
"pilot light" or "glow plug" when
flameout occurs.
A jet engine operates much like a
plumber's blowtorch. A steady stream of
air is taken in the plane's nose and
mixed with fuel. The flowing mixture
burns continuously at a certain point in
the engine corresponding to the blow-
torch's mouth.
As with a blowtorch, the flame may
go out and stay out if it is interrupted
even briefly. Water inhaled from pud-
dles on the runway during takeoff may
quench it. Ice may form on the air in-
takes at high altitudes, break off, and be
sucked into the engine, where it mo-
mentarily blocks the air flow.
A tight maneuver or concussion from
an explosion also can cut off the air
supply for an instant, causing flameout.
Some jets can suffer compressor stalls
and consequent loss of flame when their
guns are fired.
The little platinum-alloy rod prevents
all this by relighting the fuel flow auto-
matically and instantaneously while con-
ditions still are favorable. "It is charac-
teristic of flameouts that the airflow is
chopped for only a fraction of a second.
It returns while the hot rod is still in-
candescent, and the mixture is immedi-
ately relit," exlains Capt. Houston of
BOAC.

by dividing the area into thousands of
rectangles, trapezoids, or even parabola
bounded segments, taking an upper and
lower sum of their values and grinding
out approximations of the area until the
two converge with the desired accuracy.
Multiplication is another operation
that is done with high speed addition.
For example, multiplication of 325364
by 945 can be done by adding 325364 to
itself 944 times. Various other strategies
are used to avoid, whenever possible,
messy operations like division and dif-
ferentiation, often utilizing approxima-
tions.
Another function usually grouped with
the arithmetic circuits is the logic unit. It
can usually perform logical transpositions
and substitutions and sometimes prove
validity of an argument by the method of
complete substitution or truth tables. An
argument is invalid if its premises are
true and its conclusion false. Following
are a valid and an invalid argument.
Valid Invalid (Fallacy of af-
(modus ponus) firming the consequent)
1. If P then Q 1. If P then Q
2. P 2. Q
.:3. Q . :3. P
This is how the validity of their struc-
ture could be checked by machine using
all possible combinations.

Valid. Invalid. The argu-
ment is invalid since
line 1 has all true
reasons but still
reaches a false con-
clusion.
The simple logical examples cited show
how machines can determine the validity
of the structure of an argument without
regard to the content (substitution in-
stances) of the argument. Humans can
easily determine the validity of arguments
such as these which have only two or
three premises (reasons). But the law
which applies to the possible combinations
of truth and falsity makes arguments of
great complexity (many reasons) difficult
for humans to evaluate. For the number
of possible combinations of true and
false arguments is equal to 2", where n is
the number of reasons. So with only 10
reasons or alternatives to consider there
are 1024 possible combinations of T's and
F's to consider. But a machine can do log-
ical combinations of hundreds of alterna-
tives due to its great speed in considering
the many combinations. This great logical
ability is valuable in science and compli-
cated economic problems.
Memory Devices
Certain information must be retained in
a computer during the solution of a prob-
lem and certain constants must be known.
Information like this is called "memory."

information are called "writing", "read-

ing", and "erasing" respectively. Three
common methods of storing information
are used by digital computers—magnetic,
electrostatic, and delay.
The first method, magnetic memory,
may use magnetic tape, drums, or wire.
In all magnetic storage schemes, a pattern
of polarized spots on a surface is used
to represent information. These magnetic
devices combine permanence with ease of
change. In the future, magnetic tape will
probably be used instead of the other two
because of its previously stated advant-
ages.
The next method, electrostatic, stores
information as charged, lighted, spots
on a cathode-ray tube screen. These spots
fade in about five minutes on the best
screen yet developed, but in a machine
where operations are measured in mil-
lionths of a second, five minutes is a long
time. And some tubes have been develop-
ed which have a holding beam that
periodically renews the charges on the
screen, thus giving permanence. This elec-
trostatic memory has the advantage of ex-
tremely rapid availability.
The third and last method of memorv
is delay-line storage. It changes the elec-
trical pulses which represent numbers into

wave. After a delay, the sound wave is
changed back into electrical pulses. Con-
sider a specific machine, the BENAC. In
it a 18 inch tube of mercury with quartz
crystals at each end stores the sound
waves. A sound ripple is put into the mer-
cury when the crystal expands against the
end of the tube by the piezoelectric effect.
Since sound waves travel through mercury
in about one mile per second at 65', they
take 336 microseconds to travel from crys-
tal to crystal. Each pulse of the machine
requires only y4 microsecond. Conse-
quently 1,344 pulses, each of which
stands for a binary digit, can be stored in
one delay-line column at one time. And
the pulses can be stored indefinitely by
amplifying the pulses which emerge from
the output crystal and feeding them back
to the input crystal.
Output Devices
After the computer has solved the prob-
lem, it communicates the solution to its
operators via the output. In early ma-
chines, the output was just a row of lights
which gave the answer in binary digits.
Now, some machines have converters
which change the binary answer into the
decimal system. Others, like Univac use
high speed printers which can print up
to 900 lines per minute. And digital com-
puters that are tailored for some special
purpose sometimes have unusual output
devices. For example, the automatic ac-
counting computer of the Bank of
America flashes a special warning light
when an account is about to be overdrawn.
Analog Computers
Analog computers are much more com-
mon than digital computers. They are
usually tailored for one specific type of
problem such as finding the square root of
a product of two numbers or piloting a
guided missile. Analog computers are use-
ful where there is one variable, where
physical quantities are involved, where
great precision is not necessary, and where
practicality is desired.
Input
Almost any automatic machine which
operates according to some variable might
be called an analog computer. Input de-
vices are therefore almost as varied as the
types of computers. In many computers of
this type the input is electronic, but it
may be simply the movement of a geared
wheel. Since all analog computers deal
in continuous quantities and not discrete
numbers the input is often called "quan-
tity representation." And since analog
computers are limited to one function or
set of functions there is not an elaborate
control unit.
Analog Arithmetic
An analog machine can never give the
exact product of two numbers but it does
give a measurable quantity which is an-
alogous to the product of the two num-
bers. Hence analog computers are limited
in their accuracy by our ability to measure.
Another factor is the limit of accuracy in
machining parts for such computers. Con-
sequently, no analog computers are more
Applications of Computers
Computers have enormous powers of
calculation and attention to detail which
make them extremely useful to govern-
ment and industry. A digital computer
could conceivably be the "brains" for an
automatic factory, doing accounting, con-
trolling industrial processes, engineering
calculations, program procedures, and
print payrolls.
Accounting Ability
Digital computers can make routine
substitutions using huge numbers and
many formulas, an ability applicable to
accounting. For example, Monsanto
Quantity Representation—curve follower feeds input into an analog machine. A
sheet metal or plastic replica can be made of an emperical curve and it can be
traced out by the curve follower.
accurate than one part in 10' and some
only as accurate as one part in 10.
Addition on analog computers is often
done with differential gears. (See dia-
gram.) And subtraction is simply addition
in reverse or an opposite rotation of one
of the input shafts. Multiplication can be
done electronically or by the ratio of
gear sizes. And division is simply the
reciprocal of multiplication. Often a po-
tentiometer is used to convert mechanical
rotation to an electrical signal to be used
in more elaborate operations.
Analog integration can be done by
either electronic or mechanical means. The
mechanical method of wheel and disc (see
diagram) was used with success in Bush's
Ballistic Analyzer and Differential Ana-
lyzer, but electronic methods are much
faster. In recent years analog computers
have been used to solve many types of ap-
plied integration problems aand differen-
tial equations.
Chemical Corp., uses a computer to pre-
pare statement of sales, gross profit by
products, cost of goods, and overall sales
distribution. The company's computer
also processes property accounting rec-
ords, calculates dividends, employee
bonuses, and pension reserves. In the near
future it will be turning out raw material
and finished goods records, investment
return by product group, and payrolls. In
these problems the digital computer's
rapid accuracy and high-speed printers are
used to the fullest. And just six hours of
payroll calculation per day by a Univac
will have the company $500,000 per year.

Dr. Karl Kordesch is seen holding one of the specially-treated electrodes,
and examining a fuel cell unit.
Electricity from Gases Now
Practical
The direct conversion of the chemical
energy of gases into electricity—long a
dream of scientists and for years a lab-
oratory curiosity—has been accomplished
here with the development of the first
fuel cell capable of economically pro-
ducing thousands of watts of power.
Using hydrogen and oxygen as fuel, the
new silent source of power has been
developed by scientists at the Research
Laboratories of National Carbon Com-
pany, Division of Union Carbide Cor-
poration.
Hollow Carbon Electrodes the Key
"Secret of the new fuel's success," Dr.
C. E. Larson, National Carbon's research
vice-president, said, "is the chemically
treated, hollow, porous carbon electrodes
through which the gases enter the cell,
and which also conduct the electricity
produced by the electrochemical reac-
tion."
Designed to work at ambient tempera-
tures, and at approximately atmospheric
pressure, the new fuel cell is the first
that does not depend on high tempera-
tures or pressures for efficient operation,
Dr. Larson explained.
The production of electricity directly
from hydrogen and oxygen in a fuel
cell is inherently more efficient than its
production in a conventional steam sys-
tem in which the heat is supplied by
burning these same gases. Practical lim-
itations in utilizing all of the heat pro-
duced reduce the overall efficiency of a
steam system to approximately 30 or 35
percent, while a fuel cell, which elim-
inates the intermediate heat step and
converts directly from chemical to elec-
trical energy, has a top efficiency of about
twice that figure.
Fuel Cell vs. Conventional Batteries
"Unlike conventional batteries, fuel
cells remain essentially unchanged during
their operating life, and produce electri-
cal energy from chemical fuels supplied
as needed," said Dr. Karl Kordesch,
who has been responsible for the re-
search work. "A primary battery, such as
used in a flashlight, produces electrical
energy by the consumption of its chem-
ical elements. When the chemicals are
used up, the battery is dead.' A secon-
dary battery, such as used in an auto-
mobile, can be recharged during its life
by passing electricity back into it, where
it is stored for future use.
"This new fuel cell," Dr. Kordesch
explained, "is merely a sealed jar into
which are fed hydrogen and oxygen
through the special hollow electrodes.
The electrochemical reaction of the gases
at these electrodes produces an electric
current, with only water as a by-product.
With the water disposed of by evapora-
tion, the life of the fuel cell is theoret-
ically unlimited. Cells have been oper-

in the field of Combustion
Historically, the process of combus-
tion has excited man's insatiable
hunger for knowledge. Since his
most primitive attempts to make
use of this phenomenon, he has
found tremendous fascination in its
potentials.
Ferhaps at no time in history has
that fascination been greater than
it is today with respect to the use
of combustion principles in the
modern aircraft engine.
At Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft,
theorems of many sciences are being
applied to the design and develop-
ment of high heat release rate de-
vices. In spite of the apparent sim-
plicity of a combustion system, the
bringing together of fuel and air in
proper proportions, the ignition of
the mixture, and the rapid mixing
of burned and unburned gases in-
volves a most complex series of
interrelated events — events ocur-
ring simultaneously in time and
space.
Although the combustion engi-
neer draws on many fields of science
(including thermodynamics, aero-
dynamics, fluid mechanics, heat
transfer, applied mechanics, metal-
lurgy and chemistry), the design of
combustion systems has not yet
been reduced to really scientific
principles. Therefore, the highly
successful performance of engines
like the J-57, J-75 and others stands
as a tribute to the vision, imagina-
tion and pioneering efforts of those
at Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft en-
gaged in combustion work.
While combustion assignments,
themselves, involve a diversity of
engineering talent, the field is only
one of a broadly diversified engi-
neering program at Pratt &amp; Whitney
Aircraft. That program—with other
far-reaching activities in the fields
of instrumentation, materials prob-
lems, mechanical design and aero-
dynamics — spells out a gratifying
future for many of today's engi-
neering students.
Mounting an afterburner in a special high-altitude test
chamber in P&amp;WA's Willgoos Turbine Laboratory permits
study of a variety of combustion problems which
may be encountered during later development stages.
Microflash photo illustrates one continuing
problem: design and development of fuel
injection systems which properly atomize
and distribute under all flight conditions.

signs of deterioration. This type of oper-
ation was purposely chosen for testing
because the repeated starts and stops
are much harder on the cell than would
be continuous, around-the-clock oper-
ation.
One Kilowatt Per Cubic Foot
"The efficiency of operation of the
new fuel cell depends on how it is used,
but the general efficiency range is from
65 to 80 percent when operated at norm-
al temperatures and pressures," Dr. Kor-
desch said. "Just as an automobile gives
better mileage at moderate speeds than
when it is 'gunned,' so does a fuel cell
operate most efficiently when no attempt
is made to draw the maximum power
from a minimum volume. Efficiency is
affected by power density—that is, at
lower currents, a greater percentage of
the chemical energy is converted to elec-
trical energy. Research and development
to date indicate that the optimum fuel
cell design will be one which will pro-
duce approximately one kilowatt of
power from a packaged unit one cubic
foot in volume."
The voltage across the electrodes of
the new fuel cell is approximately one volt,
and it is simply a matter of connecting
a number of cells in a circuit to get any
voltage desired. The amount of electrical
current produced by the cell depends on
its physical size, so by varying the num-
ber and size of cells, many combinations
of voltages and currents can be obtained.
Basically, the fuel cell is most desirable
for high current, low voltage use.
Fuel Cell's Future
The inherent advantages of the fuel
cell make it an ideal source of silent
electrical power in remote locations
where conventional fuels and water
power are not available.
Another possible future use of the fuel
cell is in connection with the utilization
of both solar and nuclear energy. One of
the problems in harnessing the energy
of the sun is the storage of power. Dur-
ing sunny periods, the energy of the sun
could be used to decompose water into
hydrogen and oxygen, for later use in
fuel cells. Nuclear energy is known to
decompose water, and in present nuclear
plants in which the reactor serves only
as a source of heat in the conventional
steam cycle, efforts have to be made to
prevent this decomposition. Perhaps it
will work the other way, with nuclear
energy directly producing hydrogen and
oxygen for fuel cell operation.
"The demand for portable and remote
silent sources of power has increased
rapidly in the last few years," Dr. Larson
concluded, "and countless uses await a
practical solution to the problem. The
fuel cell holds great promise for the
future, and the day may come when such
common devices as lawnmowers, out-
board motors, and even small cars will
silently be propelled by the power out-
put of fuel cells. Gone will be the noisy
put-put of the combustion engine, for
fue cells will be using the same fuel to
convert directly to electrical energy for
powering quiet motors."
Oxygen Supply System
Liquid oxygen, once a laboratory curi-
osity, is now a weight-saving innovation
in personal oxygen systems for crews of
high-altitude carrier-based aircraft built
by Douglas Aircraft company for the
Navy.
Requiring less than half the space of
conventional high pressure bottles made
of heavy steel, the new system operates
at very low pressures and is but a frac-
tion of the weight.
Liquid oxygen represents the most
compact method of storing and carrying
oxygen, and results in a weight saving
of approximately 75 percent over sys-
tems using natural oxygen.
The system consists of an insulated
spherical tank for the liquid oxygen sur-
rounded by a coil of uninsulated tubing
which transforms the liquid oxygen into
the useable gaseous state. It is then drawn
by the pilot's respiratory action through
a conventional demand system.
The system is so compact that a single
low pressure unit, weighing only 55
pound when filled, replaces eight high
pressure oxygen cylinders weighing a
total of 176 pounds.
New Propulsion System for
Landing Craft
A right angle drive propulsion system
for landing craft, combining the ad-
vantages of an inboard engine with those
of a fully steerable outboard propeller,
has been developed by Waste King Cor-
poration.
Boyd C. Marshall, manager of the
Los Angeles firm's Engineering and De-
velopment Division, said the new system
has satisfactorily completed Navy ac-
ceptance trials and will now undergo
further testing by the Bureau of Ships.
It replaces the conventional rudder
system in current model landing craft
with an inboard engine driving an out-
board propeller capable of rotating 360°
or more without stops.
Marshall said this increases a cox-
swain's ability to maneuver in close quar-
ters by providing complete craft control
in all directions under the most adverse
conditions.
"The system," he said, "also incorp-
orates a new design principle which per-
mits direct mechanical steering by elim-
inating the torque reaction of the pro-
peller. This enables the craft to make
maximum use of available engine power
while traveling in any direction."
Correct blade rotation in any direction,
and under full throttle, assures effective
backing and side thrust.
Landing craft using the new system
generally are maneuverable enough to
avoid broaching on the beach, Marshall
reported. If they do broach in heavy seas,
however, the propeller may be swivelled
instantly to the most desirable position.
Sufficient side or reverse thrust is then
available to pull the craft free.
"This is particularly important," Mar-
shall said, "because previously as many
as half of the landing craft in a single
action broached and were damaged when
the surf was high."

... we don't want just any engineer. We want engineers with ideas, engineers
with drive, engineers who can stick with a job and work with other people to
get it done. Scientists, business and liberal arts graduates, too.
Union Carbide has a marvelous potential. It's a top producer of many
things, from petrochemicals to titanium, from molecular sieves to flashlight
batteries. Its sales have soared from a half a billion in '47 to one and a third
billion in '56.
And we plan to keep on growing. That's where you come in.
We need creative people. We spend a good portion of sales profit on research,
but it takes creative people to make research effective.
We need people with initiative. They are the key to opening up new markets
and to get production rolling. We introduce new products at the rate of two a
month, and the rate is accelerating.

culation which in turn assisted the Treas-
urer by permitting higher advertising
rates.
Quoting Steinar Vaksdal, '34 and '35,
"1933 and 1934 was to us, as to every-
one else, a period of financial worry, all
cuts for the magazine were borrowed.
Subscriptions were low. Our problem was,
how many and to whom free copies

of it to the old printing debt."
So it was the Slide Rule Ball revived
by Ben C. Lansdale, business manager
'31, that materially assisted the Technic
to "burn the mortgage." "Progress was
made on reduction of the debt during
1941," said C. R. Tieman. We held the

should be sent (to maintain circulation).
We used the Michigan Engineer's Song
Book (published by 1929 staff) in our
promotional work."
L. Verne Ausel, '31, mentions "draw-
ing instruments and slide rules which
were imported from Germany" and sold
by Technic staff.
The staff "bled" cuts, borrowed en-
gravings, economized in every possible
way and used the profit from the Slide
Rule Ball to pay off the debt to the
printers.
The debt was being reduced but some
of it was still in existence in 1937. Rob-
ert H. Baldwin says "we also took a good
crack at reducing that debt to the printer.
Unless my memory fails me, we struck it
rich (with Slide Rule Ball)—had Red
Norvo and Mildred Bailey right out of
to pay off the debt. Sometime between
1941 and 1951, the debt was liquidated
for Thomas G. Bassett reports that "at the
time I left in June 1951 there was no
debt of any kind."
George Weesner reports that he has
vivid impressions of deadlines—"when
he and 'Fuzz' Fusbush were publications
managers under Andy Ashburn. We help-
ed to pay off a few pennies of the debt."
Goff Smith '38 says in his reply, "man-
aging the Technic in my day was a shoe-
string operation carried on largely by the
enthusiasm of Bob Baldwin, '37, Sid
Steinboon, '38, and Dave Lansdale, '38."
Engineering Colleges Magazine
Association
Membership in the E.C.M.A. was ex-
tremely helpful to the Technic during the
depression years. Undoubtedly it was to
other schools as well. It was sponsored
by Littel-Murray-Barnhill, advertising
specialists of New York. They were able
to contact headquarters for all large in-
dustries and procure advertising for the
engineering college magazines that stu-
dent advertising managers scattered
throughout the country could not be sure
of, and with local advertising so drasti-
cally curtailed in 1930 it is almost certain
that but for them some magazines would
have had to suspend publication.
The second conference of the E.C.M.A.
was held in February, 1921. At the time
Michigan and about ten other colleges
were represented, a constitution and cer-
tain standards were adopted. At the pres-
ent (1957) there are 43 members.
The U. S. corporation tax scheme
whereby money spent for advertising was
declared a business operating expense
created a favorable attitude toward adver-
tising. Any hundred thousand dollars of
profit was taxable to the extent of 42 per
cent or more. The company got less than
1/2 of it. The government got the rest. By
spending the hundred thousand for ads,
the company got one hundred thousand
dollars worth of selling service at less
than 1/2 price. The money was put
into circulation providing jobs, and stim-
ulating business. Possibly some economist
has figured out that out of it all the
government got its lost tax back after all.
At any rate the scheme proved a boom
to the Technic, for with a given circula-
tion they could charge an agreed upon
rate-per-page and were able to tell in
advance very closely what their advertis-
ing income would be.
The E.C.M.A. held an annual meeting
at which prizes were awarded to the mem-
ber colleges for superior accomplishment
in the different phases of magazine pub-
lishing. The Technic staffs have, we are
sure, captured their share of these awards.
They provide an excellent method where-
by relative merit is measured.
Of course staff members all wanted
to attend the annual meeting at which the
awards were made. Some money was

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


to assist in defraying expenses of the
top 2 or 3 staff members, but during de-
pression years the advisory board was
pretty sure that each individual had to
at least finance partially his trip.
Various ingenious methods were de-
vised by staff members, to get transporta-
tion to the spring E.C.M.A. meetings.
Quoting Keith Smith, "Perhaps the most
spectacular inovation (for which I recall
Bill Hutchinson was responsible) was the
use of Professor Brackett's venerable but
commodious limousine dubbed the "Tech-
nic Taxi" to provide transportation to the
meeting of the E.C.M.A. at Purdue in
1943." C. R. Tieman remembers best a
blind date at E.C.M.A. meeting in Fay-
etteville, Arkansas. Steinar Vaksdal says,
"I used an advertising due bill from
American Air Lines to secure transporta-
tion to Chicago and on to Milwaukee for
the E.C.M.A. convention."
George Weesner, '4lE, related that
"with three other seniors on the staff I
attended the E.C.M.A. convention at the
University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. I
was accustomed to it and relatively im-
pervious, but when the southern girls
rolled their eyes at my Yankee com-
panions, I almost had to go back to Ann
Arbor alone."

The Slide Rule Ball
The Slide Rule Ball was revived in
1931; quoting David B. Lansdale, "my
brother Ben C. Lansdale, revived the
Slide Rule Ball—gave it publicity by turn-
ing up the old old slide rule once stolen
by the lawyers. Actualy the Technic staff
men made the rule—got it dirty—then
gave it publicity for the dance."* L.
Verne Ausel '31 was general chairman.
Previously or before temporary suspension
of the Ball, the large slide rule, an im-
portant decorative feature had been stolen.
It was reported that law students were
responsible and Ausel says "a large rep-
lica of the Slide Rule that had been stolen
. . . was made up for this dance, and was
publicized as the recovered original." D.

was given the story that the large Slide
Rule had been 'found,' I was never quite
certain that it was not a newly made im-
poster rather than the original." Robert L.
Taylor '36 thinks the "Lawyers must have
been underfed in the early thirties." No
trouble with them broke out in 1936, but
the battle over the slide rule at the ball
was reived and looked upon as an
annual certainty until a few days ago.
Keith L. Smith '43 says "The lawyers
as usual made off with the big slide rule."
The words of their spokesman, when they
returned it at the height of festivities
rings in my ears yet.—"Next year there
wil probably be twice as many engineers
in the Engineering College as now. The
draft will have reduced the Law School to
six 4-F's and a midget, but I'll bet my
first month's pay as an army private that
the lawyers will make off with the slide
rule next year too!" P.S. Did they?
Girls Added to the Staff
By 1943 the financial situation was
brighter, but the personnel problem was
acute. There were plenty of men in the
Engineering College, but many were spe-
cial military course students and the re-
mainder were anxious to get their degrees
and become eligible for commissions or
to take special military courses preparing
them for special technical assignments
in the military.
Girls and women were working in de-
fense manufacturing plants; why couldn't
they serve on the Technic? They could
and did and proved so competent that
they are still on it. In 1943 we find these
names on the mast-head, Joyce Shapero,
Marjorie Baker and Audrey Geschelin
who in the summer of 1944 is listed as
Asistant Editor. In May 1944 Marie
Glucksman's name appears; by December
1944 Marjorie Baker was Assistant Editor
and Karen Nelson was a feature writer.
Then Joyce Shapero (1946E) became
Business Manager and Bettie Housen
('45E) office manager. In 1945 Lucile
Kennedy was on the staff along with
Marilyn Moash, Mary Pat King and
Marion Heilman.
In November 1946 Edith Olson's name
appears and by February 1947 Florence
Tsilkoff ('48E) was illustrations editor.
Florence is now Mrs. R. V. Baum of
Phoenix, Orizonia. In rely to our request
for "your most vivid impressions of Tech-
nic operations or management," she said
"I was madly in love with a reporter."*
Outside of that I also remember the
Magazine was run on a dictatorship basis.
The Editor-in-Chief, Managing Editor
and Business Manager were the only ones
who knew what was going on. The rest
of us were assigned jobs and were ex-
pected to do them and ask no questions.
Mrs. Baum also said, "working on the
Tecbnic was one of the brightest spots*
in my college career. I also found that
interviewers (when jobs were a little
harder to get) were impressed with such
college activities.** One interviewer went
around asking all of his Michigan grads
what kind of a magazine the Technic was,
and got reports from "good technical in-
formation" to "a farce." Whatever the
results, I know we all did our best to
make it worthy of the Michigan Engi-
neering College and I'm sure today's staff
is just as conscientious."
Next we find on the 1947 staff, Mari-
lyn Marsh (again). Eve Gault, Nancy
Philips, Jo Lince, and Ann Lawrence.
And in 1948 there are Frances Doty,
Harriet Ewing, Martha Wise, Linda
Menke, Elen Mulrehill and Janet Taylor.
Finally in 1957 a female reached the
top. Working up through the ranks of
Advertising Manager and Business Man-
ager, Jean Boch became Editor-in-Chief
in February and wil remain in that posi-
tion throughout this current semester.
On The Value of Technic Work
"One of the most valuable things that
I learned was that to show a profit in
business, income must exceed outgo. This
I learned by doing' on the Technic."—
R. L. Taylor '36.
"I'd just like to mention that my ex-
perience on the Technic was one of the
most valuable and enjoyable I've ever
had—the things I learned about express-
ing and illustrating ideas, selling, man-
aging, planning have been among the most
useful things I've ever learned. It was
Profesor A. D. Moore who inspired me
to try out for the Technic. I'm grateful to
him for the nudge. It was Profesor Brack -
ett who showed me the value of properly
expressing myself. Some of my finest im-
pression of college days go back to the
meetings we of the Technic staff had with
you men on the Faculty Advisory Board.
Your understanding, sympathy and en-
thusiasm had much to do with any

er about the reporter.
achievement we may have made." These
feelings were expressed by Robt. H.
Baldwin '37.
Sidney Steinboon, '38, noted: "I recall
that our relations (with the Faculty Ad-
visory Board) were always very cordial
and that you afforded us every opportun-
ity to exercise independence of thought
and action. We were aware that you were
looking over our shoulder, but you gave
us a long leash. This certainly had a very
maturing effect on all of us. If we did
not appreciate it then, I certainly do now."
"The fact that I was business manager
for the Technic helped me get my job
with the Scott Paper Co., when jobs
weren't too plentiful. The recruitor want-
ed an engineer with business interests and
my Technic experience spoke for itself.
Best regards to both of you men; you had
a stronger influence than you may have
realized on my education," commented
David B. Lausdale '38E.
George Weesner, '4lE, continues: "We
got a good publicity story (once) in the
Daily. I went to the Publications Bldg
about 11:00 p.m. to try to get in a line
or two, and was invited to write my own
story. Not a word was changed.
A year later, I was introduced to the
girl who was night editor on that night.
After I had married her, she explained
how the rest of the staff had deserted that
night; she was just putting the paper to
bed alone and hadn't time to re-write it."
This explains why Mr. Weesner was
impervious to the charms of the Arkansas
girls when he was attending the E.C.M.A.
convention, mentioned earlier.
Henry L. Kaminsky '47 advises us that
his "entire asociation with the Technic
was pleasant and educational, sort of a
"junior achievement" on the college level.
McHIGAN
McHigan shows up for the first time
in Dec. 1943. We aren't sure who wis
responsible for the unique alteration of
Michigan, but we suspect that during his
time Robt. H. Overcashier '44E supplied
some of the jokes(?); at least when
criticisms came in from high school prin-
cipals to the President of the University
and the Dean of Engineering, Mr. Over-
cashier acted in defense counsel for
McHigan. We hope McHigan prospers
and has a better understanding of basic
principles of public relations than at the
time in question.

FOR
ENGINEERS
Engineering Honor Council
The Engineering Honor Code has long
been a mark of the integrity of the Michi-
gan Engineer. Since 1914 students here
have had the opportunity to study under
this Code and assume the responsibilities
which it offers—to be honest when judg-
ing one's self and others. To aid this
judgment, the Honor Council was estab-
lished to function as a judicial and edu-
cational body of students.
When violations of the Honor Code
are reported, either by students or the
faculty, the Council meets with those in
question to determine their guilt or in-
nocence. The student is helped to under-
stand how and why he has made his
mistakes and is assisted in correcting
them. An individual should know that he
is not being punished unjustly; but that
by violating the Honor Code, he has
harmed himself, his friends, and his Col-
lege. If he realizes this, the student is not
likely to repeat his violation.
Besides the judicial function, it is the
Council's responsibility to make sure every
member of the student body understands
fully the principles of the Code. Each
year members of the Council speak to in-
coming freshmen and transfers to acquaint
them with the Code and answer their
questions. Also from time to time, the
Council booklet is revised to meet new
policy that the students wish to be in-
corporated in the operation of their
Honor Code.
The Honor Council consists of nine
students: four are chosen every semester
for a year term and one is appointed by
Vulcans. The applicant fills out a peti-
tion containing his reasons for desiring
membership and possible means for im-
proving the Code. This petition is then
discussed during a ten-minute interview
between the applicant and the Honor
Council. Anyone with a 2.00 overall in
the Engineering College is eligible for
membership. Petitioning dates are in De-
cember and May, and notices will appear
to that effect on the Honor Council Bulle-
tin board in the vestibule of West Engi-
neering Building. There is a list of cur-
rent Council members posted on this
board at all times, so that anyone desiring
more information can feel free to call.
Further information may be obtained
from Arnold Brown at NOrmandy
3-3991.
To readily understand the great re-
sponsibilities vested in the Honor Coun-
cil, it should be known that the body is
entirely student run and is not under the
direct supervision of the Faculty. All de-
cisions are final unless an appeal is filed
with the Faculty Disciplinary Board. In
the 41 years of the Council's existence,
none of its decisions has ever been re-
versed.
The Honor Council feels that it pos-
sesses among the most important and
valuable opportunities which Campus life
at Michigan offers. One cannot only gain
experience in judging people but also can
have the satisfaction of helping correct
the faults that can hinder them in later
life. Think seriously when considering
campus activity and "PETITION YOUR
HONOR COUNCIL."
Phi Lambda Upsilon
Phi Lambda Upsilon is the national
honorary society for those excelling in the
fields of chemistry, chemical engineering,
and allied fields where chemistry is pre-
dominant. The Michigan Delta Chapter
of PLU was founded in 1909; the first
chapter at the University of Illinois was
founded in 1899.
Each year, as part of its activities at
Michigan, PLU Delta Chapter awards a
reference type book to the junior in
Chemical Engineering and Chemistry with
the highest grade point average. Although
primarily an honorary organization with
the purpose of promoting superior schol-
arship and achievement in pure and ap-
plied chemistry, PLU's calendar also in-
cludes several social events during the
year. Each spring a banquet is held in
honor of the new initiates of that year,
who are invited to join during both the
fall and spring semesters.
AIEE-IRE
The American Institute of Electrical
Engineers and the Institute of Radio
Engineers are organizations which pro-
mote programs to aid students and grad-
uates of Electrical Engineering to keep
abreast of the latest in their profession.

already started"
"You would need a computer to figure out how many
phases of engineering and science go into the making
of one type of airplane or missile. Aerodynamics, ther-
modynamics, jet propulsion, electronics, communica-
tions, even anthropology... and these are just a few.
Such a diversity of fields means unlimited opportunity,
whether you intend to specialize or not.
"You know it's never too early to select your field.
You seniors have started to think about where your
experience can do the most for you: but the juniors
and lower-classmen should also be selecting courses
that will give them the training they need for the job
they want. Actually, your future has already started.
"So, my advice is that you start thinking about the
aircraft industry. It offers the greatest opportunities...
opportunity to use your training, to advance, to make
a comfortable living. It's still a young industry and it
thrives on and encourages young ideas'.'
Scenes like this are taking place on campuses all over
the country. Engineering professors must keep up
with scientific advances. They realize that these ad-
vances mean added opportunity for soon-to-graduate
students. Research in the aircraft industry has
uncovered so many areas for further study that young
men are urgently needed to solve these problems. Long
a pioneer in new facets of aviation, Northrop is one of
the companies that wants such aggressive young men.
At Northrop you can put your training to work on
the Snark SM-62, the world's first intercontinental
guided missile. And new projects like the twin jet,
supersonic trainer, the USAF-Northrop T-38, and
others of top priority are moving ahead steadily.
Products are only as good as the engineers behind
them and good engineers require good surroundings.
In line with this thinking, Northrop has built a multi-
million-dollar Engineering and Science Center in
Hawthorne, California, that is as modern as any in the
industry. Here, you will be working with leading
engineers who respect your individuality, initiative and
engineering abilities. In addition, at Northrop you will
receive added benefits that are among the finest in the
industry.
Why not write us now... regardless of your class at
college. Ask us questions about how you might best
gain a career with Northrop. Write to Manager of

local student branch.
Membership is open to all EE's. Dues
are fifty cents per semester in the student

ASTE
The American Society of Tool Engi-
neers (ASTE) like every other profes-
sional organization active in the engineer-
ing college exists solely for the profes-
sional benefit of its student members. To-
ward this aim a group of programs of
technical interest are planned each year.
This year the dominating topic is of
special interest to you the young engineer
—namely automation. With the increas-
ing influence of the push-button the sci-
ence of automation and its application is
becoming ever more significant in the
field of manufacturing. The student chap-
ter feels that it is especially important for
the student engineer to realize and appre-
ciate industry's viewpoint on such topics
of general interest. Experts in this field of
automation will present industry's view
point in our program for 1957-58.
The second important function of any
student professional society is to help you
to meet your instructors on an informal
social basis. This is well implemented by
weekly luncheons, where, around a re-
laxed atmosphere of hot soup and sand-
wiches and generally a movie or talk by
a faculty member, students can meet and
talk with their instructors on topics of
common interest. Check the bulletin
boards for exact time and place.
Programs of this nature provide a val-
uable addition to the routine class sched-
ule and a broader out-look in your
engineering career. It's time well spent.
For Membership information contact Jim
Hardy at NO 53471.
ASCE
Professional recognition is the goal
which every man, following a chosen pro-
fession, hopes to obtain. This goal is ob-
tained through a process of professional
development which normally has its be-
ginning with enrollment in college. It is
important to recognize at this time that a
well-balanced professional growth is de-
rived from two distinctly different but
equally important sources. For the engi-
neer the first is technological in nature
and the second is humanistic. The first
pertains to the attainment of a back-
ground of technical knowledge, experi-
ence, and skill; the second promotes a
philosophy which creates a spirit of loy-
alty to the profession, a sense of moral
obligation to mankind, and an apprecia-
tion of the impact of technology on so-
ciety. The student follows the first path-
way naturally because it is prescribed. The
second he must find through voluntary
contributions of public service and as-
sociation with organizations of his pro-
fession.
The Student Chapters of the American
Society of Civil Engineers provide the op-
portunity for the beginnings of profes-
sional associations. Membership in a chap-
ter assures that contacts can be made with
the technical aand professionl progress of
civil engineering and with the leaders
who are responsible for such progress.
Even more important, membership offers
the chance to take part in the constructive
activities carried on by future leaders of
the profession.
Student chapter meetings, held semi-
monthly, are given over to outside speak-
ers on technical or professional subjects.
Movies and slides presented at chapter
meetings give practical understanding of
engineering projects which are augmented
by field trips to points of engineering in-
terest.
Throughout the school year, organized
conferences of student chapters provide
opportunity for broadening outlook and
acquaintance. Sponsored by chapters, or
groups of chapters, the conferences are
held in cities or on campuses where ade-
quate facilities are provided for both
professional sessions and social activity.
Those Civil Engineering students who
wish membership in the Society should
contact Professor R. B. Harris, 313 West
Engineering Building or attend one of
the chapter meetings. The time and place
of these meetings will be posted on the
Civil Engineering bulletin board located
across from room 305 in the West Engi-
neering Building.
Sigma Rho Tau
Sigma Rho Tau is the national engi-
neering speech society organized twenty-
six years ago on this campus for the
purpose of helping engineers to learn
how to express their ideas more effective-
ly through the spoken word. Since 1929,
it has grown to four chapters.
It is generally agreed among men in
all fields of business that engineers who
are able to get ideas across clearly are
valuable. The young engineer will find
plenty of opportunity to practice public
speaking by attending the weekly meet-
ings of Sigma Rho Tau. He will be given
the oportunity to practice and develop
public speaking ability both here at the
University and in intercollegiate contests.
Sigma Rho Tau hopes to impress upon
the young engineer the importance of
skill and mastery in speech as well as the
slide rule. Engineers must be able to
communicate convincingly in daily con-
tacts with fellow workers.
The Alpha chapter of Sigma Rho Tau
welcomes the freshman engineering class
to the University of Michigan and cor-
dially invites them and any other mem-
bers of the engineering college to attend
their Tuesday night meetings.
The Michigan Technic
The Michigan Technic, oldest publica-
tion on the Michigan campus and last
year awarded "First in General Excel-
lence" among engineering college maga-
zines throughout the country, affords the
engineer an opportunity to combine his
journalistic interests with an engineering
curriculum.

THE MOST FORGETTABLE CHARAC-
TER I HAVE EVER MET
Whenever I think back to my youth
and wistfully review my formative years,
the image of one man looms in my mind.
Amid the general, fuzzy darkness of my
memories of this period, the figure of this
man, Sam Grisner, stands shrouded in
the even fuzzier gloom. I roomed with
this man in college for two years. At the
end of that time I could barely remem-
ber what he looked like and had trouble
calling his name to mind. For Sam Gris-
ney—Grisnel, that is—had a very rare
personality type, the type which totally
fails to impinge on the consciousness of
other people.
Because of this I had a very embarrass-
ing two years. When someone entered my
room and asked how many roommates I
had, I would sometimes forgetfully reply
that I was living in a single. Then Grit-
ner—I mean Gritney—would come out
and I would introduce him as my room-
mate. Or, whenever my friends and I
would go out somewhere with Gram, we
would invariably forget that he had come
with us and drive off without him. In the
course of two years we must have strand-
ed him at least twenty-five times.
Griswald finally decided to leave me
after a blast I threw toward the end of
the second year. On that evening, I kept
forgetting which of my guests had met
him and which not, and similarly, my
guests could not remember from one min-
ute to the next whether they had been
introduced to him. And so I introduced
him at least three times to each guest,
practically each time by a different name.
He lingered on for the rest of the year
and then moved out.
After those two years I never saw
Grimney again. During the time at col-
lege when I was being shaped and mold-
ed from all sides, this man had absolutely
no effect on me whatever, not one iota
of influence. It is only by virtue of his
unusual nothingness that I remember that
he existed at all. He was a nonentity, a
zero.

An elderly lady driving nonchalantly
along turned a corner and ran down a
poor inebriate crossing the street. Without
any show of emotion, she stopped the car,
rolled down the window and called, "You
had better watch out there, young man."
The drunk rose on his elbows and yell-
ed, "Ye Gods, lady, don't tell me you're
going to back up."

Prof: "Well, is the theory clear to you
now?"
Student: "Yeah, just as though it had
been translated into Hindustani by Ger-
trude Stein and read to me by a tobacco
auctioneer."

A little boy had been climbing the tree
in his back yard. For the second time, he
came in with his trousers torn.
"Go upstairs and mend them yourself,"
ordered his mother.
Some time later she went up to see how
he was progressing. The trousers were
there, but no sign of the child. Puzzled,
she came downstairs and noticed that the
cellar door, usually closed, was open. She
went over to the door and cried angrily.
"Are you running around down there
without any pants on?"
"No ma'am," came the reply, "I am
reading the electric meter."

bama to Canada, and from New York to
Washington.
2 years: Gag writer for a radio pro-
gram finds local college magazine on a

TAT « TAT The Allegheny stainless
and super high-temperature steels used in
jet and rocket aircraft engines and equip-
ment are pure economy, Decause they do
the job that's required of them, and they
last! They stand up under metal-killing con-
ditions of heat, load and corrosion, and
they're dependable.
There are lots of other jobs for stainless
Steel that aren't as spectacular, or perhaps as
tough, as those aboard a jet. Hospital, dairy
and restaurant equipment are good examples,
or the many uses in cars, trains, appliances,
buildings and homes.
But, in these and thousands of other cases,
Stainless again gets the call because it does
the job better, lasts longer and costs less in
the long run than any other material on
the market.
There may be many occasions in your
industrial future when Allegheny Stainless
and other special steels can help you either
to make money or to save it. Or you may
decide to make our career yours: the develop-
ment and engineering of stainless and heat-

ERMA is stupid as computers are rated,
it is extremely useful in the operation for
which it was designed. And it is far
less expensive than Univac or the other
multipurpose machines.
Administrative Automation
Sylvania, a firm which manufactures
electronic components has lead the way in
establishing administrative automation. In
the next four years a private wire "nerv-
ous system" connecting the firm's 55 lo-
cations in 51 cities and 19 states will be
opened. A Univac computer will be the
"brains" of this communications system.
It will compute and print all payrolls on
its high-speed printers. Also the machine
will keep a constant inventory of parts
and products. Previous inventories were
usually just estimates mailed in by depart-
ments and took considerable time but the
Univac will have a complete one available
in a few minutes. Finally, Sylvania offi-
cials plan to use their computer as a com-
plete accounting and statistics center, rent-
ing time to small engineering firms and
universities.
Program Procedures
Computers often are used to decide
how to distribute available funds, man-
power, equipment, etc., to maximize one
effect such as speed or minimize another
such as cost. For these purposes, the Air
Material Command of the Air Force has
installed two computers and ordered five
more. And the Army Quartermaster
Corps awards contracts with computers.
The machines consider variables such as
shipping costs, substitute items, allocation
to different regions of the country, and
state of inventory.
Elaborate Engineering Calculations
Computers have greatly sped up solu-
tion of complex engineering problems.
No United States bomber designed during
World War II flew during that war; all
combat bombers were designed before the
war began. Part of the reason for this
situation was the slowness of ordinary
aeronautical computations. But now com-
puters, chiefly analog, are rapidly solving
problems like stress estimates in transfer-
ring a design from a model to a full size
aircraft. And recently an engineering firm
needed a solution to 4,000 equations of
4,000 unknowns. They rented a couple
of computers for an hour and had their
results immediately.
Future of Computers
Several bold new applications of com-
puters are in the trial stage and they seem
to revolutionize old fields. Only recently
a computer has been used to translate lan-
guages (Russian to English) and great
developments are possible here. A flying
spot scanner, (mentioned under input de-
vices) would make such a computer al-
most as valuable as a human interpreter.
Weather prediction by computer has pro-
duced good results and ambitious plans
are under way to greatly improve it. Eco-
nomic necessity will eventually force all
large companies to secure computers. And
computers are making automation systems
practical, both on the industrial and ad-
ministrative level. Furthermore, the fed-
eral government is securing dozens of
computers for military and civilian tasks.
Applied mathematics is being mechan-
ized; the Age of Computers has just be-
gun.

Why Vought Projects
Bring Out The Best
In An Engineer
At Vought, the engineer doesn't often
forget past assignments. Like all big
events, they leave vivid memories.
And it's no wonder
For here the engineer contributes to
history-making projects — among
them the record-breaking Crusader
fighter; the Regulus II missile, chosen
to arm our newest nuclear subs; and
the new fast-developing 1,500-plus-
mph fighter, details of which are still
classified.
The Vought engineer watches such
weapons take shape. He supervises
critical tests, and he introduces the
weapons to the men with whom they
will serve.
Engineers with many specialties share
these experiences. Today, for exam-
ple, Vought is at work on important
projects involving:
electronics design and manufacture
inertial navigation
investigation of advanced propulsion
methods
Mach 5 configurations
Vought's excellent R&amp;D facilities
help the engineer through unexplored
areas. And by teaming up with other
specialists against mutual challenges,
the Vought engineer learns new fields
while advancing in his own.

edge of the product they are selling and
are instructed to say, "I don't know the
answer to your question, but I will find
out and let you know," when they run
into such problems.
This method is excellent with one ex-
ception; it is very aggravating to the pros-
pective client to hear this as the sales
engineer's only answer to his question.
Many a chief engineer has stated, "If that
fellow doesn't know anything about the
product he is selling, then why is he sent
out to waste my time?" You can readily
see that a sales engineer requires years
of basic engineering on the product,
back in the drafting room, before he can
go out with some real information for his
customer.
Most companies today adjust salaries
so that sales engineers and development
or design engineers make comparable sal-
aries during any period of their careers.
Two men starting for a company taking
different paths of engineering should
make comparable salaries, and the paths
they take should be determined by their
personalities and abilities rather than by
their desires to make more money.
Why Choose Engineering?
You should have a genuine desire to
create and develop new ideas and prod-
ucts. You should find a real satisfaction
in being able to develop a new idea into
a finished product, small or large, and
should be critical enough to say: "This
does what it was intended to do, but what
are its weakest points? And how can 1
redesign it to strengthen those points and
make a more efficient and more service-
able product?" Here your storehouse of
knowledge comes into action; your school-
ing, your observations, your experience,
all working in unison to find a better so-
lution if one as available. As a good engi-
neer you will feel proud and will have a
real sense of satisfaction in developing
and completing projects of this sort, for
you will know within yourself that you
have created something new to help
yourself and your fellow man.

Karl Bausch, Chief Electrical Engineer,
Power Division of the Bechtel Corporation.
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
One of a series of interviews in which
Bechtel Corporation executives discuss
career opportunities for college men.
Question: Mr. Bausch, in con-
sidering a position with Bechtel, or
any other firm, isn't it true that what
most college men want to know first
of all is "What will I be doing?"
Bausch: That's true, and it isn't an
easy question to answer. So much de-
pends on individual preferences and
abilities and the way a man develops.
On joining us, he would be asked if
he'd like to work on the drafting
board doing layout work. As an
alternate, he might prefer a starting
assignment involving helping out on
calculations, requisitioning materials,
writing specifications, etc.
Question: In other words you try to
give the new man some freedom of
choice?
Bausch: As far as possible. We
know that the beginning period is a
difficult one. It takes some time for
him to get his feet on the ground and
we try to "expose" him to many dif-
ferent activities. In that way he gets
needed experience and familiarity
that help him decide the work for
which he feels best qualified. It also
gives us the opportunity to evaluate
his potential.
Question: Assuming a man shows
the necessary ability and begins to
produce, how does he branch out?
Bausch: Generally, in either of two
ways. He may work on the electrical
portion of power plants, designing
circuits, control and relaying systems,
unit protection, etc. The other way is
on the physical layout of power plants
—that is, location of equipment, con-
duit and raceway systems, etc. In
either case he would be put in charge
of one section of the project.
Question: And his next advance
would be...?
Bausch: Assuming he progresses
satisfactorily, he would ultimately
move into a lead job as a group
supervisor in charge of the design of
the electrical system of the complete
plant.
Question: Could you give an
estimate of the time involved in the
various steps?
Bausch: That's impossible. We have
no hard and fast schedule. In general,
we have found that it takes a man
about a year to get his feet on the
ground and become a real producer.
From that point on, it's up to him.
Question: In other words, he can
advance in keeping with his indivi-
dual ability?
Bausch: That's right. Of course,
there are many other factors in-
volved, including the vitally impor-
tant one of the great advancements

part shown above. That's a 42% increase in rate of pro-
duction over the previous B&amp;S model.
One of many new features that contribute to the re-
markable performance of the 00 machine is a chain
driven ball bearing spindle (diagram). Fafnir engineers
worked with Brown &amp; Sharpe in selecting bearings for
this application, involving some 208 spindle speed com-
binations ranging from 34 to 7200 RPM. To assure
absolute spindle rigidity and running accuracy, Fafnir
super-precision ball bearings are mounted in the posi-
tions indicated.
Thousands of similar bearing success stories help ex-
plain why design engineers turn to Fafnir for help with
bearing problems. The Fafnir Bearing Company, New

PASSING THE BUCK
The college professor says:
"Such rawness in a student is a shame,
But high school preparation is to
blame."
The high school teacher remarks:
"From such youth I should be spared,
They send them up so unprepared.''
The grammer school teacher observes:
"A cover for the dunces stool-—
Why was he ever sent to school?"
The kindergarten teacher whispers:
"Never such lack of training did I
see—
What kind of person must the mother
be."
The mother replies:
"Poor child, but he is not to blame.
His father's folks were all the same."
"The more I think about going out and
getting a job the more I think about stay-

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS AT JPL
The Jet Propulsion Labora-
tory is a stable research and
development center located
north of Pasadena in the
foothills of the San Gabriel
mountains. Covering an 80
acre area and employing
2000 people, it is close to
attractive residential areas.
The Laboratory is staffed by
the California Institute of
Technology and develops its
many projects in basic re-
search under contract with
the U.S. Government.
Opportunities open to quali-
fied engineers of U.S. citizen-
ship. Inquiries now invited.
JOB OrPOtTUNITItS
IN THESE FIUOS NOW
Weapons Systems Responsibility
In the development of guided missile
systems, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
maintains a complete and broad respon-
sibility. From the earliest conception to
production engineering—from research
and development in electronics, guidance,
aerodynamics, structures and propulsion,
through field testing problems and actual
troop use, full technical responsibility rests
with JPL engineers and scientists.
The Laboratory is not only responsible for
the missile system itself, including guid-
ance, propulsion and airframe, but for all
ground handling equipment necessary to
insure a complete tactical weapons system.
One outstanding product of this type of
systems responsibility is the "Corporal,"
a highly accurate surface-to-surface ballis-
tic missile. This weapon, developed by JPL,
and now in production elsewhere, can be
found "on active service" wherever needed
in the American defense pattern.
A prime attraction for scientists and
engineers at JPL is the exceptional oppor-
tunity provided for original research
afforded by close integration with vital and
forward-looking programs. The Laboratory
now has important positions open for
qualified applicants for such interesting
and challenging activities.

(Continued from page 64)
Having celebrated its 75th birthday last
year, the Technic has for years presented
the most current engineering news from
industry as well as research and student
activities at Michigan. A staff of 30
undergraduates publish the magazine
monthly, October through May.
Each year a tryout program allows new
staff members to learn any or all phases
of the magazine's operation—writing,
illustrating, business, or production. No
previous journalistic experience is neces-
sary, and the office is open every after-
noon for prospective staffers to drop in
and look around.
Alpha Pi Mu
Alpha Pi Mu is the undergraduate
industrial engineering honorary. Char-
tered on this campus in February of
1957, the group now consists of 14
juniors and seniors enrolled in the de-
partment of industrial engineering. It is
the only group representative of the in-
dustrial engineering students and strives
to recognize those industrials who fulfill
its requirements of ethicality, sociability,
character, and academic achievement.
Those eligible for election to this
honorary are the juniors in industrial
engineering in the upper quarter of
their class and the seniors in the upper
third. New members are elected every
November and April.
In its initial year, Alpha Pi Mu
worked on the industrial engineering
display for the engineering open house
last April. The group also sponsored a
Cinema Guild movie during the year.
This coming year promises many en-
thusiastic undertakings for the horonary.
A list will be compiled of the employ-
ment opportunities on campus available
to undergraduate industrials. An effort
will be made by Alpha Pi Mu to bring
the faculty and the students of industrial
engineering closer together at informal
social gatherings. In addition, a survey
will be conducted by the members of
the honorary to have the students of in-
dustrial engineering evaluate the courses
offered in the program.
Tau Beta Pi
"The Tau Beta Pi Association was
founded at Lehigh University in 1885
Noble cleaning efforts of the Triangles.
by Edward Higginson Williams, Jr., to
mark in a fitting manner those who
have conferred honor upon their Alma
Mater by distinguished scholarship and
exemplary character as undergraduates
in engineering, or by their attainments
as alumni in the field of engineering,
and to foster a spirit of liberal culture
in the engineering colleges of America"
—Preamble to the Constitution of Tau
Beta Pi.
Recognition of distinguished scholar-
ship and exemplary character is not the
only function of Tau Beta Pi, a national
engineering honor society. Beyond that,
it is a service organization with respon-
sibilities to the school and the com-
munity. Many different worthwhile pro-
jects have been undertaken by Tau Beta
Pi chapters throughout the country, in-
cluding tutoring services for underclass-
men, faculty evaluation, and many
others. Michigan Gamma chapter, here
at the University of Michigan, has also
supplied guides for the Engineering
Centennial and Open Houses, and is
currently developing a program for
helping to acquaint foreign engineering
students with the Michigan campus.
Tau Beta Pi is also the source of life-
time friendships and associations for its
members. The business and social meet-
ings provide a time for working with,
and enjoying the fellowship of, men
from all branches of engineering—a
wealth of experience. Only upperclass-
men are eligible to become members of
Tau Beta Pi, but the honor and recog-
nition of being a member is a goal that
an engineering undergraduate would not
be unwise in establishing early in his
college career.
Vulcans—Senior Engineering
Honor Society
Vulcans is the senior engineering hon-
orary society for men. It was founded in
1904 for the purpose of recognizing
achievements in scholastic and extracur-
ricular activities. The membership totals
about twenty seniors, who are tapped dur-
ing their junior or senior year.
Vulcan activities center around the
Vulcan room, located in the tower of the

Vulcans initiation.
Michigan Union. Since the group con-
sists of seniors who are active in other
organizations, it is natural that a great
deal of time is spent in discussion of
problems and projects for both the En-
gineering College and the entire Campus.
However, since the organization is hon-
orary, no public stand is taken on any
issue.
Vulcans is also a service organiza-
tion, having in the past done charitable
work for hospitals and provided support
for the Engineering Honor Council. At
the present time there are Vulcan funds
set aside for a scholarship and for aid
to other groups who are in need of
emergency assistance.
The Vulcan social calendar is an im-
portant part of the group's activity. Each
year several parties are held and every
June the Vulcans end their college year
with a steak fry.
Triangles Honorary
Within the limits of the Engineering
Arch can be found the seal of Triangles,
an honorary society of Junior Engineers.
At the end of each semester the robed
members of the society seek out and tap
those men of the aproaching Junior En-
gineering Class who are outstanding lead-
ers in varsity athletics or extra-curricular
activities.
At present, there are twelve mem-
bers, however each year there is a com-
plete turnover and the membership is
often as high as twenty. Each neophyte
must go through a rigid initiation, the
highlight of which is scrubbing the Arch
donned in the traditional dunce caps and
ragged clothing. Following this, the or-
ganization is taken over by the new men.
The purpose of the organization is to
bring these men together so that they
might work to further student-faculty
relations, promote interest in their activ-
ities, discuss mutual academic and social
problems, and in general, serve the cam-
pus in any other way possible.
Various projects and meetings are held
to permit the accomplishment of these
purposes. Bi-weekly business meetings
and special discussion meetings are held.
Projects such as porter service for in-
coming women, coat check concessions at
Homecoming and the J-Hop and other
services provide funds for the organiza-
tion and at the same time serve the stu-
dent community.
Executive Class Boards
Serving as the class organizations in
the College of Engineering are the Execu-
tive Boards of the class of 1958, 1959,
I960, and soon to be organized the Class
of 1961. These Class Boards are organ-
ized to give a voice to the opinions of
the respective classes. The Boards spon-
sor and initiate activities and service
propects which have the betterment of
the class, the College, and the University
as their aims. Class organization provides
an outlet for those with qualities of
leadership, and stimulates interest and
unity not only within the class but also
within the group known as "Engineers."
The Class Boards also provide a means
of communication between the students
and the administration of both the Uni-
versity and the College of Engineering.
To these ends many of the engineers of
tomorow devote some time each week.
They work on Faculty Evaluation or a
get together with a professional engineer
of note to glean a word from the wise.
They plan mixers and social events such
as the Slide Rule Ball. They discuss the
pros and cons of a student-faculty lounge
and many other projects. These class
boards are not for the next guy to work
on—they require each student's interest.
They are open to any member of the
respective classes who is not disqualified
by a scholastic disability. Those with
little or no experience in activities have
an equal opportunity to participate as
those who have devoted much previous
time. The only qualification is sincere
interest. Officers and membership in your
class Board can be obtained by petition-
ing for nomination to the Board in the
spring elections. Many committee posts

Engineering, BME, Minnesota, '36
"The story of Honeywell, as I know it, is a story of
growth—from a thermostat to over 12,000 products;
from a handful of employees to more than 30,000;
from a basement in Minneapolis to a world-wide
organization. For Honeywell, world leader in auto-
matic controls, has expanded as rapidly as this excit-
ing field. And employment, sales and income have
increased steadily year after year.
"The future is even more challenging. Planned
diversification puts Honeywell in such new fields as
office and factory automation, process control, plas-
tics, atomic energy, electronics, missiles and satel-
lites. Whole new areas of opportunity are waiting
for today's engineering graduates in each of Honey-
well's divisions. Here are some division representa-
tives to tell you about them."
CORPORATE RESEARCH
HOPKINS, MINNESOTA
Dr. Finn Larsen, PhD,

"Our Research Center is a focal point
for Honeywell's over-all research
program. Here, Honeywell scientists
and engineers conduct basic research
into areas such as Heat Transfer, Met-
allurgy, Thermodynamics, Solar En-
ergy, Radioactivity, Electronics, etc.
This research supplements other re-
search carried on by Honeywell's sep-
arate divisions, plays an important
part in the company's development
program. There's certainly plenty of
opportunity for the imaginative
scientist or engineer here."

"In the past six years our engineer-
ing force has trebled through our
expansion into such advanced fields
as inertial guidance, jet engine con-
trol, computers, fire control and
bombing systems, fuel management,
and precision gyros. We have devel-
oped and produced more autopilots
than any other manufacturer, and
built the reference system for the
Earth Satellite Rocket. The diver-
sity and wide acceptance of our prod-
ucts indicates the boundless oppor-
tunities we have for engineers and
scientists."

ination into maintaining Americi's
technological lead. We work in such
new fields as infrared sensors, mis-
siles, servo mechanisms, new types
of turret control systems. We've de-
veloped proximity and mechanical
fuzes, antiaircraft fire control sys-
tems, underwater warfare equipment
and other products in widely diver-
sified fields. Our more advanced
products, naturally, are still classified,
but they offer outstanding challenges
and opportunities."

Director of Product Research
"Products of our Micro Switch Di-
vision help giant aircraft land safely,
interlock machine tool operations,
feed instructions into electronic com-
puters. These are just a few of their
applications—applications which are
growing year after year. The devel-
opment of these precision switches
requires high engineering skill, puts a
premium on your imagination, offers
you tremendous opportunities for
advancement and recognition."
RESIDENTIAL, RETAIL AND

"We specialize almost entirely in
comfort control. Typical of the ad-
vances our division has made re-
cently is the Supervisory Data Center*
which enables one man in one loca-
tion to read and control the tempera-
ture of every room in a large building.
Our other new products include Air

Vice President and Gen. Mgr.
"No company in the fast growing in-
strumentation field is growing faster
than Honeywell's Industrial Instru-
ments Division. There's practically
no physical quantity under the sun
that Honeywell instruments cannot
measure, and, in most cases, control,
from open hearth furnaces to com-
plex processes still on the designer's
boards. Finding new applications
and designing the instruments, com-
puters and read-out devices of to-
morrow, offer you a fascinating
present and an unlimited future."
S. A. Keller, BS,
U. of Pennsylvania, 1941
General Manager
"This division of Honeywell manu-
factures two different classes of prod-
ucts: Instruments and Photographic
Equipment. Our recording oscillo-
graphs—typified by the radically
new 'Visicorder'—are used in a wide
range of industrial, scientific, and
military applications. Our famous
'Strobonar' electronic flash equip-
ment is used by 5 out of 6 news-
papers and all important press serv-
ices. The variety of products and
markets of the Heiland Division
promises an ever-expanding field that
challenges young engineers."
This is Honeywell: more than
12,000 highly engineered prod-
ucts, 14 separate divisions, loca-
tions sprinkled throughout this
country and abroad, projects by
the hundreds on the outposts of
every major technological ad-
vance. It's a land of opportunity

Here is a rathj^^i&amp;y one to start off
with:
Connect all the dots using only four
straight lines, which intersect but once,
without removing the pencil from the
paper.
A tough army sergeant, with a new
group of inductees, was particularly
harassed by five college men. Attempt-
ing to discontinue their annoyances, he
devised an experiment to test their in-
telligence. He marched the five men to
the parade grounds and commanded
them into a column with each man
facing in the same direction towards the
head of the column. Upon each man's
head the sergeant placed either a white
or a red hat. Now the men could not
see the color of their own hat, but they
could, of course, see the color of the
hats of the men in front of them. The
sergeant announced that altogether there
were three red and two white hats.
He first asked the middle man if he
could possibly determine the color of his
own hat to which this man replied neg-
ative. The soldier standing in front of
the middle man was then asked. He also
replied it was impossible for him to
solve the color. When the first man was
questioned, he responded that he knew
the color of his own hat. Assuming
that the first two men questioned by the
sergeant could not possibly ascertain the
color of their own hat, what was the
color of the hat of the first man and
how did he know?
Here's another snap. Rearrange any

ODE TO A HAPPY CIVIL ENGINEER
I stood on the bridge at midnight,
A simple Pratt-truss span,
And my hands were held fixed-ended
In the clasp of my love—dear Ann.
And I sighed as I there surveyed her,
My love so passing fair.
While a sportive wind-loaded sudden
Caused tensile strength in her hair.
"Ann, wilt thou walk beside me
Along Life's hard-surfaced road?
On my rig's spiral reinforcement
My heart set up an impact load."
"Oh, Ann, beam thou upon my life;
I pray thee not to dim it."
And my joy, as she softly whispered
"Yes."
Exceeded the elastic limit.
He was one of those professors who,
always anxious to improve their course,
add as their last question of their final
exam, "What have you thought of this
course?"
At the end of one of his worst papers
he found this comment: "I think that
this was a very well-roundeed course.
Everything not given in class during the
semester has been included in the final ex-
amination.

Physicists have a little humorous
puzzle which asks: How can you prove
that the temperature of Hell is uniform?
The answer is that if the temperature
were not the same at every point then
some physicist in Hell (it is always con-
ceded that there will be plenty of physic-
ists available there) would set up a heat
engine which would use this difference
of temperature as a means of making
energy available. This physicist would
then use this energy to run a refrigeration
device which would cool down some
place in Hell until it was at a com-
fortable temperature. But it is contra-
dictory to the basic notion of Hell for any
spot in it to be comfortable. Thus one
concludes, by a classical reductio and
absurdum that the assumed difference in
temperature can't exist. Hell is at a uni-
form temperature.

of Mind" Saturday Review.

ENGINEER S LAMENT
Keep on studying, get no sleep
Soon you're looking like a creep;
Coffee flows, aspirin too,
Seems your eyes are full of glue;
Stress and strain, calculus,
Find the unknown, must not full.
Temper short, work with droop,
Keep on feeling like a stupe,
Paper spread upon the floor,
"Quiet Please" pinned on the door.
Books are stacked in towering pile,
Wonder if it's worth the while,
Toss a coin, decide the crams,
Heads, the army; tails, exams.

The Arch
On November 28, 1955, the Editor-in-
Chief of the Michigan Technic, Sheldon
Levin, published a College of Engineer-
ing gazette with the following objectives
in mind: first, to keep students abreast
of College of Engineering current events,
second, to create better school spirit.
The Arch is supported entirely by its
advertisers. Copies are distributed free of
charge to all students and faculty mem-
bers in the College of Engineering. Last
year fourteen issues were edited and dis-
tributed. This coming year this number
is to be increased to sixteen. In the near
future it expects to be putting out an
issue every week. In each of its issues
an attempt is made to achieve a good
balance of college functions, current en-
gineering news, people, jokes, and adver-
tising.
The Arch holds an annual banquet at
which time staff members are presented
with certificates as a tribute to their work
on the paper. Informal gatherings are
also sometimes held. The Arch offers its
staff an excellent opportunity to do some-
thing for their school and also provides
opportunity for them to meet faculty
members, colleagues, and some of the at-
tractive co-eds on both the Technic and
Arch staffs. Several positions are open,
and all are welcomed to petition. For
further information contact J. C. Boehr-
inger, 520 Hill St., NO-55303 or drop
in at 3505 East Engineering and leave
your name, address, and phone number

START TODAY TO
PLAN TOMORROW
By knowing about some of the projects underway at the
Babcock &amp; Wilcox Company, an engineer may see his
personal avenues of growth and advancement. For today
B&amp;W stands poised at a new era of expansion and
development.
Here's an indication of what's going on at B&amp;W, with
the consequent opportunities that are opening up for
engineers. The Boiler Division is building the world's
largest steam generator. The Tubular Products Division
recently introduced extruded seamless titanium tubing,
one result of its metallurgical research. The Refractories
Division developed the first refractory concrete that will
withstand temperatures up to 3200 F. The Atomic Energy
Division is under contract by the AEC to design and
build the propulsion unit of the world's first nuclear-
powered cargo vessel.
These are but a few of the projects — not in the plan-
ning stage, but in the actual design and manufacturing
phases — upon which B&amp;W engineers are now engaged.
The continuing, integrated growth of the company offers
engineers an assured future of leadership.
How is the company doing right now? Let's look at one
line from the Annual Stockholders' Report.

year terms. Any student scholastically
eligible may petition, and underclassmen
are particuarly encouraged to position
for one of these posts.
At present the Council is working on
three very important projects. The first is
the proposed student-faculty lounge. The
Council has been working for several
semesters to obtain the necessary space
and facilities for this project and this
semester it looks as though the lounge
will become a reality. The main problem
facing this project is the need for class-
room space which, of course-, makes
space for a lounge difficult to find. The
Slide Rule Ball is the second project
keeping the Council busy. This dance is
scheduled for Saturday night, Nov. 2nd
and will be the big social event of the
year for the Engineering College. The
third project, but certainly not the least
important, is the scheduling of an im-
portant speaker for the Engineers' Meet-
ing.
In the above mentioned activities as
well as all the other activities, the Coun-
cil attempts to work closely with both
the college administration and faculty
groups so that what is accomplished has
the maximum value and meaning for ad-
ministration, faculty, and students.
The Institute of the Aeronautical
Sciences
The Institute of the Aeronautical Sci-
ences is the representative society for
engineers, scientists, designers and tech-
nical specialists in all the aspects related
to the science of flight and the design of
airborne craft. Its basic mission is to
facilitate by all available means the inter-
change of technical ideas among aero-
nautical engineers throughout the world.
Student membership was established
by the Institute to provide the student
engineer or scientist with broad oppor-
tunities to engage in activities associated
with their future career in practical as
well as scientific aspects of aeronautics.
As a student member, one will find
that the I.A.S. is eager to contribute to
his professional advancement ... by pro-
moting his knowledge of aeronautical
sciences ... by encouraging professional
consciousness and fellowship . . . and
most of all by helping him to establish
a solid foundation upon which he will
form and build his career in the years
ahead.
The Student Branch here at Michigan
sponsors regularly scheduled technical
meetings which include guest lecturers,
film showings, field trips to aeronautical
indust.ies and Government laboratories,
and an annual picnic with the Aeronaut-
ical Engineering faculty. The Student
Branch of this University has established
a record of active as well as successful
participation in the annual Regional
Conferences which afford student mem-
bers an opportunity to present papers in
competition for cash awards. First Award
papers, graduate and undergraduate from
each conference, are published annually.
Student members may subscribe at
special rates to the Aeronautical Engi-
neering Review and the Journal of the
Aeronautical Sciences. After graduation
any student member will automatically
qualify for transfer to Associate Mem-
bership in the Institute, the usual en-
trance fee and requirement of references
being waived.
Chi Epsilon
"Chi Epsilon was founded in the year
1923 on the campus of the University of
Illinois. Its objective and purpose were
then, and continue to be, to contribute to
the improvement of the engineering pro-
fession by fostering the development and
exercise of fundamentally sound traits of
character and technical ability among
undergraduate civil engineers. Chi Epsilon
in contributing to such a development
works toward producing a higher stand-
ard of service offered to humanity and
thus, results in increasing the efficiency
of the profession as an instrument of
social betterment.
This goal is met in part by placing a
mark of distinction on the undergraduate
who has upheld the honor of the Depart-
ment by high scholastic ability. The aca-
demic requirements of Chi Epsilon are
that a man becomes eligible for election
provided that he is the upper one third
of the senior class or in the upp&gt;er one
quarter of the junior class. From this list
of eligible men, the members of the so-
ciety are elected by a majority vote of the
active membership. Character traits, prac-
ticality and sociability are considered in
this voting procedure.
Chi Epsilon was installed on the cam-
pus of the University of Michigan in the
spring of 1949. It was the twenty-fifth
chapter in a rapidly spreading movement
which now totals 48 active chapters with-
in the continental limits of the United
States and a chapter at the University of
Hawaii.
Local activities are planned with a
frequency of about two week intervals
throughout the year. Basically, the meet-
ings are faculty-student get-togethers
where research and technical develop-
ments are discussed. Social gatherings are
frequently a part of the agenda. At our
semi-annual banquet, an award is made to
the outstanding sophomore in the Civil
Engineering curriculum and those men
newly elected to Chi Epsilon are intro-
duced to the Civil Engineering faculty.
The local group through pledge activities
builds models and provides teaching aids
for the staff of the Civil Engineering De-
partment. Each fall, the student group
circularizes the alumni and each spring a
news letter is sent out passing on the in-
formation gleaned to those who have left
the campus. Each fall, an alumni reunion
is held for those who care to return and
renew old acquaintances as well as to
pass on their experience to the younger
members of the profession.
These are some of the activities which
resulted in our Michigan Chapter receiv-
ing the award at the 1954 National Bien-
nial Conclave as the most outstanding
chapter in the country. We are proud of
our tradition and we are confident that
in spite of the increasingly complex na-
ture of the engineering work involved in
ministering to the needs of society, Chi
Epsilon will continue to play it's part in
strengthening the profession to meet the
challenge."

The vodka was flowing freely and Slavic faces were beaming quite noticeably. The scene was set at the
Russian Embassy Friday evening, October 4, 1957. The cocktail party which marked the last meeting of a
special week-long symposium regarding the space satellites which were to be launched during the IGY, had
been underway for some time. A hush suddenly fell as a Russian scientist mounted the rostrum and with
very little fanfare announced the Soviets had just launched the first artificial moon. His words were not
boastful or pretentious. They didn't have to be. They knew they had beaten us, and the facts would speak
for themselves.
As Dr. Fred L. Whipple, Director of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Laboratory stated, "We won the
first round with the H-Bomb—the Russians have won the second with the space satellite." And you may
rest assured that they will not sit back on their laurels at this point. They will not be satisfied until they
have planted their scarlet flag even as far as the moon and the neighboring planets.
The mixed feeling in the nation's Capital is understandable. By insisting that "there was no race and
that the Soviet satellite launching came as no surprise," the White House was merely covering up for the
inefficiencies which prevail in the entire Defense Department setup. The whole case was aptly summed
up in the words of Senator Symington (D., Mo.) when he commented, "Unless our defense polities are
promptly changed, the Soviets will move from superiority to supremacy. If that ever happens, our po-
sition will become impossible."
Since World War II, the Soviets have been constantly gaining ground, closing the once-wide gap
between their technology and ours. Today, it appears that not only has this gap closed entirely, but that it
has opened in the other direction—in other words, we are fast falling behind Russia. Check the well-known
record. The first atom bomb was set off in New Mexico in July of 1945. Four years later, President Tru-
man shook the Western world with the Disclosure on August 23 that the Reds had set off their first Atom
bomb. On November 16, 1952, the AEC announced "satisfactory" results regarding thermonuclear re-
search. Less than one year later, on August 12, 1953, Russia exploded their H-Bomb. Early in September
of this year, the Reds announced the successful firing of an ICBM. At that time, there was much specula-
tion as to the truth of the statement. The existence of the satellite should remove all doubt.
It was truly a wonderful breakthrough for science, and the Soviets are to be highly lauded. Our aim
here is not to take any credit from our competitors, but to find out why we have been caught napping twice
in the past month. Of itself, the 23-inch sphere is most harmless. Its implications, however, are most dis-
turbing. The "Sputnik" weighs a whopping 184 pounds compared to a mere 20 pounds for our own satel-
lite. This difference in weight offers two possibilities; either their equipment is extremely crude—so crude
that they require nine times the weight of ours to do the same job, or they are capable of receiving much
more information from their vehicle than we will from ours. The latter seems much more likely.
Once again, let us consider Sputnik's large size. To send each pound of artificial moon into its orbit
requires approximately 1000 pounds of rocket and fuel. At this point, elementary arithmetic will indicate a
loaded rocket grossing in excess of 90 tons. This is of gigantic size by present day standards and surely
must be capable of inter continental range. "Sputnik's" altitude of 560 miles is nearly double that of our
own projected moon, and indicates the Reds cannot be really far distant from a moon rocket.
Once again, our reasoning provides us with two possibilities when referring to the overall situation.
Either we are keeping pace with Russian developments and for "security" reasons are keeping quiet, or we
are most definitely falling behind and will continue to do so. And once again, the latter is the more rea-
sonable of the two. It would definitely be a fallacy to say this country does not possess the technical know-
how, or scientists or engineers or materials or even funds to produce such a vehicle. Our lack, however, lies
in that "bull-headed, mickey-moused" attitude which is so prevalent among Pentagon brass. Their first
concern is the particular branch of service to which each belongs. Their country ranks next. If the Army,
Navy and Air Force would stop bickering among thmselves, start pooling their missile research aand com-
mence immediately on a "crash" program, we might still have a chance. If they preserve the status quo,
we had better prepare ourselves for accepting the Communist way of life.

ARE YOU THE "IMPOSSIBLE" TYPE?
YES □ NO D
If your answer is yes, you're a Detroit Edison engineering type. The kind who'll
tackle an impossible problem—and lick it. You're not afraid to have a new idea.
You're the kind of young engineer who works hard at finding faster, more
efficient, more economical ways.
In short, you're the inquisitive, exploration-minded sort of engineer Detroit
Edison is looking for. At Edison, your assignments will be liberally sprinkled with
exciting challenges to your training and ability. And creative engineering is called
for even on ordinary jobs.
You'll enjoy a big helping of prestige when you're associated with Detroit
Edison, too. It's one of the Midwest's best-known, best-liked, most progressive
public utility companies, noted for its pioneering accomplishments and leader-
ship in America's business enterprise system. For some outside evidence of
Edison's reputation, take a look at the March 25, 1957 issue of Electrical World.
It contains eight pages, by some of America's leading electrical equipment
manufacturers, devoted to recent engineering accomplishments in Detroit. They
emphasize the important contributions Detroit Edison engineers make and will
continue to make to equipment and systems engineering and design.
Think we're stretching our story a bit? Here's your chance to find out. Drop us
a note and we'll send you a copy of "Detroit Edison Engineering"—it tells about
the challenges and opportunities waiting for you. Write to the Employment

Security—this is a big thing in our lives today. Everyone is searching for it. The new graduate, on being
interviewed, first asks what kind of pension plan the company offers, insurance plans, salary. Only later does
he inquire regarding the type of work involved and how he might fit into the organization. In the same manner,
today's teenager believes it necessary to go steady—for the security of being asked to that dance Saturday night.
Likewise, a young college man must join a fraternity, else he feels he will be left without friends, and once
again without that particular intangible—security. And this concept could be explored in a hundred more di-
rections.
So, too, has this problem crept into our national government over the years, and more particularly, the De-
partment of Defense. Security, as it is known to today's man of research, is subsidized into categories such as
classified, secret, confidential, top secret. Probably the greatest function of this setup is that it gives rubber-
stamping duties to secretaries who would otherwise be unemployed. It cannot be questioned that some vital areas
of research and development should be out of bounds for everyone not connected directly with them. Yet, this
idea of security can and definitely has been carried to extremes. This has hurt the country in the past, but it
could have vastly deeper consequences in the future.
Colonel Nickerson, whose name appeared in headlines across the country several months ago, is a prime
example of the extremes to which this belief has been extended. This man who, at various times, has been herald-
ed the Billy Mitchell of the rocket field, was completetely and entirely devoted to his country. Yet his court-
martial was based on this country's outmoded and impractical security regulations. If people in the Pentagon
had listened to him, the situation in which this country finds itself today might not exist.
It must be realized that the Russians are not all thumbs—an idea which has prevailed for too long a
period. Their scientists are far from stupid and in many military phases of scientific research are quite com-
petitive with ourselves. Besides, few Americans actually realize the size and scope of Russian espionage in this
country. They know a good deal more than we credit them with knowing, and no amount of security can combat
them entirely.
Yet, these very "secrets" which the Russians already know are kept from the American people who have a
definite right and "need-to-know." One of the prime examples of this brand of stupidity was the disclosure
earlier this year of tanks which employed carbon-arc lamps to blind enemy soldiers during night fighting. These
had been designed fifteen years earlier for use in World War II, but their existence was disclosed only recently.
This government brand of security has also hurt our own research and development. Many times have dif-
ferent manufacturers had design problems on classified contracts which were previously solved elsewhere in the
industry, but which had to be repeated because the one didn't know about the existence of the other. Much effort
and time might thus have been saved in the development of the ballistic missiles and earth satellite.
Psychology and public feeling are most effective weapons throughout such periods as the Cold War. It is
the duty of the government to tell the people when a spectacular event occurs. The mere disclosure of the event
wouldn't tell the Russians anything of importance or anything they didn't know previously; in fact, as things are
presently shaping up, the chances are the Russians have accomplished it previously. In addition, the spirit of the
American people means as much toward our strength as our whole stockpile of H-bombs.
Security measures are fine when used for the good of the country, but when they go so far as to jeopardize
that country, steps must he taken to amend them.

Melvin Janes, a friendly, sandy-haired man in
his early forties, may svell be the world's only
trackwalker with a doctor's degree.
Since 1953, Dr. Janes has trudged many a mile
along railroad tracks from Maine to Texas. His
mission: to check with his own eyes the killing
power of a unique railroad-bed weed destroyer.
Weeds are a menace to railroad men. They are
a fire hazard; wheels slip on them; they hold
moisture which rots the ties and undermines the
roadbed; they make maintenance difficult. More
than 50 kinds of weeds grow along the tracks.
Some die easily and stay dead—but many are
too tough for ordinary weed killers.
When Mobil scientists developed a promising
new oil-based killer—Agronyl R—Dr. Janes
took to the tracks to check it out. It killed the
weeds, all of them. Moreover, it's heavy and
doesn't blow on to adjacent farmland. It leaves
a film that discourages new growth (and also
helps keep the tracks from rusting).
Chemical research is only one of many profes-

go where
engineers don't get lost
171 tilP f*T*CilI)d One of the many hurdles that can slow
l/i v i/i \s \s down your progress as an engineer is
getting lost in the crowd. It can happen in
smaller companies as well as in big ones.
That's because size itself is not the villain.
The thing to watch out for is the kind
of company organization that swallows you
up and erases your individual identity.
Boeing is one company that takes steps to see
that engineers don't get lost in the shuffle.
Boeing engineers, for instance, work in small
integrated teams where initiative and ability
get plenty of visibility. Each engineer gets
a personal merit review every six months—
assuring you a continuing opportunity for
individual recognition. In addition,
Boeing engineers are eligible for
advancement at any time between reviews.
There are many other advantages to careers
at Boeing—including assignment to
exciting missile and jet-age projects, high
starting salaries, liberal retirement and
company-paid graduate study programs.
There are family advantages, too. One is a
choice of three sections of the country in
which to live. In each Boeing community
you'll find good housing and schools, a
youthful spirit, and abundant recreational
facilities for the whole family.
Boeing has openings for engineers, and for
physicists and mathematicians—openings
with a world of opportunity for advancement.
Now is the time to start planning ahead.

TECHNICAL MAGAZINE
Here is the product of an industry which has
seen a 400 percent growth in the last twenty
years.
Leonardo da Vinci, that great master
of the Renaissance, celebrated as a painter,
sculptor, architect, engineer, and scientist,
was also the first to employ the technical
report in his investigation. His notes show
that he used the written word not only
to record his work, but also to record his
progress in each project.
Today, there are over 2000 trade maga-
zines and journals, covering nearly every
topic of interest to the engineer, scientist,
or layman. Gross advertising revenues for
the entire industry in 1956 were near the
$800 million mark, four times what they
were 20 years ago. Additional evidence of
magazine vitality is circulation growth, up
25% from 1947 to 1955; in the same
period, the population only grew 16%.
The technical periodical came into ex-
istence because there was a demand for
specialized knowledge. If you operated a
textile mill, you were interested in finding
out whether some other textile operator
had solved a particular problem. You
were also interested in hearing quickly
about any new kind of machine or ac-
cessory that would make your production
faster, more economical, and more effi-
cient. The modern professional man has
at least one magazine which he considers
as "must" reading. He realizes only too
well that he is the loser if he fails to take
advantage of this source of information.
There are essentially two types of
technical or business magazines on the
market. The first covers a specific industry,
such as aviation, chemical, electrical, rail-
road, etc. The other is primarily interested
in a specific job function. These might be
research, design, production, control,
manufacturing, and maintenance.
For the reader these magazines must be
useful; else the subscription is cancelled.
However, we of the Technic staff were
out to discover what the professional
editors and publishers thought of their
own products. It was realized that the an-
swers to any queries would be biased, but
indeed, interesting.
A Form Letter Is Sent Out
Thus it was last spring, ninety-five form
letters were sent to a representative cross-
section of the industry. The following
questions were raised:
1) Just what is the purpose of your maga-
zine?
2) What topics or general areas do you
stress in your magazine?
3) For strictly what kind of people do
you write? e.g. engineers, scientists,
lay people, etc.
4) How great do you consider the need
for your magazine?

technical" magazines on the market
todays
6) Since there are several other magazines
published today which stress approxi-
mately the same points and fulfill the
same requirements as your's, why do
you feel you are so vital?
These were not meant to be "nasty" as
one editor seemed to think; rather, they
were purposely painted in order to draw
out some very pertinent information. Be-
fore discussing the answers, a few com-
ments regarding the letters received would
not be out of order. The fact that there
were only 41 letters returned was some-
what disappointing, but it must be re-
membered that summer is a bad time for
corresponding because of vacations. Both
American and British editors were con-
tacted, and in general, the replies were
most courteous and informative.
However, one editor returned the form
letter, and his reply consisted of one, two,
or three word answers, pencilled in the
margin next to each question. At the bot-
tom of the page, he rubber-stamped his
name, below which he printed the word
"editor" in crayon. It is difficult to be-
lieve that a professional man would be
so discourteous. What makes this letter
stand out particularly is the fact that an
editor of a competing magazine also
answered, but most politely, with two
pages of typewritten information.
Answers to the Letter
As widespread as was the cross-section
of magazines contacted, the purposes of
each of the publications were surprisingly
similar. Of prime importance, although
perhaps distasteful to some, is the need
to make money. This is true for any maga-
zine which is not a house organ or sub-
sidized by an industry or organization.
Some are the official publications of par-
ticular organizations or are the outline
for technical papers presented at meetings.
In addition to bringing the reader edi-
torial information, product information
in the advertising pages is provided. The
engineer can be aided in solving his prob-
lems, he can remain up-to-date in those
particular fields of interest to him, and he
is able to communicate with fellow sci-
entists and engineers by means of the
written word.
The topics or general areas stressed in
the magazines contacted cover just about
everything from air-conditioning to yacht-
ing. Included in the list were both "hori-
zontal" and "vertical" publications. Since
these terms may not be familiar to the
reader, a brief explanation might be
helpful. The term "horizontal" is used in
publications covering the same type of in-
formation in various fields. For example,
Electrical Engineering covers the six
fields entailed, namely, power, communi-
cation, science and electronics, instrumen-
tation, industry, and general applications.
A "vertical" publication is one which
covers only one type of industry. Ameri-
can Machinist, published for production
management in the metal-working indus-
tries, would be a typical example.
The third question was relevant only
when considering individual answers. It
depends upon the topic or general area
stressed in the magazine, and will vary
from the engineer to the scientist to the
layman in each case.
There was nary a question in the minds
of the editors when it came to the need
for their respective publications. Many
cited their present list of subscribers,
some their growing list, and still others
the tremendous amount of advertising
present between the covers of their maga-
zines. Another fairly reasonably accurate
gauge measuring a magazine's necessity,
which was brought to light was the
amount of reader's correspondence. One
editor mentioned that "without recourse
to some magazines such as ours that can
continually audit the many basic develop-
ments that are taking place and provide
him with information on the ones that
may be significant to him, our average
reader would have to spend more time in
research, and more money in travel than
he could possibly manage." As automa-
tion continues apace, it will be increasing-
ly difficult for the engieer and scientist
to keep up-to-date on his own; the tech-
nical magazine provides this information.
The answers to the fifth question were
numerous and complete. However, there
were four which were particularly perti-
nent, and which should be retained in
their original context for full value. Mr.
Ralph Smith, vice-president and editorial
director of the McGraw-Hill Publishing
Company, heard about our project from
one of his editors to whom the question-
naire was sent. He returned a most grac-
ious letter of which the following is
part;
"There are certainly too many technical
magazines on the market today; the num-
Mechanical Engineering is the course of study of Bert Hil-
burger, frequent contributor and Articles Editor of the Technic.
Bert is a graduate of Canisius High School, Buffalo, New York,
where he was photo editor of the yearbook and a member of
the Science Club and National Forensic Society. Last summer
he worked for Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory and spent free
time pursuing his flying, photographic and sailing hobbies.

to men on selected lists of occupational
title free of charge and, therefore, free of
responsibility to put reader-interest first.
If there are too many "too technical" pub-
lications on the market, that is a self-cor-
recting evil: the readers for whom they
are too technical leave them for less tech-
nical ones. (As an aside, it might be easy
to demonstrate that there's a shortage of
highly technical publication service to some
limited groups of specialists in highly
technical fields for the simple reason that
the number of potential readers is too
small to make the provision of magazines
to meet their esoteric needs commercially
practical.)"
R. W. Bolz, Editor of Automation, had
a few words to say which may well be per-
tinent to everyone reading this.
"There are too many "technical" maga-
zines, of course. But this must be qualified
—there are too many "junk" books—-
poorly edited—devoid of quality—de-
void of purpose or editorial aims and
ethics. There are altogether too few really
high quality technical journals. Too few
that really have a burning desire to put
into the hands of the right reader specific,
proven facts which will assist him. To be
able to do this job requires an editor
who is an engineer with wide experience
and knowledge of the field to the present
where he is capable of doing the job of
the reader himself. Few of today's editor-
ial staffs can lay claim to such talents or
ability and for this among other reasons
we feel our organization (Penton Pub-
lications) is vital and outstanding."
Of interest particularly to the senior
engineer or recent graduate are the com-
ments of Anderson Ashburn, Managing
Editor of American Machinist and a past
editor of the Technic:
"As to your fifth question as to whether
there are too many "too technical" maga-
zines, the easy answer would be to say
yes. Obviously all our competitors should
discontinue publication immediately. 1
have no doubt that the people who manu-
facture automobiles, cigarettes, tooth
paste, and missiles hold the same views
as to the number of people competing in
their areas. But to be more realistic about
it, most of the magazines that combine for
any length of time do so because they are
offering a valuable service for some group
of people.
"If there seem to be more magazines
today than ever before and they seem to
be more specialized than ever before it is
at least in part due to the increasing com-
plexity of industry and the previously
mentioned increase in the rate of accelera-
tion in development. People who com-
plain that there are too many magazines
sometimes are the people who could profit
more by a closer and more selective read-
ing of some of the ones available. It is
obviously foolish to attempt to read all of
the magazines published and probably
even foolish to attempt to read all of the
magazines that are published for their in-
dustry or profession. However, any techni-
cal man who expects to keep abreast of
the times not only should, but must, lay
out a reading schedule for himself so
that his education will not stop at the
field; hence their vitalness. J. B. Duncan,
Editor of The Automobile Engineer,
which is an English publication, came up
with a typically glib English statement:
"The first part of this question is not
too happily phrased. It suggests that you
look upon men like myself as what I
believe you in America refer to as egg-
heads', obsessed with a sense of their own
importance. This is far from the truth.
Personally, I should say to describe any
technical periodical as 'vital' is to debase
the English language. What I would
say is that The Automobile Engineer does
serve a useful purpose. Fortunately, I am
point he finished school. Unless he does
this, the day will come when he will find
to his embarrassment, that progress in his
industry has left him and his company far
behind."
Yet another angle is provided by
Steve Tieout of Engineering New Record:
"As in any other business, we believe
that the "consumer" determines the even-
tual success or failure of a project. Espec-
ially in the magazine field, no amount of
persuasion can make a man read a maga-
zine he doesn't like. Prom the advertiser's
point of view, a great number of maga-
zines does pose a problem. It is his diffi-
cult job to determine which magazines are
well read—and which are not—as well as
whether the type of people reading it are
a good audience for his advertising. As
media analysts become more and more
expert, magazines that are not doing a
good job editorially tend to fall by the
wayside. Result: the reader—and the ad-
vertiser—bene fit."
Referring to the last question, one edi-
tor remarked that it was "as easy to an-
swer as the famous one about whether you
have stopped beating your wife." The an-
swers to this one particularly were many
and varied. Some were extremely modest,
saying they did not feel so vital, but
pointed out that they were constantly re-
searching their impact on readers so as to
make sure they were serving them effec-
tively. Others maintained that they were
definitely the best in their field and cited
various readership surveys for proof. The
remainder said they were alone in the
not alone in thinking this, nor is the
thought confined to Great Britain, since
forty percent of our circulation goes
overseas!'
One of the most interesting points dis-
covered through the survey is that there
are business publications which do not re-
quire payment for their magazines. For
example, as an engineer, you might sud-
denly find yourself receiving a construc-
tion magazine through no effort or desire
of your own. The publisher might have
found your name on an association list, or
a distributor or salesman who calls on you
might have instructed the publisher to
send you the magazine with his compli-
ments. You may or may not like the maga-
zine particularly, but there it is in your
mailbox, and the publisher counts you
among his "readers"! Thus, the publisher
of a free magazine really only guarantees
that the magazine ends up on the reader's
desk, and not that it is ever opened.
The Future and You
For some time now, both the editorial
and advertising pages of the Technical
Periodical have been improving. The
readers are more educated than in the
past, and they comprise a more profes-
sional audience. In short, they are a more
sophisticated group than ever before and
must be dealt with on a higher intellec-
tual plane. This presents a challenge to
the editor and publisher of the Technical
publication that is being met with more
acceptable results as they become more
"circulation" conscious.

An engineering English profes-
sor here at Michigan presents
the department's views on the
East Hall courses required of
all engineering undergrads.
The English program in the College
of Engineering is best understood in
the light of current developments in the
Engineering profession.
One of our recent graduates told me
last spring, as we sat at lunch in his
plant, that he blessed his days at Michi-
gan because he had been grounded in
fundamentals rather than applications,
and that the superiority of this type of
education became apparent the moment he-
was thrust among men of superficial train-
ing.
Those who urge that engineering col-
leges devote themselves to specialized
training may be thinking of their own
interests while overlooking the needs of
the individual and the profession at large.
Although the line between fundamental
and applied science may often be obscure
in engineering, the engineer who pur-
sues his interests too narrowly may even-
tually be handicapped by this very spec-
ialization when he joins a profession that
daily grows more diverse and increasingly
demands flexibility of its personnel.
The Engineering College of the Uni-
versity of Michigan has consistently
sought to educate its men and women in
a broad program of fundamentals and to
avoid the hazzards of overspecialization.
In whatever post a graduating engineer
subsequently finds himself some adjust-
ment will be required; but that adjust-
ment will be simplified considerably if his
training has been broad rather than nar-
row, deep rather than shallow.
The Michigan tradition is effectively
symbolized in Dean Mortimer E. Cooley's
generous endowment of the annual con-
test that seeks to extend the undergrad-
uate engineer's understanding by direct-
ing his attention into fields beyond his
area of concentration. This view is also
apparent in the current practice of cut-
ting across departmental lines in the for-
mulation of meaningful engineering pro-
grams, especially in the recently developed
curriculum of Science Engineering.
One phase of this broadening and
deepening program is the work of the
English department, which has consis-
tently adhered to the philosophy that its
task is to educate the student primarily
as a literate, even a cultivated, human
being who is preparing for a career in
science and engineering. In the ten hours
of English taken by the majority of engi-
neering students—six hours from Group
I, two from Group II, and two from
Group III—the attention is directed to
three important areas: writing, reading,
and speaking. I shall discuss these in
order.
The notable interest in technical writ-
ing that has emerged in the past few years
did not originate in the schools and col-
leges but sprang from business, industry,
and the professions. Such large organiza-
tions as The Association of Technical
Writers and Editors, now international,
and The American Medical Writers Asso-
ciation, with their full and busy programs,
are evidence of what is occurring. In
response to the unprecedented demand
for technical writers—Sperry Gyroscope
alone employs over three hundred tech-
nical writers, all of whom are engineers
or scientists—Rensselaer Polytechnic In-
stitute has introduced a program in tech-
nical writing leading to a Master's degree,
and several schools, including RPI, MIT,
and Pennsylvania, now conduct technical
writing institutes.
Unfortunately, such activity creates the
impression that technical and scientific
writing is unique, and unlike the writing
ordinarily taught in schools and colleges.
The view is evident in expressions like
Business English and Engineering Eng-
lish. Such terms are unfortunate because
they are inaccurate. One might as well
speak of Dental English or School of Nat-
ural Recources English.
Anyone acquainted with technical writ-
ing and with the programs of conventions
and institutes devoted to the subject
knows that the emphasis there always
rests on the qualities sought in any good
freshman English course: clarity, effi-
ciency, precision, and logic.
This is not to say that all writing is of
a single type. Reginald O. Kapp, in his
splendid little volume The Presentation of
Technical Information, draws a useful
distinction between imaginative and junc-
tional writing. The first is the language of
the novelist, the poet, the dramatist, and

sity; and Ph.D., University of Michigan. Besides being actively

and The Augustan Repring Society.
its purpose is to control the reader's emo-
tions. The second is the language in
which the affairs of men are conducted.
It is the language of science, commerce,
government, education—in fact, most
writing belongs in this category. Its pur-
pose is to control the reader's mind.
Technical writing is unique more by
reason of its subject matter than its style.
It does avoid, of course, the illustrations
and implications regularly employed by
its more powerful counterpart, imagina-
tive writing. Functional writing produces
great reporting, imaginative writing great
literature.
The English department is sometimes
asked why more of its program is not
devoted to report writing and to technical
literature. The Department certainly rec-
ognizes the significance and importance of
the technical report in all aspects of mod-
ern science. And the report certainly is
not ignored in the Department. We sim-
ply believe that the engineer's writing
should not be confined to any one form.
If a graduating engineer could be sure
that he would never be called upon to
write anything but reports, there would be
some grounds for focusing the writing on
this form. But the kinds of positions that
Michigan engineers will occupy require a
diversity of communication skills. A
young engineer in the industrial course I
taught last spring had been with his com-
pany less than a year, yet within a period
of three short weeks he had had to cope
with the following writing assignments:
a technical report on a laboratory investi-
gation he had conducted; countless letters
to customers, many of whom were neither
scientists nor engineers, regarding market
ing and manufacturing problems; and a
company approver paper which he had to
read before the New York meeting of a
management society.
This engineer had to shift readily from
one style to another, from detached, ob-
jective reporting to a personal manner
that would instill confidence in a disturb-
ed customer or impress a high level man-
agement group. To meet these demands
required much more than skill in techni-
cal writing. And the higher an engineer
rises in his profession the more varied
become these demands upon his ability to
communicate.
Accordingly, the English department,
taking its cue from other programs in the
College, has followed the policy of em-
phasizing the general rather than the par-
ticular, of stressing the fundamentals of
clear, efficient exposition which can be ap-
plied to the variety of writing require-
ments the engineer will face. Writing
about technical matters is rarely easy, but
the task should be more readily accom-
plished if the writer has been grounded in
the nature of language, the mechanics of
expression, and the elements of structure
and logic.
It should be noted, nevertheless, that
although most of the writing in Group I
courses is general theme writing, the pro-
gram does include the study of the techni-
cal report, in addition to a limited amount
of work in letter writing. Group II in-
cludes a course in the technical and scien-
tific article, and Group III offers the
course in report writing. Actually, there-
fore, a student could concentrate in com-
position, both general and specialized, if
he followed English 11 and 12 with 35
and 136.
The other half of the question leads us
into the second area of the English pro-
gram, which is reading. What should an
undergraduate engineer read and why?
Every English course has a subject and
a technique, but sometimes the two are
not properly differentiated in the mind of
an observer. The subject matter of Eng-
lish 56, for example, is the short story,
but the technique is devoted to teaching
the student not how to write short staries,
but how to read them with understanding
and appreciation. The short story form is
in some respects, incidental; it just hap-
pens to be the mold in which the writer
chose to cast his ideas.
The substance of a course should have
the qualities of both a teething ring and
food. As a teething ring it must be tough
enough to exercise the bite; as food it
must be substantial and nourishing to
promote growth. The subject matter of
the English course is of both varieties: it
exercises the student's mind and sensibili-
ties at the same time that it provides the
substance for emotional and intellectual
development. In the essays in Group I
courses, the freshman engineer wrestles
with the exposition and analysis of count-
less modern problems that complicate
our lives. In the courses in imaginative lit-
erature, he encounters the artist's sensitive
interpretation of life. He becomes aware
of what imaginative writing can do that
is denied to functional writing. He de-
velops the power to delight in reading, in
the grace and beauty of fine literature. He
encounters great and significant ideas,
and, most important of all, perhaps, en-

Interlingua makes use of the
word roots common to most
languages and provides the
scientist and engineer with a
means of international com-
munication.
The Interlingua Division of Science
Service was established in 1953, with
separate offices in New York City, for the
express purpose of promoting the utiliza-
tion of Interlingua in the fields of science
and technology in the broadest sense.
The system of international communi-
cation known as Interlingua was worked
out in the linguistic research laboratories
of the International Auxiliary Language
Association, also of New York City,
which discontinued its activities after the
publication of the basic lexical and gram-
matical manuals of the new language.
The International Auxiliary Language
Association (IALA) had been organized
in 1924 to act as a mediator among the
numerous factions within the world-
language movement and to explore the
possibility of concerted action on the part
of all concerned in favor of a universally
acceptable compromise solution. In its
later years the Association evolved a new
approach which constituted in fact a com-
plete break with the interlinguistic past.
The idea of a constructed universal lan-
guage was rejected as impractical. The
ideal of universal instruction in a common
world system of communication—with its
implication that the study of additional
foreign languages be left to the congenital
antiquarian or hobbyist— was recognized
as inimical. In positive terms it was stipu-
lated that a system of universal communi-
cation should be evolved from the ele-
ments shared by the major languages of
the Occident, in such a way that a mes-
sage presented in it would be compre-
hensible on the basis of the reader's or
listener's knowledge of anyone of the
participating languages. The occidental
languages were chosen as the basis of de-
parture because as a group they have ac-
quired world-wide importance through
the fact that scientific and technical ter-
minologies, which are largely rooted in
their shared elements, have transferred
many of their basic structural features to
all the internationally significant lan-
guages of all the internationally active
peoples of the world.
It has been estimated that a technical
text submitted in an English version to
every worker in a particular field—any-
where in the world and regardless of the
individual's linguistic background or
training—would be understood by about
55 per cent of its recipients. The corre-
sponding percentage of comprehension
for a German text would be below 25, for
a French or Spanish version somewhere
around 20, for a Russian version below
3, and for a Japanese version below 1. I
Considering (1) that there are jew sci-
entists who have not had some direct or
indirect contact with either Latin or
French or Spanish or English or one of
the other major occidental languages and
(2) that no one able to read one of the
languages listed jails to find numerous
jamiliar elements in each of the others, it
stands to reason that a "prototype" lan-
guage—embodying all the shared charac-
teristics of the occidental languages but
none of their individual idiosyncrasies—
would assure virtually 100 per cent com-
prehension among technically qualified
readers of a particular type of subject mat-
ter discussed in it.
This, in a nutshell, is the theory of
Interlingua. Its soundness has been dem-
onstrated by four years of extensive and
successful practice.*
The idea, then, is not to offer the world
a "convenient" or "easy" or "simple"' or
"logical" additional language for inter-
national purposes, but rather to provide
for the possibility of writing and speaking
in a linguistic system which expert A can
"read" or "listen to" in French while
simultaneously expert B "reads it" or "lis-
tens to it" in Spanish or in Italian or in

Latin or also in English or in German;
and all this not on the basis of special
studies but simply owing to the modicum
of linguistic alertness which our civiliza-
tion expects every educated person to pos-
sess.
By way of illustration let us suppose
the world's cardiologists are to be inform-
ed that "in patients with accelerated atrio-
ventricular conduction, there is a special
tendency to develop paroxysmal atrial
tachycardia and atrial fibrillation." This
statement as such, according to the above-
quoted estimate, would be understood by
55 per cent of the world's cardiologists.
In Interlingua, the same statement
reads: "In patientes con accelerate conduc-
tion atrio-ventricular, il ha un tendentia
special al disveloppamento de paroxysmal
tachycardia atrial e de fibrillation atrial."
Of this form of the statement virtually
universal comprehension is claimed be-
cause it can be "read" or "listened to" in
a variety of languages.
If a reader's most familiar language is
German and he happens to have had a
standard German medical training, he can
read our Interlingua passage as follows:
"In Patienten mit akzelerierter atrio-ven-
trikularer Konduktion besteht eine spe-
zielle Tendenz zur Entwicklung paroxys-
maler atrialer Tachykardie und atrialer
Fibrillation." (The point is of course not
that a self-respecting German stylist
would publish the statement in this form
but rather that every German cardiologist
can understand it.)
If read by a Frenchman or someone
otherwise at home in French, the state-
ment comes out like this: "En patients
avec une conduction atrio-ventriculaire
acceleree, il y une tendance speciale au
developpement de tachycardie atriale
paroxysmale e de fibrillation atriale."
Some readers of this article may wish
to continue the demonstration by reread-
ing the Interlingua passage in Spanish or
Italian or Latin or even in Russian. The
result will be equally striking in all cases.
At first glance one may wish to object
to the implied conclusion that Interlingua
is distinguished by its almost universal ac-
cessibility, insisting that the above pas-
sages in German and French are no less
universally accessible than the passage in
Interlingua. But on second thought it will
be apparent that the objection is valid
only because our French and German texts
are "very bad" French and German: Fol-
lowing Interlingua as they do in almost
slavish literalness, they contain little or
nothing that is peculiarly French or Ger-
man. Furthermore, the English text
chosen for this presentation is likewise
exceptionally simple and devoid of Eng-
lish idiosyncrasies, the reason being that it
too is actually not an original but a trans-
lation from Interlingua.
Two Other Communication Techniques
As a contemporary technique of inter-
national communication, Interlingua is of
coequal interest with the practice of
Simultaneous Translation (or ST) and
the theory of Machine Translation (com-
monly known as MT).
This triad of modern developments—
MT, ST, and Interlingua—needs to be
evaluated against the general background
of twentieth-century communications re-
quirements which are unique in more
senses than one. To be sure, men have al-
ways endeavored to communicate with one
another and as a matter of fact, homo
communicans would be a more realistic
description of our species than homo sa-
piens. But it is only in the present age
that communication has come to be an
essential and integral part of virtually all
productive and creative processes. It is
easier to imagine that a battleship be con-
structed without steel than without paper
and ink. This colossal fact—colossal in its

is not generally appreciated.
The field of communications problems,
as we must conceive of it today, is indeed
vast in both theory and practice. It ex-
tends from the lowly trivialities of the
grammars of individual languages to so-
ciological and cultural psychology, takes
in semantics and general semantics, and
covers a variety of areas that are only in-
directly verbal or clearly not verbal at all.
The three contemporary communica-
tions techniques referred to above have in
common that they endeavor to function
exclusively in the subarea of problems re-
sulting from the miraculous fact that men
speak in many tongues. This restrictive
definition will impress many as obvious,
but it needs to be emphasized for the
benefit of those who still hold naively
that once the language barrier separating
a Russian from an American or a French-
man from an Arab has been overcome,
smooth communication is assured. Of
course, nothing could be farther from the
truth, and neither ST nor MT nor Inter-
lingua can in any way contribute to a so-
lution of the host of problems that ham-
per interhuman communication aside from
mankind's polyglot blessing of Babel.
Though ST, MT, and Interlingua are
concerned with the same set of problems,
they yet do not compete with one another.
As for MT, it must be noted that its
tangible performances at this time are nil.
There is as yet no telling what part of its
theoretical promise, if any, will be ful-
filled. But if it does come to full fruition,
it will serve to make a written or printed
communication accessible to readers of
languages other than the one used by the
original author. It will never be concerned
with oral communication, which is the
special domain of ST.
The practical usefulness of this latter
technique—i.e. ST in contrast to MT—is
fully established. It serves efficiently to
make oral communication in one language
accessible to speakers (or, more precisely,
"understanders") of another. It cannot
and does not try to produce publishable
texts and will never be concerned with
printed or written communication.
Interlingua—in contrast to both MT
and ST—does not manipulate languages
but is one. It is a full-fledged language,
understood by all but native to none. This
implies that as ST can manipulate spoken
Russian and French and German and
English and as MT may some day become
able to manipulate printed Russian and
French and German and English, etc., so
they can or may become able to manipu-
late Interlingua.
So far no attempts have been made in
practice to translate oral communication
simultaneously into Interlingua; but this
is an area in which direct collaboration
between ST and Interlingua is both pos-
sible and highly desirable. As ST is now
being practiced, it can make a presenta-
tion in language X accessible to speakers
of two, three, four, five other languages.
Every additional language adds consider-
ably to the cumbersomeness of its appara-
tus and makes its cost more forbidding.
Complete coverage is only theoretically
possible, for in practice no one would
seriously think of providing the partici-
pants in an international gathering with
20 simultaneous translations, just because
speakers of 20 different languages have
been invited. With simultaneous transla-
tion into Interlingua, virtually complete
coverage would immediately be estab-
lished.
Parallely, there is the future possibility
of manipulating Interlingua along with
other languages by the technique of MT.
But in this area we have the considerably
more interesting prospect of Interlingua's
entering actually into the theoretical and
practical preparatory work that still sep-
arates us from getting machines to pro-
duce usable translations. The crux of MS
would seem to be that there is no one-to-
one correspondence between any two lan-
guages in the units of meaning which they
represent by signs a machine can be taught
to recognize. To make matters worse, ths
kind of difference also involves numerous
cases where one language represents by a
concrete and (to it) essential sign what
another language never thinks of as
worthy of expression. You cannot, by-
machine or otherwise, translate "uncle"
into Norwegian unless you know whether
the man is the brother of a father or of a
mother. And this sort of information the
human mind can derive from contextual
and other sources which are inaccessible to
the machine.)
Since Interlingua is a common language
—with many idiosyncrasies, to be sure,
but none not shared by many tongues—
mechanical translation from and into
Interlingua is not only less formidable an
assignment than for instance mechanical
translation from English into Russian and
back, it also promises to help clarify the
nature of the problems of calibrating one
language in terms of another.
It has been suggested, and must be re-
jected most emphatically, that world-wide
acceptance of Interlingua among people

PUBLICATIONS
ENGINEERING
AS A CAREER
This article presents a basic in-
troduction to a career in a relative-
ly new profession—Publications En-
gineering. From the viewpoint of
the engineering college student, a
description is given of the opportu-
nities available in this field, the size
and types of companies and organ-
izations that employ Publications
Engineers, the typical duties and re-
sponsibilities, compensation com-
pared with other branches of engi-
neering, qualifications and apti-
tudes required, and the prepara-
tion necessary in terms of college
courses and activities.
Those who are contemplating
entering this profession may find
some answers to their questions.
Those who are only vaguely aware
of its existence may discover an
outlet for their training and particu-
lar abilities that they had not prev-
iously considered.
The new profession of Technical Writ-
ing has become big business in the United
States and Canada. Up to five percent of
the cost of a typical product or product
development may go into the writing of
progress reports, technical instruction
manuals, parts catalogs, and the like. The
U. S. government alone spends over one
quarter billion dollars a year for the prep-
aration of technical publications, and an-
other seven million for printing them.
Stacked up they would make a pile reach-
ing seventy miles into the sky.
Although an actual manpower inventory
has not been made, most unofficial esti-
mates indicate that fifteen to twenty
thousand men and women are currently
engaged as technical writers and editors.
Of these about twenty-five percent would
have the fundamental science education to
qualify as Publications Engineers.1
It would be unthinkable in our highly
technological industrial organization to go
without the specialized Publications Engi-
neer. The more complex the equipment,
the more the need. It has been stated by
a Department of Defense official that
"maintenance of material is more de-
pendent upon good technical writing than
is any other field of endeavor." 2 In engi-
neering reports the Publications Engineer
can use his highly developed skills to as-
sist and relieve the engineer and free him
for other work, thereby upping industry's
productive capacity.
Naturally, only the highlights or im-
portant considerations of a subject as
broad as the selection of a career can be
covered in this short article. Presented for
your consideration are some data which it
is hoped you will find useful in determin-
ing whether or not a technical writing
career is for you. The Sperry Gyroscope
Company, with which this writer is most
familiar, and which has had for many
years an extensive and comprehensive
publications department, will be used as
an example.
Who Are the Employers of Publications
Engineers?
The majority of employers of Publica-
tions Engineers can be basically divided
into five main categories: Industrial Or-
ganizations including engineering and
research laboratories, Technical Writing
firms (so-called subcontractors), Govern-
mental Agencies, Educational Institutions,
and the Professional and Trade Press.
Space permits only the mention of two
other categories, equally worthwhile but
numerically small, namely, Free-lance
work and Technical Advertising Agencies.
The latter is indeed a very promising
1 The term Technical Writer and Publica-
tions Engineer are often used interchangeably.
The author uses the connotation that the Pub-
lications Engineer is essentially an engineer
who has the liking and the ability, or can ac-
quire the ability, to write well, whereas a
Technical Writer does not necessarily have to
be an engineer.

Engineering Department of Defense. His paper
"The Importance of Technical Writing to the
Maintenance of Materiel" was presented at the
1955 Convention of the Society of Technical
Writers.

(Publications Departments normally do
not handle advertising or publicity.)
The type of work, products, and/or
projects rather than the size of an in-
dustrial organization determine whether
or not Publications Engineers will be re-
quired. A large company making simple
mechanical or electrical devices may have
little or no use for a Publications Engi-
neer, while a smaller outfit engaged in
manufacturing a variety of highly complex
electromechanical devices, even though
production quantities are small, may re-
quire a relatively high percentage of such
individuals. Similarly, a laboratory en-
gaged in a large number of engineering
research projects would tend to employ
more Publications Engineers than one
covering a more limited field. A firm such
as Sperry which has a great diversity of
products and projects employs nearly a
hundred Publications Engineers in its sev-
eral divisions.
Some companies, and these include
some of large size, do not have sufficient
steady work to maintain a staff of Publi-
cations Engineers or a separate Publica-
tions Department, or they may find it
cheaper or for other reasons desirable not
to do so. Instead they employ the services
of technical writing subcontractors who
are invited in to do the work. Such firms
normally do technical publications work
for many different companies, much of it
simultaneously.
The Federal Government, because of
the nature of its many diverse activities,
employs a representative number of Publi-
cations Engineers, although usually in
smaller groups in widely separated divi-
sions. The Department of Defense has
probably the largest individual group in
the government.
Educational institutions employ Publi-
cations Engineers as instructors and in
connection with research activities in
which they may be engaged.
Professional and trade magazines, of
which there are a large number, employ
Publications Engineers on their writing
staffs. They can be thought of as a seg-
ment of the particular industry with which
each is usually associated.
What Industries Employ Publications
Engineers?
It would be safe to say that most in-
dustries employ such individuals. The air-
craft industry, including avionics, is re-
puted to employ about three thousand.
Chemical, medical, and pharmaceutical
companies are large employers, as are the
electrical and electronic industries. Agri-
cultural, mining, automotive, business
machines, metals, and petroleum indus-
tries are all well represented.
What Has Been the Need—What Will
It Be in the Future?
Very much like development and pro-
duction engineering, the need for Publi-
cations Engineers has almost continuously
exceeded the available supply over the
past fifteen years. Many firms have experi-
enced great difficulty in finding sufficient
writers—with or without experience—to
keep up with the seemingly inexhaustible
demand for technical publications. The
ratio of Publications Engineers to engi-
neers should be in the area of one to
twenty; however, the short supply of pub-
lications Engineers has often forced this
ratio to be higher, sometimes double. The
available supply of personnel is not only
always employed but also the really quali-
fied and trained individuals are spread
thin and interspersed with those who are
not yet as qualified. Many who started
only a few years ago are now engaged in
supervisory positions. This shortage has
been caused to some extent by a general
lack of knowledge of the existence of this
field and profession (this was quite preva-
lent a few years ago), the fact that col-
lege students were not preparing for
work in technical writing (courses were

Professor DAVID V. RAGONE
The faculty of the Engineering college has had an out-
standing young member in its ranks since 1953 in the per-
son of David V. Ragone. Last June the Engineering Society
of Detroit recognized publicly the caliber of his work by
awarding him its annual award of achievement as an Out-
standing Young Engineer.
Doctor Ragone received his training at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, his S.B. in 1951, his S.M. in
1952, and his ScD. in 1953. He received his appoint-
ment at Michigan that year. During his four years teaching
at the University of Michigan, Dr. Ragone has made an
outstanding record as an inspiring teacher. He is the kind
of teacher who makes the course interesting, and he empha-
sizes the important principles which he expects the stu-
dents to retain. He has developed a graduate course and
thermodynamics for metallurgical engineers. In addition to
his teaching a variety of courses at the University he has
conducted an extension course in thermodynamics at Mid-
land, Michigan. He has taken the lead in developing a
thermodynamics course in the new Science Engineering Cur-
riculum and taught it the first time it was given last year.
But Dr. Ragone's contributions do not all lie in curricu-
lum improvements. He has made significant contributions in
his research to the fluidity of metals and currently is de-
veloping a program of application of thermodynamic prin-
ciples to molten metal systems. Along with co-authors he
has nine publications to his credit. His work is responsible
for the design of the Ragone Fluidity Tester. The device
is used by foundry men to measure the quality of the mol-
ten metal prior to pouring it into molds.
He has assumed several administrative responsibilities in
the University such as supervision of the Sohma Precision
Laboratory and the Mass Spectrographic Laboratory. He
served as chairman of the qualifying examination commit-
tee for the doctorate and currently is a member of the
graduate committee.
Dr. Ragone is also active in the following national so-
cieties: American Foundrymen Society, American Society
for Metals, American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical
Engineers, American Society of Engineering Education,
British Institute of Metals, Tau Beta Pi, Kappa Kappa
Sigma, Sigma Zi, and Vulcans. Several of his technical
papers have been presented before meetings of these na-
tional societies.
In addition to his many professional interests, Professor
Ragone is a friend to many of the students on the cam-
pus. He is chapter advisor to Theta Xi, his social fraternity.
He was elected as a faculty member of the Vulcans, the
engineering honorary society, and has spoken to the Evans
Scholars on "Adjustment to College." He is truly a
friend and counselor of the young men of this campus.

Facts on food colors
What about those headlines on
food colors? And the stories that
some certified food colors are
toxic? Is there anything to the
Food and Drug Administration's
recent delisting of three previous-
ly acceptable colors?
Here are a few facts behind the
headlines.
The practice of coloring food is
centuries old. Though the early
colors were of natural origin, they
have been replaced in the coloring
of many foods by superior syn-
thetic colors — the certified "coal-
tar" colors. The Food and Drug
Administration has been certify-
ing a number of these colors for
use in food since the early 1900's.
You're probably aware of some
of the foods commonly colored to-
day: ice cream, soft drinks, baked
goods, candies, processed cheese,
gelatin desserts, orange skins,
margarine, butter.
Why then have some food
colors been "delisted" and why
are others being considered for
delisting?
The controversy centers on the
meaning of a single word in the
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act: "harmless."
The Food and Drug Adminis-
tration's definition: incapable of
producing harm in any quantity
or under any circumstances.
The food color industry's: in-
capable of producing harm under
normal conditions of use.
It is the industry's view that
FDA animal tests of certified
colors have made use of quantities
of color unrelated to — and far in
excess of — quantities normally
ingested by humans. A newspaper
interview quoted the Commission-
er of Food and Drugs as saying
that he "conceded that three coal-
tar dyes recently banned were
harmless as used, but explained
that their use was [a] technical
violation of the law as now
worded."
The absolute FDA standard
seems to find support in the popu-
lar tendency to regard synthetics
as inherently inferior to natural
products. Yet, many fresh vege-
tables we eat every day contain
small but tolerable quantities of
naturally occurring poisons which,
if judged as food colors are now
being judged, would lead to the
elimination of a large part of our
vegetable diet.
What the food color industry
asks is an amendment to the
present law which would clearly
grant power to the FDA to set
quantitative limits on the use of
colors in food. Such limits would
safeguard public health, permit
maintenance of our food color
supply, and encourage research in
the field.
Two articles — one supporting
the industry's position, the other
detailing manufacture and quality
control of food colors — have
been prepared by Allied's National
Aniline Division, the leading food
color producer. You can get them

Aerosol mold release
Remember the line that went, we
could have some ham and eggs if
we had some ham . . . and some
eggs. Stretch your imagination a
good deal, and it has some rele-
vance in the business of molding.
Low-molecular weight polyethy-
lene is a superior mold release.
There's hardly a more conven-
ient way to dispense liquids than
with an aerosol spray.

spray's push, by the way, is from
Allied's Genetron propellants.
Here's how it works. When hot
or cold mold cavities or other ob-
jects are sprayed, a smooth, rela-
tively hard film forms quickly on
the surface. This film provides
efficient release with a minimum
number of spray applications, re-
sulting in faster cycle time, reduc-
tion of rejects and consequent
lowering of production costs.
Poly-Lease 77 will be of interest
to molders of rubber, plastics (ep«
oxies, polyesters, phenolics, alkyd,.
urea, melamine), powdered metal.

letins has been published, appro-
priately enough, by the leading

Smoke Rings vs. Noise
Engineers at Douglas Aircraft company
are "blowing smoke rings" to help them
find the most effective means of suppress-
ing the noise of jet engines.
The rings, or "smoke slices," permit
them to see the phenomenon which makes
a jet engine roar—the severe turbulence
created by the jet exhaust shearing
through relatively still air.
With this visual reference, development
engineers of the Douglas Santa Monica
Division are better able to correlate the
geometric properties, or size and shape,
of the exhaust with the sound produced.
They diminish the sound by changing
the form of the jet exhaust in order to
reduce the noise-producing turbulence.
The jet blast is made visible by in-
jecting mineral oil into the air supply up-
stream from the jet exit. A thin slice of
light is then passed through the smoke
at any desired point downstream to show
just what form the exhaust has taken
when emitted through devices of various
shapes.
Resulting patterns arc photographed
for later reference.
The ingenious technique is also useful
in determining jet boundaries and spread-
ing rates for studies not related to noise
suppression.
Crystal Filter Revolutionizes
Communications Field
Dependable worldwide communications
are now well on the way with the advent
of a new type of radio and radar com-
ponent. The device, called a high fre-
quency crystal filter, makes it possible for
more radio stations to transmit without
overlapping and interfering with each
other. At the same time, the new device
greatly simplifies electronic equipment.
High frequency crystal filters are to exist-
ing conventional filters what transistors
are to vacuum tubes.
With more and more radio communi-
cation messages crowding the airwaves,
allotment of frequency bands to various
radio and radar needs has become an ever-
increasing problem. Up to now, filters
have presented serious bottlenecks to de-
signers of high frequency radio systems.
The higher one goes in frequency, the
harder it becomes to design a workable
filter.
However, mass-produced high fre-
quency crystal filters represent a major
breakthrough in the communications art.
Now that crystal filters are commercially
available, military and industrial designers
have already started to work on new de-
signs which will provide significantly bet-
ter communications and navigation equip-
ment.
Alignment Not Necessary
One of the biggest headaches with
radio receivers in the past has been the
constant servicing necessary—particularly
tuning and aligning. With crystal filters,
a radio receiver does not normally have
to be aligned once it is manufactured. The
quartz crystals, each about one-half the
size of a small silver coin, are extremely
stable under severe environmental condi-
tions. Abrupt temperature changes and
repeated heavy shock and vibration do
not adversely affect the crystal filters.
Simpler radio and radar receivers will
result from the inclusion of crystal filters.
A technique known as multiple conver-
sion has been used for years to get around
certain filtering problems. Using a crystal
filter in the circuit, multiple conversion
becomes unnecessary. The result is a radio
or radar receiver with fewer parts. The
higher the frequency of the receiver, the
more applicable this simplification be-
comes. And higher frequencies are the
trend.
Many Varied Applications
Primary applications of the highly re-
liable crystal filters will be in the field of
mobile communication equipment such as
military vehicular radios, walkie-Talkie,
taxicab and industrial radios; military
communications and navigation equip-
ment in ships and airplanes; interconti-
nental radio systems, such as over-the-
horizon scattered links; telephone systems;
radar systems; and missile systems. Many
other varied applications for crystal filters
and associated devices are also foreseen,
including a tiny button microphone which
can be worn on the lapel and which will
transmit messages or speeches several
hundred yards without any connecting
power sources. These same quartz crystal
devices will make it easier to generate
frequency-modulated signals for noise-
free communication (better FM stations).
Sources of other uses are forecast by
electronic specialists who hail the new
low-cost filters as one of the more im-
portant technological advances of this
decade.

IN THE

are you going to
get somewhere?
Perhaps you have heard some classmate say, almost complacently,
"Times have changed."
With many branches of industry today openly competing for good
science and engineering graduates, who can blame the young graduate-to-be
for feeling supremely confident. You know you can get a job,
know that salaries are high and are fully aware that
men with technical backgrounds are moving up to administrative
positions in ever-increasing numbers.
Nevertheless, in many respects, times have not changed at all.
That "first job" is every bit as important today as it was five, ten, twenty
years ago. Starting salaries remain only one of many factors to be
considered. And a man's future is still necessarily linked to the future
of the company for which he works. Moreover, a thoughtful examination
of such matters as potential growth, challenge, advancement policy,
facilities, degree of self-direction, permanence, benefits and the like often
indicates that real opportunity still does not grow on trees.

Her nearest kinsman—a nephew—
ordered her body to be shipped back to

To his horror, when the casket arrived,

At once he telegraphed the general's

The answer was:
"Uncertainties of reactive processes
make the use of hydrochloric acid unde-
sirable where alkilinity is involved."
The inquirer wrote back, thanking the
bureau for the advice, saying that he
would use the acid. The bureau wired
him: Regrettable decision involves un-
certainties. Hydrochloric acid will pro-
duce submuriate invalidating reactions."
Again the man wrote back thanking
them for their advice, saying that he was
glad to know that hydrochloric acid
would be alright. This time the bureau
wired in plain English:
"Hydrochloric acid will eat hell out of
your tube."

The following is an interview which
will never take place.
Reporter: "Well, Mr. Alum, I guess
things sure have changed around here
since your time."
Alum: "No, not particularly."
Rep.: "It was pretty rough sledding
back then, wasn't it?"
Alum: "No, we had it easy."
Rep.: "How about the parties? You
had some pretty wild parties back in the
20's didn't you?"
Alum: "Well, no. In fact, the best
party I ever went to was last night and
I got sick."
Rep.: "The weather was awfully bad
back then, wasn't it? How about the big
snow of 1926?"
Alum: "I don't remember any big
snow of 1926. First snow I ever saw was
when I was in Alaska during the war."
Rep: "Well, to sum things up, the
good old days certainly were the best,
don't you think?"
Alum: "Are you serious?"

Stopping at the first farmhouse on his
famous midnight ride, Paul Rivere cried,
"Is your husband at home?"
"Yes, came back the reply."
"Tell him to get up and defend him-
self; the British are coming."
At the second and third houses the
same conversation was repeated, but at
the fourth house it went something like
this:
"Is your husband at home?"
"No," came back the reply.
"Whoa!"

One day during a war, a tall, strong
and handsome Roman soldier broke into
a house where he found two luscious
maidens and their matronly nurse.
Chuckling with glee, he roared, "Pre-
pare thy selves for a conquest, my pret-
ties."
The lovely girls fell on their knees
and pleaded with him, "Do with us as
thou wilt, O Roman, but spare our
faithful old nurse."
Shut thy mouth," snapped the nurse.
"War is war."

RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING ARE
IMPORTANT AT HONEYWELL!
One indication of how impor-
tant research, design-develop-
ment and product engineering
are to Honeywell's continued
growth is the fact that over
half of Honeywell's more than
12,000 products were not made
by the company 5 years ago.
Some of the problems which Honeywell research
and engineering have solved recently are: the de-
velopment of variable inlet-air diffuser systems
for jet engines, which adjust to the speed of the
aircraft, allow such advanced planes as Convair's
B-58 to reach design speed; the production of the
space reference system for the Earth Satellite
Rocket; and the production of the Supervisory
DataCenter* central control panel which enables
one man in one location to read and control tem-
peratures for even the largest building.
Major research programs now underway at
Honeywell include: the development of new tech-
niques and the discovery of new materials to
overcome the problems of extremely high tem-
peratures created by high-speed aircraft and guided
missiles; the development of automatic control
systems for industrial automation; the develop-
ment of even more accurate navigation systems
for aircraft and rockets which may be called upon
for intercontinental and interplanetary travel.
HONEYWELL MEN ADVANCE RAPIDLY!
Naturally, in a company committed
to growth, opportunities are numer-
ous for the engineers and scientists
who can contribute to that growth.
And at Honeywell, other factors
accelerate advancement.
Engineers predominate among our
vice presidents, divisional executives
and department managers. Attitudes and opinions
of our scientists and engineers are understood
and supported by management.
Honeywell is composed of small units working
as a team. These units multiply opportunities for
early managerial experience and lay the founda-
tion for more important managerial assignments
in future years.
HONEYWELL OFFERS MANY
EXTRA BENEFITS!
Honeywell's extra benefit program is one of the
most liberal in industry. There's free group life
insurance . . . free accident and sickness insur-
ance . . . free hospital insurance. You'll find a
generous policy on paid vacations and holidays
and a modern retirement program paying life-
time benefits.
Whichever Honeywell division or location you
choose, you'll be assured of special training to
help you advance in your career. This training
includes regular on-the-job instruction, formal
classes at the company and tuition-aid courses at
nearby institutions. (Trademark

NOVEMBER, 1957


Studies in the psychology of occupa-
tions have taken psychologists through
the maze of psychological differences like
intelligence, special abilities, personality,
interests, etc. This list can be carried on
and on, yet all factors of study in in-
dividual differences revert back to person-
ality structure and development. Intel-
ligence is no longer considered completely
independent of other aspects of the per-
sonality. This is true too, of course, of
special abilities and interests. Because this
idea of personality structure as a motiva-
tional factor has become so prominent,
studies have been made and tests have
been given in the past in an attempt at
getting at certain points in the personality
structure which might show individual
differences as far as occupational choice is
concerned.
The main fault to be found in most ap-
proaches of seeking for personality factors
of importance has been the neglect of the
so called unconscious motivational level
and the over all early development of the
personality structure. Projective tests, their
job being to tap underlying aspects of
personality (the unconscious), such as the
Rorschach Test (the ink-blot test), the
Thematic Apperception Test, and the
Blacky Test are pertinent in the analysis
of unconscious motivation and personality
development. These tests have only re-
cently been used in occupational studies.
The Rorschach and the Thematic Apper-
ception Test (T.A.T.) were used by Roe,
a clinical psychologist famous for her oc-
cupational studies comparing artists and
scientists (painters and vertebrate Paleon-
tologists). A significant factor revealed in
the Rorschach testing was that the artists
tended to place the parts of the ink blot
into a whole and thus generalize more
often than the scientists. While the sci-
entists tended to pick out one part of the
ink blot as the object they saw there. The
Blacky, a projective test created by Blum
of the Michigan Psychology department,
has not been used extensively in occupa-
tional studies.
In this study, I shall attempt to deter-
mine whether or not personality factors
are associated with choice of a major field
in college {These factors being those of
the unconscious level and of early de-
velopment and structuring of the person-
ality). The major fields to be compared
are engineering and English. The author
is well aware that English does not really
represent an occupation but it is certain
that the student's occupational choice will
be very different from engineering, at
least most of the time. The stimulus for
this study has come from a study by
Teevan, another University of Michigan
Psychologist, of this very nature. He used
three broad groupings of college majors,
and scores on the Blacky Pictures. In this
study, only two major fields will be
chosen in order to place more attention in
the personality factors important in each
group and not broad comparisons. Teevan
found some significant differences in his
study: those in literature (comparable to
my English majors) had higher disturb-
ance scores on Oral Eroticism than the
other divisions, the social sciences division
had higher disturbance scores on Oral
Sadism, Oedipal Intensity, Guilt Feelings,
and Anaclitic Love Object; the science
division had the lowest disturbance scores
in nearly all categories. The engineer was
not represented in this study, but presum-
ably some of the points about scientists
can be generalized to them. Of course the
Blacky test is mostly concerned with con-
flicts in personality relationships (human
interaction), and this may represent a
reason for the few disturbances found in
the scientists. // has been hypothesized by
Roe that science division majors come out
low on disturbances on the Blacky largely
because they avoid problems in the area
of personal relationships; they are just not
interested in personal relationships or
they have effectively retreated from them.
This study by Teevan as well as Roe's
hypothesis represent the forces motivat-
ing the following study.
Before the study is reviewed some gen-
eralizations must be made about person-
ality and occupations (College majors).

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


sumed by Segal and Nachman in their
occupational studies and they also will be
assumed in this study: (Segal and Nach-
man presented occupational studies as
part of the requirement for the doctorate
in psychology from the University of
Michigan.)
1. Different occupations afford differing
opportunities for the expression of
impulses, for the utilization of de-
fenses, and for the organizing of one's
dealing with the world.
2. Occupational groups do vary signifi-
cantly from one another in important
personality characteristics, despite the
modifying and perhaps sometimes ob-
literating circumstances that all men
have basically the same impulses and
that many occupations can be bent to
serve many aims.
3. The entire range of occupations can
be described in terms of the major
personality dimensions.
The Study:
In this study, psychoanalysis and Freu-
dian psychoanalytic theory of psycho-
sexual behavior will be representative of
the point of orientation from which the
ideas of personality structure and develop-
ment will be derived. The main physical
zones of interest in this study will be the
oral and anal. Because of Teevan's study,
oral development and English majors will
be associated and because of personal in-
sight into attributes of an engineer, engi-
neers and anal development will be asso-
ciated. Greatest emphasis will be placed
on the Blacky test, thus; but, the Ror-
schach and the Thematic Apperception
Test will also be used in this study.
Oral Period:
At five years of age, each child has al-
ready gone through five years of structural
and foundational learning which will de-
termine many of the problem solving
techniques and unconscious actions he ex-
periences in the next sixty years. The rea-
son for this is that the child comes into
the world with few instinctual impulses;
this is contrary to many lower forms of
animals, and each experience is crucial
for the continuance of life and relief of
pain. He has no protection mentally or
physically against environmental dangers.
Unlike adults he has neither the strength
nor the defense mechanisms. So each ex-
perience is vital in and of itself.
The child first experiences general agi-
tation which we as adults call hunger. He,
of course, has no idea that he wants food
but after this need is fulfilled through the
nursing and feeding situation the child is
generally relieved and soon after many of
these experiences he becomes aware at
some level that nursing and relief are co-
existent. Along with nursing are the
warmth of the mother's breast, the moth-
er's protective arms, and a generally lov-
ing and protective setting during which
the child eats to survive. The experience
of hunger, general agitation, mother,
food, and love becomes such an integrated
process that the child is soon satisfied
just by love or just by mother in many
"hunger" experiences.
This orally centered stage of develop-
ment is called the incorporative mode by
the modern Freudian theorist, Erickson.
He explains that the whole skin surface
and all of the sense organs are receptive
for stimulations of many sorts. The child
is willing and able to "take in" with his
eyes what enters into his visual field. The
child anxiously and rapidly receives and
accepts all that is given to him.
When the child's teeth begin to show,
he finds a certain delight (need) in biting
on things and by contacting reality
through the mouth. The child learns that
he can now hurt things and thus enjoys
some control which, due to his strong
feelings of helplessness must be a won-
derful thrill indeed. Because the child
becomes aware of control through the
mouth, this bodily zone becomes the ini-
tially strong zone for relief of helpless-
ness and certain babbling begins in an at-
tempt for more control.
The temperment, first experiences of
rage and anger, and first experiences of
evil (comparable to Christianity's original
sin) take place during this stage. The
baby's teeth gnawing from within cause
the baby to need to bite or clamp down
on something to relieve the pain. When
this occurs on the mother's breast, she
naturally draws away. The baby becomes
angry first at his inability to hang on to
4/
the mother's breast, his food source, and
secondly his inability to relieve himself of
the internal pain. This, Erickson says, is
the origin of an evil's dividedness where
anger against gnawing teeth, anger
against the withdrawing mother, and
anger with one's impotent anger all lead
to a forceful experience of sadistic and
masochistic confusion.1
Thus, the oral stages form in the infant
the foundational qualities of a basic
awareness of trust and of evil which are
the structural aspects of hope and anxiety
in the adult personality.
The individual majoring in English is
considered generally to have many per-
sonality traits which are comparable to
learnings of the oral period. The follow-
ing list is an attempt at revealing these
theoretical points of association:
1. The English major is interested in
words and sounds which stimulate an
ecstatic feeling within him.
2. He is interested in the use of words

in order to reveal a certain point either of
form or idea primarily in order to have
some control over this form or idea.
3. The English major, like the child
during oral development, is willing and
generally able to take in as much of his
environment as possible. In other words,
he is very sensitive to things going on
around him.
4. He is interested in personal relation-
ships like love relationships, etc. which
he is constantly analyzing in literature.
5. He is interested in aspects of good
and evil, ethical standards, and moral pre-
cepts which he meets in literature con-
stantly. He is concerned with a concept
like original sin found in diverse litera-
ture from Milton to Faulkner.
6. He is interested in criticizing society
and in reading social criticisms and sa-
tires which are representative of a certain
"biting" orientation. Along with this he
is quite critical of human actions and
mostly tends to believe that in order to
have better societies we must have better
people.
7. He tends to be temperamental and
especially those who are creative writers
tend to rage easily and love quickly. In
other words, these people are moody and
of a changing temperament.
8. The English major because of his
rather flippant temperament is rather
highly anxious.
Anal Period:
After the baby's attempt to gain control
by using the oral region, he becomes
aware of control gained by withholding
feces when it is expected and giving it up
when it is least expected. The child finds
that this commodity is an extremely val-
uable source for control and that now
walking or talking or any other action
is not needed for control. This anal ex-
pulsion is so easily controlled and yet so
devastating for mother and father.
An adult's conflict over the aspects of
retention and elimination may express
themselves in a general over-restraint or
tenseness which becomes entrenched in
his personality. A person like this would
not be able to let go: he probably would
allot his time; his money; and his affec-
tion only under carefully ritualized con-
ditions and at certain times. Erickson
says that even though these traits are
typically found in the "anal" personality
that psychoanalysis reveals that this anally
fixated person "still experiences messy
fantasies and violently hostile wishes of
total elimination against selected indi-
viduals, especially those close to him who
by necessity are forced to make demands
on his inner treasures."2
Fromm, a neo-Freudian lay analyst,
speaks of the "anal" person as a hoarder
and says of him: "the hoarder will be
orderly with things, thoughts, or feelings,
but again, as with memory, his orderli-
ness is sterile and rigid. He cannot en-
dure things out of place and will auto-
matically rearrange them."3 Fromm re-
vealed the following traits which are
generally considered attributes of the
hoarding personality: practical, economi-
cal, careful, reserved, patient, cautious,
steadfast, tenacious, imperturable, com-
posed under stress, orderly, methodical,
and loyal.
In the American society, it is assumed
that early and rigorous training keeps the
home nicer and is really necessary for
orderliness and punctuality. Thus, the
American parent is quite concerned with
the rapid toilet training of his youngster.
This is the first point in the child's life
when he can learn habits of neatness,
orderliness, and punctuality and the
parent wishes deeply for the child to gain
these traits because of their importance
in our society. American society stresses
the values of initiative, discipline, orderli-
ness, and technology. These values, ac-
cording to psychoanalytic theory, are as-
sociated with the retentive and elimina-
tive modes of the anal period. On the
other hand in certain societies of India,
initiative, discipline, orderliness, and
technology are not important and along
with this toilet training never occurs be-
cause of the lack of toilets.
During this toilet training period, the
parent is telling the baby to stand on
his own two feet, to learn how to control
his bowel movements, and to deposit
them at the right time. The parent is
teaching the child independence and at
the same time he is teaching the child
certain mechanical skills and that these
skills are valuable both for him and for
father and mother. When such control is
disturbed by maldevelopments of the
child, lasting emphases are established
which will probably lead to many dis-
turbances in social attitudes. The most
common of these being attempts at con-
trolling the environmental by compulsive
systematization.
The engineering major is considered
generally to have many personality traits
which are comparable in theory to learn-
ings and experiences of the anal period.
The following list is an attempt at show-
ing these theoretical points of association:
1. The engineer works with technical
process.
2. The engineer must systematize his
work quite finely in order that his prob-
lem will have some structure to it.
3. The engineer enjoys working with
numbers and inorganic objects and con-
cepts.
4. The engineer hangs on to systems of
solving problems and feels that if he can
get into a set way of thinking about cer-
tain types of problems he will have no
trouble with them. (Specific rigor).
5. The engineer, by American social
standards, is more often than not a high
need achiever because of the profes-
sion he chooses.
6. The engineer is concerned with
practical and economical approaches to
problems.

wave transmission through superconductors. This experiment is a joint effort of a group of
Westinghouse scientists aimed at obtaining a better understanding of the nature of superconductivity.
Westinghouse Scientists Probe Secrets of Superconductivity, using...
The Coldest Cold
Temperatures within a fraction of a
degree of absolute zero are produced
routinely by Westinghouse scien-
tists in their search for more knowl-
edge of the important phenomena
ofsuperconductivity. These phenom-
ena rank with the nature of nuclear
forces as one of the most funda-
mental problems facing the theo-
retical physicist. When supercon-
ductivity is completely understood,
its principles could well revolu-
tionize the electrical and electronic
industries.
The basic principles of supercon-
ductivity have eluded an explana-
tion since 1911 when the first ex-
ample of the complete disappear-
ance of electrical resistance in metal
was discovered. Today scientists at
the Westinghouse Research Labo-
ratories in Pittsburgh, are making
significant contributions to the field
by their low-temperature research.
Superconductivity occurs in cer-
tain metals, alloys and compounds
which, below characteristic transi-
tion temperatures, completely lose
their electrical resistance. While in
this superconducting state, they are
perfectly diamagnetic, i.e. will com-
pletely exclude magnetic flux when
placed in a magnetic field.
While this fundamental research
is being conducted by theoretical
physicists in search of knowledge
and understanding of first principles,
from even the terse description above
of superconductivity, the imagina-
tion begins to run wild with engi-
neering applications. An electronic
computer using superconductivity
memory elements will switch 10,000
times faster than conventional com-
puter elements, will store 10 times
as much information per unit space
as ordinary computers. If the con-
ditions can be fulfilled to make a
substance superconductive in tem-
perature regions other than that
around absolute zero, design of every
electrical or electronic product will
be radically changed. Imagine con-
sidering the commonest electrical de-
sign problem without having to take
into account electrical resistance!
While these exciting considera-
tions whet the imagination, they are
not the primary object of the low-
temperature research going on at
Westinghouse. This and many other
research projects are being conducted
to discover new phenomena and new
knowledge of the universe. It is done
on the belief that all research is an
investment in tomorrow.
To the young, creative engineer
this means exciting opportunities for
graduate engineers in these exciting
fields:

AUTOMATION SEMICONDUCTORS
JET-AGE METALS ELECTRONICS

FatU No. 1: CINDERELVIS ty Larry Savage
Once upon a time there was an engineering transfer stu-
dent named Elvis Enthalpy. As engineering students go, and
that isn't very far, this young man was a lost cause. Although
our young hero was not too bright, his heart was pure and his
cause was noble. Unfortunately, he was also frustrated.
Many years ago Elvis' family was one of the more respected
clans in Alabama. However, his parents were picked up
scalping tickets for the State (Alabama State) game, and
were quickly whisked off to the local dungeon. His fiancee
suffered from a Narcissus complex, and drowned while looking
at her reflection in a small puddle of water in the kitchen sink.
It is with these tragic facts of history that our saga begins.
With his main source of income out of the picture for the next
twenty-five years, young Elvis found himself in a tight spot.
Tuition at Midwestern University had gone up, and room and
board rates were at an all time high. For a while Elvis strug-
gled with the situation, raising Boll-Weevils on the side to
help defray expenses. However, the bottom dropped out of the
Weevil market when one of the local merchants dumped a
load of African Weevils on the market at cut-rate prices.
With a flash of inspiration, Elvis decided that a fra-
ternity would be the answer to his problems. Living at the
fraternity would be a lot cheaper, he thought, and he could
also sponge off his fraternity brothers for a while. Gradually it
dawned upon him that no fraternity would ever have him
for a brother, let alone pledge him. Being an engineer was
bad enough, but twice he was caught carrying a slide rule
across the Law Quad, and was stoned with leftover dessert
from the previous night's dinner.
But, as in all fables, a miracle happened, and he was
pledged. Not to any old fraternity, but to Tri-Gulp, the titan
of all the fraternities.
After a semester, however, our young hero realized that
he was pledged only to be the fraternity fop and fall-guy.
When he wasn't mopping floors, he was cleaning out the fire-
place and emptying cinders in the back yard. Elvis was in
such a perpetual state of filth and griminess, that one of the
brothers called him cinderelvis, a name which stuck.
One night as Elvis was alone in his room in the cellar coal-
bin, he began to think about the coming President's Grand
Ball. All week he had been working slavishly for the brothers,
helping them in their preparations for the great event.
Now the big event was one night off, and he was confined
to the coal bin like a prisoner. He thought of leaving the
fraternity, but was so far in debt that the brothers would not
let him go. As he lay on his pallet, bemoaning his unfortunate
situation, there was a knock on the cellar door.
"Come on in, it ain't locked," he called out.
Cinderelvis looked up and saw a fat little old man with
white whiskers and rosy red cheeks. The stranger's eyes were
glassy as if he had been drinking.
"You been drinkin'?" Cinderelvis asked.
"Hell no," replied the little old man with a chuckle, as he
walked into the furnace.
"Well, what do you want," asked Cinderelvis. "You better
say your piece quick like, mister, and get out of here."
"Now, now son, let's not be rude to your elders, "the old
man replied. "I'm your fairy Godprofessor, and I'm here to
help you."
"HELL, you are drunk, old man. You'd better bug out of
here quick before someone catches you, or we'll both get
racked up. I'm under twenty-one, you know."
"Ah, Cinderelvis, shining example of the younger genera-
tion, you have as little faith as all of your compatriots."
"Okay friend, speak your piece and buzz off, will you."
The little old man sat down next to Cinderelvis and wiped
his sleeve across his mouth. "I don't suppose you have some-
thing to wet an old man's thirst, do you?"
The younger fellow nodded.
"Just as well, just as well." The old man looked at Cinder-
elvis and his eyes lit up. "Young man, how would you like
to go to the Presidents' Grand Ball?"
Cinderelvis jumped up and put his hands on the old man's
shoulders. "Do you mean it. Do you really mean it?"
My dubious young friend, when I say something, so
be it!"
Cinderelvis reached behind the furnace and pulled, out a
bottle of brew." Here, have a drink, "he said to the old man.
"Thank you, young man. But first, listen quickly. Tomor-
row night, after the sun goes down, meet me behind the Me-
chanical Engineering building." The old man took a quick
swig, and then disappeared as quickly as he had entered.
Then next night, after all of the fraternity brothers had left
for the Ball, Cinderelvis hopped on his bicycle and went
directly to the Mechanical Engineering building. Sure enough:
there behind the building was the fairy-Godprofessor.
"We'll have to work quickly," the old man said. Leading
Cinderelvis, he went in the back entrance and into a large
laboratory.
With a wide sweep of his hand, he pointed out the room
to Cinderelvis. "Well, here is your trip to the Ball."
Cinderelvis looked around in amazement. "Man, you're
nuts. All I see are wierd machines, and a pile of scrap metal."
The little old man walked over to the scrap pile and
picked up a hunk of SAE 1020 steel. Pulling a flask out of
his back pocket, he waved it over the metal, uttering the in-
cantation: "Etothex, dy, dx." A wierd blue glow coursed
over the metal, and a strange transformation took place: the
piece of steel turned into a pint of gin. Carefully, the old man
held the bottle up to his lips and drank the contents.
Cinderelvis was quite perturbed. "Hey old man, this ain't
the way it's done in the movies. You're supposed to make a
coach or something for me. You got your numbers crossed, or
something. (Continued on page i8)

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


in the field of Combustion
Historically, the process of combus-
tion has excited man's insatiable
hunger for knowledge. Since his
most primitive attempts to make
use of this phenomenon, he has
found tremendous fascination in its
potentials.
Perhaps at no time in history has
that fascination been greater than
it is today with respect to the use
of combustion principles in the
modern aircraft engine.
At Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft,
theorems of many sciences are being
applied to the design and develop-
ment of high heat release rate de-
vices. In spite of the apparent sim-
plicity of a combustion system, the
bringing together of fuel and air in
proper proportions, the ignition of
the mixture, and the rapid mixing
of burned and unburned gases in-
volves a most complex series of
interrelated events — events ocur-
ring simultaneously in time and
space.
Although the combustion engi-
neer draws on many fields of science
(including thermodynamics, aero-
dynamics, fluid mechanics, heat
transfer, applied mechanics, metal-
lurgy and chemistry), the design of
combustion systems has not yet
been reduced to really scientific
principles. Therefore, the highly
successful performance of engines
like the J-57, J-75 and others stands
as a tribute to the vision, imagina-
tion and pioneering efforts of those
at Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft en-
gaged in combustion work.
While combustion assignments,
themselves, involve a diversity of
engineering talent, the field is only
one of a broadly diversified engi-
neering program at Pratt &amp; Whitney
Aircraft. That program—with other
far-reaching activities in the fields
of instrumentation, materials prob-
lems, mechanical design and aero-
dynamics — spells out a gratifying
future for many of today's engi-
neering students.
Mounting an afterburner in a special high-altitude test
chamber in PSWA's Willgoos Turbine Laboratory permits
study of a variety of combustion problems which
may be encountered during later development stages.
Microflash photo illustrates one continuing
problem: design and development of fuel
injection systems which properly atomize
and distribute under all flight conditions.

interpretations, very orderly and ex-
tremely methodical.
It is very important to remember in
any study of this nature that these traits
expressed here may very easily appear in
the English major's personality also to a
certain extent as can those traits former-
ly expressed be part of the engineering
major's personality. We are, here, merely
revealing certain trends in behavior and
believe that each of the diverse fields con-
tains more of the one than the other.
Another important point to remember
is that when a person experiences weak
development during the oral period it is
likely that he will receive poor training in
each succeeding stage also. Thus it would
appear that the English major would have
more complexes than the engineering ma-
jor. The Blacky should back this up too,
because it is most generally concerned
with personal relationships which is also
true of the English major. It would seem
that the engineer might show fewer com-
plexes on the Blacky because of his re-
treat from personal relationships.
Hypotheses:
With this accumulation of ideas and
associations, one should be able to come
up with many inferences. The following
hypotheses are concerned with the Blacky,
Rorschach, and T.A.T. tests and the per-
sonality structures of third or fourth year
undergraduate students majoring in either
English language or literature, or engi-
neering (which includes six fields: aero-
nautical, civil, chemical, mechanical, in-
dustrial, and electrical).
Blacky:
1. The engineers should show stronger
scores on the anal sadistic picture than
the English majors.
2. The English majors should show
stronger scores on the oral eroticism and
oral sadism pictures than the engineers.
3. The engineers should show strong-
er scores on the positive identification
picture than the English majors.
4. The English majors should show
stronger results on the Blacky as a whole
than the engineers.
5. The English majors should make
(Continued from page 44)
more personal and human references than
the engineers.
T.A.T. (Using the Murray system):
1. The engineers should show a strong-
er need for achievement than the English
majors.
2. The English majors should show a
stronger need for affiliation than the engi-
neers.
3. The engineers should show a strong-
er need for order than the English majors.
4. The engineers should have a greater
need for recognition than the English
majors.
5. The English majors should have a
stronger need for dominance than the
engineers.
6. The English major should show a
stronger need for aggression than the
engineer.
7. The English major should be con-
cerned more than the engineer with per-
sonal relationships and especially the feel-
ings of the characters.
8. The English major should pass
moral and ethical judgment on the T.A.T.
characters more often than the engineers.
Rorschach:
1. The English majors should see each
inkblot as a whole, fitting each part into
an organized whole, more often than the
engineer.
2. The engineer should more often
take out the major blot in the inkblot
arrangement and call it something rather
than organize all of the parts into a whole
pattern.
3. The English majors should be more
sensitive to colors.
4. The engineer should see more in-
organic objects while the English major
should see more organic in the inkblots.
If it is humanely and financially pos-
sible, this study will be carried out within
the next few years at this University. The
preceding only represents a theoretical
outline of what is expected and why
these results are expected. I want to ex-
tend my thanks to Joseph Veroff and
Richard Cutler, both of our Psychology
department, for their guidance and in-
sight.

A Campus-to-Career Case History
The future looks unlimited"
"I wanted a career that offered variety, op-
portunity and a chance to work with people,"
says Lewis William Post, C.E., Michigan State,
1950. "So I chose the telephone company.
"My initial training—two full years of it-
probed every phase of company operations and
acquainted me with all of the jobs in the Plant
Department, where I was starting.
"Today, as Plant Engineer, I'm responsible
for preventive maintenance of all field equip-
ment, installation of new facilities for wire and
cable, and I work with architects and builders
on telephone needs in new buildings.
"Selling's part of my job, too. I sell ideas
—like the wisdom of planning for telephone
service when you're building. Recently I ad-
vised an architect and an owner on telephone
wiring and outlets in a new $160,000 medical
center. I enjoy getting in on the ground floor
of such projects and making contributions
both as a civil and a telephone engineer.
"In my area of Chicago there are 80,000
telephones, home and business. More are be-
ing added every day. There's expansion every-
where in the telephone business—all across the
country. To me, the future looks unlimited."
Lew Post's career is with Illinois Bell Telephone
Company. Many interesting career opportuni-
ties exist in other Bell Telephone Companies,
Bell Telephone Laboratories, Western Electric
and Sandia Corporation. Your placement officer

STANDARDS OF
TECHNICAL WRITING
The responsibility for better communication in
the field of engineering lies directly upon the
engineer; the ability to express himself clearly
and logically is as important today as are his
technical capabilities. No man is an island,
no mind a private estate; the bridge to gap the
worlds of engineering complexities can only
be built upon a foundation of clear concise
thought and standardized expression.
In any discussion of progress, the
strongest positive argument is that it
creates new ideas and new fields of
learning and understanding. It also
creates new problems, but hand-in-hand
these present new stimuli and challenges,
without which civilization would become
stagnant.
Within the past few decades the amaz-
ing strides made in the realm of science
and engineering have created a myriad
of by-product fields, which, in time, have
evolved into positions of prominence on
a par with the old stand-bys of technical
research, development, and marketing.
Coming into its own today is the field of
Technical Writing, born of necessity, al-
though fostered in a state of occasional
confusion.
The explosive growth of technology
and its importance on the social scene has
been so phenomenal that society has more
often than not been unable to adjust itself
to the many changes. With the develop-
ment and advancement of technology
there has been a corresponding tendency
toward specialization, and a breakdown
of science and engineering into separate
and distinct channels. Not only is science
rapidly drifting away from the world
around it, but even those in the scientific
field are finding themselves on increas-
ingly less familiar ground with their own
contemporaries.
As the scientific breakdown becomes
more and more complex aand specialized,
so too do the tools utilized take on signifi-
cances all their own. Technical language
becomes less general, and in the channels
of specialization, take on new and distinct
meanings. New words and phrases are
created by the technician with special
meanings to fit his own particular use.
However, science, like any other field
of knowledge, cannot exist in an expres-
sive vacuum. A theory is good only if it
can be put to application, or utilized for
the development of other theories. A
product becomes worthless unless it can
be put on the market and used. So, too,
does technical knowledge become worth-
less unless it can be readily utilized. If the
technological world is becoming more
and more specialized, then there must be
adequate liaison, not only within the field
itself, but with outside fields as well. The
key word is communication: without it
there can be no progress.
It is in this environment that technical
writing has come of age. One answer to
the accusative cries of "specialization" in
the realm of technology is the improve-
ment in the standards of presentation of
technical information. One reason why we
should make an effort for such an im-
provement is that, today, the technician
has a big responsibility toward his mother
tongue. Never before has it been so great.
Today technical literature makes up a
large proportion of the nation's output of
printed matter; there is enough of it to
set the pattern of our national speech.
Many of us have read scores of pages
written by scientists or engineers to every
one written by men of letters.
Professor R. O. Kapp, of the University
of London, in his lectures on "The Pre-
sentation of Technical Information" rec-
ognized another interesting point that has
become a product of the times:'" . . . and
if, as now seems likely as a result of the
moral leadership acquired by the English
speaking nations, our language will be

Today's classroom is no longer
bounded by books and blackboards.
For our children, school is big as the
world of sight and sound itself.
RCA has sent the electron to school
—in TV sets, radios, "Victrolas,"® rec-

And with all this, valued help for
teachers who must make fullest use of
our overcrowded classrooms.

The applications are endless.
Through its leadership in electronics,
RCA contributes a great deal to the
success of this new and broader kind of
education. In fact, helping our on-

WRITING
(Continued from page 46)
known in other lands chiefly through our
technical literature."
The popular notion of the scientist as a
recluse who makes great discoveries lock-
ed away in the solitude of his laboratory,
was, in bygone days, sometimes true of
the pure scientist. It is rarely so now.
And it has never been true of the engi-
neer, for his accomplishments would be
limited without the cooperation of others.
The engineer's day is crowded with con-
ferences, talks, and meetings. His contacts
with people are numerous and varied. In
all of these communication is the com-
mon denominator. Talk and paper are the
engineer's most important tools. He must
learn to handle them effectively.
Quite often the engineer forgets that
he has an obligation to those concerned
with the work he is undertaking. The
engineer's written results may contain an
impressive volume of profound thinking;
yet, many times it will fail to be very ef-
fective. While the engineer may be con-
vinced that his ideas and thoughts have
been adequately and clearly expressed,
be is often unaware that hard work is in-
volved in the process of transferring
thoughts from mind to mind. Many times
the engineer will be content to let the
reader tangle and grapple with his work.
Here his obligation fall short of fulfill-
ment.
Perhaps, if the author has little of
value to say, he may well indulge in an
obscure style. In this stead his contribu-
tion may escape criticism, and his efforts
will be measured by their builk, and not
their content. If the author's material is
worthless, he would be better off unread-
able; he will then not be immediately
found out.
Steps for Better Communication
There exist two fundamental means for
better liaison between the engineer and
other minds. Primarily, the engineer must
be more adequately trained to better ex-
press himself, and be able to clearly and
properly present his ideas in easily grasp-
ed form.* At the same time, the author
must not sacrifice style for terseness.
No one expects the engineer to become
a "Sliderule Shakespeare," but neither
will the author gain merit for work
that is drab, dull, and disinteresting. It is
not to be expected that a report on the
thermodynamic properties of lightweight
metals will keep a reader gripped in a
state of white-hot anxiety or tension,
feverishly pouring over each word.
Neither must the technical report or the
presentation of ideas be reduced to the
level of a grocery list of facts.
It is beyond the scope of an article of
this nature to present a basic course in
English for engineers. However, with a
little common sense and honest effort, the
engineer can readily compile and present
his ideas in a manner he may well be
proud of. In the presentation of technical
information, the engineer must be aware
of three fundamentals in the construc-
tion of his work.
First, he must know what his particu-
lar problem is all about. The engineer,
after working on a project, or formulat-
ing ideas for a new effort, must not only
merely understand his problem to suit
himself, but must have it mastered enough
so that others will understand it. He must
be able to not only define the situation,
but define the theme that he hopes will
adequately put across his situation. He
must know what it is all about well
enough to prevent any wrong idea or
misapprehensions.
Secondly, the author must make his
work easy to understand. With the use of
logical reasoning, proper utility of words
and phrases, and clarity of style, the
writer should be able to feel, with justifi-
cation that the reader will have approxi-
mately the same understanding of the
problem as he has. As a handy tool for
clarification, he has at his disposal graphs,
charts, and illustrations. If one picture is
worth a thousand words, then one prop-
erly prepared graph may well be worth
many man-hours of bull-dog effort.
Lastly, the written work must be easily
remembered. The reader may go over a
paper and claim to fully understand the
contents, but if he later questions himself
on just exactly what it was that he read,
the report has actually failed in its pur-
pose. The reader must at all times be able
to carry away with him key ideas. The
engineer can eliminate the non-rememor-
able hazard from his written papers by
using techniques such as showing the rele-
vance of information in the report to
previously known facts; by using associa-

engaged in activities of international im-
port would render both ST and MT super-
fluous. It is the formula of "world-wide
acceptance of Interlingua" that is respons-
ible for the suspicious smell in this ap-
proach. Obviously, there can be no abjec-
tion to an occasional author's using Inter-
lingua in either oral or written communi-
cation, but to set up that kind of proce-
dure as the ideal rule for a future worthy
of our hopes and aspirations would take
cause no apparatus has been set up to
carry his message to speakers of other
tongues. This is where MT, ST, and In-
terlingua come in, singly or in combina-
tion.
The fact that mankind is of many lan-
guages does present us with difficult
problems, but the solution of these prob-
lems cannot lie in forcing us all to use
monotonously (and on the whole badly)
one single identical language in all inter-
us straight back into the realm of naive
and unrealistic propaganda of numerous
world-language enthusiasts of the past.
The ideal international communica-
tion is not that everybody can tell every-
body else in one identical language how
glad he is to see him or that he believes
the weather will change but rather that
everybody with a significant idea in his
head may state it in whatever language he
can use most effectively, without the risk
of being understood by himself alone be-
national intercourse. Let many flowers
bloom (as Mao said with unexpected
grace), for each is the best by its own
standards. If we hold on to what we
know about common norms, diversity will
not preclude communion.
Application of Interlingua or Interlingua
In Use Today
The number of people who have an
active (writing and speaking) mastery
of Interlingua is not known. It cannot
be known because there is no organization
to which they all do or should belong.
There is and there must be no "Inter-
lingua movement."*
No major utilization of Interlingua de-
pends in any sense on the number of
people who can use the language actively
but only on the fact that messages in it
are accessible to the vast majority of those
interested in the subject matter.
There is no general "promotion" and
"publicity" in favor of Interlingua. The
Interlingua Division of Science Service
sees its job rather in the identification of
areas in which Interlingua can be useful
and in the subsequent demonstration of
such usefulness for the benefit of those
in responsible positions.
The principal area in which the utility
of Interlingua has been established is that
of abstracts in learned publications. The
critical student of the periodical literature
in any particular field is aware of the fact
that a great deal of valuable material is
lost to the world at large because it was
published in not generally accessible lan-
guages and still more because it was pub-
lished in indigestible form in a "major"
language which the author thought he
mastered but did not. The system of sup-
plying routinely Interlingua abstracts for
all original articles has now been adopted
by some twenty major and minor research
periodicals. The majority of these are as
yet United States publications. Some
Latin-American publications have follow-
ed suit. So far they have not seen fit to
liberalize their editorial policies in regard
to language restrictions imposed upon
manuscript submissions. But it is to be
hoped that the availability of Interlingua
abstracts will hasten the day when the
individual author can freely choose what-
ever language he knows can serve his
purpose best.
The four short years within which
Interlingua has proved its usefulness in
periodical publications have also witness-
* There is, it is true, an organization call-
ed Union Mundial pro interlingua, with head-
quarters in Basel, Switzerland, but this is
specifically concerned with promoting the use
of interlingua in personal correspondence.

ed its utilization in the programs of seven
major international congresses in the field
of medicine. In several of these "volumes
of abstracts of papers read,'1 the languages
used were (1) the language of the orig-
inal manuscript and (2) Interlingua. In
other instances the two languages used
were (1) that of the country where the
congress was held and (2) again Inter-
lingua. The first of these two possibilities
seems preferable.
The Interlingua Division of Science
Service is available as a mediator in per-
sonal professional correspondence be-
tween scientists of mutually incomprehen-
sible languages. Readers of letters thus
serviced receive Interlingua translations
which they may substitute for the orig-
inals or use as a help in their effort to
cope with the foreign text which they
can "almost" make out.
An interesting experiment, not yet ex-
tensively tried, is concerned with helping
professional audiences follow the pre-
sentation of special lecturers invited from
abroad. In this system, an English-speak-
ing lecturer addressing for instance a
Latin-American audience would supply an
Interlingua symopsis of his English talk,
projecting it in a running series of slides.
A field of considerable potential use-
fulness of Interlingua is that of newslet-
ters in highly specialized fields of restrict-
ed but international appeal. A very suc-
cessful example of this procedure is
Spectroscopia Molecular, a multilithed
typewritten monthly, published by Dr.
Forrest F. Cleveland of the Illinois In-
stitute of Technology, with a list of sub-
scribers of some 800 names in all parts of
the world.
Apart from these and similar "imme-
diate" applications of Interlingua, men-
tion must be made of at least one area of
potential "long-term" utility of the lan-
guage. This evolves from the fact that a
terminology in Interlingua for any par-
ticular field of research constitutes an in-
ternational standard: there are no in-
vented terms in Interlingua, yet the terms
it does use never coincide with the forms
used in English or French or Spanish, etc.,
unless these latter happen to reflect the
consensus of all the languages involved.
Now, the development of modern tech-
nical and scientific terminologies is a
major problem in many of the world's
languages, including several of high cul-
tural value and a venerable past. It is ob-
viously unrealistic to expect Hebrew or
Hindi or Arabic or Malay to willingly
model their technical neologisms after
French or English or Spanish usage. On
the other hand, to suggest that such lan-
guages heed the example of international
usage is both realistic and logical, for
almost all the corresponding concepts
are felt to be international, i.e. hailing
from many languages rather than from
one. Of course, "international usage" is
only another term for "Interlingua." The
pioneering venture in this area was the
preparation of an Interlingua version of
a proposed nomenclature of arthritic dis-
eases, published as an appendix to the
program of the Ninth International Con-
gress on Rheumatism (Toronto, 1957).
The fact that Interlingua seeks out
areas in which its application can be of
concretely practical service has occasion-
ally led to the erroneous impression that
it is not really a language but merely a
"code." Actually Interlingua is rich in
literary subtleties owing to its derivation
from the living languages of the Occident.
Lincoln's Gettysburg Address or the
Lord's Prayer have a beauty of their own
in interlingua, exactly as they would in
French or Spanish or German or Russian.
The reason so little is normally made of
this aspect of the matter is simply that
it is hard to see what good it would do to
put the Gettysburg Address and the
Lord's Prayer into Interlingua (except
perhaps that it might be fun).
A different matter is the question of
Interlingua's "cultural representation."
The present report has no room for so vast
a topic of independent significance. But
let there be at least the concluding prom-
ise that the student of Interlingua senses
quickly that he is dealing with a language
which owes its all to the cultural homo-
geneity of the Western World and which
stands for that homogeneity both as a
symptom and as a symbol.

CAREERS WITH BECHTEL
Porter Thompson, Assistant Chief Engineer, Refinery Division
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
One of a series of interviews in which
Bechtel Corporation executives discuss
career opportunities for college men.
Question: Mr. Thompson, some en-
gineering graduates seem to believe
their first jobs might include little
more than filing papers. Would that
be true at Bechtel?
Thompson: It would not. When the
young man joins the Refinery Divi-
sion, if he is a structural engineer he
starts immediately to do structural de-
sign work, under proper supervision.
An electrical engineer would join our
electrical group, working on electri-
cal systems for refineries, doing some
design work, taking off materials and
working on instrumentation.
Question: What about mechanical
engineers?
Thompson: Mechanical and chemi-
cal engineers may either go right into
the process department, where they
would do calculations, or into the
project group where they would do
routine designing and write specifica-
tions for pumps, exchangers, vessels,
piping, instrumentation, insulation,
etc.
Question: There's certainly no sign
of "paper shuffling," is there?
Thompson: No. The training period
is interesting right from the start.
After a few months, we like to send
the young engineer out into the field
so he can see the end result of what
he has been doing.
Question: What has been your
experience as to the length of time
required to train a man?
Thompson: That will vary according
to the man, so it's impossible to gen-
eralize. The young man will have
some responsibility right from the
start, but it may well be a matter of
several years before he can actually
take full responsibility for running
a job.
Question: Assuming he handles his
first assignments satisfactorily, what
would be his first major step upward?
Thompson: After from 6 to 9 months
his first responsible assignment might
be on a project in connection with
handling pumps. On his next project
assignment he might have the re-
sponsibility for handling pumps and
exchangers. He would likely be
assigned some other responsibility on
each succeeding project. In that way
he would get a good grasp of all types
of work and eventually be capable
of taking overall charge of a project.
Question: Suppose he is in the
structural phase; would there be any
difference in his "basic training"?
Thompson: No. He would still have
to serve his apprenticeship, moving
gradually into more and more com-
plex design work as he gains, a little
at a time, the knowledge and experi-
ence which qualify him to handle the
overall job.
Bechtel Corporation (and its Bechtel
foreign subsidiaries) designs, engineers

tions to tie together the thoughts and
ideas in the report; and by the use of
stand-out words and phrases that will
make a definite impression in the read-
er's mind.
These keys to better communication are
merely the framework to better writing,
however. Only by practice and concerted
effort can the engineer add flesh to the
body of his compositions. Fine points,
such as the use of good metaphors, avoid-
neer become better trained in writing is
the potentially dangerous one of having
others do his writing for him. Men skill-
ed in the proficiencies of creative writing
may be ultimately versed in technology
to get a better understanding of the field
they are to write about. This solution,
however, only tends to make the engi-
neer more pencil-or typewriter-shy, and
pushes him into a dependence upon the
hired writer. The use of a professional
Larry Selwitz, author of Stand-
ards of Technical Writing, re-
ceived his B.A. degree in Eng-
lish from a "small New England
College," the name of which he
guards like a guided missile sec-
ret. Larry is currently enrolled in
the Mechanical Engineering de-
partment, taking an instrumenta-
tion option. This summer he de-
signed equipment for the U. S.
Navy Underwater Sound Lab.
Larry is a member of the Nation-
al Editors and Technical Writers
Association, and past president
of Sigma Rho Tau.
ance of generalization, and proper tim-
ing come only through constant writing
effort.
No engineer is expected to be a cham-
pion speller or prose stylist. However,
there is no excuse for careless and illiter-
ate writing, nor for illogical thinking and
ignorance of technical matters. The engi-
neer whose literary faults are these creates
suspicion on the part of the reader as to
the basic technical capabilities of the au-
thor. Illogical thinking as is evident in
writing may lead the reader to suspect
such a fault on the part of the engineer
not only in his writing, but in his field
and laboratory work as well. Carelessness
and ignorance of technical matters are
like signposts that blare out in black and
white the engineer's basic shortcomings.
An engineer is only as good as others
see him. If his credentials, self-written
and self-expressed, speak poorly for him,
he has only himself to blame.
The one alternative to having the engi-
journalist, at best, is only a stop-gap
measure. When the subject being written
about becomes more and more complex,
the only one able to explain it will be the
engineer directly concerned with it.
One solution might be to have a com-
promise from using entirely the engineer
or professional writer on a technical re-
port. Proper effort on the part of the engi-
neer to clearly present the facts in un-
polished form would be the first step. The
professional writer would then rework the
information given to him by the engineer
and produce, in conjunction with the
engineer, a presentable work, both from a
literary and scientific view-point.
In the final analysis, however, the re-
sponsibility for proper liaison in engi-
neering falls squarely and singularly up-
on the engineer. Only through determined
and honest effort in the field of clear
and concise expression can the engineer
gain full stature as a truly professional
man.
The Battle Is On
A hasty glance at the classified section
of the metropolitan daily newspapers un-
covers plea after plea for "technical writ-
ers." Recruiting teams from all phases
of industry, in their rampant march
through the nation's colleges and univer-
sities in search of engineering potential,
cast covetous glances at those prospectives
who also exhibit the facility for creative
writing. Technical writing, as a profes-
sion, is as lucrative today as is engineer-
ing in general.*
However, even the unlikely prospect
known as technical writing has fallen prey
to that evil of the times, specialization.
The technical writer is now an engineer-
ing specialist himself, relieving other
engineers of the major portion of the re-
sponsibility for production of all publica-
tions required as a result of engineering
work. Many industrial firms no longer
recognize the "quaint" old term of "Tech-
nical Writer", but instead point with
pride to their newest euphenistic creation,
the Publications Engineer, or Engineering
Writer. According to one large Eastern
electronics and instrument corporation,
the publications engineer . . . "writes
technical material, plans and directs prep-
aration of copy, and carries through on all
details concerned with actual production
of the publication. // is necessary to re-
peat that he is first an engineer, then i
writer, and finally a publications man."
Upon inquiry to this corporation for
more information about publications en-
gineering, the latter replied that indeed
publications engineering was a challenge.
They did not believe that the work of a
writer should be the menial and mechani-
cal task of merely finishing someone
else's report. They wholeheartedly agreed
that engineering writing should be both
interesting and challenging, as well as
creative in nature.
A few months after this enlightening
letter, in April of this year to be exact,
the publications coordinator of that cor-
poration lectured before the Southeastern
Michigan chapter of the Association of
Technical Writers and Editors. Armed to
the teeth with charts and slides, this
speaker neatly slashed away at the prettv
picture of technical writing as it existed

Walking over to a 5 HP DC generator, the fairy-Godpro-
fessor waved the magic flask over the mechanism, and lo and
behold, there was now a hugh beautiful coach.
"Where are the horses?" Elvis cried. "It ain't the real thing
without horses."
'My good friend," the old man said, "This coach is elec-
trically driven; you don't need horses. As for coachmen and
drivers, you may have the use of my student assistants."
The old man, looked around. "Something is missing, he
said. "Ah yes, now I know. You, young man, are the last
thing we have to take care of."
"What's the matter?" asked Cinderelvis.
The old man eyed him carefully for a while. "I've seen
some pretty grubby people in my life, but you are the most
miserable I've ever seen."
"You wouldn't look so hot yourself if you hadn't shaved in
a week."
Reaching on the table, the old man pulled out a package.
"What's that? asked Cinderelvis.
"That, my dear friend, is the Sears and Roebuck Grand
Ball Special, complete from tie to shoelaces." Cinderelvis put
the new clothes on and was ready for the grand ball.
The old man looked at Cinderelvis with pride. "You look
fine, Cinderelvis, fine. But, I must give you some advice: when
the clock strikes midnight you must leave the ball. After that
time the spell will be broken and you will be as miserable
as ever."
Minutes later, in his new electric coach, Cinderelvis pulled
up to the President's mansion in style royal. Brushing the lint
off his patent leather shoes, he stepped out of his coach, ably
assisted by the fine looking coachmen.
Inside the hall where the dancing was going on, Cinderelvis
could see all the Tri-Gulp fraternity men with their dates. It
then occurred to him that he did not have a date. Suddenly,
out of the corner of his blood-shot eye he saw a beautiful
young co-ed standing in the midst of a group of senior Lit.
majors.
Strutting across the floor, he edged his" way through the
crowd of men and walked up to the beautiful young lady.
Without saying a word he took her hand and led her onto the
dance floor.
As in all fables, whether they be in the Technic or not, the
beautiful young coed fell madly in love with the daring young
stranger.
"Who are you," she asked brilliantly.
"One who is mad about you," he answered even more
brilliantly.
"Can you do EM 2 problems?" she whispered softly in
his ear.
"Stress equals Force over cross sectional area," he whisper-
ed back to her. He was about to apply the clincher, and tell
her the formula for beam deflection, when the clock struck
midnight.
"I must leave," he said apologetically.
"Please stay," she urged, "Daddy is President of the Uni-
versity, and he can get you a late per, if that is what is both-
ering you."
"I must leave," he said, and began to run out of the hall as
his patent leather shoes turned to dirty white bucks. He turned
to say a final farewell, but his upper plate fell out and bounced
behind the buffet table.
Outside he hopped into the coach and bade the driver to
be quickly on his way. Two miles down the road however, the
clock struck the final ominous gong of midnight. A heavy rain-
storm broke loose and poured over the coach. The rain began
corroding the metal coach, which quickly turned into a pile of
rust. Footing it the rest of the way, Cinderelvis, now his usual
grubby self, made it back to the Tri-Gulp house.
The next morning the Midwestern Dully headlined this
story: "Prexy's Daughter Seeks Mystery Student." During
lunch all the Tri-Gulp brothers were heatedly discussing the
sensational campus event.
"I'll bet the president's daughter was beautiful," said
Cinderelvis.
"Watch your tongue, pledge!" admonished one of the
brothers.
At that moment there was a knock on the door. "Open the
door, Cinderelvis," ordered one of the brothers.
Cinderelvis opened the door and in stepped the dean of
men. With him were the head of SGC and a staff member of
the Midu estern Technic.
"Gentlemen," said the Dean, I have been instructed to find
the mystery student. Whoever he is, he shall marry the presi-
dent's daughter, graduate with highest honors, get two tickets
for all home football games, and be given membership to any
honor society of his choice."
"How are you going to find the mystery student, Dean?"
asked one of the students anxiously
Reaching into his coat pocket, the Dean pulled out a set
of false teeth. "Easy," replied the Dean. "The mystery student
lost his upper plate at the grand ball last night. Whoever these
teeth fit is our mystery student, and to him shall go the re-
wards, and the hand of the president's daughter."
"Hey man, let me slip them things in my mouth," called
out a psychology major, who had been reading a newspaper
while standing on his head.
"Now Napoleon," called out another brother, "you know
"you got all your teeth."
The president of the fraternity went up to the Dean. "1
guess none of us are lucky this time, Dean; we all have ou&gt;
own teeth. That is, all except Cinderelvis. But it couldn't be
his."
"Perhaps you are right," replied the Dean, "but I am
under orders to try anyone to whom the teeth might belong.
Handing the teeth to Cinderelvis, the Dean told him to try
them for fit.
Cinderelvis opened his mouth and popped the plate in.
The fit couldn't have been more perfect if they were his nat-
ural teeth. The brothers gasped in amazement as the Dean
took Cinderelvis and led him out of the house and into the
sunlight.
And so Cinderelvis married the president's daughter, cut
all the rest of his classes, got elected to Tau Beta Pi, graduated
with honors, and received two tickets (in the end zone) to
all the home football games.
Fable writer's note: Cinderelvis later transferred to Mid-
eastern University where he eventually got an education.

High-Temperature Optical Strain
Gauge Used
To Test New Alloys
Testing of materials will never become
routine as long as new materials are de-
veloped and older ones are improved.
This is particularly true in the case of
alloys designed for 1200 and 1250 de-
gree F operating temperatures. Where do
you find delicate instruments to measure
physical properties of alloys at such tem-
peratures? In some instances, the building
of an instrument to do the job involves
almost as much work as the development
of the alloy itself.
One important metal property required
is the variation in modulus of elasticity at
elevated temperatures, Also vital is the
degree of surface strains incurred by heat
cycling.
To obtain this information, engineers
of the Westinghouse Materials Engineer-
ing Department adapted for high-tem-
perature service a standard optical gauge
used for measuring strains at room tem-
perature.
The small instrument, roughly -y2
inches long by % inches wide by % m"
ches high, consists of a metal framework
to hold two tiny mirrors, one stationary
and the other movable. The mirrors are
mounted on blocks of Refractaloy alloy,
which have one knife edge that contacts
the sample. In operation, the gauge is
clamped to the metal surface, a beam of
light is aimed at one mirror, reflected to
the other mirror and then back to light
source, where a scale indicates the angle
of the return beam of light. When the
sample is heated to test temperatures, the
movable knife-edge rotates lightly, chang-
ing the mirror angle and in turn the light
beam return angle. Since there is no me-
chanical linkage between the strain gauge
and the measuring device, an extremely
high degree of accuracy is possible. With
proper calibration, changes as small as 20
millionths of an inch can be detected.
The chief difficulty from a materials
standpoint in adapting the room tempera-
ture gauge to a high-temperature gauge
was the mirror surfaces. A successful com-
bination consisted of silver brazing a
V» 5/16 mcn striP °f 30-mil-thick
platinum to the Refractaloy knife edge
blocks. Even at 1250 degrees F, the plati-
num stays bright and reflective, and the
20 millionths of an inch accuracy is now
almost as easy as it was at room tempera-
ture.
Electronic System Composed of
Black Boxes
Restoring malfunctioning aircraft elec-
tronic systems to operation aboard air-
planes of the near future may become as
simplified as stacking bricks upon a shelf,
and almost as fast.
In fact, the entire operation of return-
ing airplanes to duty after undergoing
electronic servicing could resolve into a
unique "package deal" involving a matter
of minutes to perform, according to an
announcement today by Boeing Airplane
Company.
Details of the system are described in a
patent application by three Boeing elec-
tronics engineers who spent a three-year
period of research at the company's
Wichita Division on the project. In brief,
it provides for electronic systems to be
packaged in standard sized boxes which
fit onto shelving in the aircraft fuselage in
much the manner as drawers in a file
cabinet.
The chief benefit of this system would
be full utilization of available airframe
space, a matter of increasing importance
in high-performance aircraft. The plan
also makes possible a long desired central
cooling system for electronic equipment,
and it provides for ease in maintenance,
maximum reliability, and could mean a re-
duction in gross weight for airplanes of
the future.
Packages of a given electronic system
would be interchangeable not only from
one airplane to another, but between dif-
ferent types of airplanes. An increase in
the usefulness of the equipment itself
would result from this, according to the
inventors.
With the standard size "black boxes''
in use with the shelf and drawer method
of attachment, designers no longer would
be forced to tailor electronic equipment

Emphasis in the study program at the California Institute o)
Technology will be on Systems Engineering, and at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology on Systems Engineering or Operations Research.
The Ramo-Wooldridge Fellowships have been estab-
lished in recognition of the great scarcity of scientists
and engineers who have the very special qualifications
required for work in Systems Engineering and Opera-
tions Research, and of the rapidly increasing national
need for such individuals. Recipients of these Fellow-
ships will have an opportunity to pursue a broad
course of graduate study in the fundamental mathe-
matics, physics, and engineering required for careers
in these fields, and will also have an opportunity to
associate and work with experienced engineers
and scientists.
Systems Engineering encompasses difficult advanced
design problems of the type which involve inter-
actions, compromises, and a high degree of optimiza-
tion between portions of complex complete systems.
This includes taking into account the characteristics
of human beings who must operate and otherwise
interact with the systems.
Operations Research involves the application of the
scientific method of approach to complex manage-
ment and operational problems. Important in such ap-
plication is the ability to develop mathematical models
of operational situations and to apply mathematical
tools to the solution of the problems that emerge.
The program for each Fellow covers approximately
a twelve-month period, part of which is spent at The
Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation, and the remainder at
the California Institute of Technology or the Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology working toward the
Doctor's degree, or in post-doctoral study. Fellows in
good standing may apply for renewal of the Fellow-
ship for a second year.
eligibility The general requirements for eligibil-
ity are that the candidate be an American citizen who
has completed one or more years of graduate study in
mathematics, engineering or science before July 1958.
The Fellowships will also be open to persons who have
already received a Doctor's degree and who wish to
undertake an additional year of study focused specifi-
cally on Systems Engineering or Operations Research.
AWARDS The awards for each Fellowship granted
will consist of three portions. The first will be an
educational grant disbursed through the Institute
attended of not less than $2,000, with possible upward
adjustment for candidates with family responsibilities.
The second portion will be the salary paid to the
Fellow for summer and part-time work at The Ramo-
Wooldridge Corporation. The salary will depend upon
his age and experience and amount of time worked,
but will normally be approximately $2,000. The third
portion will be a grant of $2,100 to the school to cover
tuition and research expenses.

use. This basic idea can be extended to
engineering reports, technical data sheets,
and many other forms of technical in-
formation.
From another point of view, the mod-
ern concept of systems, such as Weapons
Systems, rather than a single unit or in-
strument has so changed the engineering
approach that the engineer has been able,
and also to some extent been forced, to
pass on the burdens and responsibilities to
other engineers—those in the technical
writing field. Publications Engineering
can be considered a specialization with the
engineering profession—an engineering
specialist that relieves other engineers of
almost all work concerned with technical
literature.
Our highly developed industrial society
with its constantly increasing technologi-
cal quantities and complexities seems to
assure a continuation of the almost steady
increase of the past year. New uses,
new horizons for Publications Engineers
are being found and developed continu-
ously. The Sperry Publications Depart-
ment, for example, has almost twice the
scope of work that it had six or seven

and brochures)

Technical Advertising
Special Publications (of any type)
The duties of the Publications Engineer
can be outlined by the following chart
presentation.
Other services which the skilled Pub-
lications Engineer can perform are:
(1) assisting engineers in the prepara-
tion of technical papers for professional
societies,
(2) preparation of technical newslet-
ters and bulletins,
(3) publication of a technical maga-
zine,
(4) providing general editorial service
for technical staff, and
(5) assisting in the organization and
presentation of symposiums and demon-
strations for technical and management
personnel.
The normal concept of the Publications
Engineer is that of complete responsi-
bility for all phases of the preparation
of a publication. The Publications Engi-
neer writes and/or edits copy and direct i
the efforts of all of the supporting sen-
ices, such as illustrating, photography,
typing, printing, and so forth. Many of
the individual specialists will know more
about their individual fields than the Pub-
lications Engineer, but the Publications
Engineer is the writer, editor, and gen-
eral coordinator. An analogy can be made
to the project engineer. Such an engineer
directs his own efforts and those of pos-
sibly many other individuals and depart-
ments to produce a given product. In
effect, he does some of the work himself,
and he directs and coordinates the rest.
The Publications Engineer does much the
same, but his end product is a publication
rather than a piece of hardware.
Publication Organization
Publication setups vary considerably in
different companies aand organizations.
Some firms have a separate, central publi-
cations department responsible for most
or all of the technical publications and
literature that is put out. Other firms have
several publications departments each re-
sponsible for a separate phase of work, or
the work of an individual division of a
larger company. In other cases, individ-
uals or small groups of Publications Engi-
neers work in a laboratory with an engi-
needing group—more or less for the
group directly. In the case of professional
or trade magazines, individuals or small
groups work directly on the staff of these
publications.
It seems to work out best when the
supervising group to which the publica-
tion department reports is engineering or
technical. Also, since the habitat of a
, Publications Engineer is a publication de-
partment, a central department even of
limited scope often is better (from the
point of view of the Publications Engi-
neer) than a setup where individuals
work as a minor part of a separate proj-
ect. The Publications Department should
have a definite place in the company or-
ganization, its executive administrator re-
porting at a high level, and with its own
supervisors, budget, and facilities.
The breakdown of a more or less typi-
cal Publications Department is illustrated
in the accompanying chart. Note that in
this example all of the facilities necessary
to its complete functioning are contained
62
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


In considering employment the pros-
pective Publications Engineer should in-
vestigate thoroughly the organization and
standing of the Publication Department
or of the Publications Engineers in a
particular Company.
What About Compensation?
In many cases (the trend is increasing)
the starting salaries of Publications Engi-
neers are equal to those of development
and production engineers. This is as it
should be since Publications Engineering
is a field of specialization within the engi-
neering profession. In some cases, an
engineering student who has demon-
strated a sustained interest and activity
in the field of technical writing while in
college might command a higher salary as
a Publications Engineer than he would be
offered as a project or product engineer.
Compensation beyond the starting sal-
ary for those talented in Publications En-
gineering and employed by a firm with
the right "philosophy" and standing on
technical writing can be and quite often is
as good as any other branch of engineer-
ing—in a few cases even better.
Advancement Possibilities
The Publications Engineer should be in
a particularly good position to advance
because he combines the skills and talents
of the engineer with the ability to com-
municate knowledge and understanding.
This new profession has now achieved
sufficient depth to permit grading of
Stello Jordan, Publications Su-
pervisor in the Aeronautical
Equipment Division of Sperry
Gyroscope Company, has been
concerned with every phase of a
technical publications department
for over twelve years. After
graduating from Roosevelt Avia-
tion School and graduate work at
New York University, Jordan
did sales and accounting work
prior to entering the aviation
field. He is a member of the
Aviation Writers Association and
a Charter Member of the Inter-
national Society of Aviation
Writers.
men and writing skills. In Sperry, for
example, an engineering college graduate
would ordinarily start as an Assistant
Publications Engineer, and then advance
in grade to Publications Engineer and
Senior Publications Engineer, assuming,
of course, he had the abilities involved.
As a Senior Publications Engineer he
normally would be a lead writer or project
leader over a number of other Publica-
tions Engineers. The next step might take
him into supervision. All of the Sperry
supervisors have been advanceed into
rather than hired into their supervisory
positions. In many other organization,
while the general picture is basically the
same.
Does a decision to get into Publications
Engineering mean a "marfiage" to this
profession for life? This question is often
raised by young engineers. Of course not.
A Publications Engineer usually experi-
ences little difficulty in switching to line
engineering, assuming there are openings.
(In fact, the reverse also happens—a line
engineer switches to Publications Engi-
neering. )
Publications Engineering is sometimes
a stepping stone laterally to other jobs in
a firm or to more advanced positions in
the same or other firms. People have
moved from a Publications Department
to important positions in Engineering,
Sales, and other departments.
In general, the ability to write and
prepare technical material—to communi-
cate via the written word—is a very valu-
able asset. The engineering supervisor and
executive is called upon more and more
to prepare papers, to address groups, and
to communicate technical material via the
written word. The Publications Engineer
who has put a number of years profitably
into his work has indeed a very valuable
asset for almost any technological occu-
pation into which he may later switch.
What Are the Aptitudes Required?
An experienced Publications Engineer
is a "three-talent" individual. He has an
engineering degree or its equivalent, and
therefore a good amount of technological
knowledge. Second, he can and likes to
write. He has a good command of English
and grammar. Third, he understands pub-

riches his thinking with some notion of
the values and purposes to which man's
activities are directed. If this aim—and
we hope a fair portion is actually achieved
—is not a fitting part of an engineer's
education, then we have no answer to the
question, why not devote the English
courses to technical literature?
Nevertheless, another qualification is in
order. Because the Department feels that
in general the student's reading should be
humane, especially in view of his contact
with scientific literature in all his other
courses, it does not follow that we are op-
posed to the reading of scientific litera-
ture. Just as the Department does not ex-
clude technical writing but deems it ad-
visable to include both technical and non-
technical, so in the substance of courses,
the Department believes that it is proper
to include non-imaginative reading but
not to confine the reading to this type
any more than we would wish to confine
the writing to reporting. Accordingly, a
course in biography and a course in
scientific literature are offered at the
Group II and Group III levels. In fact, a
student could concentrate in the non-
imaginative literature by electing these
two courses following his English 11 and
12.
His richest choice, of course, lies in
imaginative literature. He can elect in
Group II the short story, modern drama,
modern novel, modern poetry, or a com-
bination of some or all of these in a
single course. In all these courses the em-
phasis rests upon introducing the stu-
dent to the nature and significance of
imaginative literature, and acquainting
him with its peculiar values. Group III
offers more advanced reading requiring
greater* maturity from the student. The
courses cover the older drama, Shakes-
peare, the older novel, American Litera-
ture, and literary masterpieces.
The Department conceives of reading,
then, in its richest sense. It means far
more than comprehension of words and
sentences, important as that is. It means
sensitive perception and penetrating in-
sight. It means understanding and being
conditioned by emotional as well as in-
tellectual communication.
The third part of the English program
is speech. This work requires neither ex-
planation nor justification. What has been
said of composition is also pertinent to
oral work. Just as composition is more
than correctness, just as reading is more
than literal understanding, so speech is
more than platform poise, clear enuncia-
tion, and the avoidance of unpleasant and
distracting mannerisms. All the elements
of structure, logic, coherence, and focus
that apply to writing apply equally to
speaking. But speech demands even more
than writing because the speaker is in
direct contact with his audience, and must
be sensitive and alert to all the psycho-
logical and social forces that will retard
or promote his communication. The stu-
dent can concentrate in speech by follow-
ing his English 21 with English 41, a
course in persuasive speaking, and English
141, devoted to argumentation and de-
bate.
What I have been describing is the
general, overall views of the English de-
partment. Much has been omitted, neces-
sarily, especially such vital elements as the
unique contributions of individual teach-
ers. The aims of the Department are fair-
ly well fixed. The methods will vary from
time to time and from course to course be-
cause of individual teachers and the con-
tinuing search for means of improving
the effectiveness of our work. For the past
two years a curriculum committee has
been examining and assessing our whole
set of courses, our aims, and our methods,
and will continue this study during the
current year. Some changes already have
been instituted as a result of this study,
more will come; what is not likely to
change is our conception of the primary
contribution that English can make to the
personal and professional life of the in-
dividual, a contribution neatly described
as follows in General Electrics Answer
to Why Study English? 'Without a rea-
sonably good command of English—as a
means of communication—and without
knowledge of what the best minds of all
time have put into print, we are not edu-
cated for happiness, apart from the job,
or for personal success in the exciting bus-
iness of making a living."

"You are probably the most sought after young men
in America today. Industries of all kinds want you.
You've got a wide choice, so which field do you choose?
"The way I look at it, the aircraft industry has the
most opportunity for you. It combines more advanced
engineering sciences than any other field ... elec-
tronics, communications, propulsion systems, hydrau-
lics and pneumatics, thermodynamics ...all these and
many others. With this variety, interesting careers can
be had either by specializing in one area or by moving
from one to another.
"Obviously, you are going to want recognition for
your work. You know that the aircraft industry pays
well... but think about this: aviation is relatively
young and its life-blood is young men with new ideas.
Numerous important advances have been made just in
the last few years. Who knows what new fields—and
new opportunities—today's research will uncover?
"So, for today's engineer, yes, 1 would say that your
best bet is the aircraft industry. Nowhere else can you
find such opportunity, such challenge ... and such
compensation and added benefits. In my estimation,
there is no place where you can put your college
training to better use'.'
In the aircraft industry there is such a variety of engi-
neering fields that a desire for virtually any one can
be satisfied. As research continues more areas will
be embraced and, as aircraft engineers pierce these bar-
riers and solve today's problems, new challenges and
opportunities arise. Northrop engineers have been
meeting these challenges successfully for years. Air-
planes such as the F-89 Scorpion, the new supersonic
twin-jet Northrop T-38 trainer, and missiles such as
the Snark SM-62 are examples of Northrop's engineer-
ing theory and capabilities.
In Northrop's new Engineering and Science Center,
your training can be applied to top priority projects
and your future will be made more secure by intensive
on-the-job training. Regular reviews reward you for
your capabilities and accomplishments, adding further
financial security. The extra benefits at Northrop, suchj
as company-paid insurance and over three weeks vaca-
tion with pay, are among the most generous in the
entire industry.

lications procedures such as format, lay-
out, typing, printing, reproduction, speci-
fications, and the like. The first is usually
acquired at college or its equivalent, the
third usually on the job. The second is a
combination of varying amounts of talent
or inherent ability, on-the-job training,
and a liking and desire for the work.
The Publications Engineer must like to
write technical material. He must be an
engineer with writing aptitude. Here a
student must be cautious. He often just
doesn't know if he can write because he
has received no real opportunity or en-
couragement during his education. There
are many examples of engineers who at
the outset felt certain that they were be-
low average in writing aptitude, yet who
developed into excellent writers for tech-
nical material.
The Publications Engineer should have
a thirst for learning—primarily broaden-
ing his background to give himself not
only knowledge but a better understand-
ing of relative values, and therefore make
better decisions. The Publications Engi-
neer must be able to get along with
people. He must exhibit a skill in facilitat-
ing cooperation and obtaining informa-
tion from different types of people. In his
work he normally comes into contact with
a variety of individauls and departments
at all levels. He must understand the
psychology of dealing with people.
The successful Publications Engineer
must have a reasonably high order of in-
telligence, ability to plan, perceptual abil-
ity, a profound interest in things (as to
what they are for, how they work), some
interest in teaching, a better than average
vocabulary, an ability to deal equally with
the theoretical and practical, a creative
ability and imagination. Not to be over-
looked is the quality of patience—patience
with the more routine phases of the work,
such as revisions to keep publications up
to date, proof-reading and overhaul pro-
cedures.
How much of each of these character-
istics is needed? Frankly, we do not yet
know. It would be only fair to point
out—in case you have already decided
that you could not measure up—that very
few Publications Engineers have all or
even most of these aptitudes in abund-
ance. The preceding is a total rather than
an actual picture.
The U. S. Government alone spends
over one quarter billion dollars a year
for the preparations of technical
articles.
What Should I Do While in College?
In college the prospective Publications
Engineer in order to prepare himself and
give himself the best "break" should:
1. Take any and all courses pertaining to
technical writing. These include techni-
cal writing courses themselves, report
writing, engineering English grammar,
and "straight" English.
2. Join the staff of a college publication,
preferably a technical or engineering
magazine, in order to gain valuable ex-
perience in writing, editing, and publi-
cation processes. Not only is this in-
valuable experience but it often clari-
fies for the student whether or not Pub-
lications Engineering is for him.
3. Attempt to write articles or to report on
technical developments—in short, get
as much writing experience as possible
in addition to the regular college work.
4. Join one of the regular technical writ-
ing professional organizations, such as
STWS or TPS,3 as a student member.
This will enable you to keep up with
what is going on in your intended field.
5. Attend any conveniently located tech-
nical writing conference, workshop, or
symposium. These are often sponsored
by a number of universities.
6. Try to obtain work during vacation
that is at least related to technical writing.
7. Consult with the college placement di-
rector to determine which companies
have a Publications Department and
potentialities for employment. Also,
talk to the company personnel repre-
sentatives that call at the campus.
8. Last, but not least, complete your engi-
neering or scientific training and get
your Engineering Degree or BS in Sci-
ence.
These items, if carried out, should not
only assure you a job but make the transi-
tion from college to industry, or else-
where, easier, if not easy.
Conclusion
For those who qualify. Publications
Engineering offers a promising career. In
addition to financial compensation con-
sistent with technological occupations,
advancement possibilities, and some of
the other items previously discussed, it
offers a chance to show creative ability.
Creative ability is the facility to conceive
of new methods of expression, to help
develop new illustrations, new techniques,
and the like. No two publications are ex-
actly alike—they are different in detail, in
originality, in writing skill. The mark of
the Publications Engineer is evident in
many ways, just as it is in other forms of
writing.
It offers personal satisfaction since as-
signments are usually of relatively short
duration, compared with that of engi-
neering, and the final results of labor are
seen at more frequent intervals. It offers a
variety of assignments and personal con-
tacts.
The future looks promising because of
the trend towards more complex equip-
ment, and the accompanying requirements
for more complete handbook and engi-
neering report coverage. The need for
engineers skilled in the art ot communica-
tion is expected to be greater in 1956 than
today, by several orders of magnitude—at
least by four.

tors, and the Technical Publishing Society.
These professional organizations exist to ad-
vance the profession and to carry on activities
to assist and benefit those who are engaged in
this field.

There are a lot of things to consider in

the company rated in its field? Is it known
as a "quality" company? Is it growing? Is it
aggressive? Is it big enough to offer you the

the point where, of necessity, it deals with
numbers instead of individuals?

Artists conception of future "black box" electronic's system.
to fit specific contours—a practice which
has resulted in numerous odd-sized elec-
tronic installations in ofttimes hard-to-
reach locations.
According to the engineering studies,
the basic individual package size measures
six inches wide, eight inches high, and
eight inches long, a volume of slightly
more than one-fourth cubic foot. These fit
onto telescoping tracks in the shelving
arrangement and have quick-disconnects
to the airplane's electrical system.
Malfunction indicators disclose where
any unit is not operating properly, and a
moderately skilled ground crewman may
obtain a replacement package, pull out the
shelf holding the inoperative unit, and
quickly make the necessary substitution.
Studies at Boeing showed that elec-
tronic "turnaround" time, the time re-
quired to return an airplane to service
after it enters layup, would amount to
three minutes for a single unit. Depend-
ing on the difficulty and the location of
the equipment, this presently can take
days.
With the electronic package size stand-
ardized, and with their installation accom-
plished in the file drawer manner, the
problem of space utilization, accessibility
and maintenance plus modernization
adaptation become more easily solved, the
engineers report.
The weight of the shelving does mean
that total weight of the equipment would
increase, according to the patent applica-
tion, but future airplane gross weight like-
ly would decrease since the engineers
would not need to increase the fuselage
to accommodate equipment.
Central cooling of the equipment
would be accomplished by circulating air
through an integral duct system in the
shelving. It also was shown that other
types of cooling could be adapted.
Air Travelers Will Ride
"Moving" Sidewalks in Dallas
Air travelers tired of trudging through
long airport corridors will have the pleas-
ure of riding to and from their planes on
a "moving sidewalk" at the new $7
million Dallas Love Field, Dallas, Tex.,
scheduled to be opened to the public late
in September.
Three "moving sidewalk" units totaling
1,435 feet in length will carry passengers
in both directions through the three cor-
ridors or "fingers" leading out from the
main terminal building to the airplane
loading gates. The operating speed at first
will be 132 feet a minute, about half aver-
age walking speed and considerably faster
than moving stairs. Passengers may walk
while they ride and thereby increase
their rate of travel. When the public be-
comes accustomed to "moving sidewalks,"
consideration will be given to increasing
their speed.
The Dallas "moving sidewalk" is the
first ever installed at an airport. It was
designed, manufactured and installed by
Hewitt-Robbins, Inc., Stamford, Conn.,
and is called the "Glide-Ride." It has
several unique features. One of these
features is that it will go around cor-
ners and may be installed in the form of a
loop so that passengers are carried in two
directions. The curving feature is not
utilized at Dallas but will be used in
other locations where the course is irregu-
lar rather than in a straight line as at
Dallas.
Passengers will stand on a rubber car-
pet fastened to individual 24-in. by 42-in.
pallets linked together by universal
couplings. The pallets are mounted on
4l^-in. diameter rubber-tired wheels
which run on a steel track. Three 30 h.p.
electric motors, located in the basement
under the terminal building, transmit
power through lugs on a sprocket chain
which engage the underside of each
pallet. The rubber carpet does not pull
any part of the load but is used only as a
cover over the pallets to give passengers
a smooth, even platform to ride on. It
is made of solid rubber and contains no
reinforcing fabric like that used in con-
ventional conveyor belts.
The shortest of the three "Glide-Ride"
units measures 218 ft. in each direction
and is installed in the north corridor. The
units in the east and west corridors are
250 ft long each way. All carpets are 42
in. wide, permitting pedestrians to ride
two abreast. The corridors are completely
enclosed and air-conditioned. The "mov-
ing sidewalks" rise on a gentle grade
from each end so that their center sections
are about 8 ft. higher than their ends.
This provides an underpass to permit
trucks and other service vehicles to drive
under the corridors.
Commenting on this new development
in transportation, Thomas Robins, Jr..
president of Hewitt-Robins, predicted
rapid growth in the use of "moving side-
walks" at airports and in shopping cen-
ters, subways, museums, railroad stations
and large manufacturing plants.

Selecting a career can be puzzling, too.
Here's how Lee Baker found the solution
to his career problem—with IBM:
Despite his impending Service hitch, Lee
was hired by IBM in 1953. As a Technical
Engineer, he entered the General Manu-
facturing Education Program, a 10-month
course with rotating assignments in all
phases of the work: manufacturing, pur-
chasing, production. Then came two years
in Korea. Now back at IBM, Lee has been
promoted to Production Control Engineer,
responsible for designing systems to insure
a smooth flow of work through the IBM
electronic computer plant. "It takes creative
engineering ability to design these systems,"
says Lee, "and administrative ability to 'sell'
a system to higher management'*
There are many excellent opportunities for
well-qualified engineers, physicists and
mathematicians in IBM Research, Develop-
ment and Manufacturing Engineering. Why
not ask your College Placement Director
when IBM will next interview on your
campus? Or, for information about how
your degree will fit you for an IBM career,

WRITING
(Continued from page 54)
in his organization. Tied together in one
neat and prosaic square package, were
all the engineering writers, organized in
an assembly-line set-up that would have
made Henry Ford weep with shame. The
chart of organization was so scientifically
efficient that each writer was accounted
for down to the last dangling participle.
What this set-up lacked in allowing for
individual creativeness it made up for by
killing the individual's incentive.
Fortunately, all industrial opportunities
for technical writers are not so coldly effi-
cient as the preceeding example. Many
firms are genuinely interested in making
the technical writer an indigenous part of
the engineering team, thereby having the
writer become as much a literary scientist
as the engineer is a technical scientist.
The fact that technical writing in in-
dustry takes on so many guises makes
searching for the right job anything but a
hit-or-miss process. The prospective writer
must be constantly alert to the possibilities
open to him, and must thoroughly survey
the field for the right opening. He must
first find out the importance given to
technical writing within the particular
firm in question, and then take inventory
regarding the type of work done and the
atmosphere in which the writers are al-
lowed to produce their publications. In
the final analysis, the hopeful technical
writer must evaluate the given position in
the light of his own abilities and aspira-
tions.
Taken in its entirety, technical writing
offers a wealth of possibilities for the
engineer with a flair for writing. From the
longer publications such as text books and
technical magazines, technical writers are
called upon to produce instruction books,
training manuals, technical reports, parts
manuals, and scientific articles. The writer
must have a working knowledge of the
advantages of the many types of repro-
duction processes, as well as the various
technical fields about which he is writing.
He must be the proverbial jack-of-all
trades.
The Future for Technical Writers
Several factors which are of importance
in attempting to predict the future for
technical writing all look favorable to-
ward increasing opportunity for this new
profession. First, the complexity of equip-
ment and systems certainly will continue
to increase—automation and instrumenta-
tion go hand-in-hand, and with the de-
velopment of automation always comes
increased technical complexity. Secondly,
with such an increased complexity there
follows the condition that equipment will
be much more costly, and must be rapoir?
ed rather than replaced,. Third, the in-
creasing complexity and specialization of
science and engineering will eventually
lead to more isolationism of the various
fields within it, and more and more
liaison will be needed for adequate com-
munication. Finally, if the calibre of engi-
neering graduates coming into the writing
field is maintained or elevated, there will
be a broadening in the scope of their
work since they themselves will develop
opportunities for using their special skill
to supplement the work of other engi-
neers.
Technical writers have already made
great strides in a very important responsi-
bility to any new profession—that of de-
veloping and broadening particular skills
and offering them to others. To help
carry out that responsibility, a new group
in this field was formed in April, 1953:
The Association of Technical Writers and
Editors. As stated in its Constitution, the
following are the objectives of the Asso-
ciation:
to advance the profession through the
exchange of ideas, knowledge, philos-
ophy, and techniques;
establishment of professional college
and university curricula for the train-
ing of technical writers aand editors;
encouragement of continued education,
training, and advancement of the mem-
bership;
development of a literature for the pro-
fession;
recognition of professional ethics.
Whether or not technical writing as a
profession, stands by itself or is sucked
into the vortex of the "big picture" de-
pends upon the individual writer. Pros-
pects for a highly respected and gratifying
future for the engineering writer lie be-
fore him like the Promised Land. But the
future will also depend upon the efforts
which these engineering writers make to
find new areas of service to the engi-
neering profession.
Why Vought Projects
Bring Out The Best
In An Engineer
At Vought, the engineer doesn't often
forget past assignments. Like all big
events, they leave vivid memories.
And it's no wonder
For here the engineer contributes to
history-making projects — among
them the record-breaking Crusader
fighter; the Regulus II missile, chosen
to arm our newest nuclear subs; and
the new fast-developing 1,500-plus-
mph fighter, details of which are still
classified.
The Vought engineer watches such
weapons take shape. He supervises
critical tests, and he introduces the
weapons to the men with whom they
will serve.
Engineers with many specialties share
these experiences. Today, for exam-
ple, Vought is at work on important
projects involving:
electronics design and manufacture
inertial navigation
investigation of advanced propulsion
methods
Mach 5 configurations
Vought's excellent R&amp;D facilities
help the engineer through unexplored
areas. And by teaming up with other
specialists against mutual challenges,
the Vought engineer learns new fields
while advancing in his own.

"Pavements" by F. M. Danlap, '83, de-
scribed and compared the three street-sur-
facing methods in use at the time: asphalt,
stone, and wood. Asphalt was preferred
to stone or wood because its continuity
and inertness made it more sanitary in
those days of equine transportation. Stone
ranked highest in durability, wood lowest,
needing replacement every four or five
years. Costs were, per square yard: cedar,
$1.35 to $1.40; asphalt, $3.25 to $3.50;
and granite block, $4.15 to $4.50.
"Electric Railways" by F. C. Wagner
announced that an experimental electric
railway was to be built in Detroit that
summer, as a possible replacement for
horsecars. The author saw elevated lines
in large cities as the target for electrifica-
tion, in order to obviate the danger from
trolley wiring. The cost of such a line in
Berlin was $54,000 per mile.

"The Detroit River Tunnel" by Ben-
jamin Douglas, '82, gave a brief descrip-
tion of a 7,960 foot tunnel planned by
the Michigan Central Railroad. This tun-
nel was to replace carferries and to com-
pete with the Grand Trunk Railway which
opened a bore at Port Huron in 1890.
"A Civil Engineer's Opportunities" by
George Y. Wisner, '65, outlined future
prospects for civil engineering grads.
Hydraulic engineering was seen as the
broadest field open to the civil engineer at
the time. The Panama Canal was cited as
a boon to the profession. A twenty-foot
waterway projected from Georgian Bay
to the St. Lawrence river is reminiscent of
today's seaway. As a word of warning,
the author notes that only half of the
freshman class was likely to graduate
"with records that will warrant them tak-
ing up the practice of engineering as their
life work." Sound familiar?
25 Years Ago
"The Streamlining of Auto Bodies" by
William B. Seens, '34, theorized on the
future of auto body streamlining. "An
analysis . . . has revealed that it would
require a power increase of 8009c to ob-
tain a speed increase of 100^, by extra-
polation of curves he (Prof. W. E. Lay]
has estimated that this speed (about 120
MPH) will be reached by 1950. . ."
A verbal battle was waged from mouth
to mouth on the humor pages between
poetically-minded males and the "Slide
Rule Sadies" who had begun to enroll in
the College of Engineering—but the men
got the last word:
"The ladies in the Engine school
Are known to be quite very cool
Perhaps they realize it ain't
Adaptable to skirts and paint.
And then again perhaps they know
The Engineers are not so slow
And they don't trust themselves with men
Who never heard of the word "when."
They fuss with slide-rules, calc and trig
And often take a nasty dig
At men they try to imitate
Yet make one think they really hate.

I AM AN ENGINEER. In my profession I take pride, but without vain-
glory; to it I owe solemn obligations that I am eager to fulfill.
As an Engineer, I will participate in none but honest enterprise. To
him that has engaged my services, as employer or client, I will give the ut-
most of performance and fidelity.
When needed, my skill and knowledge shall be given without reser-
vation for the public good. From special capacity springs the obligation to
use it well in the service of humanity; and I accept the challenge that this
implies.
Jealous of the high repute of my calling, I will strive to protect the
interests and the good name of any engineer that I know to be deserving;
but I will not shrink, should duty dictate from disclosing the truth regard-
ing anyone that, by unscrupulous act, has shown himself worthy of the
profession.
Since the Age of Stone, human progress has been conditioned by the
genius of my profesional forbears. By them have been rendered usable to
mankind Nature's vast resources of material and energy. By them have
been visualized and turned to practical account the principles of science and
the revelations of technology. Except for this heritage of accumulated ex-
perience, my efforts would be feeble. I dedicate myself to the dissemina-

Recently, while interviewing a west coast aircraft company, I was somewhat surprised to hear the
interviewer mention the existance of an "Engineers and Architects Association" which he stated was
recognized by the company as the official bargaining agent of the company's engineers. He hurriedly
added that membership was not prerequisite for employment and that many of the engineers were not
members, undoubtedly in an attempt to dispel any fears I might have had about a closed shop or the
presence of a strong union of engineers.
As usual after the interview I began to "rehash" what had transpired. Recalling the mention of
the Engineers and Architects Association I began to wonder whether this was the type of organization
required to give engineering professional recognition, and if this wasn't, what would be required of
an organization which would accomplish this end, and how close are we to achieving it?
After only a few minutes of thought I was convinced that the Engineers and Architects Association
was not the required organization. Instead it was undermining the professional cause, for in acting as a
collective bargaining agent it placed itself and its members on the trade union level. Quite apparently
I had to look elsewhere to find the required organizational characteristics.
The American Medical Association appeared to be the logical choice. Here was an organization
which bound together and upheld the professional standards of one of the most highly regarded
professional groups in the world, doctors. After some study I found what I considered its outstanding
traits.
First of all is its organizational strength. The national organization is composed of a well knit
system of state and local chapters. The amount of power and influence wielded by the organization is
equal to or greater than that of any trade union. If a member is ejected from the local and national
organizations and suffers from the accompanying boycott, he has received "the kiss of death" as far as his
professional practice is concerned.
A second characteristic is its high membership requirements. To qualify for membership one
must have graduated from an accredited medical school and have passed the state board examination.
Experience is not allowed to be substituted for educational background, nor is substandard schooling
tolerated.
Finally the association performs a number of services for its members, such as publication of tech-
nical journals, conducting research, and holding national and local meetings at which papers written on
recent technological advances are presented. In general it can be stated that the AMA attempts to give
its members the advantages of all the new developments in the medical field.
Not satisfied with the results of examining just one professional organization, I thought I would
look into the bar associations. Somewhat to my surprise the same three elements persisted. To be ejected
from the bar association generally means the end of the road for a lawyer. For admission to the bar
association one must have passed the state bar examination, and the number of legal publications and
meetings are practically innumerable.
Armed with these conclusions I returned to the engineering scene. From all appearances much
organizational work must be done in order to have any of the existing societies take on the first two
traits. This movement would be opposed by many self-taught and psuedo engineers, so that to
accomplish this a truly united effort would be required by all graduate engineers.
The third characteristic already exists in the engineering field. Most of the present societies do more
than an adequate job of keeping their members up to date in their particular field.
With the appearance of organizations such as this Engineers and Architects Association, and the
inadequacy of the present societies in comparison to the successful professional societies, it seems
as though either some positive steps must be taken in the professional organization direction or soon we
will all be going to work with union badges clipped on our slide rule cases.

Pictured above is our new Research and Development Center now
under construction in Wilmington, Massachusetts. Scheduled for
completion in early 1958, this ultramodern laboratory will house
the scientific and technical staff of the Avco Research and Advanced
Development Division.
A SCIENTIST-ENGINEEK
SPEAKS ABOUT AVCO
More AND MORE it is being appreciated that no sharp border-
line between science and engineering should exist. These
two fields must strongly overlap to bring into being the fullest
creativity of both.
To span the gap between science and engineering is one of the
big problems—it is one which no laboratory can ignore. In this
nc -man's-land there are engineers who are physicists and physi-
cists who are engineers. Avco is encouraging a staff of such men,
men who are highly trained in the sciences but who realize that
the ultimate goal is to apply this knowledge in ways that will
enable mankind to live better in a better world of tomorrow.
Industrial research must rest on the foundation provided by the
creative basic scientist. Yet its end product—new commercial
items, new defense systems and new techniques—comes into
being only through the insight and skill of the creative engineer.
Avco's newest division has a climate of creativity, coupled with
long-range corporate goals. In this atmosphere creative and far-
sighted professional men, whether scientist, engineer or any one
of the infinite number of combinations thereof, will find rewarding
work at the Research and Advanced Development Division
of Avco.
Avco's new research division now offers unusual and excit-
ing career opportunities for exceptionally qualified and
forward-looking scientists and engineers in such fields as:
Science:
Aerodynamics • Electronic* • Mathematics • Metallurgy
Physical Chemistry • Physics • Thermodynamics
Engineering:
Aeronautical • Applied Mechanics • Chemical • Electrical
Heat Transfer • Mechanical • Reliability • Flight Test

The study of the mechanics of fluids
is by no means a new one. History
dates it back to Archimedes and probably
then some. Yet there are many essentially
simple observations which have never
been explained. Transient phenomena in
physical systems are usually more difficult
to predict theoretically then steady-state
phenomena, especially when the funda-
mental differential equations which des-
cribe the system are non-linear.
Shock Waves and the Tube
Fluid dynamics consists of imposing
problems which involve boundary layers,
heat flow, skin friction, turbulence, high
temperature chemical kinetics and high
temperature gas physics. There are a
number of ways of creating shock waves
to study their characteristics. A sudden
release of energy from a point source
such as from a spark, or the detonation
of an explosive are common methods of
generating a spherical shock in the sur-
rounding atmosphere. A bullet or shell
in supersonic flight sets up a bow wave
or shock which diffuses outward from
the line of motion. Shocks are associated
with all types of jets or nozzles in which
stream velocities exceed the speed of
sound.
The two most common means of creat-
ing shock waves and other flow condi-
tions for laboratory study are the wind
tunnel and the shock tube. However, the
former is used primarily for steady-state
observations while the shock tube is
primarily important in the study of
transient phenomena.
A Bit of History
The shock tube was originally devised
by Vieille in 1899 when it was used in
connection with experiments in detona-
tion. Widespread interest, however, was
not stimulated until 1937, when the
Englishmen Payman and Shepherd con-
ducted a set of experiments in which
copper-foil diaphragms were used to
sustain the high pressure in the com-
pression chamber of their tube. Of a
somewhat later date, Bleakney and his
co-workers have been instrumental in
establishing the shock tube as a useful
tool for the study of gasdynamics
phenomena. Shock tube research here at
the University of Michigan was begun in
1947 under the direction of Professors
Otto LaPorte and Lincoln G. Smith. In
fact, the original shock tube was the one
used by Dr. Smith at Princeton Univer-
sity for the study of regular and Mach
reflections of shock waves.
What Is It?
Essentially, then, what is a shock tube,
and how does it operate? Basically, it
is a long pipe which might vary from
10 to 100 feet in length, depending upon
its application. The pipe is divided into
two parts, the low-pressure and the high-
pressure chambers, respectively, and
when the experiment is ready to proceed,
the diaphragm dividing the two regions
is destroyed. Driver gas in the high-
pressure chamber than explosively rushes
into the low-pressure chamber which is
filled with any particular gas we wish to
study. Different gases behave in different
ways, and any one might be chosen to
simulate certain conditions. If one is
interested in producing a high Mach
number in the flow behind the shock
wave, one of the complex gases is used.
For example, in sulfurhexafluoride a
Mach number of about 4 can be reached,

while the limit for argon is only about
1.3. On the other hand, if one is inter-
ested in obtaining a flow with high
temperature and luminosity, one of the
heavier rare gases is used; in xenon, it
is possible to reach 35,000° F in the
flow region behind a reflected shock.
It is interesting to realize that these
temperatures are high enough to compare
with those of star atmospheres, so that
concepts and theories used in astrophys-
ics must be employed in the interpreta-
tion of these results. The explosive action
of the driver gas forces the gas in the
low-pressure chamber ahead of it. Under
these conditions, the gas in the low pres-
sure chamber does not have sufficient
time to get out of the way in the con-
ventional manner, and a shock wave
results.
This wave speeds down the tube,
ahead of the onrushing driver gas, com-
pressing and accelerating the gas in the
low-pressure tube. If high enough pres-
sures are used in the driver gas, an ex-
tremely strong shock wave can be gen-
erated. (Speeds of 18000 mph have al-
ready been obtained.) If the tube can be
made long enough (Avco Manufactur-
ing Corporation has built a monster
which measures 100 feet), a pocket of
gas which increases in size with the
length of the shock tube develops ahead
of the rushing driver gas. This pocket
is called an "interface".
Temperatures far in excess of those
needed for hypersonic flight testing may
be generated in this interface. Witness
the 35000° F temperature mentioned
earlier. The temperature, pressure, and
velocity of the gases in the shock tube
may be known to considerable accuracy.
This point is very important in precise
physical measurement. However, the gas
is still not useful for hypersonic testing,
for while it is very hot, its Mach number
is incorrect. Here gas is accelerated to
extreme temperatures, as well as accel-
erated to high velocity. Therefore, its
Mach number still remains a relatively
small value, since the speed of sound
increases with increasing temperature. For
example, the maximum flow Mach num-
ber which can be obtained in this region
in an ideal diatomic gas is 1.89, but in
air the Mach number can be as high
as 3 because of the real gas effects.
Consequently, the conventional shock tube
is useful for aerodynamic investigations
when it is not necessary to simulate the
flight Mach number. To conquer this
difficulty, a trick has been borrowed from
the conventional wind tunnel by insert-
ing an expanding nozzle at the end of
the shock tube which allows the gas to
expand to the proper Mach number.
Since the gas has been pre-heated, the
cooling due to this expansion brings the
test section temperatures down to the
desired level as the gas accelerates. Thus
the conditions in the tube accurately
simulate those of free hypersonic flight
in the upper atmosphere. Calculations
have shown that a shock tube of this
design could simulate hypersonic flight
up to Mach 25.
At a flight Mach number of approxi-
mately 16, the equilibrium stagnation
temperature at the nose of an insulated
blunt body is approximately 6000° F in
air at a density of about 60,000 feet.
At this temperature, the thermal energy
of the air is sufficient to excite the higher
rotational and vibrational states of the
diatomic molecules, produce disassocia-
tion and ionization, and cause chemical
reactions such as the formation of nitric
oxide. New problems are consequently
introduced since, in this temperature
range, the air may be considered a
chemically active fluid. For example, the
convective heat transfer—the amount ot
heat transferred through the boundary
layer to a body—may depend to a large
extent upon the dissociation and recom-
bination inside and outside of the boun-

been extremely useful in the past and
offer a promising future as regards the
design of today's ballastic missile and
tomorrow's spaceship. Actually, however,
aerodynamics testing is only a small part
of shock tube research being performed
in this country.
Photography and the Shock Wave
An extremely interesting phase of
shock tube testing is the method of
photography employed. Immediately fol-
lowing the breaking of the diaphragm,
a pressure wave travels into the ex-
pansion chamber. After travelling a short
distance, this pressure wave becomes a
shock wave with an almost plane front,
moving with nearly constant velocity.
The velocity of the shock front is de-
termined by measuring the time between
its arrival at two stations along the tube,
which are a known distance apart. At
each of these stations a light source and
a photo-multiplier tube are so arranged
that the arrival of the shock front causes
a brief pulse of light to fall upon the
cathode of the photo-tube. The resulting
voltage impulses are fed to an electronic
timer which records the time interval
between them. After the shock front
passes the second of the stations, which
will be referred to as light screens, it
passes between two circular windows in
the sides of the tube through which the
spark-shadowgrams are taken. When it is
desired to photograph the flow behind
the shock wave, the first light screen is
not used, and the time is arranged to
measure the interval between the arrival

this way, the "age" of the flow pattern
registered on the plate can be determined,
even though the shock front has passed
beyond the window.
In addition to starting the timer, the
voltage pulse from the second light
screen starts a variable-delay circuit,
which fires, or triggers the spark after
a predetermined time. The spark is an
air gap through which a capacitor can
be made to discharge by the triggering
action of the delay circuit. The spark
source is placed at the focal point of a
large lens whose axis passes through the
centers of the two circular windows, so
that when the spark is advanced, a burst
of nearly parallel light passes through
the test section, and falls on a photo-

PRESTRESSED CONCRETE
Because concrete construction members may be sub-
jected to forces before installation, performance under
actual application is improved at a reduction in costs.
The increasing construction rate, both
in buildings and bridges, has taxed
the capacity of steel mills to produce the
needed structural members. The develop-
ment and the use of prestressed concrete
members have been necessitated by both
the shortage of structural steel and by
inherent advantages in using concrete that
has been prestressed before application.
This newly recognized material is the
basis for a new and rapidly expanding
industry which may open a new era in
construction.
The secret of these new structural
members lies not so much in the com-
position of the concrete as in the process
by which they are prepared for use.
Prestressed concrete is rapidly becom-
ing a standard construction material of
bridge and building contractors all over
the United States because it can be mass
produced and erected without falsework,
can withstand heavier loads, requires less
maintenance, and, in short, is more
economical.
Today there are 150 prestressing cast-
ing yards in the country, compared to
none only a few years ago. They range
from one bed to eight beds, including
cranes and concrete plants. Many are
owned by contractors who operate them
as a separate branch of their firms.
What is Prestressed Concrete?
In bridges and buildings, when force
is applied to the top of a beam, this
beam undergoes compression on the
side facing the force and tension on the
opposite side (Fig. 1). Prestressed tensile
forces are counteracted.
Imagine that you have a pile of poker
chips between two fingers. If someone
were to hit the side of the stack while
you were holding them loosely, they
would fly apart. But if you were to
squeez them together with your fingers,
the same blow would have little effect
on the pile. This is the principle behind
prestressed concrete.
The simplest method of prestressing
is to compress the member after it is in
position (Fig. 1), but this requires
abutments capable of withstanding the
force of compression. Usually a member
is placed under stress before it is built
into the structure by one of two methods.
The first method is pre-tensioning, in
which steel elements are stressed before
the concrete hardens. The second is post-
tensioning, in which stress is applied
after the concrete hardens. In both cases,
the preliminary force system is arranged
so that desired final force is obtained.
Pre-tensioning is shown in figure 2
above. In this process pots are embedded
in concrete supports at opposite ends of
the mold, and high tension cables are
stretched between them by means of
jacks. The concrete is poured around
these cables, and, after the concrete
hardens, the cables are cut so that the
member absorbs the compressive force.
This method is used primarily by com-
mercial fabricators, the only disadvantage
here being that a large pre-tensioned
member cannot be easily transported
from the casting bed to a distant con-
struction site.
Post-tensioning differs from pre-ten-
sioning in that stress is applied after
the concrete member has been formed
(Fig. 3). Concrete is first poured around
rubes running through the mold and
then cured. Cables are then run through
the holes formed by the tubes, anchored
and stressed, and finally grouted—that
is, a fluid cement paste is pumped into
the cable openings. This process is pref-
erable where long span members are
being used, or when short spans must
have tensioning done at the construction
site. The first project using this type of
member in this country was the Walnut
Lane Bridge built in Philadelphia in
1950.
The casting beds used in prestressing
do not differ greatly from those used for
conventional concrete members. The only
major pieces of equipment necessary for
the production of prestressed members,
other than cranes and handling equip-
ment, are jacks and cables.
The jacks must be powerful enough
to handle the largest anticipated loads,
but portable enough to be shifted to
adjacent beds. They must be able to
detension safely and uniformly.
The cables must be of very high
strength, and extreme care must be ex-
ercised in tensioning and detensioning.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Bartlesville High School, Max W. Legatski is working toward a
B.S. degree in Chemical Engineering. This is Max's freshman
year, and his first article as a tryout on the Technic writing staff.
His interests other than engineering follow along lines of
sports. Besides having an active interest in hunting and fishing,
he was sports editor of his school yearbook during his senior
year. From January to Augut of 1957 he worked at the pilot
plant branch in the research and development department of Phil-
lips Petroleum Company, Bartlesville, Oklahoma.
Testing a prestressed concrete beam in the structural materials laboratory.
The stressing forces used, sometimes as
much as 1,000,000 pounds, are capable
of snapping ordinary cables like huge
rubber bands.
What are the Advantages of
Prestressed Concrete?
Prestressed concrete fully utilizes, com-
bines, and enhances the inherent char-
acteristics of the two foremost construc-
tion materials—the compression strength
of concrete with the high tensile strength
of stress-relieved cold drawn steel wire
and strand.
Basic Economy—Steel for prestressing
is six times as strong as steel for con-
ventional structures, but only three times
as expensive. Concrete for prestressing
is twice as strong, yet- the additional cost
amounts to only ten or twenty per cent.
It consumes less steel and concrete, giv-
ing greater structural strength more eco-
nomically.
Structural Balance — The stresses and
strains are balanced in a prestressed
member, therefore deflections are under
definite control. Cracks, otherwise un-
avoidable, are eliminated.
Design Economy — Prestressing makes
possible thinner sections, lower depth-
to-span ratios, and reduction in weight,
which yields savings in the supporting
members.
Prestressing is pretesting—The greatest
forces applied to the elements of a
member are applied before the member
is built into a structure, therefore the
member can be expected to stand up
under severe punishment.
Stock Pile Availability — Stock piles
allow strict schedules to be kept, thereby
allowing a greater utilization of labor.
Prestressed concrete is competing with
structural steel on the basis of both cost
and availability.
Speeds Up Construction—Prestressed
members can be erected like clockwork,
with no delay for erection and fabrication.
As an example of this, two bridges were
begun north of Ann Arbor, Michigan,
in October of 1956. The first, scheduled
to be made of prestressed concrete, had
the deck finished by the following spring.
The second, scheduled to be built with
conventional reinforced concrete, has not
been completed at this writing, more
than a year later.

X" CHASSIS
A comprehensive and clear discussion of an auto de-
sign feature that is finding greater applications and
advantages in each succeeding year's models.
Design a new chassis that can be
produced cheaper than the present
one — this is what the automotive in-
dustry is trying to do by designing an
"X" chassis. What the public wants is
a hardtop convertible, and the present
convertible requires an "X" member for
torsional strength.
A chassis can be compared to a beam
that supports the engine, the body, and
all other components that the body carries.
The present chassis has two box-section
rails tied together with cross-members
which form the chassis, while two "U"
channels welded together form the box-
section. The "X" shape chassis is nothing
new because an "X" member is welded
to the convertible chassis for torsional
strength; however, the new chassis is
different because the "X" member is
formed by bending the two rails inward
along the drive-shaft, thereby eliminating
the added "X" member. Moving the
rails inward affects certain areas of the
car, such as the tunnel section, bod)
mounts, cross-members, exhaust routing,
and the strength of the chassis; however,
more portions of the car could be affected
by the movement of the rails, but they
are not obvious until the problem is laid
out on a drawing plate.
Body Mounts and Tunnel Section
Affected
The tunnel section increases in size,
when the rails are moved inward, because
the rails are not permitted to touch
directly, due to the drive-shaft movement.
Because the public demands a soft ride
from their vehicles, the differential is
designed to move 4" up in jounce and
6" down in rebound for a total vertical
movement of 10", which also moves the
drive-shaft up and down in an arc move-
ment. For instance, one rear wheel could
go up and the other rear wheel could
go down, which could be compared to a
compass scribing an arc because the axle
is a rigid member; the drive-shaft, con-
nected to the differential, moves through
the scribed arc, as the wheels move in
jounce and rebound, causing the drive-
shaft to move in a horizontal and vertical
path at the same time. The floor-pan's
going over both the drive-shaft and rails
results in a larger tunnel, cutting down
the passenger's footroom inside the car.

neer. He hails originally from Warren City, Michigan, but has

comfort to the passeengers, and the large
runnel spoils the appearance of the car
interior.
The body mounts on the present car
are put on the rail and keep the body
from leaving the chassis, either when
starting or stopping. The rail, being on
the outside and away from the centerline
of the car, adds a stabilizing effect; for in-
stance, when a person gets in on one
side of the car, the other side does not
deflect upward. Looking at the problem
through an engineer's eyes, the person
getting into the car represents a load
on a cantilever beam, while the beam
is the floor-pan and the fixed end the
place where the floor is tied to the "X"
chassis in the center of the car. From
engineering mechanics it is known that
a cantilever beam deflects more than a
beam fixed at both ends for the same
load and length. It can be shown in the
case of the "X" chassis that the beam
length is shorter in comparison to the
present chassis, but the load is placed
on the unfixed end causing maximum
deflection. In the case of the present
chassis, the rails are outward from the
center of the car, and the beam length
is increased, but the load is placed closer
to the fixed end resulting in a minimum
deflection. To remedy the problem the
floor-pan must be stressed by cold work-
ing and by adding stringers to the pan.
Long brackets fixed to the chassis and
resembling a yoke must extend to the
outside of the floor-pan for placing body-
mounts. The brackets stabilize the body
and also to transmit some of the load to
the chassis from the body.
Cross-members are needed to tie
the two rails together. Because the rails
are closer together at the one section
where the chassis moves inward, the
cross-members there can be shorter in
length, resulting in lighter and cheaper
cross-members. Again using engineering
mechanics for the analysis, it is known
that the movement increases with increas-
ing length for a constant load. Due to the
shortening of the cross-member, the
movement is reduced, thereby reducing
the flexure stress and allowing the mem-
ber to be lighter in gage. The cost lowers
due to the reduced weight and the easier
formation of lighter gage metal.
Better Use Made of Mufflers
Moving the rails inward allows a full
length muffler to be placed under the
floor-board instead of the present two
mufflers to a bank, and also allows a
more direct routing of the exhaust pipe
BODY MOUAJT 8&amp;)C/r£7S
and the cost of the exhaust system. For
instance, the 1957 chassis has 4 mufflers,
because there is not room enough for a
full length muffler due to the chasses
moving outward instead of inward after
passing hhe engine. The muffler can now
be moved forward toward the engine
compartment, thereby giving the muffler
the length necessary for usage of only one
muffler to a bank.
The strength of the chassis has to be
the rails inward and then outward in
order to reduce stress concentration and
to improve the ease of manufacturing
at those joints.
Moving the rails inward allows the
overall height to be reduced, but at the
expense of a larger tunnel. The question
arises as to what the public wants in the
way of a car. A large tunnel could be
fashionable in a sports model. For in-
stance, the tunnel could be flattened and

improved where the rails move inward,
which can be accomplished by gradually
changing the section at this portion from
a box-section to an oval section and also
by increasing the depth of the section. The
deep oval section improves the torsional
and bending strength due to increased
section modulus. A caping plate is
also reequired on the top and bottom
of the chassis, but only at t he in-
ward portion to increase the torsional
and bending strength. Smaller gage
metal can be used for the chassis by
moving the rails inward in the shape of
the "X" and by using larger sections.
Large radii are required when bending

the top used as a stand for mounting
ash-trays, radio, etc. A majority of the
cars produced today are either con-
vertibles or hardtop convertibles and re-
quire the added "X" member for tor-
sional strength. By redesigning the rails
into an "X" member, the weight (150
lbs. of the "X" member could be also
removed from the weight of the car.
This is a large saving in material per car
and one of the big reasons why most of
the companies are investigating the poscsi-
bilities of changing the present chassis.
At the present time Cadillac is the only
car on the market with an "X" chassis.

A counterpart of human intelligence.
Decisions, both grave and trifling,
help make life interesting, enjoy-
able, and worthwhile. For if making
decisions is striped from many of our
activities, life becomes barren, dull,
routine, or uninteresting, even machine-
like. Since decisions play an important
role in human life, it behooves us to
understand their effect. Thus, what we
need is an examination of decision-mak-
ing so that we can determine what factor
about it is necessary to lend interest to
our activities.
To learn more about decisions and
what makes them interesting, social
scientists have enlisted the aid of mathe-
matical game theory. However, the theory
is so highly complex that it cannot be
comprehensively treated in a single
article. Hence, we will neglect the
mathematical details and will concern
ourselves with the qualitative features
and the results of the argument.
Clarifying the Terminology
Although we will not employ math-
ematical symbols and equations, we
must be mathematically precise in
our use of terminology. It is worth-
while, therefore, at this point to care-
fully define the familiar words which
will be used in very restricted connota-
tions.1 What is ordinarily regarded as a
chain of decisions, one leading to another
in time, is now regarded as a single
decision. Rational behavior refers to
something more than just logical be-
1 The definitions are summarized from: John
von Neuman and Oskar Morgenstern, Theory
of Games and Economic Behavior, Princeton
Univ. Press, 1953; and L. J. Savage, Founda-
tions of Statistics, John Wiley and Sons, 1954.
havior, for it involves subjective value
judgments. Reasoning, as used in this
paper, is also associated with logic, but
it is more an objective attempt to extra-
polate the logic rather than to be the
logic itself. Any of several permissible
alternatives are termed moves, while the
alternative actually selected is termed the
choice. An inadmissible move is an
alternative which is eliminated from
further consideration because of the
rational behavior on the part of another
in a situation of strategic uncertainty.
An uncertainty is an unpredictable event.
Having completed the preliminaries,
we can proceed to an examination of
each of the components of decision-
making, always remembering that our
final objective is to discover from our
observations what it is about the making
of decisions which gives interest to the
activities with which they are concerned.
Three Types of Decisions
Basically, there are three varieties of
decisions. The simplest type is the "no-
risk" decision, in which the outcomes
for each move, including the choice, are
known prior to the making of the de-
cision. The next, the "pure-chance"
decision, is one in which the outcomes
are not known, but are fixed beyond all
control. The most complex are those for
which the outcomes are not fixed, but
are partially within the control of another
party; these situations are called "strategic
uncertainties."
In the "no risk" case, the first elements
of decision-making arises: the making
of a rational decision. For example, con-
sider a wealthy man with only twenty
cents in his pocket who is a long distance
from home to which he plans to return
by bus which costs twenty cents. Now.
he is offered a bet whereby a coin is
tossed. If it lands 'heads," he will get
a dollar; but if it lands "tails," he must
pay the bettor his twenty cents. At first
glance, one would be tempted to describe
this as a "pure chance" situation. But
this would not be correct, for the wealthy
man would certainly refuse the bet on
the basis of the following value judg-
ment. If he loses, he must walk home,
which is at least an inconvenience; and
if he wins, he gains only a dollar which
means very little to him. Thus, this mm
does not even progress to the point ot
taking a chance, but rather refuses the
bet, as an act of rational behavior.2 This
same type of rational behavior permeates
all decision-making, from the very simple
to the most complex, including instances
of "pure chance" and of "strategic un-
certainty."
Occasions of "pure chance" require
reasoning to delineate the various de-
cisions so that rational behavior can then
be determined. Consider the possibilities
available when the weather forecast is
"possible rain" on the day you plan to
go to the ballgame. One move is to stay
home. Another is to go, but to take
raincoats and umbrellas. And a third is
to go with no protection from the rain.
Rational behavior is, of course, deter-
mined when the disappointment of not
going after making the original plans
is weighed against going without rain
protection, or going but having the in-
convenience of carrying protection if it
is not needed. That is, when the

described situation of "pure chance"
prevails, going with rain protection is
considered rational behavior, but it
should be noted that rational behavior
can be determined only after reasoning
was applied to extend the facts regarding
the "pure chance" into posible moves.
Another rather commonplace example
of preceding the determination of ra-
tional behavior by reasoning in situations
of "pure chance" is taken from the
kitchen. Suppose you wish to make a
batch of cookies. When you have already
added about half of the ingredients, you
must add an egg—but only a fresh egg.
« a spoiled egg is added not only is the
egg of no use, but also all of the
ingredients already mixed are rendered
worthless. Reasoning shows the following
possible moves: the egg may be thrown
out before it's opened. Now, while this
's somewhat absurd, it is a possible move
and it has definite outcomes. If the egg
■s good, one egg is wasted and the batch
°« cookies is not finished. But, if, on the
other hand, the egg is spoiled, the batch
°f cookies is saved. The second move
is to break the egg directly into the
batch of cookies. If the egg is good, a
completed batch of cookies results; and
if the egg is spoiled, all is lost. A third
move is to break the egg into a saucer
for examination before it is added to the
ingredients. If it is good, a batch of
cookies results, and there is a saucer to
wash; and if the egg is bad, the batch
is saved, and there is a sauceer to wash.
After the above reasoning has been
made, you can then determine rational
behavior, and unless you are extremely
adverse to washing saucers, you will
probably choose the last move to carry
out.
In addition to reasoning and rational
behavior, "strategic uncertainty," the
third type of situation which requires
decisions, also involves the concept of
inadmissibility. Thus, certain alternatives
are automatically removed from further
consideration on the grounds that reason-
ing followed by rational behavior of
other persons involved will not allow
them to make these alternatives available.
Hence, the end result is a situation of
"pure chance." Illustrations of "strategic
uncertainty" are many, and they tend to
be quite complex.'1 Consequently, a
fictitious incident which is somewhat
simplified is helpful, and the following
selection is cited to clarify the picture.
"Sherlock Holmes desires to pro-
ceed from London to Dover and
hence to the Continent in order to
escape from Professor Moriarty who
pursues him. Having boarded the
train he observes, as the train pulls
out, the appearance of Professor
Moriarty on the platform. Sherlock
Holmes takes it for granted—and
in this he is assumed to be fully
justified—that his adversary, who
has seen him, might secure a special
train and overtake him. Sherlock
Holmes is faced with the alternative
of going to Dover or of leaving
the train at Canterbury, the only
intermediate station. His adversary
—whose intelligence is assumed to
be fully adequate to visualize these
possibilities—has the same choice.

INFRA-RED RADIATION
Infra-red radiation challenges radar as a meth-
od for remote detection, and finds new appli-
cations in chemistry and missiles research.
Infra-red guidance system for missile is smaller, lighter, less complex and less costly than equivalent radar guidance system.
Complications in old detective systems
and the ever-increasing need for a
quick and accurate method of analyzing
and determining the properties of un-
known compounds have placed increased
demands upon the scientific world for
over ten years. For a solution to the
problem, scientists turned to a relatively
old form of electromagnetic radiation—
infra-red. It was the Second World War
that spured the first intensive investiga-
tion and application of infra-red but in
this age of missiles, space satellites, and
discovery, its future and versatility is
seemingly unlimited.
Of course, the most common use of
inufra-red radiation is in photography.
Haziness due to clouds, fog, and other
atmospheric conditions will affect the re-
flection of light off objects in ordinary
photographs, but with an infra-red sens-
itive film and filter, a much clearer long
distance photograph may be taken. It is
also used to illuminate objects at night
by using an infra-red light source. Since
infra-red lies just outside visible light on
the electromagnetic spectrum, the light
is invisible, thereby making photograjhy
in the dark possible. It was during World
War II that this application was par-
ticularly valuable.
Every object above absolute zero
(—-273° C) generates infra-red radiation
within itself by molecular thermal action
over a wide spectral range. This is the
basic principle upon which all infra-reed
applications depend. The wave length at
which peak or maximum radiation occurs
varies inversely with the object's Kelvin

temperature. Its total radiation increases
as the fourth power of the temperature.
Since no known material today has this
theoretical absolute temperature, these
fundamental relationships are safely used
in detective devices without fear of
jamming, which is peculiar to present
day radar systems.
Compared with a radar detective
system, an infra-red system has a distinct
advantage. Infared detectors can dis-
criminate between and even identify near-
by objects. Radar, for example, cannot
separate two aircraft five miles away with
a one foot scanner unless they are more
than one and one-half miles apart. On
the other hand, with infra-red even
the engines of a twin-eengined air-
plane can be distinguished on a three-
inch scanner at the same distance. In
fact, the detector can yield the identity
of the type of aircraft from information
known about the peak radiation that an
individual aircraft engine generates.
Factors of Design
Although the infra-red systems are
challenging radar, they are much more
difficult to design. Three main factors
are important in their design. The first
is the radiation given off by the object,
or target, being studied whose character-
istics are determined by the relationships
stated above. Secondly, the distance
effects and atmospheric attenuation need
to be considered. Neglecting for a
moment the effects of the atmosphere,
the distance between the target and
detector determines the energy decrease
in the same way that visible light inten-
sity depends upon the distance. Except
for high-altitude work the atmosphere
tends to attenuate or eliminate certain
portions of the infared spectrum due to
moisture and carbon dioxide in the air.
Those portions of the spectrum through
which infra-red frequencies pass without
serious attenuation are called 'windows".
Infared Detector
The third problem in a system is its
main component, the detector, of which
there are two types used in military
infra-red systems. The first is the thermal
is to be scanned, but its sensitivity is low.
A correction for this is made by reducing
the thickness of the thermistor material
to less than 0.001 inch. A very fragile
component indeed!
Photoconductors are from ten to one
hundred times as sensitive as the thermal
cells but can be used for only a restricted
frequency range. The longer wavelengths
are usually eliminated, thereby reducing
the uselessness of this detector in systems
Infra-red guidance for air-to-air missile shows relative simplicity of an IR system.
type, or bolometer, which is made of a
thermistor material. An electric signal is
generated when infra-red rays strike the
detector and by changing its temperature
will change its resistance. The second
type of detector is the photoconductor.
It is composed of a semiconductor crystal
whose resistance is changed when photon
energy is absorbed.
Thermal detectors are ideally suited
to systems in which the entire spectrum
used in low-temperature work. This
hindrance may be eliminated by cooling
the cell to the temperature of liquid
oxygen or nitrogen. This leads to a bulky
and complex device which is impractical
in many cases.
To protect the detector and to easily
transmit those portions of the infra-red
spectrum which are to be used, an in-
fra-red or IRdome, is used in missiles.
It is the counterpart of the radome

found in radar systems. The material
used must be, besides having the above
specifications, rugged and durable under
all kinds of atmospheric conditions. At
the present time, a division of Union
Carbide Corporation, Linde Company, is
developing a synthetic crystal that will
meet all of the standards required. After
extensive experimentation, sapphire
(A1203) seems to be the best material
from which an IRdome can be made.
Application in Chemical Analysis
Although its military uses are most
predominant today, infra-red radiation is
also being used extensively in chemical
analysis. // may be used to determine the
structure of compounds, measure the
amount and purity of one material within
a compound, and even identify unknown
substances.
Every molecule of a substance is com-
posed of atoms which vibrate with re-
spect to each other at a certain frequency.
Atoms of like substances have the same
vibration frequency in the same way that
atoms of unlike substances have different
vibration frequencies. If infra-red radia-
tion of a known frequency strikes a sub-
stance whose atoms have the same vibra-
tion frequency, the rays will be absorbed
and will disappear. However, if infra-red
radiation strikes a substance whose fre-
quency is different, the rays pass through
unaltered.
This basic principle is used in quali-
tative analysis of unknown compounds.
The unknown substance is subjected to
all frequencies of infra-red radiation. A
graph of the result, when compared with
graphs of known compounds, will have
absorbtion peculiar to that material only.
Thus the material can be identified
quickly and easily whereas before the
compound had to be subjected to a
multitudinous number of tests before the
identification is made.
A spectrometer is the device used for
such analysis. It consists simply of a
heated source which radiates infra-red rays
of all frequencies, a prism which dis-
perses the individual frequencies, and a
slit system which permits the isolation
of the frequencies. The isolated fre-
quencies are then put in contact with a
detector which records each. A thermo-
couple turns the heat into an electrical
signal which drives the stylus on the
graph paper. Modern day spectrometers
usually have two separate beams, one in
which the sample is placed, and another
used for comparison.
With the launching of the two Soviet
earth satellites in October and November,
a new age in scientific advancement be-
gan. But more than that, it was the
advent of greater use of infra-red radia-
tion in missiles and in outer space satel-
lites themselves. The potentialities of in-
fra-red radiation, however, are not limited
to just chemical and military applications,
but these are the most predominate. If
it has taken only ten years to develop this,
just think of the progress that will have
been made ten years from now!

Floating Cargo
A revolutionary method of moving
heavy loads by floating them on a
cushion of pressurized air is under devel-
opment by the Douglas Aircraft com-
pany, J. L. Jones, general manager of
the Tulsa Division of Douglas revealed
today.
The new system, which Douglas ident-
ifies with the name "GLIDE-AIRE," will
make possible easy and rapid movement
of cargo in warehouses, on loading docks
and in prime movers. It also has possi-
bilities in the field of industrial materials
handling.
GLIDE-AIRE employs cargo pallets,
similar in appearance to those now used
in conventional warehousing and cargo-
handling. Materials are stacked on the
pallets and moved over floors or other
supporting surfaces on a cushion of air
which is released upward through the
floor when the pallets actuate individual
valves in the low pressure air system.
In an alternate application, low pres-
sure air can be released downward
through the pallets themselves, eliminat-
ing the necessity for installation of air
pressure equipment beneath the floor.
Since the pallets literally float on a
continuously flowing air cushion, they
can be moved in any direction with
amazingly little effort—much as a barge
on water can be moved by hand while
carrying tons of cargo.
Because of its ingenious yet simple
design, the GLIDE-AIRE system is com-
patible with conventional conveyor sys-
tems. Its advantages in flexibility and
simplicity can thus be utilized with
minimum change in existing facilities.
Although preliminary tests have dem-
onstrated tremendous advantages over
conventional systems of cargo conveyance
and materials handling, considerable
development effort lies ahead before
specific industrial applications can be
announced, C. R. Strang, chief engineer
of Douglas-Tulsa, said.
GLIDE-AIRE WAS conceived at the
Tulsa Division of Douglas in the course
of transportation studies on the C-132,
a huge logistics cargo aircraft which then
was under construction for the Air Force.
In its original concept, GLIDE-AIRE
was intended both to facilitate rapid
movement of cargo in and out of the
C-132, and as a dolly for transporting
the huge aircraft itself when the plane
was moved on the manufacturing floor.
Color TV in 3-D
The world's first closed-circuit three-
dimensional color television system has
been developed by the General Electric
Company for remote servicing of reactors
used in development of a nuclear air-
craft propulsion system.
D. Roy Shoults, general manager of
the company's aircraft Nuclear Propul-
sion Department (ANPD) at Evendale,
said that the color stereo system was
developed to permit use of color-coded
parts in reactor components and to pro-
vide the degree of precise depth per-
ception required for their correct posi-
tioning. The new system makes remote
adjustments of parts much easier than by
black and white, two-dimensional TV,
he said.
The new system was developed by the
General Electric General Engineering
Laboratory here and by the company's
Electronics Park, Syracuse, N.Y., for
ANPD's use at the Atomic Energy Com-
mission's test site. Idaho Falls, Id.
ANPD is developing an aircraft nuclear
propulsion system under contracts with
the Air force and the AEC.
The new General Electric TV system
is described by company engineers as
"currently not feasible for the American
living room," but suited for adaptation
to other uses for closed-circuit television.
Development of this new system marks
the first use of color television with
stereo, C. Q. Lemmond, manager of
particle and wave optics for the General
Engineering Laboratory, said.
Lemmond, in charge of development
of the new TV system, said, however,
that this is not the first time television
has been used with stereo.
In use, Shoults explained, the tele-
vision camera will be positioned inside
the radioactive area. The viewing screen
will be located a considerable distance
away, behind thick shielding walls and
near the controls of a mechanical man-
ipulator. Movements of the manipulator
inside the radioactive area will be directed
by a technician from the 3-D color
picture appearing on the screen.
The technician will view this picture
through special polarizing glasses similar
to those used with recent 3-D motion
pictures. Included with manipulator con-
trols will be one used to aim and focus
the twin lenses of the camera.
This system will also be used for other
28

including sales conferences, shareowner
meetings, switching operations in rail-
road yards, process controls in automatic
factories, and inspection and maintenance
of work.
Lemmond said that the new system
works like this:
The observer's viewpoint is effectively
transferred to that of a camera equipped
with a dual-optical system having per-
spective similar to that of the two eyes
of the observer.
However, instead of presenting the
pictorial image to two sensitive surfaces,
as the human eyes do, the stereo-TV
system presents two images to a single
sensitive surface, a television tube on a
time-sharing basis.
The frequency of the time sharing is
at the picture rate of the television
system, in this case 90 pictures a second.
By alternating 45 pictures a second for
each eye, engineers have eliminated any
objectionable flicker.
A rotating shutter in the special color-
TV camera alternately transmits the
scene as viewed from two points to the
camera's tube.
The distance between the two points
corresponds approximately to twice the
distance between a person's eyes.
In the viewing console, light from the
television image formed on the cathode
ray tube passes through a drum composed
of alternate segments of polarizing filters
with axes of polarization at right angles
to each other. The drum revolves in
synchronism with the television frame
rate of the camera and polarizes alternate
frames vertically and horizontally. Thus
all left-eye pictures are polarized in one
direction and all right-eye pictures are
polarized in the other direction.
An observer viewing the screen—with
his polarized spectacles — sees the left
optical path with is left eye and the
right optical path with the right. The
45-frame-per-second rate gives him
stereo-vision without an objectionable
flicker.
Laboratory tests were conducted on the
closed-circuit system using 250 feet of
cable, but engineers say the cable can be
lengthened to any required distance or
replaced by a radio link without losing
;larity, color, or three-dimensional effect.
Ultrasonic Irons Solder
Aluminum
Aluminum and its fast-oxidizing alloys
an now be soldered as readily as copper
by using an ultrasonic soldering iron,
reports Electronics, McGraw-Hill publi-
cation.
Light metals such as aluminum or
magnesium oxidize instantaneously after
casting, and solder, although molten,
cannot adhere to oxide film.
The electrically-heated tip of the new
ultrasonic soldering iron removes this
oxide layer. The tips of the heated iron,
vibrating at an ultrasonic frequency,
abrades the surface of the metal. At the
same moment, the molten solder flows
directly onto the abraded metal surface,
forming a firm alloy before further
oxidation can take place.
Any metal may now be soldered to
this tinned surface in the conventional
manner, and two pieces of aluminum
may be soldered together conventionally
by first ultrasonically tinning each surface.
Lithium Flouride Initiates Bubble
Phenomena
Square bubbles, the first such phenom-
ena ever observed in nature have been
found by a General Electric Company
scientist during experiments at the Knolls
Atomic Power Laboratory (KAPL).
Peter Senio, a metallurgist at the
laboratory, disclosed that brilliantly col-
ored microscopic bubbles in square and
rectangular forms appear in lithium flour-
ide crystals after they have been irrad-
iated with neutrons in a reactor, then
heated above 600 degrees Centigrade
(1,112 degrees Fahrenheit).
Square bubbles, Senior said, never have
been seen in any other material. No
bubbles of any kind were discovered by
Senio in lithium fluoride that was not
first irradiated with neutrons.
Lithium fluoride, he explained, is a
clear, glass-like material that he irradiates
to study the effects of neutron bombard-
ment and to associate the results with ma-
terials that make up a nuclear reactor.
Physical changes Senio is looking for
appear in lithium fluoride within a few
days rather than in months as is the case
in many metals.
During his studies, Senio found that
lithium bubbles appear first in bright
colors. The colors, he said, show that
these bubbles have a third dimension,
even though they are extremely thin,
measuring only about three one-hundred-
thousandths of an inch.
As the bubbles thicken, they turn
white.
Senio said he believes formation of
helium and tritium gases in the irradiated
lithium is responsible for the bubbles.
So far, however, he is at a loss to explain
why square and rectangular bubbles ap-
pear rather than conventional spherical
ones.
At first glance, he said, the box-like
bubbles have no practical value, but
could lead to important scientific findings
regarding the fundamental atomic struc-
ture of matter.
"It will take a lot of study to explain
why nature allows bubbles of this type
to form in one material and not in
others," he said.
These unique bubbles are formed this
way:
Small pieces of clear lithium are irrad-
iated with neutrons in a reactor. Once
irradiated, they turn black.
Next, these crystals are heated in a
laboratory furnace. When they reach
about 450 degrees Centigrade (842
degrees Fahrenheit), they turn clear, or
almost clear, again.
When heated to about 700 degrees
Centigrade (1,292 degrees Fahrenheit)
for several hours, they look frosty to the
naked eye. At this stage they are taken
from the furnace and allowed to cool.
Studied under a microscope, the crystals
reveal color squares formed inside and
most frequently along natural faults in
the lithium fluoride crystals. Over-all
appearance of groups of the bright bub-
bles is somewhat similar to squares used
in stain glass windows arranged in
cubist design.
If the temperature of the furnace is
boosted about 700 degrees Centigrade,
the bubbles inside the crystals turn white
and their corners begin to round.
As the melting point of lithium fluor-
ide, 842 degrees Centigrade (1,547 de-
grees Fahrenheit), is approached, the
bubbles grow and combine to form new
shapes that resemble sausages, donuts,
boomerangs and many other familiar
objects.
Ultimate form of the bubbles during
heating near the melting point of the
crystals, appears to be spherical as would
be expected.

Research Laboratories to help Unravel
one of the greatest riddles of modern
physics: the "why" of superconductivity
—that strange behavior of certain metals,
in which, at low temperatures, electric-
currents apparently flow forever.
The experiments arc the work of four
Westinghouse research physicists, Dr. M.
A. Biondi, Dr. A. T. Forrester, Dr. M.
P. Garfunkel and Dr. A. O. McCoubrey.
"Although superconductivity has been
known for about 50 years, our under-
standing of it is quite incomplete," Dr.
Biondi declared. "Occurring only near
absolute zero, —459 degrees Fahrenheit,
it represents a state of matter completely
foreign to what man ordinarily encoun-
ters. It is a scientific frontier which offers
a real challenge for further investigation.
"Materials in the superconducting state
exhibit remarkable properties. Best
known, perhaps, is their ability to con-
duct electricity perfectly. In a ring of
the purest copper attainable an electric
current, once started, dies out in about
one second; in a superconductor, as far
as we know, it flows forever.
"Since electrons are known to be the
'carriers' of electricity, those in a super-
conductor must be in a very special
state—one in which they can move about
with no friction whatsoever. Physicists
have speculated that they may be 'con-
densed' out of the state in which they
normally move through the metal.
"Unfortunately, we cannot test this
theory by observing the electrons direct-
ly, but must study them by indirect
means. Our microwave experiments are
the latest of several methods of attack
on this problem which have been under-
way at the Westinghouse Research Labor-
atories for five years. This research has
been motivated by the realization that
a definite answer to the condensed elec-
tron theory would be of major im-
portance in explaining superconductivity."
Dr. Biondi explained that the super-
frequency waves are used to "bombard'
a superconducting metal such as alumi-
num or tin that is held at a temperature
less than one degree above absolute zero.
The waves are absorbed by the metal,
which "soaks up" enough energy to lift
its electrons from the superconducting
to the normal conducting state. Measure-
ments are made of the energy required
for different temperatures of the metals.
"Our microwave experiments, together
with the other experiments carried out
at our laboratories, show that there is,
indeed, a condensed electron state in
superconductors," Dr. Biondi declared
"The results already have greatly in-
creased our understanding of the mech-
anism of superconductivity, and we art
extending our studies to even more de-
tailed investigations."
The scientist said that the microwave
experiments must be carried out with
unusual care and preciseness. The micro-
waves, generated by a special "transmit-
ter" and carried by tiny "wave guides,"
must be of precise frequency and power.
They oscillate back and forth at the
fantastic rate of 200 billion vibrations
per second.
In a typical experiment, the microwave
power absorbed by the superconductor
is only about one-millionth of a watt.
This tiny amount of power raises the
temperature of the superconducting metal
about one-thousandth of one degree. Yet.
so sensitive are the thermometers used
in the experiment, they can detect temp-
erature changes a hundred times smaller,
or only ten-millionths of a degree.
Because of the tiny temperature
changes involved, keeping the super-
conductor (at nearly 459 degrees below
zero) completely isolated from the heat
of the laboratory is a major problem
To do it, the metal is immersed in liquid
helium inside a special flask, which is
itself surrounded by a similar insulating
flask containing liquid nitrogen at a
temperature of minus 320 degrees Fahr-
enheit.

"Since the day we decided to get married, I've been
doing a lot of thinking about our future. It's time I
made a choice on a career. I've talked to the Dean of
Engineering, most of my professors, and to some of the
fellows who have graduated, and you know, they all
said the same thing.
"They all agree that the aircraft and missile industry
holds the best opportunities and the brightest future for
an engineer these days. What they said makes sense,
too, because developments in this field today really give
a fellow an opportunity to make important contribu
tions on vital projects.
"Not only that, but the aircraft industry is noted for
its good salaries. Generous benefits, too. And advance-
ment in both salary and position is limited only by how
far I want to go."
Unlimited opportunities, high salaries, company-paid
benefits unheard of until a few years ago — these
are only a few of the reasons why so many young engi-
neers with a keen eye to the future are choosing the
aircraft industry.
It is only natural that many engineering graduates
should consider joining Northrop Aircraft, Inc., be-
cause the company shares its many successes with every
member of its engineering and scientific team. Ad-
vanced projects at Northrop are now in production, and
active top-priority projects mean rapid advancement
and success for the individual engineer.
Such projects include the famous Snark SM-62,
world's first intercontinental guided missile, now being
activated in the first United States Air Force missile
squadron; the USAFT-38 supersonic twin-jet ad-
vanced trainer; and other important missile and
manned aircraft weapon systems and components.
Engineers in more than thirty categories contribute

graphic plate, making a record of the
shock wave configuration.
The photography of shock phenomena
by means of nearly parallel light beams
which fall directly on the photographic
plate after passing through the flow field
is known as the shadowgraph method. In
passing through the shock tube, the light
is reflected by inhomogeneities in the
index of refraction of the gas, and if a
shock front is present in the test section
at the time the spark is fired, the light
will be refracted toward the denser side
of the shock front. The effect of this is
to produce a line on the plate in which
the photographic density is very low,
and a line close to this where the density
is correspondingly higher, the light which
is deflected away from the former of
these falling on the plate to produce the
latter.
A region in which the gradient of
the index of refraction is uniform will
not produce any change in the photo-
graphic density on the plate, since the
light which passes through such a region
will be deflected as a whole. The gradient
of the index of refraction is, of course,
very large in the shock front, and zero,
or nearly so, on either side of it. It is
this rapid change in the gradient of
refractive index which enables the shock
front to be photographed by the shadow-
graph method. The appearance of the
shadowgram is affected by the distance
of the plate from the shock front which
is being photographed, since the direction
of the beam of light which is refracted
by the shock front makes a slight angle
with the direction of the undeflected
beam, and also since the undeflected
beam cannot ever be exactly parallel.
Chemical Kinetics
The use of the shock tube for the
study of high-speed chemical reactions
has been widespread. While the ability
of the shock tube to heat gases to high
temperatures is important in chemical
studies, it is of only secondary im-
portance when compared to the precision
with which the state of the gas can be
monitored. Indeed, if the shock velocity
is measured, the enthalpy of the gas
behind the shock wave may be accurately
determined. The time of heating is small
and heat losses due to radiation and
conduction may be safely neglected.
Further, the shock wave processes the
gas homogeneously and uniformly so that
when the shock tube is used as a chemical
reactor, the spatial variation of properties
in the reacting mixture is small. Here
at Michigan a rather intensive study of
dctonative combustion has been under
way since 1952, and the shock tube is
the most convenient tool for this research
work. Another "first" here was the con-
struction of the sector shock tube. The
standard tube for plane normal shocks
with attenuation due solely to viscosity,
heat conduction, or radiation, is indeed
a most useful scientific instrument, but
it does not help in the understanding
of real blast effects. The investigation oi
spherical shocks is possible either through
the study of actual detonations in the
field or by model experiments such as the
bursting of a glass sphere through over-
pressure. However, the former experi-
ments do not lend themselves to photo-
graphic observation, while the latter type
has always been on such a small scale-
as to make the three-dimensional shock
tube more a toy than a scientific instru-
ment. The investigation of cylindrical
shock waves constitutes, therefore, an
interesting link between the study of
plane shocks and the difficult study of
spherical shocks. Furthermore, a cylin-
drical shock wave is actually advanced
by a bomb-type explosion.
An extremely recent development has
been the introduction of the multiple-
chamber shock tube. This allows for
even higher speeds and Mach numbers
in testing than were previously attainable.
The Future
As mentioned earlier, shock tubes have
been employed for some time in the
study of high temperature chemiul
kinetics. By using a combination of close-
ly controlled shock and expansion waves
a sample of gaseous reactant can be pro-
cessed through a controlled temperature
the shape of which can often be tailored
to the precise need. One of the first
reactions tested in the laboratory was the
formation of nitric oxide in air. In this
experiment, a sample of air was heated
to extremely high temperature; it was
so high in fact, that some of the nitrogen
combined with the oxygen. Then by the
passage of an expansion wave through
it, the gas was cooled so suddenly that
the nitric oxide was left in the combined
state after the experiment. Since nitrates
are the basis of important fertilizers, this
experiment suggests the exciting possi-
bility that we may one day employ shock
waves in air to manufacture fertilizer.
Thus, by turning the force of explosions
into plant food, the aeronautical engineer
may have found a way of beating swords
into plowshares.

ENGINEERING BOOKSHELF
In one complete listing the Technic presents McGraw-Hill's de-
tailed technological bibliography covering 21 special fields. This
list should prove to be of real value to those who clip it out for
future reference.
Adequate quick-reference material is
essential in present-day design engi-
neering. Many companies, recognizing
this fact, have set up—or are in process of
setting up—their own technical libraries.
Most engineers have personal ones, but
they may be badly out of date or other-
wise inadequate.
Lists of recommended books have been
compiled here to aid in the choice and
acquisiton of some of the best references
in certain limited fields of interest. Their
greatest value will be in calling unknown
or unfamiliar titles to the attention of the
reader, and to guide the researcher to
those books most likely to be of help in
his work.
The Personal Library
Good reference books are terse, in-
formative, comprehensive without exces-
sive detail, practical rather than theoreti-
cal in approach, and usually well indexed.
Handbooks, then, provide the most
value per dollar, and the most conven-
ience per pound. They are written for
the reader who is familiar with basic
principles, but needs a reminder about the
exact form of an equation, a screw thread,
or the tensile strength of a metal.
Some forty or fifty handbooks are avail-
able today ranging in price from $4.00
to nearly $20.00. It is encouraging to
note that while they are three to six
times larger than the average text, their
cost is comparable or at most double that
of most technical books.
A selected list of handbooks for the
designer is boxed at left. These twelve
tomes are not all indispensable, but there
is remarkably little duplication of in-
formation except in one or two cases
covering the same field. In most, the cov-
erage is broad rather than specialized,
applied rather than theoretical, and refer-
ences are usually included at the begin-
ning or end of individual chapters for
further study.
As a group these are probably the most
valuable additions to a personal library;
there is much to be said for having them
within arm's reach. Minor questions may
then be quickly answered when there is
neither the time nor patience for library
research. Therefore, an engineer's per-
sonal library, whether at home or office,
should include many or all of these hand-
books. Specialized texts may be added as
needed or as interest dictates.
The Company Library
Few individuals need or can afford a
more complete collection than that men-
tioned above. Libraries of 100 or more
books are necessarily and properly the
responsibility of the company. To be
effective, even the smallest company li-
brary needs the organization that can be
supplied only by an interested, enthus-
iastic, and intelligent individual. Whether
small or large, consisting of 100 books or
100,000, the services of a library extend
far beyond the accumulation and catalog-
ing of books, and a well organized library
will pay for itself in convenience and
research time many times over.
Just what are the proper functions of
the company library? A library will ac-
quire, classify, house, and circulate books,
periodicals, journals, government publi-
cations and manufacturerers' catalogs. At
its smallest it will contain 50 or 100 books
and perhaps file of 20 or more of the
most recent periodicals. Manufacturers'
catalogs and literature may also be stored,
and this is probably the messiest job of
all to keep in reasonable order.
Somebody already employed in the
company can be held responsible for such
a library—but a word of caution is in
order here. Libraries grow at a fantastic
rate. To be at all useful, they must be
permitted to grow. When small, the en-
tire collection can be taken in at a glance,
and cataloging and control may be kept
at a minimum. Double the collection, and
time and attention needed may be quad-
rupled. A card catalog becomes manda-
tory. Some sort of checking system is re-
3*

quired to keep track of who has what.
New purchases and periodical subscrip-
tions must be kept up to date. These
responsibilities are far beyond the capaci-
ties of the average employee, even full
time. A trained librarian has taken a
postgraduate course leading to the mas-
ter's degree in library science to prepare
for this job.
Starting a company library involves
forethought as well as investment—more
planning than money really. Without a
plan and a proper librarian, the invest-
ment is wasted and the library is an ir-
ritation rather than an aid.
Before starting a library, consult a
trained librarian. The Special Libraries
Association, 13 East 10 Street, New York
3, N. Y., can recommend a consultant in
or near your city who, for a fee, will
help in the critical planning stages. This
is probably the best investment that could
be made at this stage.
A trained library consultant will choose
a cataloging system best suited to the
company needs, present and future. She
will list the more important bibliogra-
phies, and will possibly set up a schedule
for their eventual acquisition. She will es-
timate required shelf space initiate inter-
library contacts, and help choose and train
the company librarian. Best of all, having
been instrumental in its birth, she will
be naturally concerned with its progress.
It is a real comfort to the inexperienced
librarian to have expert and sympathetic
advice no further away than the tele-
phone.
As the library grows, the necessity for
a full-time trained librarian becomes more
urgent. Unfornately, the shortage of
qualified librarians is quite as severe as
the shortage of engineers. The Special
Libraries Asociation maintains a place-
ment service that may be helpful in this
regard.
Books
The trained librarian is not an engineer
and cannot be expected to have more than
a general idea of the specific contents of
the library. Staff members will know or
can evaluate their own book needs from
starter list similar to the one that follows.
Once familiar with the company and its
interests, the company librarian will be
able to screen Publishers' lists, book re-
views, and the various publications devot-
ed to the announcement aand review of
new books. Staff advice on desirable ac-
quisitions and an eye to the budget will
then establish a book-order list.
Good bibliographies are difficult to
compile, and a starter list must, of neces-
sity, reflect the interest and opinions of
the compiler. Because new books are pub-
lished every day, no list is much better
than last week's newspaper. Certain books,
of course, have more long-term value than
others. Handbooks should be included in
a library of any size, and they can be
expected to be of lasting value. Yet even
handbooks are revised at frequent inter-
vals, and it is wise to keep the library
copy as recent as possible.
Certain classes in individual fields will
retain their value indefinitely. Once a
truly definitive work has been published,
it will be referred to over and over again
in the bibliographies and references of
later works. Often major derivations or
enunciations of principle are never com-
pletely repeated but altered or expanded
upon by later authors. For these reasons
some of the texts included in the ac-
companying starter list have publication
dates 20 or 30 years old. However, where
possible, latest editions were considered
for inclusion first and earlier texts added
only when it was felt inadvisable to omit
them. Obviously, final choice of a book is
somewhat arbitrary, aand favorites are
bound to be omitted, but the list is
primarily intended to suggest titles which
may be unfamiliar or forgotten.
All listed titles have been highly recom-
mended either by publisher (for those
not yet in print), technical librarian, or
expert in the particular field. Where
possible, latest editions and most recent
prices have been listed, although these are
subject to change without notice.

with markedly less resistance.
Now in the development stage, it will bring such
important benefits as better performance, higher effi-

Developed in Westinghouse Research Laboratories,
Cubex is the result of continuous programs of research

in the field of Aerodynamics
Although each successive chapter in
the history of aircraft engines has as-
signed new and greater importance
to the problems of aerodynamics,
perhaps the most significant de-
velopments came with the dawn of
the jet age. Today, aerodynamics
is one of the primary factors in-
fluencing design and performance of
an aircraft powerplant. It follows,
then, that Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft
— world's foremost designer and
builder of aircraft engines — is as
active in the broad field of aero-
dynamics as any such company
could be.
Although the work is demanding,
by its very nature it offers virtually
unlimited opportunity for the aero-
dynamicist at P &amp; W A. He deals
with airflow conditions in the en-
gine inlet, compressor, burner, tur-
bine and afterburner. From both the
theoretical and applied viewpoints,
he is engrossed in the problems of
perfect, viscous and compressible
flow. Problems concerning boundary
layers, diffusion, transonic flow,
shock waves, jet and wake phenom-
ena, airfoil theory, flutter and
stall propagation — all must be at-
tacked through profound theoretical
and detailed experimental processes.
Adding further to the challenge and
complexity of these assignments at
P &amp; W A is this fact: the engines
developed must ultimately perform
in varieties of aircraft ranging from
supersonic fighters to intercontinen-
tal bombers and transports, func-
tioning throughout a wide range of
operational conditions for each type.
Moreover, since every aircraft is
literally designed around a power-
plant, the aerodynamicist must con-
tinually project his thinking in such
a way as to anticipate the timely
application of tomorrow's engines to
tomorrow's airframes. At his service
are one of industry's foremost com-
puting laboratories and the finest
experimental facilities.
Aerodynamics, of course, is only
one part of a broadly diversified en-
gineering program at Pratt &amp; Whit-
ney Aircraft. That program — with
other far-reaching activities in the
fields of instrumentation, combus-
tion, materials problems and me-
chanical design — spells out a
gratifying future for many of to-
day's engineering students.
electronic computers accelerate both the analy-
d the solution of aerodynamic problems. Some of
problems include studies of airplane performance
permit evaluation of engine-to-airframe applications.
Design of a multi-stage, axial-flow compressor
Involves some of the most complex problems In
the entire field of aerodynamics. The work of
aerodynamlclsts ultimately determines those aspects
of blade and total rotor design that are crucial.
Mounting a compressor in a special high-altitude test
chamber in P &amp; w A's Willgoos Turbine Laboratory per-
mits study of a variety of performance problems that
may be encountered during later development stages.
Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft operates a
completely self-contained engineering fa-
cility in East Hartford, Connecticut, and
is now building a similar facility in Palm
Beach County, Florida. For further in-
formation about engineering careers at
Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, write to Mr.
F. W. Powers, Engineering Department.

Bibliographies
Certainly not all eight bibliographies
listed below need be purchased, particu-
larly for a small starting library. How-
ever, at least one, Books in Print, can be
very helpful when a title or author is
known without the vital information
about publisher, date of publication and
cost. Others may be purchased as the
need arises and the better large libraries
have them all.
One of the major duties of any li-
brarian is to be aware of new books and
periodicals so that her library will not
lack an important work. To this end she
will spend time reading book reviews in
the many periodicals, publishers' lists,
Special Libraries Association publications,
and many other new-book announcements.
The Technical Book Review Index is
convenient for this purpose. It is an up-to-
date listing of newly published books and
includes abstracts of book reviews from
technical journals. These are invaluable
in informing the librarian about what has
been published, its content and approxi-
mate value to the company.

Bibliographical References
Often a problem will require an expert
consultant rather than published informa-
tion. Perhaps more detailed data are need-
ed than appeared in a particular paper or
book. One convenient source of bio-
graphical information is a membership
list of the applicable technical society.
Most engineers are members of at least
one and probably more than one) society
and the societies regularly distribute lists
of names and addresses of their members.

General Library Reference
Certain general reference books are in-
dispensable to the proper operation of a
library. If there is an unabridged diction-
ary anywhere in the company, put it in the
library. Put it on a high table for easy
access when standing and leave enough
room so that it may be opened and left
that way. Nothing discourages dictionary
use so much as the need to carry it to a
table across the room and back again.
A comprehensive encyclopedia like the
Americana or Britannica is a natural and
very worthwhile addition to the collec-
tion. Several other dictionaries and gen-
eral reference books are listed below.
Special attention should be given to
Lucille Jackson's Technical Libraries. This
is the best available work on the organi-
zation and management of technical
libraries.

Periodicals
Society publications that appear regular-
ly, trade journals, magazines and house-
organs pour into the mails in an unending
stream. It is virtually impossible for any
one individual to read or even scan the
publications in all of these fields, yet a
professional cannot ignore this flood. New
developments, theories and experimental
data appear in periodicals long before
they are made available in book form, and
often this is the only place they ever will
appear.
Many companies have set up involved
abstracting or distribution systems to limit
reading time to a minimum without block-
ing the flow of information to the staff-
The problem then shifts to the need for a
well-informed individual who can screen
and direct the incoming information to
the proper staff member.
A librarian, particularly one having
some science training, can handle this
job, but if it is an added burden to her
other responsibilities she will soon fall
behind in this monumental task and the
whole system will collapse. No one solu-
tian to this problem is applicable to all
companies. Most engineers will subscribe
to and read two or three or more trade

are you going to

Perhaps you have heard some classmate say, almost complacently,
"Times have changed."
With many branches of industry today openly competing for good
science and engineering graduates, who can blame the young graduate-to-be
for feeling supremely confident. You know you can get a job,
know that salaries are high and are fully aware that
men with technical backgrounds are moving up to administrative
positions in ever-increasing numbers.
Nevertheless, in many respects, times have not changed at all.
That "first job" is every bit as important today as it was five, ten, twenty
years ago. Starting salaries remain only one of many factors to be
considered. And a man's future is still necessarily linked to the future
of the company for which he works. Moreover, a thoughtful examination
of such matters as potential growth, challenge, advancement policy,
facilities, degree of self-direction, permanence, benefits and the like often
indicates that real opportunity still does not grow on trees.

by Professor SYDNEY CHAPMAN
Here is the complete story of the beginnings of the
I.G. Y. as told by the man who knows most about it.
FIVE years ago the national scientific
academies throughout the world re-
ceived letters inviting them to take part
in 1957-58, in a year's special study of
the polar regions. The plan was to
repeat with enlarged scope, two earlier
years of polar research — the Interna-
tional Polar Years. The first was in
1882-83. The second was 50 years later,
in 1932-33- Thus the proposal was that
a third should follow after only 25 years.
Some of the academies that had taken
part in the earlier Polar Years agreed
to renew their effort. Among them were
the National Academies of Science of the
U.S.A. and of France, and the Royal
Society of London, England. But most
of the letters brought no response. There
are dozens of nations unable or unwilling
to engage in polar research.
The letters were sent out by a com-
mittee appointed by the International
Council of Scientific Unions (I.C.S.U.)
This is the premier body in international
pure science. Its members are of two
kinds: the national scientific academies,
and the international unions for the
many different branches of science.
Birth of the Plan
The committee was appointed on the
recommendation of three of these—those
for radio science, for astronomy, and for
the earth sciences, geodesy and geophys-
ics. The proposal had reached these
unions from a small committee which
linked all three—the joint committee on
the ionosphere (J.C.I.)—of which Sir
Edward Appleton is the chairman. Dr.
Lloyd Berkner, one of its members, was
the originator of the proposal. He had
first made it to a small group of earth
scientists — of whom I was privileged to
be one — meeting socially on the eve-
ning of April 5, 1950, in the Maryland
home of Dr. J. A. Van Allen. Berkner
and I jointly proposed to the JCI that
there should be a third polar year.
Later in 1952 the proposal was ex-
tended to cover the physical study of the
whole earth, and of the sun. Thus the
enterprise became the International Geo-
physical Year (briefly, the I.G.Y.). And
the committee to organize it became the
C.S.A.G.I. (Comite Special de l'Annee
Geophysique Internationale). This first
met in July, 1953 in Brussels. The
Belgian scientist Dr. M. Nicolet became
General Secretary, and the central offices
of the I.G.Y. organization were set up
there.
The first task of the committee was
to draw up the initial draft of the I.G.Y.
plans. It had before it the Polar Year
plans drafted by the J.C.I., and the
national programmes of the academies
that had agreed to join in the third Polar
Year. The representatives of several of
these academies met with the C.S.A.G.I.
to help in this task. The C.S.A.G.I. itself
is not composed of national delegates.
Its members represent different interna-
tional scientific unions, and the I.C.S.U.,
and also the World Meteorological Or-
ganization (W.M.O.). All of these are
non-governmental except the W.M.O.
60 Participants
After the 1953 meeting, new letters
to the other national scientific academies
invited them to take part in the I.G.Y.,
and the enlarged I.G.Y. plans were en-
closed. These letters had a notably more
favorable response. And since then, year
by year, the number of countries taking
part has grown till now it exceeds sixty.
Year by year, also, the scope of the
scientific plans has been widened. As
a result, the I.G.Y. has become incom-
parably the greatest international scien-
tific enterprise ever launched.
The I.G.Y. organization is an associa-
tion of international scientific bodies and
of national scientific academies. It is non-
political. Scientists come together at its
meetings, in harmonious cooperation from
countries between which, unfortunately,
there are deep political divisions. Yet
the scientific academies of these countries
have all succeeded in getting their gov-

The author of this article is Sydney Chapman, born in Eccles,
Lancashire, England. After receiving his D.Sc. at Cambridge
University in 1913, he was chief astronomer at the Royal Observa-
tory in Greenwich and was a lecturer and professor at Trinity
College, Oxford; Manchester University; and Imperial College,
London. At present he is Sedleian Professor of Natural Philo-
sophy, Queen's College, Oxford and Professor of Geophysics at
the University of Alaska. Since his former stay at the University,
Chapman has been engaged in geophysical research over the
country and is presently International President of the Comite
Special du Annee Gcophysique Internationale which heads the
International Geophysical Year. Prof. Chapman probably knows
more about the whole of IGY than anyone else in the world to-
day. We are extremely fortunate to have this very busy man

ernments to provide the money for their
respective parts in the I.G.Y. program.
Many of them have also been enabled
to contribute to the expenses of the
central organization. At first these were
supplied by I.C.S.U., with special grants
from the United Nations Educational,
Scientific Cultural Organization (U.N.-
E.S.C.O.). But in 1956 the expenses
grew beyond the scope of these grants.
The central expenses are a very small
"overhead" item in the whole I.G.Y.
budget. It has been estimated that the
whole sum spent and to be spent on the
I.G.Y. will exceed $300 million. The
total central expenditure is estimated at
less than a tenth of 1 per cent of the
whole cost. The Belgian and other gov-
ernments have given facilities of many
kinds, and much time and effort has
been freely given by scientists, to the
central planning.
The I.G.Y. is expensive. But its cost
is as a drop in the bucket compared with
the cost of a year of war, or with the
annual defense budgets of the world,
in our uneasy times. Actually the I.G.Y.
is a year and a half—it began on July
1, 1957, and will continue till the end
of 1958. But in the Antarctic its work
has been in progress for more than a
year, and will continue until the spring
of 1959, when the expedition can return
home.
Why have the governments been
willing to provide so much public money
for the I.G.Y.? It is because the scien-
tific academies have been able to con-
vince them and their parliaments of its
national value. The developments of
science and its applications have helped
mankind towards a world view of our
common interests and destinies. One of
the interests transcending political di-
visions is a knowledge of the physical
properties of the planet we all inhabit,
and progress towards an understanding
of its future changes. The earth has seen
great changes, much affecting our earlier
ancestors. They suffered during the ice
ages, and multiplied with increasing
warmth. But they could not understand
or foresee either change. We inherit
much from the past. In the I.G.Y. we
seek to gain knowledge of present benefit
to our successors.
The scientific scope of the I.G.Y. is
too great and too technical to be indi-
cated here, even in outline. Only a few
outstanding features can be mentioned.
The I.G.Y. is mainly concerned with
those earth phenomena whose under-
standing requires continued simultaneous
observation of several associated proper-
ties of the earth and sun. Only thus can
we trace out the links between their
changes.
Air and Ocean
The sun warms the earth and the
oceans and the atmosphere, and sets up
large scale circulations in the air and
seas. The small scale weather changes
are super-imposed on these. It is an
immense task to map out these currents.
Even during the I.G.Y. the men, money,
and materials available will not fully
suffice. Hence there has been careful
planning to make the best use of our
resources—partly by special concentration
of key meridians and zones, and also
by stepping up the effort on three World
Days each month, and during six Meteor-
ological Intervals of 10 days each. All
this meteorological work is an extension
of programs that are normal in the parts
of the world that are most scientifically
developed. The great expansion during
the I.G.Y. will undoubtedly bring marked

Marquardt Means Opportunity
TTie Marquardt Aircraft Company was founded in November, 1944 to conduct research,
development, and manufacturing operations in ramjet propulsion. From the beginning,
the principle company objective was to establish and maintain a high level of com-
petence in engineering.
Both because of the national need and the inclination and experience of the key
people, Marquardt has continued to pioneer the development of products containing
a high content of scientific and engineering newness. Prominent examples are the
supersonic ramjet, providing cruise power for the Boeing Bomarc interceptor missile
and the Lockheed X-7 Test Vehicle; ram air auxiliary power packages, on the Chance
Vought F-8U and the Lockheed F-104A; thrust reversers; afterburners; and a wide
range of ramjet and turbojet controls and accessories.
Since the technical areas available to a company specializing in advanced controls
and propulsion work are numerous, you will find a broad range of engineering oppor-
tunities at Marquardt. Check your Placement Office for dates when Marquardt rep-
resentatives will visit your school, or write Dock Black, Professional Personnel, Mar-

WORLD'S LARGEST ELECTRONIC BRAIN
RCA BIZMAC reduces weeks of paper
work to seconds—cuts costs by millions I
In almost the twinkling of an eye, electronics
handles calculations that would take any person
days of work.
The newest — and largest — electronic "brain"
(more accurately, electronic data processing sys-
tem) is Bizmac, developed by RCA.
Bizmac is quickly becoming one of the most
powerful allies of business and industry. It "reads,"
sorts, catalogs, analyzes, calculates, forecasts—re-
duces months of paper work to seconds—cuts costs
by millions!
For insurance companies, Bizmac can keep its
finger on millions of facts daily. It can help depart-
ment stores keep split-second inventory control.
And for the U. S. Army, it keeps track of literally
billions of ordnance parts all over the world.
The leadership in electronic research that made
Bizmac possible is inherent in all RCA products
and services—to help make life fuller, easier, safer
through "Electronics for Living." tmk&lt;.&gt;®

Indices
Two major abstracting and indexing
services are available for extensive cover-
age of the technical literature. The Engi-
neering Index, published by Engineering
Index, Inc., 29 West 39th Street, New
York 18, N.Y., abstracts important ar-
ticles from some 1200 periodicals and 300
books yearly in all languages. These are
printed on standard library-sized cards
and then mailed weekly to subscribers.
Three hundred divisions comprise the
subject coverage and may be subscribed to
individually or in groups. Division sub-
scribers vary in cost from $10.00 to
$45.00 per year. The complete service
turns out about 25,000 cards annually and
is available at a special rate. An annual
volume is also available.
The Industrial Arts Index is published
by H. W. Wilson Co., 950 University
Ave., New York 52, N.Y., and limits its
service to a subject index of articles in
over 200 engineering, trade, and business
periodicals. This index is issued monthly
and cumulated quarterly and annually.
Manufacturers' Literature
Whether it has a formal library or not.
every manufacturing company large or
small must include provisions for the ac-
quisition, storage and dissemination of
manufacturers' catalogs and bulletins. Pur-
chased items often make up a large per-
centage of the final assembled product,
and speedy design depends on the avail-
ability of detailed information about raw
material, fasteners and other mechanical
and electrical parts.
Manufacturers' literature is obtained by
letterhead request usually in response to
an advertisement or literature announce-
ment. A collection is initiated by the in-
terests and needs of the individuals who
will use it. Keeping this collection up-to-
date, however, is often the responsibility

START TODAY TO
PLAN TOMORROW
By knowing about some of the projects underway at the
Babcock &amp; Wilcox Company, an engineer may see his
personal avenues of growth and advancement. For today
B&amp;W stands poised at a new era of expansion and
development.
Here's an indication of what's going on at B&amp;W, with
the consequent opportunities that are opening up for
engineers. The Boiler Division is building the world's
largest steam generator. The Tubular Products Division
recently introduced extruded seamless titanium tubing,
one result of its metallurgical research. The Refractories
Division developed the first refractory concrete that will
withstand temperatures up to 3200 F. The Atomic Energy
Division is under contract by the AEC to design and
build the propulsion unit of the world's first nuclear-
powered cargo vessel.
These are but a few of the projects — not in the plan-
ning stage, but in the actual design and manufacturing
phases — upon which B&amp;W engineers are now engaged.
The continuing, integrated growth of the company offers
engineers an assured future of leadership.
How is the company doing right now? Let's look at one
line from the Annual Stockholders' Report.

Both opponents must choose the
place of their detainment in ignor-
ance of the other's corresponding
decision. If, as a result of these
measures, they should find them-
selves, in fine, on the same platform,
Sherlock Holmes may with certainty
expect to be killed by Moriarty. If
Sherlock Holmes reaches Dover un-
harmed he can make good his
escape." 4
What should be Sherlock Holmes' de-
cision? Since this is a matter of "stra-
tegic uncertainty," it is wise to consider
Professor Moriarty's moves first, for he
has nothing to lose except the effort it
takes him, while Sherlock Holmes might
lose as much as his life. If Sherlock
Holmes is to make good his escape, he
must go to Dover and not to Canterbury.
But for Moriarty to prevent Holmes'
escape, he, too, must go to Dover. Thus,
for Moriarty, going to Dover is his choice
as rational behavior. Therefore, Holmes,
in order to minimize his loss and prolong
his life as much as possible, will not
go to Dover, but instead get off at
Canterbury. For him, going to Dover is
inadmissible, and the number of possible
moves is accordingly reduced. From this
point forward he may proceed as if
"pure chance" existed. This is somewhat
trivial in this business, because only one
more move is available, and it must be
his choice. However, consider the possi-
bility of there being two or more inter-
mediate stops between London and
Dover. Moriarty would still go to Dover
for the same reason given above, but
now Holmes would have two or more
admissible moves from which to choose,
and the situation of "pure chance" would
no longer be trivial. But it should be
noted that sufficient facts have not been
presented to enable him to reason and
then come to a rational decision.
Steps in Decision-Making
At last we have discussed the essential
elements of decision-making. The last
example given above typifies the general
case which involves three steps: ruling

Theory of Games and Economic Behavior,

out certain alternatives at the beginning,
extrapolating logic to cover every possi-
ble alternative so that moves may be
designated, and choosing by a value
judgment the move which will yield the
most satisfaction. It is now time to at-
tempt to discover which of these steps
contribute to giving life's activities in-
terest, and whose elimination would yield
routine dull chores.
The separation of the admissible
alternatives from the inadmissible al-
ternatives, illustrated by the Holmes-
Moriarty conflict, is essentially a matter
of puzzle solving; it is only a mental
exercise. Thus, this is not the part of
making decisions which is the keystone
of interest in life's activities.
The reasoning required to extend logic
from the statement of the uncertainty to
various moves, as depicted by the ball-
game and kitchen situations, is a task
that could readily be performed by
anyone or even by a machine. Only a
meager perception of all the various
outcomes is required to list them. There-
fore, it is obvious that this is not the
phase of making decisions which gives
interest to life's activities.
Hence, by elimination it is found that
the process of determining what is
rational behavior, that is, the actual mak-
ing of the value judgment, is the interest-
giving feature in decision-making. Value
judgments, which cannot really be per-
formed by anyone or anything else, are
the essential feature of one's enjoying
his activities.
And in addition, it is important to
observe that only the determining of
rational behavior occurs in all three types
of decision-making. Yet man enjoys
making decisions even when the moves
are completely outlined for him in ad-
vance; it is the actual making of the
choice which is most interesting.
Therefore, we are led inexorably to
the conclusion that it is man's deciding
his own life which helps make it inter-
esting to him. Now it is time for the
social scientists to determine "why" man
prefers to make value judgments instead
of following a master plan developed
for him.
Why Vought Projects
Bring Out The Best
In An Engineer
At Vought, the engineer doesn't often
forget past assignments. Like all big
events, they leave vivid memories.
And it's no wonder
For here the engineer contributes to
history-making projects — among
them the record-breaking Crusader
fighter; the Regulus II missile, chosen
to arm our newest nuclear subs; and
the new fast-developing 1,500-plus-
mph fighter, details of which are still
classified.
The Vought engineer watches such
weapons take shape. He supervises
critical tests, and he introduces the
weapons to the men with whom they
will serve.
Engineers with many specialties share
these experiences. Today, for exam-
ple, Vought is at work on important
projects involving:
electronics design and manufacture
inertial navigation
investigation of advanced propulsion
methods
Much 5 configurations
Vought's excellent R&amp;D facilities
help the engineer through unexplored
areas. And by teaming up with other
specialists against mutual challenges,
the Vought engineer learns new fields
while advancing in his own.

ONE OF A SERIES
The Aerodynamicist
Who Test-Hopped Equations
There'd never been a fighter that could barrel at
more than 1,000 mph one minute and land on a carrier
the next. And, as a result, there was unusually keen ad-
vance interest in the flying qualities of the airplane
proposed by Chance Vought.
Jim Madden was more than curious. As an aero-
dynamic design specialist, he would help develop the
Crusader's handling qualities. His job began with wind
tunnel tests.
Jim converted tunnel information into a graphic
picture of static and dynamic forces affecting Crusader
stability. He used analog computers and equations of
motion to predict the build-up of forces during maneu-
vers. Hinge moments, loads, and required rates of con-
trol motion were determined and released to Servo-
mechanism and Product Design groups. Soon the
Crusader's stabilization and power control packages
began to take shape.
Jim's part in the project could have ended right
there. But Vought's control system simulator helped him
proceed to some thoroughgoing conclusions.
It duplicated the complete rod system and all servo-
mechanisms that would control the speedy new fighter.
In the simulator's cockpit, high above the Structures
Lab floor, Jim previewed control responses that test
pilots later would experience. Airplane responses to
Jim's rudder kicks and aileron movements were re-
corded on analog computers. Any inability of the
control system to position the aircraft during flight was
easier to spot . . . and, with test and design engineers
on hand . . . easier to correct.
"It was like a big schematic — only better," says
Jim of the simulator.
"It gave me a chance to work with the whole
system.
"And actually watching aircraft responses to the
controls gave me a feeling for how fast they happen."
Another thing that moved fast was Crusader devel-
opment. Vought's simulator and other facilities detected
problems before they compounded. The fighter reached
operational readiness in record time.
Research, design and test facilities
at Chance Vought allow the
engineer to do a thorough job in
advanced problem areas . . .
assure high reliability in Vought-
developed weapon systems.

by JAMES STEVENS
NOW that 1957 is drawing to a close
and next year's car models have all
been acclaimed by their manufacturers
as the very last word in automotive
design, let us turn back the pages of
motoring propaganda twenty-five years
and present the "1933 Automobile Pre-
view" as it appeared in the January 1933,
issue of the Technic.
Chevrolet
"To motor minded people the holiday
period means not only the usual routine
ume sales, introduced its new, much more
smartly designed models in the middle
of December. Conventional streamlining
through the bulk of the body with defi-
nite tendencies towards tear-drop design
in the front and rear-end have added
much to its slender rakish beauty. Skirted
fenders and an extended rear body panel
have screened from vision the ugly lines
of frame structure and have made the
car more than a momentary delight to
the eye.
"A lengthened stroke has stepped the
both static and dynamic residual forces.
The engine rests on a sub-frame with
four points of support and the whole of
its weight is carried on the two lateral
supports so located that the motor is
balanced on its center of gravity. The
front and rear supports carry no engine
weight but function as stabilizers for the
engine's "fore and aft" pitch. In ihis
position the engine rotates about its own
principal axis.
"To improve the engine's operating
performance there are two notable

of gay events but also the serious busi-
ness of previewing the auto manufac-
turers' latest models. A more serious and
scrutinizing previewing than ever before
has begun, aand the blankets of fine
advertising will be removed in order
that Mr. Prospective Buyer can say to
himself, 'I have matched my dollar's
value.' For all this the manufacturer has
prepared himself and his product.
"Chevrolet, a consistent leader in vol-
speed up to a maximum well over 70
m.p.h., and has increased the horsepower
rating to a maximum of 65 at 800 r.p.m.
Innovations are numerous and are de-
cidedly marked advances in the auto-
motive engineering field. Outstanding
among the new features in the 'Cushion-
balanced" motor mounting or "stanamic
balancer.' The latter name comes from
the fact that the new mounting effective-
ly dampens out all vibrations set up by
achievements. A two-way automatic
vacuum-operated control on the distrib-
utor provides accurate spark adjustment
for all loads; and in order to produce
the proper combustible for firing regard-
less of the grade of gasoline being used,
the Chevrolet engineers have developed
an octane selector which advances or
retards the spark until the proper com-
bustion occurs within the chamber. An
automatic thermostat has been added to

keep the engine at constant temperature."
Buick
"The less depressed of the motoring
public in its naturally conserative mood
will view with pleasure the Buick offer-
ings for the current year. Although there
is nothing startlingly new about the
product there are enough improvements
to allow the car to retain its usual high
esteem before all car owners. Adding
extreme.
"An increased tread and a lengthened
wheelbase have made it possible to lower
the center of gravity a full two inches,
thus improving reliability at higher
speeds. A five point power plant mount-
ing insulated with rubber grommets and
pads has been developed along with a
cross reinforced frame to give the great-
est degree of automatic inertia type shock
absorbers controlled by floating valves
trols the engagement of the clutch
insuring smooth pick-up and instantan-
eous change from free wheeling to con-
ventional drive. By employing ball
detents instead of plungers, the silent-
second gear shifting arrangement has
been improved considerably. A starter
button has replaced the old style floor
pedal and new headlights which direct
a beam on the right hand edge of the
pavement have been installed to replace

pears to have been the most notable
achievement of its makers. By skirting
the fenders, slip-streaming the back panel
and air-stream styling the body from
bumper to bumper, the body designers
have achieved the modern without being
actuated by the movement of the chassis
are claimed to maintain riding comfort
over all roads at high speed.
"The automatic clutch, or "wizard
control" introduced last year, has been
improved by the addition of a new
pendulum valve that automatically con-
the present standard single beam lights.
"Ever since the advent of closed cars,
motorist, in order to enjoy fresh air,
have been obliged to endure the dis-
comforts of drafts blowing upon them
or to remain with windows closed and
endure the unhealthfulness of stuffy air

ventilation was made and Buick now
offers "no-draft ventilation." By placing
a pane of glass that is free to be moved
about a vertical axis at the front of each
side window gentle currents of fresh air
are continually conduced within the car
without producing noticeable drafts. This
feature, although detracting somewhat
from the finished beauty of the car,
should be a helpful selling factor."
Packard
"This building of the finer type of
motor car transportation, made inter-
nationally famous by its recent achieve-
ment in supplying a successful power
plant for Gar Wood's Miss America Xth,
has scored another impressive hit by
presenting the most conservative stream-
lined cars in the recent New York Auto
Show, the Eight, the Super Eight, and
advantages of two separate carburators
without the necessity of maintaining finely
balanced adjustments.
"Another unique mechanical improve-
ment on the new Packards for 1933 is
the application of the Bendix-BK
vacuum-operated power brake system, a
braking system that is positive in action,
and when brakes are applied for instant
emergencies the driver does not experi-
ence a swerving of the car — the drum
pressure on all four brake drums is
evenly and automatically controlled.
"In brief, other improvements added
to this new group are, three point engine
mountings, more rigid connecting rods
with cooling fins, a better system of
cylinder back pressure, dual coils for
positive ignition at high speeds, im-
proved syncro-mesh transmission with
very quiet operating gears at all four
speeds, and lastly but not of lesser
ing low priced cars, but they have
embodied many interesting mechaniol
features into this smartly designed car
With a low price range beginning at
S695.00, this new car will no doubt
make a strong showing in the medium-
low priced group for 1933.
"One of the main body improvements
to be found in this new line is the
deluxe appearance of the interiors. The
upholstery is very pleasing and well
contoured to afford greater seating com-
fort. All interior trim is of the panel
type and finished in two distinctive tones.
"A fine work in highly decorative
design is exemplified on the new De-
Soto's instrument panel. Its centerpiece is
an extra large speedometer.
"Mechanically the cars have many new
features. Noteworthy features are the
new automatic choke, manifold heat
control, a better transmission equipped

the Twin Six.
"The Eight and the Super Eight have
been stepped up in horse power from
110 to 135 to 120 and 145 respectively
. . . the twin six develops 160 horse-
power. The mechanical factor largely
responsible for this increased power is
the adoption of a new dual-downdraft
carburation system that gives all the
importance is the greatly improved shock
absorber action which gives absolute ride
control when necessary on traveling over
rough roads."

created for the motor buying public this
year not only one of America's outstand-

haust valve seats that prolong the time
before valve grinding becomes necessary.
"The power plant has a one eight inch
greater stroke than last year's engine,
and its new dimensions are 3^4 by 4%.
It develops 79 h.p. at 3600 r.p.m. with a

Here we go again with another batch
of headaches; these ought to last the
better part of the month, with the re-
maining period reserved for cerebral
entangling.
For our first one let us dip into the
annals of history, emerging with a
question suitable for prospective shep-
herds:
Herachles, the mightly one, questioned
Poimane about the number of his herds.
The reply came "About the stream Udata
are half of them, the twelfth portion
encompass the fields of Orous Hill, an
eighth of them dance on the banks of
the river Potamon, the thirtieth remain
back in the Land of Aznion, while the
twentieth portion feed on the vines of
Ampdoz. Still with me you see my re-
maining fifty herds. Heracles guessed
(being a poor math student) he had
87.5 herds. How many did Poimane
really have? (Where did Poimane get
his mathematic's education?)
If that problem is all Greek to you
try to reason out the following con-
versation.
"Hello, is this NO 3-3025?"
"Yes, who is calling, please?"
"You don't recognize my voice? You

Synthane laminated plastics report for work
Primed circuit for popular television receiver
uses a metal-clad Synthane Laminate. Such a
circuit eliminates wiring, wiring errors, saves
space and weight.
Since the time when the heart of radio was
the crystal and cat's whisker, Synthane
laminated plastics have been the recom-
mended insulation in the vital and ever
expanding communications industry.
Turn on your TV or radio and Syn-
thane goes to work as insulation in coil
forms, transformers, tuners, plug-ins,
switches, potentiometers, or as the
metal-clad base for the entire printed
circuit. Synthane also qualifies for im-
portant work in radar, sonar and guided
missile applications.
Among the varieties of Synthane lam-
inated plastics are several with insula-
tion resistance and dissipation factor ca-
pable of controlling TV's high frequencies
—even under tropically humid conditions.
But Synthane makes over 30 grades—
each with its own proportion of useful
mechanical, electrical and chemical vir-
tues. You can buy Synthane laminated
plastics in sheet, rod and tube form or
avail yourself of our complete fabrica-
tion service.
We have a number of interesting and
informative folders on Synthane proper-
ties and applications. A post card will
bring them to you promptly. Synthane

of the librarian. The library should be
added to distribution lists so that new
issues are received and filed promptly
after publication.
Catalogs may be conveniently filed al-
phabetically by manufacturer's name.
Large, bound catalogs are easily stored on
shelves; single sheets and pamphlets may
be stored in pamphlet boxes. In this way
individual items may be withdrawn di-
rectly without recourse to a card file.
Index cards enormously increase the
usefulness of the file but also add to the
cataloging work load. Cards are filed by
subjects or products similar to those used
by Thomas' Register or Sweet's. Under
each subject heading cards should include
a list of manufacturers' names, trade
names, and identifying dates and bulletin
numbers.
While this and other more complex sys-
tems may seem burdensome to set up and
maintain, without adequate control catalog
files quickly degenerate into disorganized
and misfiled stacks of paper. A small Ii-

brary can handle the job with a minimum
of engineering supervision, but it takes
time and attention of an already over-
loaded librarian. Management must recog-
nize the value of this service and provide
funds and qualified employees to do it
properly.
Buyers' guides arc helpful when a class
of product is needed but a specific manu-
facturer not known. Thomas' Register of
American Manufacturers is published an-
nually by the Thomas Publishing Co.,
and costs $15.00. It lists manufacturers al-
phabetically and subdivides them accord-
ing to product. Trade names are also
listed.
Street's Catalog Service, a division of
F. W. Dodge Corporation, annually issues
six bound and classified collections of
manufacturers' catalogs. The Product De-
sign File contains catalogs grouped under
the following seven major product classi-
fications; metals; plastics, rubber; wood,
glass, other materials, finishes; electrical
parts; power transmission; mechanical
parts and services; fasteners and ad-
hesives.
Three other collections, or Files, hav.
catalogs which are used by other indus-
trial buyers: the Plant Engineering Fil:
for plant maintenance and engineering
the Machine Tool Catalogs, for the selec-
tion and purchase of production machin-
ery and accessory equipment; and the In-
dustrial Construction File. All Files ar;
distributed, without charge, to individual*
in firms which meet established qualifying
standards.
The Electronics Buyers' Guide is in an-
nual supplement sent free to subscriber*
of Electronics magazine. Individual copis
are available for $3.00 per copy plus a
mailing charge. This guide includes re-
printed articles from the regular monthlj
publication, an index to electronics manu-
facturers by product, trade name, manu-
facturer and manufacturers' representa-
tives.
Government Publications
Federal specifications, standards and
the like are probably the greatest single
source of printed matter on technical sub-
jects.

by BARRY PEEBLES, '60E
Visible signs of the new philosophy of engineering education
arise on North Campus — more labor — atones where practice
can be correlated with theory.
The dedication of two new engineer-
ing laboratories on Michigan's North
Campus in October marked not only the
first move in the College of Engineering's
shift to the beautiful 1000 acre site but
also initiated a new concept in engi-
neering education at the University.
In the past, engineering schools have
developed along the lines of individual
departments, each with its own curricu-
lum, its own laboratories and its own
students. Today, as the broad scientific
principles which underlie the activities
of practicing engineers are ever more
widely applied, it is becoming clear that
there is a constantly expanding area of
scientific information and experience
common to all of the different branches
of engineering. As a consequence, the
College of Engineering has recognized
the common interests of the various
engineering departments and has planned
a series of laboratories suited to the
application of basic concepts to particular
areas of engineering activities. In these
laboratories students from all the engi-
neering curriculums can work together
toward the solution of common problems.
The first building to be dedicated with
this new concept in mind was the Morti-
mer E. Cooley Laboratory for engineering
research. Early in 1958 the University
will complete construction of the second
in this group, a new Fluid Engineering
Laboratory. Since every student spends
sometime studying the properties and
behavior of fluids this second building
especially fits this new concept.
The North Campus is not going to
become just a group of generalized
laboratories, however. This was empha-
sized last October with the dedication of
the Automotive Engineering Laboratory
and the Aeronautical Engineering Labor-
atory. Also in the planning stage are
such specialized buildings as a Highway
Engineering Laboratory, a Sanitary Engi-
neering Laboratory as well as class room
and office buildings.
Besides just a lot of beautiful new
buildings, all this will mean engineering
educational facilities unequaled anywhere
in the world. Each building is being or
was planned and designed to accommodate
the most up-to-date equipment available.
This is self-evident after a look around
the new Auto and Aero Labs. The Col-
lege of Engineering, with the aid of
private industry, has provided nothing
but the latest and best. This includes
everything from dynamometers and a
jet engine in the Auto lab to the wind
tunnels which have been in use since
early 1956 in the Aero Lab.
Yes, the North Campus will mein
something more to the student than just
a lot of new buildings. This is true
mainly because all of these equipment-
laden laboratories along with the ne»
concept in engineering education ire
aimed at just one purpose: to educate
the world's best engineers.
The Aeronautical Laboratory is one of the newly dedicated laboratories
on the North Campus.

progress in our understanding of world
weather and climate. This will be helped
also by the oceanographic researches,
which will moreover increase our knowl-
edge of the influences that affect our
food supply from the oceans.
Further, a world-wide survey of the
glaciers will help, with similar future
surveys to ascertain whether the frozen
water of the globe is steadily increasing
or decreasing, or undergoing only short
period fluctuations. A survey of the
natural and artificial radioactive contents
of the air and oceans will fulfill similar
and other purposes.
Scientific activity in the Antarctic will
reach unprecedented heights, at enormous
cost to the dozen or so nations engaged
in it. In that region there will be notable-
increases in geographical knowledge,
though this is only an incidental ob-
jective. Meteorological knowledge, espe-
cially concerning the southern hemis-
phere, will greatly benefit.
The sun will be more closely under
view than ever before, because of its
influence on the ionosphere — the
"electrical" region of the atmosphere
from 40 miles up — and thereby on
radio and telegraphic communications.
The ionosphere will be intensively stud-
ied, and also the cosmic rays that con-
tinually bombard the earth. The earth's
magnetism and the polar lights are in
the same group of sun-influenced phen-
omena. There is an elaborate organiza-
tion for predicting periods when sun-
forms will affect the earth, and for
alerting observers all over the globe for
intensified observations at such times.

Exploring Rockets
Among the outstanding research in
strumcnts to be used during the LG.Y.
are the rockets that will briefly explore
the high atmosphere, and the satellites
to be launched by the United States and
the U.S.S.R., into orbits at still higher
levels and of much longer occupation
These and the Antarctic expeditions ire
the most costly parts of the I.G.Y.
enterprise. The world has lately been
thrilled by the USSR launching of a
trial satellite (not in their IGY pro-
gram). Further USSR and USA satellites
can now be confidently expected.
All the I.G.Y. nations will pool their
observations. Some will publish much of
their data. Three complete sets of the
common store will be kept, one in the
United States, one in the U.S.S.R., and
one will be shared between several other
countries. From these centers copies will
be available at cost to scientists every-
where. Many important results will be
gained during and shortly after the
I.G.Y., but the full rewards will be
gathered only after many years of study
A new journal, of limited life, the
ANNUALS OF THE INTERNATION
AL GEOPHYSICAL YEAR, is recording
the history, organization, programs and
methods of the I.G.Y., and will later
contain many of the results, and cata-
logues of the data available.
The I.G.Y. is now in progress. Not
all has begun according to plan; there
have been and are delays in starting some
items of the program in some places.
But by and large the work is doing well
And the sunspot maximum expected to
occur during the I.G.Y. has more than
fulfilled expectations. Some scientists
thought that this sunspot maximum
would be of only moderate intensity
Actually it may rival or perhaps ex-
ceed the greatest of the past. This
should help to maximize the gains of
knowledge of the sun's influence upon
the earth, from the concerted program
of many kinds of observations of the
earth during the I.G.Y.

Where reliability is the watchword
JENKINS VALVES were selected
Reliability has characterized Sikorsky Helicopters
throughout a long record of military and commercial
service. A watchword in the building of these versa-
tile airplanes, reliability also was made the critical
measure of all equipment for the 18-acre Sikorsky
plant recently completed in Stratford, Conn.
On the valves to control much of the complex net-
work of pipelines, management, architects, engineers
and contractors found it easy to agree. From long
experience on many jobs all could be sure of the
reliability of Jenkins Valves.
This confidence in the specification "Jenkins", has
been shared by building experts and plant operating
men alike for 93 years. The valves that have won this
great confidence bear the Jenkins Diamond trade-
mark . . . and they cost no more. Jenkins Bros.,

A woman was being followed by a
man. She started to walk faster and
thought she had eluded him. When she
got home she locked the door and felt
safe. But when she suddenly looked
around, there he was right in the house.
"You've got a nerve to follow me. If
my husband came home right now he'd
kill you. You don't know what a man
my husband is. He'd kill you.
Just then they heard a key in the door.
"Where'll I go?" the man said.
"In the wardrobe closet."
The husband came in and embraced
his wife.
"Gee, how I missed you while I was
on the road, darling," he said.
Then he heard something in the closet.
He opened the door and saw the man.
"You dirty rat!" he snarled. Haven't
I seen you someplace before?"
"Yes, in my house in Pittsburgh.
That makes us even."

This student is observing the structures of a new super alloy for aircraft gas
turbines, using the electron microscope. At this magnification of 20,000 diameters,
it is possible to determine the action of the fine structures which lead to high strengths.
The course in metallurgical engineering is based upon a foundation in the basic
sciences of chemistry, physics and mathematics followed by sequences in process and
physical metallurgy. In process metallurgy the extraction of metal from the ore, as well
as the melting and refining reactions in liquid metal are studied.
In physical metallurgy, new alloys are developed by changing the metal structure
to meet engineering requirements of strength, hardness, toughness, wear resistance or
resistance to elevated temperatures.
Because of this valuable background, metallurgists are in great demand in practi-
cally every industry which processes or uses metals.

Did you ever hear
atoms move?
The physicist positions a single crystal of age-hardened
steel under the sharp diamond penetrator. He touches
a pedal, and the pyramidal tip of the diamond squeezes into
the polished surface of the steel.
The instant that it touches, things begin to happen inside the
crystal. Atoms begin to slip and slide, in layers. Some layers
abruptly wrinkle and corrugate. If you listen hard when this
happens, you hear a faint, sharp, "click." This is the sound
of atoms suddenly shifting within the crystal.
You can see the action, too—or, rather, the results of it.
The photomicrograph above shows the characteristic ridge:
and ripples. The black diamond in the center is the depres
sion made by the penetrator.
By studying these patterns, and correlating the information
with other data, scientists at U. S. Steel are trying to learn
what happens atomically when a steel is bent, flexed or
broken. Thus, they try to develop new and better steels for an
exacting and ever-growing steel market.
Research is only one area in which we need high-level scien-
tific personnel. Partly, this is due to the fact that men progress
so rapidly at United States Steel. Remember these figures:
among the 20,000 members of our management team, 99%

Winning Pledge Essay for the Fall,
1957, Pledge Class of Tau Beta Pi.
The engineering student has become somewhat of a quaint curiosity, generally ostracized on American
college compuses. Liberal Art students regard the engineer as an uncouth, uncultured lump of pro-
toplasm personified by a shuffling pair of soiled khakis topped off by a bright orange shalaili known as a
slide rule, a mutation of the abacus. This martyr has long borne this abuse silently, primarily because his
time has been more than adequately consumed by his studies, leaving little with which to ridicule others.
Let me reverse the process, if only momentarily, to reveal a few shaky foundations and considerable glass
in the stone throwers' houses.
First of all, let me make a few concessions. Granted: the Liberal Arts student obtains a more
"rounded", liberal education (hence the name); the average Liberal Arts student has greater familiarity
with the arts (hence the name). But are we judging by antiquated standards?
The "liberal", well rounded person of the future may very well be the one who can comprehend,
due to his scientific training, the great technological advances in space, communications, medicine, chemis-
try, etc. All others will view these as incomprehensiblities to be taken on faith, faith in the scientist and
the engineer. The Renaissance may have been a revolution in the arts but its effects seem paltry com-
pared to the effect on society due to such things as the atom and space exploration.
The "well rounded" education of today is certainly desirable but it is inconsequential in so far
as material matters are concerned. Imagine wars being waged over a particularly inspiring painting by
Dali, a stimulating play by Marilyn's husband, or a beautiful poem by Frost. The material things of
life are in the hands of those who are the most advanced technologically.
The arts are solely emotive in nature. They provide entertainment and are totally non-utilitarian.
They cannot affect us physically in any way or to any extent.
Science, on the other hand, directly affects each and every one of us individually and each and ever)'
nation as a whole. Even the inoffensive nations of the mid-Pacific are not immune.
The effect of science is both emotional and physical. There are two holes in Japan as a direct re-
sult of an odd-ball's equation and many fish find themselves incapable of fertilizing their cavier. The
emotional appeal of science cannot be deemphasized either. The largest voice of propaganda enumerates
through the earth toward needles which jump across strips of paper before the bloodshot eyes of dis-
gruntled foreign observers. Science affects all six senses.
And still the Liberal Arts student condemns the student of technology. It is interesting to note that,
even after the "well rounded" student graduates, he continues to retard progress by over-emotional think-
ing in our congress. Our congressmen are, by and large, Liberal Arts graduates. They do not consider a
budget sufficient to initiate and maintain creative research as essential and concern themselves with emo-
tive problems such as racial integration and campaigning. While these machinations are going on,
our enemies calculate to dominate us; they integrate mathematically to differentiate us physically into
infinitesimal masses, dm.
I am whole heartedly for culture, but I am strictly against the general deprecation of the technologi-
cal mind. Give me culture but give me the well being with which to enjoy it.

ENGINEERS IN MANAGEMENT
The engineer has long since proven his value
as an executive. What many people fail to
recognize is that it is his background in applied
engineering that contributes for the most part
to his adaptability.

Possibly the dominant key to our
economy today is the high increase
in consumer purchasing power which has
occurred since World War II. Regardless
of how fast purchasing power rises, the
consumer's money and credit will not
let him buy all he would like at any
time. Therefore, he must be selective
and choose from what is available those
goods and services which give him the
most satisfaction. This creates the in-
tense composition we see on all sides
for the consumer's dollar. Together with
increasing military needs, this, in turn,
is the driving force behind more and
more research and development, which
has created the tremendous need for engi-
neers in industry.
Engineers are an integral part of the
management team. As industry becomes
more and more technological it requires
increasingly large investments in plants,
thereby placing added responsibilities on
the engineer. An important responsibility
of top management, therefore, is to
create a climate that will foster maximum
use of the engineer's managerial skills.
I plan to give you a picture of how we
are going about this by developing the
following:
1. The need for engineers in my busi-
ness.
2. The opportunities we have for engi-
neers to advance anywhere in the busi-
ness.
3. What we expect of engineers as
managers and supervisors,
4. Some problems we find in de-
veloping engineers to become managers
and supervisors.
5. How we expose these problems
with attitude research and measurement.
6. What we are doing to solve them
and how it is paying off.
Our business is highly technical and
is becoming increasingly so through the
introduction of technological improve-
ments such as electronic switching of
calls, improved microwave systems, mech-
anized accounting, and many others just
over the horizon. Each provides a chal-
lenge to our people, and each provides
opportunities for the individual to de-
velop and to advance in the system.
The increasing complexity of our busi-
ness requires greater emphasis on oper-
ations research, which, in the last an-
alysis, is the determination of the best
way to do a job out of many possible
combinations. It is the skill of the engi-
neer that will be needed more and more
to fully realize the potentialities of the
things we see ahead.
There are in the Bell System some
12,000 graduate engineers of which near-
ly 7,000 are with the telephone operating
companies. About 3,000 of these are in
the engineering departments, and the
balance in operating and staff functions
in the other departments. Thus there is a
large field for graduate engineers in de-
partments other than engineering. Of the
remaining 5,000 about 2,000 are with the
Bell Telephone Laboratories, to a large
JANUARY, 1958

research rather than operational problems,
and some 3,000 are with the Western
Electric Company. The American Tele-
phone and Telegraph Company headquar-
ters organization has over 200 graduate
engineers.
In order to care for the increasing mag-
nitude of the engineering job in the Bell
Operating Companies, the number of engi-
neering positions has increased about 30
per cent during the past three years or
about 10 per cent per year. In view of
this large growth it would be expected
that many engineers naturally would be in
position to advance to supervisory jobs.
I have a chart—"Management Distri-
bution by Education—District Level and
Above—Bell Telephone Companies"—
which you might find of interest. You
will note in all Bell System middle and
higher management jobs (third level of
supervision and up) approximately 59
per cent of the individuals involved are
college graduates, of which about two-
fifths (2,200) have engineering degrees.
The chart also shows the absence of a
degree by no means precludes a man's
reaching a high management position—
about 41 per cent of the people in middle
and higher management are not college
graduates. A number of these people are
in engineering jobs.
With reference to top management,
that is, those above department head
(chief engineer is a department head),
better than one out of four of the in-
cumbents have an engineering degree.
The highly technical nature of our busi-
ness has made it necessary that a sub-
stantial proportion of higher manage-
ment have the analytical type of mind
that goes with an engineering back-
ground.
What We Expect of Engineers as
Managers and Supervisors
It is necessary that engineers have
technical competence, but as we draw on
so many engineers to fill higher man-
agement jobs, it is also necessary that
those chosen have the characteristics re-
quired to enter the ranks of higher man-
agement.
Merle Thorpe, in the A.M.A. Man-
agement Renew of February, 1954,
pointed out four common denominators
that characterize the kind of manager
I have in mind. They are:
1. Ability to visualize—to see the com-
pleted project before the first step is
taken.
2. Ability to organize—to marshal
human resources to get things done in
the most efficient and economical man-
neer.
3. Ability to deputize—to get the right
man for the right job.
4. Ability to supervise—the quality of
arousing teamwork; to make each man
on the team feel that his part is as im-
portant as any other.
I would like to spell out these ability
characteristics in more detail. As I see
them in the engineer, they are:
1. Technical competence—knowledge
of the engineering tools required to do
his job.
2. Intellectual integrity—upper man-
agement must have confidence in his
work.
3. Good oral and written expression
—convincing presentation of his recom-
mendations.
4. Know how to deal with people—
team operation is required to get all the
factors bearing on a problem.
5. Sound judgment—to select the best
of several possible solutions—to know
how exacting a job is necessary.
6. Understanding of economics—re-
quired for decision making.
7. Inquisitiveness—he must have the
drive to originate.
8. Perseverance — to see things
through.
In general, these point up what we all
know are the characteristics required of
a good manager anywhere, whether he
be an engineer or not. As you know,
it's quite another problem to find people
who have these characteristics. However,
by working in the right climate on the
day-to-day job, people can be developed
—engineers as well as others—to be bet-
ter managers.
Problems in Developing Engineers to
Become Managers and Supervisors
Certain characteristics which engineers
tend to acquire result first from their
type of education, and second, from their
work environment once they enter busi-
ness. They are taught the practical ap-
proach to things—to keep their feet on
the ground. Their concentration is with
material things rather than people. As a
result, even the experienced engineer
sometimes doesn't look beyond the purely
technical aspects of his job. Success of a
product requires, for example, that mar-
ketability be as important a factor is
workability.
When the latest model telephone »is
designed, the numbers and letters were
placed on the outside of the dial rather
than on the inside where they had ken
on earlier models. A market test of the
new telephone soon showed that our
customers couldn't dial quickly and ac-
curately to the degree required until i
tiny white target dot was placed in the
blank spaces inside the dial holes.
There seems to be a tendency in busi-
ness to organize line departments into
geographic divisions broadly administra-
tive in character, at least at management
levels, and to organize engineering de-
partments into functional or specialty
groups in order to foster expertness and
creativity.
When engineers enter business thev
are frequently placed in an organizational
environment of the latter type, where the
basis for promotion has been largely
technical competence. In a large organi-
zation there could be three levels or"
supervision between the engineer who
has been assigned a particular job and
the department head, the Chief Engineer,
each level represented by a technical
expert.
With that type of organizational strut
ture, as a project proceeds upwards in
the organization, each level of supervi-
sion may, if it chooses, analyze it from
an expert's point of view. If this is done,
it can produce the following:
a. The supervisor continues to do de-
tailed engineering work rather than dele-
gate.
b. The engineer at the bottom of the
ladder becomes bogged down getting in-
formation that he thinks might be perti-
nent so as not to take any chance before-
passing a job along. This impairs any
feeling of proprietorship and has a tre-
mendous bearing on morale and per-
formance.
C. A departmental point of view in-
stead of a company one. Factors not
readily susceptible to dollars and cent'
measurement may be disregarded.
d. Impairment of communications up
and down the line.
The engineering organizational struc-
ture can have a definite bearing on en-
gineering quality—as well as on morale
The size of an engineering organization,
of course, can be an important factor in
this respect. However, irrespective of
16

problems such as these must be squarely
faced to provide good engineering super-
vision.
The Western Society of Engineers
canvassed a group of industrial leaders
a few years ago to get their views as to
the deficiencies they saw in the engineers
they employ. Of the many replies re-
ceived, I'd like to quote from one as it
mentions several of the characteristics
we expect of engineers as managers.
"In general I think the great majority
of our managers feel that engineers are
well prepared for engineering manage-
ment from the standpoint of technical
knowledge and engineering skills. Al-
though the deficiencies of engineers
are no greater than those other profession-
al groups, engineers are short on business
knowledge, management techniques, and
human relations skills. In most engineer-
ing problems, economic factors loom
large in the final decision. In industry
the engineer must be a businessman as
well as a scientist. The trend toward
specialization in industry has presented
problems in developing men for manage-
ment. The engineer who is highly spe-
cialized in one field has difficulty in
striking a balance in dealing with the
multitude of problems with which he
is confronted, for he has the tendency to
think along the lines of his own spe-
cialty."
Attitude Research and Management
A central management objective in
the Engineering Department is to make
sure that when an engineer has people
reporting to him he is a skilled super-
visor as well as a good engineer. No
organization can contribute its full share
toward the success of the enterprise
without supervisors who really under-
stand their people. We have done exten-
sive research on the relationship be-
tween supervisors and subordinates and
find that the good boss, especially the
human side of him, is the most impor-
tant working condition. The supervis-
or's attitude is the chief incredient of
the social skill he needs to be a good
boss. Attitudes—both of supervision and
the rank and file—are relatively easy to
measure.
We have made several surveys of
management people, each consisting of
over 100 questions covering 17 principal
categories. In addition, we have a cate-
gory called the "General Management At-
titude" which is composed of certain
questions in the other categories and
which provides a single measure of the
more general aspects of attitude. Spon-
taneous answers are sought to the ques-
tions rather than ones that are carefully
thought out.
For example, an important category
is "Attitude Toward Supervision." Some
typical questions are:
a. Do you think that your supervisor
would give you a fair hearing on any
subject you would want to bring up?
** Always
♦Usually
Seldom
Never
**An "always" answer gets full credit
for the question.
*A "usually" answer gets half credit.
Other answers get no credit.
b. How do you feel about the amount
of appreciation and recognition you get
when you do a good job?
**Entirely satisfied
*Quite satisfied
Only fairly satisfied
Not at all satisfied
c. How much real interest does your
supervisor have in you as a person?
None at all
Not very much
♦Quite a bit
**A great deal
The answers, which are anonymous,
obviously are not precise. They do, how-
ever, represent the real feelings of
people. We have gone back and made
checks of the questionnaire answers by
conducting personal interviews on a ran-
dom basis. The substance of the inter-
views checked with what he had found
from the anonymous questionnaires.
Numerical score on an attitude sur-
vey is relatively unimportant because no
one knows what is par. A comparison
between different groups and a study of
the trends are highly significant and
point the way to intelligent action.
I have a chart which shows the scores
of an Engineering Department in each
of the 18 categories. The Attitude Sur-
vey was taken in 1952. The zero line on
the chart represents the total System
results equated to a norm. (See page 8.)
You will note the Engineering scores
were well below the zero line in the cate-
gories of Confidence in Management,
Pride in Company, Job Satisfaction, Per-
sonal Satisfaction, Attitude Toward Sup-
ervision, Communications, Identification
with Management, and General Manage-
ment Attitude.
Also, I have the scores of an Operat-
ing Department where the management
people are predominantly male. The
Operating Department includes some
graduate engineers. By superimposing
one set of scores on the other it can be
seen that the over-all General Manage-
ment Attitude, as well as Confidence in
Management Pride in Company, job
Satisfaction, Personal Satisfaction and
Identification with Management, was
higher in the Operating Department than
in the Engineering Department.
You will note that financial knowl-
edge in the Engineering Department was
substantially higher than in the Operat-
ing Department. This is what we might
expect due to the fact that the Engineer-
ing organization is responsible for the
economics of plant investment.
In addition, I have scores of the total
Company in the 18 categories. These
scores represent the results for all man-
agement personnel. You can see here, as
with the Operating Department, the
over-all General Management Attitude,
as well as Job Satisfaction, Personal
Satisfaction, Pride in Company, Confi-
dence in Management and Identification
with Management, ran higher than in
the Engineering Department.
In addition to the questions, the At-
titude Survey Questionnaires contain
space for written-in comments. Many of
the comments give us good leads as to
where action is desirable. I would like
to quote a few of the critical com-
ments made by members of the Engi-
neering Department because they illus-
trate dramatically the problems of mak-
ing good engineers into good supervis-
ors. For the record I would like to point
out we also get many favorable com-
ments.
Communications Are Important
"I've had three jobs canceled in the
last six months, I don't know why they
were canceled, my boss doesn't know,
I can't ask him because the guy above
him doesn't know or won't tell him.
I think that's one of the biggest things
you have to overcome, is to tell a man
why."
"The Section Heads go to meetings
on various jobs. They get all the infor-
mation . . . but nothing ever comes down

SMALL TREES-THEIR STRENGTH
A discussion of the tests and their re-
sults used to determine how the prop-
erties of wood from small second-
growth trees compare with that from
large old-growth trees.
PROPERTIES
Change and progress are the life
blood of the forest industry. No
company, corporation, or area can stand
still for long. In less than three decades
the use of small trees for structural lum-
ber has grown, through necessity, from
nothing to millions of board feet per
year. To the forest industry in many parts
of the East this has meant a gradual
change from large mills equipped to
handle huge logs, to small bolter mills
equipped to convert large volumes of
small logs into lumber.
The Need for a New Testing Method
To the engineer using wood for struc-
tural purposes this change raises only one
question: is lumber taken from small
second-growth trees? This is a very im-
portant question because the very lives
of those using the lumber, or living or
working in the structures made from the
lumber depend on the answer. It is not
satisfactory to guess or to suppose that
lumber cut from small trees has the same
strength properties as lumber cut from
large old-growth timber. We must know
what the relationship is, and the uni-
versally accepted method of determining
the strength properties of small clear
specimens of wood will not tell us. This
method was initiated over fifty years ago
and uses a test-piece of 2-inch square
cross section which is much too large to
test the strength properties of the small
trees being used today. To accurately test
the smaller trees being used today a new
method using small test specimens was
developed.
The New Method
The procedure used in the accepted
method of determining strength proper-
ties is not questioned. Many tests have
shown that it gives accurate results. How-
ever, the orthopedic nature of wood
makes it impossible to cut specimens of
the standard size, from small diameter
trees (8"), having true radial and tangen-
tial planes. The strength varies consider-
ably with the plane of the wood so it is
important that specimens having true
tangential and radial faces be used. To
accomplish this, specimens 2 cm. square
in cross section were cut. These small
specimens were tested in exactly the same
way as the larger specimens* except that
the testing jigs and fixtures were on a
correspondingly smaller scale.
The Tests
The strength properties tested were:
1. cleavage,
2. hardness,
3. compression parallel to the grain,
4. static bending (modulus of elastic-
ity), and
5. shear parallel to the grain.
Load deflection diagrams are recorded
automatically in all tests until the speci-
men fails to support one-tenth of the
maximum load or until a deflection of 6
cm. is reached, whichever occurs first.
The cleavage specimen (Fig. 1) is

placed in the grips (Fig. 2) and pulled
apart by a standard testing machine. The
crosshead movement is 0.10 in./min.
Tests are made on some specimens cut so
as to give a failure along a radial sur-
face and on others cut to give a
failure along a tangential surface. The
maximum load causing failure in either
the radial or tangential direction is a
measure of the resistance of the timber
to splitting.
In the hardness test, the standard is
that used for the larger 2-in. specimen,
i.e. a hardened steel tool rounded to a
diameter of 0.444 in. (projected area 1
sq. cm.) The tool is embedded to one-
half the diameter on the side surface only
of the 2-cm test-piece. (Fig. 3) Side
splitting is avoided by clamping the speci-
men between distance pieces of the same
species in a jig to form a block of ap
proximately 2 in. square.
A special compression cage is used for
the small 2x2x6 cm. specimen. It
rests on the table of a universay testing
machine, the load is applied by the
moving crosshead through a ball con-
tact and plunger. The latter is fitted with
a fine clearance but is free to drop under
its own weight. The use of a compression
cage of this type ensures a uniform dis-
tribution of load over the cross-section of
the specimen. A rate of head descent of
0.024 in./min. is used for the test. The
property determined is the maximum
compressive strength parallel to the grain.
In the static bending test a specimen
2 x 2 x 30 cm. in length is supported over
a span of 28 cm. in trunnions carried on
18
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


center of the beam, the loading head,
with a radius of curvature of 15 mm.,
descending at a constant speed of 0.26
in./min. The orientation of annual rings
is parallel to the direction of loading.
The modulus of elasticity is computed
from the following formula:
PL
4Abd3
in which:
E = Modulus of elasticity (lbs. per sq.
cm.),
P = Load at proportional limit (lbs.)
L = Length of span between supports
cm.),
A = Deformation at proportional limit
cm.),
b = Width of specimen (cm.), and
d = Depth of specimen (cm.).
The test specimen (Fig. 4) is placed in
a special shearing tool with the projecting
lip under a sliding plate upon which the
load is applied at a rate of 0.015 inch per
minute. The maximum load only is ob-
served, and the shearing strength per
square cm. is found by dividing the maxi-
mum load by the shearing area.
Results of Tests
Five widely used species were tested
and compared with published values ob-
tained on specimens of inch-square cross-
section. The results, as tabulated in Table
1, show a very close correlation between
the methods. The species used were:
1. Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga taxifolia),
2. western red cedar (Thuja plicata),
3. western hemlock (Tsuga hetero-
phylla),
4. eastern white pine (Pinus strobus),
and
5. Norway spruce (Picea abies).
The new method has certain advantages
over the established method even when
used on large trees. In particular, it is
more suitable for the systematic samp-
ling of small and second growth trees
and for the preparation of matched
groups of test specimens for all com-
parative tests. Systematic sampling is ac-
complished by taking specimens from
all parts of a log. Some are taken near the
pith, some near the bark, and some at the
intersection of sapwood and heartwood.
On small logs it is often impossible to get
2-inch specimens from the area desired
and it is impossible to get any specimens
having true radial and tangential faces.
With 2-cm. specimens that is easily done.
Matched groups for comparative tests are
more easily secured with 2-cm. specimens
because it is much easier to avoid defects
and separate specimens are taken from
more nearly related material.
Conclusions
The new method developed for test-
ing the strength properties of small clear
specimens of wood using test pieces 2-cm
square in cross-section provides accurate
results, utilizes the same procedures as the
established method, and has certain ad-
vantages over the established method
when applied to small and second growth
timber.
To verify the results obtained in this
experiment more testing of the same
type should be carried out using a greater
number of samples and a more extensive
variety of species.

Our railroads take a leaf from
Lionel's book to improve speed
and multiply track capacity —
automatically.
The middle-aged fellow reached out
and flipped some levers on the con-
trol panel before him. Some distance
away, signal lamps changed color and
an electric switch snapped, directing a
diesel locomotive onto a siding. Minutes
later another train roared by at full
speed in the opposite direction. Another
change of the controls, and the first train
was back on the main line with unabated
speed. The middle-aged gentleman puffed
on his cigar and relaxed.
Playing with Junior's electric train? Re-
version to childhood? Not this time.
This gentleman is a train dispatcher,
moving very real 10,000 ton trains over
hundreds of miles of very real railroad,
His job entails setting all signals and
turning all switches along this stretch,
and he does so with the aid of an elec-
tronic remote controller system known as
centralized traffic control, or CTC.
Let us examine the development, appli-
cation, and economic impact of CTC
from the standpoint of being an easily-
understood modification of automation.
The months following the close of
World War II found the railroads of the
United States in economic hot water. The
tremendous demands of war traffic
through many years of minimum main-
tenance left the carriers a physical wreck.
The postwar wage-price spiral had com-
menced. The railroads, whose rates are
established by the slow-moving Inter-
state Commerce Commission, found them-
selves trapped between inflated costs
and static rates. In order to retain their
position as the basic transportation in-
dustry of the U. S., increased efficiency
of operation was necessary.
Diesel-electric locomotives provided a
temporary stopgap, replacing 20,000 in-
efficient steam locomotives in ten years.
However, railroaders felt that a more
basic economy was necessary. Some meas-
ure had to be taken to improve the fun-
damental efficiency of train operation.
The railroads had too much trackage
which carried too little traffic too slowly.
"Railroading has always mass-produced
transportation," thought industry leaders,
"So why not produce it automatically?"
Full steam ahead to the rescue came
CTC. In answer to top brass's prayers, it
made railroad operation nearly as simple
as running a new Lionel around the
Christmas tree, and by employing many
of the same principles.
For example, consider what must hap-
pen on a single-track railway when two
trains in opposite directions must pass at
a siding. The first train must stop before
the siding, open the switch, enter the sid-
ing, then stop again to close the switch.
Meanwhile, the second train must ap-
proach very slowly, since its crew cannot
be sure of the opposing train's position.
When train two finally passes train one,
train one crawls to the other end of the
siding, stops, opens the other switch,
regains the main line, and stops again
to close this switch behind it.
This tedious process involves up to
four complete stops for one train, a slow-
up to the other, and delays to any other
nearby trains. Meanwhile, fuel is burning
up, men and equipment are idle, and pas-
sengers are cussing about trains that start
and stop in the middle of nowhere. All
of this seems needless, considering the
ease with which such moves are made
with toy trains.
CTC machines permit the same move
to be safely made with only a small re-
duction in the speed of either train. The
dispatcher, who may closely follow train
progress by watching tiny lights move
across a track diagram, sets signals and
turns switches for the train crews. Much
stopping is eliminated, track capacity is
increased, and man-failure accidents are
generally eliminated.
How Has CTC Been Employed?
The Union Pacific installed 625 miles
of CTC, to completely equip its Los
Angeles-Salt Lake City single track. In
this territory, four through passenger
trains are operated daily. These include
the streamliner "City of Los Angeles'
which operates at an average speed of
70 m.p.h. Freight traffic averages twenty
to thirty trains daily, and consists largely
of perishables such as dressed meat, live-
stock, and fresh fruit and vegetables.
CTC has permitted these trains to aver-
age 40 m.p.h. in contrast with a national
average of about 20 m.p.h. Twenty-one
sidings were eliminated with the installa-
tion of CTC; the remaining sidings were
lengthened to hold at least 122 cars, and
some will hold 137 and 143 cars. A two-
to-three hour reduction in running time
eliminated two intermediate terminals
for engine crews and freight train crews.
All switches and signals for the first }24
miles are controlled by one dispatcher,
whereas three were needed for the old
train-order and block-signal system.
The New York Central has used CTC
to effect a reduction in the number of

tracks required. Four tracks and three
tracks have become two; double track is
replaced by single, when CTC is in-
stalled. Savings result from reduced
maintenance and a lower tax assessment,
although capacity is not affected, since
trains run faster and oftener on the
remaining tracks.
To save time and increase track ca-
pacity, the Santa Fe Railroad installed
CTC between Fresno, Calif., and Stock-
ton, a part of its busy San Francisco-
Chicago route. Freight trains save about
two hours on this 124-mile run.
How Does CTC Work?
Centralized traffic control is a term ap-
plied to a method of train dispatching by
signal indication. Principally, it is con-
cerned with giving trains permission to
proceed when unopposed, and with di-
recting them through sidings when neces-
sary to pass or overtake.
On single track, sidings up to two
miles in length are provided at intervals.
At each end is an electric switch (see il-
lustration 0'). Referring to illustration 0',
suppose that the train shown is south-
bound, and that it is about to pass a
northbound freight which is approach-
ing the siding from the end not shown.
Since the southbound train has passed
the switch and is still on the main track,
the northbound freight must take the
siding.
Note the three signals shown in illu-
stration 0'. Only signal "A" is visible to
our southbound train. Signal tower "A"
carries two targets, each with two lamps.
The upper target governs the main track,
therefore the dispatcher sets it green
("proceed full speed"). The lower target,
controlling the siding, is set at red
("your train will not take siding").
The dispatcher also sets the switch in the
normal, or "straight through" position
to correspond with signal "A"; the south-
bound enters the section of main track
bypassed by the siding.
Meanwhile, the northbound freight en-
counters another "signal A" at the south
end, this one showing "red over green."
This means that the main line (top target,
red) is occupied, and you are being
switched into the siding (bottom target,
green). The switch will be aligned ac-
cordingly, and the northbound freight
will pull alongside the southbound pas-
senger.
It may be well to interject at this point
that the dispatcher is prevented from
setting up any potentially dangerous com-
bination of signal and switch settings by
the machine itself, which is designed to
reject them.
To complete the move started above, it
is necessary to prevent either train from
reaching the end of the double-tracked
distance and attempting to proceed be-
fore the other train is clear of the switch
and the switch aligned to its track. This
is the job of signals "B" aand "C" which
like "A" are placed at each end of each
siding, but which face the double- rather
than the single-track portion. Dwarf sig-
nal "B" is red unless a train is being
ordered to leave the siding, when the dis-
patcher sets it green. Signal "C" operates
similarly for the main track. Note that
"B" and "C" are never green simul-
taneously!
When the southbound passenger first
sights signal "C" at the south end of
double track, it is red (let us suppose),
because the caboose of the slower freight
hasn't cleared the south switch. The pas-
senger coasts along, prepared to stop, but
the dispatcher reverses the switch quickly
after the caboose clears it and sets "C"
green. The passenger rolls on through the
switch, resuming speed.
Because the passenger was shorter and
faster, the northbound freight finds sig-
nal "B" green as soon as it becomes
visible, and does not even need to slow
down.
All trains automatically report their
positions by short-circuiting weak vol-
tages present in insulated sections of rail.
Wayside relay houses (see illustration
O") code these indications and send
them along a two-wire line to the CTC
master machine.
These wayside relay houses also con-
tain decoding relays to operate dozens
of switches and signals from pulsed data
on the same two wires.
What of the Future?
In the thirty years of its existence,
16,000 miles of CTC have been installed,
mostly since 1945. Presently the rate of
installation is 1600 to 2000 miles en-
nually. An anticipated downward trend
in installations has failed to develop due
to the development of modifications
which make installation profitable on less
densely-trafficked lines.
The future of CTC seems to be closely
linked with the future of railroading
itself. Railway signalmen have operated
crewless trains with extended CTC and
microwave radio. The Reading Railroad,
operating 3,250 miles of complicated
trackage, states that with control systems
already developed, it could operate its
entire system from one room in down-
town Philadelphia.

MATERIALS ENGINEERING
Materials are becoming more important in
industry each year, and so are the graduates
of Michigan's Materials Engineering curricu-
lum.
The materials engineering curriculum,
the only program of its type in the
country, is one of the newest and smallest
courses of study in the College of Engi-
neering, but its graduates are in more and
more demand by industry every year.
The materials engineering program,
which more or less "grew out" of the
Chem-Met department, came into being
about 1950-51, largely through the efforts
of the late Dean George Granger Brown
and Professor Richard Schneidewind. For
the last four years, however, the program
has been under the direction of Professor
Lawrence Van Vlack.
The main factor in the establishment
of the program was a demand by in-
dustry for graduates who can understand
the properties and behavior of all types
of material, and the purposes which they
must serve so that he may specify the most
satisfactory one for product application.
It has been pointed out that such recent
developments as gas turbines, rocket en-
gines, supersonic planes, high pressure
steam plants, electronic computers, and
color television have all required new
and previously unknown engineering ma-
terials. Many companies report that de-
signs are now being limited by present
materials. It is this demand that the Col-
lege of Engineering set out to fill seven or
eight years ago.
To meet this demand, courses have been
carefully selected from the Chemistry
and Chem-Met departments to give the
student an understanding of the under-
lying principles of different types of
materials. These principles would in-
clude utility, properties, application, and
control.
After taking basic physics, chemistry,
and mechanics courses, a student's work
is centered around three types of ma-
terials: metals and their alloys; bigb
polymers such as plastic, rubber, and ad-
hesives; and ceramics such as glass and
refractories. Concerning facilities for these
courses, Prof. Van Vlack reports they are
quite adequate. They will be even more
so once the next building to be built on
the North Campus, the Mechanics, Ma-
terials, and Structures Laboratory, is com-
pleted. Funds for the final architect s
plans are expected to be made available
this year, and the actual construction
should start in the near future.
No matter what course a student is
taking he often wonders just what kind
of work he will do after graduation. It
he's a materials engineer he will prob-
ably find himself in one of four rather
closely related groups.
The most likely type of job would be
that of material specification. This type of
engineer is particularly valuable in manu-
facturing plants where it is desirable to
replace present materials for the purpose
of improving the product, reducing costs,
reducing service failures, due to short-
ages of specific raw materials, or due to

increased demands made on the product.
This is the type of engineer that Pratt and
Whitney recently advertised for in the
Michigan Technic because "more power-
ful engines can not be developed until
better materials can be obtained."
A materials engineer might also find
himself working in product improvement.
He would be mainly concerned in selec-
tion and control of surface finishes used
on products to increase sales appeal and
to reduce deterioration from heat or cor-
rosion.
Product development is another area
for materials engineers. Industry is em-
ploying many men who have the training
and ingenuity to develop new and useful
products to be made of the material his
organization is manufacturing. Since this
type of work is basically research, a grad-
uate degree would be almost a necessity.
For this reason the college of Engineering
now offers both a masters and doctors
degree in Materials Engineering. Even
in the few short years that the program
has been in existence one student is al-
ready well along on his work towards a
doctors degree.
The fourth area in which a material
engineer might work is in the field of
customer contact. He would be primarily
responsible for adapting his company's
product to that of the industrial consumer.
Just what does the future hold for a
materials engineer? Prof. Van Vlack
points out that the outlook is very bright.
At the present time the pay scale is very
similar to that of metallurgical and chemi-
cal engineers. The demand for materials
engineers is definitely going to increase,
according to Prof. Van Vlack, because
"the trend is more and more toward the
study of fundamental characteristics of
materials." With this fact in mind it is
obvious that one of Michigan's newest
and smallest curriculums and its gradu-
ates are going to become more and more
a permanent part of the engineering
scene.

ENGINEERS IN PATENT LAW
Here is an opportunity for the engineer to
combine his technology with his interest in
meeting people.
The author of the "Engineer
in Patent Law" is indeed an au-
thority on the subject. Town-
send F. Beaman, senior partner
in the patent law firm of Bea-
man &amp; Beaman, graduated from
the University of Michigan in
1928 with a degree in Mechani-
cal Engineering. From 1928 to
1931 he was an Examiner in the
United States Patent Office and
in 1931 was admitted to the
practice of law in Michigan.
It is interesting to note that
Mr. Beaman's son and law part-
ner took his engineering at Tri-
State College and then became
an Examiner in the Patent Office.
At a time when a graduate with a
Bachelor of Science among his
degrees is so greatly needed to assist in
keeping up with our neighbors in the
art of destruction, it borders on treason
to ones country to even suggest diverting
an engineer into a constructive channel
of endeavor.
However, engineers have not always
been in such short supply, nor has the
present value of their services always been
appreciated. In 1924, when the writer was
encouraged to attend engineering school
to prepare himself to practice patent law,
most of the freshmen in his class were
there because they had shown some in-
terest and ability in the operation of
Model-T Fords or crystal sets. When
the Engineering Class of 1928 held its
first reunion in Ann Arbor in the early
1930's, only a handful could afford
transportation, and the majority attend-
ing had gone into fields other than
straight engineering.
For the past ten years, it has been my
privilege to lecture once or twice a year
before classes of undergraduates in the
Engineering College at Ann Arbor on the
subject of patent law as a vocation for
engineers. From my own experience in
that field, I felt fully justified in encour-
aging undergraduates to consider enter-
ing the Patent Office as Examiners and
to enroll in one of the evening law
schools in Washington. During this
period I have had some success as a re-
cruiter.
To compete with industry, the Patent
Office, as an employer, is attempting to
attract graduate engineers with starting
salaries from $4,480.00 to $5,335.00
which are increased to $8,215.00 within
2y2 years with present top salaries as
much as $13,760.00 attainable after a
reasonable length of service. No civil
service examination is required of grad-
uates. The Patent Office encourages its
Examiners to attend evening law school
by upgrading the salaries of law school
graduates.
Aside from the fact that the career of
the Patent Office Examiner is one of the
most interesting and useful positions in
governmental service, the whole field of
patent law practice is open to the engi-
neer at any time after his four years in
evening law school. As a patent lawyer,
the engineer will find excellent oppor-
tunity to establish his own private prac-
tice in almost any city of 50,000 or more
population anywhere in the United States.
Also, there is a steady demand for Patent
Office Examiners in the established patent
law firm and in the patent departments of
industrial concerns. Starting salaries of
$10,000.00 to $12,000.00 are being cur-
rently offered by industry with difficulty
being experienced in filling openings.
Although the patent lawyer has been
exposed to the same legal education as
the general lawyer, if he specializes in
patent law he will find that his practice
involves about 95% engineering and 5%
law. As a solicitor of patents for in-
ventors, it will be his function to describe
and claim the invention and to prosecute
the applications for patent protection be-
fore the Patent Office. As a former patent
examiner, the engineer, in the role of
patent lawyer, is fully prepared to skill-
fully represent his first client before the
Patent Office. The law graduate in gen-
eral practice has had no such opporttunity
for experience.
The patent lawyer performs many
functions in engineering: A client brings
to his attention what is thought to be an
improvement upon some existing device.
To determine if it is a patentable
improvement, a novelty investigation
through the files of the search room at
the Patent Office is conducted. If the
client intends to manufacture the inven-

by JAMES STEVENS
Twenty-five years ago an interesting
theory of economics was prevalent,
named Technocracy. This theory was par-
ticularly interesting to the engineer be-
cause it proposed exchanging the gold
standard with an energy standard. Its
principle tenets were: (1) that business
collapse and unemployment are domin-
antly and inevitably caused by techni-
cal changes, (2) that economic control
should revolve about energy and its meas-
urements in energy units, rather than
value and its money units, and (3) that
economic arrangements should be gen-
erally reconstructed along scientific lines
with technical people increasingly influ-
ential. Although Technocracy was short-
lived I thought it might prove of interest
to read an engineer's answer to the
theory's proposed changes at the time the
theory was prevalent. From the Michigan
Technic files comes this article of
twenty-five years ago, "Technocracy."
"To contribute a worthwhile discus-
sion about Technocracy is an exceedingly
difficult task. One more personal opinion
would seem not to be worth much in the
midst of such a flood of opinions as we
have on this subject at present. In the
expression of one's views, any attempt at
interpreting meanings is likely to be mere-
ly a reflection of one's background and
an airing of one's prejudices. With ade-
quate, authentic information about the
theory of Technocracy unavailable, the
best that can be done is to attempt to
evaluate such statements as seem to have
some degree of reliability. Because of a
lack of space it seems wise to refer prin-
cipally to Harper's Magazine for Janu-
ary, 1933, inasmuch as the article it
contains is said to have been prepared
under the supervision of Howard Scott,
Director of the Energy Survey of North
America.
"The comments that have been made
public have ranged from whole-hearted
and complete endorsement of the views
of the Technocrats to a skeptical distrust
of any part of their position, and there
has been a number of attempts to dis-
credit the integrity of Mr. Scott, who is
the leading member of the group. There
is a prevalent feeling that they have a
pessimistic outlook for the future, and
there is almost universal opinion that
they have made a thoroughly clear pre-
sentation of their case. They were ac-
cused of exaggeration, of the presentation
of one-sided facts, of failure to recognize
any reasonableness in any other point of
view, and of extreme vagueness. In view
of the startling nature of their facts and
conclusions, these varied reactions are not
to be wondered at.
"'A crisis in the history of American
civilization is at hand. The nation stands
at the threshold of what is simultaneously
opportunity and disaster. The opportun-
ity is one for social benefit, the disaster
is the failure of the price system; and
neither opportunity nor disaster may be
escaped.' This quotation summarizes the
opinions of the Technocrats. The facts
and analysis presented are in support of
these contentions. Those who can vision
no successful economic organization other
than the 'price system,' forsee only dis-
aster if the predictions of the Techno-
crats are true. Students of radical, social,
and economic works see no disaster in the
failure of the price system, in fact, they
see its fall as a necessity, and they forsee
the realization of their hopes for a more
just distribution of the world's goods
and pleasures. The threat of disaster and
likewise of opportunity is claimed.
Whether the resultant opinion is cheery
or dark depends upon the background of
the individual who views it. It does not
seem that the Technocrats are necessarily
guilty of having presented a pessimistic
outlook.
"If they were absolutely clear and logi-
cal, they would likely receive much criti-
cism because they have made such sweep-
ing statements. 'How clearly can it now
be seen that our bankers are merchants
of debt and economics is the pathology
of debt . . . We need look for no help
from Republicans, Democrats, Socialists.
Fascists, or Communists." In effect, they
say that every one is out of step but them-
selves. How much of the public reaction
is against this attitude, and how much is
justified by a careful review of their most
complete statement? After all, it is con-
ceivable that 120,000,000 Americans
could be wrong in their understanding of
our present situation.
"The Technocrats give figures to show
how much more power is available for
the production of goods than was the case
when man and his beasts of burden were
the principal source. More figures tell
how the harnessing of this power to ma-
chines is reducing the amount of human
labor necessary in production. Still other
figures are given to show what could be
done if the price system did not cause the
withholding from use, income equivalent
to 20,000 dollars a year for everyone,
under a system of production organized
to make use of available technological
knowledge in a coordinated manner, is
startling . They argue that we only need
to recognize that power is the dominant
factor in our American civilization, that
if we measure good in terms of energy
units we will have a precise measure,
which will enable us to eliminate the
confusion caused by the one of our in-
adequate standard, the gold dollar. They
further state that we do this, because our
structure of civilization is growing in
such a way, that if we continue our anti-
quated theories of measurement, it will
fail.
"That energy use is of major import-
ance in the era cannot be denied. Surely
men do less work in producing more
28
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


There is no reason for doubting that
many practices are engaged in which cause
the withholding of improved processes
for the sake of profit. We know that
many things are done against the social
welfare and that business is organized
on a basis which stimulates anti-social
practices. Food is destroyed to keep up
the market value. Advertising is untrue.
In many ways we still grant the right of
an individual to try to profit at the ex-
pense and even the suffering of the group.
The economic moral is the one stated by
David Harum: 'Do unto others as they
would like to do unto you—but be sure
to do it first.' When one realizes the
enormous wastes that occur as a result of
applying individual horsepower psychol-
ogy to a social, electric power world, it
does not take much imagination to guess
that we might all be better off.
"It is unfortunate that there is prob-
ably justice in believing that exaggera-
tions have been made. Common sense
tells us that many of the statements made
are in the direction of being right. It is
difficult to tell how far accusations of un-
reliability are true. Why engineers would
be led to over-state their case, especially
when it would appear to be a strong
one without overstatement, is hard to
understand. Yet many things are said
which common sense again makes it hard
to believe. It would seem wise for us as
engineers to serve judgment until we
are in a position to know the reliability
of information necessary in reaching a
conclusion. It would seem a duty to be
actively and constantly in search of such
information. We must realize that any far-
reaching and fundamental attack upon
the inadequacy of existing institutions
will tend to evoke defense reaction which
are not truthful and wholesome. Because
slighting statements have been made about
them is no reason why Republicans,
Democrats, Socialists, or Communists
should close their minds to a considera-
tion of the general thesis. The Techno-
crats seem not to have been very accurate
nor very clear in coordinating their tech-
nical, economic, and social views. That
however, is no reason for discarding their
points of view which may have worth.
Even though it may not benecessary, as
they (and many others) believe, it cer-
tainly would seem desirable to make hon-
est and serious endeavor to learn how to
improve the world in which we live.
This is their challenge. We must and we
can make great changes, but information
and thinking are necessary.
"While they belittle economics and
say that the development of technology is
responsible for our ills, yet they make an
economic analysis essential like that pro-
pounded as early as 1866, by Karl Marx,
and from that analysis draw the op-
posite conclusion that it is not technology
nor the machine, but the manner in
which these are used, which is respons-
ible for our sorry state of affairs. 'Our
debts have been increasing at a rate faster
than production and both of them faster
than the rate of population. . . . Modern
industry is operated under the price sys-
tem and to be successful it must do one
thing; it must make a profit and pay a
return on the money invested. . . . The
small investing fraction of our population
cannot possibly spend all their interest
and dividends, and the result is that this
return must be reinvested in production.
. . . This means that production must pay
further interest and dividends. ... It
isn't what people produce that proves
their wealth, it is what they consume. . . .
It is plain that we must get for our-
selves a new series of standards if we are
to deal with this highly intricate social
mechanism that technology has built. . . .
It matters not a rap what men think,
wish or desire. . . . We are face to face
with the law of nature. ... A new sys-
tem based upon a recognition and an
understanding of our available energy
must be devised. . . . That is the prob-
lem before the people. It can be done.
Are we going to set about it before it is
too late?' It is hoped that these scattered
quotations give a just and fair summary
of their analysis. It would seem more
realistic to state that technology has
speeded the development of the price
(profit) system to the breaking point.
Many believe that the socialization of
functional processes would have eventu-
ally made this inevitable, without the
technical advances. In fact, technology is
just an advanced stage and a natural result
of the development of the socialization
process.
"To one familiar with the economic lit-
erature of Veblen, Steinmetz, Marx,
Lenin, and Trotzky, there is nothing new
in this economic analysis, except pos-
sibly that it is carelessly done. There is
little question that the position taken has
been inspired by the works of Socialist
writers, and is essentially the one held
by those who like to consider themselves
scientific socialists. The technocrats have
enthusiastically added their interpretation
of technological development in terms
of this older fundamental theory. They
emphasize the importance of measuring
goods in terms of energy units. Their
enthusiasm apparently has caused them to
forget many of the social implications
of the fundamental theory. It has also
caused them to use terminology in a very
confusing manner to be indispensable. (It
is witness to a profound truth that only
a few years ago was guessed at—that
physical wealth is not measured in terms
of labor, goods, or money, but in terms
of energy. . . . Value cannot be measured,
it has no metrical equivalent). If these
are fair quotations it would seem that an
intelligent person would upon reflection,
question them and desire a full ex-
planation of their meaning.
"Their Theory of Energy Determinants
has been referred to but apparently it has
not been publicly stated. As nearly as can
be guessed at it seems to propose that the
right to the use of goods be given by a
per capita allotment of all energy used
in production, expressed in terms of
energy units. The debit side of the indi-
vidual account would be provided for by
causing goods to be measured by the
energy units necessary for their pro-
duction. The allotment not to be transfer-
able and not to be carried over from year
to year, i.e., allotment for use only. It
may be an error to even guess another's
theory in the absence of a definite state-
ment, but it seems necessary to ponder
statements from various sources, and to
make the guess if we are to get any
notion of what they are driving at. It
would seem that some variation of such
a plan might be feasible, or even neces-
sary. Perhaps, even if time should show
the plan of the Technocrats to be ideal,
another plan for measurement of values
might be necessary as an intervening
transitional development. A means of
adopting the plan is not suggested and
this would seem to be due partly to a
neglect of thought on the nature of the
present social structure, and partly be-
cause it is thought that the plan will
have to be evolved.
"We certainly have been given some-
thing to read about, talk about, hear
about, and think about. If we are thought-
ful we will take Technocracy as another
point of view that may aid us in plan-
ning future action. If we are cautious or
charitable, we may admit, that perhaps
those who are expounding, after gather-
ing and correlating a great amount of
data, are 'away ahead of us.' If we are
prejudiced we may point out all the flaws,
that we can find, and cast it aside as
just another wild, Socialistic scheme."

"No one is competent to assert things about abso-
lute space and absolute motion; they are pure
matters of thought that cannot be produced in
experience. All our principles of mechanics, as we
have shown in detail, are experienced knowledge
concerning the relative positions and motions of
bodies. They could not be. and were not, admitted
in the areas in which they are now recognized as
valid, without previous testing. No one is war-
ranted in extending these principles beyond the
boundaries of experience. In fact, such an exten-
sion is meaningless, as no one would possess the
knowledge to make use of it."

Some Social rf&amp;ftecfo o£
Automation,
The winner of the Cooley Essay Contest for
1957, this article is reprinted in the Technic
to bring its ideas on the social aspect of auto-
mation to its readers.
Automation is a word that has grown
up in the last decade. Newspapers
and magazines mention of it daily.
Factory executives greet automation as the
answer to their prayers, while union
leaders speak of automation in fearful
tones. What is automation, and what will
it mean to labor and to society?
What is Automation?
There is no single, clear definition of
automation available. Webster's diction-
ary does not even include it. The word
was coined independently by two differ-
ent men at about the same time: Del S.
Harder, Vice-President in charge of pro-
duction for the Ford Motor Company,
and John Diebold, then at Harvard
Business School. Mr. Harder originally
used the word to describe automatic ma-
terials handling between operations, but
now thinks this is too narrow and quotes
W. E. Brainard for a better definition:
"Automation is more than merely
transferring. Nor is it a push but-
ton factory. It is a philosophy that
may extend back to the design of
the product. It is a new method of
manufacture, not necessarily a new
way of cutting metal, but a way of
controlling the various processes.
Automation is a philosophy of de-
sign, it is a manufacturing method,
and it is control within the ma-
chine." 1
Mr. Diebold said nearly the same thing
when he gave this definition:
"Automation represents a new way
of thinking about the total process of
production: that it denotes both
automatic operation and the process
of making operations automatic,
with a resultant emphasis on self-
regulation of the entire process." 2
Automation, as seen in the light of
these definitions, is not something new;
it is, rather, the logical next step after
mechanization of manufacturing proc-
esses. Over a number of years mechaniza-
tion has been replacing human control of
production with automatic control. Auto-
matic control supposedly had its begin-
nings way back in 1680 when Dennis
Papin put a brick on the lid of a boil-
ing pot to maintain its pressure. Other
historical developments were recorded in
1760 when an inventor in Danzig built
a loom that could weave six webs at
once, and in 1788 when James Watt in-
vented the revolving ball governor to
maintain constant speed on steam en-
gines.3
Today three types of automation are
recognized. The first is called integration
or transfer automation. The second is
called feedback control. The third is com-
puter technology. A clearer understand-
ing may be gained by examining each in
more detail.
Integration
Del Harder was thinking of integra-
tion when he first coined the word auto-
mation. Automatic materials handling is
the base of integration. Thus, it is also
called transfer automation. The product
to be processed is moved from machine
to machine in a continuous flow, with
moving, positioning, holding, machining,
and inspecting all done automatically.
The automobile manufacturers present
examples of this type. Automobile engine
blocks have over 100 operations per-
formed on them without human handling.
Feedback Control
Feedback control compares actual per-
formance with expected performance.

regulate itself and to adjust its per-
formance to predetermined quality stand-
ards. Feedback thinking is mostly elec-
trical, rather than mechanical, as in the
case of integration. Servomechanisms
actuate the mechanical controls that ad-
just the performance. The home thermo-
stat illustrates how a predetermined tem-
perature is selected and maintained
through a feedback from the room to
the furnace.
The leading industrial example is
found in petroleum refining. There a
crew of eight men supervise a refinery
covering many acres without ever seeing
the oil that is being processed.4
Computer Technology
Computer technology is the application
of electronics to mathematics. Mathemati-
cal formulaton is necessary before the
machine can operate, but once the form-
ulae are programmed, the computer can
apply it to pertinent data to relieve rou-
tine figuring.
Computer technology is characterized
as office automation. Computers have been
used to figure payrolls, inventories, divi-
dends and interest payments, tax deduc-
tions, and to prepare customer bills.
Consolidated Edison Company of New
York, Inc., eliminated coins in pay en-
velopes with the aid of electronic com-
puting machines. Pay is rounded off to
the next highest dollar. The next week
the excess from the previous week is sub-
tracted from the employee's pay and is
again rounded off. Under the new sys-
tem, savings in sorting, counting, filling,
and distributing the pay envelopes have
been large while service to the employees
has not diminished.5
Why Automation?
Now that we have in mind what auto-
mation is, let's turn to the economic
reasons for automating. Summed up,
Automation is a further "trend in the
continuing search for greatest results
with the least expenditure of human and
material resources." 6
Reduction of Production Costs
"There is a tendency to look upon
automation as a possible means of
reducing labor costs, exclusively.
Automation may indeed reduce costs,
but not so much by reducing labor
costs as by making possible a higher
output per unit investment through
more accurate, faster production,
with reduced spoilage, fuller utili-
zation of machine capacity, greater
economy in floor space, and reduced
accident hazards—all of which are
important in the final cost of the
product." 7
Improvements in Methods and
Operations
Automation will require "general ac-
ceptance by industry of a fundamental re-
thinking of the entire production process,
including the redesign of the product it-
self in order to adapt it to automatic pro-
duction methods rather than the search
for automatic production methods adapted
to existing designs." 8
Production operations will be elimin-
ated, simplified, or combined to reduce
machines needed and to shorten machin-
ing time.
Production of New Products
Fissionable materials rely on automa-
tion for their production. In this case,
there is no alternative because human
handling is not possible. Mechanical
handling devices with feedback controls
and television eyes will be the only means
for working with some atomic materials.
It is also expected that many heretofore
unexplored fields will be opened up by
the use of mechanical feedbacks to obtain
data for human interpretation. For ex-
ample, weather balloons now report posi-
tion, temperature, humidity, and other
data automatically by radio.
Who Will Automation Affect?
Automation will affect fewer lines of
business than is often presumed. Clear-
ly, only certain kinds of companies will
have the right products, sufficient sales
volume, adequate finances, or type of
organization to support automation. Even
among those companies which are logi-
cal candidates for automation, long run
strategy may indicate for many that flexi-
bility of operations is more important
than low cost production. Individual
managements need to grasp fully the po-
tentialities and limitations of automation
in respect to their particular needs. They
must weigh ascertainable advantages
against the costs of installing the new
process. These costs would include not
only the direct cost of equipment but also
the cost and uncertainties involved in
redesigning the production process or
product itself, retraining and reorganizing
the work force, as well as allowing for
the uncertainties of the market in a
dynamic economy.
Automation will invade the American
business scene gradually, affecting, first,
one industrial sector and, then, another.
The speed of change is limited by the
large amount of capital that must be
raised, the lack of automation specialists
available to plan the changeover, and the
time needed to train a workforce to main-
tain the automated equipment.
What Problems Will
Management Face?
There are three basic problems with
which management will be faced. We will
treat these problems separately even
though they are so closely inter-related
that separation is only theoretical. The
root of these problems is increased spec-
ialization—somewhat of a paradox be-
cause specialization also provides many of
automation's advantages.
Increased Technological Complexity
Transfer automation will require more
intensive thought all through the produc-
tion process to be successful. The product,
itself, may have to be simplified or re-
designed to fit known methods. The
sequence of operations to be performed
may have to be altered. Layout of the pro-
duction area is important for materials
handling. Choice of machines and bal-
ancing of the machines in the line is
necessary. The machines will need effec-
tive preventive maintenance. Overall co-
ordination is necessary to keep every-

skilled workmen. Engineers, technically
trained set-up men, and maintenance
workers will be needed in larger numbers
than ever before. Management will have
to take the initiative to train these men
if they are to be obtained in sufficient
numbers.
Higher Capitalization
Increased technological complexity also
means higher machine costs. The huge
transfer machines and electronic compu-
ters stagger the imagination with their ac-
companying costs. International Business
Machine Company rents their largest com-
puter to General Motors Corporation for
$40,000 per month. It comes complete
with eight engineer-specialists to keep it
running. GM keeps 30 engineers busy
formulating programs for the computer
to solve.
Replacement of direct labor is only ac-
complished by increasing capital expen-
ditures. This means a machine must be
built that will perform the displaced
worker's tasks. Again the figures are large.
It is estimated that $5000 is needed to
replace a man with IBM billing. Fairlcss
Steel Works estimated the replacement
cost of one man at $75,000. Industries
and jobs vary, of course, in capital neces-
sary for replacement but $20,000 might
be a rough average figure."
With the burden of these costs, some
companies will be limited in their ability
to automate. Other companies will not
have large enough volume to justify
automation when the capital costs are
distributed. Economical lot sizes may be
obtained at the sacrifice of flexibility.
As for smaller businesses, the more
the big companies automate and bind
themselves to a rigid framework of
operations, the more opportunities there
are for the enterprising small-scale man-
agement to tap regional demands, to
meet minor variations in customer wants,
to serve specialized needs, and, in general,
to move quickly as circumstances de-
mand.1"
Better Coordination of Production Flow
Recognition of the coordination needed
between producing and selling consumer
appliances has led the General Electric-
Company to adopt a marketing-manager
34
plan of control. The marketing-manager,
often called a vice-president in charge of
sales or distribution in other concerns,
is expected to place emphasis on sales
planning and marketing research, as well
as upon selling and field sales organiza-
tion. The responsibilities of the market-
ing-manager also include control over
pricing, and over product planning, pro-
duction scheduling, and finished goods
inventories—responsibilities often placed
in production departments. Engineering
services, such as those comprehended in
survey work, and other types of service
are also under the marketing-manager. He
reports directly to the president."
The marketing-manager plan recog-
nizes that the premium will be on more
effective selling. If the plant is set up
to turn out a stream of products, the sales
department must be able to move it
smoothly and regularly. The Marketers
will have to supply the flexibility for
shortrun ups and downs in demand
without incurring exorbitant inventory
costs or an abysmally low rate of return
on a high investment in equipment which
is not running at capacity. More efficient
selling may take the form of the super-
market approach, where scrambling of
merchandise aims to regroup products
for the convenience of the consumer.
However, this demands a pre-sold mar-
ket which puts the burden of selling on
the manufacturer.12
What Are the Social Effects?
One consequence of automation would
be to offer workers a choice between
greater leisure and added products and
comforts. Aute L. Carr, writing in the
Christian Century, said:
"Leisure makes the human really hu-
man. As long as all his energies go
into survival he is still a beast. . . .
The Greek work for leisure is
'schole,' from which the English
'school' is derived. For the ancient
Greeks, leisure and learning were in-
timately related. They looked at
leisure in a positive way, in con-
trast to our negative ideas of it as
merely not-work." 13
More leisure opens the question of
what to do with it. Will the "devil find
work for idle hands?" Or will leisure
time be for the good of the whole com-
munity? If we are to think positively, we
must see leisure as a chance to develop
philosophy and the arts, continue educa-
tion, pursue hobbies, or further family
companionship.
The alternative to more leisure is a
higher standard of living. We might find
ourselves enslaved to the machines, on a
treadmill selling, distributing, and con-
suming their products in order that the
whole mechanical process may not stop.
The choice may be made at the indi-
vidual level in the form of the job the
worker takes or at the national level in
the form of work laws. The solution un-
doubtedly will be a balancing off of one
against the other because neither extreme
is healthy.
Dissatisfaction with work is cited as
another effect of automation. Harold Rut-
tenberg has said that automation makes
the daily work of millions of people a
bore, forcing them either into stultifi-
cation or into finding creative outlets
away from their jobs.'4 H. deBivort has
this to say in answer.
"So far as satisfaction from work is
concerned the report suggests that
partial automation is likely to in-
crease dissatisfactions due to ma-
chine-pacing, but that this trend will
be reversed when processes become
fully automatic, since the worker is
no longer involved in the chain of
operations of the product. Safety and
working conditions can be improved
through automation. The operator
may also find new satisfactions from
having a wider understanding of the
relationship of his job to the whole
production process and from helping
to control an imposing array of
machinery. On the other hand there
is the loss of satisfaction from physi-

Truly aviation is still in the pioneering stage, and
one of the leaders is Northrop Aircraft, which has
been making successful contributions to our

U-M
INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
DEPARTMENT
The evolution of the Industrial
Engineering Department typi-
fies the stages that any new
curriculum goes through in its
development.
The Industrial Engineering Depart-
ment is the newest of all depart-
ments in the Engineering College. The
beginning started with Professor Joseph
Bursley of the Mechanical Engineering
Department when he made the acquain-
tance of the Gilbreths and other leaders
in the field of scientific management dur-
ing a visit of the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers to Germany in
1910.
After this initial exposure to scientific
management, Professor Bursley between
the years 1913 and 1915 made a study of
applications in scientific management to
various manufacturing plants. He felt
that a study of this type would provide
a foundation for instruction in the scien-
tific management field in the College of
Engineering. The outcome of this study
by Professor Bursley resulted in the estab-
lishment, in 1915, of a course in scientific
shop management and it was officially
introduced to the curriculum at that time
as Mechanical Engineering 35, which was
the first instruction in this field to be
offered by any American College or Uni-
versity. In 1917, during World War I,
the demand for this type of instruction in-
creased through Army requests for offi-
cer training in the Ordnance Department.
After this, M.E. 35—Scientific Shop Man-
agement was used as a basis for establish-
ing similar instruction in other institu-
tions.
When Professor Bursley became Dean
of Students in 1921, he suggested that
Charles B. Gordy be brought to tfc
University of Michigan to carry on the
instruction in scientific shop management.
When Professor Gordy arrived from
Pennsylvania, he was given the title oi
Assistant Professor in Mechanical Engi-
neering.
Professor Gordy was instrumental in
getting Dean Mortimer E. Cooley of the
College of Engineering interested in Engi-
neering Administration Instruction, and
asked that a committee be appointed to
study this particular field of education.
This committee reported favorably, and 3
sequence of elective courses was sug-
gested to be offered in the field of En-
gineering Administration. These elective
courses were to be given so that no inter-
ference would result in the fundamental
engineering subjects.
Apparently some more thought was
given to this field of instruction and per-
haps some objections were discussed In
any event, Dean Cooley appointed J
second committee, consisting of Profes-
sors Bursley, Gordy, and Airy to initiate
a study in work then known as Produc-

vania, received his B.S.M.E. from the U. of M. in 1937. From
that time until his appointment to the staff in September of 1949,
Prof. Steffy worked for Surface Combustion Corp. in Toledo,
U. S. Steel in Pittsburgh, and Thompson Products in Cleveland.
In between times, he has done private consulting work and in
1956, his industrial engineering handbook was published.
tion or Industrial Engineering. Professor
Airey, at the time this committee was
formed in 1921, was superintendent of
shops in the University. In 1924, he re-
signed and went to work with the King-
Seeley Corporation in Ann Arbor, for
which company he served, later in his
career, as President and Chairman of the
Board.
The committee recommended to Dean
Cooley that a separate department be es-
tablished and that it be known as the
Department of Industrial Engineering.
This committee also recommended that
the curriculum consist basically of five
courses in Industrial Engineering and 18
hours of elective courses.
Nothing was done about the recom-
mendations of the two Cooley committees
until three years later in 1924. At this
time Professor E. E. Day of the Economics
Department showed some interest in com-
bining studies in economics with studies
in engineering to prepare students in the
field of production. Chairman Henry C.
Anderson of the department of Mechani-
cal Engineering was contacted by Pro-
fessor Day. As a result of this meeting,
another committee consisting of Profes-
sors Degeman and Gordy to study sug-
gestions made by Professor Day along
with the reports of the two Cooley Com-
mittees. The outcome of these discus-
sions resulted in a recommendation to
establish a 5-year course in Mechanical
and Industrial Engineering consisting of
173 credit hours of work. This recom-
mendation was adopted by the Engineer-
ing College in May, 1924.
Eight years later, in 1932, the 5-
year program in Mechanical and Indus-
trial Engineering had graduated only 14
students. Since other degree programs re-
quired only 4-years of course study, the
5-year program became extremely un-
popular and was doomed to failure.
Therefore, a new degree was proposed
to the Board of Regents in 1934 so that
a degree in Mechanical Engineering
would be awarded at the end of the
fourth year and then upon completion of
a year in graduate school a Master's de-
gree in Industrial Engineering would be
granted. This change resulted in more
students taking this course which, at the
end of 5-years of study, led to a master's
degree in Industrial Engineering.
There were a few minor changes in
the curriculum after 1934, but no im-
portant changes occurred in Industrial
Engineering until 1946 when the degree
designation was changed to Bachelor of
Science in Engineering (Industrial-Me-
chanical). Thus, in 1946, the word "In-
dustrial" was added for the first time to
the degree award at the end of 4 years
of work.
Professor Gordy, in 1950, was instru-
mental in getting a representative from
the Engineering Concil for Professional
Development to come to the University to
evaluate the curriculum in Industrial Engi-
neering. The representative from the
ECPD made some suggestions in certain
areas of the Industrial Engineering cur-
riculum, and at the end of approximately
a year these changes were incorporated,
and the Industrial Engineering curriculum
became one accredited by the ECPD.
These changes resulted in some reduction
in the requirements for graduation in the
accounting field and some additions in the
Industrial Engineering field in the areas
of Engineering Economy, Wage Incen-
tives and job Evaluation, Production Con-
trol, and Plant Layout. With these addi-
tional courses and with the accredition of
the ECPD, the Board of Regents in 1951
approved a program leading to the Bache-
lor of Science degree in Industrial Engi-
neering.
As a result of the growing recognition
in the field of Industrial Engineering,
the department of Mechanical Engineer-
ing was changed to the Department of
Mechanical and Industrial Engineering in
JANUARY, 1958

there were 4 teachers in the Mechanical
and Industrial Engineering Department
who were primarily associated with In-
dustrial Engineering courses. These teach-
ers were Professor Gordy, Associate Pro-
fessor Vines, Assistant Professor Steffy,
and Instructor Page. About this time the
titles of these teachers were changed to
Professors and Instructors in Industrial
Engineering rather than Professors and
Instructors in Mechanical and Industrial
Engineering. Thus Professor Gordy be-
came the first full professor of Industrial
Engineering at the University.
The program in Industrial Engineering
in 1952 consisted of two options, "A and
B." "Option A" could be defined as the
field of planning, job specifications, job
evaluation, time study, motion study, rate
of existing in the plant in the industry
using the most efficient methods in which
labor strives to give the utmost instead
of taking action to limit production.
Also, that high wage rates can be paid
when production per worker justifies
them.
"Option B" was intended to meet the
need of those students whose interest lies
in the field of manufacturing operations
and methods. It includes the study of
such processes as casting, forging, roll-
ing, die casting, stamping, molding, ma-
chining, and the related functions of
production planning, factory layout, proc-
essing, jig fixture and tool design, esti-
mating for production, and inspection.
Fabrication of material into finished parts
was stressed in this option.
In the fall of 1955 Wyeth Allen came

setting, incentive payment, plant layout,
materials handling, production control,
quality control, inventory control, em-
ployee rating, order procedures, packing
and shipping, materials, salvage and waste
reduction, and maintenance control. In
explaining these functions of Industrial
Engineering, Professor Gordy emphasized,
on numerous occasions, that the real in-
dustrial engineer is an enthusiast about
the need for producing industry's goods
and services at the lowest possible cost.
He further subscribed to the philosophy
that high wage rates had the best chance
to the University as Professor of In-
dustrial Engineeding and Chairman of
the Department of Mechanical and In-
dustrial Engineering. For several years
prior to coming to the University he had
been the President of a large manufac-
turing company and before that was for
many years the head of his own consult-
ing management engineering firm.
At the end of the spring semester in
1956 the Department of Production Engi-
neering was absorbed into the Mechanical
Engineering Department, and "Option A"
and "B" of Industrial Engineering dis-
appeared. At this time there wis
set up an independent Department of
Industrial Engineering with its own bud-
get and Professor Allen as Chairman (he
has also remained as Chairman of the
Mechanical Engineering Department).
The summer of 1956 produced many
changes. Early in the year the University
of Michigan and Waseda University in
Tokyo had signed an agreement spon-
sored by the International Cooperation
Administration of the United States Gov-
ernment, whereby there would be an ex-
change of professors, and Michigan would
help Waseda set up an institute for Re-
search and Productivity. Professor Gordy
and Assistant Professor Page, with their
families, left for Japan in September on
a two year assignment. Their teaching
duties were taken over by three new-
men, Associate Professor James A. Gage.
Assistant Professor Richard Berkeley, and
Instructor Richard Wilson.
In the fall of 1956 a number of
changes were made in the Industrial Engi-
neering curricula; some Mechanical
Engineering subjects were dropped and
some of the newer Industrial Engineering
subjects such as "Operations Research''
and "Data Processing" were added.
A very successful Operations Research
Seminar for industrial executives was con-
ducted in Detroit during the next year,
and the extension course work of the
department was considerably expanded.
Several members of the Engineering Re-
search Institute were used on a part time
basis to handle this additional work.
During the past year there has been J
continuous review and revision of all
courses and the addition of some more
new ones such as "Human Engineering-
New textbooks have been adopted for
many courses, and the whole program has
been considerably strengthened.
Whereas most of the above applies to
the undergraduate courses the graduate
program has also expanded. In addition to
the normal number of graduates on cam-
pus this year the department has started
in connection with the Extension Divi-
sion a series of courses leading to a
Master's Degree in Industrial Engineer-
ing. There are eighteen men in a class at
Flint. As a matter of historical interest.
the first Ph.D. Degree in Industrial Engi-
neering was received by Mr. Robert C
Carson, Jr., in 1953. Dr. Carson is no»
Associate Dean of the Engineering School
at the University of North Carolina. The
Industrial Engineering student population
has increased from 98 in 1952 to 260 in
1957, and it would seem that this steady
growth will continue.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNtC


Among the many engineering problems relative to
designing and developing today's tremendously
powerful aircraft engines is the matter of accumu-
lating data — much of it obtained from within the
engines themselves — and recording it precisely.
Such is the continuing assignment of those at Pratt
&amp; Whitney Aircraft who are working in the highly
complex field of instrumentation.
Pressure, temperature, air and fuel flow, vibra-
tion — these factors must be accurately measured
at many significant points. In some cases, the meas-
uring device employed must be associated with
special data-recording equipment capable of con-
verting readings to digital values which can, in turn,
be stored on punch cards or magnetic tape for data
processing.
Responsible for assembling this wealth of infor-
mation so vital to the entire engineering team at
Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft is a special group of elec-
tronic, mechanical and aeronautical engineers and
physicists. Projects embrace the entire field of
instrumentation. Often involved is the need for
providing unique measuring devices, transducers,
recorders or data-handling equipment. Hot-wire
anemometry plays an important role in the drama
of instrumentation, as do various types of sonic
orifice probes, high temperature strain gages, tran-
sistor amplifiers, and miniaturized tape recording
equipment.
Instrumentation, of course, is only one part of a
broadly diversified engineering program at Pratt &amp;
Whitney Aircraft. That program — with other
far-reaching activities in the fields of combustion,
materials problems, mechanical design and aero-
dynamics — spells out a gratifying future for many
of today's engineering students.
The "Plottomat", designed by P &amp; W A
instrumentation engineers, records pres-
sure, temperature and air flow direction.
It is typical of an expanding program in
automatic data recording and handling.

U-M
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
DEPARTMENT
This is the story of an old de-
partment as told by a faculty
member who knows most about
it.
rIt is proper to note at the beginning that
much material has come from an article en-
titled "The Department of Mechanical and
Industrial Engineering," from "The Univer-
sity of Michigan; a Century of Engineering
Education"; Ann Arbor, University of Michi-
gan Press. 1954.]
The Mechanical Engineering Depart-
ment has a long list of very dis-
tinguished and outstanding educators in
the past and present and biographies of
all of them would be interesting and ap-
propriate if space permitted. Since it
would be unjust to include some without
including others, brief references will be
made to those individuals who are asso-
ciated with major changes and develop-
ments in the Department.
In 1868, Professors De Volson Wood
and Stillman W. Robinson made a re-
quest to the Regents for the establish-
ment of a course in mechanical engineer-
ing and this request was granted. This
was the first recognition of mechanical
engineering at the University of Michi-
gan.
Reference to the Regents Proceedings
of June, 1870, indicate that the venture
was not altogether satisfactory for it was
resolved "That the degree of Mechanical
Engineer ... be and the same is here-
by abolished, and the course of Civil
Engineering be so extended as to in-
clude the main part of the course of
Mechanical Engineering as heretofore
prescribed." This arrangement existed
for eleven years with Professor De Vol-
son Wood teaching the courses in me-
chanical engineering until his resignation
in 1872.
An event of great importance in the
development of mechanical engineering
at the University of Michigan occurred
in August, 1881, when Mortimer Elwyn
Cooley (U. S. Naval Academy "78e,
M.E. hon. Michigan, '83, LLD. Michigan
Agricultural College '07, Eng. D. Ne-
braska '11, Sc.D. Armour Institute of
Technology '23), assistant engineer of
the United States Navy, at the request of
the Regents was detailed to the Univer-
sity of Michigan as Professor of Steam
Engineering and Iron Shipbuilding to es-
tablish courses in mechanical engineering
in the Department of Civil Engineering.
In September, 1881, his title was changed
to that of Professor of Mechanical Engi-
neering. The establishment of this title in
reality represents the creation of the De-
partment of Mechanical Engineering. The
first report made by Cooley as Professor
of Mechanical Engineering to the Board
of Regents shows that a total of eleven
courses were given and that the total
number of students was 35. It is also in-
teresting to note courses 5 and 6 in
Mechanical Engineering were identical
with courses 5 and 6 in Civil Engineer-
ing and that most of the students taking
them were civil engineering students.
During the latter part of October,
1881, the need for a mechanical engi-

John A. Reiter, Jr., B.S. In Electronics, Arizona State College, '54,
discusses the biggest project so far in his Bell System career
"One of the reasons I joined a Bell Telephone
Company," John says, "was because the engineer-
ing would be more interesting and challenging. I
knew I'd chosen well when I was assigned to assist
in planning a microwave radio relay system between
Phoenix and Flagstaff, Arizona. This was the kind
of challenge I was looking for.
"It was to be a system requiring five intermedi-
ate relay stations, and I began by planning the
tower locations on 'line of sight' paths after a study
of topographical maps. Then I made field studies
using altimeter measurements and conducted path-
loss tests to determine how high each tower should
be. This was the trickiest part of the job, because
it called for detecting the presence of reflecting sur-
faces along the transmission route, and determining
the measures necessary to avoid their effects.
"Not the least part of the job was estimating
the cost of each of the five relay stations, taking into
consideration tower height, access roads, and the
need for special equipment such as de-icing heaters.
All told, the system will cost more than $500,000.
When construction is finished in December of this
year, I'll be responsible for the technical consider-
ations involved in connecting radio relay and tele-
phone carrier equipment. Initially this system will
handle 48 voice channels, but can be expanded to
540. In addition to long distance telephone service,
it will also provide data transmission circuits.
"This assignment is an example of the challenges
a technical man can find in the telephone company.
You take the job from start to finish —from basic
field studies to the final adjustments —with full re-
sponsibility. To technical men who want to get ahead,
that's the ultimate in opportunity."

Washing Machine for
"Hot" Laundry
Something new in washing machines—
one that solves tough wash day problems
without water for cleansing—-is in serv-
ice at the huge Hanford atomic plant,
operated by the General Electric Com-
pany for the Atomic Energy Commission.
The Hanford machine, however, does
not wash clothes. It cleans uranium fuel
slugs after they have been irradiated in-
side nuclear reactors.
Bolted to the floor under 11 feet of
water, the washer bathes fuel elements in
acid to remove the oxides and film formed
under nuclear pile irradiation.
This unique washing machine is oper-
ated under water to protect operators from
radiation emitting from the fuel slugs.
Members of the General Electric irradia-
tion processing department safely conduct
their work from platforms overlooking
the water-filled basin.
The washer, slightly smaller than con-
ventional top-loading home machines, is
constructed to withstand the corrosive
effects of both water and acid. When
filled, the washer holds 16 uranium fuel
elements. It is loaded and unloaded by
instruments controlled from above.
Once the uranium fuel elements have
been cleaned in the acid bath, they are
removed and examined with the aid of
other underwater tools to determine what
changes are wrought by nuclear bombard-
ment. When free of film and oxide col-
lections, they can be accurately weighed
to find out if they lose or gain weight
from reactor exposure.
Other water-filled basins in this special-
ly designed and equipped laboratory con-
tain equipment for photographing the
irradiated slugs, apparatus for measuring
their gamma ray intensity, as well as a
special device for determining the core
grain size of the uranium. All of these
tests are conducted without ever bringing
the "hot" specimens to the surface of the
pools.

Traveling eight times as fast as the
most violent hurricane ever recorded by
man, the tiny air blasts serve as "bound-
ary layer control" on the U. S. Air
Force F-104 for slower landing speeds
and increased control.
First production fighter to incorporate
the new safety feature, the Starfighter
with BLC can land in less distance than
any present-day jet fighter, at touch-
down speeds only moderately higher than
trainer rates.
Boundary layer control is a method of
piping high-velocity compressed air from
the engine into the wing, where it is
squirted from a slotted tube out over the
upper surface of the trailing edge wing
flap. Acting like a vane of air, these
streams smooth out the air flow over the
wing and hold it to the wing surface. The
result is greater wing lift.
J. B. Wassail, director of engineering
at Lockheed California Division, declared
that BLC application to the F-104 marks
the beginning of a new phase in high-
speed flight.
"Use of this technique on all future jet
aircraft seems a certainty," Wassail said.
Extreme thinness of the F-104 A wings,
which have edges sharp enough to cut
a steak, gave engineers a major problem
in fitting BLC mechanisms and other con-
trol devices into the small space available.
Each wing measures only 7 ]/&gt; feet from
fuselage to wingtip. Maximum thickness
is less than Ay2 inches.
Wassail classified boundary layer con-
trol on the F-104A as a jet-age step be-
yond the Fowler flap of increasing wing
lift, which Lockheed pioneered in 1937
on the 244-m.p.h. Model 14 transport.
The Fowler system allowed the under
portion of the wing trailing edge to slide
back on rollers and rotate downward.
This gave more chord (width) and more
camber (curvature) to the wing (thereby
increasing its lift.
"Lack of a dependable high-volume air
source kept boundary layer control on the
drawing boards for a long time," Wasall
recalled. "Now jet engines provide al-
most an infinite air supply."
The Starfighter's General Electric J-79
jet is the most powerful engine of its
type, thrust per pound, yet developed.
Flying faster and higher than any
combat plane, the needle-nosed F-104A
can take off and zoom out of sight in the
stratosphere in about two minutes. It can
pass the speed of sound in a climb and
keep on accelerating.

of the many easy-to-fly features built into
the F-104A," Wassail said. "Top con-
sideration was given to the fact that the
pilot is a part of the weapon system—and
must be given a flying machine commen-
surate with his abilities.
"Kept light in weight and uncluttered
in design, it is as simple and clean as an
air shape can be."
Details on B L C System
Highly compressed air from the engine
is ducted into the tube and out the
slots. A valve, controlling the flow of
air, opens automatically as the flap de-
scends. When the flap angle passes the
15-degree mark the valve begins to open.
A full-open position is reached when the
flap is completely extended at a 4 5-de-
gree angle.
Running the entire 47-inch length of
the flap, the tube has 55 slots. Slots are
placed 0.5 inches apart, center to center.
Each slot is 0.09 inches deep and 0.55
inches wide.
Coming directly from the engine, the
air is hot and fast-moving. It flows
through the slots and over the flap at a
velocity of 2300 feet per second, equal
to the speed of a high-powered rifle bul-
let.
Use of boundary layer control reduces
the F-104A's landing (or stall) speed by
about 20 m.p.h. and cuts down on re-
quired landing distance by almost one-
quarter, engineers disclosed. Exact speed
and distance figures are classified.
Scientists Float Molten Metals
Freely in Space
Man's newest "wonder" metals are now
being investigated by heating them thous-
ands of degrees above white heat, while
they float, freely suspended in space.
Called levitation melting, this unique and
versatile technique was invented by West-
inghouse research scientists and brought
to its present state of development by
the combined efforts of scientists at the
Westinghouse Research Laboratories and
the University of Columbia.
Levitation melting was given its first
major public demonstration at the Inter-
national Amphitheater during the Na-
tional Metals Exposition and Second
World Metallurgical Congress, sponsored
by the American Society for Metals.
At the Westinghouse Research Labora-
tories, Pittsburgh, Pa., levitation melting
is used to prepare highly purified labora-
tory-scale ingots of niobium, zirconium
titanium, molybdenum and dozens of al-
High Frequency alternating current flowing through the coil causes
"wonder" metal to melt while floating freely in space.
loys. Because they melt at very high tem-
peratures, and are extremely active chemi-
cally at such temperatore, these metals
and alloys are difficult to prepare with
equal purity by any conventional method.
In levitation melting, compressed metal
powder is placed inside a copper coil
which carries a high-frequency current of
electricity. Reversing its direction nearly
a million times a second, the electric cur-
rent generates a field of force which floats
the metal charge inside the coil. At the
same time, it converts the metal into a
white-hot molten mass in a matter of
seconds. Temperatures of 4500 to 5000
degrees Fahrenheit are achieved in half
a minute or less, melting all but the most
stubborn of metals.
At white heat, metals such as niobium
and titanium are among the most active
chemicals known. They react chemically
with any known vessel in which they are
melted. The traces of impurities they pick
up cannot be tolerated in research on the
pure metal.
Levitation melting eliminates this prob-
lem entirely, the Westinghouse scientists
point out. No containing vessel is re-
quired, since the molten metal floats freely
in space, confined only within itself. The
whole process is carried out inside a seal-
ed vessel containing an inert gas such as
helium or argon, thereby protecting the
pure metal from contamination by the air.
Simplicity of apparatus, speed of melt-
ing and ease of handling a wide assort-
ment of metals and alloys are other ad-
vantages of levitation melting. The West-
inghouse scientists report that the molten
metal even stirs itself, yielding unusually
uniform alloys from mixtures of dif-
ferent metals.

tories, scientists are using levitation melt-
ing to prepare a wide variety of the
newest metals and alloys for metallurgical
research. Such research with ultrapure
metals seeks the fundamental knowledge
which lies behind their full-scale use as
metals of the future. Thus, in the past
few years, titanium has emerged from the
laboratory as an important building ma-
terial in supersonic aircraft and missiles,
and zirconium has developed into a vital
structural metal in nuclear reactors.
Although not yet "graduated" from
the laboratory, the Westinghouse scient-
ists suggest that niobium—the latest
"wonder" metal—may soon become an
outstanding high-temperature, high-
strength structural metal. Levitation
melting is one of the few methods
known for the preparation of niobium
and niobium-base alloys in the purity re-
quired for fundamental research on the
metal.
Cooling Electronic Equipment
An improved method for cooling elec-
tronic equipment on board ship has been
under study at the National Bureau of
Standards. The method is based on trans-
ferring heat from the equipment cabinet
through an intermediate coolant to sea
water as the ultimate heat sink. Although
undertaken for the Navy Bureau of Ships
by P. Meissner of the Bureau staff to solve
a special design problem in heat transfer,
this technique could be applied to other
than shipboard equipment, and tap water
could be used instead of seawater.
The rapidly increasing use of elec-
tronics aboard modern naval vessels has
placed increased demands on shipboard
cooling equipment. Present-day equip-
ment relies for cooling primarily upon
compartment air provided by the vessel's
ventilating and air conditioning system.
The heat generated by these electronic de-
vices imposes a burden on the ship's fa-
cilities and could subject the equipment
to dangerous overheating in the event that
the cooling system should be shut down
in an emergency. In addition, the ex-
hausting of heated air into the equipment
compartment constitutes a hazard to op-
erating personnel. A solution to these
problems can be achieved by transferring
heat from the equipment to sea water
through an independent cooling system,
rather than relying upon compartment air.
The NBS study was concerned with a
system that would be readily applicable
to existing equipment of conventional
construction. Present equipment is cool-
ed primarily by air convection. If the
equipment cabinets were enclosed and
the air within the cabinet recirculated, a
closed forced-convection system could be
obtained. An air-to-liquid heat exchanger
located within the cabinet could transfer
heat from the air to an intermediate cool-
ant, which, in turn, would give up its
heat to sea water. By using an interme-
diate coolant, such as fresh water, the
practice of piping sea water about the
vessel could be avoided. The feasibility of
this method depends largely on whether
the equipment can be maintained at safe
operating temperatures in locations where
sea water is at its warmest.
The temperature of sea water ranges
from — 2° to +30 C. The intermediate
coolant is therefore available at an upper
limit of about 35°C, while cooling air
can be supplied to the equipment at about
43°C The temperature differentials arc-
necessary for the efficient operation of the
heat exchangers. Since there are many
military-approved components suitable for
operation at 43°C, this temperature would
seem to be a safe upper limit. However,
the temperatures of components inside
large, dense equipment may be much
higher than for components operated
singly out in the open. Since natural con-
vection cannot be relied upon, the appli-
cation of forced convection was in-
vestigated.
Examining the thermal characteristics
of electronic components reveals that they
can be grouped roughly into two broad
categories. Such components as capacitors,
transistors, and semi-conductor diodes
are restricted to the lower operating tem-
peratures, but generally produce little or
no heat. The major heat-dissipating com-
ponents, such as tubes, transformers,
power resistors, and dynamotors, are
usually less sensitive to high temperatures.
To minimize heating of the more sensi-
tive components by the major heat
sources, the two classes of components
are arranged on opposite sides of a metal
sheet. The cooling air is forced to flow
through perforations in the sheet around
the base of each heat-producing compon-
ent. Thus, the cool incoming air below
maintains the sensitive components at the
lowest possible temperature, and is still
available at nearly the inlet temperature
to cool the heat-producing components
above. The heated air is then drawn
through the air-to-liquid heat-exchanger,
cooled, and recirculated within the cabi-
net.
It is not difficult to achieve the desired
sequential air-flow pattern, since much
existing equipment already incorporates
the necessary component part groupin;
to a considerable degree. In the case of
standard chassis construction, it is cus-
tomary to mount vacuum tubes and trans-
formers on the upper side of the chassis,
while such smaller components as capaci-
tors, diodes, and low-wattage resistors
are mounted underneath. The required
air-flow pattern is easily obtained by drill-
ing holes through the chassis around the
base of each heat-producing component,
enclosing the bottom of the chassis, and
supplying air under slight pressure to the
space within the chassis, One component
which does not generally fall into the
desired grouping is the electrolytic capaci-
tor. Because of its large size, this com-
ponent is frequently mounted on top of
the chassis, and is thereby subjected to
high temperatures resulting from its prox-
imity to vacuum tubes and other sources
of heat. Where it is necessary to mount
this component above the chassis, it can
be kept cool by surrounding it with a re-
flective metal baffle and placing a few per-
forations through the chassis around the
base of the capacitor. A similar procedure
can be followed in the case of heat-pro-
ducing components which, for electrical
or mechanical reasons, must be mounted
beneath the chassis. Variations of this
general method can be followed to estab-
lish the desired air-flow pattern in other
forms of electronic equipment construc-
tion.
The above method of applying forced
convection was developed and evaluated
experimentally on a console containing a
number of conventional components as-
sembled using standard chassis construc-
tion. It was determined that all com-
ponents could be kept within safe oper-
ating temperatures with cooling air at an
inlet temperature of 43°C. An air tem-
perature rise of 10°C was obtained using
an air flow rate of approximately 200
cubic feet per minute. Electrical power
input to the console was about 1200
watts. The console was completely closed
and insulated to reduce the interchange
of heat between the console and its en-
vironment. An air-to-liquid heat ex-
changer served to transfer heat from the
circulating air to a flow of cooling water.
By measuring the flow rate and temper-
ature rise of the cooling water, the quan-
tity of heat removed by the cooling sys-
tem could be calculated. A comparison
between this quantity and the electrical
power input provided a measure of the
overall thermal efficiency. It was found
that the cooling system removed 72 per-
cent of the heat produced within the con-
sole.

What Will Be the Effects on Labor?
Composition
Automation is strengthening an al-
ready evident trend in the United States,
a trend of expanding opportunity for
those with industrial and professional
skills and, relatively, of contracting op-
portunity for the unskilled. It may sound
like a paradox, but is very true, that
the more nearly automated a plant is, the
more will people be the one scarce re-
source—electronic engineers rather than
skilled metalworkers, supervisors with
analytical ability rather than a flair for
human relations, and top managers who
can make and be responsible for deci-
sions for years to come rather than be
judged on their record.1"
Because of this increased demand for
higher degrees of skill for many of the
new jobs and for greater versatility on
the job, training and retraining will need
to be developed considerably beyond their
present levels. Recognition of these train-
ing costs caused Peter Drucker to say that
"Automation forces management to look
on the employee as a capital resource and
on labor costs as capital costs." 17
"Automation will put the skill back
into labor. Changes in skill level mean
that different people will be recruited,
trained differently, and rewarded differ-
ently. The consequence most to be ex-
pected is that labor, like management,
will become professionalized." 18
Labor-Management Relations
As the supervisory relationship between
management and labor becomes less evi-
dent we may find them drawing closer to-
gether. In the future, higher incomes for
workers will be restricted by (1) the rise
in productive efficiency; and (2) the effi-
cient and full utilization of capacity. This,
in turn, challenges the labor leaders to
replace their traditional policy of higher
wages and better working conditions—
which management describes as a policy
of more pay for less work—with a
dynamic policy of higher pay for more
production. Payment will not be by
piece rate. It may reflect the output of a
team or a factory. It may be based on
50
something other than output, for example,
degre;- of machine utilization.
Employers will become increasingly in-
terested in using 2 or more shifts, with
periodic maintenance shut-downs, due to
fast obsolescence and large capital outlays.
Maintenance workers assume more im-
portance since the economic advantage
obtained by the use of this equipment de-
pends primarily on keeping the process
going.
Management must put emphasis on
the importance of planning manpower
requirements. This is partly because of
changing needs but particularly because
technical and scientific manpower is in
short supply. It is also because manage-
ment has a special responsibility to plan
its requirements in advance in order to
soften the impact of technological changes
on labor.
Displacement of Labor
Human anxiety concerning automation
has centered on the displacement of di-
rect labor with machines. Whether or not
founded on fact, the fears expressed in
word or deed about the impact of auto-
mation are very real. They are based on
the knowledge—confirmed by the ex-
periences of the past—that some people
will be affected adversely by technologi-
cal change even if in the long run so-
ciety as a whole benefits from it.
As John Dicbold wrote:
"Fundamental to the successful in-
tegration of automation into our
mechanized society is the recog-
nition by all parties concerned—
unions, management, and govern-
ment—that they have a common in-
terest. No one, least of all the Amer-
ican businessman, wants to sec-
increased unemployment. All of us
stand to gain by automation as long
as we stand together." lu
Although automation may displace di-
rect labor in a given factory, it tends
to increase the need for maintenance and
engineering employees. Whole new ter-
tiary industries have sprung up to sup-
ply and service automation equipment.
Estimates of the actual labor force to
be replaced by automation are consistently
small. Paul W. Cook, Jr., estimates that
more people quit their jobs in a month
now than would be replaced in a year-'
Although it is hard to placate a man
who has lost his job to automation by
telling him of its overall benefit to so
ciety, there is no intrinsic reason to as-
sociate shifting opportunity with unem-
ployment. Management should share its
plans with the workers, to keep them in-
formed of the new techniques that will
affect their continued employment—the
need for dismissals, transfers, training,
opportunities for promotion, and to plan
ways of making the change.
The Subcommittee on Economic Stabili-
zation recommended in 1955 that:
1. Public and private sources should
do everything possible to main-
tain a healthy, dynamic economy
so that displaced workers would
have job opportunities.
2. Education should be promoted to
provide the type of workers auto-
mation will need.
3. Local unemployment pockets
should be eliminated as far as
possible through management re-
training and job relocation aid.-1
What Are the Implications for
Society?
Acceptance of a new concept or of a
new method or of a new product is al-
ways resisted. Humans are creatures of
habit and don't want their habits dis-
turbed. Opposition is not likely to do
more than slow progress, however. The
following quotation suggests the short-
sightedness of opposing automation.
'There are some who would slow
the continuing process of taking dull
and laborious work off the backs and
minds of men and transferring it to
machines. In doing so, they might
make the world safe for those with
no skill. The far more constructive
course is to welcome the expanding
opportunities now .being provided

Here are the results of the
questionnaires sent to various
faculty members to discover
their reasons for choosing edu-
cation.
by LARRY SELWITZ, '59E
Recently the Technic sent question-
naires to various members of the
engineering college faculty, asking two
leading questions: first, "What motivated
you, as an engineer, to enter the field of
education?" and secondly, "What ad-
vantages and disadvantages have you en-
countered as a result of this decision?"
The replies, when summed up, were en-
lightening, although not totally unex-
pected.
It must be first mentioned that the mo-
tivating factors for entering education
were not necessarily the same as the ad-
vantages listed of the field itself. Al-
though in many cases there was an over-
lapping of the two, most of the faculty
members answering our query gave dis-
tinctly different causes for entering the
educational field from those advantages
encountered during their teaching tenure.
Reasons given for initially entering the
educational field were mainly based on
necessity. A few individuals stated that
they sought experience and financial as-
sistance while doing graduate work, and
welcomed the opportunity to teach as a
means of accomplishing this end.
One professor's parents were both edu-
cators, and as a result, his decision to be-
come an educator was influenced by his
early environment. One other professor
entered the teaching ranks quite acci-
dentally, deciding, among other things,
to give teaching a try.
Often mentioned as the main cause for
becoming a teacher was a strong desire
to teach. However, it should be noted that
the desire to teach in most cases was no
greater than the desire to do research or
other related scientific and engineering
jobs. Many of the replies mentioned a
strong leaning on the part of the indi-
vidual toward mathematics and engineer-
ing, hence the reason for obtaining engi-
neering degrees rather than educational
degrees.
This leads to perhaps the basic motiva-
tion for entering the educational profes-
sion: the chance to work in an atmosphere
where both the desire to teach and the
opportunity to further one's scientific and
engineering endeavors could find freedom
of expression. This leads to a correspond-
ing motivation for entering the realm
of the university: dissatisfaction of the
industrial environment.
It might be well to mention here that
all reference to teaching and education is
strictly within the realm of faculty status
at engineering college, or with the engi-
neering school of a university. In general,
most of the replies were given with the
University of Michigan in mind.
Most of those who stated outright that
they turned to teaching because of a
strong desire to teach further replied that
they would rather work with people than
things.
Hand-in-hand with this desire to work
with people is the desire to communicate
with the student, and pass on knowledge
to the student for the latter's betterment.
If we must draw a line between the an-
swers to question one and question two,
this would have to be the logical point,
for all the listed information given us
that follows definitely constitutes the ad-
vantages encountered while on the job as
a teacher.
Almost 100% of the replies told of the
feeling of satisfaction obtained in help-
ing others acquire new skills and new
knowledge. As one professor remarked:
". . . to see a student progress in your
caurse aand perhaps to see him make a
success in later life is a satisfaction of
the human spirit that is difficult to equal
in other fields of endeavor."
Aside from the feeling of accomplish-
ment from teaching itself, the next most
mentioned advantage was the atmosphere
of university life, such as flexibility of
working schedule, freedom of intellectual
inquiry, freedom of action in daily work.
and the opportunity to further one's edu
cation on the job. As one professor
noted: ... "a college professor must
never allow himself to become narrow."
Most of the faculty gave recognition to
the fact that the intellectual stimulation
of a campus offered attraction beyond tk
scope of industrial situations.
In evaluating the advantages offered
by the field of education as opposed to
industry, it should be realized that teach
ing does not necessarily mean a divorce
from research and consultation work On
the contrary, such pursuits are actively
encouraged by the university on the part
of every member of the engineering fac-
ulty. One professor would like it known
that "one by no means gives up engi-
neering' on entering 'education.' He con-
siders the blend of consultation, research,
teaching, and summer work a situation of
"having your cake and eating it, too'
It is most significant to look at the
listed disadvantages, for they fall into
two categories: financial, and everything
else. While the positive arguments for
education as a career were both varied
and numerous, every reply had one na-
tive argument in common, that of the cor
respondingly less pay than in industry
This, it seems, is the main hazard of the
occupation.
However, it was the general consensus
of all those who replied to our question-
naire, that the advantages far outweighed
the disadvantages of low salary.

What does an engineering department head do? How does
he feel concerning certain academic curiosities that the under-
graduate wonders about? A talk with the Chairman of the
Mechanical Engineering Department and of the Industrial Engi-
neering Department spreads some interesting light on the sub-
ject.
The Technic has ever felt that there
should be a close relationship be-
tween faculty and students, and that
the time will never come when this re-
lationship cannot be improved. It was
with this thought in mind that the au-
thors decided on an article of this scope.
One afternoon last November, we
caught Professor Wyeth Allen, Chairman
of the Department of Mechanical Engi-
neering and Chairman of the Department
of Industrial Engineering, during one of
his few spare moments. We chatted about
everything that might reciprocally interest
the student and the faculty. In fact, those
"few spare moments" soon widened to
more than 2 hours, and, although we had
by no means exhausted our conversation,
we did feel we had accomplished our
primary aim. It might be well to point
out one fact before we progress; that we
spoke to Professor Allen, rather than any
other department head, should not alter
the impact of the subject matter in the
slightest. The points we discussed and
the answers we obtained would have been
unchanged had we spoken to other men
in similar positions.
To start the conversation moving, we
stated that the students have a few
gripes about school and that we'd like
to talk them over. There was no doubt
about it; things did start moving—and
fast. In a bolt that was definitely much
faster than light, we were flattened in
our seats. That is to say that Professor
Allen didn't agree wholly with our state-
ment. The discussion was on, and it
soon proved to be most interesting. The
Professor felt that the student gripes
about many things are due to their not
having complete knowledge of the over-
all situation.
Somehow we strayed onto the topic
of courses which are taught outside the
College of Engineering such as Math,
Physics, Chemistry, etc. . . Profesor Allen,
who has worked in industry for many
years, asked us how often we thought
most engineers would use as theoretical a
subject as Calculus after graduation.
We took a stab and answered "Probably
not very often." The answer was absolu-
tely correct with certain qualifications.
Yet, what engineering curriculum doesn't
require at least the inclusion of one Cal-
culus course in the required math se-
quence?
Professor Allen insisted that the in-
clusion of such theoretical courses which
may never be used directly by the prac-
ticing engineer is entirely necessary. One
obvious reason why such theoretical sub-
jects are included, and possibly will even
be given greater emphasis in the near
future, is the extensive use made of it by
some engineers such as those basic engi-
neers engaged in research, computer de-
velopment, missile design and control,
and other such fields.
But whether or not theoretical course
material is used in engineering there is a
second and more significant purpose for
the emphasis of it in the college educa-
tion. The engineering school's aim is not
to teach a string of formulae and unre-
lated numbers which will soon be forgot-
ten, but rather to teach the engineer to
use a method of thinking which will re-
main with him throughout his life. This
is the system of analysis first, then syn-
thesis, a system so vital to engineering,
and so useful in other fields as well. Be-
cause of it the engineering graduate is so
often able to move into other fields with
great success.
At this point the discussion changed
pace somewhat and delved into the
problems of setting up and administering
a curriculum. We, as students, take all
this for granted and complain to boot
without ever realizing the long hours of
hard work that go into programming a
schedule. Whenever a curriculum is
started from scratch, such as the new
Science program, or overhauled, such as
the Industrial, a committee first makes a
thorough study of the courses offered by
other schools in the country. This is one
more example of the engineer's method of
analysis, then synthesis; even though a
course is not to be revamped, it is con-
tinuously reviewed by committees, and
the text changed as progress warrants. As
Professor Allen stated, "If an engineering
course remains unchanged over a period
of five years, something must be wrong
with it."
Just as a committee decides the text
used by an instructor, so the department
chairman determines his minimum num-
ber of consultation hours per week (4, for
example, for the faculty of the Depart-
ments of Mechanical and Industrial Engi-
neering), during which he must be
available to his students. The Technic
is considering printing these consulta-
tion hours each semester.
It is interesting to note that the weekly
class hours of the instructors vary from
as few as 4 or 5 for part time to as many
as 18 or 20 for full time. This variance
can be explained by examining the activi-
ties in which some of the faculty mem-
bers are engaged for the betterment of
the College of Engineering. Often these
other duties require more time than a
full teaching schedule; besides classroom
instruction faculty members may be en-
gaged in industrial or pure research, or
may be active on a number of faculty
committees. Still others are concerned
with more specialized areas, such as our
Dearborn branch, or the Japanese coop-
erative exchange program.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


members of the Michigan Technic. Hilburger comes to Michigan from Williamsville, New York, where
he was photo editor of his high school yearbook and a member of the Science Club and National Foren-
sic Society. He is presently working for his B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering and is a member of
Chi Phi. Bert is Articles Editor of this year's Technic.
Howard Urow is Associate Editor and comes from Chicago. Here at the University, Howie is work-
ing toward his degree in Industrial Engineering in June of 1958. Outstanding among his college activities
are such engineering organizations as: Vulcans, Alpha Pi Mu (president), and Tau Beta Pi. He also be-
longs to Alpha Epsilon Pi social fraternity.
This month's article is the end result of an interview Professor Allen, head of the ME and IE de-
partments.
Much more time and effort than most
people realize is spent in these two spec-
ialized areas. In the establishment of the
Dearborn Center, for instance, a major
problem is to set up and maintain
courses and curricula among the two
campuses so that the same graduation re-
quirements exist. To accomplish the best
results in undertaking to create this Dear-
born campus, the possibility of having
some faculty members teach on both cam-
puses must be considered. Further com-
plications occur in the branch's curricula
due to the introduction of the quarter
system under the cooperative plan.
In the College's program of mutual ex-
change of faculty members with the
Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan, one
can well imagine how problems may arise.
All of these matters must be dealt
with by the department heads and with
the aid of some of their faculty mem-
ber's time and resourcefulness. However,
none of this work on the outside is sup-
posed to interfere with the instructors'
classroom preparations or the attention
they give their students. The number of
class hours per week is purposely ad-
justed for each member of the faculty to
avoid such an interference. Each member
of the faculty is required to fill out and
submit to the head of his department a
Form B each semester (see illustration).
This familiarizes the department head
with the activities of each man under
his supervision. The pegboard shown in
illustration also helps the department
head keep track of the faculty members'
labs, recitations, and consultation hours.
Many forms, systems, and procedures
are vital to the efficient operation of a
department of as large an educational
institution as this college of engineering.
In order not to expend effort unnecessar-
ily or without the proper authority and
approval, certain regulations must be
recognized. This, however, leads to an
unusually long time lapse between the
conception of ideas and their materializa-
tion. The printing of schedules alone in-
volved in handling the number of courses
offered require that, for example, the
courses and the class hours offered during
the following summer's session be ar-
ranged as early as November. This time
element is the primary reason for the
departments being unable to list an in-
structor opposite each class hour in the
time schedule. To correct this situation, an
effort is being made by the department
offices to post the instructors for the class
hours on each department's bulletin
boards shortly before registration time
each semester.
Another factor contributing to this
necessity of planning well ahead of ex-
pected accomplishment is the requirement
of getting agreement among a number
of faculty groups and individuals. This
task becomes more difficult as the size
of the faculty increases. For instance, it is
now possible to have only two full fac-
ulty meetings a year.
Faculty Evaluation
The size of the faculty presents an in-
teresting problem to the department chair-
men—a problem for which the students
often have trouble in conceiving the same
solution as that of the department heads.
That problem is faculty evaluation.
Faculty members are constantly being
evaluated by their respective department
chairmen. Evaluation is not periodic or
specific, but rather is the result of the
many ways in which the department
heads communicate with the faculty mem-
bers. Often a great deal can be deter-
mined from personal talks during which
the faculty member's reaction to sug-
gestions or opinions of the department
head is observed. It is also through this
medium that the instructor presents any
problems confronting him or any sug-
gestions which he believes may improve
some courses. All this reflects the instruc-
tor's effectiveness as an educator.
A second medium of evaluation is the
staff meetings where items of a broader
scope are considered. It is hoped that
complete freedom of expression prevails
during these meetings, and often a great
deal is brought out through lively dis-
cussion.
Possibly the most concrete method of
evaluation available is student evalua-
tion. Only those instructors who request
evaluation have their students fill out the
forms. However, many that do proceed
with this evaluation carry it one step
further, and discuss the more prevalent
points with other instructors or with
their different department heads. Thus
the department heads can obtain a fur-
ther evaluation of their faculty members.
All elements of this department head-
faculty-student relationship make one
school more highly ranked by the public
and industry than another. Often we
lose sight of our ECPD (Engineering
Council for Professional Development)
accreditation. This accreditation, how-
ever, is very important to the graduate
engineer seeking employment, and is no
easy matter to maintain without constant
effort. Either the College of Engineering
must improve or slip down. There is no
such thing as maintaining the status
quo in today's fast-stepping world. Not
only the department heads, but the stu-
dents and faculty as well are responsible
to the University to uphold its established
standards.

to us . . . the situation is getting worse,
not better."
"Getting back to communication—so
often information concerning the job is
hoarded by a section, rather than passing
it to all sections within a division and
also to all divisions within the depart-
ment. So often one section acquires a
feeling of importance to the Company
and sorts out the useful information and
keeps it as its own. However, this sec-
tion that has acquired so much self-
importance should be made to realize
that the company is not resting on its
shoulders. To get the maximum effi-
ciency, all sections, all divisions within
the Engineering Department must work
as a team. This can be done only if all
sections receive all the information avail-
able. With the various duplicating proc-
esses available to the engineers, there is
no reason why copies of important infor-
mation cannot be made and the original
passed on."
Supervision
"I would like to know more about
company policies but the questions I
want to ask I don't want to ask of my
immediate supervisor in view of the
fact that he would often be the subject
of those questions. Now if you don't
mind, I'd like to make a little speech.
Regardless of what higher management
says or would like to see done, the
'bloke' I and all the other employees
have to please is the immediate super-
visor. Regardless of how much training
you give the immediate supervisor, he
can still be a lemon when it comes to
handling people. And when you get
stuck working for a lemon it isn't much
fun going to work. I wish I could like
my job but I just can't because of the
boss I've got, and I know plenty other
people in the same boat. I want to make
this one recommendation: Don't make
an employee work for the same boss
more than four years. Give him a chance
to change jobs or change the boss. I've
worked at my present job for five years
now and my boss never consults me on
anything regarding how the job should
be done. He makes arbitrary decisions
and lets me know about it in such a way
that I cannot question the decision with-
out looking like I'm questioning his
authority. Let's give the employees more
chances to change posses. This com-
pany treats its employees swell and I
mean it."
"It is difficult to get a decision from
my supervisor. Since he moved into a
private office he has lost contact with
his people, their problems, and their
work. He no longer knows the produc-
tion or the capabilities of his people. He
tries to apply the Human Relations
touch but misses in practice. The respon-
sibility of his job and the problems in
it are getting beyond him, while be
buries himself in clerical and useless
details."
Personal Satisfaction
"I feel that my present job has small
chance of advancement."
"There is a lot of work a supervisor
is asked to do these days—reports and
things of that sort that could be dele-
gated to a clerk in an office or some-
thing of that sort so the supervisor is
out with his men and associating with
them and training them. I think in the
long run it would be a lot better."
Satisfaction with Authority
"The most important lack in incentive
to do a good job is that nearly every-
thing done must be approved by someone
above. I would suggest that every em-
ployee down to messenger boy or girl
should have at least one thing that he or
she can run with no reversals from above.
I believe many employees go into outside
activities (lodge, boy scouts, etc.) so they
can be a 'big shot' somewhere. Work
should give this opportunity."
"My main 'gripe' and only real dis-
satisfaction is that my hands are often
tied for the lack of a policy decision
from my immediate supervisor."
"It seems to me that a better over-all
job could be done if every level of super-
vision was given greater leeway in mak-
ing decisions, given more authority with
assurance that the higher supervision
would not reverse or criticize unduly
In general, we have capable, sincere
employees in supervisory jobs but thn
are seldom able to do their best job
because of this restriction."
Good engineering work requires top
performance by everyone. This can only
be obtained by engineer supervisors who
have plus attitudes and who know and
practice the human art of being a good
boss. The most successful of such super-
visors will be the ones who give their
subordinates the opportunity and tam-
ing to be as good bosses as the)- are
engineers.
Developing Better Managers
No engineer, nor anyone else, will
ever be developed for management re-
sponsibilities by sitting still and expect-
ing someone else to do it for him. Pre-
paration for positions of leadership is.
to a large extent, an individual responsi-
bility. However, management has the
obligation to provide the climate and
opportunity for the engineer to develop
himself if he chooses to do so.
William B. Given, Jr., in the Harvard
Business Review (January-February
1955) writing under the title "The Engi-
neer Goes Into Management," expresses
very well, in my judgment, the problems
we sometimes make for ourselves in set-
ting the kind of climate I have in mind.
I quote from his article as follows:
"The fact that so many men trained
in engineering are classified as being
unable to become top notch executives is
not entirely their own fault. Thousands
of good engineers have been hired im-
personally by personnel Departments of
large organizations to fill jobs behind
drafting boards or test tubes. Undoubt-
edly, many potential business leaders
have become buried because manage-
ment did not take the time or did not
care to know and evaluate these people
While it is certainly up to each engineer
to keep his eyes open, it is also a duty
of the company itself to teach him what
other things besides his daily engineer-
ing tasks are important.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Where young men work on big jobs
It takes a lot more than electronic calculators
and push buttons to run a big refinery like ours
at Whiting. It takes scientifically trained and
skilled men. Take, for example, Bill Nemec, who
shares in the responsibilities of our Refinery
Economics Division Technical Service group.
A chemical engineer, Bill came to us from
the University of Michigan. He and his associ-
ates work on problems involving chemical
engineering, economics, cost control and sound
advance planning. Facing new situations daily,
they work with many people in the Research
Center and in the refinery. As a result, they
gain an ever-widening knowledge of refinery
operations.
Sound interesting? Bill Nemec is one of hun-
dreds of young men with widely varied back-
grounds, talents and responsibilities building
careers at Standard Oil's progressive Whiting,
Indiana, laboratories.

(Continued from page iS)
"I think it is only after the engineer
becomes lost in his daily formulas and
tables and designs that he becomes the
'typical engineer.' If he is not exposed
to the problems of management and
does not get an opportunity to know ot
or work at other than his engineering
work, he probably will become, con-
sciously or unconsciously, too much of
an 'engineer only' ever to succeed in
management."
We are taking major steps to provide
a proper climate for self-development. I
think they can be grouped in four gen-
eral categories as follows:
1. Activities associated with the im-
provement of attitudes.
2. Analysis of job content to make
certain the job an engineer is assigned
will offer a challenge to his abilities.
3. Analysis of organizational struc-
ture to be sure it fosters maximum job
effectiveness and development of people.
4. Training in the broad field of man-
agement responsibility.
Attitude Improvement
The degree of success we attain in
molding favorable attitudes depends, in
large measure, on our attention to hu-
man values in the day-to-day job. An
engineer like anyone else, must accom-
plish his objectives through people. Some
of the steps we have taken in this field
are as follows:
1. In the broad field of human rela-
tions—
a. All engineers are included in dis-
cussion groups on human relations in
management.
b. Considerable effort is placed on
improved communication both up and
down the line. Samples of what is done
are:
(1) On a rotational basis District
Heads are invited to attend the
weekly meetings of the Chief En-
gineer and his Division Heads.
(2) Departmental meetings with
management personnel are held in
small groups at which time depart-
mental policy is developed through
discussion.
(3) Steps are taken to see that each
member of the Department is kept
advised of all items of general in-
terest.
(4) An Open House was held for
the families of members of the En-
gineering Department. Demonstra-
tions were made of the types of
work done. This gave employees'
families some familiarity with the
work, as well as an opportunity to
meet members of the Department.
c. The personal and professional in-
terests of the engineers are promoted
in every practical way—emphasis is
placed on treating each engineer as
an individual and as a member of
management.
d. A carefully supervised plan of
rotational training, far more extensive
than previously used, has been intro-
duced.
c. The open door policy is empha-
sized from top to bottom so that each
member of the Department feels free
to ask any questions or discuss any
problems. Conscious effort is directed
toward having supervision friendly
and helpful at all times,
f. Training in talking with people in
the understanding-listening technicjue
is given to all personnel.
2. Authority is delegated along with
responsibility. This points up the fact
that the engineer is a member of the
management team even though he might
have no one reporting to him. He is
given the authority to make decisions
within certain limits. If questions arise
about his jobs he is called in and be-
comes a party to any changes that are
made.
3. Salary treatment for each engineer
is closely watched. Outstanding indi-
viduals are given appropriate recognition.
Analysis of Job Content
Cases were found where engineers
were overloaded with work of a routine
nature—where we were not making full
use of their talents. Two important steps
were taken—
1. Jobs were analyzed to determine
if an engineer was required or whether
the job could be done by a technician.
2. Engineers, where necessary, were
given clerical assistants or access to a
clerical pool to handle the large volume
of clerical work that is associated with
any engineering project. This left ths
engineers largely free for creative en-
gineering work. Of course, any man-
ager, no matter in what level of the or-
ganization, has to spend some time on
work of a routine nature.
The September 7, 1956 issue of the
Wall Street Journal has a lead article
under the heading "Brain Conservation
—Firms Battle to Take Administrative
Chores Off Creative Engineers." This
describes specific steps being taken by
International Business Machines, General
Electric, DuPont and others to resolve
the serious problem of engineer short-
age by freeing engineers from non-tech-
nical work and by training technicians
to take over non-creative tasks. As you
know, this is an important problem in
industry today.
Analysis or Organizational Structure
Activity in this field involved such
things as the following:
1. The number of people reportins:
to each supervisor was reviewed and in
some cases reductions were made.
2. Engineers, where warranted, were
placed as supervisors of technicians and
clerks.
3. Specialists, who of course fill a
very important role, were placed in the
category of consultants for the entire
department.
4. Job assignments, where practicable,
were made on a geographic or other basis
which would provide proprietorship and
identification with management.
Training in Management Responsibility
The System has undertaken a program
of management development, with which
you may be familiar, called the Bell Sys-
tem Executive Conference. It is located
at Asbury Park, New Jersey. This con-
ference involves a four week program

The Importance of
DIGITAL TECHNIQUES
Digital techniques constitute one of the important devel-
opments which have made possible the recent advances in
computers and related equipment for computation, data
processing, and industrial and military electronic control.
Digital computers for scientific computation range from
small specialized units costing a few thousand dollars, to
large general-purpose computers costing over a million
dollars. One of these large computers is a part of the Ramo-
Wooldridge Computing Center, and a second such unit is
being installed early this year.
Electronic data processing for business and industry is
rapidly growing based on earlier developments in electronic
computers. Data processors have much in common with
computers, including the utilization of digital techniques. A
closely related field is that of industrial process control. To
meet the needs in this field, Ramo-Wooldridge has recently
put on the market the RW-300 Digital Control Computer.
The use of digital techniques in military control systems
is an accomplished fact. Modern interceptor aircraft, for
example, use digital fire control systems. A number of Ramo-
Wooldridge scientists and engineers have pioneered in this
field, and the photograph above shows the RW-30 Airborne
Digital Computer.
The RW-30 is an example of what can be accomplished
through the application of digital techniques in conjunction
with modern semiconductor components. It performs com-
plete mathematical operations, including multiplications, at
the rate of 4000 per second (as fast as large scientific com-
puters). Yet it occupies only 4.19 cubic feet, weighs 203
pounds and uses 400 watts power. It is packaged in four
separate units to facilitate installation in aircraft. The mag-
netic drum memory has a capacity of 2607 21-bit words.
The versatility inherent in digital techniques makes it pos-
sible for the RW-30 to handle such varied military aircraft
problems as navigation, armament control and bombing, and
combinations of these problems, without changes in the
RW-30 itself.
The RW-30 also serves to illustrate the balanced integra-
tion of systems analysis and product engineering which is a
principal objective at Ramo-Wooldridge. Similar programs
are in progress on other airborne and electronic control sys-
tems, communication and navigation systems, and electronic
instrumentation and test equipment. Engineers and scientists
are invited to explore openings in these fields at Ramo-
Wooldridge.

and all department head personnel, such
as Chief Engineer, are included. It has
been underway for about three years.
In addition, certain of the operating
Companies have introduced a program
of development conferences for levels
of management below department head
including newly employed college gradu-
ates. My Company (I.B.T.) has under-
taken such a program which covers a
two week period. The conferees during
the fall, winter, and spring are brought
together at Chicago. During this past
summer we experimented with a different
environment by holding the conferences
at Knox College at Galesburg. These con-
ferences were described in the August 25,
1956 issue of Business Week under the
title "The Boss Moves Into the Dorm."
The major purposes of the develop-
ment conferences are:
1. To broaden the thinking and the
outlook of telephone management people.
2. To increase their present effective-
ness.
3. To stimulate their interest in further
self-development.
4. To induct newly appointed man-
agement people.
At the end of every conference, each
participant fills out a questionnaire,
which is anonymous, commenting on the
program. I thought you might be inter-
ested in a few of the types of comments
that recur frequently.
"I thought I knew the answers before,
but after listening to the other fellows
in discussions, I realized there was much
more to the problems than I saw."
"The greatest help I got out of the
Conference was a chance to school my-
self and learn when to listen and when
to speak my piece."
"With this experience I feel I can
work more effectively with others, and
also use better judgment in preventing
and solving human relations problems.
It started a new line of thinking for me."
"Another value, to me, of the Confer-
ence was the association with other de-
partments. It gave us an opportunity to
learn more about how the other depart-
ments function. I hope the Development
Conference will continue."
Based on the results to date there is
no question but that this training has
substantially broadened the outlook of
the participants and laid the groundwork
for a more capable management in the fu-
ture.
Measurement of the Results
The programs to increase managerial
ability and improve attitudes did not
come into being all at once. We have
always had activities of that character
under way. However, the tremendous
problems we have faced during the past
ten years, resulting from a rapid growth
in the demand for communication serv-
ices, the introduction of a stream of
technological improvements, a substan-
tial increase in the requirement for
supervisory personnel and a general short-
age of people for all types of jobs,
pointed up the fact that additional em-
phasis must be placed on the develop-
ment of managers. As a result, many of
the things I referred to were introduced
in recent years.
To repeat, we feel that attitudes repre-
sent the critical factor in being a good
boss—also, attitudes are susceptible to
measurement. You saw a few minutes ago
what measurement in this field showed
for an Engineering Department, an Op-
erating Department and a Company in
1952. Now I would like to show you
the results from the same questionnaire
for the same department and company
taken three years later.
Referring to the chart; of much inter-
est is the fact that the General Manage-
ment Attitude of the Engineering De-
partment is now above the score of the
total company. Giving some allowance
to the fact that the Company figures rep-
resent a more diverse group of People,
the company indicates that relatively
lower scoring in the Enginering De-
partment is largely confined to one cate-
gory. Pride in Company. This is more
than offset by the strong scoring in
Identification with Management, Satis-
faction with Authority, Support of Com-
pany Plans and Objectives and Responsi-
bility for Profits. By superimposing scores
of the same Operating Department a
before you will note comparable results—
The Engineering Department now scores
higher than the Operating Department in
the critical measurement, General Man-
agement Attitude.
With reference to the scoring on Pride
in Company, this category is composed
of five questions. Four relate to off-the-
job conversations on telephone matters
with friends who do not work for the
Company. The key question from the
engineer's point of view is the fifth one
which asks "How much pride do you
have in working for the company?
As 88% of the engineers answered it by
saying "a great deal" we believe we are
well on our way toward achieving ac-
ceptable results in this important area.
If we superimpose the 1952 score for
the Engineering Department on the 1955
score you can see substantial progress
has been made. This indicates dearly
that it is possible to improve attitudes.
There is no question but that the Depart-
ment today is doing a far more effectire
job, and the people in it are being better
developed to assume positions of added
responsibility.
You have seen from this study what
we expect in my business of engineers
as managers and supervisors, problems
we found in developing engineers to be-
come managers and supervisors how we
exposed these problems with attitude
research and measurement, what we are
doing to solve them and how it is paying
off. Of course, we still have problems in
developing management personnel—and
we'll always have them as long as we
continue to grow as a company. ^{
recognize, too, that there may be several
roads to their solution—that each may
be equally good. But we'll continue to
study—experiment—and measure these
many routes in an effort to more nearly
reach perfection in developing the good
engineer and the good engineering be*

net-ring laboratory was very apparent.
Already the State Legislature had appro-
priated $2500 for a mechanical labora-
tory in connection with the Department
of Civil Engineering with the stipulation
that if it was not used by January 1,
1882, it would revert to the State Treas-
ury. The Department of Civil Engineer-
ing was not ready to make this expendi-
ture, and it was suggested that the 2500
construction was begun in December,
1881. The building had two stories and
was twenty-four feet wide and thirty-six
feet long. It was of frame construction
and sheathed with brick placed edgewise
between the studding. It was located just
south of the Clock Tower of the later
shops, which were recently removed to
permit constiuction of the new Under-
graduate Library.

became a private residence. It is of in-

Cooky was the only mechanical engineer

and equipping it as a mechanical engi-
neering laboratory. At first, $2500 seem-
ed far too small an amount for such a
purpose, but it was decided to go ahead
with the project and spend $1500 for a
building and $1000 for equipment. The
building was erected, and after much
delay in receiving equipment from the
manufacturers, the Mechanical Labora-
tory was opened at the beginning of the
second semester in 1882.
J. B. Davis prepared the plans for the

In 1883, a temporary joinder's shop
used by the contractor for the new Li-
brary building, together with its equip-
ment was given to the Department of
Mechanical Engineering and in June,
1884, the Steward reported that the
joiner's shop had been moved and con-
nected with the Mechanical Laboratory
at a cost of $600 and that it was "a great
addition and convenience to this worthy
but poorly equipped department." This
building was sold in 1887. The bricks
were removed and it was moved to the
southwest corner of North University
U. S. Navy. By this time, several addi-
tional courses had been included in the
mechanical engineering curriculum, all
but two of which were taught by Pro-
fessor Cooley.
In 1885, the Regents authorized a new
mechanical laboratory, and it was re-
solved:

Weapons Systems Responsibility
In the development of guided missile
systems, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
maintains a complete and broad respon-
sibility. From the earliest conception to
production engineering—from research
and development in electronics, guidance,
aerodynamics, structures and propulsion,
through field testing problems and actual
troop use, full technical responsibility rests
with JPL engineers and scientists.
The Laboratory is not only responsible for
the missile system itself, including guid-
ance, propulsion and airframe, but for all
ground handling equipment necessary to
insure a complete tactical weapons system.
One outstanding product of this type of
systems responsibility is the "Corporal,"
a highly accurate surface-to-surface ballis-
tic missile. This weapon, developed by JPL,
and now in production elsewhere, can be
found "on active service" wherever needed
in the American defense pattern.
A prime attraction for scientists and
engineers at JPL is the exceptional oppor-
tunity provided for original research
afforded by close integration with vital and
forward-looking programs. The Laboratory
now has important positions open for
qualified applicants for such interesting
and challenging activities.

and be sure that the nation's young
people are prepared to take ad-
vantage of them." M
Labor unions have long been opposed
to any change that might displace work-
ers. For quite some time labor has been
vociferous in its denunciation of auto-
mation. Recently, however, the leaders
have come around to see benefits of
automation accruing to their workers. A
London union president made these re-
marks: "To fear automation would be the
cowardly approach; it could arise only
from a sense of weakness. If we are con-
fident in our strength as workers and in
our workers' organizations—and we
should be—we have no need to fear. We
should immediately set ourselves to the
task of controlling these developments,
not restricting them; of turning them
to our advantage and not our disad-
vantage." 23
As a final and far-reaching thought,
automation must always be considered in
proper relation to mankind. F. G. Wol-
lard puts apt emphasis on this relation-
ship:
"We must always remember tthat
automation is not a device with
which to outlaw, displace, or dis-
pense with man. It is not a con-
trivance nor an invention to deprive
man of his heritage—his right to
work and to enjoy the fruits of his
labours. It is a means of increasing
man's stature and of extending his
ability to do more and more useful
work; to produce in greater vol-
ume with less physical effort or
mental strain—a means whereby he
can bring to his fellows the fulfil-
ment of their lawful desires and, to
their homes, comfort and leisure.
We must always remember that men
were not made for machines, but that
machines were made for men. What-
ever device or emblem we may
adopt to typify "automation" the
motto must be . . . 'Machines in the
Service of Man'." 24

Why Vought Projects
Bring Out The Best
In An Engineer
At Vought, the engineer doesn't often
forget past assignments. Like all big
events, they leave vivid memories.
And it's no wonder.
For here the engineer contributes to
history-making projects — among
them the record-breaking Crusader
fighter; the Regulus II missile, chosen
to arm our newest nuclear subs; and
the new fast-developing 1,500-plus-
mph fighter, details of which are still
classified.
The Vought engineer watches such
weapons take shape. He supervises
critical tests, and he introduces the
weapons to the men with whom they
will serve.
Engineers with many specialties share
these experiences. Today, for exam-
ple, Vought is at work on important
projects involving:
electronics design and manufacture
inertial navigation
investigation of advanced propulsion
methods
Mach 5 configurations
Vought's excellent R&amp;D facilities
help the engineer through unexplored
areas. And by teaming up with other
specialists against mutual challenges,
the Vought engineer learns new fields
while advancing in his own.

Another month, another set of prob-
lems. Oh well, there will be a few
different sets of answers, too, so it all
balances out for the month. But why
waste time talking? Let's get started!
Now, for the next teaser, refer to
Figure 1. This rectangle was supposed
to be a square, but somebody erred in its
construction. Haunted by the thought of
such a mistake, he took ruler and pen and
started crossing it out. However, by cut-
ting along two of his newly drawn lines,
he was able to rearrange its parts to
form the required square. Why don't you
try it? (Caution—An ex-staff member
once cut the thing out eight different
ways before getting it right. He now
cuts out paper dolls.)

Let us borrow our first gem from an
unknown zoology class. Take the case of
some organism which divides (it can't
add or subtract, but multiplies by divid-
ing) into two such organisms 365 times
per annum (non leapum). On the first
three thousand five hundred and twenty-
fourth part of the century to be consid-
ered our specimen numbers one. On the
second three thousand six hundred and
twenty-fourth part of the century he num-
bers one pair. On the third day he to-
tals four of a kind. Finally, if we wait 50
(±.001) days he has become a full
house. If a full house is the minimum for
a worthwhile bid, how long will it take
two of the potential beastlings to get
the game on the roa? (Is that sufficiently
vague?)
Here is where we let the shoe pinch
the other foot. Pull the following stunt
on one of your mathematically inclined
friends. Ask him to think of a number.
Multiply it by 5; add 7 to the product;
multiply the sum by 4; add 2 and the
product; multiply this sum by 5. Have
him tell you the final product (it will be
3 digits or more). Now knock off the last
two digits and subtract 1. This was his
original number.
Here, at last, are the correct mis-
takes.

ments Library now occupies the site on
which this building stood. The central
or tower unit connecting the two wings,
contained tall columns for calibrating
pressure gages. In 1900, a twenty-foot
extension was added to the south end
of the east wing of the laboratory.
Professor Cooley personally did most
of the teaching until 1895 when there
began a steady growth in the department.
After the death of Dean Charles E.
Greene in 1904, Professor Cooley was
in dynamics and design. When the Engi-
neering Shops subsequently became a
separate unit, he became Professor oi
Mechanical Practice in 1897. Two year)
later he resigned to study dentistry.
The south wing and center section ol
the present West Engineering Building
were constructed in 1904. This building
contains the principal Mechanical Engi-
neering Laboratories which were moved
from the old building. Upon removal of
the equipment, the forge-shop was en-

Without a doubt, Prof. Keeler is the most qualified man on
the staff to write this article. He received his bachelor's degree in
both EE and ME in 1912.
In 1913 he received his master's degree, and October of the
same year saw his appointment to the Mechanical Eng. staff.
Professor Keeler belongs to a host of engineering societies and
has had industrial experience in many different companies
throughout his career, including consulting work for the Ford
Motor Company.
This structure comprised the north part
of the east wing of the former West
Engineering Annex, which was recently
torn down to provide the site on which
the new Undergraduate Library now
stands. It was a brick building with an
interior of slow-burning mill construc-
tion, and the three stories and attic orig-
inally measured forty by eighty feet. The
Mechanical Engineering Laboratory oc-
cupied the ground floor; the machine
shop occupied the second floor, and the
pattern and wood shops occupied the third
floor. The attic was used for the storage
of patterns and wood.
Mechanical Engineering became in-
creasingly important, and in 1891 the
former Dental Building was acquired to
provide additional classrooms. The Cle-
appointed Dean of the College of Engi-
neering, which position he occupied until
his retirement in June, 1928, at the age
of seventy-three.
Dean Cooley was a very outstanding
man. He had a fine personality and a
brilliant mind, with a fine sense of humor
that got him over many a rough spot in
life. He was a great leader of men and
a truly great educator.
The first courses in shop practice which
were developed by Cooley were taken
over in 1885-86 and further developed
by Professor Clarence George Taylor
(Worcester Polytechnic Institute '81,
M.E. ibid '81, Michigan "02D) as Su-
perintendent. He originated the courses
in naval architecture and mechanical engi-
neering laboratory and introduced work
Iarged on the ground floor of the east
wing of the Engineering Shops. Also, the
foundry was expanded to occupy the
space relinquished by the forge-shop.
From this time on to the present, new
equipment has been added to the De-
partment of Mechanical Engineering.
John Robins Allen ('92e (M.E.). MI.

instructor in 1897 and became head of
the department of Mechanical Engineer-
ing in 1904 and Professor of Mechanical
Engineering in 1907. He resigned in
1917 to become Dean of Engineering at
the University of Minnesota. In 1898, he
initiated a course in heat engines covering

with opportunity, a job that offers a challenge. Union Carbide offers such jobs.
Jobs with opportunity for what? Advancement, for one thing. Union Carbide
is introducing new products at the rate of one every fifteen days. Each new
product opens up new avenues of advancement. Not only that; markets for
our present products are expanding at an exciting rate too.
Jobs with what kind of challenge? Union Carbide has always operated on the
frontiers of science. The challenges are the challenges of that frontier—the
challenges of new ideas. Union Carbide is already among the largest U. S.
producers of titanium—will tantalum be the next "wonder metal"? Union
Carbide pioneered the two major plastics, vinyl and polyethylene—is another
major break-through in the making? Challenging questions, and Union Carbide
people are answering them.

C.E. ibid. '71, M.S. ibid. '74) taught
mechanism and valve gears which, with
various changes in name and content, con-
tinued to be a part of the curriculum for
many years. Heat Engines, as a separate
course, was offered for the first time in
1913-1914.
In 1911-12, Professor Allen was on a
leave of absence from the University for
the purpose of establishing a school of
engineering at Roberts College at Con-
stantinople, now Istanbul, Turkey. He
was eminently successful in this venture
as shown by the steady growth and con-
tinually increasing importance of this
educational institution. He was the au-
thor of "Notes on Heating and Ventila-
tion." This book was one of the first
American books on these subjects and
was widely used. Professor Allen, along
with Professor Joseph A. Bursley as co-
author, brought out "Heat Engines."
Henry Clay Anderson (Kentucky '97E
M.E.) came to the University of Michi-
gan as Instructor of Mechanical Engi-
neering in 1899. He was successively
promoted and became Professor of Me-
chanical Engineering in 1912 and then
succeeded Professor John R. Allen as
head of the Mechanical Engineering De-
partment in 1917. He held this position
until 1937 when he was made Dean of the
College of Engineering upon the resig-
nation of Dean H. C. Sadler. Professor
Anderson was a great teacher and had
the unusual ability to make the subject of
thermodynamics intensely interesting.
John Edward Emswiler (Ohio State
'03E M.E.) succeeded Professor H. C.
Anderson as chairman of the Department
of Mechanical Engineering in 1937 and
occupied this position until his death in
1940. He came to the University of
Michigan as an Instructor in Mechanical
Engineering in 1906 and was appointed
Professor of Mechanical Engineers in
1918. He was greatly interested in re-
search in many fields and developed out-
standing courses in steam turbine theory
and design. He wrote an important and
very excellent book on thermodynamics
which had several editions and was
widely used in universities and technical
schools as a textbook.
Ransom Smith Hawley ('07 (E.E.),
M.E. '15) was appointed acting chairman
of the Department of Mechanical Engi-
neering in 1930, and, after the death of
Professor Enswiler was appointed to the
chairmanship. He came to the Univer-
sity of Michigan in 1917 from the Col-
orado School of Mines. He became Pro-
fessor of Mechanical Engineering in 1920
and retired in 1950. The period of his
chairmanship included World War II and
for six years of the readjustment period
following the close of the war. This was
a time of intense activity and many diffi-
cult problems.
In 1950, Professor Edward Thomas
Vincent (London '21) succeeded Profes-
sor Hawley as chairman. Professor Vin-
cent came to the University of Michigan
as Professor of Mechanical Engineering in
1936 from the Continental Motors Cor-
poration in Detroit where he had been
chief engineer. In 1915 he resigned the
chairmanship to devote his entire time to
teaching and to extensive research and
development work. This interval was one
of great growth and development. Prior
to 1950, the courses in industrial engi-
neering had been taught as a part of the
mechanical engineering curriculum.
In 1950, the curriculum in industrial
engineering (mechanical) was accredited
by the Engineering Council for Pro-
fessional Development, and it was sug-
gested that more courses should be of-
fered in industrial engineering. In 1952,
the Board of Regents approved a curricu-
lum leading to the bachelor degree in
industrial engineering, and in 1952, ap-
proved a change in the name of the
Mechanical Engineering Department to
the Department of Mechanical and In-
dustrial Engineering.
In 1955, Wyeth Allen (Mich. '15E,
Hon. D. Eng. '53) was appointed Pro-
fessor of Industrial Engineering and chair-
man of the Departments of Mechanical
and Industrial Engineering. Professor
Allen had extensive industrial experience
and for many years was a professional
consultant in the fields of engineering,
management, and labor relations, etc.
Prior to coming to the University, he was
President of Globe-Union, Inc. It is in-
teresting to note that Professor Wyeth
Allen is a nephew of the Professor John
R. Allen who was a former head of the
department of Mechanical Engineering.
During 1956, several far-reaching or-
ganizational changes occurred. The orig-
inal shop courses which were given in the
Mechanical Engineering department and
then in the department of Engineering
Shops (which later became the depart-
ment of Metal Processing and ultimately
the Department of Production Engineer-
ing) were incorporated in the offering of
the Department of Mechanical Engineer-
ing. This same year a separate depart-
ment of Industrial Engineering wis es-
tablished, and the department of Me-
chanical and Industrial Engineering
again became the department of Mechan-
ical Engineering, consolidating with the
department of Production Engineering. In
1956, too, the Automotive Laboratory on
the North Campus was finished and all
equipment moved from the old Engi-
neering Annex (Shops) to this fine new
building. Much new equipment was pro-
vided by the Industry Committee so that
now this is the finest unit of its kind in
the world.
There has never been a time in the
history of the Mechanical Engineering
department when there have been so
many and such extensive activities as at
present. These include such important
things as continued reappraisals of the
contents of various courses; improvement
in teaching; methods; introduction of
new courses; continual striving for the
better use of existing educational facili-
ties and the acquisition of new ones.
Intense studies are being made to antici-
pate and provide for necessary personnel
and physical plant that will be required in
the future.
The Automotive building and the
Fluids Laboratory, which is under con-
struction on the North Campus, are indi-
cative of the rapid progress being made.
The new Dearborn Center of the Uni-
versity of Michigan is another activity
which will be a real milestone in the his-
tory of the Department of Mechanical
Engineering.

the American Indian and the Eskimos
have often been considered too backward
to understand and apply advanced prin-
ciples of structural design. But what
early man lacked in education he more
than compensated for by observation and
ingenuity. The design and construction
of an Eskimo home, or igloo, is a case
in point.
Most certainly one of the major prob-
lems confronting the Eskimo is that of
bulding materials. There are basically
three materials that the Eskimo can use
in the construction of an igloo, snow,
ice, and animal skins. At first it may
seem surprising that the Eskimo uses
snow since it is the weakest of the three
materials. A more solid and larger igloo
could certainly be built of ice. But if
ice is used, the igloo would become
essentially a refrigerator that would be
difficult to heat. Snow on the other hand
transmits very little cold to the interior
since it is largely composed of air that
has a low attraction for heat compared
to ice. The advantages of snow as an
insulating material is pointed up by the
fact that temperatures in the igloo often
go up to 90 degrees even though the
heat source is only a small oil lamp.
Animal skins on the other hand would
not affect the interior temperature but
the skins are a poor insulating material
compared to wind-packed snow; thus,
a tent is a difficult structure to anchor
in a wind storm.
An analysis of the effect of wind
impinging on the structure's surface
brings to light some of the interesting
and deep respect for the Eskimos' ability
to apply the empirical method of design.
Since it is not uncommon to have winds
in excess of 100 MPH in polar regions,
it is essential that a structure built of
snow offer a minimum amount of re-
sistance to the wind. The hemispherical
shape of an igloo is an ideal solution
to this problem. As an example of the
superiority of this shape over other
shapes, tests have shown that a sphere
offers only one half as much resistance
to the wind as the diameter plane of
the sphere. But probably the most unique
feature of domical design is its utilization
of the wind's lifting force. Wind tunnel
tests have shown that only a small por-
tion of a hemisphere, subjected to high
wind velocities, has to resist impinging
wind forces because the remaining sur-
face of the structure is under negative
wind loading (See fig 1). The nature
of this negative loading is to lift the
blocks of snow rather than push down
on them.
Another restriction that led to the
development of a domical design was the
poor tensile strength of snow. As sho»r.
in fig. 2, only the bottom third of the
dome is in tension since the blocks above
this point are acting as large wedgK
But below this line there is a tendency
for the wall to buckle out due to the
weight of the wall and roof above. This
puts the outside surface of the wall in
tension. This tension does not create a
problem because snow is banked up
along the base of the igloo to hold these
blocks in place.
Although the Eskimo lacked the fomul
training and the facilities of many of
his contemporaries, he neverthele-^
designed a home that is structurally
sound. It is interesting to note that after
extensive investigation by the Army on
the different types of Arctic survival
shelters, the Eskimo igloo was found to
be the most practicable and dependable

The industrial engineer is primarily interested in
the structure of business problems as an adviser to
major management. His main task is to establish
an uninterrupted flow of production at the lowest
cost possible. He may be called upon to prepare
complete plans for management control systems. Or,
through a study of cost, quality, and quantity ele-
ments, he may be asked to evaluate existing sys-
tems with respect to certain standards. It will be
his job to decide when corrective action should
be taken as his study reveals ways in which pro-
duction is varying from the established standards.
The extent to which such corrective action should
be taken is determined by an analysis of the
human, the economic, and the mechanical elements
of the management control plan. The industrial
engineer may be called upon to prepare several
alternate plans as resources used in the business
vary in their availability.
There are many operating elements in the plan-
ning and control functions of management. The in-
dustrial engineer may be asked to work out meth-
ods which will insure the desired quality of the
product; to evaluate wage rates and production
standards; to establish economical methods lor the
layout of processes and the handling of materials;
to determine inventory policies; to develop ade-
quate production control plans for loading the plant
effectively; to devise adequate means of communi-
cation between management and the working
force. These are examples of the elements with
which the industrial engineer must be concerned
in overall systems design. Preparation for a career
as an industrial engineer requires familiarity with
the basic sciences, with technical engineering, with
business administration, and with the techniques of
industrial engineering.
Because industrial engineering is primarily con-
cerned with setting standards of performance, both
for people and machines, the engineer in this field
must learn to work willingly and helpfully with
other people. Opportunities for employment are
very widespread in industry, but the young gradu-
ate of the program in industrial engineering will
usually start as a member of an engineering team,
and he will need the ability to work harmoniously
in a group.

"Probably the greatest quality of the
poetry of John Milton, who was born in
1608, is the combination of beaty and
power. Few have excelled him in the use
of the English language, or for that mat-
ter, in lucidity of verse form 'Paradise
Lost' being said to be the greatest single
poem ever written."
"When Lafayette first came to this
country, he discovered America, and
Americans needed his help if their cause
was to survive, and this he promptly sup-
plied them."
"Current historians have come to doubt
the complete advantageousness of some of
Roosevelt's policies."
". . . it is possible that we do not
understand the Russian viewpoint . . ."
"Pages 7 through 15 are not required,
but will prove of inestimable worth to
the students in preparation for the term
examination."
"Socrates was Stoic, but it must be
pointed out that Stoicism is very different
from cynicism. A cynic is contemptuous
of all things, especially human nature,
whereas a Stoic is one who accepts all

The corporal hurried into the colonel s

"Colonel," he said, "I have a letter
from the men at Fort Wooster in the
Sahara. They say they are out of water
and that we must aid them."
"Certainly, certainly," replied the col-
onel. "Something will be done within
the week."
"No, sir. We must get water to them
at once."
"Very well, Corporal, there is a cara-
van passing that way tomorrow. We'll
have them supply the water."
"Sir, we must send the water sooner.
Really, Corporal, they can't be that
bad off. Surely they can wait till tomor-
row for water."
"I thought so, too, sir. Then I noticed
that the stamp on the letter was attached

important,
are you going to
get somewhere?
Perhaps you have heard some classmate say, almost complacently,
"Times have changed."
With many branches of industry today openly competing for good
science and engineering graduates, who can blame the young graduate-to-be
for feeling supremely confident. You know you can get a job,
know that salaries are high and are fully aware that
men with technical backgrounds are moving up to administrative
positions in ever-increasing numbers.
Nevertheless, in many respects, times have not changed at all.
That "first job" is every bit as important today as it was five, ten, twenty
years ago. Starting salaries remain only one of many factors to be
considered. And a man's future is still necessarily linked to the future
of the company for which he works. Moreover, a thoughtful examination
of such matters as potential growth, challenge, advancement policy,
facilities, degree of self-direction, permanence, benefits and the like often
indicates that real opportunity still does not grow on trees.

tion, the possibility of infringement of
existing unexpired patents must also be
investigated. Such searches and investiga-
tions are exceedingly interesting to the
engineer, especially if conducted in a field
in which he has had no previous con-
tact. They also provide a great oppor-
tunity to acquire a background in many
arts.
As an engineer in the practice of pat-
ent law you will have the opportunity to
assist in the modification and redesign of
devices to improve performance and con-
struction and to avoid patent infringe-
ment. You are also called upon to find
new products and to assist in their ac-
quisition.
As time goes on the patent applications
which you file will mature into patents,
and your clients will have licensing op-
portunities, thus bringing to you oppor-
tunities of contract negotiation. Still later,
patents in which your clients are interest-
ed will be infringed, and training both
as a lawyer and as an engineer will
qualify you to appear in Federal Court.
The practice of patent law is rela-
tively free from the many unpleasant
phases of general law practice. Optimism
and constructive purpose prevails in most
matters coming to your attention. The
conscientious patent lawyer finds that
he must spend a great deal of time
dampening the enthusiasm of his in-
ventor clients and preparing them for
the shock that their brain child is actu-
ally ninety years old and was born else-
where.
For those of you seeking a profession
of lifelong security, it may be of interest
to note that minor business recessions
stimulate the amount of patent law busi-
ness. Nearly every patent lawyer has more
business than he is able to handle, and if
you retire at sixty-five it is by personal
choice. Active patent lawyers over seventy
are the rule, not the exception.

tailed discussion of the function of the

The answers supplied by this instrument can help you in
your daily life, and also aid industry produce better and less
expensive products in the years to come.
The unique testing instrument is called a Climate-Lab, and
is made by the American Instrument Company, Inc., of Silver
Spring, Md. This instrument can duplicate and accurately sus-
tain almost any global climatic condition.
Electronic, automotive and aeronautical equipment is tested
for its workability under severe weathering conditions.
The Climate-Lab has a 9.6 cubic foot capacity test chamber
which is highly insulated. The entire test chamber is made of
Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corporation's type 304 stainless steel.
This material—about 200-pounds of stainless steel goes into
each unit—was chosen because of its non-corroion properties
and its ease of maintenance.
The Climate-Lab conditions the air before it enters the
test chamber. Controls on the testing equipment are accurate
within plus or minus one per cent relative humidity, and plus
or minus one degree Fahrenheit in temperature. A constant
control system which records time, temperature and humidity
is included.
The Climate-Lab can recreate any climatic condition up to
99 per cent relative humidity, and up to 160 degrees Fahren-
heit.

How to get higher
spindle accuracy,
cut costs too
The engineers who designed
this new surface grinder had to
be sure of the highest spindle
accuracy in order to get the
smooth spindle operation re-
quired for extreme precision
work. To hold the work and
wheel spindles rigid, maintain
highest accuracy, the engineers
specified Timken® "00" tapered
roller bearings. Timken "00"
bearings make possible the
closest machining tolerances
ever achieved. Run-out is held
to 75 millionths of an inch.
And they gave the manufac-
turer greater capacity in less
space, cut manufacturing costs
J4 over earlier spindles used.
How Timken bearings hold shafts rigid to maintain
accuracy—The full line contact between Timken bear-
ing rollers and races gives shafts rigid support over a
wide area. Shaft deflection is minimized. And the tapered
design of Timken bearings permits them to be set up
with the most desirable amount of end play or preload
that gives the best performance.
Want to learn more about job

'TWAS the night before finals and all of the ME's
Were down at the "P-Bell" busy as bees.
When out in the street there arose such a clatter
We found it disturbed our intellectual chatter.
With a flourish of slide rules and delirious yells,
We estimated its magnitude at ten decibels.
With a Hey! and a Ho! we displaced toward the door;
Barely aware of the stress in the floor.
It was snowing outside and had gotten quite frisky—
We dreamed of a glass of BTU'S (whiskey);
There in the moonlight stood, what do you think?
The whole staff of U-M, I shudder to think!
They stood in two rows, all bridles and reins.
Their heads looked too large for their miniature brains.
The whole ugly lot was hitched to a sleigh,
The dean had long ears; we could hear him bray.
Up in the seat sat a strange-looking elf,
He smoked a cigar and seemed pleased with himself.
He looked at us all, then chuckled, then laughed.
In a twinkling we knew we were getting the shaft.
We knew on the morrow we'd be beat to submission,
So we started throwing bottles at that wild apparition.
The old elf sat up and screamed for his life,
"On Brier, on Taylor, on Westrum and Moore,
On Allen, on Emmons, on Mason and Britton."
"Tomorrow," he shouted, "We'll get them back."
Upward they rose; disappeared in the gloom
We displaced back again into the room.
We thought of the elf; it seemed every year
They make finals tougher. We shouted, "More beer!"

After completing the Westinghouse Student Training
Course in 1951, Harvey Graves attended the West-
inghouse Advanced Design Course* and was sent by
Westinghouse to the Oak Ridge School of Reactor
Technology for one year. Back at Westinghouse again
in 1953, Engineer Graves did advanced work on nuclear
reactor development.
In 1955, he was promoted to supervisory engineer
on the Belgian reactor project. In 1956, he was again
promoted to Manager, Westinghouse Nuclear Design
Section. Today, Mr. Graves' 24-man section is develop-
ing and designing the nuclear portion of commercial
reactors for the Yankee Atomic Electric Company and
the Center d'Etude de l'Energie Nucleaire in Belgium.
'Fully accredited graduate school
Progress? Certainly. And if you have ability and
ambition, you'll find Westinghouse offers equal engi-
neering opportunities in automation, jet age metals,
radar, semiconductors, electronics, large power equip-
ment, guided missile controls and dozens of other
fascinating fields.

Why Be Active?
Most engineers have heard the phrase about the
engineer's lack of knowledge concerning humanitar-
ian subjects. An answer to it, and a warning sugges-
tion to engineering students, lies in the realm of
campus activities. It is true that much has been said
and written, extolling the numerous benefits of activi-
ties, but even brief consideration of a few facts will
reveal some possibly startling conclusions—startling,
because many students have overlooked them for their
simplicity and have failed to see the implications of
the situation.
The purpose in studying the humanities should
be an observation of man himself, and when 170
million of them surround each of us, it seems remark-
able that a student will ply the text, eager to learn
about man, and yet will forget his roommate and
classmates. A fantastic wealth of knowledge is found
when a rich association with others develops. Activi-
ties present perhaps the best opportunity to supple-
ment one's textbook education with down-to-earth
experience necessary for a successful life.
This idea is directed especially to those making an
intense study of science and mathematics, for their
education has the greatest lack in textbook learning of
the humanities. A point worth mention would be the
question of which actually supplements which—text-
book study or human experience. But nevertheless,
the important fact to keep in mind is that very few
of us are broad enough in our relations with others to
say justly that we need no experience, and those who
make not even a textbook study of their fellow man
should especially try to gain an interest in others while
in college. In extra-curricular participation on the
campus, the student develops the qualities desirable in
the successful citizen—tolerance for others, leader-
ship, and integrity, to mention a few.
The present-day need for engineers is widely
known. The statements and opinions revealed by in-
dustry show that the man needed possesses a sound
knowledge of science and mathematics, the founda-
tions of today's technological progress. Equally nec-
essary, however, is his ability to understand and handle
people. Most presently graduating engineers will hold
positions of leadership and authority within five to
ten years, and in order to justify these positions and
to open the way for further advancement, the engi-
neer must understand fully those with whom he works.
Experience has shown that industry, in seeking
men with sound human understanding, has aimed at
college graduates with active careers on campus. For
while at college, a student enjoying extra-curricular
activities has broadened his education considerably,
and industry knows this. A key point is: those students
who participate in activities are initially those who
possess an interest in others—that is why they are
active in campus affairs. It is important for those now
in college to evaluate themselves; are they sincerely
interested in others? Do they have a sound understand-
ing of people? These traits are basically necessary;
the student who continually only eats, sleeps, and
studies while in college should slow down and try
to decide if he is short-cutting his education.
Now, with the rapid advent of missile develop-
ment and its associated factors, our nation needs even
more men trained in leadership as well as mathematics,
physics, chemistry, and mechanics. For the good of
himself, others about him, and the nation, todays
engineering and science student should avail himself
of the opportunities to supplement his textbook edu-
cation with human experience among his classmates.

SILENT SOUND
Cut steel with a kitchen knife—it's possible with
ultrasonic waves.
Rapidly developing, the North
Campus at the University will be
the seat of the Engineering Col-
lege, and others, by 1970. (See
P. 20.)
Ever cut through a block of steel with
a kitchen knife or bore through a
window pane with a fountain pen? Prob-
ably not, but it's easy to do with the new
miracle of silent sound—ultrasonic sound
waves.
Ultrasonic sound—one of the world's
newest and most promising tools—has
been put to much better use than the
two demonstration tricks just mentioned.
In the past several years ultrasonic sound
has been put to various uses in many dif-
ferent fields, including machining, engrav-
ing, welding, dentistry, viscosimetry,
cleaning, atomic energy, forestry, and
medical therapy.
Four Main Groups
Basically the methods of use in all of
these fields can be narrowed down to four
main groups—ultrasonic cleaning, nonde-
structive testing, drilling, and medicine.
After a brief discussion of how these
high frequency waves are created we
will examine the four main groups—how
they operate and the jobs they perform.
The ultrasonic waves are created by
using an electronic instrument, similar to
a radio transmitter, to expand and con-
tract a material and thus convert the elec-
trical energy into ultrasonic oscillations
and pulsations. In a rapidly alternating
electrical field, materials such as magnetic
metals, certain crystals, and ceramics ex-
pand and contract at frequencies from
20,000 to five hundred million times per
second. This should be compared to about
18,000 cps, which is the highest audible
to the human ear. Now that we have a
source of ultrasonic waves, the problem is
simply one of applying a suitable sound-
head to the material to be worked on.
Ultrasonic Cleaning
The first main use of ultrasonic waves
mentioned was the so called ultrasonic
cleaning—probably the fastest growing
use of this new tool. Detrex Chemical In-
dustries, Inc., makers of ultrasonic equip-
ment, report that such jobs as the clean-
ing of the insides of hypodermic needles
or delicate camera lenses can be done ten
times faster and much better using silent
sound instead of the tedious, more ex-
pensive hand operations.
The parts to be cleaned are immersed
in a liquid solvent and then sound waves
usually in the 300,000 to 1,000,000
cps range—are directed through the
liquid. These "silent sound" waves will
then shake loose all dirt, oil, and grease
particles from even the finest openings.
Recently a unit was delivered to the
Atomic Energy Commission to be used
to decontaminate radioactive parts. The
job will now take one minute instead of
fifteen as in the past. Another unit now
in use by a midwestern camera manufac-
turer cleans 1000 lenses an hour, replac-
ing 24 girls. Similarly, a Tulsa hospital

ports ultrasonic transducer heads capable of following complicated contours.
has installed equipment for sterilizing
surgical instruments and an Arizona
guided-missile plant has a unit for scour-
ing precision instruments.
The next advance in "ultrasonic clean-
ing" may very well be a soapless dish-
washer. All dishes, pots and pans in-
cluded, could be placed directly in the
washer without even scraping hard gravy
or dried egg yolk off. Within a few min-
utes they'd come out cleaner than ever
before. Of course several problems, the
main one being cost, must be solved be-
fore such a washer is commercially feas-
ible.
Detects Flaws
The second main use of ultrasonic
waves—and the one most widely used in
industry—is nondestructive testing. The
basis for this use is the ability of ultra-
sonic waves to penetrate even the thickest
metals or traverse the length of a steel
beam; and yet they can be stopped by a
tiny air pocket. When "silent sound" is
beamed into an object the waves travel
through the material until they reach a
crack or air pocket. Since it won't cross
the air barrier part of the sound is re-
flected back. By recording the time re-
quired for the round trip engineers can
not only discover there is a flaw but can
also tell you its exact location. Besides
flaws ultrasonic waves can also detect
rather subtle material properties, such as
surface hardness and metal fatigue.
An example of the use of non-destruc-
tive testing is a metals fabricating com-
pany that recently started checking its ex-
trusion presses with "silent sound." So
far they have been able to remove 19 de-
fective parts before they caused the whole
machine to break down.
Silent sound testing has even proved
more valuable than X-rays because ultra-
sonic waves penetrate many solids and
liquids with much greater ease than X-
rays do. For this reason the Watertown
Arsenal in Massachusetts will soon re-
place X-ray equipment with an ultrasonic
sound unit for the mass inspection of
ordnance material.
The Merlewood Research Station in
England has developed a method for de-
tecting flaws in both standing trees and
cut timber. This method will allow the
forester to spot invisible fungus diseases
that slowly destroy good timber. If these
diseases are noticed early enough on a
plantation, a change in the future man-
agement of the trees can be made. An-
other use will be the checking of im-
ported and stored timbers to reduce the
loss due to decay.
Drilling Uses
A third major use of silent sound—
and one of the most amazing—is ultra-
sonic drilling. With an ultrasonic drill it
is a simple matter to cut through such ma-
terials as tungsten carbide, glass, and
even diamonds. Even more amazing is
the fact that the cutting tool can be made
of a softer material than the object being
cut.
Here's how it works: the material to be
drilled or machined is put in place and
the tool is lowered until it is in contact
with the surface. The ultrasonic unit is
turned on causing the tool to vibrate any-
where from 20,000 cps on up. At the
same time a jet of liquid abrasive ma-
terial spurts onto the tip of the drill.
The vibrations of the drill drive the tiny
abrasive particles against the surface to be
cut with a tremendous force, chipping
and grinding an exact duplicate of the
tool face into the work.
Its now possible to see how the two
examples mentioned in the first para-
graph can actually be performed. All
that is necessary is to fasten a kitchen
knife or a fountain pen to the business
end of a ultrasonic wave unit and go to
work. Of course, ultrasonic drilling finds
much more practicable uses. For instance

University in 1955.
the die used for making starter switches
for flourescent lighting fixtures can now
be made for $54 versus $265 using the
old method.
Another use of ultrasonic drilling is in
the manufacturing of transitors. Several
companies are now cutting tiny wafers
from germanium metal 60 times faster
than they could before and doing it much
cheaper. Another important use is the cut-
ting of irregular or odd shaped holes in a
material. All that is needed is a duplicate
of the hole to be drilled and you're in
business.
Medical Purposes
Probably the greatest good done by
ultrasonics—and the last main use we
mentioned—is in the medical and dental
field. Similar to the industrial drill just
discussed is the ultrasonic dental drill.
This drill is gaining popularity rapidly
because of its almost painless operation
due to lack of pressure and heat.
Ultrasonic pulse techniques. (A, B) pulse
transmission from transmitter crystal T
to receiver crystal R; (C) pulse reflec-
tion method with separate crystals T and
R; the extra pip on the oscilloscope in-
dicates a flaw; (D) pulse reflection
method with a single crystal for T and
R; (E) immersion technique; the oscillo-
scope pattern shows multiple reflections
between sample boundaries.
In the medical field "silent sound" is
finding more and more uses every day.
Already it is being used to some extent
in detecting cancer and tumors in much
the same manner it is used for non-
destructive testing in industry. Since dif-
ferent types of tissues within the body
give off different echoes the internal struc-
ture of a person can be sonographed
with sound (just as we get photographed
with light). The image is recorded on a
cathode ray oscilloscope. Using this
method researchers have been able to de-
tect brain tumors, gall stones, and breast
tumors.
Ultrasonic sound acts similarly to light
in many ways. For instance we know that
ordinary light won't hurt us, but that
sunlight can be focused sharply enough
to start a fire. Similarly ultrasonic waves
that have not been concentrated on a
small area have been used quite exten-
sively for deep-heat therapy on people
suffering from arthritis, bursitis, fibrositis,
forms of chronic superficial ulcers, and
many others. On the other hand, waves
that were focused to a sharp point were
recently used for bloodless brain sur-
gery. In late November at Iowa City's
University Hospital nerve bundles in
two tiny parts of the brain were destroyed
to cure Parkinsonism disease. Conven-
tial surgery would have been too crude
and damaging but ultrasonic waves proved
sharper and more precise than any scal-
pel could ever be.
These four areas—ultrasonic cleaning,
nondestructive testing, drilling, and
medicine—and the few practical uses
mentioned just scratch the surface of the
possibilities of this new tool. Already
there is talk about using ultrasonic sound
in such varied fields as welding, dry-
cleaning, and even measuring the amount
of fat on beef cattle. No matter how
you look at it, the future looks bright for
the marvelous miracle of "silent sound."

METEOROLOGY
So you think meteorology is nothing but weath-
er forecasting? Far from it; here two members
of the meteorology group in civil engineering
show why, and trace the development of the
academic and research program at Michigan.

'I 'he popular conception of the meteor-
X ologist is that of the man who tries to
forecast the weather for tomorrow's pic-
nic, the ball game, or to predict whether
elaborate plans for an outdoor graduation
exercise will be rained out. The meteor-
ologist does much more than forecast the
weather. Many are not directly concerned
with weather forecasting; among these are
the meteorologists on the staff of the
University of Michigan. Research meteor-
ologists are engaged in basic studies oi
the complicated processes of the atmo-
sphere in order that this knowledge may
be applied not only to more accurate fore-
casting but to problems arising in fields
such as engineering, architecture, medicine
and public health. They study the physi-
cal phenomena occurring in the atmo-
sphere and analyze weather data mathe-
matically so that a better understanding of
atmospheric processes can be applied to
the many meteorological problems affect-
ing man's varied endeavors.
Meteorology at the University of Mich-
igan emphasizes the applied and inter-
disciplinary aspects of weather knowl-
edge, the definition and solution of
meteorological problems for industry, bus-
iness, communications and other fields as
well as in the education of meteorologists

of theoretical and empirical research.
Meteorology is commonly divided into
four principal divisions: synoptic, dy-
namic, physical, and climatic. All are in-
terrelated and interdependent, however, in
many respects. In the diagram, one or two
examples of the kind of contribution to
be made in applied meteorology is indi-
cated below each of the fields.
Early Programs in Meteorology
Meteorology has had a long history at
Michigan. Early concern in 1849 was ex-
pressed by the Board of Visitors report
to the University Regents when the lat-
ter were upbraided for the lack of "philo-
sophical apparatus." The importance of
meteorology was noted in this same re-
port by the declaration,
". . . Not an instrument, even, for
Meteorological purposes is to be
found in (the Regents') inventory,
notwithstanding the subject is be-
coming every year one of in-
creasing interest to the scholar and
practical man. . ."
Action to remedy this situation was
swift. In the revised State Constitution of
1850, the Regents were directed to pro-
vide facilities to keep "meteorological
tables" at the University. Accordingly, in-
struments were installed at the Astronom-
ical Observatory. Two years later the
Chemistry Department offered the first
course that incorporated meteorology as
part of the syllabus. But the first course in
meteorology as such was not offered until
a generation later, in 1878, by the Astron-
omy Department. The man responsible
for this early emphasis was Prof. Mark
W. Harrington, later to become the first
Chief of the United States Weather Bu-
reau.
Responsibility for the observational and
teaching program has been under three
departments at Michigan. About the turn
of the century the Geology Department
assumed the instructional load from the
Astronomy Department. Meteorology re-
mained in Geology for the next fifty
years. Instruments were installed on the
roof of the Natural Science Building in
1917, but observations for the Weather
Bureau were continued by Astronomy
until 1945.
The first major expansion in the
meteorological program came as a result
of the interest of Prof. Ralph L. Belknap.
During World War II he taught four
courses in this line which were continued
until 1948 when an unfortunate accident
terminated his activities in this field. In
1953, the interest shifted to the Depart-
ment of Civil Engineering, which, under
the chairmanship of Professor Earnest
Boyce and with the support of other staff
members, arranged for the establishment
of a Meteotrological Laboratory in the
department. This action was followed by
the appointment of Dr. E. Wendell Hew-
son as Professor of Meteorology in 1954
and Dr. A. Nelson Dingle as Associate
Professor in 1957, both in the C.E.
Department. A number of lecturers have
also been appointed. The program has
expanded so that at the present time
seventeen courses are offered in meteor-
ology. Responsibility for recording
meteorology observations was also trans-
ferred to the present group in 1956.
Three major pieces of research have
been contributed by early meteorological
investigators at the University. In the late
1920's and early 1930's Prof Belknap
participated in three geological expedi-
tions to Greenland. Meteorological ob-
servations were made on all expeditions
and at that time represented the most
complete data on arctic weather. The sec-
ond contribution was by Professors R. H.
Sherlock and M. D. Stout, who, with a
group of associates, conducted a study on
the effect of wind on electrical conductors
in the mid 1929's. From this work Stout
developed anemometers that became
standards in the field for many years. The
third important work was by Prof. Sher-
lock who, in 1936, initiated wind-tunnel
studies which led to the development of
methods of control of stack gases. He is
now an international authority in this
field.
Present Program
The University is proceeding along the
line of an interdisciplinary program in

A prominent faculty member discusses the plans
of the engineering college to come to the aid
of its country in times challenging as these.
Many factors have combined to draw
attention to the processes and
problems attendant upon the training of
young men and women for careers in
science and engineering. For example,
the critical shortage of qualified tech-
nically trained manpower is well known.
Further, the dangers to the nation and the
free world as a result of the lag in scien-
tific and engineering developments are,
without doubt, very real. Certainly, the
fact that there is insufficient laboratory
and classroom space through which to
offer a continuing education to talented
youth is a major concern. There is addi-
tional information that must be con-
sidered.
For example, there is no reason to
doubt either the estimated quantity or the
quality of the technical trained product
of the present Russian effort in higher
education. The concern that our secondary
school programs of education are failing
to provide adequate science and mathe-
matics courses seems to be justified.
Further, it appears that we are failing to
support and encourage many youths with
aptitudes for science and mathematics. A
large amount of competent, intense study
and writing has been devoted to these
topics. It seems, therefore, that more than
a recognition that these problems exist
would serve no useful purpose so far as
this article is concerned.
How To Regain Our Leadership
The return to leadership in the sci-
ences and technology appears to be one
of the necessary requirements for insur-
ing free man the privileges of liberty, the
right of uninhibited thought and wor-
ship, and the continued extension of a
better standard of living. The efforts of
many groups of people, each understand-
ing their part in the return to leadership,
are required. For example, the elementary
and secondary school programs can best
be altered by the group familiar with
these schools. Support of needed facili-
ties required to implement extended edu-
cational programs are the responsibility of
those bodies charged with the task ot
providing funds. Many more such divi-
sions of responsibility could be enumer-
ated. Certainly, it is the responsibility of
faculties of instruction of higher educa-
tion to assume the task of developing
educational programs and to plan needed
suitable facilities in order that quality

and quantity are compatible and are di-
rected to the future scientific and tech-
nological effort.
It is the purpose of this article, there-
fore, to introduce the plans for educa-
tional programs and facilities as develop-
ed by the Faculty of the College of Engi-
neering at the University of Michigan.
The claim that the epitome of perform-
ance and planning has been reached is not
being put forth; however, the flexibility
that is inherent in both phases of the ap-
proach will make it possible to consider
adjustments far into the future.
Before proceeding to a discussion of
new programs and plans for facilities, it is
imperative that the historical background
of the profession be understood. The
weaknesses and strength of the educa-
tional programs, studied by those men are
largely responsible for the present high
standard of technology, should be known.
It is desirable to understand some of the
reasons for the critical shortage of man-
power in the engineering profession.
Further, it seems proper that an appraisal
be made of the frequently heard criticism
of the deficiency in cultural background of
the engineer.
A History of Engineering
Formal educational programs designed
to satisfy the needs of the engineer came
into being more than one hundred years
ago. The programs were developed by
men with substantial understanding of
mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and
a professional outlook based upon ex-
perience they had acquired in their adult
life. Their background training also in-
cluded a substantial knowledge of the
humanities. The dynamic character of
the early efforts of engineers soon resulted
in diverging areas of specialization among
the group, with the result that the several
degree programs as known in the mid-
twentieth century came into being. Al-
though the several areas of specialization
have developed rapidly, the profession
has been fortunate in that each has re-
quired a common base in the physical
sciences, in mathematics, and in the writ-
ing and speaking of English.
The ability of engineers in the several
fields of specialization to work together as
a team to contribute to the solution of
complex problems is to a large measure
responsible for the technological progress
to date. It seems fair to affirm that a con-
siderable portion of our technical progress
is due to the efforts of men, with vary-
ing certifications of educational back-
ground, working together, each with a
common understanding of fundamentals
and a highly developed understanding of
a certain phase of many complex prob-
lems. Certainly the fact that the various
areas of specialization require a common
base of fundamental information upon
which to build is a tower of strength.
More important is the fact that this com-
mon base has been expanded during com-
paratively recent years.
The weaknesses of the present pro-
grams are more difficult to determine.
The occasional inability to completely
comprehend, analyze, and weigh the vari-
ous portions of the many complex prob-
lems with which the engineer is concerned
such that the end-product or process per-
forms to expectation, has led to investi-
gations of his background preparation.
One finds that it is no longer easy to de-
velop the relatively simple single com-
ponent by intuition and trial and error
procedures. The component relation to the
system must be understood. Such under-
standing in many cases requires that the
engineer use the modern computing ma-
chines available to him. The computing
machine result, however, is only as good
as the engineer's ability to relate the
several phases of his problem.
Present Engineering Trends
There is a growing sentiment favoring
greater emphasis on the basic sciences and
mathematics accompanied by a decrease
in the course work directed toward spec-
ialization. Two specific benefits to the en-
gineer's training can be expected. First,
greater penetration into the sciences
should provide the engineer with an in-
sight into the continuous change in order
of magnitude from the macroscopic to the
microscopic. For instance, the engineer
familiar with the process of heat release
from a pound of fossil fuel must now be
conversant with the energy release phen-
omena due to fissioning of the atom.
Secondly, the fourth dimension, time,
which formerly was a lesser part of many
engineer's thinking has become a neces-
sary consideration. A complete knowledge
of transient rather than just the steady-
state behavior of processes without doubt
is necessary. Seeking out and assimilating
this knowledge requires further penetra-
tion into the physical sciences and mathe-
matics.
The apparent strength of curricula,
which have been the "guide lines" for
preparing the manpower to whom we
have been, and are at this moment, look-
ing for continuity in our technological
progress, lies in the sequence of sub-
ject material and accompanying thought
discipline required in its comprehension.
Qualified teachers of high professional
background have fortunately been avail-
able to encourage students in a rigorous
training. It seems that gradual, well
thought-out alterations to the present cur-
ricula are required rather than any vio-
lent over-throwing of past educational
practices.

Why the Shortage?
The critical shortage of engineering tal-
ent is the result of several factors, all of
which combine to influence the continuing
demand. Certainly, the national effort to
develop armament drains off a portion of
the available technical talent. This require-
ment will likely continue. The shortage of
young engineers is a serious threat to the
new advancing fields of domestic tech-
nological development. Young people
with advanced training in the engineering
sciences accompanied by a strong analyti-
cal ability are being sought in these areas
of development. The third, and by far the
largest demand for engineering talent,
originates in established areas of engineer-
ing endeavor. Continued improvement de-
mands an expanding effort to participate
in the new technological fields. More
young people of exceptional ability who
can analyze deficiencies in design, product,
and performance are required in order
that the component will satisfy the ever-
shortening time intervals that accompany
the trend to high speed.
Culture and the Engineer
The deficiency in cultural development
of the engineer and scientist is of genuine
concern to both those who are associated
with engineering and those who are ob-
serving the performance of the engineer
from without. Because of his technical
ability, the engineer is called upon to
make decisions; that is, to become mem-
bers of management, to participate in
projects and programs benefiting those
who are affected by his decision, and gen-
erally to assume the role of leader, coun-
selor, confidant, and teacher, all of which
require that he practice the teachings of
the humanities and social sciences, of
psychology, and other formalized subjects
that may have not been in his formal
course of study. The engineer and sci-
entist is more keenly aware of the need
for cultural development than those ob-
serving from without.
In this respect, it is particularly signifi-
cant to note that industry has become ac-
tive in sponsoring formal course work
for their technical personnel in sub-
jects usually considered non-technical for
the purpose of developing future mana-
gerial talent. Sociology, psychology, and
the humanities are among these subjects.
Those concerned with engineering cur-
ricula are making effort to formally intro-
duce these subjects into the educational
programs for engineering students. How-
ever, at this writing, it would appear that
this should not be done at the expense of
less concentration on the sciences and
engineering. There are several possibili-
ties whereby the introduction of the "hu-
manities" might be accomplished. The
concentration on the sciences and mathe-
matics might be increased at the second-
ary school level, or a longer time for study
at the college level might be considered.
Certainly, the careful examination of the
engineering curricula for available time
will certainly continue.
Faculty planning must initially be pre-
dicated upon the proposition that those
youths seeking higher education will ac-
cept the challenge to work toward an
understanding and ability to use the sci-
ences. The student, on the other hand
must be permitted to use his maximum
imagination and initiative. An ability to
think logically and the acquisition of a
background of fundamental information
are essential to the outstanding per-
formance of an engineer or scientist in
any field of technological endeavor. All
educational programs, therefore must be
directed toward the student's inherent
creative ability and his aptitude for as-
similating the fundamentals of the pro-
fession.
There are several program procedures
which will accomplish the above purpose.
However, since the past programs have
been responsible for the substantial prog-
ress to date, it would seem that continued
examination of existing programs and in-
telligent evaluation of the changing needs
of a profession would appear to be rea-
sonable criteria upon which to proceed.
The studies attendant to curriculum
changes never cease in an engineering col-
lege. An alert faculty is never satisfied
with its past performance. The faculty of

tinct areas of development.
In the first place, because modern tech-
nology relies to a major degree upon
greater depth and understanding of
mathematics and the physical sciences in
engineering, the Science Engineering Pro-
gram has become a joint effort of the
faculties of all areas of specialization in
the Engineering College. This program
has three distinct aims. First, a way is
being sought to achieve greater under-
standing at the beginning level through
rearrangement of subject material in
mathematics and the physical sciences.
Second, an advanced program in science
and mathematics is being developed for
those students who desire to continue.
And, thirdly, programs in the department
of specialization are being rearranged to
take advantage of the better orientation of
the required basic fundamentals of the
engineering profession. Students whose
past performance is equal to that nor-
mally required for admission to the Engi-
neering College and who present suitable
preparatory work normally required for
regular admission with no deficiencies, are
admitted to the Science Engineering Pro-
gram.
The Physical Plant
A second major step in the develop-
ment of educational programs is the
grouping of subject material into "Areas

rected toward Materials of Construction,
Metallurgy and Rate Processes in Chemi-
cal Engineering; Design, Heat Power,
Fluid Machinery and Air Conditioning
programs in Mechanical Engineering; and
Electronics and Power programs in Elec-
Mortimer E. Cooley Memorial Laboratory.
trical Engineering are typical of the effort.
These programs are intended to draw
upon the abilities of the faculty from the
several professional departments who have
a specialized interest in the area of activ-
ity. It is expected that although each
department will have a slightly different
approach to the area of interest, the com-
bination of the several viewpoints will
strengthen the program in all depart-
ments of the College.
An example will serve to illustrate The
Program in Nuclear Engineering draws
attention from the Physicist, the Electrical
Engineer, the Chemical Engineer, the Me-
chanical Engineer, the Metallurgist, and
the Marine Engineer. While each of these
professional men may have a different
interest in the nuclear process, the com-
bined contribution to a program effort not
only adds strength to the Nuclear Engi-
neering Program, but the separate partici-
pating departments within the Engineer-
ing College have likewise strengthened
their professional positions. Such an edu-
cational program closely resembles the ap-
proach that industry would follow in an
important research and development
project.
Adequate laboratory facilities have
been of equal concern in the development
program of the College of Engineering.

ENGINEERING FAILURES
With almost severe regularity, newspapers and
radio tell of the failures of modern engineering;
the facts behind these breakdowns are varied
and interesting.
The successes of modern engineering
are well known today. Engineering
marvels have transformed our way of life,
and new and wonderful innovations of
the most remarkable sort are calmly ac-
cepted by the public as the inevitable
product of a seemingly perfect techno-
logical system.
Perhaps the wonders of science and
engineering would be regarded with more
wonder if the public were equally well
acquainted with the failures and blunders
that have been committed by men in these
fields. It is unfair to assume that these
scientists are more than men; as such they
are subject to oversights, miscalculations,
and involuntary omissions in their work.
Some of these have been rather comical in
outcome, others have resulted in terrible
tragedies. Invariably they are unpubli-
cized in relation to the amount of promo-
tion and fanfare attendant to successful
completion of engineering projects.
It may be somewhat of a rude shock to
student engineers to learn that the engi-
neer often is entrusted with critical prob-
lems to solve, and that others will rely on
the quality of his work. In order that we
may appreciate the fallibility of engi-
neers, and the dire consequences of their
blunders or oversights, let us consider
some of the more noteworthy of recent
failures.
The British Comets
Crashes of two British de Havilland
jet airliners in early 1954 triggered whit
was possibly the most thorough and costly
series of tests ever undertaken to examine
a failure. Within four months these two
airliners had crashed for no apparent
reason, one in the Mediterranean near
Elba, Italy, and the other at Naples. Each
had accumulated about 3500 hours of
air time.

FEBRUARY, 1958


Conditions near West Tower after failure.
The public inquiry, which started in
London in October, 1954, and lasted for
22 days, involved 68 witnesses and 145
exhibits. The evidence to the court cov-
ered 1600 pages of transcript, and ran
over 800,000 words. In addition, labora-
tory studies conducted by the Royal Air-
craft Establishment at Farnborough, Eng-
land, under the direction of Sir Arnold
Hall, contained 120,000 words and 285
illustrations; it was 4 in. thick and
weighed 101/4 lbs.
The study commenced with operations
to recover from the shallow sea water
near Elba as much of the (first) wrecked
plane's structure as possible. Underwater
television was employed to aid divers.
Roughly one-half of the structure was
eventually recovered; these were returned
to Farnborough, where they were applied
over a wooden model of the aircraft. Pre-
liminary attempts to deduce any possible
reason for failure from the jigsaw puzzle
of torn metal produced no results.
In the light of general evidence, it
seemed possible that some sort of fatigue
failure had occurred; this seemed espec-
ially possible in view of the fact that both
accidents had occurred during the ships'
initial climb, and at about 30,000 feet.
Since under these conditions maximum
stresses would occur in the walls of the
pressure cabin, fatigue failure of the
pressurized cabin was deemed the most
logical field of inquiry.
At Farnborough, a new technique was
employed in testing a sample cabin struc-
ture for possible weaknesses. The cabin
was filled with water, while the entire
fuselage was encased in a waterproof
jacket. Varying the pressure differences
between the cabin and outer tank simu-
lated actual flight conditions. Addition-
ally, hydraulic rams on either wing ap-
plied equivalents of wind gusts.
After approximately 9000 hours of
simulated flight, the test aircraft's cabin
wall developed a crack which rapidly
widened to a long tear. It is presumed
that the test plane, had it continued to
fly, would have been wrecked also, due to
the even more extensive damage which
would have been wrecked also, due to
ity of the air. In addition, a serious crack
in the wing developed after only 5500
hours. This probably would have caused
the destruction of the test plane also, but
this type of failure did not occur in the
Elba crash.
A metallurgical analysis of the alum-
inum sheet containing the failure showed
that a peak stress of 45,700 psi. might be
encountered several times during the
course of a flight. This material (British
D.T.D. 546, equivalent to American 24
S-T 4) has an estimated static strength
of about 65,000 psi.: the peak working
stress was 70% of the ultimate strength.
In addition, rivet holes in the stress field
caused localized increases of considerable
magnitude in regions too small to be
measured with conventional strain guages.
The British Ministry of Transport
later announced the granting of per-
mission for the employment of a rede-
signed version of the Comet aircraft on
a large scale.
Tacoma Narrows
Less tragic and more striking, but just
as costly, was the renowned Tacorm
Narrows Bridge, which, shortly after
completion, fell to twisting violently be-
tween its supports, and eventually fell
into the waters of the Narrows, to the loss
of over S6 million. It seems that winds
traveling the length of the suspension
bridge's decking set up torsional oscilla-
tions in which the decking became a
near-perfect one node sine wave with a
peak-to-peak amplitude often exceeding
six feet. Soon the concrete floor of the
bridge dropped, followed shortly by the
center span.
It is interesting to note that at no time
during the several weeks that the deck
was in constant gyrations did the wind
exceed ten miles per hour except for occa-
sional gusts on certain of the days. This
tendency to oscillate in sympathy to cer-
tain turbulences of the wind was noticed
to some degree during construction, but
was apparently considered not sufficiently
important to warrant any basic changes
in the design of the bridge.
An investigation of the failure of the
Tacoma Narrows bridge was requested by
the Federal Works Agency. The investi-
gating commission found the bridge to be
of basically sound design, and the tor-
sional oscillations due to wind turbu-
lence. The bridge seemed to have had
aerodynamic characteristics which con-
tributed to the amplitude of the oscilla-
tions, but the experience of bridge
builders at the time with wind was limit-
ed to dealing with the static forces of
wind resistance.
The dropping of the decking and the
spans were attributed to the unforseen
stresses caused by the oscillations. Little
apparent harm was done the towers of
the bridge, which remained standing after
the disintegration of the cables and spans.
There was no evidence that the anchor-
ages had moved.
Similar oscillations, of considerably less
magnitude, have been observed in the
Golden Gate bridge under conditions of
severe windstorm.
As an interesting sequel, we might adJ
that the undamaged portions of the
bridge were dismantled and removed to
the crossing of British Columbia's Peace
River by the Alaska Highway, where it
was rebuilt. Only this autumn, the bridge

Remarkable recent developments in metallurgy
and allied fields have been made possible by
the evolution of the new science of the ad-
hesive bonding of metals.
The last twenty years have seen adhe-
sive bonding of metals develop into
a very significant operation. Indeed, many
metal products built today would be im-
practical, if not impossible, without the
aid of adhesive bonding. The success of
the modern aircraft depends in part upon
the weight and space savings and the
better mechanical properties resulting
from adhesive bonding. Sample advant-
ages include a weight saving of 450 lb.
(about 5%) in the central structural box
of a wing which has 1520 sq. ft. in sur-
face area (5),1 better fatigue failure
resistance, and better smoothness with
thinner "skins" (15) when compared
with riveted structures. These are but a
few of the benefits which have been reap-
ed by the aircraft industry's engineers,
who were among the first to utilize ad-
hesives on a large scale and are now
intimately familiar with the potentialities
of the techniques and materials. (7, 12,
14)
But the engineer who is not yet familiar
with adhesive bonding might also be able
to reap advantages from adhesives if he
knew what to consider. Thus, it is the pur-
pose of this article to set forth the basic
fundamentals which underlie the decision
to bond two metals together with an ad-
hesive.
Theore of Adhesive Bonding
The "theoretical aspects" of adhesive
bonding are not highly theoretical. In
fact, in many instances they are only
greatly refined empirical relations to
which hypotheses have been ascribed.
(17) However, this should not be alarm-
ing, for many cohesive bonding phenom-
ena—for example, Van der Waal's forces
—which should be easier to explain, have
not been completely elucidated.
There are two mechanisms which con-
tribute to the sticking of one material to
another: 2 mechanical adhesion and spe-
cific adhesion. Mechanical adhesion is
certainly a minor fraction of the total ad-
hesion, so it will be only briefly discussed
and then dismissed.
Mechanical adhesion is the adhesion
which results from the adhesive's flowing
into nooks and crannies of the metals'
surfaces before curing, so that when it
is cured, it has trapped within its grasp
the various minute projections on the sur-
faces. Mechanical adhesion is therefore
greatly enhanced by a roughened surface/'
However, it is a direct result of this fact
that yields conclusive proof that mechani-
cal adhesion is only a small fraction of
the total adhesion. For if the surfaces of
the metals are ground and polished, so
that the "hills" are deposited in the "val-
leys," very smooth surfaces result, but a
fairly good bond is still possible. (1,
11,19)
Specific adhesion is the adhesion which
results from the attraction of the adhe-
sive's molecules for the molecules of the
metals. That is, the metal pieces are at-
tracted by the adhesive and, hence, to
each other. The forces that cause the at-
traction are not clearly known. However,
it is thought that they are molecular in
nature,4 chiefly Van der Waal's, residual
valency, polar, and hydrogen bonding
forces.
Although the theory of specific adhe-
sion is not at all clear, it has been con-
sidered quantitatively. Specific adhesion is
closely linked with adsorption. Therefore,
it can most readily be described with an
approach similar to, but extending be-
yond, that used to describe adsorption.
Thus, there is a work of adhesion of the
adhesive onto the metal surface (or
vice versa), and also works of cohesion
of the adhesive and of the metal.
The work 5 of adhesion is the amount
of work necessary to separate a unit area
of adhesive-metal interface and thereby
create a unit of adhesive-air interface Mii
a unit of metal-air interface. That is, the
work of adhesion equals the sum of the
surface free energies of the two interfaces
created less the surface free energy of the
interface destroyed:
wA = sa + sra-s„m (#1)
where WA is the work of adhesion, the
S's are surface free energies, and a de-
notes the adhesive-air interface, m de-
1 Numbers in parentheses refer to the en-
tries in the bibliography.
2 Omitted from consideration are joints of the
following types: soldered, welded, brazed, and
those which involve chemical reactions between
the adhesive and the metals.
a It will be shown later that this is not the
primary reason for roughening surfaces to be
joined by an adhesive.
4 Molecular is used in this sense as distin-
guished from covalent, ionic, or metallic forces.
5 The usual thermodynamic convention is fol-
lowed: positive work is work done by the sys-
tem.

notes the metal-adhesive interface. (17,
24)
Similarly, the work of cohesion of a
material is the amount of work necessary
to separate the material from itself and
thereby form two unit areas of material-
air interface. Hence, the work of cohesion
equals twice the surface free energy of
the material-air interface:
Wc = 2Sa, for the adhesive (#2)
W, = 2Sm, for the metal (#3)
where W(, and W(, are the work of cohe-
sion for the adhesive and metal, respec-
tively. However, since the metals are
usually considerably stronger—that is,
they have higher works of cohesion—than
the adhesives, they seldom are sites of
failure, and their works of cohesion are
not further considered. (17, 24)
It is readily seen that if the work of
adhesion is greater than the work of co-
hesion of the adhesive for an adhesive-
metal system, not only will the adhesive
wet 0 the metal completely with no ad-
ditional energy required, but also eventual
failure of the bonded joint will not oc-
cur at the interfaces but within the adhe-
sive. On the other hand, if the work of
cohesion of the adhesive exceeds the
work of adhesion, an addition of energy
will be required to obtain complete wet-
ting, and, even more important, failure
will occur at the interfaces before either
of the ultimate stress limits of the ad-
hesives and the metals is reached. Thus,
it is essential to achieve a work of adhe-
sion which is greater than the work of
cohesion of the adhesive for maximum
ultimate strength of the bond. (17, 24)
In order to increase the ultimate
strength of an adhesive bond it is neces-
sary to increase WA. Examination of
equation # 1 shows that this could be
obtained by decreasing Sam, increasing S„,
or increasing Sm. So far few attempts
have been made to change Sum. Increasing
Sa will certainly increase WA, but not as
fast as it will increase Wf, as given by
equation #2.7 Consequently, the effective
S„, must be increased. (24) Specific sug-
gestions for this are given in the next
section.
It should be noted that all systems at-
tempt to reduce their free energy. It is for
this reason that specific adhesion occurs,
regardless of the mechanism. Likewise,
however, any metal with a high surface
free energy, which has already been
pointed out to be necessary for good ad-
hesive bonding, will attempt to reduce its
surface free energy by adsorbing what-
ever is available—e.g., air, dirt, etc.—
rendering the resulting effective "surface"
one of low surface free energy. Thus, this
adsorbed layer must be removed for ad-
hesion of the adhesive to occur. (4, 11,
17) This, too, will be further discussed in
the next section.
Bonding Techniques
"Bonding techniques" include all the
phases involved in making an adhesive
bond between two metals except the de-
cision to use adhesive bonding and the
selection of the proper adhesive, both of
which are discussed in later sections. It
cannot be overstressed that, while the ma-
terial presented appears to be very gen-
eral and non-specific, it does apply to all
adhesive bonded metal joints except
where otherwise noted.
Preparation of the metal surfaces
should be the first phase to receive the
engineer's consideration, for if satisfac-
tory surfaces cannot be obtained, the
bond will fail at the metal-adhesive inter-
faces under very low stresses. And "prob-
ably no topic . . . has received less at-
tention than the effects ... of the metal
surface on the adhesion produced be-
tween itself and the adhesive. . . ." (2)
Two surface factors, the surface free
energy and the physical condition of the
surface, affect adhesive bonding. First to
be discussed is the surface free energy,
followed by the physical condition of the
surface.
Surface free energy, as previously men-
tioned, is strongly affected by surface con-
taminants. That is, since the actual, clean
metal has a very high surface free energy
—indicated by its behavior in the molten
state—it adsorbs air, dirt, grease, etc.
from the atmosphere to reduce the free
energy of the surface. And the greater
the surface free energy—and, hence,
more desirable for adhesive bonding—the
greater is the likelihood that it will be
contaminated. Thus, the effective metal
surface is the adsorbed layer of low
surface free energy molecules. (11, 17,
24)
Consequently, the surface contaminants
must be removed. Grease and dirt can be
removed by vapor degreasing, alkaline
cleaning, solvent washing, metal etching,
or anodizing, since the contaminants do
not readily adhere to an oxide film. (11,
12) However, air will be adsorbed almost
u To wet is to be attracted to the surface
and to spread out on the surface. There are de-
grees of wetting.
7 This does not rule out the possibility of
increasing Sm, but if it is done, Sm must still
be increased.

being removed from the cleaning bath,
and can be displaced by the adhesive
alone after it is applied. This latter ef-
fect is easily demonstrated by using paraf-
fin wax as an adhesive for brass plates:
If the melted wax is poured when the
brass is at room temperature, it solidifies
before it displaces the air, and the point
fails under the weight of the brass alone.
But if the paraffin is kept liquid by heat-
ing the brass pieces themselves to a tem-
perature above the wax's melting point,
the wax will eventually displace the ad-
sorbed gases, yielding a point so strong
that the wax breaks before the wax-
brass interface breaks. (4, 11, 12)
After the surfaces have been "clean-
ed," they should be checked to determine
if the cleaning has been thorough. Al-
though an electrical resistance check can
be used (3), the surface free energy can
best be evaluated by measuring the wet-
tability of a drop of liquid with the metal
surface. It makes little difference what
liquid is used for testing so long as its
surface free energy is equal to or greater
than the surface free energy of the pro-
posed adhesive; therefore, water, whose
surface free energy is considerably greater
than most adhesives (72 dynes/cm.), is
usually used. Thus, if the water will wet
the metal surfaces, it is fairly certain that
any adhesive will also wet the surface. If,
however, water only partially wets the
metal surface, the following empirical
relation applies
WA--W,. (1 + cos 0) (#4)
where 0 is the angle that the liquid drop
makes with the metal surface. Hence,
since W(, is constant for a given liquid,
changes in 0 reflect changes in Snl and
WA, and whether the metal "surfaces"
need further treatment can be determined.
(11, 17, 19)
It goes without saying that once the
surfaces have been thoroughly cleaned,
they should be handled as little as pos-
sible, and then only with clean gloves. It
is advisable to apply the adhesive imme-
diately after the cleaning treatment.
Another method of changing the sur-
face free energy of the metals is metal-
lurgical manipulation. Selective directional
rolling, for example, with or without sub-
sequent recrystallization, will increase the
surface free energy by reorienting some of
the crystals. A given crystal has various
regions which have different surface free
energies when they are exposed. There-
fore, an orientation of the surface crys-
tals which exposes those regions which
contribute high surface free energy leads
to a higher work of adhesion and higher
bond strength. (2, 11)
The second surface factor which affects
adhesive bonding, the physical condition
of the surfaces, refers to smoothness,
roughness, and similar characteristics.
"Almost smooth" surfaces are desired. As
the film thickness approaches zero, the
stresses within the adhesive film ap-
proach zero; therefore, depressions which
would have to be filled as well as the
gap between the metal pieces are to be
avoided.8 Also, badly scored surfaces tend
to result in airs being trappel and
high stress concentrations in non-ductile
metals. (3, 9, 10, 17, 21) Perfectly
smooth surfaces are not desired, how-
ever, because a slightly roughened surface
has as much as 20 times the surface area
as a perfectly smooth one. The increase
in area greatly increases the specific ad-
hesion, which in turn increases the
strength of the bonded joint. (6)
The second phase of bonding tech-
nique that should receive the engineer's
consideration is the application of the ad-
hesive. Adhesives come in various forms:
emulsions, solutions, coated dried films,
pastes, powders, aand rods. The first two
require means for evaporating the ve-
hicles, but they are applied with the least
effort—by roller brushing, spraying, or
brushing in the ordinary manner, or by
dipping the metal into a bath. None of
the rest are as readily applied, but since
they usually require heat, and sometimes
pressure, for curing, they may be ap-
plied more leisurely, and mistakes made
in placing the pieces may be corrected be-
fore the adhesive is "set." (12, 13, 20)
The amount of adhesive applied is very
critical. Although as thin a film as pos-
sible- is desired, care must be taken to in
sure the adhesive's filling the entire gap
between the two pieces. The presence of
"flash" at the edges of the joint is a
good indication that a completely filled
joint has been made. There is no re-
liable method for determining if a com-
pletely filled joint has been made if there
is no "flash" except destruction of the
entire assembly. It is necessary to remove
the "flash" by mechanical scraping or
sanding after softening it with hot alka-
line solution or with warm formic acid
before the adhesive is cured if appearance
or functioning demand it. Undesired
"flash" may be prevented by covering the
edge of the joint with masking tape.
(7, 12)
The third phase of bonding technique
deserving the engineer's consideration is
the drying of the adhesive prior to curing,
for if the vehicle is not removed at this
time, the adhesive will blister as it tries
to escape during the curing operation
Essentially the problem is one of provi;
ing the proper atmosphere during the dry-
ing period. Evaporation of the vehicle
cools the metal surfaces, and if the air is
moist, the moisture will condense berweer
the metal surfaces and the adhesive at tk
interfaces, obviously causing a poor bond.
Also very important is the removal of the
generally toxic and usually obnoxious
vehicle vapors from the air. (7, 12)
The final phase of bonding technique
is the curing or setting of the adhesne.
A few commonly used adhesives set at
room temperature, but most require hea:
at temperatures in the range of 250°F
to 350°F. If high pressure is also re-
quired, the adhesive is cured in an auto-
clave where pressures as high as 1200
p.s.i. are not uncommon. (20) Extremely
high pressures and temperatures should
not be used if they are not absolutely
necessary, for when the adhesive is cured
in this manner, it reaches an equilibrium
state under abnormal conditions. Then,
when cooled and under normal pressure,
the adhesive tends to achieve a new
equilibrium, but it is restrained at the
bonded surfaces, and residual stress re-
sults which reduces the ultimate applied
stress of the joint. (6, 10, 12)
Adhesive Materials
To this point, the adhesives have not
been identified and have been considered
identical. Now that the requisites of
adhesive bonding have been outlined
from other viewpoints, it is appropriate
to distinguish between different adhesives
as well as to better define the type of
material that is considered for bonding
metals together.
The materials used for adhesive bond-
ing are predominantly organic resins—
thermosetting, thermoplastic, and elasto-
meric. (1, 2, 7, 9, 11, 19, 20) Gener-
ally speaking, a particular resin is select-
ed because it is a particular type of the
above and because it adheres well. That
is, the properties that determine in which
category the resin fits also determine
whether it is suitable for a given applica-
tion. Thus, it is convenient to base the
discussion of the resins on the proper-
ties characteristic of the above categories
as much as possible. In very few in-
stances are pure substances used, for com-
8 Explanations of this effect are many, but
not in agreement. An excellent discussion of
the merits of the various explanations may be
found in Balduf and Meissner, "Strength Be-
havior of Adhesive Bonds," ASME Transac-
tions, July 1951, 73:697-702. (3)

"They all agree..?
"Since the day we decided to get married, I've been
doing a lot of thinking about our future. It's time I
made a choice on a career. I've talked to the Dean of
Engineering, most of my professors, and to some of the
fellows who have graduated, and you know, they all
said the same thing.
"They all agree that the aircraft and missile industry
holds the best opportunities and the brightest future for
an engineer these days. What they said makes sense,
too, because developments in this field today really give
a fellow an opportimity to make important contribu-
tions on vital projects.
"Not only that, but the aircraft industry is noted for
its good salaries. Generous benefits, too. And advance-
ment in both salary and position is limited only by how
far 1 want to go."
Unlimited opportunities, high salaries, company-paid
benefits unheard of until a few years ago — these
are only a few of the reasons why so many young engi-
neers with a keen eye to the future are choosing the
aircraft industry.
It is only natural that many engineering graduates
should consider joining Northrop Aircraft, Inc., be- ^—r- ,
cause the company shares its many successes with every td
member of its engineering and scientific team. Ad-
vanced projects at Northrop are now in production, and
active top-priority projects mean rapid advancement

Such projects include the famous Snark SM-62,
world's first intercontinental guided missile, now being
activated in the first United States Air Force missile
squadron; the USAFT-38 supersonic twin-jet ad-

Compiled by JAMES STEVENS
Everyone who digs through old maga-
zines for a feature such as this one,
every once in a while comes across some-
thing really of value. I think that I have
made just such a find in the February,
1933 issue. I think this twenty-five-year-
old editorial will ring a familiar bell.
The Smoking Room Again
"Once more the halls and corridors of
our dear old Engine School are invaded
with a lively discussion of an old, old
question. We hear the same old argu-
ments that we heard four years ago, four
years before that, and on back ad infini-
tum. We are faced with the same tem-
porary enthusiasms pro the argument and
the same old lack of get behind and push
that has always doomed this particular
discussion to an ineffective conclusion. It
has always seemed peculiar how some
questions will arise, excite an extraordin-
ary amount of comment, seem to have
worlds of backing, but yet die out quietly
for lack of real leadership and decision.
"This is certainly a real opportunity for
settling the problem of the engineers'
smoking room for once and for all. Just
in case you haven't joined in yet, we are
referring to the time honored plan of
making arrangements for turning over
some convenient room in the West Engi-
neering building to those devotees of
the weed who desire to study in the
sacred blue haze. There are several very
pertinent arguments on both sides of the
question which should be collected in an
orderly fashion and presented to the
proper authorities. But before anything
definite is attempted the possibilities of
the plan should be determined in view
of the University fire regulations, made
necessary by the exigencies of insurance
rates, and the need for all the available
classroom space in the college. A decision
could then be reached which will settle
the problem finally and completely. Most
of the major organizations of the Engi-
neering School are back of the plan. It re-
mains only for the proper one to come
out and assume the leadership which has
so long remained dormant in its decayed
bones. If not it is to be sincerely hoped
that one of the two really active groups
in the college can find time to add an-
other alien function to the lists of its
other worthwhile accomplishments.
"If the smoking room can be arranged
conveniently, the plan certainly should
be worked out."
As long as I started with an editorial
why change horses in midstream? The
two following editorials came from that
same volume of twenty-five years ago.
The Heritage of the Engineer
"Which is the more important, the fos-
tering of the mind and the development
of intellect, or the utilization of matter
and the bending of natural forces to the
will of mankind? In either case engineer-
ing is lighting the path and will continue
to light the way of the coming genera-
tion.
"Engineering multiplies the means for
the earlier relief of the two kinds of dark-
ness with which civilized humanity is con-
cerned, the physical absence of light and
the mental absence of knowledge.
"Turning night into day at first seemed
sacriligious but is now accepted as some-
thing of everyday necessity. The history
of illumination is truly romantic, the fiery
coal, the torch of pitch, animal oil, the
candle, the coal oil lamp, natural and arti-
ficial gases, and successive steps in elec-
trical illumination marking the accelera-
tion of means of better lighting. Now
man utilizes his lengthened day to dispel
the fears of mental darkness, to light his
path of travel, to foster amusement, and
to extend the opportunities for education,
commerce, and social intercourse.
"The dispelling of mental darkness
which this has made possible is even more
vital to life, liberty, aand the pursuit of
happiness. The use of "midnight oil" has
produced world leaders and most of the
modern miracles of engineering. But
whither our way? More production for
comfort or more books for knowledge?
Perhaps more schools and fewer smoke-
stacks, more fine community edifices and
fewer factories, more leisure and more
light, are the present needs of our people.
In any case, engineering talent must and
will aid in directing the tendencies of our
time.
"To the Engineer! To his rich heritage
from the labors of past generations and
scientists, he adds his contributions. He
continues the work of forcing outward
the challenging barriers that separate
Man's efforts from the impossible.
"The engineer is the master of the laws
of nature. On a solid foundation of math-
ematics and science he has reared the
structure of civilization. He is the great
coordinator. He plans and directs the
construction of projects representing the
investment of millions of dollars and the

gates with open mind and gets the facts
before making decisions. He plans with
thoroughness and builds with fidelity.
"But what do you think? Are you a
proponent of an advanced culture made
possible by an engineering world or are
you a backer of science as the surest aid
to comfortable living and happiness?"
Engineering Leadership and The
Human Equation
"Many brilliant technically trained
men fail to attain chief executive rank
because they concentrate so exclusively on
eengineering and similar problems that
they neglect the study of the psychology
and nature of the men with whom they
must be associated. They become masters
at the handling of machinery, formulas,
and materials but they remain utter no-
vices at the handling and coordinating of
groups of working men. One fact must
never be allowed to become forgotten.
That is that the world of industry is also
a world of finance and that, while seeking
the aid of the clever engineer, it is look-
ing for more than just a high degree of
technical knowledge, however profound.
The men called to leadership must have,
besides intelligence and the required
amount of training, an appreciation of the
springs of men and the ability to direct
and inspire them to greater efforts.
"This is strikingly exemplified among
the large engineering and construction
firms around the country. Without proper
administration of personnel aand direc-
tion of finances, these enormous organi-
zations could never be successful. It is
simple deduction which leads to the fact
that they must have capable business and
financial leadership. And the majority
of these posts are and always will be filled
with the better suited talents of engineers.
But it is also an evident fact and an only
natural occurrence that when a high grade
technical engineer with little or no de-
veloped executive and business ability is
competing for an administrative position,
with a high grade executive without
technical knowledge, the choice will fall
justly to the latter.
"When a position of monumental im-
portance is to be filled, a Board of Di-
rectors looks for several very necessary
qualities. First and most important, has
he the required talent and ability? Sec-
ond and of increasing weight, does he
know how to inspire loyalty and handle
men successfully? He must know men,
the impulses of human nature, and the
ways of pointing their abilities to the best
interests of all concerned. In other words;
'With all thy getting, get understanding'."
For a change in the lighter direction
we turn back the pages of old Technics
another twenty-five years to the 1908 issue
where the following poem appeared with
this letter of introduction:
"A day or so ago a Scotch friend of
mine, and a University of Glasgow man,
gave me the enclosed verses, by Professor
Rankine. I don't know that they were
ever published though you may have seen
them. This gentleman was a neighbor of
Lord Kelvin and remembered Professor
Rankine, though he never knew him per-
sonally, aand some of the Professor's
verses fell into his hands.
"I thought it might be of interest to
the many Technic readers who have
sweat over Rankine's Theories, to know
that the gentleman had some lighter mo-
ments."
A Mathematician fell madly in love
With a lady, young, handsome, and
charming:
By angles and ratios harmonic he strove
Her curves and proportions all fault-
less to prove,
As he scrawled hieroglyphics alarming.
He measured with care, from the ends of
a base,
The arcs which her features subtended;
Then he framed transcendental equations,
to trace
The flowing outlines of her figure and
face,
And thought the result very splendid.
He studied (since music has charms for
the fair)
The theory of fiddles and whistles,—
Then composed, by acoustic equations, an
air,
Which, when 'twas performed, made
the lady's long hair
Stand on end, like a porcupine's bristles.
The lady loved dancing,—he therefore
applied,
To the polka and waltz, an equation;
But when to rotate on his axis he tried,
His center of gravity swayed to one
side,
And he fell, by the earth's gravitation.
No doubts of the fate of his suit made
him pause,
For he proved to his own satisfaction,
That the fair one returned his affection—
"because,
"As every one knows, by mechanical
laws,
"Re-action is equal to action."
"Let x denote beauty,—y, manner well-
bred,—
"z, Fortune,—(this last is essential)—
"Let L stand for love"—our philosopher
said,—
"Of the kind which is known as po-
tential."
L = * (x, y, z)
"Now integrate L with respect to dt,
"(t standing for time and persuasion);
"Then, between proper limits, 'tis easy
to see,
"The definite integral Marriage must
be-
"(A very concise demonstration)."

Said he—"If the wandering course of the
moon
"By Algebra can be predicted,
"The female affections must yield to it
soon"—
—But the lady ran off with a dashing
dragoon,
And left him amazed and afflicted.
It's easy to see why Rankine stayed in
math rather than becoming a poet.

Henri Poincare... on disinterested fools
"But scientists believe that there is a hierarchy of facts,
and that we may make a judicious choice among them.
They are right, for otherwise there would he no science,
and science does exist. One has only to open one s eyes
to see that the triumphs of industry, which have enriched
so many practical men. would never have seen the light
if only these practical men had existed, and if they had
not been preceded by disinterested fools who died poor,
THE RAND CORPORATION,
A nonprofit organization engaged in research on pr
who never thought of the useful, and who were not
guided by their own caprice.
What these fools did, as Mach has said, was to save their
successors the trouble of thinking. If they had worked
solely with a view to immediate application, they would
have left nothing behind them, and in face of a new
requirement, all would have had to be done again.

Automatic Missile-Firing Base Is
Called 'One Step Beyond Push-
Button Warfare'
"This goes one step beyond push-
button warfare, for at the Talos Defense
Unit you don't even need to push a but-
ton to send this weapon into action."
That was the description given October
15 by Dr. Elmer W. Engstrom, Senior
Executive Vice President, Radio Corpora-
tion of America, of the Talos Defense
Unit, the first completely automatic sys-
tem for firing and guiding missiles to
their targets. The base—an electronic
control center which can go into action
by itself in response to warning signals
from remote outposts—was built by RCA
on the White Sands proving ground and
turned over to the Defense Department.
"A decade ago," Dr. Engstrom said, "it
would have seemed like a figment of
science fiction to speak of a base that
could fire a missile and guide it to its
target without help of a human hand.
But here it is, before you, today."
The Talos Defense Unit (TDU) is
composed of three structures—one a long,
low concrete and steel building (319 x
80 feet horizontally, 30 feet tall) contain-
ing the control center, and the other two
circular magazines with the launchers,
resembling anti-aircraft guns, in the center
and numerous cells on the perimeter to
house the missiles themselves. All three
are built to withstand the pressures of the
missile take-off and near misses from
enemy bombs, and all are air-filtered for
protection of the equipment and person-
nel.
In general terms—and within the
bounds of military security— this is
what the TDU is designed to do:
Suppose a fleet of enemy bombers, or
perhaps a single missile, is detected by
one of the numerous warning systems
spanning the North American continent.
A signal is sent to the TDU, where it is
received by a series of data-handling and
computing machines. These decode the in-
formation and analyze the number of
attackers, their location, course and speed
of approach.
Next a scheduling and programming
computer sets the logical points of inter-
ception. Then it starts the machinery to
load the missiles onto the launchers and
fire them at the proper time and in the
proper direction.
In this stage—still without the lifting
of a human hand—the blast-proof con-
crete-and-steel cell doors swing open to
release the missile the computer has se-
lected. The cells have reinforced concrete
walls two feet thick and are so constructed
that, should one of the missiles go off
by mistake, the blast would go upward
through the roof rather than horizon-
tally to detonate the other missiles,
As a cell is opened, one of the launch-
ers circles to face it and sends a small
cart down a railed bridge to the door.
Swiftly the missile is loaded on the cart
and rolled onto the launcher.
The "Talos" missile is about 20 feet
long, 30 inches in diameter and weighs
3,000 pounds. It is accelerated by a large
solid fuel booster rocket some 10 feet
long, which is jettisoned when the missile
reaches cruising speed. At this time the
main ramjet engine, using kerosene as
fuel, ignites and provides thrust to keep
the missile at constant speed through-
out its flight. The engine develops 40,000
horsepower.
Completion of the land-based unit now
enables the Army to use the same weapon
produced for the Navy, an important
factor from an economy standpoint.
Sandwich Rolling Produces Thin
Sheets of Stainless Steel
Steel prototypes of the famed Dagwood
sandwich have been experimentally roll-
ed at Homestead District Works of
U. S. Steel Corp. They are expected to
have wide significance in the aircraft and
missile fabrication fields.
Results of the research and develop-
ment project produced the widest thin-
gage stainless steel sheets in the world.
The experiments have achieved a break-
through in the rolling of stainless and
alloy steel sheets and hold promise of
adding a new dimension to future mill-
produced materials for aircraft and mis-
siles.
This has been accomplished by a "sand-
wich" rolling process developed by How-
ard S. Orr. Through this process, U. S.
Steel has demonstrated the feasibility of
producing steel sheets up to 90 inches
wide—nearly twice the width of light-
gage stainless and alloy sheets now be-
ing made by conventional methods.
Translated to terms of aircraft material
and design, the wide sheets are an avenue
toward more rapid production and less
36
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


weight. Where aircraft requirements call
for alloy and stainless steel sheet wider
than now available, these material limita-
tions require joining of two or more
sheets. As more and more alloy and
stainless steel is used in aircraft and mis-
siles, wide sheets offer a significant saving
in weight, plus design and fabrication
simplification.
A typical steel Dagwood consists of
two carbon steel cover plates each one
inch thick. Between them goes a filling
of four stainless steel plates each 5/16-
inch thick and treated with a separating
compound. The sandwich is held to-
gether with welded-in side and end bars.
Prior to rolling, the sandwich is about
three inches thick.
Heated to high temperature the sand-
wich is put through a rolling mill at
Homestead District Works. Reduced each
time it passes through the massive rolls,
the sandwich becomes progressively thin-
ner, longer and wider until it is a
plate approximately %-inch thick, 100
inches wide and 250 inches long.
In the rolling process each layer of the
sandwich undergoes the same amount of
reduction in thickness. Rolled to a total
reduction of 90%, the 5/16-inch thick
stainless steel plates are reduced to a nom-
inal thickness of .33 of an inch each.
After cooling, the edges of the huge
plate are trimmed and the thin-gage sheets
are lifted from atop each other.
The sandwich technique has solved
some vexing problems that have pro-
hibited rolling of wide alloy and stain-
less steel sheets. For one thing, thin-gage
sheets rolled singly become cool quickly
and require tremendous mill power to
achieve reduction as the cooling goes on.
The sandwich technique offers many
immediate advantages that have encour-
aged further experiments at U.S. Steel to
refine the method.
Because of its initial thickness, the
sandwich tends to retain sufficient heat
for the entire rolling operation. In roll-
ing, the sandwich has the working charac-
teristics of the carbon steel cover plates
rather than the tough stainless or alloy
steels inside.
This minimizes the need for excessive
rolling mill power requirements. Existing
facilities at Homestead District Works
are used to experimentally produce the
light-gage "difficult to roll" alloy and
stainless steel sheets.

Mechanical Hands
Mechanical "hands" that can dis-
assemble an aircraft jet engine "bolt by
bolt" are part of the remote handling
equipment in one of the world's largest
shops for handling radio-active equip-
ment.
The huge "hot" shop, 160 feet long,
50 feet wide and 63 feet high, is part of
the Atomic Energy Commission's test fa-
cilities utilized by the General Electric
Company at Idaho Falls, Ida.
Remote handling tools in the "shop"
range from a 100-ton crane down through
O'Man, a huge mechanical "arm" de-
signed and built by General Electric, to a
much smaller master-slave manipulator
for making intricate mechanical adjust-
ments.
The O'Man manipulator can handle
from 500 to 3,000 pounds, depending on
the arm length and position used. This
giant manipulator is suspended from a
crane bridge and can cover the entire
working area of the shop.
Operators of these manipulators and
four other electrically controlled wall-
mounted manipulators are protected by
concrete walls some seven feet thick and
by nine windows of lead glass and zinc
bromide, six feet thick. Each window
contains 500 gallons of zinc bromide to
protect operators from stray nuclear ra-
diation.
Enough controls are located at each
window to operate any piece of servicing
equipment in the entire shop. Radio con-
tact can be maintained by operators in the
control galleries with other operating sites
and with a lead shielded locomotive used
to haul equipment to be maintained in and
out of the huge shop.
The shop is serviced by a track sys-
tem which enters through large remote-
controlled double doors at the west end.
Smaller entrances are provided for person-
nel who must enter the "hot" shop.
On the floor of the shop are two large
capacity turntables for rotating heavy
equipment that must be serviced. Rotation
of these nuclear aircraft propulsion equip-
ment components provides easier access
by tool and better view from any of the
nine observation windows.
Connecting with the main "hot" shop
are smaller shops for handling radio-
active equipment, including one area for
servicing O'Man and other remote
handling equipment.
Also connecting with the "hot" shop
by water canal is a water-filled storage
pool for fuel elements and other radio-
active units. The pool, 120 feet long, 60
across and 24 deep, is filled with water
that is much purer than ordinary dis-
tilled water for sale in drug stores.
Visual observation of work in the
"hot" shop is difficult because distances
involved between observer and equipment
often exceed 50 feet.
Six of the viewing windows in the
main shop are 18 feet above the shop
floor and two are 30 feet above it. One
window is located in the cell for main-
taining the remote handling equipment.
Viewing aids used include binoculars,
spotting telescopes, mirrors and closed
circuit industrial television, with prepara-
tion being made for installation of a
television network that includes black and
white, color, 3-D stereo vision or any
combination of these, with viewing
screens at all operator locations.
Depth perception depends to a great
extent on the stereo vision of the tech-
nician, since size, color and shadows are
not always available as depth perception
aids.
To help provide operators with needed
depth perception, the "hot" shop opera-
tions unit has set up a program for selec-
tion and development of manipulator
technicians with respect to stereo vision.
Signals are Bounced from
Meteor Trails
High-frequency radio signals, bounced
from meteor trails 60 to 100 miles above
the earth, have been used experimentally
for the first time to transmit images of
printed material over a distance of nearly
1,000 miles without relays, the Radio
Corporation of America has announced.
The disclosure came in a report dated
November 12, by three RCA Laboratories
scientists that special facsimile equipment
has performed successfully in preliminary
tests of meteor-path propagation between
the transmitting station of the National
Bureau of Standards at Havana, Illinois,
and the RCA Laboratories radio research
installation at Riverhead, Long Island.
This is an airline distance of 910 miles.
The novel system was developed for the
Cambridge Research Center of the Air
Research and Development Command.
Principals in the development were War-
ren H. Bliss, of the technical staff at
RCA's David Sarnoff Research Center in
Princeton, N. J., and R. J. Wagner, Jr.,
and G. B. Wickizer, of the RCA Labora-
tories radio research staff at Riverhead.
Basic research in the field of meteor
trails has been conducted in this country
notably at Stanford University and the
Bureau of Standards, much of it spon-
sored by the Department of Defense, as
well as in Canada and the United King-
dom. In recent years more attention has
been given to the effects of meteor reflec-
tion on communications.
Because radio reflections from meteor
trails were believed to be of importance
to the Air Force, the Propagation Labora-
tory of The Cambridge Research Center
had initiated a meteor program in 1953.
As a result of this program, Dr. Philip
Newman and Dr. Joseph Casey of the
Cambridge Center came to the conclusion
that it should be possible to make radio
transmission of visual material via meteor
trails. RCA, at the request of the Air
Force, developed special equipment
to investigate this possibility. The first
trail of this equipment during early
autumn met with instant success. How-
ever, the meteor trail phenomenon is a
complicated one and considerable further
research will be required to determine
how best to exploit this new capability.
The RCA scientists gave this explana-
tion of meteor trail propagation:
When a meteor enters the thin upper
atmosphere of the earth, the high ve-
locity of its passages causes the air parti-
cles to break down into positive and nega-
tive ions. This trail of ionized air, which
may persist during a time interval ranging
from one-tenth of a second up to several
minutes after the passage of the meteor,
acts as a reflector of radio signals which
would otherwise radiate out into space.
Along a transmission path of the type
used in the experimental facsimile system,
ionized meteor trails appear on an aver-
age of several times a minute to close the
circuit between transmitter and receiver.
The research team pointed out that
meteor path propagation promises ulti-
mately to increase the versatility of all
radio communications by providing a
means of sending information at times
and over distances for which other means
may not be available. It also offers a
valuable means of supplementing the
overcrowded radio spectrum.
According to the report of the three
scientists, the experimental RCA system
functions this way:
The material to be transmitted is re-
corded on 35 millimeter film, which is
scanned to produce a signal in a manner
similar to the techniques used in television
film transmission. The resulting signal is
sent out from the transmitter through a
highly directive antenna aimed in the di-
rection of the distant receiver. At the re-
ceiver, the signal is picked up by another

ielps speed careers at Western Electric
ight now, Western Electric engineers are back "on campus"
» a unique new Graduate Engineering Training Program,
hey're attending courses at special study centers established
y the company in Chicago, New York and Winston-Salem,
f. C. It's a rare chance to study advanced engineering and get
ill pay at the same time.
These "students" are guided by a teaching staff of top West-
rn Electric engineers, outside experts and professors from
;ading universities. They're learning the latest technical devel-
pments ... boning up on everything from manufacturing proc-
sses to computer applications.
When the program reaches its peak, some 2,000 to 3,000 West-
rn Electric engineers will attend each year... studying in an
tmosphere as close to a university graduate school as is prac-
cal for industry.
This engineering "university" was born because of the ever-
icreasing complexity of Western Electrics job as the manu-
icturing and supply unit of the Bell Telephone System. Today
V". E. engineers are right in the middle of exciting fields like
rvicrowave radio relay, electronic switching and automation,
iraduate engineering training is designed to spur their devel-
pment and advancement throughout their entire careers.
How Graduate Engineering Training would work for you
he program gets under way after approximately six months on-the-job
stperience. First off:
. A nine-week Introduction to Western Electric Engineering helps you
learn about your W.E. engineering field, sharpens your skills in Retting
ideas across. Technical subjects include communications systems, prod-
uct design principles, military electronic systems.
. Another nine-week program, General Development, starts after your
first year with us, helps broaden and strengthen your engineering back-
ground. Besides technical subjects like engineering statistics, measure-
ments and instrumentation, and electronics, you receive grounding in
human relations and the socio-economic importance of engineering.
I. To meet continuing needs for formalized technical training, Advanced
Development offers four-week courses tailored to the individual needs
of the engineers selected to attend. These courses are designed to help
develop creative engineering abilities. Computer applications, switcliing
theory, feedback control systems, and semi-conductor devices and cir-
cuits are sample topics covered in this phase.
Besides taking part in the Graduate Engineering Training Pro-
gram, engineers are eligible for our Tuition Refund Plan for

Acting Dean STEPHEN S. ATTWOOD
Two statements have come to my attention in recent weeks
which summarize quite well the status of scientists and
engineers in our society today. Both statements were made by
the same man, Dr. Howard L. Bevis, chairman of the Presi-
dent's Committee on Scientists and Engineers. Dr. Bevis has
written:
In today's competition for man's mind, science and
technology are foremost. If the uncommitted countries
come to believe that technological progress is at a faster
rate in Russia, we have lost a major battle. If in the
future the Russians demonstrate again and again that
they are ahead, not only in certain fields, but in many
fields, then our situation will be critical.
His second observation is as follows:
Even if through some miracle, international tensions
were to be relaxed overnight, our expanding economy,
exploding population, and our tremendous dependence
on technology make it obvious that more scientists,
engineers and technicians are going to be needed.
In short, our nation requires more scientists and engineers,
and will require even more of them in the future. I am sure
you have all read this any number of times, particularly since
the Russian successes with earth satellites and missiles.
This is not to say that every high school student should
decide overnight to become an atomic physicist or an electronics
engineer primarily because there is great need for these men.
regardless of his aptitudes and interests. This would be unfair
to the individual and to our society. It should be emphasized
that the student should pursue that work which interests him,
be it medicine or law or economics or sociology.
I do feel, however, that our society is essentially a tech-
nological one, and, in order to live with any understanding
of it, a student would benefit from greater knowledge of the
natural and physical sciences, whether he wishes to obtain a
higher education or not.
For those of you who are planning a career in engineering,
or have already embarked on one, I should like to emphasize
the importance of the engineer's three forms of expression:
mathematics, engineering drawing and the English language.
With the accumulation of more and more knowledge, man
has systematized his past observations and facts in mathemati-

train the increasing numbers of students
and relief from obsolesence are matters
of utmost concern. In any such facilities
program, it becomes necessary to estab-
lish the use to which any one facility will
be put, know what the faculty visualize in
laboratory activity not only for the im-
mediate but the rather far-distant future
and to the development the space in such
a way that the cost of construction and
the operating budgets be kept to a mini-
mum.
Engineering laboratories are areas in
which the research worker or student ex-
periences the application of science to
specialized technological development. In
the case of the undergraduate student, his
laboratory experience is largely confined
to learning the physical phenomena pre-
dicted by the basic principles and funda-
mentals of the profession. The laboratory
activity of the graduate student and the
faculty member is directed toward the ex-
tension of the fundamental knowledge in
the several technological areas of develop-
ment through advanced application of the
sciences and mathematics. The space that
has heretofore been occupied by labora-
tories reflects the two functions. A space
is obsolete when it no longer serves both.
Complete obsolescence is a fact in many
educational institutions.
It became apparent to the University
management and the Board of Regents
several years ago that land area exceeding
the amount available in the immediate
vicinity of the Main Campus would be re-
quired at the time of any appreciable
facilities expansion. A 300 acre tract of
land northeast of the Main Campus and
to the north side of the Huron River was
accordingly acquired. Through subse-
quent land purchases, this area, known as
the North Campus, now includes approxi-
mately 1,000 acres.
The North Campus is the site of the
Mortimer E. Cooley Building, the Phoenix
Memorial Laboratory, the Ford Nuclear
Reactor, the Aeronautical Engineering
Laboratory, the Automotive Engineering
Laboratory, the Fluids Engineering Lab-
oratory, a portion of which is under con-
struction, and a large married students'
housing development. The North Cam-
pus, further, is the site upon which fu-
ture planned facilities for the College ot
Engineering will be constructed.
The concept of "Areas of Engineering
Activity" has been projected into the
planning of laboratory facilities. Early
studies of space needs of the several pro-
fessional departments indicated that cer-
tain interests required a common type of
physical plan, where height, width, floor
loading and utilities supply were uni-
versal needs for their separate laboratory
activities. A need for flexibility was very
apparent. Further, common physical lab-
oratory equipment with minor variation
seemed to satisfy the needs of several de-
partments. Although it was obviously im-
possible, because of the number of stu-
dents, to eliminate duplication of any
given kind of equipment, certain econo-
mies of space and instrumentation and a
relatively high use-factor could be assured.
As a result of faculty planning,, a series
of laboratories have been projected for
the College of Engineering. The Aero-
nautical and Automotive Engineering
Laboratories have been completed and are
occupied. The Fluids Engineering Lab-
oratory is under construction. The Ma-
terials, Metallurgy, and Structures Labora-
tory, the Highway Engineering Labora-
tory, the Sanitary Engineering Laboratory,
the Classroom, Office and Small Labora-
tories Buildings have been planned and
specified by the faculty. These labora-
tories are all planned to permit a wide
range of studies in important areas of
engineering.
For instance, the Automotive Labora-
tory is a facility where power generation
from fuels may be studied. The inter-
nal combustion engine, the gas turbine,
the free-piston engine, and the rocket
engine may be studied in an enclosure,
partitioned and sound insulated so tha:
the activity is isolated from a second
study. Adequate ventilation is supplied to
carry off noxious gases resulting from
the combustion cycles. Each space is sup

How RCA brings a richer, wider range
of musical sound to your home
Before high fidelity, the
sound of recorded music
was limited—much as
piano music would be if
you could hear only the
notes played on the center
of the keyboard. No
rich bass notes, no keen,
vibrant highs.
RCA achievements in the science of
sound and acoustics changed all that.
Today, with RCA Victor records and
high fidelity "Victrolas," the full range
of sound is reproduced so faithfully
that you can enjoy music almost as
though you were there.
And now, Stereophonic Sound! A
new and dramatic dimension in re-
corded music is also yours to enjoy
on RCA high fidelity instruments.
Stereophonic units can be added to
most "Victrola"® Hi-Fi systems any
time you choose.
In this, as in almost every area of
electronic progress in home entertain-
ment, defense and industry, the leader-
ship of RCA serves you. RCA means
electronics at its best!

plied by fuel from remote storage. The
latest type of instrumentation and dyna-
mometer equipment is installed for use
by the engineering students.
The Aeronautical Engineering Labora-
tories consists of two buildings, one of
which houses the supersonic and low
turbulence wind tunnels, and the other,
the propulsion activities in Aeronautical
Engineering. Shock-wave studies in su-
personic flow is carried on using the
interferometer and schlieren optical sys-
tems. The use of rockets in upper atmo-
sphere research has been a continuing
activity of students and faculty in this
field of engineering.
The Fluids Engineering Laboratory, as
the name implies, is planned to accomo-
date the student in his study of the be-
havior of fluids, not only liquid but
gases. Every engineering activity, in one
way or another, is concerned with fluids.
A complete faculty in all professional di-
visions and the student engineers from
these divisions will participate in the
work housed in this laboratory.
Each laboratory in the program is plan-
ned and designed to accommodate the
most up-to-date instrumentation and
equipment. The plans provide for more
qualified students who will be seeking a
technical training. The buildings and pro-
grams are developed to permit the great-
est possible flexibility in engineering edu-
cation.
In addition to the faculty's plans for
North Campus, the College of Engineer-
ing has cooperated in a University of
Michigan expansion at the Dearborn Cen-
ter, Dearborn, Michigan. Initially, the
Departments of Mechanical and Industrial
Engineering will offer their complete edu-
cational programs to both undergraduate
and graduate students on a cooperative
basis with various industries in the metro-
politan area. Other departments of the
Engineering College have initially de-
veloped plans for teaching at the Dear-
born Center to the extent that their sep-
arate teaching is required in the complete
programs.
Building plans to accommodate approx-
imately 1,000 students per year trans-
ferring from the junior colleges have been
completed and the plant which includes
an engineering laboratory, a classroom
building, office building, and a student
center will be constructed on the land area
of the Ford Fairlane estate using the
$6,500,000.00 grant from the Ford Motor
Company for the project.
The College of Engineering at the Uni-
versity of Michigan has, for many years,
made available to the qualified student a
vigorous, thorough grounding in engi-
neering. The many alumni in key posi-
tions attest to this fact. The faculty has
always been alert to the changing need for
instruction as the technology progresses.
The programs are continually being ex-
amined for the needs of men in new
fields of development. For instance, the
guided missile requires engineers with a
thorough education in the sciences and
mathematics and a knowledge of such
engineering subjects as fuels and combus-
tion, fluid flow, machinery, control sys-
tems, metallurgy, and electrical circuits
and fields, all of which are combined to
produce the design of a machine, the
guided missile, which will perform in
accordance with the demands of a given
mission. The combined efforts of the
astronomer, the physicist, the aerodynam-
icist, the civil, chemical, electrical and
mechanical engineer are all brought to
bear to accomplish the mission.
The faculty believes that the educa-
tional programs are directed to provide
the fundamental information in order that
the graduate engineer may conduct, ana-
lyze, and interpret the results of scientific
and engineering laboratory experiments
that precede the design of the com-
pleted machine. It further believes that
the new laboratories provide the qualified
student with the facilities where he can
learn by experience under the direction
given by the several professional divisions
whose interests are focused on common
areas of engineering activity. Certainly,
the engineer of the future, the present
student, can look forward to a profes-
sional career which will be equally as
satisfying for a life's work as for all those
who were once student engineers. A bril-
liant future awaits those who qualify.
Why Vought Projects
Bring Out The Best
In An Engineer
At Vought, the engineer doesn't often
forget past assignments. Like all big
events, they leave vivid memories.
And it's no wonder.
For here the engineer contributes to
history-making projects — among
them the record-breaking Crusader
fighter; the Regulus II missile, chosen
to arm our newest nuclear subs; and
the new fast-developing 1,500-plus-
mph fighter, details of which are still
classified.
The Vought engineer watches such
weapons take shape. He supervises
critical tests, and he introduces the
weapons to the men with whom they
will serve.
Engineers with many specialties share
these experiences. Today, for exam-
ple, Vought is at work on important
projects involving:
electronics design and manufacture
inertia! navigation
investigation of advanced propulsion
methods
Mach 5 configurations
Vought's excellent R&amp;D facilities
help the engineer through unexplored
areas. And by teaming up with other
specialists against mutual challenges,
the Vought engineer learns new fields
while advancing in his own.

ONE OF A SERIES
The structures engineer who
found a fast detour
"Advise and assist on structural problems.
Do what you can to keep the program moving .. ."
With this outline of his liaison duties, Stress Analyst
Ed Clay accompanied Vought's Regulus II missile to
its desert test site.
On the desert, Ed found a dearth of structural
problems. Regulus II reliability gave the flight test
program tremendous momentum. In quick succession
the missile notched 10 flights. When time came for a
critical high-speed test, the program was three
months ahead of schedule!
Then, the very fact that things had moved so
fast threatened to rob the program of the time it
had gained.
As Vought had planned, a wind tunnel flutter test
had to precede the upcoming high-speed flight.
But Vought's prearranged date at a government
tunnel was over a month away. The facility was
booked solidly up to the appointed day. And Vought's
own Mach 5 tunnel was under construction.
Then Ed revealed the scope of his liaison. It had
ranged to the rocket test track at nearby Edwards Air
Force Base. There, with the help of a cooperative
track project engineer, Ed had spotted a rusting
rocket sled, left behind from a radome test. Now, if
the sled could be rigged to carry that spare Regu-
lus fin, Ed figured, they might get flutter data before
the tunnel test.
That changed Ed's state of liaison. All Vought
was suddenly at his service. Shopmen reworked the
sled to mount the fin. Instrumentation technicians
fitted the fin with gages and transducers. Vought's top
flutter men double-checked, raised their eyebrows,
then endorsed the whole thing.
At the track, moments before the rockets exploded,
Ed had a twinge of doubt. His sled was a mon-
ster, indeed. Air loads would be terrific .. .
Then the sled shot off on the first of two success-
ful trips that revealed all the data required.
At Chance Vought, there's liaison in spirit as well as
in name. It allies engineers of many specialties and view-
points against mutual problems. It builds channels
instead of walls between diverse technical areas.
It's another reason why top engineers are choosing
Vought — to keep abreast of all fields while advancing
in one.

binations of resins are usually far superior.
Formulation of a resin mixture is an art as
much as it is a science, and it embraces,
essentially, all of high polymer theory
and practice. The subject, which can be
only briefly treated in an article of this
scope, is deferred until after the major
categories are discussed.
Thermosetting resins are high molecu-
lar weight, three dimensional molecules
which are very strong, relatively speaking,
and are stable at high temperatures. Be-
cause of their structure they have certain
disadvantages: they shrink during the
curing operation, they have high thermal
coefficients of expansion, and they are
quite rigid and have low impact resistance.
The high thermal coefficients of expan-
sion are especially undesirable, for since
the coefficients of metals are compara-
tively low, the changes in temperature to
which the joints are subjected cause con-
siderable stress within the adhesives,
thereby reducing the ultimate applied
strength. (7, 10) Thermosetting resins
are employed to support appreciable loads
or to withstand high temperatures, if sat-
isfactory combinations of properties can
be developed.
Thermoplastic resins are essentially one
dimensional molecules, and therefore are
not as strong as the thermosetting resins.
Furthermore, they melt or soften at tem-
peratures not far above the boiling point
of water. Their impact resistance is inter-
mediate between thermosetting and elasto-
meric resins. The low strength and only
fair impact resistance of thermoplastic
resins limit their use to non-structural
applications, such as attaching metal
nameplates to metal housings. (7)
Elastomeric resins are also one dimen-
sional molecules of strength comparable
to that of thermoplastic resins. But their
superior impact resistance and fatigue
failure resistance make them valuable in
certain applications. Moreover, although
the cohesive strengths of elastomeric
resins are not high, there is practically no
loss in ultimate applied strengths because
of stresses induced by differences in the
properties of the metals and the ad-
hesives. Consequently, if the strength
requirements are not severe, elastomeric
resins are well suited for applications
where temperature changes are significant.
(?)
Since strength requirements are usually
the limiting factor in a decision to use
adhesive bonding, thermosetting resins
are generally considered first and then
are modified to achieve optimum proper-
ties by adding inert fillers—glass wool,
silica, alumina, asbestos, metal powders,
etc.—and/or thermoplastic or elastomeric
resins. (1, 7, 10) However, the addition
of a filler, besides improving the inherent
disadvantages (10% carbon black reduces
the thermal coefficient of expansion of a
phenol-formaldehyde resin by 20%
(10)), also reduces the ultimate strength
somewhat and creates other problems.
(4)
More specifically: Almost all resins
have lower Young's moduli than the
metals they join—a very desirable feature;
however, inorganic fillers have high
Young's moduli, and their incorporation
into a resin mixture in amounts sufficient
to produce other favorable properties
often raises the modulus of the mixture
to a value greater than that of the metals.
(7) If too much low molecular weight
resin is added to the thermosetting resin
as a plasticizer in an attempt to lower the
viscosity and thereby obtain more inti-
mate contact with the metal surfaces or to
increase impact resistance, the adhesive
will fail in cohesion instead of in adhe-
sion. (7, 9)
In some cases it is possible to increase
the specific adhesion of an adhesive by in-
corporating the proper type of resin. For
a lasting bond, the metal surfaces must be
wet not only by the vehicle at the time
of the original application, but also by the
resin itself. The wetting power of the
adhesive is improved if the molecules
are composed of many different kinds of
atoms instead of only a few kinds and
if the molecules are asymmetric instead
of symmetric. (11) The wet ability of
the adhesive is also improved if the micro-
dimensional periodicities of the adhesive
match those of the metal surface. (2,
21)
Other components in most resin mix-
tures which are to be used as adhesives
are curing agents, catalysts, extenders
(fillers added to reduce cost while main-
taining the bulk), and, of course, the
vehicle in emulsion and solution forms.
(7)
Applicability of Adhesive Bonding
The topic of applicability of adhesive
bonding of metals, which is, of course,
the main subject of this article, can best
be discussed and appreciated with the
background already presented. It is for
this reason that it has been reserved until
the end for treatment.
The primary requisite of any means ot
joining two materials is its ability to
withstand the applied loads. Almost uni-
versally, adhesive bonded joints ire
stronger than riveted joints. For 1/16"
metal sheets, ]/&gt;" lap joints, the nominal
strength using a phenol-formaldehyde
resin is given in Table 1. Table 2 com-
pares riveted and bonded structures which

are alike in all respects except the methods

bonded structures are stronger is the
fact that they are not subject to stress

This is because no two projects undertaken by the company
are ever exactly alike.
Kellogg is the pre-eminent leader —on an international as
well as national scale —in the design and construction of
modern refineries and chemical plants.
It has gained and maintained this position through continu-
ous laboratory research and engineering development.
Professional staffs here are constantly at work developing
new and improved processing methods, engineering stand-
ards, mechanical equipment and on-site as well as lab and
shop testing techniques.
Young men who join this company work with associates
responsible for such achievements as:
... engineering 60% of the world's fluid catalytic cracking
... designing and building the U-235 gaseous diffusion
plant at Oak Ridge
... perfecting fluid hydroforming process
... designing and constructing production facilities for
ethylene, phthalic anhydride, ammonia, phenol and
acetone, penicillin, edible glycerides.
Diversity and accomplishment are the rule at Kellogg, as
engineers and scientists work together toward modernizing
and improving the productivity of basic petroleum and
chemical facilities and processing, as well as in the develop-
ment of new industrial products from petro-chemical
research.
The young professional man gains variety of experience
here, and the opportunity to make a name in any given field,
or to broaden into technical administrative work. Other
stimuli to professional development at Kellogg are in-plant

Some Fantastic Figures
Late in the evening of Sunday, Decem-
ber 19, 1954, a steam turbine unit in
the Commonwealth Edison's Ridgeland,
Illinois, generating station was returned
to service after a routine maintenance job
on its boiler. About midnight, the tur-
bine's spindle shattered, sending metal
shafts, blades, and casing all over the
station and the surrounding countryside.
A five-ton chunk of steel was found sev-
eral hundred feet across the station, and
another of 200 lbs. turned up nearly a
half mile away. Its passage had left the
station with a 50-ft. square hole in the
roof.
Two were killed and five injured in
the mishap, which deprived Common-
wealth of 600,000 kw. at the peak of the
holiday season, when power demands are
highest.
The exploded turbine was a com-
pound arrangement of a 50,000-kw. 3600-
rpm high-pressure unit and a 100,000-
kw., 1800-rpm. low-pressure unit. The ex-
plosion occurred in the low pressure unit.
Other nearby generating equipment was
damaged, accounting for the heavy loss
of capacity.
Subsequent studies of the Ridgeland
turbine showed that severe metal fatigue
and "undue stress and wear" had appar-
ently been responsible for the failure.
Some Are On the Lighter Side
Not all engineering failures have had
such dire consequences. Back around the
turn of the century, a huge molasses
storage tank in Boston burst, unleashing a
tidal wave of that gooey substance that
flooded blocks and even knocked down an
elevated railway (details are lacking)—it
is said that even today, on the hottest
summer days, one can catch a faint odor
from the encrusted liquid where it has
seeped into buildings and pavement.
Principally, engineering deals with the
absolute, and so long as one deals with
familiar problems, there is little room
for error, granted reasonable care in pro-
ceeding. However, when engineers be-
come something less than completely
conscientious, or where unusual condi-
tions arise to tax their judgment, there is
a definite chance for a tragic blunder of
miscalculation or omission. Neither men
nor materials are infallible, but men alone
can determine the quality of their labors.
START TODAY TO
PLAN TOMORROW
By knowing about some of the projects underway at the
Babcock &amp; Wilcox Company, an engineer may see his
personal avenues of growth and advancement. For today
B&amp;W stands poised at a new era of expansion and
development.
Here's an indication of what's going on at B&amp;W, with
the consequent opportunities that are opening up for
engineers. The Boiler Division is building the world's
largest steam generator. The Tubular Products Division
recently introduced extruded seamless titanium tubing,
one result of its metallurgical research. The Refractories
Division developed the first refractory concrete that will
withstand temperatures up to 3200 F. The Atomic Energy
Division is under contract by the AEC to design and
build the propulsion unit of the world's first nuclear-
powered cargo vessel.
These are but a few of the projects — not in the plan-
ning stage, but in the actual design and manufacturing
phases — upon which B&amp;W engineers are now engaged.
The continuing, integrated growth of the company offers
engineers an assured future of leadership.
How is the company doing right now? Let's look at one

trusion of rivet heads, better air seals, and
greater fatigue limit. (6, 7, 17)
The literature contains no references to
the comparative strength between welded
and adhesive bonded structures, prob-
ably because completely welded struc-
tures are stronger. However, the use of
adhesive has some advantages in other re-
spects over the use of welding. Corrosion
due to galvanic action between dissimilar
metals and residual stress from welding
are avoided by using adhesives (7)
To outline only the advantages of ad-
hesive bonding would at least be unfair,
if not dangerous. Adhesive bonded joints
fail just as other types of joints fail unoer
excessive loads and at excessively high
temperatures. And as with other methods
of joining, the actual value of the ulti-
mate load is not a static figure, but one
that varies with temperature and with the
bonding technique. Also, since adhe-
sives are sometimes mixtures of low
miscibility, under stress the low mole-
cular weight fraction may "bleed," caus-
ing phase changes and decreases in joint
strength. (18, 19)
In adhesive bonding of metals, the ad-
hesive is not the only factor to receive
consideration. Proper structure and point
design is essential to achieve maximum
properties. And many times the engineer
is not restricted to one metal. In general,
high valency metals bond better than low
valency metals. But even more important
in determining the strength of the bond
is the atomic volume of the metal, as
shown in Table 3. (1, 11, 12)

the Metal and the Bonded Strength of a

Lastly after all necessary property re-
quirements have been met, the final de-
cision to use adhesive bonding must be
made on a cost basis. Small assemblies
cannot be bonded with adhesives as in-
expensively as they can be brazed or
welded. Furthermore, if production is
low, since the initial cost is high for the
special equipment found in most plants,
brazing or welding is more economical.
(7) But in high production situations,
when the capital investment can be spread
over many units, the unit (average) cost
is very low. Resin blends cost from $1.00
to $4.00 per pound in 1000 pound lots,
but if the fabricator can mix his own
adhesive—which permits him to formu-
late the adhesive to his own needs—he
can purchase "pure" resins from $.25
to $.75 per pound in 1000 pound lots.
Another cost advantage of adhesive bond-
ing is the fact that maintainance and re-
placement costs are negligibly low in
comparison with other methods. (6, 20)

JOB FACTS FROM DU PONT
YOUR INTERESTS, SPECIAL ABILITIES ARE IMPORTANT
WHEN DU PONT MAKES YOUR FIRST JOB ASSIGNMENT
ROOM TO GROW
There's plenty of room to grow
at DuPont. One reason is that
the very diversity of our products
and processes requires specialists
in almost every area of science
and engineering. Another reason
is that DuPont continues to ex-
pand in many new directions.
For example, in 1957 sales
reached $2 billion. Four new
plants were being built. New re-
search projects were launched,
new products marketed.
In 1957, too, new technical
men joined DuPont in chemical,
civil, mechanical, metallurgical,
electrical, industrial, petroleum

and mining engineering; in
atomic energy, instrumentation,
chemistry, physics, mathematics
and many other fields.
All this activity points to as
bright a future today as ever be-
fore in our long history. There's
a place for the good graduate in
this picture. If you would like
more specific information on op-
portunities at Du Pont, we invite
you to sign up for a Du Pont
interview with your placement
director.
DU PONT SUMMER JOB
GIVES YOU A CHANCE
TO EARN AND LEARN
DuPont offers college juniors and
qualified sophomores in technical
fields the opportunity to earn college
expense money this summer while
they learn more about the kind of
work that will be open to them when
they graduate.
The Company has 75 plants and 98
laboratories located across 26 states
—a spread that often gives the student
a chance to work in or near his own
section of the country. Some of these
locations have openings for summer
employment in 1958.
Students work side by side with
practicing engineers and scientists. In
this way they gain valuable experience
to supplement classroom theory.
Last year, 407 students from 113
colleges took advantage of this pro-
gram. Du Pont pays round-trip trans-
portation expenses from home or
school to place of employment. Stu-
dents are not obligated to continue
with the Company after graduation.
For complete details on this pro-
gram, check with your college place-
ment director.
SEND FOR INFORMATION BOOKLET
Booklets on jobs at Du Pont are yours
for the asking. Subjects include: me-
chanical, civil, metallurgical, chemical,
electrical, instrumentation and indus-
trial engineers; atomic energy, technical
sales, business administration, research
and development. Name the subject that
interests you in letter to Du Pont, 2494-E
INemours Building, Wilmington 98, Del.
Personalized Training
Relates to Policy of
Promotion from Within
Where do your interests lie? What
courses have you taken? What are
your special abilities? Du Pont tries
to match these factors with available
jobs to determine your first job as-
signment within the Company.
Once the assignment is made, the
Company helps you apply your knowl-
edge to a problem right away. You
learn by doing—in consultation with
your supervisor and others working
on various phases of the same project.
Your performance on the job is evalu-
ated periodically, so you always know
where you stand in the eyes of your
management.
As you might guess, Du Pont's per-
sonalized training is closely related
to its promotion policy. Almost all
advancement is made from within the
Company, so if your supervision has
indicated that you are ready for pro-
motion, and an opening occurs for
which your training has prepared
you, you are sure to be considered.
Although Du Pont employs about
90,000 people, management authority
is decentralized through many depart-
ments into small groups—small enough
so that the new man's capabilities can
be recognized quickly. This type of
organization, plus the Company's
steady growth, produces many oppor-
tunities for the new man.
Du Pont, over the past 25 years, has
spent $1 on research for every $3 on
production facilities.

Dean Stephen S. Attwood was born in 1897 in
Cleveland, Ohio. He graduated from Cleveland
West Technical High School in 1914. He came to
the University of Michigan to receive his B.S
degree in Mechanical Engineering in 1918 and his
M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering in 1923. He
has assumed the position of Dean of Engineering
at Michigan since the death of Dean Brown last
year.
In addition to his professional affiliations, he is
a member of Tau Beta Pi, Sigma Xi, and Eta
Kappa Nu. He has been associated with the Elec-
trical Engineering Department since 1920 and has
had research and industrial experience with numer-
ous universities and companies.
cal expressions. These are then applied to new problem. As be
has progressed, therefore, his reliance on mathematics has
grown. This is particularly true in those fields in which he
has advanced far beyond the frontiers of past experience.
The modern engineer is generally a member of a team, for
teams have been found to be more effective than individuals
working alone. As a result, it is all the more important that
the engineer be able to convey his ideas and plans to those
with whom he associates. He does so through mathematics,
drawing and English. Then too, industry has found that
engineers make good administrators, and calls upon them to
manage men as well as materials and processes. Here again,
the engineer must have the ability to express ideas clearly,
concisely and effectively.
Here at The University of Michigan, we also believe the
engineering student should have a firm grasp on the funda-
mental principles of science, for they underlie all our fields of
engineering.
A survey of the men with the General Electric company
who hold engineering degrees has shown that 83 per cent of
them are working in fields other than the one in which they
trained. This is a growing trend, so that today we find that,
shortly after graduation, most engineers are given assignments
without regard to their college specialization. To fulfill these
assignments, they turn to basic scientific principles for guid-
ance.
The extremely rapid technological advances of the past 15
years have also served to make today's "practical applications"
obsolete tomorrow. All these things have combined to place
greater emphasis on a broader "scientific engineering" educa-
tion.
It is true that there will long be need for engineers who
can lay out roads, operate petroleum refineries, design ma-
chinery and handle other important technical jobs. But the
critical demand in the immediate future is for engineers with
above average ability who can do things which have never
been done before: convert nuclear energy directly into electri-
cal power, utilize efficiently the sun's radiation, develop ma-
terials to withstand tremendous temperatures and pressures,
formulate in mathematical language problems that can be
handled by electronic computers.
There appears to be no end of opportunities for the engi-
neering student, and certainly a wide range of challenges.

Weapons Systems Responsibility
In the development of guided missile
systems, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
maintains a complete and broad respon-
sibility. From the earliest conception to
production engineering—from research
and development in electronics, guidance,
aerodynamics, structures and propulsion,
through field testing problems and actual
troop use, full technical responsibility rests
with JPL engineers and scientists.
The Laboratory is not only responsible for
the missile system itself, including guid-
ance, propulsion and airframe, but for all
ground handling equipment necessary to
insure a complete tactical weapons system.
One outstanding product of this type of
systems responsibility is the "Corporal,"
a highly accurate surface-to-surface ballis-
tic missile. This weapon, developed by J PL,
and now in production elsewhere, can be
found "on active service" wherever needed
in the American defense pattern.
A prime attraction for scientists and
engineers at JPL is the exceptional oppor-
tunity provided for original research
afforded by close integration with vital and
forward-looking programs. The Laboratory
now has important positions open for
qualified applicants for such interesting
and challenging activities.

meteorology: the Colleges of Engineer-
ing, Architecture, Natural Resources,
Medicine, and Public Health all encounter
meteorological problems and conduct co-
operative research programs for solutions.
In the past, University meteorological
education has concentrated mostly on
theory or weather forecasting. The Michi-
gan program is the first to emphasize not
only a sound background in the funda-
mentals of meteorology but also its many
applications as well. It appeals particu-
larly to those of scientific bent with ini-
tiative and imagination who welcome the
challenging opportunities of a new and
rapidly developing field.
Presently, both the M.S. and Ph.D. in
Meteorology are offered, but not the
B.S. It is recommended that those inter-
ested in a career in this rapidly develop-
ing field obtain a thorough background
in mathematics and physics in their under-
graduate program. A B.S. degree is being
considered and may be established in
the near future.
Besides students studying for advanced
degrees with specialties in applied meteor-
ology, there are programs for air pol-
lution specialists which are combined
with other departmental studies and there-
is also a group of Air Force students

sive field studies. Additional space and
equipment arc being provided in the
Fluids Engineering Laboratory now under
construction, and a mobile weather radar
facility will become part of the research
equipment in the near future.
Research programs now being conduct-
ed under the Engineering Research In-
stitute include studies in air pollution,
dynamic wind loading of structures, the
dispersion of ragweed pollen, the meteor-
ology of the Great Lakes, snow research
and military problems. These programs
are carried on jointly with staff members
of such departments as Environmental
Health, Internal Medicine, Botany, Zo-
ology, other engineering departments, the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and in-
clude contracts from several government
agencies. Other programs are planned in
connection with highway engineering and
weather radar. A national conference on
problems of engineering meteorology will
be held at the University in September,
1958. Forecasting can be an important
part of applied meteorology based on the
relationships between the weather and i
particular operation. The forecasting for
graduation exercises was mentioned in the
introduction. At graduation time of year,
there is a good chance of showers which
can result in a last minute change ot
plans to an indoor environment with some
difficulty and loss of ceremony. The Uni-
versity of Michigan radar was pressed into
service in connection with last year's exer-
cises in order to give an accurate short
term forecast of the weather conditions
for the afternoon. The weather radar
will give a continuous and instantaneous
picture of all significant cloud formations
within a 200 mile radius. Thus by fol-
lowing the development and movement
of shower-producing clouds, it could be
determined in sufficient time that no
showers would dampen the exercises
Weather radar has wide applications in
meteorology extending from making
basic investigations of the physics of
clouds to the short range warning of the
threat of a tornado. It is but one example
of the many techniques utilized in study-
ing atmospheric processes and applying
this knowledge to the solving of meteor-
ology.

FROM CLASSROOM
TO PLANT
More than one broad step awaits every engi-
neer who steps out of his cap and robe of grda-
uation into the working clothes of his profes-
sion.
What is the nature of an engineering
education? Among educators few
topics excite such a clash of opinions.
The same variety of attitudes exists among
businessmen in their expectations of col-
lege-trained engineers. Yet both educa-
tors and industrialists share a mutual ap-
preciation of the most desirable qualities
of the newly graduated bachelor of sci-
ence. The young engineer should be of
immediate utility, be able successfully to
perform specific business or technical
functions with assurance and speed. He
should exhibit the capacity for growth,
which is an ability to maintain and im-
prove his technical competence while re-
lating his contributions to those of the
rest of society. More intangible, perhaps,
but of increasing necessity, he should have
working knowledge of the world of
ideas and relate it significently to the
specific job problem at hand. Part of the
prescription for the cure of the perils of
the Age of Anxiety and the increasing
technological demands of society is that
we educate men and women who, in ad-
dition to specialized competence, have a
responsive and informed awareness of
human values extending far beyond the
limitations of mere techniques.
There is a spreading conviction among
educators that the engineering curriculum
must loosen its classical compartmentali-
zation in favor of experimentation and
innovation. The current plans call for
deepening the content of science with
more emphasis on the fundamental as-
pects of engineering, thus deferring spe-
cialization until the last two years of
undergraduate training. Perhaps a more
drastic measure favors pushing real spe-
cialization into the graduate years or into
the in-service training by industry. These
innovations are not merely for the sake ot
change, but a genuine effort to develop
engineers of more depth, power, and
versatility and to terminate the mass pro-
duction of slickly veneered technicians.
There is little doubt that any pro-
gram which would produce men of vision
would be heartily welcomed by industry.
Would such a man be immediately use-
ful? Could an engineer with but four
years of undergraduate training along
such lines successfully cope with day-by-
day engineering problems of the produc-
tion floor and the laboratory? Experience
has proved that the answer is yes. How-
ever, there is a need for more "learning
by doing," an interdependence between
the theoretical and the practical, between
the lecture room and the laboratory. The
questions, "Why does it work?" and
"Why does it happen?" are discussed in
the lecture room; the questions of "How
does it work?" and "How does it hip-
pen?" are answered in the laboratory,
where students themselves construct prac-
tical application of the theory and watch
it work. Students can gain firsthand
knowledge of industry and "learn by do-
ing" through availing themselves of co-
operative training programs, industrial
plant visit, practice schools, and summer
work opportunities. With such prepara-
tion, the newly graduated engineer can
confidently face the technical challenge*
which his first job will present.
Colleges today, as a rule, seem to pre-
pare their students efficiently for the
technical demands of industry. But arc the
graduating seniors alerted to psychologi-

Looking for a solid, satisfying career
with a vigorous company in a grow-

Company, Louisville, Kentucky —
world's largest manufacturer of air
filters, dust control and heating and
ventilating equipment — needs gradu-
ate engineers to fill responsible jobs in
sales, engineering and production in
its 125 field offices and nine manu-
facturing plants located in six cities.
In July of 1958, AAF will inaugurate
its next five-month technical training
course for a select group of engineer-
ing graduates. This full-time program
combines classroom work, under the
direction of competent instructors, with
field trips to both company plants and
large industrial users of AAF products.

cal differences between campus and fac-
tory? Are they readily able to effect the
necessary adjustment? The answer, of
course, depends upon the individual. The
college aims to provide an atmosphere
congenial to the development of indi-
viduality so that a graduate can cope with
a changing environment. Yet experience
shows that the first job will cause the new
engineer to do considerable soul-searching
after reporting for work, despite all the
advice and counsel given to the graduat-
ing classes by placement officers, profes-
sors, friends, and industrial leaders. In
nearly all cases he will be too impatient
for success and promotion and to make
immediate utilization of his education.
The first and greatest readjustment
necessary for the new engineer is to ac-
cept himself as a member of a huge, and
to him impersonal, business organization.
Which of us has not experienced the same
feeling viewing the vast expanse of cars
in a company parking lot? Your car is
that green '56 Ford in the middle, sur-
rounded by several hundred others. Lost
in a host of ciphers, we are without con-
viction of our own uniqueness.
To a certain extent this feeling of the
loss of individuality depends upon the
type of work engaging the new engineer".
If he is doing research and development,
he finds himself more quickly than do his
classmates in sales, manufacturing, or pro-
duction operations. The former groups
are smaller in size and new employees are
in close contact with the supervisors.
Does this mean that colleges have over-
protected their boys? In defense of the
new engineer, it must be recalled that as
a student he formed close ties with his
college community. His classmates, teach-
ers, and college officials were, probably,
openly interested in him. He knew the
campus gossip and most of his colleagues.
The process of recognizing mutuality
with a college community is a speedier
one than with industry. But within a
longer time span a similar mutuality and
fellowship evolves with his employer.
Another complicating factor for the
recent engineering graduate is the mis-
leading conception of self-importance he
often acquires during his senior year in
college. Industrial representatives have
been openly wooing him regarding em-
ployment. Newspapers and magazines are
filled with help-wanted advertisements. Ir.
some instances a "red carpet" treatment
has been accorded him while on plant
visits. He is temporarily discouraged
when the plant manager with whom he
had lunch two months ago passes him in
the hall without the slightest nod or
recognition.
The new engineer is further startled bv
disregard for individual initiative and
ideas, especially in the larger and more
established firms. As a student he wis
encouraged to criticize openly various
ways of solving engineering problems,
eventually leading to the "best" way to
carry on business or technical operations.
On the first job, in all probability, he dis-
covers many things done quite difTerendy
than the ideal method listed in the text-
books. Too often the perfectly valid
reasons for the company's policy are not
explained to the new employee. As he in-
tegrates his understanding of industry
in relation to himself, a young engineer
will bring new appreciation to the deli-
cate balance between his fresh ideas and
time-honored processes.
A minor and thankfully short-lived
discouragement for the new engineer is
the common practice of industry of as-
signing the neophyte employee to one
routine task, rather than affording him a
variety of experience. The consequent re-
sult is a doubt whether this particular
firm is providing a suitable challenge to
one with his training. It is a hard lesson
to learn that responsibility and the more
important assignments are, as a rule, not
given until the new engineer has proved
himself.
Industry is well aware of these various
psychological problems which plague the
new employee. Steps are taken for their
alleviation, notably closer supervision,
more personal contact, and the periodic
review of performance. Many organiza-
tions feel that a training program of from
six to twelve months duration is a neces-
sity for all new employees as a way of
indoctrination. But industrialist and edu-
cator alike are aware that these are merely
devices. In the final analysis it is the indi-
vidual who must acclimate himself to his
new environment.

makes big things happen
in paints and
industrial finishes
You're living in a world of color. Man takes a brush, dips it into paint,
cloaks the drab with new cheerfulness, converts the dreary into com-
pelling beauty. But paint means so much more than mere color.
In addition to soft, pastel hues, home owners in Miami want a house
paint that stands up to constant salt air breezes, the blazing rays of a
tropic sun, intermittent heavy rainfall. Building superintendents in Gary
want a surface coating unaffected by chemically active industrial gases
and fumes, extremes in humidity, frequent changes in wind direction.
Fishing fleet operators around Puget Sound want an exterior boat finish
that resists biting winds, blizzards and protracted cold. The production
engineer in a large Atlanta cannery wants a food container coating
impervious to chemical reaction, yet taste-free. Yes, there's more—
much more—to paint than mere color.
The search for new and even better paints and industrial finishes is
carried on every day at Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company. Each day

In this month's Technic we have some-
thing just a little different than the usual
in puzzles. The number of illustrations
scattered about the page may well be
termed "where did it go." Look carefully
and see if you can discover how we ap-
parently create and destroy matter! Don't
fret too much though; an attempt at an
explanation appears on the answer page.

Just to break the monotony we have
also interjected our traditional type teas-
ers between the picture puzzles. Try this
one as a mental tuneup for what is com-
ing:
The inhabitants of a certain remote is-
land are divided into two hereditary
castes. To an outsider the members of
these two castes look entirely alike. But
those in one caste, the Arbus, always tell
the truth; those in the other, the Bosnins,
always tell the opposite of the truth.
To this island came an explorer who
knew something of their customs, but
little of their language. As he landed he
met three natives—Abl, Bsl, and Crl.
"Of what caste are you?" the explorer
asked Abl.
"Bhsz cjnt dkpv flgqw mrx," said Abl.
"What did he say?" asked the explorer,
addressing Bsl and Crl, both of whom
had learned some English.
"He say he Arbu," said Bsl."
"He say he Bosnin," said Crl.
To which castes do Bsl and Crl belong?
The second of our verbal problems
should provide a means of frustrating the
chess experts, what think you, a second
rater, because, just as the little girl in our
problem, you too can beat the experts.
I have a friend who is an ardent
chess player, yet his twelve year old
daughter scarcely knows the moves. Re-
cently two of his friends, who are chess
experts, came to dinner. After dinner he
played one game with each of them and
lost both games. Just as he finished his
daughter came into the room. On learning
of his ill success she said, "Daddy, I'm
ashamed of you. I can do better than that.
Let me play them! I don't want any ad-
vantage—I'll play one game with white
pieces and one with black. (In chess, the
white pieces always move first.) And I'll
give them an advantage by playing both
games at once. Still, I shall make out
better than you did."
We took her up immediately on this.
To the amazement of all she made good.
How did she do it?
Here is a problem that is relatively
simple but our attempt to make it simpler
than it really is gives us a wrong solu-
tion.
For their common meal Caius provided
7 dishes and Sempronius 8. But Titus
arrived unexpected, so all shared the food
equally. Titus paid Caius 14 denarii and
Sempronius 16. The latter cried out
against the division, and the matter was
referred to a judge. What should his
decision be, granting that the 30 denarii
is the correct total amount.
For a relief we give you this problem
with the answer in it:
In a certain bitterly fought war one
side summarily executed all prisoners sus-
pected of sniping. But first the execu-
tioners amused themselves by asking each
condemned man, "How are you to be
killed, by shooting or by hanging? If you
answer correctly you will be shot. If not.
you will be hanged." Most of the pris-
oners were too distraught to sense the
trick, but one, thinking to save himself,
boldly replied, "By hanging.*' If the
executioners had tried to keep their word
they would have been in a pretty quan-
dary. But needless to say they shot him
anyway.

and equally
important,
are you going to
get somewhere?
Perhaps you have heard some classmate say, almost complacently,
"Times have changed."
With many branches of industry today openly competing for good
science and engineering graduates, who can blame the young graduate-to-be
for feeling supremely confident. You know you can get a job,
know that salaries are high and are fully aware that
men with technical backgrounds are moving up to administrative
positions in ever-increasing numbers.
Nevertheless, in many respects, times have not changed at all.
That "first job" is every bit as important today as it was five, ten, twenty
years ago. Starting salaries remain only one of many factors to be
considered. And a man's future is still necessarily linked to the future
of the company for which he works. Moreover, a thoughtful examination
of such matters as potential growth, challenge, advancement policy,
facilities, degree of self-direction, permanence, benefits and the like often
indicates that real opportunity still does not grow on trees.

directive antenna each time it is reflected
during the brief life of an ionized meteor
trail, and the information is fed to a
cathode-ray tube for display on a viewing
screen. In the experimental system, photo-
graphic techniques are used to record the
image as it appears on the screen.
The research team reported that the
scanner and transmitter are run continu-
ously, sending copies of a picture over
and over at the rate of two complete
scans each second. The receiver is also on
continuously with the recording unit in a
"standby condition."
"When a passing meteor closes the
transmission path, the incoming signals
trips the recorder ... to permit reproduc-
tion on the phosphor screen," they said.
"The circuit then resets for the next
burst."
The report stated that the experimental
transmitter produces 20 kilowatts of
power at a frequency of 40 mega-
cycles, which is in the very-high-fre-
quency range somewhat below the portion
of the frequency spectrum used for com-
merical VHF television service. It added
that the "encouraging results" so far
have been achieved during preliminary
tests of the new equipment prior to the
start of a planned research program.
X-Rays Among Latest Police
Identification Techniques
Cigarettes found at the scene of a crime
can be identified and can lead to a crim-
inal, not only by Sherlock Holmes' time-
tested brand-identification method, but by
determining paper characteristics through
"soft" x-ray analysis.
This was one of the techniques revealed
to law enforcement officers studying lat-
est photographic methods of crime de-
tection at a seminar held last week at
Eastman Kodak Company.
Harris B. Tuttle, Kodak's law enforce-
ment photography consultant, said the
seminar covered crime analysis informa-
tion gathered in preceeding months in
such rapidly developing fields as photo-
micrography, radiological identification,
and infra-red photography.
From exhibits at the seminar, it is clear
that magazine detective heroes are fre-
quently outdone by their real-life counter-
parts using modern scientific methods.
X-ray photography can determine the
path taken by an embedded slug, when
extraction might affect the evidence. The
lead from any calibre shell shows up ex-
cellently in an x-ray.
X-ray can also provide police with a
double-edged tool against dope peddlers.
With the x-ray technique, the amount of
marijuana in a confiscated cigarette can be
determined without destroying the evi-
dence through chemical analysis. Police
then have conclusive proof of the orig-
inal content of the cigarette plus the final
evidence from chemical analysis.
Photomicrography has also become im-
portant in law enforcement in recent
years. Even single human hairs or cloth-
ing fibers can be positively identified.
By the refinement of color photography,
the range of usefulness of this tool in
comparing evidence is increased.
Microscopic pieces of paint can be
fitted together like pieces in a jig-saw
puzzle, and the match photographed to
provide conclusive evidence in a hit-run
case.
If such matching is not possible, a
spectroscopic analysis can be made of
paint found at the scene of the crime and
compared with the spectroscopic curves
of paint taken from a suspected vehicle.
One of the latest developments is the
Ektron detector burglar alarm. This device
will set off a remote alarm when some-
one passes through its invisible beam of
infra-red radiation.
An alarm of this type can snap an in-
truder's picture using a flashbulb masked
so that only invisible intra-red radiation
reaches the subject and exposes the film.
Many a thief has unknowingly posed for
his portrait in front of such a device.
Tuttle pointed out.
Photography can be used to advantage
in detecting counterfeit bills. Radiographs
provide the greatest assistance. A genuine
bill will give a clear portrait, when pho-
tographed with low voltage x-rays. A
counterfeit bill will usually appear with-
out detail.

ANSWERS TO
TECHNIC TEASERS
(p. 66)
The answer to the illustrated problems is perhaps most
simply presented with the aid of a similar problem which is
more easily visualized.
The checkerboard on the left is cut along the diagonal line.
Part B is then shifted downward as shown on the right. If
the projecting triangle at the upper right corner is snipped
off and fitted into the triangular spice at the lower left, a
rectangle of 7 by 9 units will be formed. The original square
had an area of 64 square units. Now we have an area of 63-
The answer lies in the fact that the diagonal line passes
slightly below the lower left corner of the square at the upper
right corner of the checkerboard. This gives the snipped-off
triangle an altitude of 1 1/7 rather than 1, and gives the
entire rectangle a height of 9 1/7 units. The addition of
1/7 of a unit to the height is not noticeable, but when it is
taken into account, the rectangle will have the expected area
of 64 square units.
The other problems are based on a similar principle ot
"Concealed Distribution."
The solution to the first teaser depends on the fact that
every native, whether an Arbu or a Bosnin, must always reply
to a question about his caste by saying that he is an Arbu. If
he is an Arbu he will speak the truth and say so; if he is
not he will lie and say that he is. Thus Bsl is an Arbu for
reporting Abl's statement correctly.
Solution 2 is almost as simple. Let us call the experts Mr.
White and Mr. Black, according to the color of the pieces
each played against the daughter. Mr. White played first. The
daughter copied his first move as her opening against Mr-
Black at the other board. When Mr. Black had answered this
move, she copied his move at the first board as her reply to
Mr. White. And so on. In this way the simultaneous games
against the two experts became a single game between them;
the daughter served as a messenger to transmit the moves
Hence she was certain that she would either win one game ind
lose one, or draw both.
The judges awarded 12 denarii to Caius and 18 to Sem-
pronius.

It was considered a bold stroke, in Nathaniel Jenkins'day, to fix one's
mark or name to the product of his invention. In 1864, product quality
control was largely a matter of good intent and determination on the
part of the maker. Nathaniel Jenkins had that determination and, as evi-
dence of it, put his Diamond mark and signature on every Jenkins Valve.
Over the years, many new and different types of valves have joined the
Jenkins Valve family. And because the rigid, quality specifications set
by the founder have never been compromised, the Jenkins Diamond
trade-mark has steadily gained in value.
Indeed, to buyers and specifiers of valves everywhere, this mark has
become a trusted symbol of efficient, economical valve performance.

Steel nest that hatched a smoother transmission
YOU'RE looking at a ring
gear "nesting" three small-
er gears. It's part of one of the
smoothest shifting transmis-
sions ever put in a car. But it was
almost too expensive to build.
Getting this extra smoothness
called for squeezing more gears
into the same size transmission
case. Nesting was necessary to
save space. And the big ring
gear had to be extra tough. The
problem was to make it eco-
nomically.
The manufacturer turned to
Timken Company metallurgists
—acknowledged experts in fine
alloy steels. They showed how
to save the cost of boring out
each gear—by starting with
Timken® seamless steel tubing.
The hole's already there. And

needs. It's another example
of how Timken Company

Learn now that society will provide for you. Just because you are you. Just because
you are paying for an education doesn't mean you have to get your money's worth.
Don't be ridiculous. "If the learner hasn't learned," it isn't your fault, surely.
1. GENERAL ATTITUDE—The B.B.A. degree' is valuable. Successful grads have made
it so. It is valuable because they produced. Let them keep up the good work, but don't
prepare to rob them of their glory, to increase the value.
2. BE YOUTHFUL—Be young while you can. Why discard those good old high school
days—and ways? Don't grow up until you just have to. People will always be under-
standing and appreciative of your adolescence.
3. DRESS—Be yourself, dress naturally. Those business people can be very stuffy
about sartorial matters. On that first job, they'll probably start you off as a porter any-
way, so' why not look like one?
4. AROMATICS—The pungency of the locker room can be carried with you. A gamey
"athletic" odor is a great personal asset—in class and out, in business and out—and
fast. Carry your own atmosphere—be "aromatic."
5. RELAX, ENJOY IT—A stiff posture restricts absorption. Spread yourself figura-
tively. Chairs in front, occupied or not, are fine for parking feet, thus facilitating relaxation.
6. MENTAL EFFORT—Some say that brain cells, like liquor bottles, can not be used
twice. Save them, coddle them, spare them—in class and out. The mind(?) you save
may be your own.
7. DON'T ANTICIPATE—Who knows what might happen tomorrow—or for that matter
next week, when the paper is due? Don't do it ahead of time—nothing might happen.
Then you'd have no excuse.
8. ACCURACY—Is for the birds. A misplaced decimal point is embarrassing but not
critical. You can always do it right when and if you get a job (on the basis of your ex-
cellent school record, of course).
9. DON'T WRITE, TELEGRAPH—Legibility went out with long underwear. None of the
really big wheels like Napoleon, Hitler, or even Confucius—could write good English.
10. SPELLING—Why bring that up? Phonetics are out, "word picture" didn't work, so
your generation just can't spell. Everyone understands and is so sorry. You are unique
—now don't go and spoil it.
11. LATE PAPERS—Promptness here is a sign of servility. Be independent. Be different.
A few days late shouldn't matter, especially if you use a good standard explanation.
12. BE LATE—A "fashionable" entrance, after everyone else is seated, and the class
is moving along—this calls attention to one, definitely. You can also be so ignorant
about what has gone before and get the spotlight again.
13. ATTEND IRREGULARLY—That's the stuff. Always being there is dreadfully bor-
ing. After all, one meeting is like another and the instructor gets tired of your face, too.
14. BE CONVERSATIONAL—Talk it up. If the old buzzard doesn't make it interesting,
it surely can't be interesting to your neighbor, can it? Competition is good for business,
so why not for business educators?
15. PREPARATION—A dangerous habit. Here again, let's don't anticipate. A heavy
snow might make the work useless. And—the instructor might resent having you come to
class one day knowing what he is talking about.
16. (BUT OTHERWISE) CLAM UP—Don't ever venture an opinion, don't defend a
point; let some other jerk stick his neck out. Remember it may be better to remain silent
and be thought ignorant—than to open one's mouth and remove all doubt.
17. ON YOUR MARK—Don't get left at the post when the bell rings. A rustling of
papers and plopping of books indicates alertness on your part to the hour of parting and
reminds the Professor accordingly.
18. REPETITION—A powerful force. If the files show that someone did a good paper
on the topic last year, why should such a gem be discarded? The instructor will never
recognize it if your pal was at MSU.
19. PLAGIARISM—If in preparing a paper you find that some author has said it
better than you can; and a long time ago—don't dull initiative. Let him have his way—
in your paper, too. It should be flattering to him.

The structure of a coal molecule is
believed to be of the type shown
here. Atoms of oxygen, carbon, nitro-
gen, hydrogen, and sulfur are repre-
sented by the variously shaded balls.
Here's the alma mater
of 200,000 successful grads
More than 1900 chemicals have
been found in coal, and over 200,000
different products are made from
them—products like plastics, syn-
thetic rubber, synthetic fibers, and
resins. There's still more to come.
Only a fraction of the 1900 chemicals
in coal are currently used commer-
cially.
Today, United States Steel and
other producers of coal chemicals
continue to study coal, its structure,
and its future potential as a source
of basic chemicals.
Why, you may ask, are we so in-
terested in chemicals when our prin-
cipal business is steel? The reason is
that it's just good business. In pro-
ducing coke for our steel-making
operations, we also produce chemi-
cals. Thus we are always interested
in anything, and anybody, that will
help to advance the technology of
these related products, improve their
quality, and in general reduce the
over-all cost of manufacture and pro-
vide better products and better serv-
ice for our customers.
It's a big job and we need a lot of
good people to do it—physicists,
chemists, geologists, all kinds of en-
gineers—people with your training.

surface for ore, delve into the com-
mercial use of coal chemicals, help

Modem chemistry is creating exciting new
horizons that challenge the inventive
minds of both scientist and student. Prod
uct synthesis, by bold adaptation of natura
resources to our way of life, has pushed
the frontiers of chemistry far beyond its
early promises.
As the chemical industry forges ahead,
inventing new processes and producing
new materials which assure the progress
and comfort of our society, research and
development soar to new heights. Imagina-
tive exploration advances under chemists
and chemical engineers. New and greater
production facilities are created. Many
more engineers of all kinds tackle the com-
plex tasks of building new plants or de-
signing new processes to expand and per-
fect the many operations of this ever-
growing industry.
Yes, today's chemistry is a fascinating
world. Filled with exciting accomplish-
ments and possibilities, it attracts young
men and women of vision who will give
the industry the inspiring leadership of
tomorrow.

Lounge in Comfort
At the beginning of the semester, the doors were opened to
the Undergraduate Library, located where the West Engineering
Annex had stood for some seventy years. With its opening, the
libraries of East and West Engineering Buildings closed and were
transferred to the third floor of the new library, which, incidentally
(actually not so incidentally), is one of the finest and most complete
of its kind anywhere. Our attention focuses, however, on the con-
struction noises now heard where the stillness of libraries once ruled
supreme. Construction for two classrooms and offices, badly needed,
goes on in East Engineering Building, but our main interest lies
across the street, where workmen are preparing the new student
lounge for the Engineering College.
Much has been said and written during the past fifty years
about the need for a student lounge, where engineering students
might mix knowledge with an informal (perhaps smoke-filled) at-
mosphere. The Technic has contributed probably more than its
share of anguish and worry on this subject to the Dean and his
faculty, with articles and editorials far back toward the nineteenth
century, so it would not be fair to repeat all the reasons behind
these pleas for the lounge. They are self-evident.
But, it is the duty of the Technic to offer to the administration
of the Engineering College on behalf of our readers, the students,
a very sincere, "Thank You," for your answer to many past pleas.
We hope the students will find the enjoyment in the lounge that
both the faculty and the student body have desired for so long a
time.
Again, a hearty thanks.

New
Radio Telescope
Michigan's new telescope, by ROGER BARNES, '60E
when completed this summer,
will be the second largest in the
world.
This 85-foot-wide ear for listen-
ing to radio signals from our uni-
verse and remote heavenly sources
will be built this spring at the
University of Michigan with funds
provided by the Office of Naval
Research. Second largest steerable
radio telescope in the world, the
precision instrument will follow the
sun by day and tune in on the
universe by night.
Peach Mountain, sixteen miles from
Ann Arbor, will be the scene of in-
creased activity come next June, for
that is the date set for the construction
of the University of Michigan's giant
radio telescope that will serve to increase
man's knowledge of the universe. An 85
foot solid aluminum reflector will be part
of the second largest steerable telescope
in the world as well as one of the most
precisely made. Upon its completion, the
telescope can automatically follow the
sun across the sky by day and penetrate
the far reaches of interstellar space by
night, continually recording radio waves
that radiate from these sources.
Specifications for the highly sensitive
instrument were drawn up by Fred T.
Haddock, associate professor of astron-
omy, and electrical engineering. Standing
over 100 feet high, the telescope will re-
quire 160 tons of steel and aluminum
and 50 tons of lead counterweight. Two
hundred fifty cubic yards of concrete
foundation will enable the telescope to
be operated in winds up to 45 miles per
hour and withstand windstorms of 120
miles per hour. A declination gear and
an hour angle gear together will be capa-
ble of being controlled automatically so
that the telescope can focus on its target
for long periods of time without straying
due to the earth's rotation. In all, the
facility will cost about $300,000, with the
greater part to be financed by the Office
of Naval Research.
A radio telescope such as the proposed
University one is the optical telescope's
counterpart, but detects electromagnetic
radiation rather than visible light wave-
lengths. Its sensitivity depends largely
upon the type and shape of the antenna.
A dish-shaped, parabolic reflector, made
either of a solid such as aluminum or
wine screen, is the most widely used type.
So perfect will be the antenna of the new
University telescope that its solid alum-
inum surface will not vary more than a
quarter of an inch from a true parabolo
and will prevent the leakage of signals
at all wavelengths. Located at the focal
point of the parabolic reflector is a small
dipole to which the signals are directed.
From there the signals are converted into
varying electrical energy which, in turn,
will be graphed.
Radiation from Interstellar Space
Radio astronomy had its beginning in
the United States when Karl G. Jansky,
a Bell Telephone Company engineer, first
detected radio waves of extraterrestrial
origin in 1932. These signals were found
to be produced by the interaction of elec-
trons with atomic particles or with mag-
netic fields, and to yield information about
the regions in which they originate. Un-
like light, radio waves can penetrate the
clouds, haze of the earth's atmosphere
and the vast dust clouds of interstellar
space, and be detected by a radio tele-
scope without absorbtion. The new dis-
covery of these radio waves was indeed

A spiral galaxy in the Big Dipper,
which astronomers believe to look very
much like the one in which our sea-
system is located.
significant, and within a short time, as-
tronomers had before them a completely
new picture of our galaxy, thoroughly
mapped, and yielding far greater knowl-
edge than visual telescopes could pro-
duce.
With the development of larger and
more precise radio telescopes, astronom-
ers soon became aware of two variefies
of sources in interstellar space that
"broadcast" radio waves. The first was
associated with relatively motionless hy-
drogen gas which composed the major
part of matter in space and 10% of the
Milky Way. It is easily detected as a
steady humming note at a frequency of
1420 megacycles. So concentrated is this
neutral hydrogen in our galaxy that the
shape and extent of its spiral arms have
been traced out in detail from the graphs
of the radio signals. In a like manner,
the graphs also revealed the amount of
the gas along a particular line-of-sight.
Although this first variety of interstellar
radio sources is invaluable in the mapping
of the galaxy, it is the second source
variety that is more remarkable. This
second radio source, which is very dis-
tinct, appears to be associated with highly
turbulent gas masses. Although they
seldom correspond with optically known
objects in the sky, several outstanding
ones have been definitely linked with
two types of interstellar occurrences.
Supernovae Linked with Radio Sources
The first type of occurrence from which
intense radiation has been detected is the
three known supernovae, or stellar ex-
plosions. For example, the third most
intense radio source in the sky coincides
in position and size to a supernova that
occurred in 1054. Likewise, the position
of the 1572 supernova is now occupied
by a radio source. Radiation has also
been detected from the remains of the
third great stellar explosion, though, as
yet, no radio telescope of any size has
been able to study it.
More lemarkable than the supernovae
asociation was the discovery made at Mr.
Palomar with a 200 inch optical tele-
scope. In a very intense study of area*
of the sky where radiation had been
reported, a region of diffuse gaseous
nebulosity having very unusual properties
was discovered. A clue to its identity and
possibly other radio sources was given
in 1955 when the Mt. Palomar telescope
observed that the other bright radio
source, Cygnus A, shows a pair of galax-
ies in collision, 300 million light years
away! The radio energy given off in a
single second by this source was de-
termined to be enough to supply all of
the heat and power requirements on earth
for the next trillion years!
Our Solar System Is Also a "Source"
The new University telescope will also
be capable of observing six known radio

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


in dally operation by the University on
Peach Mountain, has detected some
new and unusual signals from the sun.
sources in our own solar system. The first
is the sun from which astronomers have
detected a constant signal when it is
in a "quiet" state and a variable note
when disturbances on the sun are evident
by radio fadeouts and magnetic storms
on the earth. A smaller 28 foot radio
telescope in operation daily on Peach
Mountain has already recorded some new
and unusual signals from the sun. With
the new instrument, it will be possible
to focus on only three per cent of the
sun's surface at a time, enabling a con-
centrated study of the sun to be con-
ducted. Secondly, our moon also radiates
radio waves which recently were used by
the Naval Research Laboratory to plot
the temperature across its surface with
their 50 foot unit. In addition to the sun
and the moon, the radiation from four
of the planets, Jupiter, Mars, Saturn,
and Venus, will also be studied.
It has also been proposed that radio
telescopes could be used to bounce waves
off nearby planets, our sun, and the
earth's satellites. The Jodrell Bank 250
foot radio telescope in England is so
sensitive that it can detect radio waves
that man bounced off the moon. Changes
in the reflected waves reveal how many
electrons exist in space between the earth
and the moon. In like manner, waves
could be bounced off the planet Venus
and be detected by a telescope, even
though it would be nearly 10 million
times harder. In the few months that it
has been in operation, the Jodrell Bank
telescope has already done a great deal
of the tracking of the earth's artificial
satellites by bouncing radio waves off
them.
Michigan Telescope To Be Second
Largest
Compared with the English telescope,
the proposed University of Michigan in-
strument will be the second largest
steerable telescope in the world, but will
be capable of operating at wavelengths
5 to 10 times shorter than the English
unit. At the present time, however, the
largest unit in operation in the United
States is an 84 foot telescope at the Naval
Research Laboratory. This Laboratory,
using both the 84 foot and an older 50
foot paraboloid, has done extensive re-
search to confirm the high velocities of
radio sources relative to the earth. Har-
vard University has also contributed to
radio astronomy by substantiating the
theory of star formation. At the same
time that the University of Michigan will
be building its 85 foot radio telescope,
the National Science Foundation will be
completing an exact counterpart of it on
a 2,000 acre grant of land in the hills
of West Virginia. The Foundation also
plans to build a 140 foot paraboloid
steerable telescope at this same site by
I960. Perhaps the most interesting an-
tenae that have been used in telescopes
are the salvaged "giant Wurzburgs", 25
foot dishes built by the Germans in
World War II for radar systems. Over
a dozen nations in Europe, and Asia and
the United States are known to be using
these dishes!
Though radio astronomy is in the same
stage of infancy as was visual astronomy
in Galileo's time, great forward strides
have been made since 1932. Not only
have countries all over the world striven
to build as large and nearly-perfect a
radio telescope as posible, but they have
also mapped an entire new picture of our
universe. Yet, even as the University of
Michigan is completing plans for the
second largest steerable telescope in the
world, Dr. Chihiro Kikuchi of the Uni-
versity is working on a new, low-
temperature device, known as the solid-
state maser, which would amplify the
very faint signals and increase manyfold
the range of our present day scopes. Thus,
radio astronomy finds a rebirth and can
expect an active future in the United
States, the country in which it had its
beginning.

IN U. S. MISSILES
In the wake of numerous and sometimes con-
fusing missile developments, a former Technic
editor takes a clear-cut, comprehensive look at
our entire G.M. program.
by BERT HILBURGER, '58E
Of recent date, much has been written
and reiterate concerning our lagging
missile and satellite programs and the
accelerated programs of the Soviets. Much
has been written and spoken about
the shameful rivalry which exists between
the services. As a result, little or nothing
has been discussed with regard to our
total missile setup. The general American
public and even people closely connected
with developments along these lines are
unaware of the many programs which
have been established in recent years. It
might be well to point out what these
different programs are, the types of
missiles being designed or placed into
service, within whose realm (which
military service) they stand, and who the
prime contractor is in each case.
At the present time, upon the order
of the ex-Secretary of Defense, C. E.
Wilson, the Army is restricted to ranges
of up to 200-miles for their tactical
missiles and the Air Force takes on from
there, presumably ad infinitum. The Navy
is restricted to those missiles alone which
can be launched from shipboard, whether
this be surface craft or submarine. Al-
ready a problem arises. Through wide
press coverage, the public has become
acquainted with the Army's IRBM (i.e.,
intermediate range ballistic missile), the
Chrysler Jupiter. Since this calls for a
range of 1500 miles, it seems there
is a discrepancy from the previously
announced maximum range allowed to
the Army of 200 miles. The truth is
that the Army contract was awarded be-
fore Wilson's decrees and the Army was
allowed to continue work on the project
until the time the missile should become
operational. At that time it would be
placed in service by the Air Force to
complement its own Thor.
Rumor has it that this arbitrary range
decree will become somewhat more re-
laxed in the near future, since only a
short time ago, Defense Secretary Mc-
Elroy ordered the Army to start work
on a smaller, solid-fuel replacement for
the current 200-mile Redstone. This new
one is to have a range of 500 miles. For
the benefit of the country's space pro-
gram, this range restriction of the various
services will have to be improved; per-
haps the whole missile and satellite pro-
gram will be placed under a central
agency, there-by by-passing any inter-
service rivalry and pooling all available
knowledge and resources. Until that
time, however, there will be a great
amount of confusion. This article is an
attempt to clear up some of these points.
Missiles can be placed in several
different categories, some of which over-
lap one another, adding still more to
existing difficulties. Powerplants include
turbojets, ramjets, solid-fuel rockets and
liquid-fuel rockets. There are intercon-
tinental ballistic missies (ICBM, range:
5500 miles), intercontinental guided (air-
breathing) missiles, intermediate range
ballistic missies (IRBM, range: 1500
miles), penetration missiles, defense
missiles and tactical missiles. There are
surface-to-surface missiles (SSM), sur-
face-to-air missiles (SAM), air-to-air
missiles (AAM), and air-to-surface
missiles (ASM).
The reader is now thoroughly con-
fused, but we will endeavor to untie
the knots.
Due to their nature, turbojets and
ramjets must necessarily be employed
within the reaches of the earth's atmos-
phere, while rockets adapt themselves to
any environment, whether gaseous or
vacume. Liquid-fueled rockets employ
propellants such as kerosene with a liquid
oxidizer. Solid-fuel rockets make use of
a slow-burning chemical compound to
provide their thrust.
Ballistic missiles (whether IRBMs or

ICBMs) are of an essentially non-guided
variety. These are given their "instruc-
tions" in only the very first few moments
of flight. After this initial guidance, the
rocket follows a "ballistic" or bullet-like
trajectory, escaping the earth's atmosphere
and then re-entering as it falls toward
the target at a speed approximately
15,000 mph. Atlas and Titan are examples
of ICBMs; Jupiter, Thor and Polaris are
examples of IRBMs. Until the ballistic
missiles are ready, the Air Force must
depend on its air-breathing long-range
missiles. The Snark is such a vehicle with
a 5000-mile range, but its speed is a
subsonic 650 mph. It could carry a
nuclear warhead or might act as a decoy
to lure enemy defenders while our bomb-
ers strike elsewhere. North America's
Navaho was a more sophisticated model,
but was cancelled last summer due to
the rapid progress of the much advanced
ICBMs.
Penetration missiles are closer to oper-
ational status than the ballistic missiles
These had their rudimentary beginnings
in World War II as the rockets which
were fired from the wings of attack
planes and fighter bombers for use
against tanks and pillboxes. They have
since grown up, however. One variety,

the Bell Rascal is designed for use by
SACs B-47 and B-52 bombers which will
carry it to within 100 miles or so of
its destination at subsonic speeds. Here
it is released and will fly the remainder
of the distance to target at supersonic
speeds (1000 mph), carrying a hydrogen
warhead. Another type is the Fairchild
Goose, intended to take electronic
countermeasures over enemy territory to
mix up their radar. The Northrop Cross-
bow is an extremely accurate ASM
designed to home in on enemy radar
stations and kill them.
Perhaps the most vital area of develop-
ment today lies in the realm of the
defense missile. Our defenses against
enemy bombers are certainly inadequate,
but estimates are that 1965 is the earliest
possible date to have proper defenses
against enemy missiles. The Nike Ajax
was the first missile designed for defense
against enemy invaders from the air.
However, with a range of only 25 miles
and a guidance system easily fooled by
enemy countermeasures, it is rapidly be-
coming obsolete. Meanwhile, the Army
is well along on the development of the
Nike Hercules as a replacement. The
Bomarc is a ramjet-powered interceptor
to kill enemy aircraft 350 miles away
and 60,000 feet up. A non-guided atomic
missile that can kill at a range of a
half-mile or more by the brute force of
its explosion is the Douglas Genie.
Raytheon's Hawk is designed to meet
attacking enemy bombers swooping in at
low level beneath U.S. radar.
The real problem at the present time
as mentioned just a moment ago is the
development of the anti-missile missile.
The problem is extreme and is presented
thus:
Within 15 minutes, the anti-missile
system must 1) detect the enemy missile
or missiles hurtling toward their targets;
2) track, determine and hold fast on the
exact ballistic trajectory; 3) set its own
course to the target; 4) blast off; and
5) climb, intercept and kill at an altitude
above 30,000 feet to insure protection
for those on the ground. The problems
are stupendous, and the program barely
begun. The Air Force is considering
development of Convair's Wizard and
the Army Chrysler's Nike Zeus, but these
will take seven years to become opera-
tional.
Tactical missiles are mainly the Army's
meat, although the Navy has its hand
in the pie as well. Most of these are
mere extensions of long-range artillery.
The Air Forces Martin Matador and
Navy's Chance Vought Regulus I are
winged guided missiles which could be
jammed or shot down if spotted in time.
The Army has for some time had an
arsenal of operational short-range battle-
field ballistic missiles not unlike the old
German V-2s, which are equipped with
atomic warheads. The Redstone is a
liquid-fuel, 200-mile ballistic missile, and

as mentioned earlier, a solid-fuel replace-
ment has been ordered to overcome the
difficulties and delays of fueling such
a missile. Operational in Europe, the
Corporal is radio-controlled to ranges
between 75 and 100 miles. Honest John,
also operational in Europe has a range
of 15 to 20 miles. For close-up tactical
support is the LaCrosse, a truck-
launched artillery rocket good for a range
of 8 to 10 miles. Designed to knock out
enemy tanks at a 2-mile range is the
stub-winged Dart.
Looking toward the future, the Air
Force is developing a space project called
Big Brother or Pie Piper. This is to be
a satellite program designed as a con-
tinual survey of the world reported by
television and other means.
Our discussion has not included the
familiar Vanguard, for that was designed
exclusively for the IGY satellite program.
However, it is more advanced than many
of our other rockets and might con-
ceivably be added to our arsenal of
IRBMs. At this time, a point of clari-
fication might be made regarding the
U.S.'s other satellite vehicle, the Jupiter-
C. Its name belies that it is a modified
Jupiter IRBM. Such is not case; rather,
it is a modified Redstone 200-mile ar-
tillery rocket employing clusters of solid
propellant rockets in the second and third
stages and a single solid propellant rocket
in the fourth. If a standard Jupiter or
Thor, or even better, an Atlas were used,
the payload would more nearly approach
that of the Sputnik II.
While we are busy developing those
missiles which have been mentioned in
context, it must be remembered that
these are but the first generation of
missiles. In the months to come, the
government is sure to start awarding
contracts for the so-called second-gener-
ation missiles. These will be operational
in the 1965-70 period, but it is im-
perative that we commence our prime
research work now so as not to be caught
napping as we were during the period
which preceded 1954.
Accompanying this text is a list which
attempts to compile a few facts about
most of the missiles in the current U.S.
program. If some have been left out it
is either because they were too old to
be included in the current program or
so new that their existence was unknown
at the time of printing.
Thus stands our missile program at
the present time. The program is not
as down-and-out as many people seemed
to think. Yet the views of Dr. Von
Braun were probably quite accurate when
he noted that we are one year behind
the Russians. He qualified this by saying
that if we should work 20% harder than
our opponents each year over the next
five years, we will then have caught up.

Quiet, Please . . .
A special report on the U-M North Campus
Acoustics Laboratory.
If you have ever walked into an un-
finished office or classroom that is
already in use, chances are good that you
have been struck by the intensity of the
sound produced by typewriters, moving
chairs, and other similar operations. Or
perhaps you have run a vacuum cleaner
or other household appliance and have
complained at the disturbance it causes.
In our modern age, where machines play
such a leading role, the cry is ever for
a little peace and quiet. How nice it
would be, you say, to be able to perform
all the mechanical operations to which
we are now accustomed without the ever-
present whine of gears, the clank of
mechanical linkages, or the whirr of
electric motors.
In answer to the pleas of the popula-
tion, certain scientists and engineers have
begun research aimed at discovering more
information about the mechanics of sound
and methods of reducing excess noise
caused by machines. Their research has
ranged from quieting vacuum cleaners
to damping ship hulls; from designing
ear plugs to fabricating mufflers for use
on heavy equipment. In short, a vast new
field of research has been opened — the
study of vibration damping and noise
reduction. A new title has been created
to describe the men who play the major
part in this program—the Acoustical
Engineers.
Although the science has been in
motion for a relatively short period of
time, many research facilities have groups
investigating noise. Such a group is the
Sound Laboratory of the Engineering
Research Institute of the University of
Michigan. Located one part at North
Campus and one part at Willow Run Air-
port, this group has been among the
pioneers in developing theories on noise
and methods for its reduction. As an
aid to understanding the work this group
performs, let us take a short tour of the
facilities at North Campus. The labora-
tories of this section of the group com-
prise several highly specialized rooms
in the east end of the M. E. Cooley
Memorial Laboratory.
of the reverberation room are specially
plastered to render the room almost com-
pletely reflective. In the center of the
room, a large, rectangular, paddle-shaped
aluminum vane rotates to break up any
standing waves that may be present
within the room. The effect of all these
features is either to present a uniform
sound field within the room or to apply
a constant sound pressure to a sample

closure. This is a large cubical chamber
mounted on rollers which slide up against
the outer surface of the reverberation
room and encloses the sample opening.
Whereas the reverberation room is almost
totally reflecting, the termination box is
just as totally absorbtive. The effect of
these two components operating in con-
junction with one another is one of two
possible effects depending on the type of
testing program underway. If sound
transmission studies are in progress, that
is, if the effectiveness of a material in
transmitting sound through its surface
is being measured, the exact amount of
sound coming through the panel can be
measured. In as much as the signal is
of constant magnitude and the termina-
tion box absorbs all reflections, the
difference between the sound pressure
level in the reverberation room and that
in the termination enclosure will be a
measure of the sound transmission effec-
tiveness of the sample. If, on the other
hand, the testing program is designed to
obtain the effectiveness of a device such
as a muffler, readings taken during
periods of operation with and without
the muffler may be used to compare the
effectiveness of the muffler.
Surrounding the reverberation room
and containing the termination box is the
control room. This is the center of the
testing area. It contains facilities for
measuring as well as generating noise.
This room around a room helps to
further guard the reverberation room
against changes due to building noise.
Adjacent to the control room is the

nature is performed. The fine comple-

the services, and a number of major
corporations — Westinghouse, Ford, and
Argus to name but a few. Some of the
work is necessarily classified for security
reasons, but much of the work is of
practical interest to the layman. Among
such projects are 1) the design and rating
of transmissions for automobiles; 2) the
silencing of a home movie projector; and
3) the design of suitable mufflers for
aircraft ground support equipment.
This work aids people in all walks of
life. Studies have demonstrated that the
efficiency of workers in any situation is
inversely proportional to the level of the
noise environment in which they must
work. Manufacturers have redesigned
their equipment for operation under the
quietest possible conditions. Managers of
large groups have incorporated the ad-
vice of acoustical engineers into their
working spaces and have been well re-
warded for their efforts.
In short, now that machinery has
become such a major factor in our present
economy, reduction of all possible noise
is a must in order to prevent disintegra-
tion of the human nervous system. With-
out proper silencing treatments, man can
not hope to live in the world he is
building. It is only through continual
research and development that we can
make life today and tomorow a pleasure
instead of a torture of grinds, squeals,
and clanks. Let us have quiet, please!

'TfCone 7&amp;cut a (pent
by DON WITHERS, '61E
Diamonds may be a girl's
best friend, but to industry they
are real working partners.
C '~T\ iamonds are a girl's best friend,"
.L/ or at least so the song states.
This phrase expresses the general con-
sensus that diamonds are primarily meant
for gemstones, and because of the great
amount of effort and expense necessary
to produce refined ones, are to be re-
garded as symbols of wealth and luxury.
Thus to the general public the diamond
serves only as an expensive ornament
or bauble. But to industry the diamond
serves a very practical purpose as a
valuable tool material.
The diamond, which is a pure or
nearly pure allotropic form of carbon,
is the hardest material known to man
because of its crystal structure. For this
reason industry uses diamonds to cut,
grind, and polish materials that could not
be machined as well with other tool
materials. This is true, for example, with
the medium-hard materials used in bear-
ings.
Industrial diamond tools fall into two
classes according to the state in which
the diamonds are used: cutting tools and
dies which employ solid diamonds, and
abrasive tools which employ diamond
powder, usually dispersed in a metallic
matrix. First to be considered, and of
the most importance as far as variations
go, will be the tools employing diamonds
in solid form, mounted in a metal wheel
or a tool blank.
Solid diamonds are mounted in a
strong metal tool blank to hold them
firmly in place, a condition necessary for
the optimum properties to be obtained.
In many machining tools a diamond tip
is used in place of the usual tool steel
tip because the diamond tip has the
ability to take and retain an extremely
sharp cutting edge. This sharp edge
allows closer dimensional tolerances and
smoother surface finishes than those ob-
tainable by the best metal tips. Also,
diamond tools are used to machine other
materials, such as synthetic sapphire,
which could not be feasibly cut by any
other means.
An example of the machine tools in
this group is the diamond-tipped lathe
tool used to machine bearing surfaces. The
diamond tip must be sharpened to a high
degree for machining bearing materials,
which consist of hard metal grains sur-
rounded by a matrix of softer and more
ductile metal grains. Metal cutting tips
are unsuited for this operation because
the cutting edge soon becomes dull
enough to pull the soft metal across the
face of the hard grains and partially
cover them. When this happens, the
bearing must be 'broken in' to remove
the flowed layer of soft metal, consuming
time and slightly decreasing the life of
the bearing. The retained sharpness of
the diamond tip prevents this problem
by not dragging soft metal across the
face of the hard grains.
Another example of this group is the
diamond-tipped tool used to true or shape
other tools made of hard materials
Grinding wheels made of tungsten or
silicon carbides are periodically trued on
the grinding edge by a diamond tool
This is done by rapidly rotating the
grinding wheel and moving the diamond
tool across the grinding edge or periphrey
of the wheel. Diamond tools themself
are occasionally re-finished by a diamond
tool. A diamond will normally need
little, if any, refinishing, but small
diamond points sometimes chip with im-

mond drills for industrial use.
proper handling. Of course, another
Diamond must be employed to sharpen
or shape the first.
In recent times, hardness testing has
come into great importance in the de-
termination of mechanical properties of
materials. Hardness testing machines,
such as Rockwell, Knoop, and Vickers
use diamond penetrators to obtain more
accurate results, particularly on hard
materials. These machines are based on
the principle that the depth of penetra-
tion of a standard diamond or steel tip
under standard pressure conditions in a
test specimen is inversely proportional
to the hardness of the specimen. A steel
tip is suitable for soft and medium hard
materials but is not suited for harder
materials because the tip will be de-
formed as well as the test piece. A
diamond tip, if properly mounted, will
overcome this problem. Hardness read-
ings of cemented carbides and even gems
have been recorded by means of diamond
penetrators.
An interesting sidelight to hardness
testing with a diamond is the fact that
a metallurgist, Boynton, succeeded in
relatively measuring the hardness of
cementite (Fe3C) with a diamond drill.
Boynton drilled a hole of standard depth
with a microscopic diamond drill in
individual crystals of various materials
and noted the number of revolutions that
were necessary to drill the standard hole.
The number of revolutions served as an
indication of the hardness.
Previously the hardness of pure ce-
mentite had been extremely difficult to
determine, because pure cementite is
usually not found in a large enough
grouping of crystals to permit measure-
ment. Boynton thus found the hardness
of a single crystal of cementite in rela-
tion to other materials, but unfortunately
the results could not be correlated with
other systems of measurement, such as
Rockwell, which measure the hardness of
a mass of crystals.
The oil industry makes use of a great
many solid diamonds in drilling oil and
and exploratory holes in rock formations.
Unlike metallic drilling heads, which chew
a complete hole in the rock, the diamond-
studded drilling head is hollow and cuts
a thick circle through the rock, leaving
intact a rock core inside the drill pipe.
This core is periodically broken off and
brought to the surface, where it may be
studied by geologists to obtain much
information about conditions under the
drilling site.
The drilling head itself is a thick
metal crown studded with diamonds
which is rotated by the drill casing that
extends to the surface. The diamonds
scrape and abrade away the rock in a
manner similar to that of a grinding
wheel. During the drilling operation
water or mud is pumped down the hole
to cool the drill and wash away the
scrapings. A stationary pipe is contained
in the drill casing by which the drill core
is brought to the surface.
Solid diamond tools are used extens-
ively in the granite or marble industry
for the machining of natural rocks. Steel
saws with diamond inserts are used to
quarry and cut chunks of stone to shape
because a diamond-rimmed saw will cut
faster than a metallic saw and will be
worn away less. Water is usually applied

to the cutting edge to wash away the
loose stone dust which, if allowed to
remain in the cut, would increase the
wear on the saw. Diamond saws are
fairly expensive, but their long life soon
repays the initial cost. Recently, however,
saws made of silicon carbide have been
able to cut at a faster rate than any
other man-made materials, but the dia-
mond-studded saw still has the fastest
rate.
Large marble columns, stone vases, and
urns are turned on large lathes similar
to those used for machining metal and
turning wood. Diamond-tipped tools are
used for the finishing operations and
smoothing processes. If a piece of stone
is to have a circular hole in it, a diamond
cutter of the type used in oil well drilling
is employed.
Industry has found many other uses
for diamonds to take advantage of their
unique properties. Tungsten wire fila-
ments are drawn through diamond dies
to achieve very fine diameters, glass
diffraction gratings (similar in effect to
prisms) are engraved with as many as
ten thousand lines to the inch by means
of diamond engraving points, phono-
graph record masters are scribed by
diamond styluses, .... The list is a
long one and is likely to increase.
The discovery of newer and better rare
earths and ceramics of great hardness
increases the need for the diamond tools
hard enough to cut them. Also, because
General Electric has succeeded in syn-
thesizing diamonds, diamonds will prob-
ably come into greater use through a
price decrease. New sensitive gyroscopes
for use in guided missiles will demand
many jewelled pivots and bearings to
decrease harmful wear, many of which
will be made of diamonds or machined
by them.
The second large group of diamond
tools is that employing diamond dust,
either used as a powder alone or dis-
persed in a metallic or resin base. Dia-
mond powder is mostly used in grinding
wheels and saws, where the diamond
powder and a metal powder are blended
and sintered together to form a solid
bond. Some grinding wheels are made so
thin that they are virtually wafers.
Before observing diamond powder
tools, let us digress a bit and study the
production and mounting of diamond
powder. Diamond power is made from
stones too small or imperfect to be
otherwise utilized, severely worn tool
diamonds, and sometimes diamond scraps
which remain after bleavage and bruiting
(diamond shaping processes). This raw
material, called boart, is placed in a steel
mortar and repeatedly struck by a falling
steel pestle which is rotated after each
stroke. The grain sizes of the powder
range from 0.4mm to 0.08mm in diam-
eter and must be graded. Very fine wire
screens of up to 400 mesh per inch are
used for the coarse grading. During the
final separation the power is mixed with
a viscous fluid and graded by selective
sedimentation. (The larger particles sct-

AND ITS CONTROL
With continual industrial expansion, smog is
becoming a considerable problem to almost
half of the U. S. population.
by BRYAN WHIPPLE, '61E
Donora, Pennsylvania, an industrial
town of 15,000, awoke on Octo-
ber 27, 1948 to find itself enshrouded
in an evil-smelling fog bank. This cloud
of choking gloom had drifted off the
nearby Monongahela River, absorbed
lethal chemicals from riverside zinc and
steel mills, and was accumulating in the
confines of the river valley. As October
changed into November, residents of
Donora began waking in their sleep,
gasping for air.
Within 48 hours, 19 persons died of
respiratory ill effects, and 400 others were
hospitalized, poisoned by the chemical-
laden fog now familiarly known as smog.
The Donora tragedy was by no means
our first experience with the effects of
cumulative air poisoning, either due to
topography or from absorbtion by mist.
London's pea soup fog soaks up the
coal smoke poured forth from her many
homes and factories creating a health
problem that has existed for centuries.
Since World War II, California's San
Gabriel valley, including the Los Angeles
metropolitan district, has had to share
its reputation for sunshine and a healthy
climate with reports of eye-searing smog,
largely due to the concentration of oil
refineries in that area.
Smog is Widespread
Air polution of the smog variety is
not confined to these notorious centers
by any means. Seventy-six million resi-
dents of the United States, nearly half
of the population, are living in areas
of air pollution, according to Dr. Lauren
B. Hitchcock, president of the Air Pol-
lution Foundation. "Far from being an
isolated problem characteristic of Los
Angeles, of such cities as Chicago or
New Orleans,'' stated Dr. Hitchcock,
'air pollution is causing concern in the
East as well because forty percent of the
76,000,000 Americans living in smog
areas are residents of Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York,
New Jersey, and Pennsylvania."
Dr. Hitchcock demonstrated to a geo-
graphical convention at UCLA that the
expense of smog-polluted air during the
next 25 years may exceed the costs of
all our wars of the preceding 50 years.
Factors included were one billion dollars'
worth of partially burned gasoline, nearly
as much again in industrial fuel literally
"up in smoke", and at least one billion
dollars' damage to buildings and cloth-
ing, added to incalculable crop losses
and corrosion and deterioration of metals
and other materials.
Dr. Hitchcock did not attempt to
evaluate the losses of health and life
which accompany air pollution.
A Sketch in Smoke
Nearly anything foreign which may
become dispersed in the atmosphere may
be considered a pollutant. Each human
inhales about thirty pounds of air daily.
Unlike food or drink, we must continual-
ly consume air with little regard to its
quality. Exceptionally impure air will
sometimes provoke us to seek fresher
air, but when the concentration or nature
of the pollutants is such that they are
inhaled unnoticed, we are prey to their
cumulative effects.
There are, therefore, a multiplicity of
airborne poisons. Many are from the
combustion of fuel. Some are the gaseous
products fo chemical processes. Still
others are the vapors of volatile liquids
Lastly some are just plain dirt.
The burning of coal produces dis-
charges of ash ("fly ash"), soot, water
vapor, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide,
oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbons, ethers,
ketones, and organic acids. The quantity
of impurities discharged is great—every
year the combustion of coal and coke in
the Detroit-Windsor area releases about
430,000 tons of sulfur dioxide alone
into the air.
Although liquid fuels and gases burn
more cleanly, they produce more exotic
poisons: all manners of organics, includ-
ing methane, acetylene, aldehydes, phen-
ols, alcohols, and ammoniates. Estimates
on the Los Angeles area show that the
four million gallons of fuel that city's
two million motor vehicles burn daily
produce four billion cubic feet of ex-
haust. This is equivalent to 125.000 tons
of fresh air, and it is from but a single
source.
The actual quantity of this solid
matter in the air, may be measured by
passing normal city air through suitable
filters, and contrasting the weight of the
trapped soot with the volume of air
passed. Sample measurements of atmos-
pheric pollution may also be made by
weighing the deposition of filth on a
test area over a given period. In Grafton.
W.Va., this non-radioactive fallout
amounted to 1,876 tons per year per
square mile.
Corresponding measurements for cer-
tain large cities showed the following
fallouts in tons per year per sq. mi.:

L.A. Smog
Sunshine, not fog, causes the worries
in the Los Angeles instance. Sunlight,
it has been shown, acts upon unsaturated
organic compounds of high vapor pres-
sure at room temperature in the presence
of nitrogen dioxide to yield the poison-
ous irritating gas, ozone, along with
oxygenated organic compounds. The most
affected chemicals were butodiene, 2 -
olefins, alcohols, and aldehydes.
Los Angeles lies in a valley, 60 miles
long by 25 miles wide, and surrounded
on three sides by very high slopes. Cool
dense Pacific air effectively walls in the
fourth side. Hot air from the Majone
Desert, to the east, drifts west over the
mountains, sliding over the cool air,
creating a temperature inversion, in
which warm air overlays cold. Since the
cool air has no tendency to displace the
hot air above it, vertical air circulation
ceases. When the interlayer division is
especially low, which may happen on
very warm days, the few mountain passes
providing ventilation are sealed off. The
air just sits there and gets dirtier and
dirtier.
London smog is true smog in that it
is the absorption of smoke by fog.As
early as the thirteenth century, coal smoke
was a nuisance and a hazard in the
British capital. The industrial revolution,
with its resultant stepup of the com-
bustion of coal, combined with the
tendency toward a greater degree of
urbanization has created a lasting prob-
lem of tragic proportions.
December of 1952 found London
immersed in one of the heaviest and
most persistent fogs of recent years.
Severely cold weather and high industrial
activity quickly brought concentrations of
carbon monoxide and sulfur oxides up
to ten times normal levels. At least 4,000
deaths from bronchitis and pneumonia
during this month were directly attrib-
utable to the smog.
The smog affected persons of all ages,
but principally children and adults over
45. The lapse between the incidence of
the fog and the bronchitis mortality rate
increase to eight times normal was less
than one day.
London domestic fires alone pour out
120,000 tons of smoke annually over an
area of 700 square miles, in which Si/&gt;
million persons reside.
Chemical analysis of London smog has
shown 2.8 micrograms of 3,-1 - benzo-

pyrene, a known carcinogenic, to be
dispersed per 100 cubic meters. A person
smoking 40 average cigarettes daily
would inhale 150 grams of this substance
yearly. He would also inhale about 200
grams from the air in an average British
city.
We have shown above how the quant-
ity, of a known cancer-producing sub-
stance (3,4 - benzopyrene), inhaled from
the atmosphere may exceed that inhaled
from cigarettes by a heavy smoker. When
all the sources of obnoxious chemical
compounds are considered, the list of
possible atmospheric contaminants is
longer and more awesome even than an
analysis of tobacco smoke. Additionally,
nearly every gas and aerosol has a unique
effect on the body.
Sulfur Compounds
The gaseous compounds of sulfur are
the best known of all distinct air pol-
lutants. Of these, sulfur dioxide has re-
ceived the most attention due to extensive
crop damage during the early years of
this century resulting from high concen-
trations of the pugent anhydride poured
forth from smelting stacks. The amount
of sulfur dioxide in the air is often
considered a good index to the degree of
total industrial air pollution.
The average person can detect SO,
odor and taste at concentrations of about
3 ppm. At 10 ppm. irritation of the
throat becomes severe, and 15 ppm. is
the maximum concentration that is en-
durable for one hour or more. Asthmatics
suffer severe mucous irritation at much
lower concentrations. Vegetation is
stunted and discolored by concentrations
above 0.5 ppm.
Sulfur dioxide in the air is the prin-
cipal cause for the acidity of rain and
fog since it is an acid anhydride, and
as a result it contributes extensively to
the corrosion of buildings and exposed
metallic objects. Sunlight is known to
oxidize it slowly to sulfur trioxide which,
in the presence of fog, hydrolyzes to a
sulfuric acid mist. The mist thus formed
persists after the relative humidity drops
to a point where ordinary pure mists
evaporate; these sulfuric acid mists are
now known to be a chief contributing
factor to the reduction of visibility in a
Los Angeles smog.
Hydrogen sulfide is not frequently
encountered because of the ease with
which it may be oxidized to the less
offensive sulfur dioxide. However, where
it does exist, even a small quantity will
attack leaded paints, causing darkening
and discoloration. When inhaled, it af-
fects temporary muscular cramps and
paralysis.
Other sulfur compounds deserving
mention are the persulfides of hydrogen
H.S., and H2Sa; elemental sulfur, which
has a lachrywatory effect; and thiophene
and the mercaptans, always readily de-
tected because of their extremely revolt-

seldom present in concentrations high
enough to make them offensive per se;
however, they contribute to air pollution
by catalyzing certain other reactions. We
have already mentioned the catalysis of
unsaturated organics by N02 to ozone
and highly reactive oxygenated com-
pounds. Nitrogen oxides also catalyze
the oxidation of SO, to S03 in aqueous
solutions, and are therefore responsible
for increasing the acidity of smog.
These nitrogen oxides are formed in
the combustion of fuels, particularly those
which contain ammonia. Chemical pro-
cesses involving the reduction of nitric
or other acids, and oil refinery cracking
reactions are also contributory. The re-
moval of the oxides of nitrogen from
industrial waste gases is slow and ex-
pensive, and depends on the oxidation
of NO to N02 and the absorbtion of the
latter in water solution.
Ammonia is discharged into the air
from certain refinery operations and
chemical plants and where ever organic
matter is decomposing, particularly stock-
yards. Since ammonia is a basic amhy-
dride it tends to neutralize acidic atmos-
pheres, and is in this manner beneficial
however, it is seldom present in the right
place in the right amount, and its re-
action with acidic gases results in an
aerosal of ammonium salt which imports
haze to the air.
Halogen Compounds
Among the halogen compounds, hy-
drogen fluoride is the most offensive
atmospheric pollutant. It occurs in the
air chiefly from the hydrolysis of silicon
tetrafluoride, a volatile substance rendered
by the treatment of minerals containing
both sand and some fluoride with heat
or acid. Such processes are used in the
production of aluminum and of phos-
phate fertilizers; these are the primary
offenders.
This gas affects the physiology both
from direct inhalation or from eating
plants which have been exposed to it.
As a gas it causes irritation of the throat
and coughing. Chronic exposure and con-
sumption of afflicted vegetation causes
the condition known as fluorosis, a
mottling of the enamel of the teeth.
Hydrogen chloride, and its hydrolyzed
form, hydrochloric acid, are discharged
from oil refineries and chemical plants in
small quantities.
The gas may also be formed by the
oxidation by water of sufur dioxide
absorbed on minute droplets of air-dis-
persed sea water. Hydrogen chloride, like
sulfur dioxide, is hygroscopic and may
be present in hydrolyzed form in a mist
at humidities which would completely
evaporate pure fog.
Organic chlorides are known to be, as
a class, among the most irritating of all
substances. All produce eye irritation and
lachrymation at low concentrations, par-
ticularly chlorinated aldehydes, ketones,
and nitrites. Cyasiogen chloride affects
the eyes at concentrations of less than
0.05 p.m.m. Three of the compounds
used in tear gases, bromobenzylcyanide,
chloroacetophenone, and chloracetone,
may be present — compounds of very
similar structure and effect have been
found in industrial waste gases.
Combustion Product's
Carbon dioxide is not a health hazard
under usual conditions as long as suffi-
cient oxygen is present. CO, concentra-
tions of over 5 percent causes difficulty
in breathing, but there are not toxic
effects.
Carbon monoxide, however, is a dan-
gerous cumulative poison which, when
absorbed into the blood stream reacts
with the hemoglobin, impairing the cir-
culation of oxygen and eventually causing
suffocation. It is a product of the in-
complete combustion of carbonaceous
fuels, and being odorless and colorless,
may often escape detection. When con-
centrate gas are below the maximum
safe value it cannot be considered ob-
noxious.
Exhaust gases from the incomplete
combustion of liquid hydrocarbons, such
as gasoline are varied, as we have noted,
and several of them are particularly
obnoxious. Formaldehyde and acrolein are
present in the exhaust of automobiles,
especially when the combustion is ac-
companied by a temporary shortage of
oxygen, as is apt to occur in stop and
go city driving. Automobile exhaust also
contains ethene, ethane, methane, and
acetlyene in abundance, as well as higher-
weight aldehydes which are very obnox-
ious if they should become chlorinated,
as mentioned above.
Smog Control
There is no all-inclusive pancea for
smog-ridden districts—partly because of
the multiplicity of causes, and partly due
to their inalterable nature. It is not within
the power of smog fighters to level
mountain ranges or to convince people
to use their cars less. Smoke-filtering
mufflers have been proposed for new
cars, but their expense has prevented wide
use. Smoke abatement laws are frequently
difficult to pass and enforce. In Pitts-
burgh, Pa., a city which has effectively
combatted industrial smoke, one official
stated, "It took us twenty-five years to
cure our smog problem — twenty years
to get rid of poditicians and five to
get rid of the smoke."
Co-operation of industries seems to be
the most practical way to alleviate air
pollution. Elaborate filters, washing sys-
tems, electrostatic precipitators, and better
control of combustion have helped.
Systematic location of sources of principle
irritants, coupled with specific techniques
for their elimination, seems to be the
most promising method in many places.
Air pollution is a long-standing problem
which only recently has gained scienrifc
attention.
The battle for its reduction to liveable
proportions promises to be a lengthy one.

With the space age just around the corner
the problems comforting man in his conquest
of space are becoming more and more impor-
tant, by JOHN COWLES, Grad.
Whether struggling with some poten-
tially practical, abstract concept in
the laboratory, or simply keeping one
jump ahead of an over zealous sales de-
partment, engineers are by nature con-
cerned with thinking in terms of future
projects. It is not unlikely, therefore, that
many students in the field of engineering
have been looking ahead at the possible-
developments in the extra-terrestial mis-
sile programs now being so ardently pur-
sued around the world. In an amazingly
short period concepts of space flight have
evolved from the "never-never" land of
the Sunday supplements to the stark
reality of the front page headlines. It
would seem by extrapolation that manned
satellites, moon rockets, and general free
wheeling around the solar system in space
vehicles are just around the corner.
Continuing in such a euphemistic vein
(in obviously unwarranted fashion)
some problems arising from the conquest
of space must be examined. Consider
first of all that the feasible interplanetary
space vehicles which are at present prob-
ably not even in the drafting board stage
are a fait accompli. It is now possible to
proceed to analyze the distant future with-
out entanglement in such a now-contro-
versial subject as the credibility of claims
and counterclaims of warring tribes of
missile experts. Similarly, the degree of
military necessity and/or need for na-
tional prestige necessary to finance the
project of space vehicle construction ran
fortunately be ignored.
Accept, then, the fact that men are
able to blast off this planet and touch
down on other bodies in the solar sys-
tem and return to earth. We are now
faced by the question of what prepara-
tions will have to be made before man
can successfully survive under the alien
environments found on these bodies. The
problem of retrieving useful data under
these conditions is also pertinent.
The first item to consider will naturally
have to be the possible destination of
space trips taken in our solar system. The
prime objectives will probably be our
moon, the inner planets Mars, Venus,
Mercury, various satellites of Jupiter and
Saturn, and possibly the three outer
planets, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto.
Rather than discuss space travel equip-
ment, a brief physical description of
these solar bodies should point out the
major engineering problems encountered
in interplanatory survival.
By observation of stars passing behind
the disc of the moon and considerations
of the thermal motions of gases in a
gravitational field it is apparent that the
moon possesses negligible atmosphere.
With no "atmospheric insulation", the
surface temperature varies from +130°
C to —150° C during a "day" about one
month long. The surface is composed of
relatively level areas called seas, and
craters of lava caused by collisions of
meteorites with the moon. Diameters of
these craters range from 1 km to 236 km.
and the falls may rise as high as 22,000
feet.
For a number of theoretical reasons it
is thought that the surface of the moon
is covered with a layer of pumice dust
which may be anywhere from a few centi-
meters to a kilometer thick. As the moon
has only one-eighth the mass of the earth,
the gravitational force at its surface is
only one-sixth of that experienced at the
surface of the earth. It is generally con-
sidered impossible that life exists on the
moon.
The Martian atmosphere is much less
dense than the earth's. Its constituents
are thought to be argon and nitrogen
with a trace of carbon dioxide and water.
The surface is esentially that of a geo-
logically much older earth; i.e., consisting
of low worn mountains and plains of
various metal oxides. A plurality of
astronomers agree that some -water is
present on the surface as evidenced by
the seasonal growth and decay of the
polar "ice caps." Lower plant forms such
as lichens are thought to exist. The
diameter of the planet is about one half
the earth's, while the day is approxi-
mately the same and the surface gravita-
tional acceleration is .4 g. During the
700 day Martian year temperatures range
from +60° to far below zero.

Little is known about the surface of
Venus, since the atmosphere consists of
opaque clouds of dust or oil droplets.
The planet is about the same size as the
earth and has an estimated period of
rotation of greater than 20 days. The
surface is hypothesized to contain seas of
oil large enough to make any petroleum
company "green with envy."
Mercury is probably similar to our
moon. The major difference is the surface
temperature which varies from +167°
C (on the side which faces the sun) to
far below zero on the side facing space.
Man would be forced to land in the
twilight region between the sunlit and
dark sides.
Jupiter is interesting in that it is com-
posed mainly of hydrogen and lighter
elements. The surface is composed of
rather indefinable clouds of hydrogen.
Landing on the "surface" is probably
out of the question due to the gravita-
tional force of 2.64 g at the "surface."
Saturn also is thought to be about
eighty per cent hydrogen, while Uranus
and Neptune are probably mainly water,
methane, and ammonia. Observations of
Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune would
initially be made from some of their
larger satellites which range from one to
two masses in size. The landing on Titan,
a moon of Saturn, would be difficult
because it has a substantial atmosphere
of methane. In other respects survival
on these moons should be no more com-
plex than survival on our own moon
except for the lower surface temperatures
due to increased distance from the sun.
Little is known about Pluto (thought
to be an escaped satelite of Neptune)
except that it may be roughly the same
size as the earth.
The above facts and other pertinent
physical information concerning planes
and satellites are best summarized in
Table I. (Turn to page 44).
From these descriptions it should be
clear that many phases of science and
engineering would be involved in equip-
ping man for extraterrestial survival.

radiation damage on airless planets; in-

Humanity is groaning, half-crushed under the
weight of the progress it has made. Men do not
sufficiently realize tnat their future depends on
themselves. They must first decide whether they
wish to continue to live. They must then ask
whether they want merely to live, or to make the
further effort necessary to fulfill, even on our
unmanageable planet, the essential function of
the universe, which is a machine for making gods.

Now on many supertankers, ductile iron is a new material widely used by today's engineers in designing heavy-duty equipment.
Ductile Iron...another Inco Research first
Over five miles of ductile iron pipe
going into many of today's supertankers
A deep sea tanker takes many a heavy
beating when waves are rough.
With each pitch and roll, she has to
weave. And her five or more miles of
piping have to weave with her.
If it is ductile iron piping, every pipe
length gives without break or leak.
Bends without breaking
Ductile iron is not only ductile, but also
tough. And resistant to the corrosive
action of sea water and sulfur laden
crude oil.
In some tankers, gray cast iron pipe
resists corrosion for ten years or more.
Sometimes, though, it's cracked and
broken by the pounding of heavy seas
that overtax its strength.
In other tankers, steel pipe outrides
such storms without damage. But it cor-
rodes so badly it may have to be replaced
every three or four years when han-
dling sour crudes.
Ductile iron pipe, tanker owners find,
combines the low cost and demonstrated
corrosion resistance of cast iron with
the tough strength of carbon steel.
So today, many of the newest tankers
carry pipe and fittings of ductile iron.
Ductile Iron also under city streets
The properties that prove ductile iron
pipe suitable for tankers also commend
it to municipal and utility engineers. So
this shock-and-corrosion resisting pipe
is used for water and gas mains. It may
soon be under the streets in your town.
Ductile iron has many uses —from
plowshares to jet plane parts. And cost-
conscious industry is constantly finding
new ways to use this versatile money-
saving, Inco-developed material.

by BOB RUSNAK, '60E
The University of Michigan has
pioneered in the development of
progressive education in its engineering
college. Today, the courses are taught
so that the student learns basic principles
and fundamentals rather than bare facts
(which he usually forgets anyway). The
premium is on problem analysis rather
than memorization. This development is
not complete, but it is fostered by the
use of open book tests and by the intro-
duction of the science engineering pro-
gram. Things were not always this way;
twenty-five years ago Steiner Vaksdal, an
engineering student, wrote an article in
the "Technic" describing his dissatisfac-
tion with the curriculum. It is interesting
to note that several of the changes which
he advocates have been incorporated into
the engineering curriculum.
"When the Engineering student enters
college, he is confronted with no fewer
than twenty-five distinct major divisions
of curricula. Within each of these di-
visions there is a further array of options
and sub-options. Is it possible for any
student to know into which one of these
many fields his career is to fall? The
answer is obvious. This seemingly im-
portant question has received entirely too
little attention. It is a well established
fact that the academically trained engineer
very rarely wins distinction in the field
for which he has schooled himself. A
certain successful Chemical Engineer re-
ceived his degree in Electrical Engineer-
ing. Any number of similar instances
could be mentioned. From such cases it
becomes evident that almost any curric-
ulum in engineering will suffice as long
as it is founded on fundamental princi-
ples.
"The student after his first two years
in college is required to select his major
division of Engineering and is then put
through the mill. He is forced to march
lockstep with his fellow students through
a more or less definitely laid out curric-
ulum. A curriculum that seems to have
for its objective the idea that the student
should gorge his memory with facts,
figures, and rules about the largest
possible number of things. The engineer-
ing student is made to learn chemical
compositions of different metals, or some-
body's pet formula for buttoning up a
riveted joint. He merely learns and
memorizes facts, formula, and rules
which will be more than half forgotten
and inert before the ink is dry on his
diploma. On top of this the burden is
increased by long and exacting tabula-
tions of data and numerous routine re-
ports. The desired object of stimulating
scientific thinking is dampened by this
setup. What happens when the student
with his crowded curriculum stops to
think and analyze some problem? That
long laboratory report will be late, that
formula won't be memorized. The inde-
pendent thinking is really smothered
under the great tonnage of engineering
facts and formulas. The memorized hand
book information is not of such great
importance when the engineer gets on
the job where new problems arise every
day, problems that do not come in neatly
wrapped packages, labelled and classified.
Any professional work is a live thing
relating rapidly changing conditions, so
why waste time learning details and mis-
cellaneous facts that can be learned far
more effectively on the job? The time in
school should be spent learning funda-
mental principles and in learning how
to think. Every engineer specializes
sooner or later and will, if he is a first
class man, specialize more and more
intensely all his life. If during his under-
graduate years a firm foundation can be
laid for this specialization, a very effective
contribution will have been made to his
career.
"Something however, should be said in
defense of the present curriculum. The
administration of the leading engineering
schools realize, I believe, the above situa-
tion and are doing a great deal to correct
it. All broadminded professors are re-
quiring less and less memory work, and
open book examinations are becoming
more and more popular. The rapid strides
in engineering has necessitated the crowd-
ing of material to such an extent that it
has become difficult to cover the necessary
subjects in a period of four years. Be-
cause of this crowding, the time provided
for constructive and independent think-
ing has been very limited. A solution
to the problem might be the establish-
ment of a five or six year course in which
the student would be given time for
independent thinking. Such a cour«
would not attempt to teach in detail any
one branch of engineering. Its graduates
may not know so much, but they will
have the grace of knowing what to do
about it. It must be remembered, how-
ever, that it is not an easy thing to
change a curriculum overnight."

in the field of Materials Engineering
The development of more advanced,
far more powerful aircraft engines
depends to a high degree on the de-
velopment of new and improved
materials and methods of processing
them. Such materials and methods,
of course, are particularly important
in the nuclear field.
At Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, the
physical, metallurgical, chemical
and mechanical properties of each
new material are studied in minute
detail, compared with properties of
known materials, then carefully ana-
lyzed and evaluated according to
their potential usefulness in aircraft
engine application.
The nuclear physics of reactor
materials as well as penetration and
effects of radiation on matter are
important aspects of the nuclear re-
actor program now under way at
P &amp; W A. Stress analysis by strain
gage and X-ray diffraction is an-
other notable phase of investigation.
In the metallurgical field, mate-
rials work involves studies of corro-
sion resistance, high-temperature
mechanical and physical properties
of metals and alloys, and fabrication
techniques.
Mechanical-testing work delves
into design and supervision of test
equipment to evaluate fatigue, wear,
and elevated-temperature strength
of materials. It also involves deter-
mination of the influence of part
design on these properties.
In the field of chemistry, investi-
gations are made of fuels, high-tem-
perature lubricants, elastomeric
compounds, electro-chemical and or-
ganic coatings. Inorganic substances,
too, must be prepared and their
properties determined.
While materials engineering as-
signments, themselves, involve dif-
ferent types of engineering talent,
the field is only one of a broadly
diversified engineering program at
Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft. That
program — with other far-reaching
activities in the fields of mechanical
design, aerodynamics, combustion
and instrumentation — spells out a
gratifying future for many of to-
day's engineering students.
Engineer measures residual stress in a com-
pressor blade non-destructively, using X-ray
diffraction. Stress analysis plays important part
in developing advanced aircraft engine designs.
The important effects of gases on the properties of
metals have been increasingly recognized. Pratt &amp; Whitney
chemists are shown setting up apparatus to determine
gas content of materials such as titanium alloys.
P &amp; W A engineer uses air jet to vibrate
compressor blade at its natural frequency,
measuring amplitude with a cathetometer. Simi-
lar fatigue tests use electromagnetic excitation.
Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft operates a
completely self-contained engineering fa-
cility in East Hartford, Connecticut, and
is now building a similar facility in Palm

O.K., we're well into the spring se-

of education under our belts. So now
that you have the confidence to conquer

Well, that wasn't too bod? However,
exams become progressively harder and
here is a problem for the history student:
The Mandarin Claus from Siam says
that during travels in connection with
the publication of the works of Fer-Fer-
Tam-Tam (Fermat) he saw in the great
temple at Benares, beneath the dome
which marks the center of the world,
a brass plate in which are fixed three
diamond needles, each a cubit high and
as thick as the body of a bee. On one
of these needles God placed at the Cre-
ation sixty-four disks of pure gold, the
largest disk resting on the brass plate,
the others getting smaller and smaller
up to the top. This is the tower of
Braham. Day and night unceasingly the
priests transfer the disks from one dia-
mond needle to another according to the
fixed and immutable laws of Brahma,
which require that the priests on duty
must not move more than one disk at a
time, and that no disk may be placed on
a needle which already holds a smaller
disk. When the sixty-four disks shall
have been thus transferred from the
needle on which at the Creation God
placed them to one of the other needles,
then towers, temple, and priests alike
will crumble into dust, and with a thun-
derclap the world will vanish.

Now, assuming that the priests can
make one transfer every second, with
never a mistake, how long will it take
before the world will come to an end.
Better solve carefully because your
existence is dependent on your answer.
Everybody thoroughly scared? Well,
here's another little ditty for all mathe-
matic curve setters to solve:
Three men who had a monkey bought
a pile of mangoes. At night one of the
men came to the pile of mangoes while
the others slept and, finding that there
many to be divided evenly by three, so
he tossed the extra mango to the monkey,
took one third of the remainder, and
returned to sleep. After a while the third
rose also, and he, too, gave one mango
to the monkey and took away the num-
ber of whole mangoes which represented
precisely one third of the rest.
Next morning the men got up and
went to the pile. Again they found one
too many, so they gave one to the monkey
and divided the rest evenly. What is the
least number of mangoes with which
this can be done?

FaMe no. 2: An MEs Lament
by LARRY SAVAGE
The room was dimly lit, the atmos-
phere thick with smoke and the
musky odor of perfume and alcohol.
Sensuously cool music filtered through the
party-made haze, and undertones of a
quiet crowd supplied a rhythmic beat to
the music.
I saw her draped over the makeshift
bar, her head buttressed up by her elbow
on the bar top, and hand spread under
her chin. Her other hand was coiled
loosely around an empty beer bottle. A
cigarette dangled limply from her mouth
as if it were glued to her lower lip. She
was wearing a heavy grey crew-neck
sweater and a tight black tweed skirt.
I lit up a Marlboro, being careful to
make sure no one noticed the absence of
a tattoo on my hand. Taking a quick
drag, I walked over to her, slowly ex-
haling a stream of smoke in the process.
"Nice party," I said casually.
She looked up at me blankly, looking
through me more than at me. "Whatsa-
matter—you on the make or something?"
she replied.
"Forget it," I answered, and started
to walk away.
As I turned she grabbed my arm and
pulled me back to the bar. "You wanna
dance?" she asked. Her voice was soft
and rather husky, and seemed to fit her
perfectly. She picked up the empty beer
bottle, put it to her lips, and tried to
rip off a couple of slugs.
"Ugh, lousy stuff," she groaned, wip-
ing the back of her hand across her
mouth, and making a face as if she'd
just swallowed a shot of vinegar. "Let's
dance."
She clung to me like frosting on a
cake and I soon became oblivious as to
whether there was music playing or not.
We didn't move our feet, but rather
shook slowly from side to side in tempo
with the music that we occasionally
heard or thought we heard.
"Nice party," I said to her.
"The same as all the rest," she replied.
"The same people, the same lousy beer,
the same music, and the same hungry
looking faces. All except you, Angel,"
she added.
"Whose party is this?" I asked.
"I dunno," she said. "I was sitting
in the Union cafeteria when a couple of
guys I know came up and said they were
going to a party and would I like to
come. It's been like this every night this
week: different places, but same party.
You know, I can't stand the Union,
but I meet a lot of interesting people."
She lifted her face up at me and her
lips brushed mine. She clung a little
tighter and I kissed her long and thor-
oughly.
"Nice party," I repeated.
"The same as all the rest," she replied.
"My name's Larry," I said. "What's
yours?"
Just then there was a tap on my
shoulder and someone mumbled some-
thing about cutting in. Again I kissed
the lips that were up to mine. The
tapping on my shoulder finally stopped
and whoever it was that was going to
cut in gave up and walked away.
"My name is Gilda," she replied soft-
ly, a couple of minutes later. "Before
you ask, I'm in Lit school, I live on the
hill, and no, I'm not doing anything
Saturday night."
"Now who's on the make?" I laugh-
ingly asked.
"I think I'd like some more of that
lousy beer," she replied.
We walked over to the bookshelf-
turncd-bar and picked up a couple of
bottles.
"Are you a student?" she asked.
"Engine school," I answered.
For a long time we sat looking at each
other. Outside of her eyes being very
glassy and tired looking, she was ob-
viously quite beautiful. Her long red hair
seemed to enclose her face like a flaming
halo, and her smile was warm and
beckoning, making her face light up with
a red glow.
"Let's dance," she said again.
As I got up I almost tripped over
someone spread out on the floor, appar-
ently passed out.
"I think that's the guy whose party
this is," she laughed.
This time our dance was even more
intimate than before. I couldn't hear any
music this time, but it didn't make any
difference.
After a couple of hours the crowd
began to thin down, until only about
forty people were left jammed into the
small apartment. The atmosphere was
even dimmer than before, and the smoke-
thicker.
"What time is it, Angel?" she asked
later, after almost everyone else had left.
I looked at my watch, but in the
darkness couldn't make out the time. I
don't know," I said, "It must be around
3 o'clock."
"Oh," she said sadly, "I really must
leave."
"Gil, I've got to see you again," 1
insisted. "How about Saturday night.-'
She wound her arms tightly around my
neck and kissed me for what seemed like
eternity.
"I'm sorry," she finally replied, "But I
never go out with engineers."

of a new profession — nuclear engineer-
ing. While the work of the scientists and
engineers in their own fields is still in-
valuable to the reactor programs, the
nuclear engineer is needed to give an
overall design to the work. Using the
separate skills of these people, the nuclear
engineer integrates these skills into a
final product, much the same as the
symphony conductor utilizes the special-
ized powers of individuals on the orches-
tra to produce the final whole symphony.
A natural conclusion from the above
is the concept of the planetary- engineer.
This hypothetical person would have rhe
task of intelligently integrating the in-
dividual scientific and engineering pro-
posals for planetary survival into a single
practical plan. His duties would carry
him far and wide throughout the domain
of scientific and engineering knowledge
almost to the danger point of being
"Jack-of-all-trades and master of none."
His formal training would be arduous
and long but his rewards in terms of
scientific competence would be com-
mensurably great. In spite of the diffi-
culties to be encountered, there would no
doubt be a few hardy souls capable and
willing to complete the rigorous educa-
tion necessary for a degree in planetary
engineering if only for the glamour of
working in such a field. (The glamour
would be enhanced, no doubt, by the
monetary rewards available to such a man
living in this proposed highly technical
society of the future.)
Of course, all of the above may sound
farfetched. However, concepts more
strange than that of the planetary engi-
neer have successfully become practical
in science. One should at least admit the
possibility of the planetary engineer and
when returning to college as an "old
grad" twenty years hence, not look stupe-
fied when overhearing fragments of con-
versation as "I flunked PE 5 and went
to talk to my adviser about switching
to psychology because . . . ."
In the meantime, we must look forward
to the day when the phrase "blast you
off the face of the earth" refers to
interplanetary rocket launching, and no?
nuclear reprisals.

Expansion is the major reason.
In 1957, for example, sales at
DuPont were nearly two billion
dollars. Four new plants were being
built. New research programs were
being launched. New products were
moving into the production and
marketing stages. Engineers and
scientists of all kinds work in 75
Du Pont plants and 98 laboratories
in 26 states All of this tends to
broaden opportunities for the young

PERSONALIZED
TRAINING
by
F. L Johns
Du Pont
Representative
When you join Du Pont as a
scientist or engineer, you re
given an actual project assign-
ment almost at once and begin
to learn your job by doing it.
That's the essence of our train-
ing philosophy at Du Pont.
Our objective is to give you
responsibility at the outset and
qualify you quickly for more,
because the more we grow, the
more we need trained leaders.
Although there is no one
training program at Du Pont
(each of our many depart-
ments runs its own), all have
several basic features in com-
mon. All are personalized—
tailored to the new mans back-
ground and interests. All in-
volve close supervision on an
informal, day-to-day basis.
And all permit periodic evalu-
ation of the new man.
This flexible system helps
the new man to move ahead
according to his abilities. He
gets to know Du Pont and his
job quickly. He gets a head-
start on future responsibility.
You probably have questions
about this program and how
you'd fit into it. I'll be glad to
try to answer them when I visit
your campus. Why not sign
up for a Du Pont interview at
your placement office now?

Means More Security,
Greater Real Income
To Young Graduates
Du Pont believes that the employee
builds his own job security by the
way he does his work, by his contri-
butions to the progress of the Com-
pany and by his readiness to accept
responsibility.
But Du Pont meets the employee
more than halfway with a program
of benefits designed to help him as
he advances.
Your employee benefits go to work
the day you join the Company. They
grow and build equity for you as the
years go by. Vacations, life insurance,
group hospital and surgical coverage,
accident and health insurance, pen-
sion and bonus plans are all part of
the program.
Let's look at a special example, the
Thrift Plan. You become eligible for
it after one year with the Company.
For each dollar you invest in U. S.
Savings Bonds, the Company contrib-
utes twenty-five cents toward the pur-
chase of Du Pont common stock in
your name. Roughly 65 per cent of
the Company's 90,000 employees are
now participating in the plan.
When you're deciding on a career,
security is only one consideration.
But it's an important one to you and
your family. At Du Pont, security is
a bright part of the future awaiting
the college graduate.
More than 700 of the some 1100
degree-granting colleges and universi-
ties in the U. S. are represented at
Du Pont. Of these 700, more than half
are the smaller liberal arts colleges.

The overhead cam is a boon to the auto in-
dustry, but several major problems block its
widespread use.
by DALE THIEL, '58E
Have you ever wondered what factors
influence automobile designers to
accept or reject ideas for changes in the
present automobile engine? In the post-
war years, there have evolved many en-
gine changes which demanded consider-
able investigation before being accepted
and perfected. One of the most outstand-
ing overall changes was the development
and production of high power, highspeed
automobile engines. These engines were
produced commercially only after the de-
sign engineers solved such problems as
accurate timing devices, needed because
of the high speed of the engine, and pre-
cision manufacture of parts, in order to
keep the engine running smoothly and
quietly. One of the more recent plans for
change, which is still in the experimental
stage, is an idea employing overhead
cams. These overhead cams would make
unnecessary the use of valve springs, thus
preventing spring surge and failure. The
use of much higher accelerations in con-
trolling the valves, the present accelera-
tions being limited by the valve springs,
high accelerations would also result and
permit development of greater engine
power. However, unless the present inter-
nal combustion engine undergoes radical
changes within the next few years, the use
of overhead cams for valve control will
create many problems and disadvantages.
Overhead cams necessitate the design of a
new arrangement for the valves and spark
plugs in the cylinder. They would also
make necessary a longer connection to
drive the cam shaft from the crank shaft
and the use of two cam shafts instead of
one.
Overhead Cam Design
Most of the present automobile engines
are of the overhead valve type with a
somewhat consistent design of the com-
bustion chamber and location of the
valves and spark plug. However, overhead
cams would complicate the present cylin-
der design and would require re-arrange
ment of the valves and spark plug in the
combustion chamber. Presently, the cam
shaft is located near the bottom of the
engine block and extending from the
cams on this shaft are a pair of push rods
one pair for every cylinder, controlling
the intake and exhaust valves. As illus-
trated in Figure 1, the push rods and
rocker arm do not take up much room,
thus leaving sufficient space for the valves
and spark plug and permitting easy access.
On the other hand, the use of the over-
head cam would make unnecessary the use
of push rods and rocker arms. The am
shaft would probably be placed direxth
over the cylinders, as shown in Figure 2.

Barbara Anne, a freshman at Welles-
ley, came home to her tiny home town
for Christmas, and hastened to tell her
father who was waiting at the station to
bundle her into the family station wagon,
"Paw, there's something you might as
well know right off. I ain't a good girl
any more." Paw clapped one hand to his
forehead and cried out, "Twenty years
your maw and I have made sacrifices so's
you could go to a smart Eastern college,
and what happens? You come home after
three full months there—and you're still
saying 'ain't'!"
Erskine lounged into the office an hour
late for the third time in one week and
found the boss awaiting him, arms
akimbo. "What's the story this time,
Erskine?" he asked sarcastically. "Let's
hear a good excuse for a change."
Erskine sighed, "Everything went wrong
this morning, boss. The wife decided to
drive me to the station. She got ready
in ten minutes, but then the drawbridge
got stuck. Rather than let you down, I
swam across the river (look, my suit's
still damp), ran out to the airport, got
a hitch in Mr. Hariman's helicopter,
landed on top of Radio City Music Hall,
and was carried here piggy-back by one
of the Rockettes." "You'll have to do
better than that, Erskine," said the boss,
obivously disappointed. "No woman can
get ready in ten minutes."
A patron at the Fountainebleau Hotel
gazed disapprovingly at his daughter's
new bathing suit and remarked, "Shirley,
it's just big enough to prevent your being
tanned where you ought to be!"
Two society leaders in Africa's nob-
biest cannibal tribe were discussing their
marital troubles in the banquet room
one afternoon. "I don't know what to
make of my husband these days," con-
fessed the first. "Don't let that bother
you," the second reassured her. "I'll send
over my new book of recipes."
After two years in the Pittsburgh office
of a big organization, a girl was trans-
ferred to the New York headquarters.
The morning she reported at her new
post, the big chief called her into his
sanctum and said, "I hope you'll be
happy here. The work will be practically
the same as you were doing in the Pitts-
burgh office." "Okay," she replied. "Kiss
me, and let's get started."
"I can't imagine," said an indignant
lady to an analyst, "why my family has
insisted upon dragging me to see you.
What's wrong with loving pancakes?"
"Nothing at all," agreed the analyst,
rather surprised. "I like pancakes myself."
"Goody, goody," said the lady. "You
must come up to my house and let me
show you my collection. I've got trunks
and trunks full of them."
One of the big manufacturers of plaids
and tartans in Edinburgh received word
that his traveling salesman had expired
suddenly in a Liverpool hotel. The man-
ager in Edinburgh wired—collect: "Re-
turn samples by freight and search his
pants for orders."
The learned but unworldly head of the
department devoted to the study of
comparative religions at Harvard invari-
ably asked the same question on every
final examination: "Who, in choronlog-
ical order, were the Kings of Israel?
Students came to count on this procedure
as a sacred institution and prepared ac-
cordingly. Some crabby misanthrope
tattled and, one precedent-shattering
spring, the professor confounded his class
by changing the question to: "Who were
the major prophets and who were the
minor prophets?" The class sat dumb-
founded and all but one member slunk
out of the room without writing a word.
This sole survivor scribbled furiously and
deposited his paper with the air of a
conqueror. "Far be it from me," he had
written, "to distinguish between these
revered gentlemen, but it occurred to me
that you might like to have a chronolog-
ical list of the Kings of Israel."
"I think you ought to stop taking
sleeping pills every night," a doctor
warned an aging star. "They're habit
forming."
"Don't be a drip," she replied. T«
been taking them every night now for
twenty years, and they haven't become
a habit yet!"
She: I saw a Texas Ranger carrying
two rifles.
He: That's nothing. I saw a cowgir
packing a pair of 38's.

SPOTLIGHTS
PROGRESS
Compiled by BOB RUSNAK
Developments in the field of chemistry
highlight the news this month. The Uni-
versity of Michigan has made strides in
the development of boron rocket fuel.
Coupled with this is Bell laboratories
discovery of a new anti-oxide to protect
polyetheylene, the most widely used of
all plastic materials. Also described this
month is an electronic computer for use
in conjunction with nuclear reactors, an
improved flying radar unit, and a new
metallurgical purification process.
Boron Rocket Fuels
University of Michigan chemists have
been working since 1952 on the "ground
rules" for the development of the new
high-energy boron rocket fuels.
Robert Parry, associate professor of
chemistry, said just two months ago that
he and his associates have been conduct-
ing a long-range study of the basic
properties of boron-hydrogen compounds
for the Air Force's Wright Air Develop-
ment Center through the University's
Engineering Research Institute.
Boron fuels have recently been identi-
fied as one of this country's major new
rocket propellants. The Air Force has also
ordered a 2000-mile-an-hour "chemical
bomber" which will use a super-strong
compound containing boron.
Professor Parry pointed out that boron
compounds are made up of relatively
light elements which release far more
energy than conventional petroleum fuels
when they burn, providing as much as
one and one-half to two times as much
thrust per pound. Many of the boron-
hydrogen compounds are unstable ma-
terials which have had to be "tamed"
before they could be put to work as
practical fuels.
Because the compounds burn so
violently in the presence of air or water,
they are prepared and studied by Pro-
fessor Parry and his colleagues in
elaborate vacuum systems. Here boron
hydride compounds are mixed with a
variety of bases such as ammonia under
controlled temperatures and pressures. A
reaction occurs, and the chemists then
purify the product and chart its proper-
ties, all within the vacuum system.
"Our primary interest is in the funda-
mental properties of these compounds,"
Professor Parry said, "If the compounds
lend themselves to use as fuel, that is
incidental. But I think it is fair to say
that work of this nature here and at other
laboratories is absolutely essential to the
development of high-energy fuels."
By charting properties of boron com-
pounds, the U-M chemists have helped
give fuel developers a starting point,
just as U-M metallurgists measuring the
properties of metals at high temperatures
have aided designers of gas turbine and
rocket engines.
In some cases, the U-M chemists
create compounds at temperatures as low
as 140 degrees below zero because the
compounds would decompose at higher
levels. And because of the danger in-
volved, they work with only small
amounts of material — as little as five
hundreths of a gram, or about one ten-
thousandth of a pound.
Polyethylene Antioxidants
A number of new additive combina-
tions which are exceptionally effective in
inhibiting the oxidation of polyethylene,
the most widely used of all plastic
materials, have been discovered at Bell
Telephone Laboratories. These protectants
are up to ten times as effective as
presently-used antioxidants.
Certain substituted thioethers, when
used in conjunction with carbon black,
have been found to gain exceptional
antioxidant activity over their use in clear
polyethylene. Conventional protectants
tend to lose their effectiveness in the
presence of carbon black. The substituted
thioethers are formed by the condensa-
tion of conventional thermal antioxidants,
such as aromatic amines or phenols, with
sulfur dichloride. Alkyl, aryl and hetero-
cyclic thiols and disulfides without amine
or phenolic substituents are also effective
antioxidants when used with polyethylene
containing carbon black. About O.l't
of the sulfur compound with 3ce carbon
black is highly effective in reducing both
thermal and photo-oxidation. The carbon
black, added to cut down photo-oxidation,
accounts for the fact that a great deal
of the polyethylene in use today is black
in color.
The best conventional antioxides pro-
tect carbon black—polyethylene formu-
lations for less than 200 hours uncier
accelerated test conditions of 140X in
an atmosphere of oxygen. Furthermore,
the oxidation process becomes autocar-
alytic—that is, it reaches a point at which
it "runs away'—under such test conJi-

tions. With several of the new pro-
tectants, however, oxidation proceeds at
a slow, even rate and does not become
autocatalytic even after 2000 hours at
140°C. This is equivalent to much more
than 20 years of normal service life.
Some of the new additives, such as
polymeric organosulfur compounds in-
cluding thiols and the polymer from 1,
10-decamethylenedithiol, offer possible
other advantages. By control of the
molecular weight of the antioxidant, its
diffusion rate in polyethylene can be
varied. Also, by varying the size of the
repeating unit in the antioxidant, the
concentration of the active groups can
be changed without necesarily affecting
their diffusion rates. A high concentra-
tion of functional groups in compara-
tively high molecular weight additives
allows a maximum protection over longer
periods of time. Finally, high molecular
weight antioxidants can possibly be added
in large enough amounts to act as
plasticizers for polyethylene.
Dew Line Extended
Two high-flying electronic superlatives
—the worlds' biggest airborne antenna
and most powerful aerial radar—flew
together for the first time (Jan. 24) on
the strong back of a U.S. Navy WV-2E
radar sentinel plane.
The potent new airborne early warning
combination, developed under Navy Bur-
eau of Aeronautics sponsorship, is ex-
pected to:
1. "See" half again as far as any cur-
rent aircraft radar.
2. Reduce "sea clutter" interference
appreciably.
3. Provide radar coverage from sea
level to 100,000-foot altitudes in a single
vertical glance at the sky.
The mammoth antenna is enclosed in
an ellipsoidal (flying saucer shaped)
radome measuring more than 30 feet in
diameter installed high atop the four-
engine military Super Constellation's
fuselage.
Aboard the Lockheed-built WV-2E
for its two-hour-long first radar flight
were Jerome Freedman, head of the radar
division of Lincoln Laboratories of
Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
and Henry Rempt, electronics and arma-
ment systems division engineer at Lock-
heed.
The super-snooper radar unit, desig-
nated the APS-70, has flown before —
but not in operational use with the giant
antenna. Lincoln Laboratories was direct-
ly responsible for basic development of
the new radar.
Powered by four turbo-compound
engines, the WV-2E is an experimental
development aimed at strengthening a
seaward barrier extension of the nation's
DEW line. With up to 31 crewmen,
WV-2s fly oceanic patrols as picket planes
and combat information centers with both
the Pacific and Atlantic fleets.
Developed to Lockheed specifications,
the powerful radar unit is produced by
General Electric and the antenna system
is built by Hughes Aircraft.
Measuring Neutron Flight
Two General Electric engineers at the
Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory here
have developed a new electronic comput-
ing device for measuring, counting and
classifying time of flight of neutrons
from a nuclear reactor which accomplishes
in an hour what it previously would have
taken a man a month to do.
Elmer J. Wade and Donald S. David-
son developed the first all-transistorized
time of flight analyzer for use in de-
termining the neutron energy distribution
of various types of reactors. It contains
256 channels, compared to a device
previously in use at KAPL which fur-
nished only 11 channels for recording
information on different energy range
neutrons.
Employed in reactor development work
at KAPL, the analyzer, through its work-
saving features, has freed highly trained
scientists from routine calculating work.
They can now spend time saved in
evaluating information the new analyzer
provides for them.
Savings in time and labor by the new
analyzer are matched by the space it
conserves in the laboratory. The device
is only 8 inches high, 19 inches long
and 13 inches deep, compared to earlier
analyzer equipment which took up at
least 10 times that amount of space in
the laboratory.
Most of the space-saving came in use
of 293 General Electric transistors in
place of as many vacuum tubes, along
with more compact circuitry through use
of printed circuits.
In addition, the new analyzer uses
only eight watts of power, compared to
two kilowatts needed to operate the
earlier vacuum tube equipped analyzer.
The KAPL engineers said the anlyzer
works this way:
Development of new reactors at KAPL
involves mock-up of various fuel arrange-
ments and accurate measurement of
resulting neutron energy spectrum.

In 1721 Jacob Willem s'Gravesande of Delft, stimulated by the recently
enunciated Third Law of Motion, astounded the Royal Society by
constructing a practical steam reaction car. The vehicle actually moved
several times its own length, a distance of about two meters.
In 1958 the goal is no longer meters, but hundreds, and even thousands,
of miles. Aerojet-General Corporation, leader in American rocket
power for more than a decade, is proud to be a pioneer in

(Continued from page 55)
This is accomplished in a large part
by measuring the time of flight of neu-
trons over a given distance and recording
the number of these neutrons which fall
into 256 different velocity ranges.
Through various calculations, scientists
can convert the velocity of these neutrons
into corresponding energy ranges.
To accumulate this vital information,
a neutron beam coming out of the
thermal test reactor is chopped by a rotat-
ing shutter so that velocity can be
measured. At the end of a flight path of
established length, the neutrons are de-
tected by a counter and the information
relayed to the analyzer.
Information on each neutron counted
is directed into one of 256 channels, each
representing a velocity range. Up to
65,536 neutron counts is stored in each
of these channels.
After the experiment this information
is transmitted over cables to electronic
calculating equipment which punches
information from each channel of the
analyzer onto a separate card.
This information is then fed into a
digital computer for analysis of the data
from the cards and the result is then
automatically plotted on a graph which
shows the reactor energy characteristics.
Purification by Fractional Melting
A purification process for substances
that are difficult to purify under standard
conditons has been developed by the
National Bureau of Standards. The pro-
cess, called "fractional melting"' because
of its close analogy to fractional distilla-
tion, was devised by A. R. Glasgow, Jr.,
and G. S. Ross of the Bureau's pure
substances laboratory to meet the con-
tinuing demand for purer materials in
scientific research. It has been applied
to the purification of 2,5-dichlorostyrene,
which is used as a "potting agent" in
electronic components.
Conducted in a closed, inert system
under equilibrium conditions, the frac-
tional melting procedure is well suited
for the purification of substances that
are corrosive, hygroscopic, toxic, or re-
active in air. It has several advantages
over the conventional fractional crystal-
lization. These include easy separation of
contaminants and convenient purification
of small samples, with a high percentage
of yield.
In general, fractional melting is a
single-stage operation consisting of slow
equilibrium melting of a crystalline mass
formed by slow equilibrium freezing. The
liquid sample is first placed in an
ampoule and distilled into a fractional
melting tube, where it is cooled to a
temperature just below the freezing
point. Beginning at the bottom, crystals
grow slowly from this slightly super-
cooled liquid. During this gradual crys-
tallization, the crystals formed reject the
impurity until solidification is almost
complete. Therefore, the bulk of the
contaminant is included in the crystalline
network at the top of the sample. For
this same reason, the core of the crystal
is uncontaminated while impurities are
found in the crystal periphery.

• Nuclear Engineering — three
articles of pertinent interest to
the engineering student and
graduate.
• Interplanetary Fuels.
• A History of Timekeeping.
• The Life of Galileo.
• Industrial TV.
When crystallization is nearly com-
plete, the tube is inverted and heat is
applied at the bottom. This causes the
crystals with the highest impurity con-
tent—which are then in the lower end—
to melt first. As other crystals gradually
liquefy and flow downward through the
crystalline network, liquid from the
previously melted crystals bathes each
succeeding crystal surface. Since frac-
tions of the liquid arc periodically
drawn off from the bottom, the less pure
material is progressively diplaced by
liquid of higher purity. Thus the final
fraction is extremely pure.
For the starting operation, the glass
equipment, consisting of a frac-
tional melting tube, distributor, and
receivers, is exhausted by a high vacuum
system. Next, the glass tubing leading to
the vacuum system is flame sealed. Fol-
lowing this, the sample is distilled into
the fractional melting tube chamber and
the ampoule, which originally containec
the sample, is removed.
Constant temperature baths are used in
both the freezing and melting sequences
The freezing and melting rates are con-
trolled by using an appropriate bath And
by varying the pressure in the silvered
vacuum jacket. Ice and water slurries
are used for samples freezing above 0°C
powdered carbon dioxide refrigerant for
samples freezing about —50°C. and
liquid nitrogen for substances freezin.:
below —50°C The temperature is reg-
ulated by means of a thermocouple in-
serted in the small closed glass tube
connecting the sample container and the
vacuum jacket.
Crystallization may be induced by
thermal-shock seeding. In this method,
the small amount of sample contains
in the "U" at the bottom of the cell is
frozen by cooling it with either powdered
carbon dioxide or liquid nitrogen. Thus
the first crystals form on the bottom and
then grow upward.
For a maximum pure yield, it is
important that the process of crystalliza-
tion be extremely gradual because this
enables the crystal to form without in-
clusion of surrounding impurities. Slow
crystallization also produces larger crys-
tals. These have a smaller ratio of surface
area to mass; therefore the total amount
of absorbed impurity on the crystalline
faces is reduced.
In earlier methods, the separation of
the mother liquor from the pure crystals
was difficult and ineffective. With the
present equipment, however, the tube can
be inverted, permitting the concentrated
impurity content, which is retained in the
crystals growing near the top, to be
melted and retrieved first. This a\oid&gt;

imately 9995 percent pure.

MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMICS
and SPACE TECHNOLOGY
Magnetic fields, acting as a double piston,
drive luminous ionized shock waves through
transparent tube. One-tenth microsecond ex-
posure in STL's Physical Research Laboratory.
Magnetohydrodynamics provides one of the most promis-
ing approaches for attaining the velocities and specific
impulses that will be required for manned space flight to
a planet, landing, and returning.
The critical problem in attaining velocities of hundreds
of thousands of miles per hour is the containment of tem-
peratures comparable to those in the interior of stars.
Because the temperature of the driving reaction will have
to rise as the square of the exhaust velocity, temperatures
greater than one million degrees will be encountered in
reaction chambers. Magnetohydrodynamics offers a
unique solution to the basic problem of containing the
reaction without contact with the chamber walls.
Briefly, the physical principles of magnetohydrody-
namics are these. Since gas at such temperatures is com-
pletely ionized and is an effective conductor of electricity,
the introduction of currents in the gas (in this state
called a plasma) creates an electromagnetic field. This
field makes it possible to control the plasma by applying
an external opposing magnetic field which creates a mag-
netic bottle to contain the charged gas particles. Similarly,
a magnetic-field piston can be used to accelerate the par-
ticles. Such magnetohydrodynamic reactions are expected
to develop exhaust velocities that are an order of magni-
tude greater than those generated by present chemical
rockets.
At Space Technology Laboratories, both analytical and
laboratory work are proceeding in the field of mag-
netohydrodynamics. This work illustrates the advanced
research in STL's Physical Research Laboratory, which
emphasizes the application of basic physical principles to
the requirements of space technology.
In support of its over-all systems engineering respon-
sibility for the Air Force Ballistic Missile programs, and
in anticipation of future system requirements, STL is
engaged in a wide variety of research and experimental
development activity. Projects are in progress in elec-
tronics, aerodynamics, propulsion, and structures.
The scope of work at Space Technology Laboratories
requires a staff of unusual technical breadth and compe-
tence. Inquiries regarding the many opportunities on the
Technical Staff are invited.

Why Vought Projects
Bring Out The Best
In An Engineer
At Vought, the engineer doesn't often
forget past assignments. Like all big
events, they leave vivid memories.
And it's no wonder.
For here the engineer contributes to
history-making projects — among
them the record-breaking Crusader
fighter; the Regulus II missile, chosen
to arm our newest nuclear subs; and
the new fast-developing 1,500-plus-
mph fighter, details of which are still
classified.
The Vought engineer watches such
weapons take shape. He supervises
critical tests, and he introduces the
weapons to the men with whom they
will serve.
Engineers with many specialties share
these experiences. Today, for exam-
ple, Vought is at work on important
projects involving:
electronics design and manufacture
inertial navigation
investigation of advanced propulsion
methods
Mach 5 configurations
Vought's excellent R&amp;D facilities
help the engineer through unexplored
areas. And by teaming up with other
specialists against mutual challenges,
the Vought engineer learns new fields
while advancing in his own.

tie out first while the finest settle out

Grinding wheels are usually manu-
factured by thoroughly mixing the dia-
mond powder with a metallic powder
and sintering by heat and pressure. The
process must be conducted in an inert
atmosphere because diamonds at that
temperature will readily react with oxy-
gen to form carbon dioxide. Recently
grinding wheels have been made using
phenol resin as a base. In all cases the
diamond grains are used only in the
outer portion of the grinding surface
because of the expense of the grains.
Diamond-impregnated grinding wheels
have been made so thin (0.4mm) that
they are used as sawing discs. Such saws
are used to cut hardened steel, carbides,
gemstones, and even diamonds them-
selves. At a speed of about 6,000 revolu-
tions, a four inch diameter disc will cut
almost five square inches of material
before the edge must be renewed.
Germanium and silicon wafers for elec-
tronic equipment are cut by many such
discs properly spaced on a common shaft.
Much of the demand for diamond-im-
pregnated grinding wheels is due to the
discovery of sintered carbide tool tips
which cannot be ground satisfactorily
by other materials. Thus most of the
diamond wheels are used for tool shap-
ing. Some are used to grind a plane sur-
face on metal parts suitable for further
finishing. Some lubricant, usually a light
oil, is always used with diamond grind-
ing wheels.
Free diamond powder is primarily used
for polishing metal and glass surfaces.
Large surfaces are finished by means of a
lapping wheel with diamond dust spread
on the surface. The powder must be
mixed with a viscous fluid to hold the
particles on the lapping wheel, but some
diamond powder is lost by being thrown
from the wheel. If a highly polished
metallographic specimen is needed, line
diamond dust is used on the cloth polish-
ing wheel instead of aluminum oxide.
Jewels and hard materials are drilled by
means of a steel needle surrounded by
diamond dust.
Yes, the diamond is a very useful ind
valuable material to industry. In fact, the
United States Government stockpiles
diamonds for an emergency just as it does
with gold and other materials. Much of
our modern civilization has been im-
proved in some way by the use of dia-
monds. Although a diamond could be
put to better use, I would still like to
have a flawless stone mounted in precious
metal.
Answers to Technic Teasers
(P. 40)
Logis majors here is the solution to your final.
1. A father and his child, or a paternal uncle or aunt and
his or her nephew or neice. You can reason out who is the
caller and who answered the phone.
2. If you are all thoroughly scared I will tell you the
answer to the second problem and when the world will come
to an end. Because of the enormous size of the answer, we
will have to get a general formula for the moving of the
disks and substitute 64 into it. Take the smallest disk and
place it on needle "I". Then take the second smallest disk
and place it on needle "B". This give a total of 3 steps for
the moving of 2 disks. Now take the third smallest disk
and place it on needle "I". Then take the smallest disk and
replace it on needle "A", take the second smallest disk and
place it on top of the third smallest disk on neede "I", and
then take the smallest disk and place it on top of the second
smallest disk on needle "I". This gives 7 total steps for the
placing of 3 disks in order. Taking the value of 2 steps for
the placing of 2 disks and 7 steps for the placing of 3 disks,
the general formula becomes 2"—1 where n is the number
of disks that have been placed in order. Substituting 64 for
n in the general formula, the end of the world will come,
assuming that the priests can transfer one disk per second
and that they never make a mistake, in 18,446,744,073,709,-
551,615 seconds, or more than 500,000 years. So rest easy,
the end of the world will not come tomorrow.
The answer to the third problem is easy. It is 79. I leave
it up to you to check me on this.

Feedback, the term used in Electrical Engineering to describe the process of feeding
back a portion of the output from an apparatus to its input, has long been known to affect
the performance of electronic and mechanical equipment.
In the years preceding World War II, the design of systems containing feedback was
an art that was based upon a few isolated studies, tempered, of course, by the desgner's
experience. This resulted in much "cut and try" engineering.
As a result of a concentrated effort to develop a number of radar and gun-turret control
systems during World War II, the design of feedback control systems advanced from an
art to that of a science. In recent years basic control systems concepts have been broad-
ened in scope so that present-day feedback control systems may appear in many physical
forms, some being relatively simple while others may be exceedingly complex, employing
one or more special purpose analog or digital computers as part of the system.
The positional feedback control systems or servomechanism shown above is a system
that may be found in the Servomechanism Laboratory. It is an example of a system that
contains an analog computer as an active element within the feedback loop in order to im-
prove its dynamic characteristics.
In the Servomechanisms Laboratory also will be found examples of feedback control
systems that contain electronic, eleectric, eletromechanical, and hydraulic elements within
their control loops.
Students interested in feedback control systems will find it possible to specialize in this
area by taking graduate work in Electrical Engineering.

(Continued from page 48)
and this would allow a direct control of
the valves from the cams. The space above
the cylinders would be greatly limited
since the cam shaft would have to be
placed close to the cylinder block to pre-
vent too much height. Thus, the valves
would have to be arranged differently in
order to perform the proper action and
this would probably necessitate design of
a new combustion chamber in order to
get the necessary lift space. The spark
plug would also have to be moved to one
side, thus causing problems of auto-igni-
tion and knock; requiring a new shape of
combustion chamber in order to eliminate
this fault.
Another problem encountered in the at-
Figure 2
tempt to use overhead cams is the longer
connection required to drive the cam
shaft from the crank shaft. The current
practice of placing the cam shaft low in
the engine presents no difficulty in trans-
mitting power to it from the crank shaft
since the two shafts are located quite close
together. Thus, a simple gear system can
be used to drive the cam shaft from the
crank shaft and also give the 2:1 speed
reduction which is necessary. The gear
system does not cause maintenance prob-
lems and it is also quite compact and thus
does not take up a lot of working space.
However, overhead cam shafts would not
be quite so easy to control because the
large distance between the two shafts
would make it impractical to use a gear
system employing large diameter gears.
Thus, a new power transmitting mech-
anism would have to be used in order to
drive the cam shaft at the required speed.
Such a mechanism would probably involve
the use of two smaller gears connected
by a chain drive in order to perform the
necessary speed reduction and power
transmission. Such a drive would be quite
noisy and very irritating to automobile
owners. The design of a chain drive
would also involve serious problems, as
high speeds and high power transmis-
sion cause rapid wear and impact failure
in chains. Thus, the chain drive does not
appear to be the solution to the drive
problem and at the present time, no other
practical system exists which would per-
form duties required by using overhead
cam shafts.
Economy Factors
The use of overhead cam shafts would
also cause increases in weight and cost
in automobiles since it would require two
cam shafts for most cars. The present loca-
tion of the cam shaft and the use of push
rods makes it possible to use only one cam
shaft. However, since the majority of
automobiles today are of the V-8 cylinder
type, overhead cams would require the use
of a cam shaft over each row of four
cylinders thus increasing the weight due
to the two shafts and also making neces-
sary separate drive mechanisms for each
cam shaft. This in itself is a problem,
since the two shafts would have to be
driven at exactly equal speeds in order to
\ / Figure I
have the engine perform smoothly.
Another problem raised by overhead
cams would be maintenance. Every time
repair work had to be done on the cylin-
der or valves, the entire cam shaft would
have to be removed in order to get at the
cylinders, thus increasing the labor tune
and the cost of maintenance.
In conclusion, overhead cams would
demand new cylinder and combustion
chamber designs, would make necessary
the development of a new drive mechan-
ism for the cam shaft, and would prob-
ably make essential the use of two cam
shafts. Thus, the many problems and dis-
advantages which would have to be over-
come, at the present time, in order to use
overhead cams appear to be too great to
warrant their development within the
next few years.
A short comment is needed to explain
the overhead cams now being used. Over-
head cams are being used in a few racing
engines at the present time where the cost
of production and maintenance are dis-
regarded and where only short time en-
gine endurance is needed, as these engines
are completely overhauled after every
race. The present Mercedes-Benz engine
uses a direct overhead cam to control the
valve and give them accelerations up O
59,000 ft/sec.2 This is strictly a racing
engine, which is still in the experimentii
stage, and is built at extremely high cost.
However, overhead cams for regular
automobiles are certainly not feasible li
the present time. They are truly "prob-
lem cams."

trying to
wreck a train
Railroad trains have been clocked at speeds as high as 111
miles an hour. Most trains on open stretches run on a schedule
that exceeds 60 miles per hour. Isn't it remarkable, when you
think of it, that nobody ever wonders whether the wheels will
hold up? For many years we have made this our concern so that
it would never have to be yours.
To make sure that fast trains will also be safe trains, U. S.
Steel research teams carry on a continuing study of railroad
wheels at the U. S. Steel Research Center at Monroeville, Pa.
Wheels of the type used in high-speed service are subjected to
the toughest trials which can be administered on the world's
largest inertia dynamometer. Here wheels are driven at speeds
equivalent to 160 mph, with the dynamometer generating 68Vi
million foot-pounds of energy—enough to lift a 34,000-ton ocean
liner one foot in the air. These tests show us the minor revisions
in design which enable us to maintain the wide safety margin
for the ever-increasing speed of operation. Today's wheels would
provide complete safety at train speeds which are, as of now,
impossible to attain.
This is only one of hundreds of research projects at U. S.
Steel directed toward tomorrow's super products. And research
is only part of the job of making, shaping, treating steel. It's
a big job and we need good people to help us—people with your
kind of training.

FIRST WITH THE FUTURE


Those Faculty Evaluations
About this time every spring students begin
thinking of faculty evaluations. Some years
these proceed quite well, but too often the
evaluation forms don't prompt or allow the
student to give the instructor useful and help-
ful information.
Of great interest to tthe Engineering stu-
dent should be the business of two committees
in the College; the Student-Faculty Liaison
Committee and a faculty committee, presently
headed by Professor Harris, on improving
education in the College. This latter committee
recently completed a survey of both students
and faculty in the College, for the purpose of
determining the criteria held to be important
in teaching by students and faculty alike. The
results are striking; a remarkable similarity in
the thinking of the two groups was found to
exist. Of the original fifty criteria, thirteen
were found to be primary by both students and
faculty.
The Student-Faculty Liaison Committee
(formed by heads of the TECHNIC, Tau Beta
Pi, the Engineering Council, and three faculty
members), is using these thirteen criteria, with
additional suggestions from its members, to
formulate a questionnaire which should prove
to be of considerable value to instructors in
learning accurately students' opinions of their
teaching methods. After the questionnaire is
completed in skeleton form, it will be turned
back to the Engineering Council for printing,
and it should be ready for distribution in early
May.
The members of the Student-Faculty Lia-
son Committee feel that by streamlining the
procedure of administrating the questionnaire,
and by combining the thirteen important cri-
teria of good instruction with suggestions by
the committee members and the best ideas in
past questionnaires, they can come up with a
permanent answer to this perennial problem.
The Engineering Council urges every student
to seriously consider the evaluation and to
answer it to his best ability when it takes
place this May.

Tkomas Henry Huxley...on pure and applied science
I often wish that this phrase, applied science,"
had never been invented. For it suggests that there
is a sort of scientific knowledge of direct practical
use, which can be studied apart from another
sort of scientific knowledge, which is of no practi-
cal utility, and which is termed pure science.'
But there is no more complete fallacy than this.
Wh at people call applied science is nothing
but the application of pure science to particular
classes of problems. It consists of deductions from
those general principles, established by reasoning
and observation, which constitute pure science. No
one can safely make these deductions until he has
a firm grasp of the principles.' —Science and Culture

OF THE MIND
The world we live in is in large part the product of the
scientific thought and accomplishment of the past, trans-
lated into engineering achievements. Whether we continue
to go forward depends on whether the scientific curiosity,
the imagination, the careful thought, and the logical
analysis of the past, upon which today's technical achieve-
ments were built, can exist and flourish in the environment
of the new world.
At Avco Research and Advanced Development Division,
and at other places in the free world, an atmosphere exists
in which the inquiring mind may live and create. We have
the technical assistance and the facilities by which ideas
are converted into concrete accomplishments. Many things
have been done, and infinitely more remain to be done—
the world of scientific thought is unlimited and promising.
From the products of the mind will come the technical
world of tomorrow.

TO NUCLEAR PROGRESS
by MAL WALKER, '58E and GEORGE NERSESIAN, '58E
The key to the economical development of
the nuclear reactor as a source of power lies
in the development of the materials which go
into its construction.
The Ford swimming pool-type
reactor is shown in this picture
from a view that portrays the rea-
son for its strange name. These
young scientists keep a complete
record of all fluctuations in the
functioning of the reactor in order
to gain a fuller understanding of
its behavior.
An important phase of the American
economy is the production of
power. At the present time, obtaining
heat from coal is a major means of pro-
ducing electric power. However, coal
supplies are not unlimited, and the effi-
ciency of the coal-turbine-generator sup-
ply of power has almost reached its
limit . In order to reduce costs of elec-
tricity, which would increase with the
decreasing coal supply, the trend has
been, in the past several years, to suggest
use of the nuclear reactor as a source of
heat, which can be easily converted into
electric power. However, nuclear power
has not proven itself capable of produc-
ing electricity economically as yet, pri-
marily because of its relattively recent
development aand the lack of knowledge
concerning component materials.
Before proceeding further, it is help-
ful to classify the different types of re-
actors, both proposed and in use at the
present titme. There are several systems
for classifying reactors:
a. The reactor may be of the power
or power-breeder type, the for-
mer utilized solely for power
production, while the latter is
used to produce additional fuel
as well.
b. Reactors are often classified by
their neutron energies as either
fast, intermediate, or slow
("thermal") neutron reactors.
c. A homogeneous reactor is one in
which the fuel is in solution form
and thus homogeneous; in the
heterogeneous reactor, fuel ele-
ments are used, and thus the re-
actor gets its name.
d. There are solid and liquid-fuel
types of reactors; these should be
self-explanatory.
c. Reactors are built to be either
mobile or stationary.
The Basic Reactor Parts
The conventional power plant generally
consists of the heat source, the turbine,
and the generator, or similar devices. In
the nuclear reactor power plant, the tur-
bine and generator remain unchanged;
it is the heat source which is revised.
In the heat source ,or reactor, are several
basic components, some of which are
absent in some types of reactors.
The first requirement of all reactors is
the fuel, which is usually given a pro-
tecttive metal coating or cladding, except
in homogeneous reactors, where the fuel
is in the form of cither a solution or
a fine dispersion. The three presently
used fuel are Uranium-235, Uranium-
233, and Plutonium-239.
All reactors utilize a coolant to carry
the heat from the core, where the fission
take place; commonly used coolants are
water, sodium, sodium-potassium alloys,
and occasionally air.
Moderators are employed in all reactors
except the fast-neutron type, for the pur-
pose of slowing down the neutrons from

the reacton; the moderator thus serves
for an effective control over the reaction.
Reflectors are used to prevent excessive
loss of neutrons from the core area, and
by doing so, to reduce the fuel necessary,
and thus lowering costs.
Shielding is utilized for the dual pur-
pose of neutron economy and safety. It
surrounds the entire core area and is
the final stop for all fission products.
Control elements normally consist of a
number of cylindrical rods inserted into
the core itself. These rods absorb neu-
trons, thus providing the fine control for
the reaction.
Auxiliary systems, including the cool-
ant cycle and control handling system,
are also directly concerned with the re-
actor and present problems of their own.
Some General Problems
Before discussing the problems pre-
sented by each component part of the
reactor, it serves a useful purpose to dis-
cuss the general material problems of the
reactor.
The most widespread single problem
is presented by the nuclear properties
of a potential material. With the excep-
tion of the control elements and the
shielding, all materials used in the core
should have a low affinity for neutrons;
this is expressed as a low neutron cross-
section, in Barns. Table I lists the ther-
mal neutron cross-section of several nu-
clear materials:

High absorption of neutrons by parts
of the reactor would result in excessive
changes in the parts due to the neutron
radiation. Very few materials possess this
low neutron cross-section, so this limita-
tion dominates others in reactor con-
struction; and materials with satisfactory
nuclear properties do often lack the neces-
sary strength, corrosion resistance, thermal
characteristics, and similar properties for
ideal reactors.
A major problem is that of mechani-
cal strength; very few suitable nuclear
materials have high tensile or yield
strengths, as mentioned above. Since the
nuclear properties must be considered
first, the core is often comparatively bulky
due to the relative weakness of the
material in use.
Corrosion presents a considerable prob-
lem at times, primarily at the points of
contact of the coolant and fuel. The use-
ful fuels, uranium and plutonium, possess
poor corrosion resistance against the usual
coolants, water and liquid metals; this
necessitates the use of cladding to protect
the fuel. (This cladding also serves the
very useful purpose of retaining fission
products in the fuel, thus preventing
excessive radiation contamination of the
coolant.) Fortunately, liquid sodium and
sodium-potassium alloys (NaK), and
water, if demineralized, are not highly
corrosive on most piping metals, and the
former can effectively be utilized as cool-
ants. The high temperatures of a reactor
core accelerate corrosion in two ways:
heat itself directly elevates the corrosion
rate, while all parts heated by neutron
absorption must contact the coolant for
heat removal, and thus need further pro-
tection, from the corrosive effects of the
coolant. Shorter life of core parts results

both from the increased temperatures and
from the radiation effects, which are

Since considerable heat is generated in
the core, it is very important to conduct
this heat away from the core, to prevent
softening and melting of the parts. The
fuel, cladding, and coolant predominate
in this respect; all must possess a high
thermal conductivity, since high heat
transfer through the cladding between
the fuel and the coolant must be effected.
A good metallurgical bond between the
fuel and cladding and a high coefficient
of heat transfer between the cladding and
coolant are necessary to carry out the
heat of fission from the core in an
effective manner.
Heat also presents a severe problem
in the fuel element itself. The coolant
keeps the surface of the fuel relatively
cool, as much as several hundred degrees
Centigrade cooler than the center. These
large temperature gradients set up large
thermal stresses in the fuel element. The
available fuels are rather poor with re-
spect to thermal stress (that is, they
possess low thermal conductivity, coupled
with a high coefficient of thermal ex-
pansion), and special fabrication pro-
cedures imparting certain crystal forms
to the fuel have been developed to either
reduce these stresses or to enable the
fuel to better withstand them without dis-
tortion or rupture. Another phenomenon,
related to thermal stress, is creep, also
aggravated by the elevated reactor core
temperatures. Choice of materials, a usual-
ly effective way of controlling creep, is
limited by nuclear properties, as men-
tioned above, but alloying with Fe, Ni,
Cr, Co, Zr, W, Ti, and Mo is permissible
in small amounts and aids in retarding
creep.
Radiation itself produces pronounced
effects on the metals used in the core.
Its effect on the mechanical properties are
strikingly similar to those of cold work.
Tensile and yield strengths are increased
while elongation is reduced; also, the
effects of radiation are considerably
greater on annealed metals as compared
with hardened metals. Table III indicates
this:

Radiation has an unpredictable, detri-
mental effect on the resistance of metals
to corrosion. The effect of radiation on
metals has been shown to be due to
neutrons, since metals are conductors and

THE ATOM
Using the cyclotron as his eye, man is get-
ting a truer picture of a complex particle—the
atom.
by ROGER BARNES, '61E
Below ground in the Randall Physics
Building at the University of Mich-
igan is an instrument which has played
a prominent part in the increase of man's
knowledge of the atom. Known as the
cyclotron, this machine is one of many
varieties of accelerators which produce
sub-atomic particles. From the bombard-
ment of known substances by these par-
ticles, researchers have gained consider-
able insight into the structure of the
nucleus of an atom, and, indirectly,
knowledge of the use of the bombard-
ed substances in medicine, biology, and
nearly all forms of engineering.
Recent Developments
Soon after the discovery of natural
radioactivity in 1896 by Becquerel, many
investigations led physicists to the con-
clusion that the atoms of elements could
be split up by bombarding them with
high speed particles. The first of these
investigations, by Lord Rutherford in
1919, led to the first nuclear transmuta-
tion, or artificial radioactivity. Rutherford
succeeded in producing a particle called
the proton by bombarding nitrogen with
alpha-particles from naturally radioactive
elements. However, since these alpha-
particles have relatively low energies, it
would be more advantageous to be able
to accelerate them, and other ions, direct-
ly. This would allow a control over their
energy since an increase in the energy
of an ion is due to either an increase in
mass or velocity. Since mass is kept con-
stant in a cyclotron, the velocity of the
particle will determine its energy. This
advantage led to the development of a
long line of particle accelerators, of
which the cyclotron, or "magnetic reson-
ance accelerator," has become one of the
most widely used. Proposed by E. O.
Lawrence of the University of California
in 1929, the machine was actually built
and successfully operated by Lawrence
and his associate, Stanley M. Livingston,
two years later. Soon thereafter, the
largest cyclotron in the world outside
of California was designated by J. M.
Cork, professor of physics at the Univer-
sity of Michigan. The purpose for the
construction of this instrument of much
larger proportions than the California
cyclotron was to increase the radius of
the orbiting particle so that higher speeds
could be attained. First built in 1936
in the Randall Laboratory, the Michigan
machine was rebuilt at Randall several
years later by William C. Parkinson and
P. V. C. Hough, professors of physics.
The basic components of the Lawrenu
cyclotron design are two semi-circular
electrodes, called "dees" because of their
resemblance to the alphabet letter "D'
Unlike the common electrodes in an elec-
tric outlet, the cyclotron electrodes are
the halves of a large disk, several inches
high and many feet in diameter. Tries
may be best illustrated as a hollow pill
box that has been cut in half aloru; a
diameter and separated slightly (see
cyclotron diagram). Encasing the dees
is a highly evacuated chamber, similar to
a vacuum chamber, supported between
On of the seldom-seen components of the cyclotron is this chamber which is use*
for the bombardment of particles at well-defined energies. This apparatus is
located in a room adjoining the cyclotron proper.

ponents of the cyclotron; two semi-

the north and south poles of a huge
electromagnet. Surrounding the entire
structure are water tanks to protect the
operators from radiation.
Method of Operation
Located just below the dee structure
of the cyclotron is a tungsten filament
which when heated will radiate elec-
trons. These electrons are injected into
the dee structure midway between the
two dees where they bombard a quantity
of gas such as hydrogen, deuterium, or
helium. Each posititve ion that is pro-
duced by the bombardment is immedi-
ately attracted toward the dee which is
negatively charged, executing within the
hollow or "electric-field-free space" of
that dee a circular orbit due to the force
exerted by the electromagnet. This force
will be described in greater detail in the
next paragraph. If the dees are connec-
ted to form part of an oscillating cir-
cuit of just the right frequency, their
polarity, or charge will be reversed by
the time the ion has reached the gap
between the two dees after one-half
revolution. The ion, therefore, will be
attracted and accelerated toward the
other dee. Since the velocity of the ion
will increase due to this acceleration, the
radius of its orbit will correspondingly
increase. Therefore, it will trace out a
spiraling orbit, moving farther out in
the gap. After successive changes in
polarity and a resulting spiraling orbit,
the ion will finally arrive at the outside
wall of the dee. Here it is attracted
toward a negatively charged curved plate,
known as the deflector, at a point where
the edge of the dee has been cut away.
The ion is thus drawn out of the dee
and focused through a slit, or the "sep-
tum," into a target chamber. It is within
this chamber that the ion bombards other
stationary substances.
An interesting feature in the cyclo-
tron's design is that the particle will
travel in circular orbits within the hol-
low space of the dees. Very simply, the
reason behind this can be explained by
applying the "left hand rule" of ele-
mentary physics. While imagining your
left hand to be between the two poles of
the electromagnet, point the thumb in
the direction of the north pole. The
direction and path of the particles is
represented by the direction in which
your curved fingers are pointed. It is,
therefore, evident that if the north-
seeking pole is on top, the particle will
travel around in a counterclockwise direc-
tion.
In order to more fully understand the
operation of a cyclotron, we may imagine
a particle to be injected midway between
the two dees at point A in the cyclotron
diagram. It will immediately be attracted
to the negatively charged dee, following
a circular path within the dee due to the
magnetic field of the electromagnet. At
the time when it again reaches the gap
between the two dees at point B, the
polarity of the dees has changed so that
dee 1 is now negative. Therefore, as it
crosses the gap it will accelerate and
move farther out along the radius of the
dees. After successive orbits, the particle
will reach the outside of the dees at
point C. Since it is attracted by the
negatively charged plate at point D, the
particle will pass out of the dee through
the septum and into the target chamber
at point E.
The speeds to which a cyclotron can
accelerate particles, though less than
those of more recent machines, are still
quite large in magnitude. The instru-
ment is designed specifically for use
with positively charged particles, such
as alpha-particles, deutrons, and protons
traveling at speeds of 3 X 100 cm/sec
as in the case of the Randall Laboratory
cyclotron. On the other hand, another
accelerator, the synchrotron, can speed
electrons up to .9999 times the speed of
light.. At this high speed, there is a
relativistic mass increase which the nor-
mal cyclotron cannot compensate for.

ture on the North Campus of the Uni-
versity of Michigan is an 83 inch cyclo-
tron which will provide very high reso-
lution, or detail, in the energy range of
40 million electron voles (mev). The
energy to which the unit will be cap-
able of accelerating deutrons and protons
is more than four times that which the
Randall cyclotron can obtain.
The medium-energy cyclotrons are used
by physicists to investigate nuclear struc-
ture by studying nuclear reactions that
result from the bombardment of atomic
nuclei by the high-speed ions. It was for
this purpose that the Randall unit was
designed. Measuring 42 inches between
the pole tips of the electromagnet, it
can produce ions having an energy of
8 mev. Though each type of accelerator
has its individual structural peculiarities
and usage, it is to be stressed that both
are extremely useful to the nuclear
physicist.
Widespread Applications
The applications of the cyclotron are
so widespread that it is beyond the scope
of this article to even mention all of
them other than to enumerate several
outstanding uses in engineering and sci-
entific work as well as in medicine. The
instrument's greatest use outside nucleir
physics is in the production of radio-
active isotopes. These isotopes are arti-
fkally-produced variations of natural
elements which are formed when the
elements are bombarded by ions emerg-
ing from the cyclotron. In many cases,
the particles will merely imbed them-
selves in the nucleus of the atoms of the
Two Types of Cyclotrons
There are essentially two accelerator
designs, each of which is used to ex-
plore one of two categories of the prob-
lems of the nuclear physicist. The first
type is employed to discover new and
unusual particles, such as the meson.
These cyclotrons are known as high-
energy accelerators. In order to attain the
tremendous energy needed to produce
particles such as mesons, the speed of the
accelerated particle must approach the
velocity of light. Such high speed re-
quires an instrument of much larger pro-
portions than the Michigan cyclotron.
One such instrument at the University
of California was designed specifically
for the production of mesons and the
diameter of the poles of its electro-
magnet is 184 inches (the measurement
by which physicists usually describe a
cyclotron). To be built in the near fu-

elements, but it has also been found that
bombardment sometimes knocks out por-
tions of the nucleus. These artifically
produced radioactive elements have been
widely used in tracing particular bio-
logical processes in plants and animals.
After the introduction of some iso-
tope, the path that it takes in the cir-
culatory system of a human body or a
plant can easily be followed with a
Geiger counter. In this respect, the iso-
tope is extremely valuable if the living
matter is not to be destroyed. However,
isotopes are frequently fed to animals,
which are killed after a time, and the
portions of the body where the element
was carried can be determined.
In the field of medicine, even greater
potentialities of the particles produced
by the cyclotron are foreseen. It has
already been shown that the neutron is
four times more effective than the X-ray
in destroying malignant tissue. More-
over, isotopes have been used to treat
many diseases of the body; as an ex-
ample, radioactive phosphorus has been
given to patients suffering from leukemia.
Essentially, however, the cyclotron is
best applied in nuclear physics for the
production of high-energy particles such
as protons, deutrons, and alpha-particles.
The nuclei of elements can be studied in
great detail by bombarding them with
these particles. Among present day pro-
jects being conducted along these lines
are those at the University, where physi-
cists are studying nuclei with extremely-
high resolution. Moreover, they are con-
tinuing to improve the energy resolution
of the Randall Laboratory cyclotron so
that further details of the nuclei can
be studied. At the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory near Knoxville, Tennessee,
a new cyclotron has been able to fuse
together light elements to form heavier
ones—a reverse of the usual atom split-
ting process.
Other Noteworthy Accelerators
Though cyclotrons have more or less
dominated the field of nuclear research
for many years, there are currently under
construction or already in operation
many other acceleratiors. As was men-
tioned earlier, electrons have been accel-
erated up to high speeds by the synchro-
tron. Moving inside a doughnut-shaped
tube, these particles can be restricted to
motion within a narrow circle of large
diameter. This is done by varying both
the oscillating frequency of the electrodes

counter inside the scattering chamber.
and the magnetic field; in the cyclotron
the magnetic field was constant. One such
instrument as this is in the University's
Randall Laboratory under the supervision
of Professor H. R. Crane. Two other
accelerators are the Cosmotron at the
Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton,
New York, and the Bevatron at the
University of California. Both can pro-
duce protons having energies of several
billion electron volts (bev).
To overcome the relativistic mass in-
crease that the cyclotron could not com-
pensate for when extremely high speeds
were achieved, physicists also developed
the synchro-cyclotron, which should not
be confused with the synchrotron. With
this machine, the energy of an acceler-
ated particle could be increased to 600
mev. A synchro-cyclotron in Geneva,
Switzerland has already achieved this
energy level while another instrument in
Italy has been using particles whose en-
ergy was one bev.
The latest and most advanced design
for an accelerator is a trillion volt high
energy machine which has been developed
by physicists of the Midwest Universi-
ties Research Association. Its main differ-
ence from other accelerator is that the
particles would be whirled around in
opposite directions and allowed to
collide with tremendous force. Accord-
ing to Professor H. R. Crane, President
of the MURA, a working model of the
"super atom-smasher" has already been
built, but funds for its actual construc-
tion are not available. Should the MURA
machine ever be constructed and placed
into operation, the information that it
could yield in the field of high energy
physics would put the United States far
ahead in nuclear research.

SPACE
A survey of rocket propellant systems which
may open the doors to outer space.
by MAX LEGATSKI, '61E
Atlas, Thor, Jupiter C, Titan,
Redstone . . . these are only a
few of the 31 rockets which are some
stage of development in the United States
today. Most of these are in the first
generation stage, but the launching of
an earth satellite by the United States has
signalled a break through into the
"second generation" of rocketry. Still,
as we stand on the threshold of the space
age, we are becoming severely limited
in one area—rocket fuels.
In spite of the progress made in re-
cent years in the development of fuels,
this is the phase of rocket development
in which we are farthest from maximum
efficiency today. In view of the fact that
2.5 to 3.0 billion dollars will be spent
on rockets by the Federal Government
in 1958, and twice as much in 1959,
we can well afford to acquaint ourselves
with the situation facing our scientists.
The area of research covering fuels,
if loosely defined, can be divided into
two classifications: chemical fuels, in-
cluding nuclear reactor systems, solar heat
systems, free radical propulsion, and
ionic propulsion.
Chemical Fuels
The standard measure of fuel perform-
ance in specific impulse (Isp), which is
defined as pounds thrust per pound
propellant per second. The velocity of a
rocket at burnout is directly proportional
to this parameter, and the height attained
by the rocket is proportional to its square.
The best combination of hydrocarbon
and Lox (liquid oxygen, used as an
oxidizer) yields a specific impulse of up
to 280 seconds; the best combination of
hydrocarbon and liquid ozone yields a
specific impulse of up to 380 seconds
(values based on a combustion tempera-
ture of 3000°K and nozzle expansion
ratio of 20 to 1). Variations of this
system usually consist of variations in
oxidizers. Fluorine, fluoride compounds,
hydrogen peroxide, nitrous oxide, and
certain chlorides are often preferable to
Lox because of their higher oxidizing
energy and/or better handling qualities.
Advantages of Lox are that it can be
produced on the launching site in un-
limited quantities, it is non-toxic, non-
explosive, and low in cost on a tonnage
basis. On the other hand, liquid fluorine
can be shipped only in special double
jacketed tanks, liquid ozone is hard to
handle, and hydrogen peroxide, avail-
able in 80% solution, must be shipped
in stainless steel or aluminum tank cars.

the equipment which they use to deter-
mine the basic properties of Boron-

of such fuels since 1952 under contract
with the Air Force.
is white and red fuming nitric acid, which
is used in portable or storable missiles
and in small rocketts where Lox is un-
economical. Most of the handling prob-
lems connected with this chemical have
been mastered, and its thermodynamics
are faily well understood. Nitric acid,
another fuel, has a lower Isp with gaso-
line than Lox or hydrogen peroxide, but
its lower density of 1.5, plus the quality
of being self igniting with hydraiine
and analine fuels, more than makes up
for this.
All hydrocarbon fuels are in essence
vehicles for hydrogen. Hydrogen has a
potential of two to three times as much
heat as any petroleum, and an additional
potential in that its light molecular weight
means more power. One pound of pure
hydrogen—if its use were practical from
a storage standpoint—would produce
52,000 BTU of heat per pound, in com-
parison to hydrocarbons which produce
19,000 BTU per pound. Liquid hydro-
gen has a boiling point of —424°F,
which makes it almost impossible to use
in any large quantities, since the cool-
ing equipment could weigh as much as
the fuel. There is however a break
through in sight. The National Bureau
of Standards recently reported that by
treating hydrogen with ferric oxide, they
have made a catalyst which can be used
to convert large quantities of unstable
orthohydrogen to stable parahydrogen
which can be stored in ordinary Dewar
flasks. (Continued on pjge 64)

THROUGH THE AGES
Modern civilization, from missile countdown
to eight o'clock classes, is dependent on time.
by DON WITHERS, '61E
Scientists have been bound by it, ath-
letic coaches have cursed it, and
lovers wished it would stand still. To a
group of technical experts at a missile
center time is a series of critical count-
downs; to a lonely GI overseas time is
a given amount of months before dis-
charge. To all people in all facets of
life time is a number of standard inter-
vals between events. Whether we realize
it or not, each one of us daily engages
in the measurement or recording of time,
be it glancing at a watch or clock, look-
ing at a calendar, or simply noticing the
transition from day to night.
Primitive Time Measurement
Primitive man had not developed a
detailed system for measuring the passage
of time because he had no use for such
a system. His was a day-to-day existance
ungoverned by a time schedule telling
him when to do anything. He ate when
he was hungry and slept when he was
tired, not because he followed a ttime
routine.
As man developed through the years,
his awareness of the passage of time in-
creased. Thtis was partially due to the
fact that he is now able to converse in
a type of language which required a time
sense. When asked how long a hunting
trip had taken, the hunter would tell how
many nights had passed since he first
began his trip. This is a simple example
of time measurement: noting the number
of standard intervals which had passed
since a certain event.
Longer intervals of time were measured
either by the month or by the season.
The passage of time in months was meas-
ured by the number of times the moon
had completed its period, and the pass-
age of time in years (age measurement)
was measured by the number of times a
harvest or particular season had come.
Eventually the need for a unit of time
smaller than the day came into existance.
As the class of landowners in ancient
Egypt rose in prominence, the need for
subdividing the day became important
to them because of wage payments. Since
there were no natural methods for tell-
ing time in units smaller than the day,
the Egyptians and Babylonians invented
mechanical methods to take up where
Nature had left off.
Early Egyptian Clocks
One of the earliest timepieces was sim-
ply a cylindrical stone bowl filled with
water. The water slowly trickled out
through a small hole in the bottom and
the hour was read by the level of the
water in the bowl. This method was
accepted for many years until it was noted
that the hours weren't of even length.
The straight walls of the vessel were
evenly marked off, but the speed at which
the water ran out was dependent on the
level of water in the bowl. This nuisance
was corrected by using a second water
clock to calibrate the first.
The Egyptians also had sand clock?,
which were quite similar to water clocks
Sand hour glasses were known, but
larger glasses were too bulky to carry
around.

The Clepsydra, an elaborate water
clock.
The water clock never became popular
in Egypt because it was too cumbersome
and required too much attention. The
need was felt for a simple, light, and
small instrument capable of a certain ac-
curacy. Thus the sundial was devised.
The Egyptians had noted that the Sun
cast progressively different shadows as
it moved across the sky. The sundial
made ue of this property. Sundials were
divided into two classes according to
how they measured time: those which
measured the length of the shadow of
a stationary object ,and those which
measured the angle of deviation of the
same shadow from the axis of the sun-
dial. In fact, many of the pyramids
themselves were so oriented as to act as
huge sundials. Sundials were calibrated
by means of water or sand clocks into
twelve hours (sunrise to sunset). A dif-
ferent sundial was used for each season
due to the changing length of day.
Of course the sundial was useless dur-
ing the night because there was no sun
to cast a shadow. Fortunately, the mo-
tion of the stars furnished a natural
method for subdividing the night. An
experienced astronomer could tell the cor-
rect hour by simply looking at the stars.
The positions of the stars changed as
the seasons progressed, so a table of sea-
sonally correct positions was drawn up
by means of water or sand clocks.
Greek and Roman Clocks
The sundial and hourglass changed
little when the Greeks and Romans be-
came acquainted with them and, in fact,
they have changed little to the present
day. The water clock, however, was re-
fined and became more elaborate. These
clocks, (Clepsydrae) as well as hour
glasses and oil lamaps, were primarily
used to regulate the length of verbose
orators' speeches.
An example of a Clepsydra is shown
below.
The time is indicated on this clock by
a moving pointer which is activated
by an ascending float. Water is in-
troduced into the clock on the left in
an amount greater than that which will
be used in raising the float. The water
flows into the funnel, where some flows
into the cylinder and the rest overflows
at the left. The rate of flow through the
funnel is controlled by an adjustable
conic wedge (V). As the water level
slowly rises, the float rod rises and turns
the pointer.
Early Weight-Driven Clocks
The origin of mechanical clocks em-
ploying gear trains and motive forces
such as falling weights is obscure, but
their evolution necessarily took place
over many years. The earliest known
examples are found toward the end of
the thirteenth century. These clocks were
powered by controlled falling weights. In
spite of the skill of the early clock
makers who fashioned the parts for these
clocks on an anvil, the great friction
in the machinery required that the
weights be extremely heavy (as great as
1,000 pounds).
The weight was attached to a rope
wound around a drum. As the weight
descended, the rope unwound and caused
the drum to rotate. The drum, in turn,
rotated the hand or hands of the clock
by means of a gear train, or going train.
The rate at which the weight descended
had to be controlled or the rope would
have unwound in a few seconds. Brakes
were inefficient because the friction nec-
essary to slow down the descent of the
weight quickly wore away the metal and
made the clock progressively gain time
as the brake failed.
The Pendulum and the Escapement
A mechanical method for regulating
the speed at which the weight fell was
clearly needed. Thus the escapement was
invented, which will be explained shortly.
Another important discovery in the field
of clockmaking is that of the pendulum.
Galileo first noticed that the swing of a
pendulum is nearly isochronic (iso-
chronic—equal time), or the time of
oscillation is nearly independent of the
length of the arc through which it swings.
This is not completely true, but the un-
equalizing effect is negligible with a small
arc of swing. The discovery of the pen-
dulum offered a simple and effective way
to operate the escapement. Below is a
simple type of pendulum and escapement
such as might be found in a modern
clock.
The toothed wheel in the illustration is
being pulled in the direction indicated
by the indirect action of the falling
weight. The escapement, which is se-
cured to the top of the pendulum, con-
sists of two arms ending in small hooks
which alternately engage the teeth of the
wheel. When the pendulum is at the
extreme right of itts oscillation, the left
arm of the escapement presses against
tooth 1 and prevents the wheel from
turning. As the pendulum swings to the
left, the left arm of the escapement rises,
releases tooth 1, and the wheel starts to
turn . The right arm, meanwhile, is des-
cending in the path of tooth 2. When
the pendulum has reached the extreme
left of its oscillation, the right arm of
the escapement is against the front of
tooth 2, preventing the wheel from turn-
ing, On the next swing, the left arm of
the escapement descends in the path of
tooth 3, again checking the movement
of the wheel. The effect is that the wheel
rotates the distance of one tooth per
complete oscillation of the pendulum.
The time of oscillation of the pendu-
lum could be adjusted by lengthening it,
and these clocks were fairly accurate.
They were not accurate enough, however,
to be affected by thermal expansion and
contraction of the pendulum.
Many of these early clocks had simple
striking mechanisms which enabled the
hour to be struck on a bell or chime.

are good examples of elaborate and
intricate mechanisms within a timepiece.
The small spheres on top the clocks rep-
resent the earth, sun, and moon revolv-
ing about each other and rotating on
their axis at rates proportional to the
actual movements of these heavenly
bodies.
Unlike modern clocks, many of the strik-
ing mechanisms were entirely separate
from the clock itself and had to be kept
in phase with the clock. The driving
mechanism for the striking train was very
similar to that of the actual clock.
Spring Driven Watches and Clocks
Clocks had improved much in accu-
racy and compactness by the sixteenth
century, but people couldn't be bothered
by carrying even a small clock. The com-
mon timepiece was a pocket sundial and
a compass to orientate the sundial. The
available clock mechanisms could have
been adopted for watches, but a small
enough source of power was lacking.
About 1500, the mainspring was invented
in Nuremburg, Germany, which enabled
A Bimetallic Compensation Balance.
pocket watches to be constructed. The
earliest watches were made in the town
of Nuremburg and came to be known
as Nuremberg Eggs because of their
shape. It was unusual for one of these
watches to be less than fifteen minutes
off per day, due to faults in the ma-
chinery and to the fact that the main-
spring progressively delivered less power
as it unwound. This is not a problem
in modern watches due to efficient escape-
ments, but spring driven clocks are no-
ticeably affected.
The difference of power was compen-
sated for by using a fusee.
The mainspring is contained in drum
C and its pressure causes the drum to
turn to the left, unwinding the cord B.
As cord B unwinds from drum A, the
drum is turned to the left also. The
watch mechanism is turned by direct con-
tact with drum A. The feature of drum
A is its shape. The curve of the drum
is aproximately a hyperbola, and as the
cord unwinds from it, the force exerted
by the cord acts on a progressively in-
creasing leverage. This compensates for
the diminishing power of the spring. The
spring is wound by means of the arbor D.
Increased Accuracy in Timepieces
As watches and clocks became more
and more accurate, the problem of ther-
mal expansion became more important.
Watches especially suffered from this
variation of accuracy because of their
small parts. The use of a balance wheel
overcomes the problem of thermal ex-
pansion and contraction.
The purpose of the balance wheel is
to oscillate right and left about one turn
in each direction per oscillation. A metal
spring pressing against the wheel limib
the speed at which it rotates, which, in
turn, regulates the speed of the watch.
The rim of the balance wheel is bimetallic
and cut in two places near the spokes
leading from the hub. The rim of the
wheel moves in and out with changes in
temperature and thus slightly alter the
speed at which the wheel oscillates
Screws are set around the rim to make
adjustments.
The need for a highly accurate clock
was especially felt by mariners, who
judged their position by noting the speed
at which they had been traveling and
the time consumed since the last measure-
ment. The correctness of the estimated
position depended on the accuracy of tl
ship's timepiece, which was called
chronometer. The term, while appl,"
to many accurate clocks, is usually
dated with a highly accurate ship's
piece. Even as early as 1760, the B
Government offered a prize of 20,000
pounds to anyone who would build a
chronometer capable of certain limits of
efficiency. The winning chronometer was
able to keep within three seconds of the
correct time each day, a feat which re-
mains remarkable even to this day.

T.V.
NEW TOOL
Long famous for Berle and Benny, TV is now
moving into a vast new field as industry's rov-
ing eyes.
by BRYAN WHIPPLE, '61E
Just after World War II, the television
set began its march into the Ameri-
can home. TV was a masterpiece of
science and engineering; its acceptance
is now widespread, and its effects on our
way of life have been far-reaching.
The use of television, in view of its
remarkable capabilities, is not in any fash-
ion restricted to the home. Now that the
market for home television is nearly sat-
urated, this huge industry is finding many
diverse applicattions for its wonder-work-
ing product in the fields of industry and
commerce. As any reader of science fic-
tion realizes, television can be applied to
observation of remote locations. While
the authors of science fiction have for-
seen TV as a spying tool, in the employ
of dictators, industry presently is adopt-
ing TV, but to spy on operations, rather
than citizens.
Industrial TV Components
This new and growing field of indus-
trial television, or ITV, employs tech-
niques which differ in several ways from
those used in commercial broadcasting.
In industrial television, audiences are
small—perhaps only one man will be
placed at several screens. Therefore, the
need to broadcast (to propagate a signal
in air without wires) is eliminated. Di-
rect coaxial cable connections are made
between all of the cameras, and viewers
within a system. It is perhaps fortunate
for the future of ITV that it is wired
and not broadcast, for the addition of
industrial channels to our overcrowded
broadcast frequencies would strangle the
innovation before it could become es-
tablished. The coaxial cable arrangement
has the added advantage of eliminating
the need for high-power transmitters,
antennas, and trained supervision.
ITV cameras are smaller and less costly
than those used in commercial broad-
casting. Some models cost less than
$1,000. Each camera is connected to a
control device which contains the elec-
tronic circuitry associated with the scan-
ning device of the camera tube, the am-
plifiers, and a channel-selecting device.
The control unit is in turn connected by
coaxial cable to the antenna terminals
of an ordinary home television receiver.
As we have implied, ITV's control
system permits it to feed into the moni-
tory receiver on any of several channels,
so that whatever the location of the ap-
paratus, an unused channel can be
found for the closed-circuit image. Of
course, nearby receivers not wired into
the circuit cannot receive ITV's picture
This basic chain of three units can be
assembled for as little as $1,200. Co-

axial cable for interconnections, special
lenses ,and remote controls are additional
cost factors. All the components are more
or less portable when disconnected, per-
mitting the setup to be installed in a new
location when desired. System power re-
quirements average only 400 watts, and
with good lenses no special lighting is
required (above about 25 foot-caandles).
Types of Application
Generally speaking, applications of
TV to remote observation in industry fall
into six categories:
The First category, in which direct
observation would be dangerous, includes
several applications in which TV seems "a
natural." The observation of destruction
tests is an example. Any human who
should venture close enough to the test
site to obtain a satisfactory vantage point
would be injured by the object under test
upon its failure. The ITV camera can be
well protected, and, with a suitable lens,
it will withstand such forces as might be
delivered by the rupture of a high-pres-
sure boiler at point-blank range. High-
tension electrical systems may be exam-
ined under full voltage conditions with
the aid of ITV strategically located.
Highspeed rotary objects may be observed
in operation when ITV is combined with
a stroboscopic lighting. Nitroglycerine
plants have installed ITV for remote view-
ing of that dangerous substance, and on
at least one occasion an impending ex-
plosion was snubbed by ITV observation.
In the atomic energy industry, cameras
are often employed in handling of radio-
active substances by remote control.
Secondly, there are a great number of
uses for TV viewing in instances where
direct observation is uncomfortable. Mill
and foundry operations in the steel indus-
try often entail close inspection of hot
metals. Even the interiors of furnaces
may be inspected directly, where the
customary procedure has been to look
through smoked glass to prevent the sim-
ultaneous blinding and roasting of the
onlooker. Furthermore, the furnace oper-
ator may have a contitnuous view of his
work without leaving his control posi-
tion. In steel-pouring and casting oper-
ations, crane operators may observe the
flow of metal continuously, eliminating
the possibility of misinterpretation of
hand signals.
The third category involves operations
where it is desirable for a single worker
to observe several points simultaneously.
There is normally no way to accom-
plish this without periscopes or mirrors;
the applicabilities of which are limited.
For example ,a machinst may keep track
of the progress of two or more cutting
operations; or, in continuous operation, he
may watch the feed attending to the op-
eration of the machine proper. General
plant supervision and entrance guarding
is often accomplished with ITV since one
man can supervise many locations at
once.
Fourth, observation at a great distance
may be the principal objecttive of ITV.
it is often used to report conditions
within storage tanks and to read boiler
water meters located hundreds of feet
above the factory floor. In this applica-
tion it replaces older methods of tele-
metering which were less accurate, or did
not report sufficient data. ITV cameras
can, for example, indicate the exact level
of dry solids within a silo. Various
drawings and objects may be quickly
shown to personnel at opposite ends of
a plant or office by TV transmission.
The fifth category covers applications
where a larger group must obseive an
operation than is normally practical. One
manufacturer of electronic equipment
used television as a means of overcom-
ing the lack of wire models for a chassis
which had to be put in production at
once. A receiver was placed in front of
each assembler, all of whom worked
from the one existing model. Group re-
ceiving of closed-circuit television has be-
come increasingly useful in employee
training also, where it permits trainees to
see operations without danger to the stu-
dent or disruption and confusion on the
shop floor.
Finallly, there are applications for TV
where direct visual inspection is im-
possible. Recently a sunken British sub-
marine was located with a closed-circuit
camera dragged slowly about the ocean
floor in a bathyscope. Aircraft surfaces
may be watched during flight. The small
size of the camera makes it possible to
poke it through long thin tubes or narrow
vessels. An automobile manufacturer has
used ITV to check spring and frame
operation underneath a fast moving car
on a rough road. The camera was slung
under the front bumper, and the monitor
placed in the rear seat.
Specific Successes of ITV
A motorist on the West Virginia Turn-
pike pulled into a long, dark tunnel late
one evening when traffic was very light.
Stopping his star at the road's edge half-
way through, he produced a whiskey
bottle and helped himself to several long
pulls before driving on at the sound of
approaching traffic. No sooner did he

electric furnace control station, 500 feet
away. The furnace operator carefully
carefully avoids high instantaneous power
demands when switching from one
furnace to another, or when placing
another in operation.
Size of ITV Sales
There seems to be considerable con-
fusion among manufacturers of industrial
television components as to the volume
ment to potential competitors.
The best indication of activity in closed-
circuit TV installation is possibly the
production figures for the small vidicon
tubes used in the cameras. In 1956, 1,350
of these were made, a large portion of
which must have been for new installa-
tion, rather than replacement.

A single camera may be used with any number of monitors and with long lengths of cable if sufficient distribution
amplifiers are used as shown here.
At the spin of a dial, each ticket agent
has before him the reservation sheets for
any train or date likely to be requested,
and can advise passengers of space avail-
able in seconds.
In the freight end of the railroad
business, car numbers and initials are
picked up by ITV and reported to the
yardmaster as freights enter his yard. This
has eliminated the need for "mudhops"
who formerly walked down mile-long
strings of cars, copying by hand. Not
only did this process waste train- and
man-hour, but in rainy weather, filling
out a form out-of-doors is sloppy.
A large Tacoma office building has
placed TV cameras at elevator doors, so
that the starter may appraise the demand
on different floors.
A zinc manufacturer is saving $10,000
a year with his simple ITV installation.
His electric bill is based on his peak
power demand, regardless of the duration
of this peak. This method of billing is
employed because the power company has
had to install lines and generators capable
of handling his peak requirements. A TV
camera was placed at the power demand
meter and the monitor located at the
of business they are doing. For example,
as recently as September, 1957, estimates
as to the dollar volume of sales in 1956
ranged from $2.5 to $7 million. Several
manufacturers claim to stockholders to
have outsold the rest of the industry,
while their publicity declares that sales are
disappointing ■— a two-facedness de-
manded by keeping stockholders happy
while not giving too much encourage-
er Specialty Corp., and Radio Corp. of
America, all of whom entered the field
between 1948 and 1950. Today at least
a dozen companies are actively pushing
ITV. Estimates for future growth, as
they average from manufacturers' studies,
call for a 1959 market of $8 to $15
million; for 1962, from $25 to $100
million, etc. etc.

As the atomic age becomes a thing of the
present and not the future, nuclear engineers
are becoming more and more important.
by DIANA ARMINTROUT, '61E
Since the discovery that the nucleus
of the atom holds a vast storehouse
of power, innumerable applications have
been made of this energy. Men of science
in all fields have pooled their resources
in finding new uses for it, obtaining more
knowledge about it, and applying the
knowledge that they now have in the
advantageous use of it. This has created
a large demand for people in all phases
of engineering and science with the abil-
ity to work with this power.
Reactors must be designed and facilities
constructed to both handle the radioactive
materials and utilize the power obtained
from them. This falls into the realm of
engineering, for it is the engineer who
must carry out these essential operations.
In view of this, the University of Mich-
igan, along with several other schools in
the United States, has established a
nuclear engineering degree program.
The field of nuclear energy requires
the talent of all types of engineers.
Electrical engineers are needed to design
the. complicated electronic mechanisms
which are an integral part of the reactor's
system; Metallurgists are needed to de-
velop new materials for the facilities;
and chemical engineers are needed to
extract the fuels, as just a few examples.
Teams of men from all branches of the
engineering profession work together in
order that this new tool shall serve man.
Since many types of engineers are neces-
sary to the development of atomic power,
the University of Michigan has not found
it advisable at this time to introduce an
undergraduate program in nuclear engi-
neering. Therefore, the program is now
confined to the graduate level, with Mas-
ter of Science in Nuclear Engineering,
and Ph.D. degrees being offered.
The curriculum at Michigan, although
small, is the largest and best equipped
of its kind in the United States. This
year there are about 100 graduate stu-
dents in the department who are working
towards degrees, and another 100 stu-
dents who are taking some of the courses
which are offered, but do not intend to
earn degrees in the program. The depart-
ment, headed by Professor Henry J. Gom-
berg, also boasts a staff of 16 which is
working full or part time in the program.
Compared to the other programs
offered by the University of Michigan,
this may seem limited in size. However,
it must be remembered that the fact that
the University has the responsibility of
training men to be both able and compe-
tent in a highly complicated field neces-
sitates a small, selective group. It is
willing to accept graduate students with
any recognized engineering degree, but
the achievement level must be high. Rath-
er than expand the program, the Uni-
versity feels that it is in the best interest
to allow it to remain the size that it is
now. Hence, it will in all probability
become more competitive as time goes on
considering that interest in the field in-
creases each year.
The entire field of nucleonics is rela-
tively new and so it is with this depart-
ment. The first courses were offered in
1947, and it continued in this manner

until 1952 when the degree program was
officially organized.
Most of the department's facilities are
on the newly developed North Campus.
Within the Phoenix Memorial Building
lies the Ford Nuclear Reactor which was
put into operation in 1956. This reactor
along with many other facilities, is avail-
able for student use. These enable the
University of Michigan to offer more
equipment for the use of students than
any other school in the United States. A
high level cobalt radiation source is pro-
vided for deeper studies into the secrets
of radiation. Caves equipped with huge
but delicate remote controlled "hands"
handle the intensely radioactive materials.
Chemistry laboratories are available for
the study of moderate and low activity
materials, and other laboratories are pro-
vided for the purpose of instrumentation
and measurement. Soon, the department
will have an analog computor for the
solving of complicated problems. There
is no other school in the United States
where students have before them such a
wealth of equipment with which to ob-
tain the knowledge and proficiency re-
quired of a good nuclear engineer.
It is important that students in a cur-
riculum such as this have the equipment
available to them with which they will
be working with after they are graduated.
A man must know a reactor like the palm
of his hand if he is to be able to design
an improved model some day. Therefore,
it is to his best advantage if he has
access to the best tools available for learn-
ing, and the University of Michigan has
been able to supply him with these.
What will these graduates do with their
knowledge once they have obtained their
degrees? Some, undoubtedly, will go into
the field of designing nuclear reactors.
Turning on the power of a nuclear re-
actor is not like turning on the family
television set. The operator must know
what is happening every moment in his
instrument, and be able to interpret at
a glance every slight inflection of a
needle. Upon his knowledge of precisely
what he is doing, rests his own safety,
the safety of not only those in his present
vicinity, but nearby areas as well, and
millions of dollars. He must be a tech-
nician, yes; but he must of necessity also
be a shrewd, careful scientist who has an
instinctive feel for the power which he
is controlling.
In order that there be reactors to pro-
vide power, men are needed to design
them. The reactors to today are by no
means perfect, and so it is a ceaseless
job to find ways in which they can be
improved —- to make them safer, smaller,
or less expensive. If planes are to ever
fly under nuclear power, the reactors must
be smaller and more efficient than they
are now, especially where shielding is

of the Nuclear Engineering Curriculum.

ample of the type of problem facing the
designers of reactors. Many little diffi-
culties face them which may be sur-
mounted by the hard, concentrated think-
ing of designers. A designer must be an
exceptional kind of person: one who
can work with the theoretical and the
practical to blend them into one worth-
while result.
Other men will study the effects of
radiation. It is the task of the chemists
and biologists to determine exactly what
effects the hazardous rays produce, but
it is the engineer's job to design pro-
tective devices against them. Great depths
of watc and thick shields of lead are
now being used, but more efficient devices
may one day be developed by nuclear
engineers who seek to alleviate the dang-
ers of the deadly radiations.
The design and construction of radia-
tion facilities is another phase open to
graduates in this department. The remote
control laboratories must be designed
with complicated equipment to protect
the personnel. Acquaintance with the
source of radiation is required of the
designer, as well as engineering skill. A
combination of the two is found in the
nuclear engineer.
When the University of Michigan
graduates an engineer, it is in effect say-
ing that he is fuly capable of operating
the necessary devices and handling the
materials. This is a grave responsibility.
Therefore, the school must be careful
to ascertain he has the ability to do this.
This makes the requirements difficult to
meet, but not impossible. The Atomic
Energy Commission is promoting the
nuclear engineering programs throughout
the country by offering fellowships to
exceptional students. A.E.C. money is
also being used to assist the colleges in
presenting the program. The fellowships
give opportunities to students who have
the ability to become outstanding nuclear
engineers.
Everyone wants "good" nuclear engi-
neers: Not mediocre ones, but men who
are capable scientists as well as engineers.
The nuclear engineering curriculum at
the University of Michigan is small, but
it is devoted to the graduation of compe-
tent nuclear engineers.
This instructor indicates and describes on a sectional model of the Ford Reactor
the various components of the structure.

are affected only by neutral particles. The
collison of neutrons in a reactor core
with metallic atoms results in disturbances
to the crystal lattice of the metal which
cause not only the above cold work
effects (Table III), but also dimensional
and density changes and their associated
stresses, too often quite severe.
Material purity becomes very important
in particular component materials, where-
even fractions of one per cent of im-
purity can greatly alter the nuclear prop-
erties of the material. Zirconium is espe-
cially useful because of its extremely low
thermal neutron cross-section, 0.18 Barns,
while hafnium, a common impurity in
Zr because of the occurrence of the two
elements together in nature, has a neutron
cross-section of 1800 Barns. Hafnium
and zirconium have very similar chemical
properties, and only in recent years has
success to any degree been obtained in
removing Hf from Zr. It is easily seen
that a very small amount of hafnium
raises the effective thermal neutron cross-
section of zirconium to a level much less
effective than that of pure Zr. Another
difficulty of zirconium lies with gases;
zirconium has a remarkable affinity for
gases, which convert it to a brittle, diffi-
cult-to-work metal, even when dissolved
in very small quantities.
Problems of Each Part
It is easier to grasp the problems in
materials of a nuclear reactor if the com-
ponents are considered individually, each
with its particular difficulties, in the light
of the previously discussed general ma-
terial problems.
To begin with, the fuel and its clad-
ding present difficulties primarily due to
intense heat and radiation, because the
fuel is in the heart of the core. Since fuels
are limited to the three already mentioned
(U-235, U-233, Pu-239), all that can
be said about the fuel elements is that
they must be free of all impurities of
high thermal neutron cross-section. To
strengthen the rather long, slender fuel
elements, alloys of metals of low thermal
neutron cross-section (Al and Zr, prin-
cipally) have been successfully used. Fuel
cladding has a double duty to perform:
it protects the fuel from corrosion and
retains fission products. To perform these,
it needs several properties; it must itself
resist coolant corrosion; it must neces-
sarily posses a low thermal neutron cross-
section; and it needs a high coefficient of
thermal conductivity. These properties
limit the possible materials to aluminum,
zirconium, stainless steels, and some
ceramics. Aluminum and zirconium find
widest use, zirconium being employed
when the temperature exceeds about 500°
F. Cladding is most satisfactorily attached
to the fuel element by means of a
metallurgical bond, which results in the
highest heat transfer and a minimum of
radioactive fission products escaping into
the coolant stream. Impurities, which have
a generally detrimental effect on corrosion
resistance, are undesirable (not only in
the fuel and cladding, but in most parts
of the reactor). In addition, impurities
of a high thermal neutron cross-section
(most metals tend in this direction) ire
not wanted in all core parts, except lor
the shield and control elements, where
high thermal neutron cross-section is a
key necessity, because these impurities
absorb neutrons, decreasing neutron ef-
ficiency. On absorbing neutrons the*
impurities suffer the ill effects of radia-
tion, inducing stresses in the parent metal
and lowering its corrosion resistance.
Another very critical component in the
reactor is the coolant. Its most obviou-
necessary property is that it be a good
conductor of heat and possess a high heat
capacity. Also, the coolant should not be
excessively corrosive; Na-K alloys are
not, and purified water is satisfactory
For the reasons discussed previously, the
coolant must have a low thermal neutron
cross-section. Air is used only because ot
its economy, and only in smaller reactor'
Water is commonly used because of to
36
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Potassium Na-K alloys are used most
widely because of their lower pressure
requirements at elevated temperatures
than with water, and because of the rela-
tively high heat capacity of Na-K. A
point well worth mentioning is the melt-
ing point of 44%, Na-K; sodium melts
at 208°F, potassium at 145°F, but Na-K
melts at only 66° F; this of course is
another point in its favor. An example
of a material unusable as a coolant be-
cause of one reason only is liquid fuel,
because of its severe corrosiveness.
The moderator of the reactor also re-
quires a material of low thermal neutron
cross-section, for the above-mentioned
reasons, and a high coefficient of thermal
conductivity. Also, the moderator should
have an atomic weight of no greater than
twelve. This follows from the mechanics
principle which reasons that a moving
particle, such as a neutron, is most
effectively slowed down by collison with
a particle of mass about equal to its own.
For this reason, materials of low atomic
weight must necessarily be used as mod-
erators. But high thermal neutron cross-
sections rule out all possibilities except
hydrogen, deuterium, beryllium, and car-
bon, usually in graphitic form. Hydrogen
and deuterium are most frequently used
in the oxide form as water and heavy
water, respectively, which find great use
because of their relatively high power
to slow down fast neutrons, and low cost
in the case of water. Beryllium, while
costly at present, possesses excellent mod-
erator properties; it has the highest atom
density (atoms/cc) of any element, which
gives it a high moderating efficiency, in
addition to having the necessary atomic
weight and neutron cross-section. It also
has a high melting point, 2345°F, and
low density, 1.83 g/cc, both of which
are desirable properties. It presents some-
what of a problem in that it has a great
affinity for 0, and N2, forming the high
thermal neutron cross-section oxide and
nitride, considerably reducing its moder-
ating efficiency, and is quite brittle at
room temperature. At elevated tempera-
tures, however, its ductility increases
markedly. Graphite is an excellent moder-
ator, because of its low thermal neutron
cross-section, good thermal conductivity,
strength and creep resistance at the ele-
vated core temperatures, and high resist-
ance to thermal shock, a condition en-
countered when starting and stopping
fission in a reactor, due to the tempera-
ture changes accompanying such opera-
tions. As with all moderator materials,
graphite must be very pure — no im-
purities can be tolerated, especially those
with high thermal neutron cross-sections.
This requirement is especially stringent
in the case of the moderator because of
the great quantity of moderator material
very near to the fuel; excessive neutron
loss, with its associated high fuel cost,
would be experienced with even very
small quantities of impurities.
Reflector requirements are essentially
the same as those for the moderator,
since its purpose is that of attenuating
and reflecting neutrons which would
otherwise be lost. Identical materials are
often used in both parts.
An important component of any re-
actor is itts control system, control usually
being accomplished by the insertion of
control rods into the core itself. Control
rods perform their function by absorbing
neutrons produced in the core fission,
thus preventing further reactions by these
neutrons, hence slowing down the overall
fission rate. Obviously, the most necessary
single property of a control rod is that
it have an extremely high thermal neutron
cross-section. Control rods should also
be reasonably strong, to prevent structural
problems. Boron finds the widest use,
because of its extremely high neutron
cross-section, 4,000 Barns, and its high
melting point, 4170°F. Cadmium, also
useful, is more limited because of its
low melting point, 610°F; it is weaker
at elevated temperatures than boron.
Samarium and gadolinium, with cross-
sections of 36,000 Barns, are excellent
control materials, but cost inhibits their
wide use.
The final reactor component is the
shielding. Since its purpose is to absorb
neutrons which have escaped the reflec-
tor and are lost to the reaction, it must
necessarily possess a high thermal neutron
cross-section. But radiation from the core
must also be absorbed by the shield, this
is the major problem. Alpha and beta
radiation is easily stopped by thin sheets,
but the high energy gamma radiation,
the most deadly of the three from a
safety standpoint, requires large quantities
of mass of any type to be absorbed. For
this reason, the shield is often concrete,
to which can be added materials to per-
form the other necessary functions of
the shield. Iron (steel) is useful as a
material for shielding, as is lead; both
are, from the standpoint of mass, and
iron is from the standpoint of strength
at high temperatures. Steel is usually
necessary as a barrier to the heat radiated
by the core. If the coolant is circulated
into the shield, corrosion resistance and
thermal stress must be considerations in
selecting the shielding material. At the
Oak Ridge National Laboratory, boron
carbide, boron oxide, aluminum oxide,
and B-Al were successfully used as
thermal shields. As yet, insufficient work
has been done with water to establish its
usefulness as a shield; one obvious detri-
ment is its liquid state; it can support
no weight, as steel, lead, or concrete can.
Additional problems are induced by
the auxiliary reactor systems, especially
the coolant cycle. Liquid sodium and
potassium must be kept in the piping
with no leakage. Pump and valve seals
present a particular problem because of
the dangerous nature of the liquids if
exposed to the air. Electromagnetic
pumps, with no moving parts and no
seal problems, show promise, but these
require more research and development
to reduce their present cost.
A Summary
The general impression obtained on
surveying the present situation with
nuclear reactor materials is that little
about metals, with regard to their nuclear
properties, is known. There is now no
way to predict the nuclear properties and
usefulness of an alloy from its parent
metal, nor is there a way to predict the
effect of radiation, with any accuracy,
on a metal; these are vitally important
fields where research is urgently needed.
Materials without a doubt now hold the
key to the development of nuclear re-
actors as a practical means of supplying
the world with power.

GALILEO
SEEKER OF TRUTH
Much can be learned by today's engineers
from a man, who by refusing to believe the
"facts," sought constantly for truth and a true
understanding of the world about him.
by MARK POIRIER, '61E
Galileo Galilei.
Born on the 15th day of February,
1565, Galileo Galilei was the first
of seven children born to Vincenzio
Galilei, a poor businessman. Galileo was
born in Pisa, Italy, where he was to
spend his childhood, and later, much of
his life as a teacher. From the first, it
was evident that Galileo possessed much
skill in both the manual and mental arts.
Indeed, his interests ranged from
mechanics, painting and drawing, to
poetry, language, and music. The boy
had much skill for making working mod-
els of the things he saw around him. He
also was quite good at drawing and
painting. He was so fond of poetry, hi
memorized whole works by his favorite
authors: Virgil, Seneca, Petrarch. Horace,
and Ariosto. Early in his schooling, his
talented father added to his store of
Inowledge by teaching him Latin and
Greek. The boy was considered a good
organist, and a beautiful lute player.
38
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


There is no doubt that his father was
responsible for Galileo's great skill as a
musician. Though Vincenzio Galilei was
forced to earn his living as a business-
man, he was a very talented and capable
musician, being a very excellent lute
player, and writing several important
works on music, including, a "Diologue
on Ancient and Modern Music." In his
"Diologue . . ," Vincenzio stated: "It
appears to me that they who in proof of
any assertion rely simply on the weight
of authority, without adducing any argu-
ment in suport of it, act very absurdly.
I, on the contrary, wish to be allowed,
freely to question and freely to answer
without any sort of adulation, as well
becomes those who are sincerely in search
of truth." It is certainly possible that
beliefs such as these, formed much of the
basis for Galileo's attitudes toward truth
and fact.
When Galileo was twelve, his father
sent his to a Jesuit monastery near Flor-
ence, where he received more instruction
in Latin and Greek. After spending some
time there, Galileo told his father he
would like to become a novice. This dis-
pleased his father greatly, who, being
rather poor, wished Galileo to become a
clothdealer, which was one of the most
rewarding trades in Florence. Soon after
this, Galileo became sick and his father
used this as an excuse for withdrawing
him from the monastery. After thinking
it over, however, Vincenzio decided his
son's talents were more suited for science
than business. And so, when Galileo was
seventeen, he was sent to the University
of Pisa to study medicine; this was in
the year 1581.
Proof Demanded, In Search For Truth
Galileo began searching for truth al-
most immediately after entering the Uni-
versity. Because of his unwillingness to
accept the "known" facts, he was dubbed
the "Wrangler" by his contemporaries.
In that day, it was the custom of students
to listen with deep respect to the teach-
ings of the professors, questioning noth-
ing of what was said. However, Galileo
insisted on arguing everything on its
merits. He wasn't content to simply re-
member what was said, but wanted proof
for the assumptions rendered. Though
the young Galileo respected Aristotle,
he didn't let the man's fame replace the
proof necessary to support his statements.
This sort of conduct was deemed almost
blasphemous by his worshipful fellow
students, and it earned much ill-feeling
for the young Galileo.
Galileo made his first important dis-
covery when he was eighteen, only a few
months after having entered the Uni-
versity. As he sat in church one morning,
he chanced to look at a swinging lamp
and noticed that the time it took to make
a complete swing seemed to be inde-
pendent of the distance traveled. After
church, he experimented with a piece of
string tied to a bullet, to see if he could
learn more about this phenomenon. He
grasped the free end of the string and
alowed the bullet to swing, while he
gathered the string in his hand until the
time of swing equalled his pulse. He
A Page from the Past
"In the Future"
"A page from the past" is a
new series of articles that will be
appearing in the Technic every
second issue during the coming
months. It is hoped that this series,
which has come into being largely
through the efforts of Technic saff-
man Mark Poirier, will help to-
morrow's engineers learn from
great scientists and engineers of the
past. It should be pointed out,
however, that it is the Technic')
aim not to present just a rehash
of a man's deeds and accomplish-
ments but to convey to the readers
the man himself; his ideas, person-
ality, attitudes and beliefs. With
this aim in mind the editors of the
Technic feel that in the coming
months this series will be both en-
joyable and beneficial to you, the
readers.
The tailors
then noted that the bullet took as long
to make a complete swing, whether it
traveled a long arc, or a short one. Thus,
the idea of the pendulum was discovered.
Galileo did not become acquainted with
mathematics until his second year at the
University. Though Vincenzio was well
acquainted with the subject, he did not
teach his son mathematics for fear it
would interfere with his studies of medi-
cine. While at the University, Galileo
became acquainted with a special tutor
named Ricci, who was well trained in
this field. It was Ricci who introduced
geometry to Galileo, who immediately
became fascinated with the works of
Archimedes which gave him great insight
into the nature of physical science.
Archimedes had proven that King
Hiero's crown was not pure gold by
pouring water to the brim of two con-
tainers of equal volume, and then placing
the crown in one container and an equal
weight of gold in the other container.
He then weighed the amounts of water
that overflowed, thus showing that the
crown had a larger volume than the pure
gold had, as it caused more water to
overflow. Using this as a basis, Archi-
medes made an analysis of the mechanics
of liquids and used mathematics in the
description of their properties.
Thus, Galileo learned from Archimedes
the technique of combining mathematics
with experimentation to describe the
properties of matter. Galileo realized this
was essential to the study of physical laws
and so stating this belief, became the
founder of the study of physics.
Keeping the methods of Archimedes
in mind, Galileo developed a way to
directly measure the weights of the con-
stituents of a two-metal alloy. These ex-
periments were done so well that his
values for the specific gravities of sub-
stances agree quite well with modern
values.
Simple Experiments Teach Galileo
Many Things
Galileo remained in attendance at the
University of Pisa for four years, during
which time, his father tried without suc-
cess to get a scholarship for the boy. So
at last, with all means of support ex-
hausted, Galileo was forced to withdraw
from the University without a degree.
And so, Galileo moved to Florence to
live for a time with his family. He tried
to earn a little money by teaching and
at the same time, applied for a pro-
fessorship at five different universities but
was refused in each case. Finally, in
1589, the University of Pisa had an
opening in the field of mathematics and
by this time, his work with fluids and
the pendulum assured him of a place.
He accepted this first professorship at age
twenty-five. He was given a salary of
sixty scudi a year, considerably lower than
the two thousand per year paid the pro-
fessor of medicine, medicine being con-
sidered that much more important than
mathematics.
With a steady income asusred him,
Galileo was able to continue his Archi-
median experiments, this time investigat-
ing the center of gravity of various
bodies. At this time, he discovered the
"cycloid," which is the curved path traced
out by a point on the rim of a revolving
wheel.

with some of the Aristotlean doctrine
that previously, he had only questioned
verbally in the lecture hall. Aristotle had
said that two bodies will fall at a rate
of speed proportional to their weight. It
is commonly believed that Galileo dis-
proved this by dropping two objects of
different weight from the leaning tower
of Pisa, showing that, if released at the
same time, both objects would strike the
ground at the same instant. There does
not seem to be much evidence to back
up this story — Galileo did do experi-
ments with falling objects, but his ex-
periments were much more compre-
hensive.
As freely falling objects move too
quickly for accurate observation, Galileo
devised an inclined plane to slow down
the action in a controlled way so that
he could carefully measure what was
happening. Using an inclined plane
eighteen feet long and a "hard, smooth,
and very round ball," he accurately
measured the time the ball took to roll
different distances down the inclined
plane. To time the ball accurately, he
used a water clock, opening and closing
the water spout with his finger and
weighing the amount of water that had
run out during each trial. Doing these
experiments many times gave him exact
data with which he obtained the rela-
tionships between the time, distance, and
speed of the ball on the inclined plane.
Thus, he discovered "acceleration," that
is, the rate of change of velocity.
Galileo also investigated what hap-
pened when a ball with a given speed
was rolled up an inclined plane. He
observed that when the plane was very
steep, the ball slowed down quickly, and
when the slope of the incline was slight,
the ball slowed down very slowly. Galileo
observed that if the plane were level and
the ball encountered no friction, it would
probably travel at the same speed forever.
Each time his research led him to some
new physical truth, Galileo would men-
tion it in his lectures. He seemed espe-
cially interested in those facts which con-
tradicted the reasoning of Aristotle.
Aristotle's doctrine was based only on
reasoning, not experimental determina-
tion, and this shortcoming led Galileo
to sarcastically tear down the tenets of
the Aristotlean physics. Unfortunately,
this debasing of Aristotlean theory created
a great deal of hostility in the minds of
Galileo's fellow professors. This hostility
spread to his students, who heckled and
made such an uproar in hi lectures that
in 1592, he was forced to resign his chair.
While teaching at Pisa, Galileo was
fond of writing prose and poetry, some
of which he directed at University regu-
lations. In one particular prose comedy,
he ridiculed the University rule concern-
ing the wearing of gowns. These and
other bits of writing contributed to his
ejection from the University and also
gave him the reputation of a man of
easy morals, unconcerned with profes-
sional dignity.
Academic Freedom Benefits Galileo
Greatly
Even though Galileo's professional
salary was small, he had always generously
helped his relatives. His father died soon
after he left Pisa, and Galileo went to
the family home in Florence to look after
the family. At this time he also under-
took to pay his sister Virginia's dowry,
which, in his poor circumstances, took
him several years to settle completely.
Being still deeply interested in research
and in teaching about his results, he
aspired to the chair of mathematics at
Padua, in the Venetian Republic, which
had been vacant since 1588. He journeyed
there in the summer of 1592 and suc-
cessfully contested for the chair, which
he obtained for a six year period at a
salary of one hundred and fifty florins
a year.
Thus, Galileo became a professor of
mathematics at the University of Padua,
a post he was to hold for eighteen in-
tellectually active and productive years.
During this time, he made many more
investigations and discoveries in the field
of mechanics, invented a calculating in-
strument called the "Sector,'' constructed
magnetic compasses in his work shop, and
on top of all this, wrote treatises on
military architecture and fortifications.
Galileo's first, six year term ended in
1598 and after applying some pressure
to the authorities, he got his salary raised
to three hundred and twenty florins a
year. By this time, he was a very popu-
lar lecturer, having students from all over
Europe attending his lectures. In the
summer, he was accustomed to eating in
his garden, and always tried to have a
dinner guest, if he could possibly manage
it. It was important to him that the
food be good, and the discussion intel-
ligent. He often entertained himself and
his friends by playing his lute. He was
still very fond of literatture, particularly
Plato's, and still did some prose work
himself.
In 1604, his second, six year term
ended and his salary was again raised
to five hundred and twenty florins a year.
As he was the successful member of the
family, he was looked to for a great deal
of support, especially of a financial na-
ture. By this time, Galileo had a family
of his own. In 1609, he took a mistress,
a Venetian woman of the working class,
Marina Gamba, by whom, he had two
daughters and a son.
Also in 1604, a super nova appeared
in the sky which by itself violated the
Aristotlean decree that the heavens are
perfect and unchangeable. The new star
increased Galileo's interest in astronomy
and he spoke of it in his lectures, noting
that it must be very far away, as it did
not change position with the changing
seasons of the year.

"Since the day we decided to get married, I've been
doing a lot of thinking about our future. It's time I
made a choice on a career. I've talked to the Dean of
Engineering, most of my professors, and to some of the
fellows who have graduated, and you know, they all
said the same thing.
"They all agree that the aircraft and missile industry
holds the best opportunities and the brightest future for
an engineer these days. What they said makes sense,
too, because developments in this field today really give
a fellow an opportunity to make important com
tions on vital projects.
"Not only that, but the aircraft industry is noted for
its good salaries. Generous benefits, too. And advance-
ment in both salary and position is limited only by how
far 1 want to go."
Unlimited opportunities, high salaries, company-paid
benefits unheard of until a few years ago — these
are only a few of the reasons why so many young engi-
neers with a keen eye to the future are choosing the
aircraft industry.
It is only natural that many engineering graduates
should consider joining Northrop Aircraft, Inc., be-
cause the company shares its many successes with evi

New Photodrawing Technique
A new Kodak technique called photo-
drawing is aiding the work of the na-
tion's design engineers.
Photodrawing, or photodrafting as it
is sometimes called, is a technique of
using photograph to convey engineering
drawing information in a form easier to
visualize.
Photographs are reproduced on a trans-
lucent material. To this, engineering
detail and even additional superimposed
sketches can be added. The method saves
both time and money.
This and other related techniques were
presented in a talk by Walter C. Foulkc,
of the Kodak Park engineering staff,
before a recent meeting of The American
Society of Mechanical Engineers in New
York City.
Foulke stressed varied engineering uses
of still photography such as field in-
structions and equipment assembly. The
easy readability of the prints makes them
especially useful in such applications,
he said.
Because of the small cost of photo-
graphic reproductions, they fit in situa-
tions where expense prohibits the use of
engineering drawings.
Foulke said that experience has shown
photographs to be of great value to
construction workers. Time in the field
can be reduced because the foreman does
not have to visualize the end result from
a written specification sheet. He can see
the scope of the project at a glance from
a photograph of existing installations, or
of a model if work is just beginning.
In laying pipelines, engineers have
come up with unusual uses for photog-
raphy. A photograph of the projected
pipeline route can be made into a photo-
drawing and the pipeline superimposed
upon the natural features of the land-
scape. Ordinary engineering specifications
can be included. The engineers can then
easily ascertain the exact location of the
line.

Controlled Highways
Lincoln, Nebraska—The Radio Cor-
poration of America and the Nebraska
Department of Roads have unveiled an
electronic system for vehicle control re-
quiring no special equipment in motor
vehicles.
A field demonstration of the system
was held October 10, at the intersection
of Nebraska Highway 2 and U. S. 77
south of Lincoln.
To highway officials from many states
and representatives of the press, radio
and television, the novel system was
shown detecting and reacting to the pass-
age of vehicles over a specially equipped
320-foot section of highway to cause
these actions:
Operation of lights giving right-of-
way at a point of merging traffic;
Warning a driver when he folowed too
closely behind another vehicle;
Indicating to a driver the presence of
an obstacle in the highway ahead;
Simulating the automatic guidance of
a car along its traffic lane.
State Engineer, L. N. Rees, told the
highway officials that the experimental
system is "an extremely promising devel-
opment that may well mark a turning
point in the nation-wide campaign to re-
duce the heavy toll of accidents on our
highways."
It was emphasized that the present test
instalation represents "a purely experi-
mental step designed to study and demon-
strate the principles" of electronic vehicle
control and evaluate certain features of
the present system. It was indicated that
a logical next step would be the develop-
ment of a more extensive test facility,
such as a complete mile or two of high-
way equipped with a variety of safety de-
vices and including fully-equipped test
vehicles.
The test installation, in the new main
intersection of U. S. Route 77 and Ne-
braska State Highway 2 on the outskirts
of Lincoln, was designed under the di-
rection of Mr. Ress by L. M. Hancock,
of the engineering staff of the Nebraska
Department of Roads.
The system itself, described basically
as a series of electronic elements buried
in and along the highway to detect and
respond to the passage of vehicles, was
developed to its present stage by an RCA
Laboratories research team including L. E.
Flory, W. S. Pike, and G. W. Gray, under
the direction of Dr. Vladimir K. Zwory-
kin, Honorary Vice-President of RCA
The system is based on a concept demon-
strated by Dr. Zworykin and his group
at RCA's David Sarnoff Research Center,
Princeton, N.J., in 1953.
A "Compatible" System
Mr. Ress emphasized that the system is
"compatible" in its ability to perform
many important safety functions on the
highways under present conditions, even
without the installation of special equip-
ment in automobiles.
"The electronic elements which we are
using in these tests, buried in the high-
ways, can be used in their present form
to activate many different arangements of
warning lights and signals placed along
the right-of-way to do many things that
would contribute substantially to greater
safety in driving," he said.
Among the possible present applica-
tions in this category, Ress listed these:
1) Give the right-of-way to one of two
or more vehicles approaching a point
of merging traffic;
2) Warn a driver of the presence of an
obstacle, such as a parked vehicle ap-
proaching in his lane, over a hill or
around a curve;
3) Warn a driver of other vehicles ap-
proach in the other lane, "indicating
whether it is safe for him to pull out
around an obstacle such as a parked
vehicle in his lane."
4) Warn a driver when he is folowing
too closely behind the vehicle ahead
in his lane;
5) Warn a driver when he is going too
fast;
6) Operate traffic lights at insections
"with greater flexibility than is pos-
sible with present techniques."
"All of these can be accomplished with-
out actual control of the vehicles them-
selves, but rather by means of a series of
lights along the edge of the highway
which go on automatically as a vehicle
passes, and remain on until the vehicle
is a specified distance beyond the light.'
said Mr. Ress. "In the case of vehicles
approaching from the opposite direction
on hills or curves, the system can re-
spond to their presence by operating a
warning light or signal placed within
view of the driver from whom the ap-
proaching vehicles themselves are hidden.
"Since these applications require no
alterations or special equipment in auto-
mobiles or trucks, there is no reason why
they cannot be introduced at various loca-
tions in the near future. A logical next
step, but one that will require more ex-
tensive testing as well as the cooperation
of industry and the driving public, is the
addition of simple receiving equipment
in vehicles.
"This step could be accomplished in
two stages. First, simple receiving equip-
ment for indication and warning only
could be provided as a removable unit
upon entrance on a turnpike or pur-
chased by the driver for installation in
his own car. The second stage would be
the installation of receiving and control
equipment as an integral part of the ve-
hicle by the manufacturer.
"With such equipment, the signals gen-
erated by the detecting elements in the
road will control brakes, steering gear and
engine speed to provide fully automatic
driving along entire highways or in spe-
cific areas where it may be advisable for
reasons of safety."
Test Unit Components
The present test installation include*
the following principal elements:
1) A series of 14 sensing elements
buried in the pavement, each consist-
ing of a rectangular wire loop 6 feet
wide and 20 feet long;
2) Associated with each of these loops,
a detector unit which operates a tran-
sistor switch feeding into an antenna
extending back under the highway
past several of the preceding rectangu-
lar loops;
3) Also associated with each detector
unit, a relay activating an electric
light placed at the roadside next to
each of the detectors;
4) A guide wire extending beneath the
traffic lane for the full length of the
test area.
In the first of several different demon-
strations, a car with no special equip
ment was driven over the test area. Its
passage over the detector units lighted
the electric lamps at the edge of the road.
"This test shows the ability of the de-
44
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


and, further, to provide a 'tail warning'
through the detector loops and their as-
sociated antennas buried in the pave-
ment," said Ress. "The driver of another
unequipped car, folowing the first, could
be warned by the lights at the roadside
which can be made to remain lighted for
a length of time that can be either pre-
determined or controlled by vehicle speed.
The driver of the following vehicle could
tell under any conditions of visibility
whether he was approaching too closely
to the vehicle ahead."
Automatic Control is Simulated
Two further demonstrations employed
a specially equipped car to show how the
complete system could provide actual ve-
hicle control. In one instance, a warning
receiver in the car picked up the signal
generated in the buried antennas by a
vehicle ahead. In the car, the signal
caused a buzzer and a light to operate,
warning the driver both visibly and audi-
bly that another vehicle was just ahead.
For the benefit of the guests at the
demonstration, an additional warning
light was placed on top of the car to
demonstrate the action to those not rid-
ing in the vehicle.
In another case ,a special guidance
receiver on the car picked up signals
from the guide wire running the length
of test area. Connected with the receiver
in the car was a meter indicating whether
the car was moving off its course to the
right or left, thus telling the driver what
action to take in order to keep to the
center of his traffic lane. To demonstrate
the effectiveness of the guidance system,
Mr. Hancock drove the test car the length
of the test area with the windshield cov-
ered to cut off visibility. Guided by the
signals from the guide wire as indicated
on the meter, he was able steer a course
directly along the correct lane.
"In both of these tests," said Mr. Han-
cock, "we are demonstrating actions that
would be performed entirely automati-
cally in a fully equipped car. The signals
that operate the warning light, the buzzer
and the guidance meter in our test ve-
hicle would, in the complete system,
operate the automatic devices that would
actually control brakes and steering to
perform the require actions without the
help of the driver."
Compared To Railroad
"Block" System
Dr. Zworykin, who attended the dem-
onstration, pointed out that the electronic
vehicle control system in its entirety
would apply to the highways "a set of
features comparable to the block signal
and control systems used by railroads.'
"Like that system," he said, "electronic
vehicle control may someday remove from
our highways much of the risk that is
involved today because of the carelessness,
ignorance, or sudden physical disability
of the driver."
Mr. Ress pointed out that the system
based on the principles demonstrated to-
day "can be started with small local in-
stallations and can easily be expanded to
cover many miles of highway." He
added:
"Considering that we are now just be-
ginning a vast program of highway con-
struction across the nation, the opportu-
nity exists to do such a job on a large
scale and at minimum cost."
Both Mr. Ress and Dr. Zworykin em-
phasized that the electronic detector units
which form the basis of the system can
be installed in existing highways as well
as in new roads.
"It stands to reason, however," said
Mr. Ress, 'that from the standpoint of
convenience alone, it is better to install
the equipment at the time a road is built,
rather than undertake to do it later when
the traffic has started to flow. Even in
the latter case, however, we have found
that it is unnecessary to tear up the high-
way, since small grooves required by the
wire loops and antennas can be easily
cut into the pavement and filled in as
soon as the wires are laid."
State Engineer Ress pointed out that
while exact estimates of cost cannot yet
be made because of the limited installa-
tion that has been undertaken, "it is
probable that complete installation in new
highways of the future would amount to
only a small fraction of highway cost per
mile."
Rocket Fuel Inspected by X-Ray
A new technique for x-ray inspection
of solid rocket and missile fuel charges,
which surpasses efficiency of existing
methods and which employs a supervolt-
age x-ray generator, has been announced
by High Voltage Engineering Corpora-
tion, makers of Van de Graaff particle
accelerators. One of these supervoltage
x-ray generators is the heart of the sys-
tem developed jointly by High Voltage,
Thiokol Chemical Corporation and Friez
Instrument Division of Bendix Aviation
Corporation.
Thiokol, leading supplier of solid fuel
propellants, sought an improved method
of detecting flaws in propellant castings.
Internal cavities, cracks, fissures or bits
of foreign material can affect perform-
ance of the missile since there is a
critical pre-determined balance ratio be-
tween the missile charge and the center-
line of the missile proper. In actual
operation, as the combustion line advances
along the propellant charge surface, hid-
den pockets or cavities can result in un-
even burning, conceivably affecting the
forward thrust of the missile and altering
its course, or possibly burning a hole
out the side, destroying the missile itself.
Inspection of solid propellants hereto-
fore has been a costly, cumbersome
process. Radiographic film is wrapped
around the outer surface of the missile,
or arranged in a flat lane. X-rays are
passed diametrically through the fuel,
with resultant exposure of film. Limita-
tions of this technique are due to the
high loss of intensity incurred by the
x-rays as they pass through the entire
thickness of the missile before exposing
the film. Thokol engineers concluded
that if a small enough, powerful radio-
graphic generating unit could be devel-
oped, it might be lowered into the hol-
low core of the fuel, cutting penetration
requirements by 50 per cent.
Thiokol contacted High Voltage on de-
sign of a special Van de Graaff x-ray
generator for this particular application.
High Voltage engineers devised a special
10-foot electron tube extension for one
of their standard supervoltage machines,
which would slip down into the propel-
lant core. High energy x-rays are gen-
erated from the tip of the tube so as
to concentrate x-ray intensity in one
direction of relatively acute angle.
Following this success, Thiokol moved
forward on development of a handling
system. This system consists of a rotating
base or platform where the fuel charge
is placed on end. This platform has a
vertical range of movement equal to half
the length of the longest fuel castings.
A Lumicon viewer, manufactured by the
Friez Instrument Division of Bendix Avi-
ation Corporation, is mounted in a fixed
position to one side, with the 10-foot
extension of the Van de Graaff generator
coming down through the ceiling, also
in a fixed position. The accelerator itself
is mounted in a room above.
Method of operation consists essentially
of rotating and raising the fuel charge,
spiral-fashion, about the x-ray source. The
charge is raised a few inches during each
revolution. Thus the fixed x-ray source,
monitored on the Lumicon receiver out-

Tropospheric Communications
System
A contract to build a 295-mile com-
munications system for the Air Force
Elgin Gulf Test Range has been awarded
to Philco Corporation s Government and
Industrial Division.
Outstanding features of this communi-
cations project are the 115-mile micro-
wave relay system and 180-mile, single
hop, troposcopic scatter system. This
over-the-horizon scatter hop will span
the Gulf of Mexico from Cape San Bias
to Anclote Point, about 25 miles north-
west of Tampa, Florida.
Over-the-horizon scatter hops, such as
this, are accomplished by reflecting radio
signals off the earth's troposphere. The
signal is transmitted at extremely high
power from large parabolic antennas.
Philco will build two 60-foot parabolic
antennas at each end of the 180-mile hop.
The five-hop microwave relay system
wil originate at Elgin Air Foce Base and
connect with the scatter site at Cape San
Bias. This four-frequency microwave
system will carry over 100 voice channels,
but can be expanded to 240 channels.
The entire project will cost two mil-
lion dollars and be completed within
18 months.
The system will be used for the trans-
mission of timing, telemetering, radar
data and voice signal information along
the Elgin Gulf Test Range.
In order to meet the top performance
and unattended reliability requirements
specified, Philco will use its recently de-
veloped frequency diversity wide-band
communications equipment. For complete
flexibility, back-to-back terminals will be
used at every station to provide inde-
pendent circuits in each direction.
Frequency diversity provides continuity
of transmission of microwave signais
since messages are transmitted simulta-
neously over two parallel paths. There-
fore, if there is loss of signal on one
path, due to fading or over-water reflec-
tion ,the messages continue uninterrupted
on the other frequency.
Frequency diversity of the microwave
relay link will operate in the 7,000 mega-
cycle range and the tropospheric scatter
link in the 2,000 megacycle range.
Microwave, which is line of sight
transmission of "beamed" radio signals
from one relay tower to another, has
many advantages over the use of wire
lines.
It is less expensive to install and main-
tain, and it is far more reliable during
severe weather conditions. Use of micro-
wave simplifies right-of-way clearance
for traversing properties and more im-
portant, it lends itself to economical ex-
pansion of its channel carrying capacity.
Then there was the country girl who,
while milking a cow, saw a boy coming
up the road. She called to her father,
"Oh, father, there is a boy coming up
the road.'
Her father promptly replied, "Go into
the house."
She called back, "But father, he is
a college man.'
"Then take the cow with you," he
replied.
The freshman's father paid his son
a visit regarding some of the reports
he had been getting back home. Ar-
riving at 1 a.m., he banged on the
fraternity house door. A voice from
the second floor yelled, "What do you
want?"
The father answered: "Does Joe Jones
live here?"
The voice answered: "Yeah, bring
him in."
"Still engaged to Mooude?"
"No."
"Good."
"What?"
"Good, how'd you get rid of her?"
"What?"
"How'd you drop the old hag?"
"I married her."

Looking back through past issues of
the Michigan Technic, one can find
many articles dealing with constructions
considered great in their day. One of
these articles, written by Frederick C.
Noble in June 1908 issue, deals with the
building of the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel.
Another article, in the December 1932
issue, briefly describes the construction
of a "new" airship hangar.
25 Years Ago
Airship Hangar for the Macon
When the new airship hangar, at Sun-
nyvale, California, is completed more
than seven miles of welding will have
gone into its construction. The dimen-
sions of this giant structure, which will
house the U. S. Navy dirigible "Macon,"
sister ship of the "Akron," will be ap-
proximately 1200 feet in length by 308
feet in width by 225 feet in height. Not
only will this hangar be one of the larg-
est buildings in the world, but it will
be the largest building in the world
without pillars or posts to support it.
The hangar, which will be in the shape
of an enormous elongated archway, will
have the world's largest single unob-
structed floor area, nearly 300,000 square
feet, a space large enough to house
five miles of freight cars. Eighty-five
hundred tons of steel are going into the
frame of the structure.
50 Years Ago
Brooklyn's East River Tunnel
About the year 1890 plans were being
made for the construction of a tunnel
under New York's East River, to con-
nect Brooklyn with the lower part of
Manhattan Island. By 1894 several routes
had been proposed for the tunnel. At
the public hearings in May, which were
largely attended by representatives from
various civic bodies, arguments were ad-
vanced principally in favor of two dif-
ferent routes; one via Joralemon St., Ful-
ton Stt., and Flatbush Ave. to Atlantic
Ave., and the other via Hamilton Ave.
to Bay Bridge. At the hearings it proved
that the former route, which was the one
adopted later on, had the the support of
the largest and most representative of
these organizations.
After lengthy study of the two routes,
and consideration of their comparative
merits and costs, the Board finally
adopted, by resoolution of January 24,
1901, the Joralemon St. route; and au-
thorized its president to apply for the
approval of the municipal authorities.
At the subsequent hearings heard before
the Aldermanic Committee on Streets
and Highways and the Railway Commit-
tee of the Council, considerable opposi-
tion to the proposed plan was developed
by advocates of the Hamilton Ave. route,
and it was not until June 1, 1901, that
the necessary aproval of the Municipal
Assembly and the Mayor were secured.
Preliminary Procedures
The necessary consent of the Secretary
of War has been obtained in June for
the construction check of the under river
portion of the route, and the consent of
the City Departments of Parks and
Docks, which were also required, were
obtained in July and December, 1901,
respectively.
Diamond drill and wash borings were
made on the river bed on the tunnel
line between August, 1901, and January,
1902 . The work was let to two different
contractors; the wash borings to F. W.
Miller, and the diamond drill borings to
the United Engineering &amp; Contracting
Co. The wash borings were made about
every 80 feet across the river, by meim
of an outfit mounted on a small steam-
lighter, which was anchored and located
in position for each boring by the use
of range poles and extant-sights. The
casing-pipe was 2y2" diameter and the
wash pipe On account of the cur-
rent, borings were made as much as
possible during slack water. After the
completion of the wash borings, seven
diamond drill borings were made at vari-
ous points where the evidence of the
wash borings seemed inconclusive. The
diamond drill outfit was mounted in each
case on a staging built on a cluster of
six or seven piles, driven during slack
water, and strongly drawn together at
the top with chains by a steam-winch.
The diameter of the core obtained was
%". The drill rod was working
inside a 4", and for the deeper holes
a 6"' casing pipe.
The borings showed that the tunnel
would pass generally through rock on
the Manhattan side to a point near the
middle of the river, and again through
an up-crop of rock before reaching the
Brooklyn side. They also established the
fact that coarse sand and gravel overlaid
the rock on the Manhattan side, and

industry. Linking the turbine exhaust to the
steam generator, the condenser completes
the steam-water cycle—conserves boiler-feed
water and lowers the turbine exhaust pres-

extended through the tunnel line in the
Brooklyn slip; while for the remaining
distance,—from the Brookolyn side to
the rock between the two rock forma-
tions,—the material to be encountered
consisted of fine sand and clay ordinarily
found in the lower part of the city. Rock
cores and samples of the wash-borings
were taken and preserved.
Three bids for construction and oper-
ation were opened on July 21. One was
from the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Com-
pany, of $7,000,000; and the other two
were from the Rapid Transit Subway
Construction Company, of $2,000,000
and $3,000,000. The contract was
awarded to the Rapid Transit Construc-
tion Co., on the basis of the lower bid,
July 24, 1902; and was executed as
"Contract No. 2," September 11, 1902.
The contract price of $2,000,000 was
estimated to be about one-fifth of the
actual cost of construction.
The tunnel consists of two circular
track tubes of the usual cast iron ring
construction, they are 15'-6" internal
diameter, and run side by side 28 feet
apart on centers, except under Joralemon
Street where this distance is decreased
to 26 feet. The tubes are lined through-
out with concrete, and are grouted ex-
ternally. The grade is 31^« downward
on each side of the river, except for a
short distance near the middle, where a
0.5% grade upward toward Brooklyn was
later introduced. This portion is joined
to the steeper grades on each side by
vertical curves of 10,000 feet radius.
The tunnel is everywhere below water
level, except for about 700 feet at the
east or Brooklyn end. The lowest point
reached by the tunnel is 94 feet below
mean high water.
Construction
Excavation for the Manhattan shaft,
located in the Battery Park enclosure
opposite South Ferry began March 4,
1903. The shaft measured 14 feet by
52 feet in plan, taking in the headings
of both tubes, and extended to the tun-
nel subgrade, about 45 feet below the
surface. It was sheeted on all sides with
5" tongued and grooved sheeting driven
to the rock line, which was reached ap-
proximately half way down.
The headings for the north and south
tubes were started west from the Man-
hattan shaft on April 9 and April 16,
1903, respectively. By the end of May,
1906, the headings reached a point near
the end of the rock formation, where-
further progress was stopped temporarily
to install shields . In September the ad-
vance was resumed with the new shields.
The first Brooklyn shafts, one for each
tube, were located in Joralemon St. about
1,300 feet inland from the river, just
west of Henry St., and about 700 feet
from the end of the tunnel section.
Excavation of the south shaft began April
16, 1903, and for the north shaft June
10, 1903. They were each 20 feet by
24 feet in plan, sheeted with 4" tongued
and grooved sheeting, and extended 65
feet below the surface to the bottom of
the tunnel.
The first portion of the tunnel to be
built in Brooklyn was the length of about
700 feet in each tube east from the shaft&gt;
to the end of the section. The shield
for the south tube was started east July
10, 1903, and reached the end of the
section January 11, 1904. The shield
for the north tube was started east
September 15, 1903, and reached the
end of the section January 16, 1904.
The final meeting between the head-
ings took place between the two rock
formations under the river. The north
shields met December 14, 1906, and
the south shields met March 1, 1907.
They were then dismantled, leaving the
outer shells in place, after which the
cast iron lining was completed.
All tunneling operatitons were carried
on in compressed air, except in the
Brooklyn headings east of the Henry St.
shafts, where the tubes are above water
level, and inside the bulkhead line it
South Ferry, where the leakage could be
easily controlled by pumping. The work-
ing pressure varied from a few pounds
to a maximum of 42 pounds per square
inch above atmospheric pressure at the
deepest section under the middle of the
river. The tubes were divided into work-
ing chambers by brick or concrete bulk-
heads at intervals, into each of which
were built two locks for passage of
workmen and materials.
The tunnel shell was built up of
flanged cast iron plates, bolted together
by their flanges to form rings, each com-
posed of 8 segments and a key. The

Why Vought Projects
Bring Out The Best
In An Engineer
At Vought, the engineer doesn't often
forget past assignments. Like all big
events, they leave vivid memories.
And it's no wonder.
For here the engineer contributes to
history-making projects — among
them the record-breaking Crusader
fighter; the Regulus II missile, chosen
to arm our newest nuclear subs; and
the new fast-developing 1,500-plus-
mph fighter, details of which are still
classified.
The Vought engineer watches such
weapons take shape. He supervises
critical tests, and he introduces the
weapons to the men with whom they
will serve.
Engineers with many specialties share
these experiences. Today, for exam-
ple, Vought is at work on important
projects involving:
electronics design and manufacture
inertial navigation
investigation of advanced propulsion
methods
Mach 5 configurations
Vought's excellent R&amp;D facilities
help the engineer through unexplored
areas. And by teaming up with other
specialists against mutual challenges,
the Vought engineer learns new fields
while advancing in his own.

The Missile Engineer with undersea legs
Jack Welch felt honored when he was tossed, fully
clothed, into the Navy's sub harbor at Port Hueneme,
California. In their own rugged way, submariners were
extending him their thanks. He'd been a big help in
the introduction of Chance Vought's Regulus 1 missile
to the Navy's Undersea Fleet.
Months before his ceremonial splash. Jack had accom-
panied the Regulus aboard the submarines Tunny and
Barbero as a representative of Vought's Missile Oper-
ations Engineering Group. A veteran of the Regulus
flight test program and a collaborator on the con-
version of the subs to missile carriers, Jack brought
knowledge the Navy welcomed. Likewise, the Navy
crews were to share with Jack some equally valuable
experience.
Jack, with the submarines Tunny and Barbero, cruised
the East and West Coasts, performed over 200 dives,
and once prowled far west of Hawaii. The missile man
helped the undersea crews complete initial checkouts
of Regulus support equipment — culminating in the
first missile launch ever made from a submarine. Then
they went about solving environmental and supply
problems that arose during tests. Jack added to his
mechanical engineering experience a valuable store of
electrical, weapon systems and Navy knowledge.
Back in home port, on the Tunny's quarter-deck, with
a full crew assembled, submarine officers reviewed
Jack's contributions. He'd gone beyond his duty as a
technical advisor, they concluded. He'd become an
expert submariner as well. In fact, he'd qualified for
the Silent Service's Gold Dolphin insignia . . . and all
hands would proceed at once with the traditional
initiation. That's when Jack took his plunge.
Today, Jack divides his time between Chance Vought
and a half-dozen Navy shipyards. His job is to see
that current missile and ship design is meeting the
missile needs of the Fleet. Problems are many, but
Jack maintains there's a solution for each. "That's a
lesson I learned from the submarine forces," he said.
"They gave me a real indoctrination in a can-do atti-
tude under actual operating conditions."
At Chance Vought the missile engineer belongs to a
team that already has experienced every conceivable
missile problem, from development to operational
readiness. Here, current assignments range from the-
oretical work to the introduction of complete missile
systems to the Fleet.

AN ENGINEERING TOOL
by RICHARD CUMMING, '60E
In all branches of engi-
neering the planimeter
finds uses as a time saver
and a labor saver.
The Planimeter and Its Uses
t t is the engineer's lot to be beset by
_|_ problems (not that no one else is).
Every day he struggles with problems.
For example, when a highway is construc-
ted some unfortunate civil engineer is
told to calculate the volume of earth to
be moved. If he plots a cross sectional
curve of cut and fill at regular intervals
along the highway, the volume to be
moved will be, with any luck, the area
under this curve. It is conceivable that
someone might want to know the devel-
oped horsepower of a steam engine at
Detaching ourselves from these strug-
gling engineers we see that such typical
engineering problems have one common
property. They all require that we know
the area under a curve in order to get
a solution to the problem. Undoubtedlv
the quickest and easiest way to obtain
the area under any curve is by the use
of a planimeter, unless the curve takes
a very simple form, which is about as
likely as getting an "A" in EE 5.
The planimeter is the simplest form
of mechanical integrator. More exactly it
is an instrument for measuring the area
Richard H. Cummings, a Technic
guest writer, is a sophomore in
Naval Architecture. A graduate of
Fordson High School, Dearborn,
Dick lists as his interests ships,
skiing, math and girls (but not
necessarily in that order he adds).
Dick, a transfer student from
Michigan Tech, has worked on ore
cariers on the great lakes during
the summer months.
a certain RPM. Learning about the en-
gine, the engineer looks at the indicator
card which is a plot of pressure versus
volume in the cylinder. It is a closed
curve and the area inside the curve is
the work done per cycle, from which the
engineer can get the horsepower. The
naval architect must find the areas of
hundreds of figures in order to develop
a ship's curves of form.
of any plane figure. The type which is
most commonly used is the polar plani-
meter, which consists of essentially fi\t
parts: the pole arm, one end of which
is fixed; the tracing arm; the tracinc
point; and two measuring wheels. One
wheel rolls on the paper and its cir-
cumference is divided in a manner that
will allow us to read it to the thon-
soondth part of one revolution. The

of merely counting the revolutions of the
first. In order to determine the area of
a figure we simply set the pole at a con-
venient point outside the figure and
note the reading of the wheels. The trac-
ing point is then run once around the
figure and the readings again noted. The
difference in the readings multiplied by
the proper scale factor will be the area
of the figure. How easy can anything be?
Of course we don't want to let our
enthusiasm get the best of us. The plani-
meter is not the best choice in all cases
—only in about ninety-nine percent of
the cases is it the best choice. Let's con-
sider two curves. One is a simple, mathe-
matically expressible curve and the other
is any sort of monstrosity that we might
dream up (which is what we usually wind
up with anyway).
The first curve will be a parabola
whose equation is:
y = x2
If we want the area under this curve
from x = 0 to x = 1.0 we know from
the calculus that the desired area is given
by the expression:
o o w
SQ. UNITS
This procedure takes about one minute.
Assuming that we have the plot of the
curve as well as its equation, we could
divide the abscissa into an appropriate
number of units and integrate between
the desired limits of 2ero and one by
means of one of the several arithmetical
rules of integration. This consists of
merely scaling off the value of the ordin-
ates at each unit along the curve and
multiplying these values by the proper
factor. This procedure would take about
twenty minutes for a curve such as the
one we are discussing. If neither of these
methods satisfies us we can run the plani-
meter around the curve to get the area.
This would take about five or six minutes,
including time required to determine the
proper scale factor.
Now let's investigate our "monstros-
ity." It's pretty apparent upon first glance
that we might have a hard time finding
the equation of this curve, and if we
did find it it's still ten-to-one that we
couldn't integrate it. If we try to use the
arithmetical rules of integration we run
into trouble again. It would probably
take about an hour or more to get the
area with one of the rules. What course
is left to us? That's right, the good old
planimeter will do the job, and do it
almost as quickly as it did the job on our
first curve. Thus we see that unless the
curve in question has a readily integrable
equation, the planimeter will give us the
quickest, most painless results.
So far the picture looks pretty bright.
Nevertheless, the planimeter is, as you
may have already suspected, not com-
pletely accurate in the results it gives.
Some of the errors arise from mechanical
faults and the rest are attributable to
errors on the part of the operator.
The operator is bound to make a few
small deviations from the true perimeter
of the figure in the process of taking the
readings. This type of error can be best
compensated for by taking a series of
readings. If the readings are fairly well
in agreement (three or four percent
deviation) we can use the mean value
of the series.
Mechanical errors can crop up from
a number of sources. If the measuring
wheel diameter is not accurate errors will
result. Misalignment of the measuring
wheel axis will also cause errors.
A somewhat different source of error
comes from the action of the measuring
wheel itself. The majority of the move-
ment of the measuring wheel will be in
directions neither parallel nor perpen-
dicular to the axis of the wheel. Let us
assume the wheel is moving as indicated.
Since the reading of the wheel is com-
pletely dependent on the rotary motion
of the wheel, the accuracy of the read-
ing is dependent upon the effect the
sliding component of motion has on the
rotary component. The size of this effect
will vary with the surface over which
the wheel is being run. If the tracing
point is not run around an area of known
size as a check each time a different
type of surface is used, errors of this
type are bound to occur.
If we check the planimeter constant
periodically by running over a test area
and are careful while tracing around a
figure, most commercial planimeters will
be accurate to within one percent.

rings were 15'-6" internal diameter, 22"
in length, ll/g" depth over flanges. All
abutting surfaces were planed, the seg-
ments were bolted to the adjoining ones
in the same ring with three 1" bolts, and
the rings were bolted to each other with
49 1" bolts in the circumferential
flanges. The weight of the ring varied
according to location; the lighter ones,
weighing 7,319 pounds each, being used
in rock and above water level in Brook-
lyn and the heavier ones, weighing 8,332
poounds and 9,410 pounds each, being
used under the river and for the rest of
the work. Many of the segments, both
of the light and heavy sections, cracked
under the strains they were subjected to
during construction ,and these were re-
moved if practicable, or if not, they were
reinforced later with steel rods embedded
in concrete.
The lining was made watertight by
caulking with metallic lead in the re-
cesses at the inner edges of the joints
and grommeting the bolts under the
heads and nuts with a ring of hemp and
red lead under a plate washer.
The matter of the stability of the fine
sand each side of the Brooklyn reef
under the loads of moving trains having
been questioned by officials of the Inter-
borough Company it was considered ad-
visable by them to provide some auxiliary
means of support, such as piles reaching
to rock at intervals under the tubes where
they passed through the material in ques-
tion. This view was not concurred in
by the City engineers, but as experiments
showed that the piles might be driven
rapidly without materially delaying com-
pletion, the work was allowed to proceed.
Workers take a break in the construc-
tion of the underwater portion of the
South Tube. A close look will reveal that
they have reached the stage of lining
the tube with reinforced concrete.
In the midriver section, between the
Brooklyn reef and the Manhattan rock
formation, 17 concrete pile bents were
sunk under the north tube and 1 5 under
the south. Each bent consists of 2 piles,
about 20" in diameter, spaced 7 ft. apart
transversely and about 30 ft. apart longi-
tudinally of the tunnel. The piles were
driven to depths ranging from 5 to 40
ft. In the fine sand formation east of
the Brooklyn reef, 15 similar pile bents
were sunk in each of the tubes. The
pile bents in this section were spaced
about 50 ft. apart longitudinally, and
extended to depths ranging from a few
feet to 75 ft. In every case the piles
were driven to hard material.
After making the cast iron lining
watertight the air pressure was removed,
and the interior of the shell lined with
small stone concrete.
At the bottom under the track the con-
crete was brought 8" inside the flanges
and levelled at the ends of the ties to
afford them a solid bearing.
The concrete lining of the roof wi&gt;
brought flush with the inside of the
flanges of the cast iron lining wherever
the tunnel is in rock, or under the land
east of the bulkhead line in Brooklyn.
After the concrete lining was placed
it was given a wash of cement grout
as a finish to the surface.
There are two permanent shafts, one
at South Ferry and one at Willow Place.
Brooklyn, which will serve as ventilating
openings as well as connections for the
drainage system and power cables. The
working shaft at South Ferry was en-
larged for this purpose, but the Willow
Place shaft was a new one, excavated
under air pressure and sealed to the out-
side of the tunnel shell. The shafts are
lined with reinforced concrete, include
both tubes of the tunnel, and measure
about 14 ft. by 45 ft. inside in plan
The shafts were equipped with electric
fans so arranged that the air may be
moved in or out for either of the tubes.
Under ordinary conditions it is expected
that adequate ventilation w^ill be ob-
tained by the movement of air from the
passage of trains through the tubes.
"You have been charged with fight-
ing," said the judge. "Have you any
explanation?"
"Well, your honor," said the de-
fendant, "it was like this. I was in a
phone booth talking to my girl when
this guy comes up and wants to use
the phone. He opens the door, grabs
me by the neck and tosses me out on
my ear."
"Then you got angry?" asked the
judge.
"Yes, a little," answered the man.
"But I didn't get real mad until he
grabbed my girl and threw her our, too."
A college professor bought a parrot
from the pet store only to learn that
it cursed every time it said anything.
He put up with it as long as he could
but finaly one day he lost his patience.
"If I ever hear you swear again, I'll
wring your neck."
A few minutes later he remarked cas-
ually that it was a fine day. Whereupon
the parrot said, "It's a hell of a fine

Soon after Spring vacation, there will be a tung-of-Hvar between the fresh-
man and sophomore engineering classes. This annual rivalry dates back nearly
to the beginning of the Engineering College. Until recently it was called the
Spring Rush and was quite different from this year's affair. The Spring Rush
was not much more than a wild melee where the two classes lined up opposite
each other and on a given signal rushed forward. Everything short of murder
was legal.
Due to a shortage of bed space in University Hospital, this "sport" had
to be abandoned and was replaced by the present tug-of-war. The traditional
site for this event is the Huron River, so the loser receives not only a moral
defeat, but a good soaking as well. The exact sit and time have not been
decided, but both will be published in the Michigan Daily and the Arch.

NEW CHICAGO SUN-TIMES BUILDING
equipped with long-lasting,
dependable JENKINS VALVES
In advanced planning, as in location and design, the new
Sun-Times Building is front-page news. For this is the first
project to be completed in a development which will trans-
form the area north of Chicago's Loop into a city of the future.
There can be only one basis for selecting physical equip-
ment for such a plant: the ability to perform efficiently and
economically for years. This is why Jenkins Valves are
standard on all plumbing, heating and air conditioning lines
in the block-long structure.
The extra measure of performance and reliability built
into Jenkins Valves has for generations assured long oper-
ating life and low maintenance cost. That's well to remember
when you specify valves . . . especially since the valves that
bear the famous Jenkins Diamond mark cost no more.

GALILEO
(Continued from page 40)
In June, 1609, Galileo heard word of
the telescope being invented in Holland,
which immediately set him to thinking.
Already experienced in optics, he was
able to quickly design and build a tele-
scope for himself. The great value of
such an instrument became apparent to
many noblemen and senators of the Vene-
tian Republic, who flocked to him for
to look through his telescope. One of
the more influential persons of this group
saw the naval and military value of the
telescope and desired to own the instru-
ment. Galileo presented it to him and
in return, his professorship was confirmed
for life, at one thousand florins a year.
By January, of 1610, Galileo had been
able to construct a telescope that would
magnify thirty times. With this, he be-
came first to observe the mountains on
the moon, juding their height to be four
or five miles by observing the length of
their shadows. He also noted that the
Milky Way consisted of stars and was
not merely a scarf of nebulous gas. To
these observations, he added the dis-
covery of four unsuspected moons of the
planet Jupiter.
Limited Academic Freedom,
Limits Productivity
Though Galileo was now famous and
highly paid, he longed to live once more
with his family in Florence. He desired
this so much, that in May of 1610, he
wrote a letter to the Tuscan Secretary
of State, asking if he might have his
chair at Pisa reinstated, without having
teaching responsibilities, as he wished to
devote his time to his research, writing
books of the discoveries he had made.
In reply to his letter, the Grand Duke
of Tuscany offered him one thousand
scudi a year to become First Mathema-
tician of the University of Pisa. This
pleased Galileo, and he prepared to leave.
Galileo was forty-six when he left Padua
and in the prime of life. His friends
and even himself had some misgivings
about his giving up his good and secure
life in Padua to be nearer his family
but he decided moving to Florence was
what he wanted to do. One aspect which
troubled his friends was the fact that in
Padua, in the Venetian Republic, he was
free to say what he wished about what-
ever and whomever he wished. In Flor-
ence, there would be no such intellectual
freedom.
Indeed, almost as soon as Galileo ar-
rived in Florence, he became involved
in a controversy which soon led to a re-
striction of what he could say and do.
Galileo's difficulties began when he no-
ticed spots on the sun which led him to
believe the sun was rotating. However,
a Jesuit monk also claimed to have made
the same discovery and the ensuing con-
troversy united all the Jesuit Order
against him. The Jesuits stirired up
much sentiment against Galileo and led
some to doubt that his research agreed
with the Scriptures. Eventually, Galileo
was called to Rome to explain his be-
liefs. He was not able to do so satis-
factorily and hence, was warned not to
hold, defend ,or teach the belief that the
sun rotated. Nor was he to teach that
the earth revolved about the sun.
Galileo returned home a frustrated in-
dividual. After a time, he developed a
very extensive correspondence with the
philosophers of Europe, to whom, he ex-
pressed his new theories as "dreams, or
fancies."
In 1623, one of Galileo's friends be-
came Pope and this induced him to again
try to get his beliefs about the solar
system accepted. However, the new Pope
wasn't sure Galileo was correct, either,
and so the interdiction was not lifted.
This time, though, Galileo went ahead
and wrote a book, "Dialogues Concern-
ing the Two Principal Systems of the
World," which was based on the theory
he was forbidden to teach. The Holy
Office forbade sale of the book, almost
immediately after it was printed, and
again caled Galileo to Rome. This time,
he was examined by the Inquisition, and
found "vehemently suspected of heresy."
He eventually was senteced to spend the
rest of his life under house arrest, at
his villa, receiving no visitors. The house
arrest restriction and the barring of visi-
tors was lifted when he became blind in
1638. His creative mind functioned to
the last and just before he died, he had
his son draw up plans for a pendulum
clock he described. After a period of
ill health, Galileo Galilei passed away on
January 8, 1642.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


The activities of the mechanical engineer cover the generation and use of heat and power, and
the design, production, and application of a wide variety of machinery and equipment. The mech-
anical engineer is concerned with the design and manufacture of automobiles and other transpor-
tation media; internal combustion engines; gas and steam turbines; hydraulic machinery; manufac-
turing and materials handling machinery and equipment; heating, ventilating, air-conditioning and
refrigeration equipment; consumer goods such as home appliances; and many more items. He is
responsible for significant phases of nuclear power development, and for certain phases of the oper-
aation of public utility power plants. He engages in research in thermodynamics, heat transfer,
fluid mechanics, design and manufacturing processes. Indeed, it is difficult to name a product of the
nation's industries that does not reflect work of the mechanical engineer.
The varied and demanding nature of the work performed by the mechanical engineer requires
a curriculum with a strong foundation in the basic sciences of physics, mathematics, and chemistry.
To these are added studies in the engineering sciences: solid and fluid mechancis, thermodynamics
and heat transfer, electricity and electronics, and materials. All of these fundamentals then are
applied—through lecture, laboratory and design courses—to machine design, production processes
and methods, and to heat and power machinery. Appropriate attention is given to study in the areas
of composition, speech and economics, and to the humanities and social sciences. While specializa-
tion is not desirable at the undergraduate level, th student has available a certain number of electives
which he may direct at areas of special interest to him. These include air conditioning and referger-
ation, automotive, fluids engineering, heat-power engineering, machine design and manufacturing.
University of Michigan laboratories for mechanical engineering include such items of equipment
as gas and steam turbines, diesel power plants, air-conditioning and ventilating equipment, hydraulic
machinery, manufacturing and inspection equipment of modern instrumentation. A new and com-
pletely-equipped Automotive Laboratory has been completed on the North Campus, and a new Fluids
Laboratory is under construction. In addition to these facilities, the student also uses the laboratories
of the departments of Engineering Mechanics, Electrial Engineering, and Chemical and Metallurg-
ical Engineering.

(Continued from page 23)
B + H -» Zip Fuel
In 1952 the Air Force gave the assign-
ment of finding a perfect fuel to Olin-
Mathieson Chemical Corp. and Gallery
Chemical Company. On the basis of the
facts that hydrogen is the perfect fuel
and that an exhaust of light molecular
weight is more powerful than one of
heavy molecular weight, these two com-
panies naturally began their search at the
top of the periodic table of elements.
They found that beryllium combines well
with hydrogen and packed tremendous
heat, but it is scarce and the exhaust
fumes are toxic. Boron, the fifth clement,
appeared to be the best prospect, since
it was plentiful, inexpensive, combined
well with hydrogen, and yielded 25,000
BTU per pound when burned in a pure
state.
Boron is found in nature as a borate
or a boric acid. It forms several oxides,
acids, and borides with metals, boron
carbide, boron halides, boron hydrides,
and numerous organic compounds. Sev-
eral of these compounds have been found
to contain more heat energy than pure
boron, which has intensified the search
for a better compound. Diborane
(B..H,), for example, yields 31,500
BTU/lb., pentaborane (B,H,,) yields 2,-
000 BTU/lb., and decarborane (B1(,H14)
yields 28,000 BTU/lb. Olin Mathieson
now has a pilot plant at Niagara Falls,
New York, and Gallery has pilot plants
at Lawrence, Kansas and Muskogee,
Oklahoma to produce these boron fuels.
A boron-hydrogen fuel would have cost
$5,000 per pound a few years ago, but
it is now growing as an industry at a
rate which should bring the cost down
to $5.00 per pound by 1959. This high-
energy property of boron is currently
being capitalized on by several of our
leading petroleum companies who adver-
tize it as an important fuel additive.
Non-Chemical Fuel Systems
The ionic rocket seems assured of a
position in the future. The ion rocket
carries a fuel and means to convert it
into positive and negatitve ions with nu-
clear or electromagnetic energy. The ions
could be expelled at 450,000 mph with
a specific impulse of 20,000, but with x
very weak thrust, which makes it im-
practical for anything other than inter-
planetary flight, in which case it would
have to be pushed beyond the earth s
gravitational field by some auxiliary
means. The most probable fuel would
be the metal cesium, which has a melt-
ing point of 830°F.
The ram-jet type of ion rocket would
carry a catalyst and rely on the catalytic
reformation of ions in the upper at-
mosphere, such as atomic oxygen. This
is of course limited to areas where fret-
ions are available, which suggests uses in
satellites with non-ballistic or controllable-
trajectories, space stations, or manned rc-
search-weather-TV platforms.
Rockets powered by solar heat are
under serious consideration by some scien-
tists who say that a rocket could be made
which would substitute 1,000 pounds of
mirrors for 45-50,000 pounds of fuel.
This rocket would have a thrust of 160.
and, if it could be pushed through the
earth's atmosphere, could get to Mars
or Venus with luck.
Free radicals are the most promising
rocket propellant of the futture, although
scientists warn that they could cause can-
cer. Free radicals are uncharged atoms
or pieces of molecules that are more
stable when combined with other radi-
cals. Highly energetic, having a lifetime
of only a few thousandths of a second,
they release energy in the form of light
and heat when they return to stable con-
figurations. Free radicals are generated
by high energy sources, such as an elec-
trical discharge, ultra-violet light, or
gamma radiation.
Few free radicals are known today
which are any better than chemical pro-
pellants. Only those of light atomic
weight, such as hydrogen, are capable of
supplying important amounts of energy:
75% free hydrogen radicals in a working
fluid of molecular hydrogen yields 50
Kcal per gram, whereas molecular hydro-
gen alone yields 3 Kcal per gram.

Electric and Atomic Clocks
With the discovery of the electric mo-
tor and its subsequent reduction in size,
a new, cheap, accurate, and compact
power source for clocks was realized. The
use of an electric motor to power a clock
has resulted in much simplification of
clock mechanisms. The only essential
group of parts is the going gear train,
which rotates the hands at the correct
rate. The only drawback to a good elec-
tric clock is that it will stop running
when the source of electricity is cut off.
This, however, is a minor flaw, due to
its infrequency.
In the past few years even wrist
watches have been fitted to electric mo-
tors, which are powered by miniature
mercury batteries. The batteries need re-
placing less than once a year, and the
new watches are expected to keep better
time than the average spring-driven
watch.
There is an old legend that the life
span of the earth will be measured by
a mountain and a small bird. The legend
says that every thousand years a small
bird will fly to this mountaian (which
is 100 miles high, 100 miles long, and
100 miles wide), for the sole purpose of
sharpening its beak. When the moun-
tain has been completely worn down, so
the legend goes, the earth's "time will be
up." While such a tale is quite amusing.
the fact remains that until the final day
of civilization people will be ever en-
grossed in the great game telling time
whether it be my the old standbys of
clocks and sundials, instruments yet to
be developed, or mountains and birds.

KEY TO OUTER SPACE
(Continued from page 64)
There are, of course, obstacles in this path as well as the
others. The high temperatures formed in a free radical rocket
would evaporate the combustion chamber in seconds. Th..
molecular hydrogen in the exhaust would be broken apan
into free radicals with important losses of energy—at 2,}00°C
significant redissociation would occur, and at 5,000c there
would exist an equilibrium conditon with 45% of free radi-
cals. A 10% concentration of atomic hydrogen is neicssar.
to provide any important increase in thrust; to date we hau
attained in the lab only 1% concentration, which degrade
very rapidly even though frozen at liquid helium tempera-
ture of 4°K. Other radicals being investigated are NH. CH.
and Nitrogen.
The potential of free radicals lies in the upper atmosphere,
which is rich in free radicals. A ram-jet could fly 100 mil&lt;&gt;
above the surface of the earth without fuel, or a scoop J"
feet in diameter could scoop up enough free radicals to pro-
duce one watt of energy, enough to offset the drag of '■
satellite. Most scientists agree that a major break through b
needed before free radical power can be realized.
While all of these methods of rocket propulsion have a
definite future, the near future will probably see liquid futU
continuing to be the workhorse propelant, unless the Navy
opens the door to solid fuel propulsion by launching :'■&gt;
"Polaris," which is destined to be our first solid fuel iocte
But the rocket age is here to stay, and when more progfp-
is made, we can be sure it will be made through one or more
of these fuels.

Professor Gordon G. Van Wylen
When one thinks of the chairman of
an academic department of a great Uni-
versity, the vision of an elderly man
with clear and emotionless eyes, and a
precise and staid countenance comes to
mind. It is with somewhat of a sur-
prise, then, to enter the office of the
new chairman of the Mechanical Engi-
neering department and find yourself
looking up into the smiling face of a
tall, pleasantly rugged looking individual.
Gordon John Van Wylen, professor of
Mechanical Engineering and chairman of
the department, was born in Grant,
Michigan in 1920, and grew up in
Grand Rapids. He graduated from three
institutions: Calvin College, the Univer-
sity of Michigan, and Massachusetts In-
stitute of Technology, holding A.B., B.S.,
M.S., and Sc.D. degrees.
Faced with the question of whether
he always intended to become a teacher,
Professor Van Wylen broke into a wide
grin, folded his hands casually behind
his head, and leaned far back in his
swivel chair.
"To tell the truth," he answered laugh-
ingly, "when I graduated in 1942 my
first reaction was: 'Boy, I'm finally
done with college.'" Rather ironically,
he added, his first inclination to enter
the teaching profession occurred a few
years later, many fathoms under the
Pacific Ocean.
After his graduation in 1942, Pro-
fessor Van Wylen went to work for Du-
Pont. Shortly after that he went into
the Navy and eventually finished Mid-
shipman's school. There were two alter-
natives open to graduates of this school:
go where the Navy sent you, or volun-
teer for submarine duty. Exercising his
one chance for freedom of choice, he
became a submarine officer, and claimed
the distinction of six successful war pa-
trols in six attempts: an enemy victim
on every patrol.
"We did have our embarrassing mo-
ments," Profesor Van Wylen recalled.
"On our first patrol we sighted and sank
an enormous ship and claimed that we
had destroyed a battleship. However,
after all the intelligence reports were
later evaluated we found we had only
sunk a light cruiser."
It was during this undersea period
that he thought he would like to enter
the teaching profession: after service, be
decided, he would try his hand at it.
In the Spring of 1946 he became i
teaching fellow at the University of
Michigan. While in the middle of his
degree requirements he was shanghaied
by Penn State and taught there for two
years, after which period he completed
his Master's degree.
At present Professor Van Wylen, along
with his department commitments, is
working on a Redstone Arsenal projea
for the development of new techniques
for emptying liquid oxygen tanks. His
text book on thermodynamics is cur-
rently being used in ME 105 and 106.
He is on the board of directors of the
Intervarsity Christian Fellowship, taking

The head of a pin would appear about 47 feet wide if ex-

microanalyzer—the first to be used industrially in this
country. U. S. Steel research teams use it to get a better
look at the microstructure of new types of steel. In this
way, they gather more information about the factors affect-
ing steel quality and performance.
Research like this is only the start of the big job at U. S.
Steel. We have to find more ore, mine it, ship it, make it
into steel, market it (and market many by-products, too)
and deliver it to our customers. The job calls for a lot of

Because engineering is a profession at GM-
your talents can take you to the top
Commencement literally means a beginning—although
it marks the end of your undergraduate days.
Perhaps one of your classmates — or you, yourself —
has decided to start a career with General Motors.
It's a wise choice for many reasons but particularly
for this one:
Engineering is a profession at GM. And the engineers
who work on our hundreds of products are respected
as professional men.
To a young engineer that fact is a key consideration.
For professional recognition carries with it many bene-
fits. The freedom to give your imagination free rein.
The opportunity to pioneer significant developments
in the engineering art. The chance to become a key
executive in a great corporation.
The fact that more than 179 of our engineers and
scientists received more than 164 patents in a recent
four-month period is one measure of the intellectual
freedom engineers have at GM.
And the fact that 14 of our 33 Vice-Presidents—23 of
our 42 Division General Managers—are engineers is an
indication of the advancement opportunities for engi-
neering graduates at GM.
General Motors is made up of 35 Divisions with 126
plants in 71 cities and 19 states. Many of the young
men who join us today will hold top positions with those
Divisions and plants 10 to 15 years from now. One of
those men could well be your classmate—or you.

1958 has passed the same unique problem to nearly everyone of us; the
U. S. economical recession has forced industry to cut its programs of summer
employment (and often permanent employment), with the result that jobs
have been few and far between for this summer. Also a noticeable decrease
in permanent career opportunities has been felt. Salaries have risen, but not
as much as in each of the past several years. But, it is unnecessary and repeti-
tious to complain about the situation or to explain it—the reader will find
the rest of this issue discusses several "angles" to economy and what it means
to engineers.
An important point to be made, of which most of you are probably well
aware, is that engineers are still in demand, and very much so. Last October,
when Sputnik I was launched, and during the past several years, leaders of
American industry and education have moaned about our lack of engineers,
and worse, the low rate at which engineers were being graduated by U. S.
colleges and universities compared with Russia. A situation as dire as this
was supposed to be a year ago couldn't have reversed itself this soon—it has
merely been "re-evaluated," but any current literature on engineering demand
would point this out.
The primary idea to gain from our experiences with job-hunting this
year should be that, although a definitely strong demand for engineers exists,
it is now a demand for capable engineers. "Sure, we want engineers," says
industry, "but now we want the best to be found if possible." Companies are
being considered more selective in choosing new employees. Naturally it is
in a time like this that we as students must put out that "little extra" to prove
ourselves for the times when life gets even tougher. The rest of our lives
will be no bed of roses, and perhaps we've gotten a little soft and over-accus-
tomed to the mad scramble for engineers that industry has been going through
for the past decade. We can look upon the present situation as an 'adjustment'
of the entire situation, and we should observe it carefully since it holds the
key to the future. And—we can learn a valuable lesson about the industry in
which we plan our career by observing the marked ups-and-downs of the
present situation. Above all, we should work harder in order to prove our-
selves to prospective employers.

CREATIVITY
and PRODUCIBILITY
Basic research has been described as "a search for knowl-
edge, unfettered by production demands." At Avco, we
realize that fundamental new ideas cannot be programmed
in advance to fit the needs of even the highest priority
schedule. There will always be room here for this kind of
basic creative work.
Yet, as an industrial research operation, we want to
realize the material benefits that have historically resulted
from scientific breakthroughs. Economic common sense
and national security require an industrial research struc-
ture that can transform the idea in a scientist's brain into
workable, useful hardware.
We see nothing inconsistent in the pursuit of new products
simultaneously with the pursuit of new ideas—and doing
both under the same roof. Rather, we feel that the con-
tinuous feedback resulting from close association of basic
research people, applied scientists and engineers, test
engineers and product engineers does as much for creativ-
ity as for producibility. And America's future depends
upon a good supply of both.

Chemistry stands
at the threshold of
a new age of discovery
It has been said that more significant scientific advances
have taken place in the last fifty years than in all the
centuries that have gone before. One fact is indisputably
clear. The use of applied science in American industry
today is progressing at a rate so fantastic it staggers
the imagination of the boldest visionary!
This is particularly evident in the vast, highly diversi-
fied field of industrial chemistry. Here, products, ma-
terials and processes that were unknown a few years
ago are in wholesale use today. The accomplishments
of chemical research are being felt in every area of
human endeavor. The prospect of further advancement
in the immediate future appears limited only by man's
imagination and his desire for improvement.
Our society stands at the threshold of a new age of
discovery that offers an infinitely better way of life as
its reward. A host of courageous, creative industrial
chemists will help lead the way.

INDUSTRIAL
PROBLEMS
by BARRY PEEBLES, '60 E
Many Michigan industries,
plagued by high taxes and oth-
er problems, are doing more
expanding in other states.
Shown at the left is an aerial view
of the Ford Motor Company's
River Rouge plant. Ford is just
one of the large Michigan indus-
tries that is meeting its industrial
problems by expanding outside
Michigan's State Line.
Unless drastic action, including the
revamping of Michigan's tax struc-
ture and the modifying of its attitude
toward business and industry, is taken
quickly, Michigan will soon find itself
on the downward trail that eventually
leads to an industrial ghost state.
A shocking statement, but an accurate
one; according to the nation's financial
and business experts, according to the
examples of other states, and most of all,
according to the facts.
Still you may question the accuracy of
such a statement and ask, "Is it leally
true? Is industry actually leaving the state
or being deterred from coming here be-
cause of high industrial taxes? If this
is true, why? What are causes behind
this situation? But most important, if
this trend does exist what can be done
to stop and then reverse it?"
These are just a few of the many
questions that could be asked but they
are the important ones. Still they barely
open the door on a subject that is tak-
ing one of the nation's leading tax men
over a year to fully study. However,
it is still possible, even in the short
space we have, to briefly study this situ-
ation, to examine the facts, to consider
the opinions of experts on both sides,
and finally to draw some conclusions.
These will be our goals in the following
analysis.
Issues Take Shape
Before beginning our study let us
briefly review the circumstances that have
thrust this problem so forcibly into the
limelight during the past months. As
you may recall, a little more than a year
ago Michigan's tax policies and their
effect on industry were the cause of a
violent controversy that lasted from early
April until well into the summer months.
The spark that set off this public con-
troversy came on April 4, 1957 when
six Democratic legislators introduced a
bill in the state House of Representa-
tives calling for a 6% corporation profits
tax that would bring an extra 76 million
dollars into the state coffers.
As time drew closer to the day that
the bill would actually come before the
House both sides began to "jockey for
position." On April 12 Gov. G. Men-
nen Williams obtained a copy of a pre-
liminary report prepared by a group that
was studying the industrial tax problem
under the co-ordination of the University
of Michigan's School of Business Admin-
istration. Williams quickly announced
that the report, "utterly demolishes the
claim that business is being driven out
of the state by taxation policies." Al-
though the committee later completely
contradicted Williams he had won the
first round in the steadily growing con-
flict.
Business and industry, already saddled
with a corporation franchise tax and a
business receipts tax, was not going to
sit idly by. And they didn't. On April
27 General Motors President Harlow

business were forcing GM to locate new
plants in other states. Ford, Chrysler,
American Motors, and others followed
quickly with similar statements. Of
course, the statements were timed for
the expressed purpose of having a maxi-
mum effect on the legislators, but they
were not completely unfounded. To back
up the statements, statistics show that
since World War II GM has built 13
plants in Ohio and Indiana, Chrysler
six, and Ford ten. It was also brought
out that Dow Chemical has been build-
ing oustate so much in recent years that
only half of its assets are now in Michi-
gan.
And so it continued throughout the
month of May. Both sides spouted facts
and opinions while the other side would
deny them and then produce more facts
of their own. Finally on May 27 the
issue came to a head. First, the legisla-
ture cut the tax proposal to 50 million.
Then at the last minute they dropped the
bill completely in favor of an increased
tax on whisky and cigarettes.
Slowly the issue died out during the
summer. It has not revived again this
spring mainly because both sides are
awaiting the reports of several commit-
tees that are presently studying the situ-
ation. With the committee reports not
expected until at least mid-summer, a re-
peat performance of last year's squabble
is not expected.
Is Industry Leaving?
With this background in mind let us
turn now to the question, "Is industry
leaving the state or being deterred from
coming here because of high taxes?"
The answer to this question is both yes
and no. Yes—industry is being deterred
from coming here, and no—there is not
a stampede of industry to leave the state.
The truth is that there is no net loss
of industry in Michigan today. But on
the other hand, significant growth is not
being made either. To be specific the
Michigan Economic Development Com-
mission reports that during 1955 there
was a net increase of only 20 new plants
in the state employing a total of only
2,060 men. As a comparison, the Ford
Motor Co. added 5,287 workers to its
payroll in Ohio during the same period.
The reason for this small net gain is
that a few companies are actually moving
out while a slightly larger number are
moving in. The largest industry to leave
in recent years was the American Car
and Foundry Corp., which packed up
and moved to Houston, Texas in 1955.
Another was Daisy Air Rifle which
moved from Plymouth, Michigan to
Arkansas. In both cases, high taxes were
cited as the main reason although labor
costs were a considerable factor in the
latter instance.
Another reason for the small net gain
is the fact that many companies are
expanding outside the state. Several in-
stances already have been mentioned, but
a prime example is the Wyandotte
Chemical Corp. Wyandotte is now
building a new 35 million-dollar plant
near Baton Rouge, La. The main reason
for choosing that location, according to
president Robert B. Simple, is taxes. (He
says labor costs are the same in both
Lousiana and Michigan). Because of
this tax situation, Wyandotte will pro-
duce ethylene gylcol in the new plant
and ship it all the way back to Michigan
more cheaply than they could produce it
here.
As we mentioned before, industry is
definitely being deterred from coming
into the state. According to an official of
the Development Commission the state
"is fortunate if it lands three out of
100 companies available." The largest
company to be "landed" in recent years
was the New York Air Brake Company
which now employs 700 men in Kala-
mazoo.
On the other side of the fence, one
of the biggest companies that "wasn't
landed" was a 16 million-dollar Jones
and McLaughlin Steel Corporation plant
that was to be erected near Monroe,
Mich. Main reason for building in Ohio
instead of Michigan—high taxes.
Taxes Are Main Causes
In all of these cases mentioned, high
taxes have been the deciding factor in
the decisions. For those who still doubt
the importance of high taxes in business
decisions, L. L. Colbert, president of
Chrysler Corp., says, "While many fac-
tors influence a manufacturer in locating
new plants, taxes are a critical item No
prudent management can disregard taxes
and the attitudes of taxing bodies making
plant location decisions."
In answering the question concerning
industry leaving the state, we have con-
stantly come across the expression "high
taxes." One may wonder if Michigan *
taxes are really as bad as it sounds. In
comparison with other states they defi-
nitely are. There is no doubt about it
at all. To be specific, let us consider the
accompanying chart comparing the taxes
a hypothetical 125 million dollar corpo-
ration would have to pay in four different
states, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and
Ohio on next page.
Without going through each individual
tax we can see from the totals that if
the plant were located in Michigan, the
management would have to pay almost
twice as much as it would if the plant
were in one of the other three. This is
the main reason that Michigan is fortu-
nate if it lands 3 out of 100.
Statistics available from other groups
indicate the same general results. For
instance the Pennsylvania Economy
Leagues cites figures (next page) for
a mythical 10-million-dollar corporation.
You can see that only Pennsylvania tops
Michigan. Note how we compare with
our neighbors, Ohio, Indiana, and Ili-
nois:

Along this same line President Simple
of Wyandotte Chemical reports that his
firm could have operated at the same
level in Ohio and would have had to
pay only $45,000 in state taxes compared
to $346,000 it paid in Michigan.
In other words, neighboring states are
simply offering new industries "too good
a deal" to pass up. (How they do it
without going broke will be discussed
later). Of course, it is true that Michi-
gan has many assets, including a large
labor pool, water, plenty of power, trans-
portation, raw materials, etc. The big
question is how long can these assets
offset the high taxes? It may be that
already we have reached that point.
Other Causes
So far we have examined only one
cause of Michigan's industrial problem—
high taxes. It is true that taxes are the
most important source of the trouble.
However, there are several others that
are contributing to Michigan's industrial
slowup. The key to these other causes
can be found in the statement made by
the president of Jones and McLaughlin
after they had passed up Monroe as a
plant site. He said at that time, "We
don't like the political climate in Michi-
gan."
We see that the key word is political
and soon discover that it has a double
meaning. The first implication deals with
Michigan's lack of a unified, consistent
tax system. Gov. Williams himself calls
the present structure a "patchwork of
taxes" and rightly so. Just look at the
past several years. Last year the big push
was for a corporation tax but ended up
with a whisky and cigarette levy. This
session, after some bookkeeping ma-
neuvers to get the state through the year,
the "solve-all" is an increase in the in-
tangibles tax. And so it goes from year
to year.
Each year the legislature comes up with
another patch to solve that year's money
problems. Because of this situation busi-
ness and industry cannot know what to
expect from year to year and it is im-
possible to make definite cost estimates
very far ahead. Louis Nims, head of the
state's Revenue Bureau says, "The lack
of a definite program on taxation his
probably more to do with discouraging
any company from coming to Michigan
than any tax that could have been
written."
If we were to place the blame for
this "patch work" situation anywhere it
would certainly have to rest most heavily
on the shoulders of the Republican legis-
lature. Although not completely at fault,
they have failed until recently to make
a determined effort to remedy this situ-
ation.
There is also another side to the word
political that is affecting Michigan's in-
dustrial situation. In the words of the
Detroit Free Press, "The alliance between
the Democratic administration in Lansing
and the big labor leadership has, in many
instances created an atmosphere of hos-
tility against business."
It is this alliance that has given Michi-
gan the nation-wide reputation as a
labor-run state. Surely this repuation is
not helpful in luring new industry into
the state. Of course, a Democratic gov-
ernor is expected to have a viewpoint
similar to that of labor leaders and he
is not being condemned for having such

and
YOU
The recession, although ap-
parently temporary, is having
a marked effect on job inter-
views for both summer and per-
manent positions.
Awhile ago, the Saturday Evening
Post carried an article entitled, "I
Am A Kidnapper." The author, who
wished to remain anonymous, related his
experiences in recruiting engineers for
various companies, and told of plying
the prospective employees with expen-
sive entertainment and stories of the
magnificent benefits which they would
receive should they enter the concerns.
Many magazines have printed similar
articles within the past five years, and
these have served to lull the engineering
students of today into a sense of false
security. Many tend to be complacent
about their work in college, feeling that
grades mean little or nothing, and that a
B.S. in engineering is all that is necessary
to open the door to a well-paying job
for them. This has been more or less
true in the past, for there has been a
considerable demand for graduate engi-
neers. However, the picture is now
changing, and future graduates may find
that a good job is not so easy to come by.
The effects of the change in available
jobs will probably be felt the greatest
by this June's graduating class. The rea-
son for this is that the United States is
now undergoing a recession which has
produced a substantial change in the
number of job openings in all fields
including engineering. A great many of
the companies throughout the United
States which have engineers working for
them will be hiring only from fifty to
sixty-five per cent of the employees that
they did in a 1957. The Wall Street
Journal surveyed forty companies a few
months ago and found that two-thirds
of them will hire fewer men than they
did last year. Most of them were reluc-
tant to disclose the number of engineers
by DIANA ARMINTROUT, '61E
which they will be hiring, but figure
were obtained from ten of the companies,
and these showed that the ten will hire
644 men this year as compared to 1359
last year.
Even though recruiting efforts are still
high, they do show a marked decrease
from 1957. In that year various com-
panies scheduled 435 interviews through
the University of Michigan's Engineering
Placement Office. This spring there were
around four hundred scheduled visits,
but as of March 12, sixty-six of them
had been cancelled. Virtually all of the
cancellations were made because of the
lack of jobs to justify a visit. This leaves
about one hundred fewer interviews i*
the U. of M this year than there were
last year. It might be interesting to note
here a list of the cancellations by indus-
try which have been received so far this
spring:
Aircraft 4
Mechanical Manufacturing 21
Electrical 4
Chemical 14
Iron and Steel 6
Federal Agencies 6
Utilities 4
The lack of jobs does not seem to be
common to only one or two industries,
but has affected all of them Even the
companies which have not cancelled in-
terviews are becoming more selective in
their interviewing. The present situation
of several companies was given by Pro-
fessor J. Young who heads the U. of
M.'s Engineering Placement Office, and
will be related here:
Alcoa — Cancelled eighteen schools
12
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


they are continuing recruiting efforts in
other schools throughout the country.
U. S. Navy, Bureau of Ships—Will
hire twenty men this year, vs. forty men
last year.
Oil Industry in General—Quite tight,
but it is still hiring for research and
development.
Electronics—Hit hard earlier in the
fall, but it is recovering now. R.C.A.
cancelled all of its interviews last fall,
but it now hopes to hire two hundred
men.
Detroit Edison—Now wants about one
third as many as last year.
General Motors — The requirements
are down forty per cent from last year.
Pharmaceutical Companies — The re-
quirements are about the same as last
year. This is also true of Proctor and
Gamble and American Cyanimid.
Worthington Pump Company — Re-
ports that it has received seventy per cent
acceptances to its job offers, whereas last
year it had only twenty per cent accep-
tances.
Nearly every industry has felt the
change. If their requirements haven t
been cut, many of them such as Olin
Matheson are taking advantage of the
plentiful material and are considering
only the upper one third of the gradu-
ating class. It seems that most of the
industries want fewer men and better
men with an emphasis on the better.
Three factors are mainly responsible
for the change in the employment per-
spective for enginering graduates. They
are: the business conditions in general,
i.e., the recession; the defense contract
curtailment in the latter part of 1957;
and the increased number of graduates.
A rise is expected in defense contracts,
so it is expected that some companies will
soon be hiring back to normal. However,
it is not so easy to predict what will
happen as far as business conditions go.
Things could conceivably get better, stay
the same, or undergo another slump, and
so it is only a guess as to what will
happen.
Although there are fewer job offers
to be had, those who do find jobs will
be offered approximately the same pay
as last year. The average starting salary
is now around $470 per month for engi-
neers with B.S. degrees. M.S. and Ph.D.
graduates will be offered $550 and $740
per month, respectively.
The class which graduated last Janu-
ary did not feel the effects of the current
recession as badly as the June class will
for two reasons. First, the companies
make out their quotas before they begin
Diana Armintrout, a freshman in
Chemical Engineering, is a gradu-
ate of Allegan High School, Alle-
gan, Mich. While in high school
Diana participated in many activi-
ties, including Student Council,
newspaper, yearbook, Pep Club,
Latin Club, and Tri-Hi-Y.
Diana says she has many in-
terests and hobbies but particularly
enjoys painting, cooking, sewing,
and horseback riding. Although
working towards a B.S. degree in
Chemical Engineering she may
enter the field of technical writing
after graduation.
to hire the fall graduates. They then
expect to partially fill these with fall
graduates and complete them with spring
graduates. At the time that the require-
ments were drawn up, business condi-
tions were not as they are today and so
the quotas were comparable to those of
other years. However, many companies,
after they had hired the fall graduates,
found that their quotas had to be re-
duced. Thus now there are relatively
fewer jobs open to the class which will
be graduated in June. Another factor is
that there are always many more graduates
in June than in the fall, so that more
people will be clamoring for the fewer
available jobs. Although it has been
stated that the January graduates did not
feel the lack of jobs as much as the
June graduates will, statistics show that
at the U. of M. there was a thirty per
cent decrease in the number of job offers
received in the fall of 1957 and com-
pared to the fall of 1956. In 1956, 205
job offers were made to B. S. degree
holders, whereas in 1957, only 146 offers
were made.
The future is uncertain, but one thing
is sure. That is that the spring graduates
are certainly going to feel the brunt of
the current recession. Whether they will
be the only class to do so or not is a
good question. No one really knows.
Most companies are optimistic and feel
that there will be higher requirements
next year, but this is only a guess.
The only thing to do is to stand pat.
There are jobs available for better men,
but those who have a lower class stand-
ing may have a considerably harder time.
Since it is now too late to improve their
records as far as grades are concerned,
they must be very serious about job
hunting and take particular pains to
schedule interviews if they hope to ob-
tain a job.
The long range view is upward. In
future years more and more engineers
will be needed, but it must also be re-
membered that there will be many more
students in colleges throughout the
United States. This recession is tempo-
rary, and will probably affect very few
classes, but it might well mark the end
of an era—an era when all a man
needed was a B.S. degree and a slide rule
to have companies fighting over him like
dogs over a bone. The graduate of the
future may find that his college record
will determine his ability to secure the
job that he wants—or one at all, for that
matter.

Decisions, decisions, decisions . . . every en-
gineer should be familiar with the scientific
way of tackling those problems which lie out-
side the realm of formulas.
by BRYAN WHIPPLE, '61E
Never before have so many engi-
neers entered managerial positions
as do today. Even the term "Engineer"
has lost its former connotation of tran-
sits and hip boots in favor of implica-
tions of mahogany desks and jangling
telephones (at least in the dreams of
most students). This is doubtless in part
due to the discovery by commerce and
industry that the nature of an engineer-
ing education is such that it produces
men who are well-equipped to solve cer-
tain types of problems. However, engi-
neers who are fortunate enough to be-
come managers with a considerable
degree of responsibility will find that
skill in decision-making is as necessary
as ability to solve problems. These two
managerial functions are closely related,
but the former requires choosing between
a multiplicity of solutions, while the
latter implies a more or less mathematical
tracking-down of the one possible an-
swer. In order that the engineer be able
to tackle decision-making situations where
there is no formula or table to point the
way, let us present a basic decision-
maker's outline.
Decisions and the problems from
which they arise are of many sorts, but
they seem to fall into three major cate-
gories. Since each of these types require
a different approach if they are to be
solved efficiently, this division is both
convenient and necessary, and will be
referred to again.
First, there are many decisions which
we make spontaneously. Fortunately, the
problems which trigger these decisions
are usually relatively trivial. Often one
will arrive at the solution to a problem
which he did not consciously realize.
They are autonomic responses over which
the conscious mind has little control.
While they are of interest to psycholo-
gists, these "snap decisions" are an
inalterable part of the personality for our
purposes, and we shall only hope that
they don't suddenly compel some unfor-
tunate engineer to "tell off" the boss.
The second type of decision involves
more or less thought to produce a solu-
tion, but is limited to instances in which
there are only two possibilities. Either
an action is taken, or it is not taken—
either solution "A" is chosen, or solution
"B." The logical term for this type of
problem is "dilemma" which, however,
does not necessarily imply that one must
choose the lesser of two evils, but merely
that there are but two possible answers,
both clearly defined.
The third type of decision, possibly
the most frequently encountered, is also
usually the most difficult to arrive at.
More often than not, when a problem
exists, there are no clear-cut solutions
to choose between, but rather a number
of roads to the desired objective. Fur-
ther, none of the conceivable solutions
is necessarily correct to the exclusion of
all others. One solution might be 97
per cent satisfactory, another 91 per cent,
and so forth. Perhaps there is a solution
which will give complete satisfaction, but
more often than not no answer can be
deemed ideal. Even if we admit the
existence of an ideal solution to such a
problem, perhaps it will never occur
during the search for alternative solu-
tions. In order to say whether a decision
to such a multifaceted problem is satis-
factory, arbitrary standards must be estab-
lished, for there is no black and white
division between success and failure.
An interesting example of this type of
problem is related by the United States
Chamber of Commerce in the description
of the problem faced by a small manu-
facturer of plumbing fixtures. Despite
skyrocketing sales, his business was be-
coming steadily less profitable until
eventually he was faced with the threat
of bankruptcy. He traced the source of
his woes to his small, overcrowded fac-
tory which was operating at very low
efficiency. Expansion of his old plant
was impractical because he was located
in a crowded district. The solution
seemed clear to the manufacturer: merely
build a larger factory at another site.
This he did, and as a result he was out
of business within a year.
Although his diagnosis of the problem
was correct, this manufacturer failed to
consider any but the most obvious solu-
tion to a problem which falls in our
third category: he expanded in a manner
which he was not financially sound
enough to risk in his condition at the
time.
Any number of alternatives were it
his disposal. He could have sublet the
work which his old plant was not able
to handle until he was in better financial
shape. He could have rented a building
rather than making the cash outlay for
the new one. He could have capitalized
on his standing in the market by ceasing
all manufacturing operations and becom-
ing a distributor for another manufac-
turer. Or he might have sought a merger
with a company which had adequate pro-
duction facilities but not a large enough
slice of the market, combining his mar-
keting skill with the productive genius
of another.
But the actual technique of problem
solving should not begin with the study
of alternative solutions. Rather, we must
begin by defining the problem in exact
terms. Problems are often like icebergs—

tentially dangerous part, is not apparent
on cursory inspection. It is here that
decision-making skill is put to its severest
test. A capacity for acute observation
and alertness to conditions that indicate
possible problems in advance is needed.
These qualities do not arise from experi-
ence, but rather from a learned and well-
rounded familiarity with the subject
matter. Experience only serves to teach
us to use these faculties of grasping
problems. An inexperienced man may
have an advantage over an experienced
man in recognizing problems if he is
adequately educated and is alert. Experi-
ence sometimes leads to the mistaken
belief that a solution which once proved
satisfactory can be applied to an appar-
ently identical problem, whereas the new
problem is more than likely only super-
ficially similar, and can be solved only
by one who perceives its submerged
facets.
There is a single tool which will en-
able the businessman to see what the
exact problem is in the majority of cases.
This is "critical-factor analysis." Accord-
ing to Nation's Business, April 1956, the
critical factor is the one element in a
problem which has to be changed,
moved, or removed before anything else
can be done. Only when this factor is
isolated does one come to grips with the
real problem.
Nation's Business cites as an example
of the success of critical-factor analysis
a large company which had appointed
eight men in a period of ten years to its
number two office, executive vice presi-
dent. All manner of men had been tried
at the post: young and old, forceful and
meek, company men and outsiders. When
the president recommended a ninth can-
didate to the board of directors it was
suggested that, instead, the board should
investigate why eight good men had
failed.
One of the board members set out to
interview each of the former office-
holders, and rapidly discovered that the
critical factor was the president himself.
"While he had delegated all responsi-
bility to the executive vice-president and
refused to make any decisions he still
tried to hold the full authority of the
chief executive office, expected the vice-
presidents to report to him and only to
him, issued orders without informing the
executive vice-president and altogether
behaved as if he were still the actual
operating head of the business."
The critical factor was that the re-
sponsibility of the job was far greater
than the actual authority. It was solved
by promoting the president to chairman
of the board where he would have au-
thority over major policy, but not over
operating decisions. One of the men who
had failed as vice-president was given
his job.
Once the problem is clearly stated, the
next step is to define the end results
hoped for. This is an absolutely neces-
sary step before solutions can be pro-
posed. A solution is not an end in itself,
but merely a path between the end result
and the problem. We have defined the
problem, now we must define our expec-
tations so that we may have two points
between which different solution-paths
might be tested. Also, having the de-
sired effect carefully written out helps
us decide whether a proposed solution
will eliminate the problem, or whether it
is merely a good idea that missed the
boat.
When defining your expectations, it is
necessary to consider your potentialities
and those of your department and firm.
Bryan Whipple, a frequent con-
tributor to the Michigan Technic,
comes to the University from
Cooley High School in Detroit.
While in high school, Bryan par-
ticipated in American Field Service,
journalistic activities, Radio Club,

freshman in the industrial engi-
neering program, Bryan is inter-
ested in radio, electronics, outdoor
sports, and philosophy.
Although it is generally healthy to aim
high, no one should establish irrational
goals or his failure will be abject.
Before embarking on a discussion of
solutions, it is well to pass along some
pointers suggested by the U. S. Chamber
of Commerce. The Chamber advises
management not to depend on facts.
Facts are derived from past events and
are important only to the extent to which
they can influence the future, which is
considerably less than one might expect.
Floods of facts and figures strangle busi-
ness meetings and prevent forward-look-
ing, progressive thinking. If one has
defined his expectations clearly, he should
find little trouble weeding out relevant
facts from irrelevant. Truly important
facts are seldom available for business
decision-making. If the facts are avail-
able, you are involved with good old-
fashioned mathematical problem-solving.
We are concerned with the more psychic
problems, which do not easily reduce to
mathematical expressions. Assumptions
are far more valuable in solving the
usual top-level business problems. Only
rarely is it justified to worry that one is
deciding on the basis of too few facts
and too many assumptions; such is sel-
dom the case.
The timing of a decision is a factor
of no small consequence. Invariably, a
decision made today will not achieve
exactly the same ends that the same de-
cision would have made a month ago, or
a month hence. Conversely, a given goal
requires a new approach from time to
time. Timing is important from a stra-
tegic standpoint also. The decision to
produce a new model or improve one's
product should be timed so as to catch
the competition off balance. Decisions
to improve worker conditions are more
prevalent just before contract negotiation
time. Decisions to expand are convenient
when it is time to prepare copy for a
prospectus or an annual report. Only
take note that a decision may be made
too early almost as easily as too late.
Frequent indications of decisions made
too early (but not necessarily too hastily)
are failure of the market to respond,
tipping off the competition, or extreme
inaccuracy of the assumptions on which
it is based. Usually when a decision is
put off until too late, the opportunity for
any decision is gone. At best, late de-
cision will require a costly crash program
to catch up with competitors who did
not procrastinate.
By the time that the process of reach-
ing a decision has been carried this far,

Wall Street
. . . . and discovers that there is more to the
stock market than meets the eye.
by JAY SKLAR, '60E
The New York stockmarket, trading
place for millions of shares in
America's businesses weekly, might well
be a mystery to an engineering student.
Here, in a room one-half the size of a
football field, millions of dollars change
hands every day. Here the big men of
finance may go broke or gain thousands
of dollars in a few hours. Yet there is
a place in the stockmarket for the little
man too. At the end of 1956, 8,630,000
people owned shares in publicly held
corporations. Although the student engi-
neer might not be thinking along those
lines today, he might in only a few
years be in a position to become part-
owner in a giant corporation.
Still, the stockmarket is no guarantee
to huge fortunes. If used wisely, it can
lead to a comfortable retirement fund
in the future. If used unwisely, it can
lead to a loss of important capital.
Therefore, the engineer should be made
aware of the do's and don'ts of invest-
ing in order that he may gain us much
as possible with the least chance of loss.
Long range investment plans must be
made in accordance with total income.
The man who earns $10,000 or $20,000
a year will have a different viewpoint
from the $5,000 a year man. And the
person in a still higher income bracket
will have other considerations to make.
Generally speaking, it is not wise for
the low earner to enter the stock mar-
ket. It is true that a few people starting
with nothing have, by careful manipula-
tion and a good deal of luck, worked
themselves up to the high income
brackets. But this is not likely for the
average individual. Just as many have
lost all their savings by careless financial
maneuvering.
While keeping his savings in the stock-
market may enable the $5,000 a year
man to receive more interest than in
other fields of investment and perhaps
even enable him to increase his capital
to some degree, he must remember that
the market fluctuates considerably. A
person in this income bracket should
have his savings where they may be
converted to ready cash immediately.
Illness, temporary loss of job, or other
emergency of this type can call for thees
extra funds without regard to economic
ups and downs. If there is any chance
that invested capital might be needed on
short notice, or even at some specific
time a long way ahead, this money
should not be invested. Government
savings bonds return only 2C/,,* annually,
but they may be redeemed at any time
for exactly what was paid. One will
never be forced to sell savings bonds
below original price.
Let us hope, however, that the engi-
neer will soon progress out of the $5,000
a year range. Once he is beyond this
minimum salary group, his entire invest-
ment picture changes. He will have suf-
ficient surplus funds to diversify his sav-
ings and be able to divide them between
savings bonds and common stocks.
Just what are the advantages of com-
mon stocks, though, one might ask? The

interest rates are not much greater than
those of savings bonds and there is the
risk of losing capital. Certainly the in-
creased interest is not sufficient to offset
the gamble.
Common stocks have one big advan-
tage over government bonds and insur-
ance. They are an excellent protection
against inflation. The value of capital
invested in bonds and insurance will
always remain the same. Even if the cost
of living index soars, the investor in
these securities will still have his original
sum. Thus, if $100 is invested in bonds
or insurance at 3% interest, after ten
years, the investor will have only his
$100 capital plus, of course, the accrued
interest. Suppose, however, the cost of
living has increased 40% in that time.
(This is roughly what has happened in
the past ten years.) Now the bond in-
vestor will have his $100 but its pur-
chasing power will be only a fraction
of what it had been ten years before.
Now let us consider the stock investor.
He also invests $100, but instead of buy-
ing bonds with his capital he invests in
"blue chips" stock—stock in companies
that have been runninig smoothly for
many years. In this type of investment
the chance of loss is almost nil, but he
has the added protection against infla-
tion. During the ten year span the stock
investor has also been getting dividends.
Perhaps, if he chose one of the "blue
chips," he will be getting more interest
than on his savings bonds. In addition,
since a rise of the cost of living produces
a corresponding rise in the stockmarket.
16
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


at the end of ten years he will have the
same purchasing power as he had when
he started instead of the same dollar
value.
The $10,000 to $20,000 a year man
is in the ideal position for investment.
He has enough capital to divide his
funds between common stocks and sav-
ings bonds. While his stocks may be
protecting him against inflation, his
bonds are protecting him against sudden
emergencies. He is thus doubly pro-
tected.
If the individual is earning $10,000 a
year, it is considered best to have two-
thirds of one's total investment in com-
mon stock. He will not be likely to have
to sell when the market is low since he
has other funds at his disposal. In this
way he will be able to afford all market
fluctuations, not only small ones.
One might think that a man earning
520,000 should invest a greater percent-
age of his funds in stock. However, this
is not true. A person in this position
is interested in being protected against
any eventuality since, in most cases, he
is somewhat older than men of lower
income. His investment represents his
retirement funds and if a deep recession
hits the nation he wold be forced to sell
at extremely low prices. With a fair
percentage of his savings in bonds, he
could live off this capital, waiting for
the market to rise.
Now that we have mentioned the
various income groups and given some
indication as to what their respective
places are in the stockmarket, we might
say something about the three basic types
of investing. The most conservative of
these types is income investing. With
a fair amount of capital, the investor
can put his money into reliable, high
dividend paying stocks. There are marty
companies which have paid over five
percent annually for a number of years
and as they are run by sound business-
men and have a solid basis for their
income, there is no reason to believe
they will not continue to do so. Follow-
ing this method of investing, the indi-
vidual can supplement his income by a
few dollars annually and at the same
time protect himself against inflation.
Income investing will, of course, bring
no one any substantial, sudden financial
gain. Stocks considered for this purpose
continue smoothly along maintaining the
status quo. Somewhat more daring, but
with the added advantage of greatly in-
creasing capital, is investment in growth
companies. Growth companies are those
young, promising corporations with great
initiative that will sometime in the fu-
ture become large, expansive organiza-
tions. Although immediate dividend pay-
ments cannot be expected, promise of
substantial capital gain and significant
dividend payments in the years to come
makes ownership of these stocks desir-
able. There have been many cases of
original capital being multiplied several
times in three, five, or ten years after a
small outfit got established. This is the
surest way to make really considerable
gains on the stockmarket, but it is also
risky. Prediction of future success for
any company cannot be one hundred
percent certain. There is the chance that
the investor's estimate of a company's
worth may be all wrong and that in
several months, the organization has
gone bankrupt. Nevertheless, careful in-
vesting in growth companies can bring
the stockholder significant increases in
his capital.
The last general investment procedure
is speculating. While the greatest profit
can be made through speculation, there
is a tremendous risk. Most of the ex-
perts agree that one must not speculate
unless he can afford to lose all the money
he invests. Hundreds of people have
lost all their money in the uranium com-
panies of Western United States and
Canada.
Speculation is defined as the act of
doing business on the basis of temporary
price fluctuations rather than on the
basis of sound business investment. By
a careful study of prices and the social
factors which influence them, the specu-
lator will buy stocks when the prices are
low, waiting to sell them until the prices
rise. Conversely, when they see a fall
in the offing, they sell, waiting .until
prices are low to buy again. In this
field of business, large sums of money
are necessary to make noticeable amounts
since a rise of only a few dollars is til
that can be expected at average condi-
tions. However, this sum can be reduced
by "marginal buying"—that is, borrow-
ing a part of the stock value from the
broker until the stocks are sold. This
is where the danger comes in. If the
market drops, the broker is likely to
demand cash for the amount he has lost
by the fall and will. If you cannot
supply the demand, keep some of your
stocks. Nevertheless, this type of mar-
ginal buying has been reduced somewhat
by government regulations calling for
almost the full sale price of the stock
at the time of purchase.
For the average stockholder, as the
future engineer is likely to be, specula-
tion is not a good idea. He will not
have sufficient capital to make significant
gains, but he will be taking a huge risk
with money he might be saving for re-
tirement or emergency.
In recent years a procedure known as
"dollar averaging" has come about.
Roughly defined this might be described
as a system procedure for buying stocks
to get the most for your dollar. As a
plan for investment for the engineer,
it is almost ideal.
Since the prices fluctuate so rapidly
and since there is no way to tell exactly
what will be happening in the future,
the experts feel that buying regularly
without regard to price is the best sys-
tem. The investor should decide at the
beginning of each year just what he will

ITS PROBLEMS
Small business, once the backbone of Amer-
ica but now beset with a recession, high taxes,
and competition with big industry, is looking
at its future with concern.
by ROGER BARNES, '61E
Though encountering new and ever-
pressing problems every day, small
busineses in the United States // not a
thing of the past. On the contrary, it
is a thing of the future—a basic foun-
dation of Americal free enterprise upon
which our economic system may depend.
The growth of labor unions and large-
scale industry, as well as the recently de-
clining economy of the country, has
brought the status of this small business
into sharp focus. These situations, what-
ever their effect upon the small firms,
are met by both small business and the
government, so that the future of the
small enterprise can hope for an allevi-
ation of these and other problems.
Most people tend to associate the term
"small business" with such enterprises as
the independent grocery stores, shoe re-
pair shops, and the "corner drug store."
These are but stereotypes of small busi-
ness. There are others engaged in the
production and selling of a broader range
of products, some of which are essential
to our everyday life. Moreover, small
business is not to be associated with the
little 2x4 shack, whose sole proprietor
is just barely struggling along. Because
of the necessity of having some clear
definition of small business, various
agencies of the Federal government have
devised several which sometimes vary
slightly from each other.
This clarification of business is neces-
sary particularly in war times when large
numbers of governmental contracts are
given out to certain industries and firms
for the production of vital war materials.
Taxation of each business is also de-
pendent upon its classification. One such
definition is used by the Small Business
Administration in Washington, D.C.,
whose purpose is to provide financial aid
by loaning money and obtaining govern-
mental contracts for small business as
well as to counsel small firm owners in
the technical aspects and management
and production techniques of a small
company. The SBA follows a policy of
defining small business in terms of its
employees, assets, and profits with re-
spect to the industry in which the firm
operates.
Definition is of Prime Importance
For all practical purposes and for the
layman ,the term small business may be
applied to any firm under the following
restrictions: 1) volume of business is
below one million dollars; 2) total assets
are less than 500,000; 3) employees
number less than 250, though 98% of
all business have less than 50 employees
and 45% have no employees at all except
the owner; 4) management is under the
control of the owner with no underlying
control such as stockholders; 5) finances
do not extend into securities but instead
into commercial credit extended by the
government and local lending agencies;
6) operation is primarily local. By the
above restrictions, about 90% of all
American firms can be classified as small
business. It can therefore be seen that
small business does indeed play a large
role in the business world of the nation.
Not only do small businesses provide
us with a variety of specialized services
and products, but they also help to keep
down the prices of other commodities.
This is the direct result of their compe-
tition with the large companies. Prices
are lowered and the quality of the
product is improved as well as the pro-
duction techniques of the producer.
While big business finds definite com-
petition with the smaller firms, they are
also quite aware that they themselves are
dependent upon the success of the small
businesses. The latter are quite often
the suppliers of parts and materials for
the large industry as well as being i
market and buyer for the produced raw
product. This is dramatically illustrated
by the dependence of the Du Pont Com-
pany upon little business. Nine-tenths
of its 75,000 customers and 30,000 sup-
pliers are small companies.
The Engineer and Small Business
It is this cooperation with the small
firms that an engineer in a large industry
must be aware of for two reasons. For
one, it is from these businesses that all
raw materials must come, for generally
the larger industry cannot afford to invest
money in these subsidiary productions.
One has only to examine the variety of
materials and parts in an automobile to
realize this. Most of them probably came
not from the factory of the automobile
manufacturer but rather from a smaller
company whose major concern is this par-
ticular part or product. Secondly, the

engineer in industry, particularly those in
sales work, must realize that it is through
these small firms that their products will
be sold. Automobiles, for example, are
sold through small independent dis-
tributors all over the nation. In the case
of the Du Pont products, the raw dacron
yarn is certainly not of any use directly
to a consumer. It is the smaller firms
that make textiles and garments from
this raw yarn. It is then quite obvious
that if many large scale industries are
to survive, their subsidiary firms must
also be successful. To this end, much
financial aid is given by the large com-
panies for research and for the support
of small business in the United States.
Growth of Small Business
Small business has had its place in
the country ever since the Pilgrims
started trading beads and mirrors for
food and animal skins from the Indian
over three hundred years ago. For about
two hundred years thereafter, the econ-
omy and welfare of the United States
was propagated by small business, which
turned out inexpensive, yet durable
goods, essential to the home and also
to the nation in times of war.
Toward the latter half of the nine-
teenth century, however, businesses be-
gan to merge forming large corporations
and mass production techniques soon
appeared. Now goods could be made
Roger Barnes, President of the
Class of 61 'E, is the author of the
report on the future of the small
business. Roger is a graduate of

dianapolis where he was a member

inexpensively while at the same time the
tremendous overheads and other operat-
ing costs were reduced. Small business
was suddenly faced with a mammoth
problem, that of competing with big
business. The most immediately notice-
able effect was upon the volume of busi-
ness conducted by small business as com-
pared to the total business of all industry
together. Nevertheless, the number of
small firms in operation ever since the
turn of the century has remained rela-
tively steady with the population increase.
In 1900, data compiled by Dun &amp;
Bradstreet shows that there were 1,174,-
300 businesses in operation for a popu-
lation in the United States of 76 million.
This gives about 15 enterprises per 1000
people. This figure rose for about five
years, remained steady for another fifteen
years, then increased to 18.17 in 1929-
Due to the depression of that year and
the effects afterwards during the nine-
teen thirties, this figure fell to just above
15 again. Advancing slightly toward the
latter half of that decade, the number of
small businesses in operation has not
changed considerably since.
Though it would seem that during the
war years, the number of units in oper-
ation would increase, it does not show.
The draft no doubt had an important
effect, preventing young men from be-
ginning new establishments. However,
though this stayed the same during the
wars, the volume of business conducted
by these businesses already in operation
took a big increase. This was in part
the result of governmental contracts for
necessary war materials. Moreover, since
many large industries stopped producing
civilian commodities during these years,

volume of business along these lines.
The present day number of businesses
has of late been beclouded by the reces-
sion, which has actually effected all busi-
ness in general. In the middle of 1957,
figures reported 4,322,000 units in the
country, of which one-sixth were not in
existance ten years before.
We might also examine the trend of
business failures over this same period,
which vary much more widely than the
above set of data. From the turn of the
century to 1932 the number of failures
increased from about 11,000 to 32,000,
rising steadily. However, because of the
aforementioned large amount of business
conducted during the war years, notably
the Second World War, this number was
reduced to an all-time low of about
1,000 in 1945. For the past ten years,
this number has again been going up.
As reported by Dun &amp; Bradsteet, an in-
crease of 8% over 1956 was evident in
1957—in figures this represents a change
from 1,686 to 13,739. Most of these
failures were in the construction indus-
try and in other home furnishing, build-
ing material, and hardware firms pri-
marily because of the drop in the num-
ber of housing starts. Manufacturing
likewise suffered an increase of 3%
higher in 1956.
Small Business Administration figures
available for the first three months of
1958 show an increase again of 9-3^&lt;
above this 1957 rate. In other words,
since 1945, when about 1,000 failures
were recorded, the number has been in-
creasing steadily.
Over the past ten years, the number
of businesses that were incorporated has
also decreased. After a slight drop
around 1950, when the draft call went
out again, the total incorporations per
year has risen continuously until 1955-
1956 when it leveled off. In 1956, how-
ever, a drop of 3% under 1956 was
noted and figures for January of 1958
indicate a still further decrease. The
effectiveness of these figures in drawing
a picture of the success of business is
unfortunately inadequate, since they in-
clude both the newly incorporated firms,
and also other old companies already in
operation but are just becoming incor-
porated.
Future Forsees Solution of Problems

Index based on new i
problems to be solved. One is the tax-
ation of small business. For example,
under the present revenue act, heavy
taxes are imposed upon business which
are incorporated while another firm under
a partnership and which may gross much
more profits per year does not have to
pay this tax. At the present time, there
is legislation before Congress to alleviate
this and other problems relating to taxes.
Other pressing problems include the
availability of credit to small businesses,
of which there has been a lack lately;
government contracts and price conces-
sions that should be more favorable to
the small business; and the monopolistic
practices of big business which threaten
the little businessman in many industries.
Should legislation to solve the above
problems be passed and with the con-
tinued help of the Small Business Ad-
ministration, a brighter future for small
business can be predicted. It seems most
likely that great success will be most felt
in the services and construction industries.
Both will be the direct result of the in-
creasing population of the United States,
people who will be needing new homes,
furnishings, and repairmen to service
their appliances as well as cleaners, laun-
dries, medical supply houses to meet their
everyday needs.
According to Wendell B. Barnes. Ad-
ministrator of the Small Business Admin-
istration, the above problems "are really
challenges, a part of our free, competi-
tive society. When they are solved, comes
the satisfaction of personal accomplish-
ment."

Proctor and Gamble is presently the
only company using this markedly ad-
vantageous design method. The article
below was condensed from a talk given
by a U. of M. graduate ('43), who is
behind this remarkable development at
P. &amp; G.
edited by JOHN RICHARDS, '61E
In the past few years there have been
remarkable changes in industry, im-
proved chemical processing, high speed
machinery, electronic advances, and im-
provements in almost all phases of manu-
feature and design. All of these changes
required engineering, but it is peculiar
that the techniques used in engineering
in general have resisted change. Most
companies still make fabulous numbers
of drawings in the same conventional
manner that they did years ago. Of
course, there has been improvements in
drafting equipment and techniques, but
any two-dimensional drawing, no matter
how advanced, presents problems in
visualization that are troublesome and
time-consuming. There is also the com-
plicated problem of coordinating the
phases represented by each individual
drawing into the composite final product.
The Proctor and Gamble Company has
developed a method which eliminates
almost all of the drawbacks arising from
the use of old-style drawings. By using
three-dimensional, exact scale models in
place of drawings, we save time, money,
and eliminate problems of visualization
and coordination.
It all begins with an idea in the head
of a research or development man. He-
might come up with a new product, an
improvement to a product, or an easier
and lower cost way of producing an
existing product. Usually considerable
more development must be carried out
before the idea is ready to be transformed
into a production unit. In addition to
development and pilot plant work, a
whole team of specialists come into play.
This team is made up of people from
manufacturing, sales, advertising, and en-
gineering. All of these people work to-
gether to determine in what area the
facility might be located to produce the
lowest cost product, considering freight
and raw material costs. A forecast of
how much product it might be possible
to sell helps establish the size of the
required facility and the engineers work
to establish a practical process for a pro-
duction unit along with an estimate of
the cost of the required size plant. Once
go ahead is obtained, manufacturing
gives its sub-contractor, the Engineering
Division, final conclusions on what
products are wanted, how much capacity
is wanted and one or more possible sites
which appear desirable from market sur-
veys. Research and Development give
the engineers their latest concept of how
to make the proposed product. This in-
formation is in the form of a basic flow
diagram.
This basic information is used during
the Project Definition Period, when the
models first come into play to help all
concerned visualize the problems more
easily. Two types of models are made
during this period, pilot plan models
and preliminary equipment arrangement
models. A pilot plan model is a pretty
simple- but effective tool. It is made to
do just what the name implies, study out
the plot plan or layout of a whole fac-
tory or major portion. The biggest ad-
vantage to this type of model is that
many alternative plans can be studied by
the engineer directly on the model with-
out trying to reflect his thinking through
a draftsman.
Once the engineering specialists arrive
at alternative layouts which have been
analyzed as the most favorable, they are
presented to the manufacturing organiza-
tion in a model review. Out of this re-
view comes an approval of one of the
plans and thus, a clear go-ahead for the
project.
Having arrived at an overall plot plan
arrangement, the next step is to define
the layouts in each individual area, such
as a tank field or processing building.
To do this, a preliminary equipment
arrangement model is built instead of
studying with conventional drawings.
Although still simple in shap&gt;e, it is built
to a larger scale, and therefore, most of
the equipment can be effectively repre-
sented.
On these models, as on the Plot Plan
Models, speed is considered very impor-
tant, and they are kept simple but func-
tional. The engineers do their thinking
and study work directly on the model
themselves, instead of trying to reflect
their thoughts through a draftsman. In
addition to developing the best possible
operating unit, the engineers and other
members of the team try to study out
problems which will affect the specifica-
tion and sizing of equipment. Just is
with the Plot Plan Model, a camera can
be used to record and present the various
plans. When the alternatives have been
explored and the best plan developed
and approved in a model review, the
model represents the equipment layout
and as such the basis for structural de-
sign. Of course, during the study stage
the civil engineers have been contributing
as a part of the team, making suggestions
as to what the most economical struc-
tural alternative might be.
In general, much better and more firm
layouts can be arrived at in a shorter

equipment models than could be obtained
with conventional drawings.
Once the preliminary equipment ar-
rangement model is approved there is a
period when designs which are not
modeled must be drawn up. The process
flow diagram which until now was in a
very fluid preliminary state must be com-
pleted in detail and the tanks, pressure
vessels and other equipment shown by
blocks on the model must be specified
and or designed. Structural and archi-
tectural drawings must be prepared and
the electrical wiring diagrams must be
drawn up. Once this work is well under-
way, but not necessarily all complete, the
Production Engineering model gets under
way.
We have standardized on a scale of
y4" to the foot for our Production Engi-
neering models. This scale has been
chosen for two reasons. First, it has been
found by experience to be large enough
to show the detail which we feel is
necessary and secondly, it is a convenient
scale where 1/16" on the model repre-
sents 1" actual, and this is the tolerance
that we work toward.
The first step in building a production
engineering model is the construction of
the basic model. The basic model is just
what the name implies, a base on which
to install the various pipes, conduit, and
duct systems. This basic model repre-
sents about 25% of the total modeling
effort, and it is important that it be
accurate because the remaining 75% of

fitter at a glance the material and size
of each pipe line.
modeling effort is built up on it. The
equipment and structure are built from
equipment drawings. Materials of con-
struction are usually clear plastic because
of the ease of fabrication.
Before the piping installation is started
the basic model is thoroughly reviewed
and checked. A final review by all con-
cerned is held to be sure that the facility
will suit their needs. Once all these con-
tributions have been obtained, the de-
sign team starts work.
The piping is usualy the first item
which is installed. Piping is represented
by plastic rod or tubing whose outside
diameter is the scale dimension of the
pipe. Insulation is represented by sleeves
attached to the plastic at random spots.
This method is referred to as the "True-
scale Technique." Until recently, prac-
tically all of our models were built using
fine wire to represent pipe because of
the speed of construction and the ease
with which changes could be made. Since
our whole modeling approach centers on
using a model to study out the best de-
sign it is important that the model be
easily changed. We have recently been
developing a true scale technique using
plastic tubing and cast fittings which will
be assembled in sort of a tinker-toy
fashion and thus, hopefully give us a
true scale model with speed. The obvious
advantage of true-scale, of course, is the
improved visualization and resultant bet-
ter job in both engineering and con-
struction.
No matter which technique is used,
the modeling designer uses the same ap-
proach at working out the design on the
model from the flow diagram with few
or no piping studies drawn on paper.
The thinking is actually done on the
model. This is an important concept.
Our engineers must train themselves to
think this way to make full use of the
model as an engineering tool. As the
designs begins to take shape other phases
are brought under study and thereby re-
flected on the model. Any chutes and
ducts are studied out on the model and
the power conduit is taken into consider-
ation. Normally, it is wrong to let any
phase have dominant control of space, so
all must be worked together to achieve
the best design.
As the Production Engineering pro-
gresses on the model the engineering
specialists are continually studying the
work to be sure that the design represents
the thinking which they had developed
during the project definition stage and
difficult design details are solved. We
feel that this is important and is one

ble, can be seen on the second floor

of the big advantages of modeling, in
that the engineer is easily able to review
the design as it progresses without the
burden to follow a large number of
drawings as they are being drawn. The
engineer is thus freer to concentrate on
more interesting and rewarding problems.
Since the model is the method of com-
municating the design intent to the con-
struction forces on piping, conduit,
chutes, and ducts it has to be very com-
plete. A list of the items which are
included in our models will show what
is meant. In addition to the basic model
which consists of the equipment and
structure, we include:
All piping, regardless of size
All piping accessories such as valves,
strainers, traps, etc.
All instruments and major instrument
piping
All safety items
All chutes and ducts
All electrical conduit for power
All lights and lighting conduit.
When about 95% of these items have
been resolved on the model a final model
review is held. At this review represen-
tatives from the engineering division,
research and development departments,
manufacturing and the production engi-
neering team go over the model "with
a fine tooth comb" to be sure that it is
the best that we know how to make it.
During this review, each pipe line is

and a complete check is made to be sure

flow diagram has been installed on the
model. In addition to this check for com-
pleteness each pipe, each valve and each
vessel is discussed in the logical flow
succession to be sure that the unit will
be safe, as easy as practicable to operate
and will produce the product it was
intended to produce at the lowest overall
total cost, taking into account the original
construction cost and the anticipated
maintenance problems. This careful re-
view by all concerned means a lower
overall cost, and also a better startup
with fewer problems once the facility is
constructed.
Usually quite a list of changes results
from all this contribution, and these are
happily incorporated for we feel that
these changes which would have to be
made in the construction stage or missed
entirely, causing increased cost and poor
operation. The last step in the modeling
procedure is the tagging and identifica-
tion of equipment, pipe lines, conduit,
and instruments for construction purposes
along with a color coding to aid the
field craftsmen.
Color coding and tagging are very im-
portant to the success of the model in
the field during construction and every
effort is made to make the model as
easily understood as possible. The pipes
are all coded according to construction
specification so that a quick glance will
tell a pipe fitter whether the line he is
installing is steel, copper, aluminum, or
some other material. Likewise, all elec-
trical conduit and associated equipment
is painted a special green and all instru-
ments and their connectors are painted

a special orange. The tagging is complete
with every instrument, pipe line number,
valve, etc. identified on the model.
As soon as the last tag is attached,
the color coding completed, and the
necessary photographs taken, the model
is shipped to the construction site. What
have we? A usable device for com-
munication that we made at less cost than
it would have cost to make the drawings
which would be required with a conven-
tional approach. There are large tangible
dollar savings by a reduction in pipe engi-
neering cost. In our experience this
amounts to a 40% reduction in the
piping engineering costs.
On an average million dollar job we
calculate this savings amounts to $20,000
in engineering costs alone. In addition,
there are the many intangible savings
which I have mentioned that chiefly in-
volve benefits derived from better visual-
ization.
Immediately upon reaching the con-
struction site, the construction forces can
use the model. There is no delay while
everyone gets familiar with his phase.
Instead, with all phases of work inte-
gated on the model, each one can get
underway. In general, these phases are
handled in the following manner:
In the case of Piping—freehand
sketches are made of each pipe line.
These sketches are completely dimen-
sioned, so that the pipe above 1" diam-
eter can be prefabricated in a shop and
thus obtain the lowest piping unit costs.
The dimensions are arrived at by scal-
ing the model with calipers and special
scales and by calculation where there are
items with close fixed relationships such
as a pump and a tank. Field fit-up
allowances are provided in the appro-
priate places just as would be done when
sketching from conventional drawings.
These allowances take care of errors in
scaling from the model and errors in
fabrication and erection of the equip-
ment. It is important to note that this
same sketching is required whether you
have convention drawings or models, and
working from a model is easier than from
drawings.
It is felt that having the model in
the field gives us many direct and in-
direct benefits. Some of the major ones
are:
a. A better visualization of the whole
job and thereby, a better overall
construction planning.
b. Elimination of all interference and
conflicts between phases because if
it will go together on the model it
will go together in the field.
c. Lower cost lump sum bids on the
various phases because the con-
tractors can more easily understand
what they are bidding on and also
how what they are bidding on fits
into the general scheme.
Taking these and other benefits into
consideration, it can be seen that the
use of models results in savings of time
and money, and cuts down on errors in
construction stemming from improper
visualization and interpretation of draw-
ings. However, it must be understood
that modeling is an extension of engi-
neering drawing. It is not a substitute.
Modeling cannot do everything that
drawing can do, but it can do many
things that drawing cannot. Used in con-
junction with advanced drawing tech-
niques, modeling can greatly speed inc
simplify the production of a wide range
of objects.

The ORGANIZATION and RETRIEVAL
of INFORMATION
The organization and retrieval of large volumes of
diverse types of information is rapidly becoming one
of today's more serious problems. Major areas where
the problem exists include business and industry, the
military, the government, and the scientific and engi-
neering community itself.
In its simpler forms, the problem may involve, for
example, the automatic handling and analysis of busi-
ness data such as payrolls, sales and manufacturing
figures, insurance premiums, and other essentially sta-
tistical data. At the other extreme are certain complex
military situations which require the concurrent inter-
pretation, analysis, and integration on a very short time
scale of data from a wide variety of sources, including
field reports, photographs, news reports, estimates of
industrial activity, and the like. In many of these situa-
tions, there is the additional requirement to translate
the information from a foreign language into English.
The development in recent years of electronic data
handling equipment is now making possible the
practical solution of many of these problems. Such
equipment has the capability to perform arithmetic
operations, make decisions among alternatives, store
and retrieve large quantities of information, and at
high speed automatically perform long, complex
sequences of operations.
At Ramo-Wooldridge, work is in progress on advanced
information handling systems that are characterized
by large volume and widely different forms of infor-
mation, short time scales, and a variety of uses and
users. The scope of the work includes the planning of
systems and procedures, programming various types of
data handling equipment, and formulation of require-
ments for new equipment. Research is also under way
on the machine translation of foreign languages into
English.
Engineers and scientists with experience in the follow-
ing fields are invited to explore the wide range of open-
ings now available:

. . . Boost Savings
As the recession drags on, savings from
better handling methods are becoming consid-
erably important. by PAUL BARTH, '58E
(The Technic takes great pleasure in
presenting the winning article in the
1937-58 Materials Handling Essay con-
test).
The Mueller Brass Company of Port
Huron, Michigan, began production
of non-ferrous alloys about five decades
ago on a small scale. As years passed, the
company grew to a moderate size. As
the plant grew, the old methods for han-
dling material proved inefficient. They
became obsolete because of the rapid
increase in production. The progressive
management of the company found the
existing material handling methods in-
sufficient, and it, therefore, sought out-
side counsel. Specialist were consulted,
and upon their advice, radical changes
were made in both the material handling
methods and the equipment being used.
As a result of these changes made, the
company has, during the past few years,
experienced phenomenal savings both in
time and money. These advantages have
appeared in unloading of raw material
and scrap, its transportation, temporary
storage of fabricated material, and in
Unloading of Materials
The material to be unloaded is of two
varieties: raw material and scrap. All
incoming material is usually transported
by railroad or by motor transport. The
railroad tracks are parallel to the plant
and approximately fifty feet from the
warehouse. The docks for the trucks arc
located on the opposite side of the ware-
house for rapid unloading. The new
material handling methods have not re-
quired any changes in the locations of
these tracks and docks.
Under the old method, cathode copper
billets were usually received by railroad
car. A car carried about 900 billets, each
of which weighed approximately 100
pounds. Three laborers using manual
methods unloaded the cars. AH copper
material was received unbundled in bil-
lets. The lead pigs and zinc slabs were
also received unbundled and unloaded by
hand. A tractor-and-trailer train manned
by two or more men transported these
materials to a storage area. This method
required five men approximately ten
hours to unload a car at an average of
$1.75 per man hour, or $52.50 to unload
one car. It cost an additional $3.50 for
indirect labor to transport billets, pigs,
and slabs to the storage area where they
were stored on the trailers. Hence, the
total indirect labor cost was $56 for
unloading each car. This method was
very costly. It required the use of ex-
pensive equipment: namely, a 2,000
tractor-and-trailer train. The cost was
amortized over a five-year period. All
depreciations and calculations are based
on a 360-day work year. The equipment
depreciation was then $1.31 for the ten
hours. The company used 10.5 carloads
each ten-hour period. The total cost,
therefore, of unloading this amount of
material was $589.31.
Under the new method, the vendor is
requested to bundle all the incoming raw
material. Slabs and pigs are palletized
and steel scrapping used to hold them in
place. Bundling the billets, makes pos-
sible the use of a fork truck, as is shown
in Figures 2 and 6. The fork trucks carry
each billet bundle to a temporary stor-
age area where it is placed on a
rack. The steel strapping, which made a
unit bundle of 30 billets, had already
been cut when the photograph was taken.
The weight of a bundle is approximately
3,000 pounds. The standard 4,000-pound
fork truck can, therefore, be used to
unload the freight cars and carry the
load to the storage area. Only two
laborers are necessary: one driver and one
to unload the fork truck.
A car can be unloaded with this new
method in two hours. The savings af-
fected in a year's operation was quite
beyond expectation. Using two men at
$1.75 per hour for two hours, the cost
is $7 per hour for direct labor for un-
loading the car. The depreciation of the
fork truck estimated at $2,000 is $1.11
per day if amortized for a five-year
period. The plant now uses approxi-
mately 100,000 pounds or 10.5 carloads
each eight-hour period in contrast to the
former ten-hour day. Indirect labor,
using the new material handling equip-
ment, is $7300 per eight-hour day.
The depreciation cost of $1.11 added to
the labor cost gives the total cost of
$74.61 for unloading the raw material
used in one day's operation. It will be
remembered that unloading the same
amount of raw material under the old
method cost $589.31. The total saving
is, therefore, $514.70 per day. The daily
amortized cost of the new racks is so
small that it need not be considered.
It should be noted that occasionally when
the factory is operating under peak pro-
duction, some billets are still transported
by the old trailer train.
Most vendors do not charge for the
extra service of bundling billets; how-
ever, if they did, the cost would be
negligible as compared with the over-all
savings. The advantage of handling
bundled billets is such that it would be-
hoove the company to patronize those
suppliers who are willing to perform this
service.

places manual labor in shoveling
info the wooden bins.
Scrap Handling
Under the old method of handling
scrap, the company used two men to
remove the material from the carrier.
These men using hand scoops shoveled
the material from the carrier to an end-
dump hopper on a fork truck. The truck
then transported the hopper load to the
storage bins which were constructed of
wood, each alloy occupying a special bin,
as shown in Figure 1. Two shovelers
were required to remove the scrap from
the end-dump hopper and pile it in ap-
propriate bins.
Under the old method, 15 hours were
required to unload the average motor
truckload of 3,200 pounds of scrap. It
cost the company 1.75 per man hour, or
$52.50 for the 15 hours required to
unload each truck. A freight car carried
approximately three times the amount of
a single truck. The daily indirect labor
cost for unloading a freight car of 9,600
pounds of loose scrap under the old
method was $157.50. The estimated cost
of an end-dump hopper and fork truck
is $2,000. If amortized over a five-year
period, the depreciation would be $1.11
daily or $2.09 for 15 hours. The daily
requirement of scrap was 100,000
pounds. The total indirect labor cost was
$1,653.75 for unloading 100,000 pounds.
The total cost, therefore, was $1,655.54,
assuming the old wooden bins had
already been amortized.
Under the new method, a mechanical
scoop is used to remove the scrap from
the railroad car or motor truck to an end-
dump hopper on a fork truck which
transports it to the storage area where
the scrap is then dumped into the hop-
per of a mechanical thrower unit, a
Stephens-Adamson or Payloader type.
This thrower, in turn, transports the
scrap to storage bins at a maximum rate
of 350,000 pounds per hour. The
thrower can be operated safely and easily
by one man. The mechanical thrower
and the mechanical scoop cost about
$6,500. If depreciated in five years, the
daily cost is $3.61 for an eight-hour
period.
Six new steel bins are used to receive
the scrap from the mechanical thrower.
These new bins cost approximately
$30,000. If amortized in twenty years,
the daily depreciation is $4.73. The
total amount of scrap handled in an
eight-hour day is approximately 100,000
pounds. The indirect labor cost of the
two men who operate the equipment,
under the new method, at the rate of
$1.75 per man hour is $28 for an eight-
hour day. The total daily cost of the
new method is $4.73 for the bins, $3.61
for depreciation of the equipment, and
Fig. 2—The fork truck used in conjunc-
tion with the end-dump hopper opens

$28 for indirect labor cost; thus, the
new method costs $36.34 for unloading
100,000 pounds of scrap compared with
$1,641.25 using the old method—a sav-
ing of $1,619-50. This amount seems
extremely high, but it is quite representa-
tive of saving that can be expected in any
factory of this type using comparable
material handling equipment.
Material Transportation
A considerable part of the cost of
operating the plant results from trans-
porting materials to and from the plant.
It will be recalled that raw material,
under the old method, was stored on
trailer trains until needed. With the
new method, raw material is stored on
racks and pallets. The cost difference in
transporting the raw material, under the
two methods, from the storage area to
the furnace is of limited significance and
will not be considered here. Very con-
siderable savings do result, however,
from the new material handling methods
used in transporting scrap to the furnace,
and also from transporting the melt to
fabrication areas.
Before the Mueller Brass Company was
modernized, scrap was transported from
temporary storage to the furnace areas
by means of a 4,000-pound fork truck
and an end-dump hopper. The end-
dump hopper was filled with scrap by a
mechanical scoop, as shown in Figure 1.
The scrap in the end-dump hopper was
then transported to the furnace where it
was dumped in the charging area. The
furnace operator then shoveled the mate-
rial into the furnace. This method re-
quired the services of four men. One
man used to shovel the material into the
furnace, one operated the mechanical
scoop, a third laborer drove the fork
truck, and a fourth served as a helper.
These workers were paid $1.75 per hour
with the exception of the furnace oper-

total indirect cost was $58 per eight-hour
day. The 52,000 fork truck and the end-
dump hopper amortized over a five-year
perior gives a depreciation of $1.11 per
day. The cost of the mechanical scoop
was $4,500. Using the same amortiza-
tion plan, the depreciation was $2.55 per
day. The total cost of transporting a
day's supply of scrap, 100,000 pounds,
was, therefore, $61.66.
At the present time, the scrap is trans-
ported from the temporary storage area
to the furnaces entirely by mechanical
means. A fork truck equipped with an
end-dump hopper carries loads of scrap
from the newly constructed storage bins
to the furnace area. As shown in Figure
2, the hopper on the fork truck opens
the hinged gate at the base of the stor-
age bins and receives its load by gravity.
When the end-dump hopper is filled and
the fork truck backs away, the storage
bin gate automatically doses. At the fur-
nace area, the end-dump hopper unloads
the scrap into a skip hoist which elevates
it to the furnace level. The scrap is then
dumped on a belt-type conveyor which
charges it into the furnace.
The skip hoist and small, powered,
belt-type conveyor each cost approxi-
mately $1,000. The estimated cost of the
fork truck is $2,000 including the end-
dump hopper. One man is required at
$1.75 per hour to drive the fork truck
and another at $2 per hour to operate
the skip hoist, the charging conveyor, and
the furnace. The total indirect cost is
$30 per eight-hour day. This material
handling equipment serves three existing
furnaces. The fork truck amortized over
a period of five years costs $1.11 per day.
The skip hoist and conveyor amortized
for the same period also costs $1.11 per
day. The six bins, each of which cost
$5,000, are to be amortized over a
twenty-year period. The depreciation is
$4.73 per day. The total cost, there-

fore, of this method is $36.95 per eight-
hour day. As stated above, the cost,
under the old method, is $61.66 for
transporting a day's requirement of scrap
or a net saving of $24.71 per day.
From the Furnace Area to Fabrication
The melt must be transported from the
furnace area to fabrication points. The
fluid melt is cast and cut into billets
which are, in turn, extruded into rods
or sold. This work is done in a rod mill.
Under the old method, the trailer
train was drawn by an industrial tractor
to the various department areas where
the requirement of each department was
unloaded manually. This method of
transporting and unloading required five
men at approximately $1.75 per man
hour for one shift. The indirect labor
cost of the old method was $75 per shift
or $210 for a three-shift day of 24
hours. The cost per day of using the
tractor-trailer train, estimated worth
$2,000, was $1.11 for an eight-hour day
if amortized for a five-year period or
$3.33 for 24-hour day. The total cost
of transporting the rod for a 24-hour
period was $213.33.
Under the new method, bar stock is
bundled into 1,000-pound lots to facili-
tate transportation by the Cleveland Tram
Rail System, which is an overhead hoist-

mum space with maximum availability.
Fig. A—The new style racks separate
stock sizes and types.
rail combination. This method makes
possible the individual supplying of tar
stock to each department. All bar stock
made in excess of the department's daily
needs is sold or placed in a storage area
It will be remembered that under the old
method bar stock was distributed by a
tractor-trailer train which unloaded mate-
rials at each department as it went by.
It required the services of fifteen men
for a 24-hour period. The new method
requires only four men for the same
period of time. Their average rate of
pay is $1.75 per hour. The average cost,
using four men for three shifts, is $18.6-4
per shift, or $55.92 for indirect labor for
a 24-hour day. The estimated cost of the
Cleveland Tram Rail System is $18,000.
It is amortized for a period of fifteen
years of eight-hour days, or five years ot
24-hour days. The depreciation is then
$3.33 for each 24-hour period. The esti-
mated cost of bundling is $10 per day.
The cost of this method is $69.25 for a
24-hour day. Under the old method, the
cost was $213.33 for handling the same
amount of material or a saving ot
$144.08 per day.
Under the old method, excess bar
stock was stored quite at random in i
designated storage area, as shown in
Figure 3. Straps on the bundled mate-
rial were generally cut after arrival to
permit the withdrawal of any needed
pieces. The remaining unbundled bars
often became mixed with other bars. As
a result, large quantities of bar stock had
to be handled many times by hand. This
method of handling the stock require
two men, each driving a fork truck. The
rate of pay for the workers was Sl"s
per hour or $28 per eight-hour day. The
cost of the two for trucks was $4,000
or $2.22 per eight-hour day if amortized
in five years. The total cost, therefore,
was $28.

PROGRESS
Compiled by MIKE MALINOWSKI, '61E
The parade of progress continues to
promenade by month after month. This
month we find another weapon for the
battle of the traffic war. A report of a
safer method of parachuting from high
altitudes, another step in the moon race,
has just been released. Besides these in-
novations the U.S. is now the proud pos-
sessor of a timepiece which can measure
events around the world to a thousandth
of a second. Also, construction on a new
type of building, one without internal
supports, has been begun. These are the
major scientific offsprings of this month.
New Economical Dome
Structure
An all-steel "Union Dome" — the
world's largest circular building without
internal supports — is under construction
in Baton Rouge, La., by Union Tank Car
Company of Chicago.
Announcement of the 10-story high,
geodesic structure was made by company
President E. A. Locke, Jr.
The new building is believed to be
the first major industrial use of a dome
structure in this country. It will house
regional maintenance and tank car repair
facilities.
Dimensions of the "Union Dome" are
375 feet across its interior base—greater
than the length of a football field—and
116 feet high at the center. Total floor
area enclosed by the dome is 110,000
square feet. It is a clear-span dome, con-
taining no internal supports whatsoever.
It is also the first geodesic dome to be
made entirely of steel.
Artist's rendering of the all-steel "Union Dome"—the world's largest circular
building without internal supports. The 10-story high geodesic structure is 375 feet
across its interior base and 116 feet high at its center.
Several major advantages of a clear-
span structure such as the "Union Dome"
for industrial use were outlined by
Locke. These include economy in the
cost per square foot of area covered,
visual control of all working areas from
one central point, and unimpeded mate-
rials and work flow.
The dome and the facilities which it
will house will cost in excess of S 1,000,-
000, but significantly less than the con-
ventional car repair plant of this size,
according to Locke.
The "Union Dome" will consist solely
of 320 steel panels fabricated in 12 basic
sizes and welded together. The panels
were specially fabricated, from standard
1/g inch steel sheet and 4 inch tubing,
on location at Baton Rouge.
A tunnel-shaped paint building made
of similar steel panels connects with the
main circular repair shop area. The
paint building is 200 feet long and 20
feet high.
The entire project is scheduled for
completition in mid 1958.
World Clock Measures
Thousandths of a Second
A "world time clock" which measures
the exact moment of any event, anywhere
on earth, to the nearest thousandth of i
second, was described here today bv
Edgerton, Germeshausen &amp; Grier, Inc.
who developed it primarily for use in
testing nuclear devices.
32
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


for designing and operating equipment
that times, controls and detonates nuclear
devices during test operations carried out
by the Atomic Energy Commission. The
clock was developed to help determine
the exact time of nuclear detonations,
but EG&amp;C men have foreseen many other
useful applications for it. Ernest F. Wil-
son, development engineer, explained:
"Suppose that a thormonuclear device
is to be fired at Eniwetok. At another
location, perhaps a thousand miles away,
we have an associate who is to record
some scientific data related to the ex-
plosion. If he is to relate his data accu-
rately to the event, he must know
exactly—to within a tiny fraction of a
second—the moment when the detona-
tion begins. This world time clock will
tell him."
Time signals are taken from WWV,
the radio station operated by the U. S.
Bureau of Standards. These signals are
extremely accurate at their point of
origin, but in traveling great distances
around the earth, they develop inherent
errors due to many variables: the speed
of radio waves, atmospheric conditons
which vary that speed, the so-called
"bounce" or reflection between earth and
sky and certain other conditions. The
world time clock may be set so as to
compensate for these variations and ob-
tain an "approximate" time, correct to
within a few hundredths of a second.
Then comes the task of setting the time
exactly, to a split-second.
"This is done," went on Wilson, "by
means of a differential gear and precision
gear train, used in conjunction with a
stroboscopic device. The dial has the
usual hour hand, minute hand and
sweep second hand; but in addition it
has a hand that registers tenths of a
second and a mili-second hand. This
latter hand records thousandths of a
second, by virtue of rotation at a speed
of 10 revolutions per second around a
dial divided into one hundred parts.
"Obviously, no human being could
possibly follow such a motion with the
eye. For that reason, we have a strobo-
scope which creates the familiar optical
iilusion of making moving objects appear
to stand still. This is a special strobe,
however. By means of special circuitry,
its pulse which is at one-second intervals
can be changed so as to be brought into
coincidence with the time-ticks from
WWV in such a manner that the instru-
ment can be set precisely. Thereafter it
acts simply as a super-accurate stopwatch
in timing phenomena."
While it may seem incomprehensible
to the layman that any event need be
timed to such precise standards, the
company stated that its engineers are
working on versions of the clock which
will be able to record in the microsecond
range . . . millionths of a second . . .
"because there is an actual need for a
world time clock which will offer this
order of accuracy. The major problem
that remains is the rapid and accurate
setting of the clock to world time to
microsecond accuracy. This is approach-
ing solution in the study of very low fre-
quency radio propagation."
Safety Parachuting System
from High Altitudes
A New York Engineer today described
to aviation experts a new system for
parachuting a man back to earth from
extreme altitudes without exposing him
to perilous hazards. The device, which
consists of a closed capsule and a system
of parachutes is designed to be ejected
A timekeeper of fantastic accuracy is
this "world time clock" developed by
Edgerton, Germeshausen &amp; Grier, Inc.
from high flying supersonic aircraft. It
overcomes many of the same problems
that might be faced by a returning space
traveler.
C. W. Russell, assistant project engi-
neer at the Republic Aviation Corpora-
tion, Farmingdale, New York, a speaker
at the Aviation Conference of The
American Society of Mechanical Engi-
neers and the American Rocket Society,
outlined the difficulties facing designers
who try to get a planeless pilot safelessly
and painlessly back to earth. He pointed
out that engineers must provide compli-
cated ejection units that will not subject
the pilot to unbearable acceleration or
deceleration. Several types of capsules
are under consideration, including those
that consist of the entire pressurized
cockpit, the whole front end of the plane,
a minimum-size seat capsule and a com-
promise version which houses pilot, seat
and some control instruments.
One engineering problem, according to
Mr. Russell's paper is providing enough
structural strength to prevent the cap-
sule from being torn apart during sud-
den stops or sudden spurts of accelera-
tion. At high speeds a pilot and his
equipment may be subjected to forces
many times the force of gravity. Pulling
out of a dive, for example, a pilot's
"weight" may increase to ten times nor-
mal; that is, he is subjected to ten times
the force of gravity.
In his paper, Mr. Russell described a
specific capsule unit now being tested.
In this capsule the pilot who wishes to
bail out traveling above the speed of
sound many miles over the earth presses
an ejection handle. A complicated series
of devices then locks his shoulder har-
ness into place and closes a sliding door
to seal his capsule. This maintains the
air pressure. The capsule is then blown
down a set of rails and out the bottom
of the plane by two explosive charges.
Machinery is set in motion to extend fins
from the capsule to steady it during its
fall. Finally, a series of parachutes are
released which, together with shock-
absorbing equipment, gradually slows the
descent of the capsule so that it floats
to the ground.
After describing the numerous prob-
lems faced by engineers who designed
this unit, Mr. Russell concluded, "Again
it must be emphasized that there is no
margin for error in the mechanisms
utilized in this or any escape device. It
may be called on to operate only once,
but the report on how well it worked
should be given by the pilot who has had
to use it."

A PROFESSION
Professor Clay Porter describes the efforts
of Engineers for the establishment of a profes-
sional organization. by Professor R. C. PORTER
As engineers, how well do we fir into
the order of professional men?
How well are our ranks defined? How
well does society accept us as a pro-
fession? These are some of the questions
which demand as serious conideration as
do our technical matters if we are to
merit and receive the high public esteem
to which we aspire.
Many years ago the medical profession
became "of age." Setting forth desired
standards of competence and perform-
ance, and sharply defining its scope of
activity, it urged and obtained the pass-
age of appropriate laws to protect the
public against non-professional practices,
and to protect the profession against un-
qualified intruders. To this legal restraint
the medical doctors added their profes-
sional organization (The American Medi-
cal Association) with its code of ethics
and other standards of membership, to
arrive at the dignified and respected posi-
tion which the medical profession occu-
pies today.
Likewise, over the years, the lawyers
have established laws to define the pro-
fessional practice of law and to regulate
the qualifications of individuals who
would engage in such practice. Also,
they have perfected their professional
organization (The American Bar Asso-
ciation) and instituted their professional
standards such that today the legal pro-
fession is universally recognized. No
thoughtful person would offer himself
for the practice of law today without
first complying with all of the require-
ments of the profession. The legal pro-
fession is firmly established and fully
accepted by society.
Dentistry, in more recent years, has
followed the pattern set forth by medi-
cine and law, and has, within the mem-
ory of many persons now living, risen
to the full height of a stately profession.
Its aceptance by society is now unques-
tioned.
In addition to these over-all profes-
sional organizations, which are non-
technical in character, the previously
mentioned societies support technical
sub-sections, or specialty organizations for
the purpose of exchanging technical in-
formation, sponsoring research, and per-
forming other functions acording to the
interests of their several specialty groups.
For instance, The American Academy of
Dermatology, and The American Acad-
emy of Obstetrics are specialty groups of
the medical profession. Likewise, The
American Bar Association maintains sub-
sections in Criminal Law, Patent Law,
and many other specialties. The Den-
tists are similarly organized into their
specialty groups. None of the specialty
groups attempts to represent the whole
profession to the public. Their functions
are limited within their professional
ranks. The spokesmen for the profession
as a whole is the over-all professional
organization. Thus when Congressman
Jones wants to know whether the medi-
cal doctors will approve the law which he
is formulating, he goes to the A.M A
and gets his answer from the profession
at once.
Unlike the previously mentioned pro-
fessions, engineering did not have in
over-all professional organization from
the start. It seemed to grow up in re-
verse. Its technical specialty organiza-
tions came into existence first and some
grew to have great strength as inde-
pendent units, but they had no central
organization to which all of their mem-
bers belonged and which therefore could
represent the engineering profession is
a whole. It had no equivalent of the

be investing during the next twelve-
months. Then, dividing this sum into
three or four packages, he should peri-
odically invest this during the course
of the year. Then over a period of years,
he will have bought as many stocks at
low prices as at high prices. It is felt
that ten years is the best period of time
for dollar averaging to be effective. In
shorter periods, there might not be the
correct proportions of high and low
prices, but of course, a longer period will
not be detrimental.
Now that we have looked over the
various plans of investment, we might
begin to wonder how to pick a stock.
Of the hundreds of issues on the New
York Stock Exchange, which will return
the best dividends, which will keep their
original value, and which will follow
the cost of living index most rapidly?
One way of avoiding this dilemma is
to invest in an investment company.
These companies buy a large number of
stocks and manage them with the aid of
experts. The individual buys a share in
these companies and as the total value
of the investment company's holdings
fluctuates so does the value of his stock.
This type of arrangement has two main
advantages. In the first place, there is
not the headache and worry that accom-
panies the comparatively amateurish
methods of the average person. The in-
vestment company managers are continu-
ously reviewing their stockholdings and
can make all necessary decisions backed
by their long experience. Secondly, the
price tends to be fairly stable. Although
one of the companies may take a finan-
cial tumble or even go bankrupt, the
average value of all the holdings will
only be affected slightly. This latter
reason makes investment companies a
good bet for dollar averaging. The stable
price tends to make the system more
effective and a watchful eye does not
have to be kept on the financial pages
of the daily newspaper.
Suppose, though, that one wants to run
his own financial affairs and wants to
decide for himself which stocks to buy.
Then the best way to get information
about soundness of a business is not
through hearsay or the word of a quick
salesman, but is from the annual reports.
Suggestions for reading this valuable aid
to the stockholder will, therefore, be in
order.
Stuart Chase, in a widely quoted
article,* notes some important questions
which should be answered in reading an
annual report. In the first place, the
whole question of the company's size
should be answered. This information,
valuable in determining whether the
company is a "blue chip" outfit or not,
is shown in three places in most reports.
Size is best indicated by the "total
assets" figure. Comparison between vari-
ous companies on this phase gives the
best idea of a company's extent.
Size can also be seen through the
employment totals, which have been

given increasingly more often in recent
years. In addition, a note on labor policy
is included. The company's attitude to-
ward the worker is important since the
earnings and thus the dividends will
decrease during lengthy strikes.
Although care must be used in inter-
preting the figures, total sales or revenues
also give an indication of the firm's size.
Comparison with the year before is essen-
tial since a high figure which is lower
than last year's is a danger sign. Infla-
tion can also distort this figure and
therefore it is vital to compare, say,
barrels of oil or cars sold with dollar
sales in two succesive years. If sales
quantity is down, but dollar sales are up.
prices, and not necessarily the company's
worth are increasing.
Location of plant and resources is im-
portant, too. If the plant is located in
a foreign country, one apt to be struck
by war, the stockholder must be wan'.
A worthy company may go bankrupt if a
local conflict causes it to desert its

sidered. Although materials may have
been abundant for the past few years,
the possibility of a shortage will make
the stock a bad risk. Management should
include some statement regarding supply
in their annual report.
The final big question to be considered
concerns the company's financial situ-
ation. Earnings, dividends, and assets

question if examined carefully. Earnings

views. But it should be remembered
that both labor and management are large
and powerful forces in the state. For this
reason the administration should be a
third powerful influence situated in the
middle, aiding and helping both sides as
much as possible.
As much as we dislike to admit it, this
ideal situation does not exist in Michigan.
In the words of the Free Press again,
"Unfortunately, Gov. William's public
attitude is that management is always
evil, and that when it mentions taxes,
costs, and competition it is trying to
bamboozle Michigan into a free ride."
If this conception of a labor-run state
could be destroyed and there were indi-
cations from the government that they
were concerned about the problems of in-
dustry, we'd be a long way towards solv-
ing the problem of Michigan's industrial
future.
It should be noted that there is sort
of progress being made concerning the
latter point. Recently Williams said "he
is seriously thinking of turning his per-
sonal charm and powers of persuasion
on out-of-state industrialists in an at-
tempt to get them to locate new plants
in Michigan. At least it's a start!"
Other States Solve Problem
So far we have explored what is hap-
pening to Michigan industry (i.e. its
growth has come to a virtual standstill),
why this is happening (i.e. high taxes
mainly) and now there remains the ques-
tion, "What can we do to reverse this
trend?" Before answering this question,
it might prove helpful to study two
other states to see what they have done
to keep their industry growing at the
rate of near one plant a week.
We will discover one state, Indiana,
has solved its industrial tax problem by
simply placing the burden on the people.
Ohio, on the other hand, has developed
a very successful system that has not
overburdened either side, business or the
consumer.
Looking first at Indiana we see that
the only tax on business is a %% levy
on goods sold within the state. This
accounted for only 2.8% of the 872
million dolar budget. This should be
compared to the 12% of a 858 million
budget in Michigan. Republican Gov-
ernor Harold W. Hanley happily attri-
butes the fact that Indiana is attracting
one new plant a week to such a low tax
rate.
This all seems fine until we discover
that Indiana's basic policy is to place the
cost of the government on the individual.
They argue that in this way taxes are
kept close to the people and they can
best understand what the government is
costing them.
To carry out this policy Indiana has
a 4.5% tax on gross receipts (wages,
fees, bonuses). Hoosiers must also pay
a personal property tax that is now eight
cents per 100 dollars of valuation.
Turning now to Ohio we discover that
they too are attracting new industries
very rapidly. Republican Governor C.
William O'Neill happily points out that
Ohio is now second only to New York
in manufacturing and asserts that his
state will take over first place within the
next ten years.
As O'Neill continues we note quite a
contrast between his views and those of
Gov. Williams. O'Neill says, "We feel
that the life blood of any state is indus-
try which creates jobs which in turn
creates wealth and the money needed to
operate efficiently. We like industry and
we want industry to like us."

Soot Solved This Problem
One thing Richard (Rick) MacDonnell could say for
flight test instrumentation — it had variety. Here he
was, in line of duty, hunting a coal oil lamp on the
Mojave Desert.
Looking back, Rick saw that the whole Crusader
instrumentation program had been a series of shift-
ing scenes. He'd started by talking to different
specialists, finding out the kinds of flight information
they wanted. He learned a lot about heats, loads,
amplitudes and flutter. These were the things Rick's
instrumentation would have to detect.
Designing and building the system took him in
another direction. There was the airborne equip-
ment — up to 12 miles of wiring and 600 pounds of
black boxes for a single demonstration aircraft. Each
sub-system was environment-tested, breadboarded,
checked out and packaged to fit key corners of the
Crusader structure.
Taking shape at the same time was a mobile ground
station — another project with which Rick was asso-
ciated. It brought flight test telemetering and data
processing closer to automation than they'd ever
been before. At Vought's Mojave Desert test base,
Rick's equipment clicked. It speeded preparation for
the Crusader's dramatic operational debut —
the Thompson Trophy-winning speed run.
There was just one hitch — a National Aeronautical
Association rule which would limit altitude deviation
to 328 feet during the Trophy dash. A Bureau of
Standards barograph would ride with the pilot, its
stylus etching out exact altitude on a smoked cylin-
der. Fair enough — but Vought's desert crew didn't
have a workable way to blacken duplicate cylinders
for practice. And precise warm-up flights were
essential.
That's why Rick went hunting for a coal oil lamp.
He found one in the store of a desert outfitter. Back
on the base, the lamp was lighted and the wick
turned up. It "sooted" the purpose perfectly.
Instrumentation means development adventure
and variety at Chance Vought. Here, engineers of all
specialties use initiative and self-expression to
contribute to some of the most advanced
instrumentation techniques in the industry.

by KEN DEC, '61E
25 Years Ago
In accordance with this month's Tech-
nic theme of economics in engineer-
ing, we are reprinting an article which
appeared in another Technic twenty-five
years ago. First published in the Febru-
ary, 1933 issue, H. S. Pearson's "Engi-
neering and New Economies'' deals with
the difficulties of integrating a sense of
economics into the engineer's work.
While reading the article, it is surprising
to find that many of these problems
which faced engineers a generation ago
continue to trouble them today. Then,
as now, engineers must plan their work
in a way which strengthens the economic
status of the nation. Although many
changes have been made since the article
was written, the basic problems have
remained the same.
"We frequently hear it charged that
the engineers are responsible for over-
mechanization, obsolescence, unemploy-
ment and other phases of our industrial
problem. There is only a modicum of
truth in such a statement. Engineering
is scientific and impersonal. It adds to
the store of human knowledge and to
its available instruments of production,
but it does not compel industry to use
them unwisely. The responsibility for
unwise use rests squarely upon the pro-
moters, owners and managers in industry.
However, the engineer as consultant and
as manager must share this responsibility
to some degree, for as designer, estimator
and frequently as actual manager he is in
a position to advise owners and man-
agers concerning the wisdom and econ-
omy of use in particular instances. He
is too much inclined to focus his atten-
tion on short-time engineering-economic
aspects of a project such as a reduction
of unit cost by the substitution of a
machine for human labor, without ade-
quate regard for the social-economic
factors of competition, prices, purchas-
ing power, variable demand, obsoles-
cence, trends in industry and in general
the total economy of use.
"A few engineers have risen above
these limitations and are winning status
as economists as well as engineers. Re-
cently the author heard a social scientist
declare in public that the engineers are
now our best economists. This acclaim
is as far from the real fact as is the
accusation noted above. The ratio of
engineers who are making themselves
also progressive-thinking economists to
the total number of engineers is less
than the ratio to the total number of
economists of those who have broken
through the intellectual limitations im-
posed by classical traditions. The fact
is that a new group of students and
leaders is coming into being; a group
composed on the one hand of engineers
who are acquiring the social-economic
point of view and are exploring the body
of knowledge given by economics, and
on the other hand, of economists who
are becoming aware of the significance of
the engineering technique and are ex-
ploring the body of knowledge built up
by engineering. Both elements of this
new group have realized that while one
may specialize his activity at any par-
ticular moment, he can no longer spe-
cialize the governing point of view or
body of information with which all tasks
are approached.
"Engineering is creating a new world,
a world of surplus economy which is not
manageable through the principles and
technique of an older, deficit economy.
Our present industrial problem is an ex-
pression of this incompatibility. It is not
merely a phenomenon of cyclic depres-
sion but apparently also one of severe
break in the secular trend. That is why
the depression has lasted so long and
will probably continue to last for a con-
siderable number of years.
"Several new forces in our national
development have come to focus during
the past decade and the resultant com-
bined force has caused what we call a
break in the secular trend.
"The first of these new forces relates
to population. The closure of our doors
to immigration has made significant the
fact that we have for some time been
experience a declining rate of increase
of population, and are confronted by the
prospect of a stationary or declining pop-
ulation which may be realized during the
lives of the younger readers of this
article. At the same time the production
of social income is increasing at a rapid
rate. This requires enormous readjust-
ments in order to maintain the circular
flow of production-consumption forces;
equalization in the domestic distribution
of social income, or rapid development
of foreign markets, or radical restriction
in agricultural and industrial production,
or some composite of these.
"The second of these new forces re-
lates to international finance and com-
merce. We have been a debtor nation;
recently fate has been apparently unkind
enough to make us a creditor nation. If
we elect to remain a creditor nation what
has been called a favorable balance of
trade will become unfavorable, and whit
has been called an unfavorable balance of
trade will become favorable. To make-
necessary readjustments will be a shock
to our business structure as now organ-
ized. If we elect (and are able) not to
be a creditor nation and therefore put
obstacles in the way of the loan of sur-
plus capital abroad, then we shall have
turned its investment in upon our do-
mestic market, with a productivity which
they cannot carry under present condi-
tions. Or we may devise some way not
now formulated of directing this invest-
ment upon the market in such a manner
that it will not clog the channels of dis-
tribution—but that will require a polio
and procedure which will be revolu-
tionary.
"The third of these new forces is the
most perplexing of all and is the major
cause of dislocation of the secular trend
We have within fifteen years added *

so enlarged the means of utilizing Ni-

trades old standards of measurement of
the relations of the individual to pro-
ductivity have become obsolete. We still
distribute social income among those
low-income classes which purchase more
than three-fourths of consumer goods
and services on the assumption that each
should receive in proportion to what his
productivity was before the day of high-
powered equipment, while the actual
productivity of the high-powered equip-
ment which he now tends multiplies
many times his productivity under earlier
conditons. The consequence is an in-
creasingly uneven distribution of social
income and savings; investment in pro-
duction equipment more rapidly than ef-
fective purchasing power is built up;
unemployment; obsolescence; a creaking
and grinding of the commercial and in-
dustrial mechanism; and periodically a
complete breakdown with consequent dis-
tress and misery and psychiatric disturb-
ances of the collective mind.
'And there are other problems of a
secondary nature. Many of the accus-
tomed mechanisms of commerce and in-
dustry are functioning badly under mod-
ern conditions of production and distribu-
tion, and complicate the dislocation
caused by the major forces. Our currency,
banking system and control of credit are
no longer adequate; even our concept of
private property, which from one point
of view is a social mechanism, requires
revision and re-definition to fit the
present stage of industrial evolution.
"These major and minor problems are
all parts of a great composite problem;
and together they constitute a challenge
for the wisest and boldest and most ener-
getic leadership to a solution as compre-
hensive as is the range of these related
elements of the problem.
"This leadership must be of a new
order and engineers must be ready to play
their part in it. However, not as engi-
neers of the conventional type any more
than the economists who play theit part
can be economists of the conventional
type. Each must break through the walls
of the compartment into which too nar-
row specialization has shut him and be-
come a composite engineer-economist—
in fact a composite engineer-economist-
statesman. This new leader must be cre-
ated, not by cementing together the frag-
ments of a training which has been first
that of engineer and later that of econo-
mist, or vice versa, but by a training
which has been from the beginning an
integration of training in both engineer-
ing and economics. But this raises the
question of the organization of curricula,
consideration of which is not a major
purpose of this article.
"The present generation of young men
coming out of our engineering schools
and schools of economics or business
administration must therefore make for
itself as best it can an integration of
engineering and economics. The writer
when at the university specialized in
economics. He had the good fortune at
that time to live several years with a stu-
dent of enginering and by reason of that
contact to frequent the halls of the school
of engineering. Later, by accident, some
twenty years of his life have been spent
in association with engineers and in the
environment of engineering problems.
This combination has given him a vision
of what the engineer-economist of the
future can be when as student the young
engineer explores the fields of economics
as assiduously and consistently as he docs
that of engineering—deliberately and
purposefully, and not by accident as has
the writer. That generation will furnish
us real leaders to meet the developing
industrial problem, which is a problem
calling for knowledge of engineering,
economics and politics."
50 Years Ago
In the February, 1908 issue of the
"Technic," an article appeared describing
the methods used to take rock samples
where the new "Soo" canal was to be
built. The samples were needed to de-
termine the composition of the rock
through which the canal was to pass.
The portion of the original article, re-
printed here, describe the basic drilling
operations used to obtain the samples.
"Chilled steel shot was used for this
work, and they are made to travel under
a hollow soft steel bit which rotates
and exerts a pressure on the shot at the
same time, thereby causing them to cut
away the rock. The bit is usually from
three to ten inches long and is screwed
into the core barrel—a hollow cylinder
of the same diameter as the bit, and on
this particular job, from 2 to 4)/ feet
long.
"The core-barrel was in turn screwed
on to the drill rods, which were much
smaller in diameter and in lengths of
2, 5 and 10 feet. Water was fed into the
dril rods by means of a water swivel and
lifter, fastened to the top of the driving
rod, to which was attached the drill rods.
By means of a stop cock in the swivel,
the shot was fed into the drill from the
top and was carried down to the bit by
the water. On the inside of the bit were
two grooves placed diametrically opposite
each other to allow the shot to run down
under the bit easily. One side of the bit
was cut away in a V-shaped manner to
allow the shot to work freely under the
bit. Besides the shot bit the outfit con-
sists of a Davis cutter for cutting ordi-
nary earth and sand, a clay bit, and a
chopping bit. The power, provided by
a small vertical engine, is transmitted by
means of a belt to the bevel-gears for
rotating the drill rods.
"The shot drill is very well adapted
for general work, but there are many
difficulties encountered by shot drillers—
the chief ones are as follows:
1. The regulation of the amount of
shot necessary to cut the rock of varying
hardness.
2. The regulation of the amount of
water necessary to remove the washings
without disturbing the shot.
3. The pressure to be exerted upon the
shot to obtain the best results.
4. The removal of core, as a small
piece left in the hole is liable to turn
over in the bit and cause trouble and a
waste of time.
"The underlying rock at the "Soo" is
red Potsdam sandstone and at the new
lock site the ledge is from nine to
thirty-five feet below the surface of the
ground.
"The ledge is not at all regular, and
on account of the strata dipping slightly
toward the east, the surface has a sort
of scalloped formation. Immediately
above the rock ledge there is, in many
places, a layer of hard-pan, from four
to six feet deep, composed of clay, sand,
pebbles consisting of broken sandstone,
clay, and sand, which makes a very diffi-
cult and unsatisfactory material to drill
through.
"In order to sink the casing, a shallow
hole was first dug and then a solid steel
shaft 5" in diameter was driven into the
earth by means of a 1500-pound pile
driver hammer. This shaft was driven
into the ground as far as possible, some-
times to the rock ledge itself, and then
was removed by means of jacks. The
casing was then inserted in the hole made
by the shaft and driven down as far as
was possible without injuring the bot-
tom of it. After this operation was com-
pleted the pile driver was removed and
the drill set in position. By alternately
drilling, washing out, and driving the
casing, it was finally gotten down to the
rock ledge and everything was in readi-
ness for the shot drill to begin opera-
tions."

of the physicist
This invention by a University professor may
soon replace the cloud chamber in the study of
subatomic particles.
by MAX LEGATSKI, '61E
Scientific experimentation may be said
to consist of three elements—the
observer, the observed matter, and the
means of observation. In elementary
chemistry or physics, the method of ob-
servation, or the means of communica-
tion between the observed and the ob-
server, may be as simple as a stroboscopic
camera, a thermometer, or a pressure
gauge, but as we explore the more com-
plex sciences we find that this type of
"communication" is also far more com-
plex.
Since the major problem of the atomic
physicist is to determine the properties
of particles too small to be observed
directly, the next best approach is to
study the effects of these particles upon
other particles which can be observed.
Prior to the invention of the bubble
chamber by University of Michigan
physicist Donald A. Glaser, this was done
by either of two devices, a cloud chamber
or a photographic emulsion, both of
which depend on the fact that as certain
particles fly through a substance, they
leave behind them a wake of ionized
atoms.
The Wilson cloud chamber consists of
a container of gas which is supersaturated
with vapor. As a particle flics through
the container, drops of liquid condense
around the ions along its trail and along
the path of any nuclei with which the
particle collides, producing visible paths.
A photographic emulsion, when ex-
posed to a beam of particles, and devel-
oped, shows the ionized path of each
particle as a black line.
Both of these devices, however, have
serious drawbacks. In the cloud chamber,
the low density of the vapor medium
provides little opportunity for particles
to produce an interesting collision, and
the emulsion is so dense that it is literally
filled with tracks, making it extremely
difficult to sort out those of interest.
Also, the detction of tracks in an emul-
sion is possible only with a powerful
microcope, and a cloud chamber often
tends to distort the tracks because of con-
vection currents. All of these disadvan-
tages are eliminated in the bubble cham-
ber.
What is the Bubble Chamber?
The bubble chamber consists of a pres-
sure tight vessel containing a super-
heated liquid under pressure. When the
pressure is suddenly reduced by special
expansion devices, the liquid becomes
superheated far above its boiling point,
although boilng will not begin for a few
milliseconds. Thus, a beam of atomic par-
ticles entering the chamber leaves charged
ions in its wake around which boiling
may begin. This string of bubbles, when
photographed with high speed strobo-
scopic camera systems, produces a perma-
nent record of the decaying particles, as
well as the collisions among the particles.
The phenomena of "bumping," or
eruptive boiling of a superheated liquid,
may be demonstrated quite simply in the
laboratory by heating clean water in a
smooth class test tube. At first it gets
hotter and hotter without visible boiling,
until it suddenly erupts with a violent
evolution of vapor. All liquids may be

"Since the day we decided to get married, I've been
doing a lot of thinking about our future. It's time I
made a choice on a career. I've talked to the Dean of
Engineering, most of my professors, and to some of the
fellows who have graduated, and you know, they all
said the same thing.
"They all agree that the aircraft and missile industry
holds the best opportunities and the brightest future for
an engineer these days. What they said makes sense,
too, because developments in this field today really give
a fellow an opportunity to make important contribu
tions on vital projects.
"Not only that, but the aircraft industry is noted for
its good salaries. Generous benefits, too. And advance-
ment in both salary and position is limited only by flow
far I want to go."
Unlimited opportunities, high salaries, company-paid
benefits unheard of until a few years ago — these
are only a few of the reasons why so many young engi-
neers with a keen eye to the future are choosing the
aircraft industry.
It is only natural that many engineering graduates
should consider joining Northrop Aircraft, Inc., be
cause the company shares its many successes with every
member of its engineering and scientific team. Ad-
vanced projects at Northrop are now in production, and
active top-priority projects mean rapid advancement
and success for the individual engineer.
Such projects include the famous Snark SM-62,
world's first intercontinental guided missile, now being
activated in the first United States Air Force missile
squadron; the USAFT-38 supersonic twin-jet ad-

portant to any company concerned with
costs. New style steel racks are used in
the new method, shown in Figure 4.
Each size bar stock and type alloy is seg-
regated into individual racks. These racks
can be stacked for convenient grouping.
This arrangement also makes possible the
utilization of the same overhead hoist
used under the old method for transport-
ing stock in unit loads for fabrication.
Under the new method, excess bar
stock was stored in the above described
racks. The cost of these new racks is
approximately $12 per opening; thus the
200 openings used cost $2,400. The
racks are amortized over a ten-year period.
The daily cost of these racks is $.67. One
fork truck driver is paid $1.75 per hour
or $14 for an eigh-hour day. The total
cost of this method is, therefore, $15.78
per day. The old method cost $28 per
day which results in a saving of $12.22.
Castings and forgings that are pro-
duced in various departments to be ma-
chined at a later time are stored in
corrugated metal tubs. Under the old
method, large numbers of tubs were
stored as shown in Figure 5. They occu-
pied an extensive area which made pro-
tection of their contents against the
weather virtually impossible, particularly
during periods of high humidity. When
moisture droplets form on the parts,
they cause surface corrosion which, at
times, necessitates acid cleaning opera-
tions. This progress results in many
extra material handling operations as well
as a loss of scrapped material and low-
ered efficiency.
These losses led management to intro-
duce the new storage system shown in
Figure 6. In this system, the tubs are
stored in steel frames on three levels.
This method permits the contents of each
tub to be protected by new aluminum
covers. It also makes the plant look
orderly and occupies only approximately
1/3 as much ground space. The cost of
these racks is approximately $12 per
opening, or $2,400 for the 200 openings.
The racks are amortized over a ten-year
period for a daily cost of $.67. No esti-
mates are available of the financial value
of this more efficient utilization of
ground space nor of the increased avail-
ability of individual tubs, but it is
thought that it considerably overbalances
the cost of new steel racks in which the
tubs are stored.
Packaging Methods
The Mueller Brass Company supplies
fabricated parts and raw stock of brass,
bronze, and aluminum alloys to both re-
tailers and wholesalers and also to auto-
motive and aircraft and other industries.
The wide variety of parts supplied to
thees many buyers gives rise to many
problems in packaging and material han-
dling. The methods of packaging must,
therefore, be flexible in order to accom-
modate their respective needs. The
products sold can be divided roughly
into two main categories—small parts
and large parts.
The small parts include scores of items
such as plumbing elbows, motor bush-
ings, hydraulic connectors, valves, and
ornamental parts that are to be plated.
Formerly, such parts were generally
packaged in cloth bags of various sizes.
Each had a label describing the type and
quantity included. An inspection of
these parts required that the bags be
opened and items withdrawn and after
inspection, replaced in the bags. Thus,
the parts had to be rehandled several
times before they were placed in storage.
During these rehandlings, the cloth bags
were quite frequently damaged and even
cut open by the sharp edges of the parts
contained, and the contents were scat-
tered. Such an event made necessary a
gathering up and repackaging of parts
involved.
Some of the small parts were, however,
packaged in standard wooden boxes. The
number of parts placed in each box was
determined by the respective sizes. One
disadvantage of this practice was the
inflexibility of the quantity lots avail-
able. A purchaser may have desired in-
termediate quantities, but the system re-
quired that he buy in standard box lots.
Another disadvantage of this method re-
sulted from the added weight of the wood
used in the boxes. As a consequence, the
cost of. shipping was unnecessarily in-
creased. The weight of the wooden boxes
in a carload lot would be a considerable
part of the total, and, thereby, noticeably
add to the cost to the customer.
Even before the installation of the new
material handling equipment in the
plant, the management recognized that
the methods of packaging of smail parts
were outmoded. A study of new methods
of packaging small parts led to the sub-
stitution of a strong, transparent plastic
bag as a container. The advantage of
the new bags was at once evident. The
transparent bags made their contents
readily visible for inventory and did not
require labels such as were placed on
the older cloth bags. Neither did these
break open as easily during handling
As a result, the expense for repackaging
was minimized. It was also recognized,
very early, that the plastic bags were
much more attractive to the customers
than were the old cloth containers. The
transparent bags made possible an im-
mediate and positive identification.
Wholesalers were also relieved of much
of the repackaging which was necessary
when the old containers were used and
became damaged in transit. It should
also be noted that the original cost of the
plastic bags was slightly less than that of
the cloth bags formerly used.
Large Paris
In contrast with packaging small parts
in cloth bags, parts such as large valves.
elbows, forgings, castings, and the like
were formerly packaged in heavy wooden
boxes. The weight and the rough edges
of these larger items precluded the use
of cloth bags and they were, therefore,
as were some of the larger quantities of
small parts, packaged in heavy wooden
boxes. The wooden boxes had much the
same disadvantage that they had when
used as containers for small parts—they
were both expensive and unwieldy. As
a result, they were replaced by cardboard
boxes which were found to be amply
strong. These boxes weighed and cost
only a fraction as much as the wooden
boxes. The reduced weight of the indi-
vidual unit package in corrugated card-
board boxes materially reduced the
amount of material handling and storage
space required. Consequently, shipping
charges were noticeably reduced. The
company estimates a $25,000 annual sav-
ings using the new packaging methods
The new material handling methods
recently adopted by the Mueller Bras*
Company, as has been shown above, have
had very beneficial results. They have
reduced labor costs, reduced spoilage, re-
duced necessary storage space and very
noticeably increased the efficiency of pro-
duction.

superheated in this manner, in any clean,
smooth-walled vessel. All superheated
liquids are unstable and will boil vio-
lently upon the addition of excess heat
or upon the introduction of a foreign
object with rough edges, since the only
requirement for a superheated liquid to
boil is a starting point.
The ideal liquid for use in the bubble
chamber must be transparent, with a high
vapor pressure, and with a low surface
tension. It should have a high vapor
pressure so that the size of the bubbles
will tend to increase, and it should have
a low surface tension so that the forces
tending to collapse the bubbles will be
at a minimum. The liquids best filling
these specifications are diethyl ether, pen-
tane, butane, or propane. These liquids
are readily available, and they are also
desirable because they are rich in hydro-
gen (the single proton in the hydrogen
atom is the simplest possible target nu-
cleus).
Liquid hydrogen may be used in the
bubble chamber when a pure proton
target is desired. When neutron targets
are preferable, liquid deuterium, or
"heavy hydrogen," may be used. By
comparing the heavy hydrogen and the
ordinary hydrogen results, it is possible
to determine what portion of effects seen
are due to the extra neutron in the deu-
terium nucleus. For still other special
experiments, liquid helium can be used.
In order to see gamma rays, x-rays,
and uncharged particles, a very dense
liquid is used to increase the probability
of collisions which may reveal the posi-
tion of the particle, since uncharged pro-
jectiles do not ionize the atoms of liquid
in their wake. For this purpose some
rather exotic liquids have been used, in-
cluding stannic chloride, tungsten hexa-
fluoride, xenon, or methyl iodide dis-
solved in propane.
How Does the Bubble Chamber
Operate?
The superheating of the liquid medium
is essentially achieved by filling the
chamber with a pure liquid, raising both
the temperature and pressure above their
boiling points, and then releasing the
pressure. When the pressure is released,
the liquid suddenly becomes superheated
and unstable. If the glass walls are ex-
tremely smooth and clean, no boiling will
occur until an ionzing event in the liquid
causes an eruption. After recompression
the liquid is ready for a new expansion.
This type of chamber is called a "clean"
bubble chamber. An effective "clean"
bubble chamber is necessarily very small,
since the probability of the liquid being
triggered by cosmic rays in the atmos-
phere increases with the dimension of the
container.
Large bubble chambers are constructed
with metal walls and glass windows,
welded together with gaskets. Even
though boiling will occur at the gaskets
and the walls, it is possible to maintain
a low pressure within the bulk of the
liquid by expanding very rapidly. The
wall boiling eventually raises the pressure
throughout the liquid to a point where
it is no longer sensitive to ionizing
radiation. This period of sensitivity
ranges from a few milliseconds to a few
hundred milliseconds, depending on the
expansion device, the chamber design,
and the liquid used. Bubble chambers
operating in this fashion are called
"dirty" chambers, and may have dimen-
sions up to several cubic feet.
To reduce the hydrodynamic resistance
to the flow of the liquid during expan-
sion, a movable, flexible diaphragm may
be used as one wall of the chamber,
which provides accurate and rapid regu-
lation of the chamber pressure.
The bubble chamber, of course, has
little or no value unless used in con-
junction with a high energy particle ac-
celerator such as a cosmotron. (While
the entire development and testing of the
chamber took place at the University of
Michigan, the Michigan chamber was
used for physics experiments at the
Brookhaven Laboratory, one of the
world's largest linear particle accelerators,
a three-billlon-electron-volt cosmotron.)
Special electronic equipment is used to
synchronize the operation of the bubble
chamber with particle bursts from the
accelerator. Since several milliseconds
are required to expand the chamber, the
expansion process is begun before the
the particles are ejected from the accel-
erator, so that the chamber is fully sensi-
tive when the particle arrives.
Often high scpeed particle counters,
such as scintillation counters, are ar-
ranged to measure the number of par-
ticles entering the chamber, then giving
an electronic signal which flashes a
stroboscope light. After the flash an-
other signal is given to recompress the
liquid and to reset the camera in readi-
ness for the next beam of particles.
Applications of the Bubble Chamber
It has been observed that the energy
of particles may be determined from the
depth of penetration required to stop
them in a dense liquid. When the cham-
ber is immersed in a magnetic field the
curvature of the particle track enables
the physicist to determine its momentum.
From the density of bubbles along a
track, a particle's speed and charge may
be determined. The crookedness or "scat-
tering" of a track is a measure of a par-
ticle's momentum times its speed.
When combined with a simple geo-
metric measurements of track lengths and
angles between tracks, these measure-
ments can be used to calculate the masses,
charges, and lifetimes of the observed
particles. It is possible, for various types
of events, to similarly calculate the energ)
released, the relative frequency of differ-
ent kinds of processes, and the angular
distributions of outgoing particles.
Due to the density of the medium
used, a six-inch bubble chamber provider
as many collisions as a cloud chamber
140 feet long; thus the probability of
obtainng a photograph of an interesting
event is increased considerably. The de-
cay of a jr-meson into a ^-meson and
then into an electron is virtually unknown
in the cloud chamber; yet in the first
eleven minutes of the bubble chamber's
operation, eight of these events were
photographed.
By delaying the light flash, a track of
bubbles may be photographed in any
stage of its growth. (The bubbles grow
to a tenth of a millimeter in diameter
in a few microseconds. The number or
bubbles along a given track depends
upon the liquid's temperature.)
The most recent discovery of conse-
quence to come from the bubble cham-
ber was made by compiling complex
data from the University of Michigan
and from Columbia University. Scien-
tists found that sub-atomic particles, such
as pi-mesons and Lambda particles, ex-
hibit a series of properties which were
previous unsuspected of any particle
smaller than some of the more complex
molecules.
Thanks to the ingenuity of scientists,
scores of present problems are certain to
be solved, but the future will also present
scores of new and complex problems.
Quoting Dr. N. Cusack of London Uni-
versity, from the August, 1955 British
Publication "Discovery," ". . . the pain-
staking but quick work of several groups
of physicists has already shown that Dr
Glaser's suggestion is fruitful. The bub-
ble chamber works, and there is little
double that before long it will be solving
some nuclear problems and revealing
others. Little more can be asked of any
scientific instrument."

American Bar Association or the A.M.A.
Thus several codes of ethics existed, vari-
ous policies were expressed, political and
economic objectives were lacking in unity.
In short, we were jumping on our horses
and riding off in six different directions
at the same time. Congressman Jones
could not get the same story from any
two of us. He rightfuly decided we
didn't know what we wanted. Society
saw us as several groups rather than as
a unit profession.
Among the stronger of our specialty
organizations, are the group known as
the Founder Societies, which consists of
ASCE, ASME, AIEE, AIMME, AlChe.
These organizations have in late years
attempted to solve some of their common
problems through the forming of certain
inter-society bodies such the the Engi-
neers Joint Council and the Engineers
Council for Professional Development.
This has been a unity effort and has
much to its credit, but it has not resulted
in an individual membership organization.
The National Society of Professional
Engineers, a comparatively young organ-
(Continued from page 54)
ization, comprises over forty thousand
engineers from all specialties. To become
a member of this organization one must
first become a registered professional en-
gineer. This society is growing rapidly.
Its new office building in Washington,
D.C. houses its headquarters in a digni-
fied and strategic position for guarding
the political interests of the profession.
As the strength of the NSPE has
grown and its expressed purposes in the
general interest of the engineering pro-
fession as a whole have become better
understood, many engineers, including
the presidents of many of our principal
specialty societies, have expressed the
opinion that those societies should seri-
ously consider unification of its engineer-
ing profession, leaving the general pro-
motion of the professional aspects of
engineering in the eyes of the public, to
NSPE. The AIEE Council is sponsoring
a suggestion of this kind, and the ASME
Council has already approved it. Thus
it looks as though we are finally headed
toward the unification which we have
needed for many years.
The AIEE further suggests that NSPE
open its membership for a period of time
to unregistered engineers holding suit-
able grades in technical societies sub-
scribing to ECPD uniform membership
grade standards, whereupon the AIEE
Board will urge all of its members to
affiliate with NSPE. This would allow
many of our most highly respected engi-
neers who entered practice before regis-
tration laws were in effect, and who are
now too far advanced in years and ex-
perience to prepare for the registration
examination, to become members of
NSPE. The young engineers recently
graduating from engineering colleges
would be expected to become registered
engineers before being eligible for NSPE.
For this reason, it is extremely impor-
tant to all of our graduating seniors that
they take the State Board examination
as soon as possible. This matter should
not be overlooked nor delayed in the
slightest. Both the ASME and AIEE
along with other specialty groups are
strongly recommending that young engi-
neers become registered.
START TODAY TO
PLAN TOMORROW
By knowing about some of the projects underway at the
Babcock &amp; Wilcox Company, an engineer may see his
personal avenues of growth and advancement. For today
B&amp;W stands poised at a new era of expansion and
development.
Here's an indication of what's going on at B&amp;W, with
the consequent opportunities that are opening up for
engineers. The Boiler Division is building the world's
largest steam generator. The Tubular Products Division
recently introduced extruded seamless titanium tubing,
one result of its metallurgical research. The Refractories
Division developed the first refractory concrete that will
withstand temperatures up to 3200 F. The Atomic Energy
Division is under contract by the AEC to design and
build the propulsion unit of the world's first nuclear-
powered cargo vessel.
These are but a few of the projects — not in the plan-
ning stage, but in the actual design and manufacturing
phases — upon which B&amp;W engineers are now engaged.
The continuing, integrated growth of the company offers
engineers an assured future of leadership.
How is the company doing right now? Let's look at one
line from the Annual Stockholders' Report.

at least a few possible solutions will
probably be righting for acceptance in
the manager's thoughts. His problem
now is to conceive as many alternate
solutions as possible. As with the plumb-
ing fixtures manufacturer mentioned
above, blunders in decision making fre-
quently can be traced to narrow-minded
limitation of the scope of thinking. In-
deed, it is very rare that the most obvious
solution is the best. In fact, the obvious
solution is likely to be little more than
a restatement of the prejudices one
started out with, therefore reducing the
entire decision-making process to a su-
perfluous absurdity. Often it is advisable
to begin considerations with the most
absurd of all solutions and progress
toward the reaonable-seeming ones. In
order that fair consideration be given
to these radical schemes, each should be
spelled out in detail—the more unusual,
the more study should be given it. If
the idea is worthless, some insurmount-
able objection will arise to exclude it
from implementation. If it shows merit,
perhaps unusual success can be had—
nearly all revolutionary ideas were deve-i-
open from seeming absurdities. At any
rate, recommended or often used proce-
dures should be shied away from until
one is sure that nothing better can be
found. Remember, there is no single
"right" solution to problems of this type,
and 99 times out of 100 there is an
untried one which will be more satis-
factory than anything tried to date.
With a goodly number of both ra-
tional and irrational alternatives at hand,
weeding can begin. Keeping the problem
and the end result in mind, test each
solution independently. Compare the
cost in time and money in the event of
failure with the amount of gain possible
from each solution. Never risk more re-
sources than you can spare, as did the
plumbing fixtures manufacturer. Give-
special consideration to those solutions
which risk the minimum, even if the
gains from a more dangerous scheme are-
greater it is a common mistake to sup-
pose that a great deal must be risked
whenever an unorthodox solution is pro-
posed. An unusual solution may actually
risk much less than an everyday method;
if so, it is worthy of especially serious
consideration. If there is any point in the
decision process where conservatism is
desirable, it is here.
The risk tactor may be looked at from
several other standpoints in the course
of deciding between alternative paths.
One may ask, "How much of my loss
can be recouped in other ways, if my
solution is faulty?" For example, a plant
built to manufacture a product which is
a failure may often be employed to pro-
duce an accepted product later on. Or,
"Can the loss, in event of failure, be
borne?" Certainly GE and Bell Labs
can afford to undertake research projects
that an independent manufacturer could
not begin to undertake.
There are yet other considerations to
make while weeding. Is the solution
legal? Many mergers and the like which
would certainly be solutions to some
business problems would be in violation
of federal antitrust laws. Does one have-
rights? Perhaps another firm has a patent
on the process which seems to present
the- ideal solution. Is there time to apply
the solution? Perhaps a fine solution will
remedy the problem next month, but
what if we have but a week in which
to remedy things. Is the solution tem-
porary or permanent? There isn't much
point in renting a plant when a purchase
can be afforded and the facilities will be
needed for some years.
By this time there- may be any num-
ber of alternatives left: we hope that
there will be at least one. Unless there
are some highly unusual considerations
to be made, the remaining solutions are
of a great enough magnitude of accept-
ability to be entirely workable and ac-
ceptable. If one can coerce the boss or
the board to accept one of these, he may
consider his job accomplished.
Somewhat as an epilogue, some brief
suggestions on carrying out a decision
may be helpful. First, no decision should
be considered final as to its details. Alter
them when necessary, as the degree of
success or failure becomes apparent.
Avoid hasty changes to the basic sub-
stance of the decision, however. It is bet-
ter then to rescind the decision entirely.
There are three specific techniques of
decision making which deviate from the
standard method which we have gone
into in some detail. The first of these
is called "total think," a name given to
it by its developer, Dr. Fritz Zwicky,
scientific advisor to Hycon Mfg. Co.
Dr. Zwicky claims that total think is a
universal problem solving technique,
equally adaptable to any problem with
multiple factors of choice. The first step
in the use of total think is to isolate the
areas of choice that establish the nerd
for making a decision. For example, in
buying a car areas of choice would cer-
tainly include style, power, and priee.
S.-cond, the alternatives within each area
of choice are listed. To extend the ex-
ample, style might subdivide into sedan,
station wagon, and convertible. Price
would subdivide into ranges, such as $2-
3000, S3-3500, and $3500-4000, and
power into ranges such as 150-200, 200-
250, and 250-300 hp. Now, each set of
alternatives is considered as being placed
along a coordinate axis of some hypo-
thetical solid. This divides the solid into
smaller solids, which represent possible
solutions. Since there are three alterna-
tives in each of the three areas of choree
in our example, our solid conveniently
becomes a three-dimensional cube with
3x3x3 or 27 smaller solids within. There
are 27 solutions to the problem: perhaps
others can be eliminated by the non-
existence of certain models. For example,
if there is no convertible available with
less than 200 horsepower, there are 26
remaining possibilities. This arbitrary
setting up of all possible alternatives may
set up possibilities heretofore unsus-
pected. Finally, each combination of al-
ternatives is given an arbitrary value
proportional to its estimated desirability.
If the problem is simple enough, one
should be able by this time to list all the
possibilities in order of decreasing prefer-
ence. He is then ready to face the auto
dealers. Of course, this is a fairly ob-
vious problem compared to those which
the total think system is most valuable in
solving.
Brainstorming is a relatively new tech-
nique which does not, precisely speak-
ing, reach decisions, but rather suggests
alternate solutions tor further considera-
tion. It is conducted by a group of
persons meeting under very informal cir-
cumstances. There is no chairman, and
the only rule of order is that interruption
is not permissable. No negative state-
ments or disparaging remarks may be
made with reference to any solution
offered, but all ideas presented are re-
corded for further study. The principle
of brainstorming is that one idea tend-,
to suggest another, and that if the atmov
phere is informal and uncritical, ideas

no one had ever succeeded in
piercing such steel into tubes
without developing internal

Combustion Engineering Co.,

The problem was to make the

Thru metallurgical research,
they achieved the proper balance
of alloy elements that made it
possible to pierce 20 miles of

will be presented which otherwise would
not ever be mentioned for fear of ridi-
cule. These possible solutions can be
plugged into the standard decision
process just ahead of the stage of en-
grossment, and treated just as might be
the calculated recommendations of a for-
mal research committee.
Last, there are electrical and electro-
mechanical devices which aid in the mak-
ing of decisions by being storehouses for
human expressions, in which respect they
differ from the purely mathematical com-
puters which deal with absolutes. A
simple device consisting of a zero-center
voltmeter, batteries, and two rheostats
can be connected in a bridge arrange-
ment so that the number of degrees dif-
ference in shaft rotation of the potentio-
meters determines the voltage applied to
the meter. If "A" is advanced more than
"B," a positive voltage will be the re-
sultant and the meter will deflect to the
right. If the relative amounts of rota-
tion are reversed, then the impressed
voltage will be of reverse polarity, and
the meter will deflect to the left.
This device will handle any of the
dilemma-type problems already referred
to by selecting the more advantageous
of two courses of action. All the advan-
tages of "A" are translated into rotations
of one rheostat; advantages of "B" into
rotations of the other. Disadvantages
gain consideration through reverse rota-
tion of the controls. Finally, the bat-
teries are connected and the deflection
direction of the meter needle shows the
preferable decision, and also tells by how
great a margin it is preferable. Of
course, it seems that any human could per-
form the same evaluation mentally, since
the machine only weighs one's own im-
pressions anyway. However, when prob-
lems consist of a great number of factors
it is difficult to hold the significance of
each in its proper light simultaneously.
It is here that simple devices such as
described and many more complicated
have real merit. They retain infinite
numbers of impressions, in the form of
aggregates, without letting prejudices or
afterthoughts bother them. The complex-
ity of such devices ranges up to the
analog computer, which can evaluate
solutions from seminumerical data with
amazing facility.
Suppose one wishes to use an electrical
decision machine to evaluate the relative
merits of, say, cutting a class quiz in
favor of putting in an hour on an im-
portant paper which is due in the class
immediately following the one in ques-
tion. First, the quiz is in a 3 hour course,
but the paper is for a 4 hour course.
Therefore, advance A 30°, B 40°. Pres-
ently a grade of "C" is forthcoming in
each class. The quiz will count 5 per
cent of the grade in A, the paper 10
per cent of the grade in B. Leave A at
30°, advance B to 80°. However, since
the paper is nearly complete as it is, there
is little chance of improving the grade
more than 10 per cent, while on the
quiz it is all or nothing. Leave A the
same, reduce B to 8°. Other factors
could be considered, but it is apparent
that at this point, this student had best
take the quiz: it is mathematically to his
advantage by a ratio of 30:8, or prefer-
able by 15 to 4. A cursory evaluation of
the problem might have led to the con-
clusion that the paper was more im-
portant and for a more significant course,
and therefore deserved the time.
No decision technique, no matter how
cautious or polished, is ever riskless, and
no decision is ever entirely safe. How-
ever, a reasonably rational approach to
making decisions will produce consist-
ently better results than any combination
of guesswork and luck.

Answers to Technic Teasers
The answer to the first Technic teaser is easy. By placing
one of the matches on the right side on the non equation
and placing it to the top of the V on the left side of the
equation, the following identity is made. This is shown below
V
The answer to the second Technic teaser is just as easy
By removing only seven matches a figure as shown below can
be made and is shown below.
The answer to the fourth problem is that the blind man
must have had a white hat on. He reasons this as follows
The one-eyed prisoner must have seen at least one white
hat because had he seen two red hats he would have known
immediately that his own hat was white. Now the one-eyed
prisoner looks at the blind prisoner, but he can not tell the
color of his own hat. Therefore the blind prisoner realize*
that he can not have a red hat since if he did, the one-eyed
prisoner would have known the color of his own hat It
would have had to have been white since the normal visiontd
prisoner saw at least one white hat. The one-eyed prisoner
couldn't tell the color of his own hat, and therefore the
blind man's hat must be not red but white.

No engineering position

a "free ride".
The old rules still apply:
a successful career
depends on the amount of
ability you have
and on the capacity of a company
to make good use of that ability.

the other: "Watch me embarrass a seat
from one of the men."
Pushing her way through the standees,
she bore down on a gentleman who
looked substantial and embarrassable.
"My deah Mr. Brown," she gushed,
"fancy meeting you on the car. Am I
glad to see you—you're getting to be
almost a stranger. Oh, am I tired!"
The sedate gent looked up at the girl
he'd never seen before and as he arose,
he said for all to hear: "Sit down, Bertha,
my girl, we don't often see you out on
wash day. No wonder you're tired. By
the way, don't deliver the washing till
Wednesday. My wife's going to the dis-

No. 33 in a Kodak Series
The Army's first operational rotor-tip
propelled jet helicopter—built by Hiller.
The camera has caught the fuel spray
pattern within the rear end of the ram-
jet engine even though passing by at
about 450 miles per hour.
Project:
Inspect rotor tip jets for a whirlybird
Hiller Helicopters wanted facts on the fuel spray pattern of a ram-jet engine
whirling at speeds up to 700 feet per second. Photography got the job.
WHEN HILLER HELICOPTERS of Palo AltO, Cal.
—a pioneer in vertical take-off aircraft—
developed a rotor-tip ram-jet engine, they knew
the fuel spray would be subject to high air velocity
and centrifugal force up to 1200 G's. Would the
fuel spray be deflected outward and cause the
jet to lose thrust? They wanted to know. So they
set up the camera with its fast eye to catch what
otherwise couldn't be seen. And they learned the
right angle of air intake and nozzle to obtain the
greatest power.
Using photography in research is an old story
with Hiller—just as familiar as using it for
improving public relations. It's an example of
the way photography plays many important roles
in modern-day industry.
In whatever work you do you will find that
photography will play a part in improving prod-
ucts, aiding quality control and increasing sales.
This is all the human eye could have seen of the
whirling ram-jet engine as camera takes its picture.
CAREERS WITH KODAK
With photography and photographic processes
becoming increasingly important in the business
and industry of tomorrow, there are new and
challenging opportunities at Kodak in research,
engineering, electronics, design and production.

One of a series'
Interview with General Electric's
W. Scott Hill
Manager — Engineering Recruiting
Qualities I Look For
When Recruiting Engineers
Q. Mr. Hill, what can I do lo get the
most out of my job interviews?
A. You know, we have the same
question. I would recommend that
you have some information on what
the company does and why you be-
lieve you have a contribution to
make. Looking over company in-
formation in your placement office
is helpful. Have in mind some of the
things you would like to ask and try
to anticipate questions that may
refer to your specific interests.
Q. What information do you try to get
during your interviews?
A. This is where we must fill in be-
tween the lines of the personnel
forms. I try to find out why partic-
ular study programs have been fol-
lowed, in order to learn basic motiva-
tions. I also try to find particular
abilities in fields of science, or math-
ematics, or alternatively in the more
practical courses, since these might
not be apparent from personnel rec-
ords. Throughout the interview we
try to judge clarity of thinking since
this also gives us some indication of
ability and ultimate progress. One
good way to judge a person, I find,
is to ask myself: Would he be easy
to work with and would I like to
have him as my close associate?
Q. What part do first impressions play
in your evaluation of people?
A. I think we all form a first im-
pression when we meet anyone.
Therefore, if a generally neat ap-
pearance is presented, I think it
helps. It would indicate that you
considered this important to your-
self and had some pride in the way
the interviewer might size you up.
Q. With only academic training as a
background, how long will it be before
I'll be handling responsible work?
A. Not long at all. If a man joins a
training program, or is placed direct-
ly on an operating job, he gets
assignments which let him work up
to more responsible jobs. We are
hiring people with definite consider-
ation for their potential in either
technical work or the management
field, but their initial jobs will be
important and responsible.
Q. How will the fact that I've had to
work hard in my engineering studies,
with no time for a lot of outside activi-
ties, affect my employment possibilities?
A. You're concerned, I'd guess, with
all the talk of the quest for "well-
rounded men." We do look for this
characteristic, but being president
of the student council isn't the only
indication of this trait. Through
talking with your professors, for
example, we can determine who
takes the active role in group proj-
ects and gets along well with other
students in the class. This can be
equally important in our judgment.
Q. How important are high scholastic
grades in your decision to hire a man?
A. At G.E. we must have men who
are technically competent. Your
grades give us a pretty good indica-
tion of this and are also a measure
of the way you have applied your-
self. When we find someone whose
grades are lower than might be ex-
pected from his other characteristics,
we look into it to find out if there
are circumstances which may have
contributed.
Q. What consideration do you give work
experience gained prior to graduation?
A. Often a man with summer work
experience in his chosen aca
field has a much better idea of what
he wants to do. This helps us decide
where he would be most likely to
succeed or where he should start his
career. Many students have had to
work hard during college or sum-
mers, to support themselves. These
men obviously have a motivating
desire to become engineers that we
find highly desirable.
Q. Do you feel that a man must know
exactly what he wants to do when he is
being interviewed?
A. No, I don't. It is helpful if he
has thought enough about his in-
terests to be able to discuss some
general directions he is considering.
For example, he might know whether
he wants product engineering work,
or the marketing of technical prod-
ucts, or the engineering associated
with manufacturing. On G-E train-
ing programs, rotating assignments
are designed to help men find out
more about their true interests be-
fore they make their final choice.
Q. How do military commitments affect
your recruiting?
A. Many young men today have
military commitments when they
graduate. We feel it is to their ad-
vantage and ours to accept employ-
ment after graduation and then ful-
fill their obligations. We have a
limited number of copies of a De-
partment of Defense booklet de-
scribing, in detail, the many ways in
which the latter can be done. Just
