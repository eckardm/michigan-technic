A Brief History of the Development of the
Steam Turbine
PROFESSOR J. E. EMSWILER
Among all the wonderful works of
modern man, none appeal more to the
imagination than those huge dynamic
structures whose function it is to man-
ufacture useful power out of the en-
ergy that nature has furnished in pri-
mary forms. Measured in terms of
magnitude of individual capacity, the
steam turbine stands preeminent in
the field of prime movers. Its rise
from a position of speculative possi-
bility among engineers to its present
place of dominance in power produc-
tion, almost within the span of years
that measures the age of an upper-
classman in college, constitutes one of
the most romantic chapters of engi-
neering accomplishment.
Although the steam turbine, as a
commercially successful machine, is of
so recent development, the general
idea of its principles of operation is
far from new. In this connection, ref-
erence is usually made to a description
of a reaction steam turbine written by
Hero of Alexandria about 130 B. C.;
and also to an impulse machine de-
scribed by Branca of Rome in 1629.
Of course, neither of these ideas can
be considered as the beginning of the
development of the present day steam
turbine; yet reference to them is very
valuable as illustrating the naturalness
or simplicity of the fundamental prin-
ciples of this type of prime movers,
which, up to a certain point, is easier
of conception than a pressure engine.
The real beginning of the steam tur-
bine occurred in 1884, when Mr. C. A.
Parsons, of England, took out patents
in that country and others covering
the invention of a steam turbine. It
is an interesting fact that the type in-
vented by Mr. Parsons is neither the
pure reaction machine of Hero nor
the pure impulse wheel of Branca, but
is a combination of the two principles,
much more difficult to conceive and
explain than either; and he has ad-
hered to this type, which has come to
be known as the Parsons type of tur-
bine, throughout his long and success-
ful career as a turbine inventor and
designer. It is the only commercial
turbine that now intentionally makes
use of the reaction principle.
Other inventors, before Parsons,
had quite generally suggested the plan
of compounding or multiplying the
number of stages to render blade
speeds efficiently compatible with
steam speeds. But Parsons appears
to be the first inventor to possess a
sufficient knowledge of thermodynam-
ics and mechanics to enable him to in-
telligently determine the number of
stages necessary for a given result, and
what was to occur in each stage. His
plan is to dole out the available heat
of the steam in small amounts by ex-
pansion in both the stationary and
moving elements of the turbine, re-
quiring that each increment of velocity
so formed shall be practically con-
verted into work on the moving blades
before further expansion and velocity
generation occurs. With this plan
there is no large accumulation of ve-
locity, or large scale energy trans-
formations, but rather a continuous
conversion of available heat into me-
chanical work, with a minimum
(i)

amount of energy at any instant exist-
ent in the transitional state of kinetic
energy of the steam.
The next contribution to the art was
made by Gustaf de Laval, of Stock-
holm, Sweden, about 1889, who in-
vented the well-known De Laval typ?
of impulse turbine. De Laval's plan
of utilizing the energy of the steam
was almost diametrically opposite to
that of Parsons. He first changed the
entire amount available heat of the
steam (excepting unavoidable losses)
into kinetic energy of the steam in a
single step or stage; and then convert-
ed as much as possible of the kinetic
energy into turning effect on a single
wheel. The steam velocity in this type
of turbine is enormous and rotor speed
is extreme. De Laval embodied in his
turbine at least four new ideas that
may be considered as his distinct con-
tribution to the advancement of the
steam turbine.
a. He employed a divergent nozzle,
properly designed to allow the
generation of the maximum ve-
locity from the available heat of
the steam.
b. He constructed a wheel designed
to withstand the tremendous
stresses induced by centrifugal
force.
c. He employed the daring expe-
dient of a very small flexible
shaft.
d. He successfully used mechanical
gears, running at unprecedented
speeds, to reduce the rotational
velocity of his turbine to the re-
quirements of driven machinery.
Too much Credit cannot be given to
this wonderful inventor, not only for
the origination of so many good ideas
grounded in correct theory, but also
for the successful design and produc-
tion in workable form.
In 1896, Curtis, an American, took
out a patent which became the basis
of construction of the well-known Cur-
tis turbine. Curtis employed the diver-
gent nozzle of De Laval, but in con-
junction with multiplicity of stages,
either in the reduction of the pressure
or the abstraction of velocity by the
blades, or both. Neither the idea of
the divergent nozzle nor the multi-
plicity of stages were original with
Curtis. But he was the first to exhibit
a clear understanding of what could
be done or should be done with mul-
tiple pressure and velocity staging as
applied to the impulse turbine.
Upon the inventions of these three
men, Parsons, De Laval, and Curtis,
have been developed the principle
commercial types of turbines that exist
today; and it is an interesting and
pleasing circumstance that all three of
these distinguished men lived to expe-
rience the satisfaction of witnessing
and participating in the remarkable
developments of the machines which
their labor genius first presented to
the world. Mr. De Laval died in 1913.
Mr. Parsons and Mr. Curtis are still
living.
A considerable number of1 steam
turbine patents were granted in various
countries during the last 100 years,
and upon a few of them, machines
were produced that enjoyed a brief
commercial success. One of these was
a turbine patented by A very, an Amer-
ican, in 1831, to operate upon the pure
reaction principle. Avery built about
50 of these reaction machines at Syra-
cuse, New York, and some of them
were used a number of years chiefly
for driving saw-mill machinery. The
Avery turbine consisted of two hollow
arms extending in opposite directions


from the shaft at the center. The
shaft was also hollow, and steam was
admitted through it to the arms. At
the end of each arm was a nozzle, or
"issue," as it was called in the patent,
of '/$" x l/\" rectangular opening, ar-
ranged so that the direction of the jet
emerging from it was opposite to the
direction of motion of the arms them-
selves. The diameter of the rotor
appears to have been from 5 to 7 feet,
housing, the steam jet issuing directly
into the atmosphere. The front edges
of the revolving arms were made very
thin, and were hardened and ground
to a knife edge to reduce friction and
wear. The two principle objections to
the Avery turbine were the noise of
the escaping steam and the difficulty
of gearing down to a practical speed
for the mill. In spite of the incorrect
design of nozzles, the high windage

and it is stated that the tip speed was
from 10 to 1^/2 miles per minute,
which is the equivalent of 880 to 1300
feet per second. The latter figure was
certainly a dangerous speed. Even De
Laval, with his excellent mechanical
construction, including the disc wheel,
varying in thickness from rim to hub,
designed for uniform stress from cen-
trifugal force, has not ventured higher
than 1400 feet per second peripheral
speed. The Avery turbine had no
loss resulting from the rotation of the
arms in the air, and the frictional dif-
ficulties encountered in the stuffing
box, by means of which high pressure
steam was delivered from the station-
ary chest into the revolving element,
the steam rate of the turbine is said
to have compared favorably with that
of reciprocating engines of the time.
In 1882, De Laval patented a pure
reaction turbine. He built quite a
large number of small capacity tur-
IBEF


bines on this principle, employing
them to secure the necessary high
speed for his cream separators. He
abandoned the reaction type later for
the impulse turbine already alluded to.
About 1894, Mr. Rateau, a French
inventor, brought out an impulse tur-
bine patterned after the Pelton water
wheel. This type has had some prom-
inence from time to time in the hands
of various manufacturing companies,
with the net result that it has been
practically abandoned except in appli-
cation, somewhat modified, to a few
makes of turbines in small sizes.
pumps, it was perhaps natural that the
inventor should seek to suggest the
practical application of his machine to
the most common power load. Early
inventors gave a great deal of atten-
tion to the problem of designing a re-
versible turbine. There seems to be no
successful solution for this problem
other than a practical or complete
duplication of elements.
In 1895, the Westinghouse Machine
Company, of Pittsburgh, Pa., secured
the right to manufacture the Parsons
turbine in this country. In 1899, the
first three turbines built bv the West-

Among the earliest steam turbine
patents of which there is a record is
one granted in England in 1784 to
Wolfang de Kempeln. His idea was
a reaction turbine of the Hero type,
but the peculiar and interesting fea-
ture of the sketch accompanying hi=
patent is a crank and connecting rod
for converting the rotation of the tur-
bine to reciprocating motion. At the
present time reciprocating motion is
looked upon as a handicap for a prime
mover for most kinds of service; but
in those days, where the chief use for
power was the operation of mine
inghouse Company were installed in
the power house of the Westinghouse
Air Brake Company. These units
were of 400 K. W. capacity each, and
constituted the first turbine power in-
stallation of importance in this coun-
try. In the next year, 1900, a 2000
K. W. turbine, running at 1200 R. P.
M., was installed in the plant of the
Hartford Electric Light Company, of
Hartford, Conn. This turbine, illus-
trated by Fig. 1, was the cause of con-
siderable comment and discussion on
the part of engineers, both in this
country and in Europe, inasmuch as


its capacity was fully twice as great
as any turbine that had ever been built.
Some years later the Allis-Chalmers
Company, of Milwaukee, Wis., also
secured rights to build the Parsons
turbine in this country, so that the
Parsons turbine is now manufactured
here by both the Westinghouse and
Allis-Chalmers Companies.
Shortly after Curtis' patent of 1896
the General Electric Company, of
Schenectady, N. Y., acquired the
rights to build turbines under the Cur-
replaced by a more modern unit of
larger capacity. The old pioneer was
brought back to Schenectady and
erected in front of the Turbine De-
partment building. A photograph of
this turbine as it now appears is shown
on the frontispiece. The larger sizes
of 500 K. W. and above, built by the
General Electric Company were orig-
inally of the vertical style, with the
electric generator surmounting the
turbine; but after some ten or twelve
years the vertical style gradually yield-

marine and aerial navigation. The
first Curtis turbine, of 600 K. W. ca-
pacity, was turned out about 1901, and
was installed in the pow?r plant of the
General Electric Company at Schenec-
tady. In 1903, the first 5000 K. W.
unit, then by far the largest in capacity
that had ever been built, was com-
pleted and installed in the Fiske Street
Station of the Commonwealth Edison
Company, of Chicago. It was in op-
eration from October 2, 1903, to May
29, 1909, when it was dismantled to be
ed to the horizontal, which is more
popular among operating engineers
and better adapted to prevent vibration
with the tendency toward higher rota-
tional speeds.
The development of the steam tur-
bine, especially in the larger capacities,
has progressed hand in hand with that
of the electric generator. As so tersely
expressed by Mrs. O'Riley, comment-
ing upon the affectionate relations ex-
isting between her young son and that
of a neighbor, "they are as inseparable
as a pair of pants." The electric gen-


erator called the steam turbine into
practical existence, because of its de-
mand for a prime mover of high speed,
direct rotational motion, and steady
driving force. The steam turbine, on
the other hand, has inspired the ad-
vancement of the electric generator by
meeting and exceeding its demand for
high speed, until now few, if any,
shell construction with but one genera-
tor, and the latter a so-called "com-
pound'' unit, consisting of a high pres-
sure, intermediate pressure, and two
low pressure shells, each with its sep-
arate generator, but all combined as a
single commercial unit. The single
and multiple cylinder styles of large
capacity modern steam turbines are

turbo-generator units up to 2500 K.
W. capacity run at anything less than
3600 R. P. M., the maximum speed
possible for the generation of 60-cycle
current.
In capacity of units there has been
a steady advance until, at the present
time, turbo-generators of 45,000 K.
W. and 60,000 K. W. have been pro-
duced and are in operation ; the former
consisting of a turbine of a single-
illustrated by Figs. 2 and 3. The mag-
nitude of such units is not only ex-
pressed by the output in kilowatts that
they are capable of producing, but also
interms of the quantity of steam that
they can handle. Take the case of a
45.000 K. W. unit as an example: at
full load, the total steam consumed per
hour is nearly half a million pounds
or 250 tons; while the volume of the
steam as it is discharged to the con-

denser at the not unusually low back
pressure of one inch absolute will be
about 286,000,000 cubic feet per hour
—a cataract of steam of almost half
the volume of water of the Falls of
Niagara.
The widest application of the steam
turbine is to the driving of the electric
generator. In smaller capacities it is
used to drive fans, centrifugal pumps,
condenser auxiliaries, etc. From the
first the possibilities of the turbine for
ship propulsion has been considered.
Its uniform turning force, together
with its small size and weight as de-
veloped for land work, naturally com-
mended the turbine for marine adap-
tation. Actual application of the tur-
bine to the requirements of ship pro-
pulsion discovered many unfavorable
factors. The turbine is naturally a
high-speed machine, while the screw
propeller is a low-speed apparatus. It
is necessary, therefore, to bring the
speed of the turbine down to the re-
quirements of the propeller. This can
be done in several ways: by multply-
ing enormously the number of stages;
by large diameters of rotors; by me-
chanical gearing; and by electrical
connection from a generator, through
controls and motors, to the propeller
shaft. It is to be noted in this con-
nection that one of the main advan-
tages of the steam turbine, viz., its
small size and weight for large capaci-
ties, is realized only when the turbine
may deliver its power at high speed.
For every speed reduction, no matter
how accomplished, the penalty of an
increase of size and weight and ex-
pense of manufacture must be paid.
Hence, the marine turbine plant must
be a bulky, ponderous affair as com-
pared with its brother of the land, and
it has required a longer time to bring
the marine turbine to a successful
competition with the marine recipro-
cating engine. Furthermore, the tur-
bine in simple form is essentially a
one-speed machine, in the sense that
it has some speed of highest efficiency,
and if that speed is departed from a
great way on either side the efficiency
will fall off. Consequently, for service
where variable speed is necessary, as
for example in the navy, some means
of varying the speeds without sacrifice
of efficiency, had to be worked out.
This has been accomplished in two
ways: first, by varying the number of
stages through which the steam is ex-
panded; the slower the peripheral
speed of the rotor, the greater the
number of stages necessary to effect
complete expansion. As higher speeds
are required, fewer stages are needed,
so the steam is admitted further along
the turbine, by passing few or more
stages, as the case may require. The
second method is effected by means of
electrical transmission. One or more
turbo-generator sets, possessing all the
advantageous features of a land unit
in respect to high speed, small size and
weight, comprise the power-generating
equipment of the ship. The electrical
energy is conveyed through proper
controls to motors which operate the
propellers.
The points just alluded to will indi-
cate the greater complexity of the
problem of successfully applying the
turbine to marine work. From the be-
ginning. Parsons has been one of the
most active engineers in advancing the
marine turbine. The first turbine-
driven ship was the Turbinia, a small
vessel of 44^/2 tons displacement, 100
feet long, which was equipped with a
Parsons turbine about 1895. From
that time until the World War there
was a gradual development of the ma-
rine turbine, until many of the largest

ocean liners were turbine-driven.
Nearly all of the installations were of
the Parsons type of turbine, chiefly
because more attention had been given
to its development for the purpose.
The war, with its insistent demand for
ships, gave a great impetus to the de-
velopment of turbines of all types for
marine work. Undoubtedly, the steam
turbine, with its relative simplicity of
construction and few parts requiring
fine fits, lent itself much better to man-
ufacture by shops not previously fitted
ed to two 175 K. \\\, 250 volt, bi-polar

The machine was manufactured in
England in 1901, and was delivered
to the Pennsylvania Salt Manufactur-
ing Company in 1902 at a price of
$30,000. It was perhaps the first ma-
chine of its kind shipped into the
United States.
It was designed to operate condens-
ing at 150 pounds steam pressure, and
was originally installed to exhaust into

steam turbine governing. The picture

one of the generators to the governing
valve, which, controlled by a solenoid,
adjusts the steam quantity or energy
supply to the demand.

Illumination Engineering
ASSISTANT PROFESSOR W. F. DAVIDSON, M.S.
For centuries philosophers have classified human beings according to
various characteristics,—the color of their skin, their habits of living or of
thought, or any of a thousand others. It would not introduce any novel
classification to separate mankind into groups according to ambitions or
aims: (i) those without ambition of any sort; (2) the vast majority, those
who want to do something. But this last group might well be divided into:
(a) people content to follow the well-trod path, content to do as their fore-
bears have done; (b) the few, who, not content always to follow a guide,
are determined to blaze new trails, to go where never man has gone before.
Surely, a man cannot aspire to the dignity of an engineer unless he come
within the last group. To the man filled with the wanderlust of the true
scientist or engineer, illumination engineering appeals as offering oppor-
tunities for great pioneer work. Do not understand that illumination engi-
neering is unique in this respect, for there is no branch or subdivision of
pure or applied science which does not offer a field for investigation that
would try the ability of any man. Human knowledge is not bounded by
solid walls; its .horizon keeps ever moving outward as the explorer pushes
on into new regions. But illumination engineering does present an extraor-
dinary number of almost untouched problans which have an added interest
because we can see that their solution has immediate practical value.
Before we go on to discuss these problems it may be well to examine,
for a moment, the work of Illumination Engineer. The layman often looks
upon the engineer as a man who spends his days bent over a drafting board,
or peering through the telescope of a transit and waving his arms in the air,
or using a slide rule to find out the size of wire necessary for connecting
up a motor. Those who are more intimately familiar with engineering
know that the true engineer does not spend his time in such ways. He is
a tireless searcher after truths which he uses in the shaping of natural forces
and materials for the benefit of mankind; he is a thinker and a doer. The
real illumination engineer is not greatly concerned with calculating wire
sizes and computing ''lumens," although he must know how such things are
done. More serious problems face him. He is concerned with the produc-
tion and utilization of light under the requirements imposed by an elaborate
economic and social system and the most complex of living things—man.
At first thought, the production of light'may not impress one as being
a very important subject. But consider to what extent our modern social
and economic structure depends on the artificial production of light. Imag-
ine our homes without lights of any sort; picture them even without electric
lights, and the importance of light will be apparent. An estimate for the
year 1919 shows that in the United States alone more than 2,500,000,000
kilowatt-hours of electric energy were used for lighting. It would require
a power plant of 300,000 kilowatts capacity running continuously at full
(9)


load for a year to produce such an amount of energy, but in reality
probably at least 1,800,000 kilowatts of generating equipment were required.
Even with the best economies of modern central stations the annual cost of
merely generating this energy would exceed $25,000,000.00, while the cost
of transmission and distribution would be several times this amount. To
convert this great amount of energy into light is the first problem. We
all have seen some of the great advances in the art of converting electric
power into light; we have seen the carbon lamp displaced by the metallized
filament; then, in rapid succession, the Nernst glower and the tantalum fila-
ment came into prominence, only to be displaced by the tungsten or Mazda
lamp. In arc lamps the carbon arc has been almost entirely supplanted by
various forms of luminous arc, and we have other comparatively new types
of lamp in the mercury arcs and the Moore tube. Each of these lamps
marks a development—an increase in efficiency or an improvement of the
quality of light emitted. But with all this progress we are still far from
reaching the ideal in efficiency. We must make great advances before we
can compete with the firefly, if efficiency is to be taken as the criterion. The
table below will be of interest in this connection:
EFFICIENCY OF ILLUMINAXTS

Candle 0.02 per cent
Kerosene lamp 0.04""

The sun 13.8"
Black body at 65000 K 15.6"
The firefly 96.5"
1Ideally perfect source 100.0 ""
In considering the possibilities of future development, it may be pointed
out that the possible attainable efficiency is not limited by theoretical restric-
tions as those imposed by the Carnot principle for the conversion of energy
from heat into mechanical form. If it were possible to increase the efficiency
of our lamps from present values to even half that of "tiny Salmoneus of
the air," it would make possible a saving of probably as much as 1,500.000
kilowatts in the generating equipment required, with a corresponding decrease
of $116,000,000 in power plant investment.
The problem is by no means a simple one. Our present knowledge of

plied into light of that particular wave-length which effects the eve most—i. e.. mono-
chromatic yellow-green at 0.556^.

ILLUMINATION ENGINEERING n
the mechanism of light production is meagre in the extreme. Electrons and
positive nucelii are realities, but the manner in which they produce light is
still largely a subject of conjecture. By way of illustration, we may con-
sider the question which the writer has been studying recently. For some
time it has been known that a flat kerosene lamp flame or a flat gas flame
emitted light almost equally in all directions, and on first thought it seemed
only consistent to assume that any luminescent gas would behave in the
same manner. However, a series of measurements has shown that a
Cooper-Hewitt mercury-vapor tube emits light of much greater intensity in
a direction normal to the tube than in directions oblique to it. The explana-
tion is not clear, and considerable experimental work has been outlined
with the hope that it will develop definite data on which to proceed. While
it is evident that the mere formulation of a satisfactory answer to the ques-
tion will not make it immediately possible to design illuminants of increased
efficiency, the very statement of the principle involved will be a step in the
direction of such advances. Taken in connection with other theories, it may
well point the way to the development of an entirely new type of lamp.
Such experiences as these only serve to remind us how slight our knowledge
really is, and to reveal new lands for conquest by him who has the ambition
and the analytical ability.
Quite as important as light production is the utilization of the light
after we get it. The light from the lamp must be guided to the place where
it is needed, and this must be done in such a day that the result is satisfac-
tory to oilr eyes and to our esthetic senses. Glare, sharp shadows, or too
great contrasts may defeat the very object of a lighting installation. Or a
lighting system may be unsatisfactory because the color of the light does
not properly show the object to be viewed, or because it is not in accord with
our ideals of beauty. During recent years great progress has been made in
the study of these requirements and in the development of methods to sat-
isfy them, but much remains to be done.
To the casual observer it would probably seem that almost anyone with
a moderate amount of ingenuity might be able to make considerable contri-
butions along this line. However, on closer study it becomes evident that
broad experience and training are essential. The factors to be considered
include such widely different concepts as the physical behavior of reflectors
and the psychological effects of varying degrees of contrast. Of course,
there are numerous investigations which may be carried to a considerable
extent without taking up the study of such widely diverse subjects as have
been suggested, yet this does not invalidate the general proposition.
One line of investigation which has recently been attracting much atten-
tion is directed toward determining the physical and chemical characteristics
which distinguish various reflecting surfaces. Comparatively little definite
information has been obtained on this subject. The properties of mirrors
and prisms and reflectors of such type are capable of rigid mathematical
analysis and have been known for many years. But of sucTi things as wall
papers and paints our knowledge is slight. We know that some are good
reflectors and that others are poor; a little is known of the specular reflecting

properties of glazed papers and enamel paints. Of the physical properties
we are almost wholly ignorant. A little thought will show mat if the paint
manufacturer is to produce paints of higher reflecting power, or with more
or less specular reflection, he must proceed by cut and try—the most expen-
sive of all ways—unless he have a well-established hypothesis to guide him.
Much of this argument about reflecting surfaces may seem aimless
unless we grasp a little of its practical significance. Anyone who has ever
worked in a room with dead black walls will appreciate in some degree the
value of having ceilings and walls which reflect some light. Annoying
shadows are reduced and there is a surprising increase in the amount of
available light. If we were to take a room with walls, ceiling, and floor
reflecting an average of 60 per cent of the light falling on them, and were
to refinish it so that the reflection coefficient were increased to 90 per cent,
the light in the room would be quadrupled without having made any change
in the lamps. If we were to make the reflection coefficient still higher, yet
still within reason, say 97.5 per cent, the light would be increased to sixteen
times its original value. It is not enough that the reflection coefficient be
high; it must be high for the particular color of light it is required to reflect.
For example, tests made recently show that a certain sample of red paper
had reflection coefficients of 0.043, OI9. and 0.023 under three different
kinds of light, while a blue sample showed 0.22, 0.16, and 0.14 and a yellow
sample 0.38, 0.46, and 0.85 under the same series of lights. Here we have
surfaces showing for certain lights more than eight times the reflecting
power obtained with other lights. The reasons for this are only partly
understood and there is a big field for development. The effect of dirt and
of age on reflecting values is also quite indefinitely known at present, yet it
is of real importance, and investigations have been started by the Depart-
ment of Electrical Engineering to secure some data on this point.
Possibly some may ask what opportunities exist for a man devoting
his energies to such work. The answer is simply that the opportunity is as
big as the man . Pecuniary reward is made essential by our social system
and must generaly be considered. But in a field representing as great an
investment as does illumination engineering there are many who can and
will pay the real pioneer whatever he may ask. And with equal force, this
is true of any other line of endeavor. There is always room—the world will
make room, if need be—for the man who excells in any line of honest work.

PROFESSOR N. H. WILLIAMS
The electron tube as used in radio
communication has so revolutionized
the commercial operations connected
with wireless work that it is attracting
the attention of people whose own
work is not even remotely connected
with the problems of communication.
It will, therefore, not be out of place
to present a very simple treatment of
this subject to those readers of the
TECHNIC who are devoting themselves
to other lines of work and have never
made any study of radio phenomena.
Mechanical systems which are ca-
pable of oscillating have, in general,
two ways in which energy may be
stored in them. There must also be a
way by which energy may be trans-
formed from the one type to the
other. A simple pendulum has kinetic
energy when it is in motion which be-
comes a maximum when the pendulum
reaches the middle of its path. At
either end of its path the energy is all
potential. Vibrating springs, vibrating
strings, and vibrating air colums have
the same properties, and in each case
the period is expressed as
The meanings of x and y depend upon
the nature of the vibrating system.
An electric system consisting of a coil
of wire of inductance, L, and a con-
denser having capacity C, has also two
ways of storing energy. When the
condenser is charged with a difference
of potential between its terminals
equal to E, its energy is l/2 CE2. When
the condenser is discharged through
the coil, a current I flows through the
wire and energy is stored in the mag-
netic field, its value at any instant
being l/2 LP. The energy is alter-
nately stored in the condenser and in
the magnetic field and continues to
surge back and forth until it is all
dissipated in the form of heat. The
period of the oscillation in this case is
By making L or C small, the period
may be made short and the frequency
high. When such a system oscillates
at high frequency, a part of its energy
is radiated in the form of an electro-
magnetic wave which travels with the
speed of light. Such an oscilatory

system may be operated by an induc-
tion coil, and it may be coupled induc-
tively to a coil placed between the
ground and an aerial conductor or an-
tenna which furnishes a means of
radiating a large fraction of the energy
of the oscillation. Fig. i illustrates
this method of producing electromag-
netic radiations. When the potential
difference between the terminals of the
secondary of the induction coil rises
the condenser is charged, and when
the potential difference reaches a suf-
ficiently high value a spark occurs at
the gap, O, which virtually closes the
circuit and leaves the condenser and


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the coil connected. The energy of the
charge then oscillates with a period of
2irVLC. The induced electromotive
forces in coil L' cause electric currents
to surge up and down the antenna, and
thus electric and magnetic strains in
the ether are set up which are propa-
gated as an electromagnetic wave
train. The magnetic stress due to the
electric current in the vertical antenna
is horizontal, while the electric stress
due to the charge in the antenna is
approximately vertical. A transformer
with a magnetic shunt is usually used
instead of the induction coil. The sec-
ondary of such a transformer may b°
short circuited without damage. Fre-
quencies decidedly beyond the audible
range are necessary in order that a
considerable fraction of the energy
may be radiated.
In order to understand how an elec-
tromagnetic wave may be detected
after it has traveled a long distance,
it is necessary to appreciate the impor-
tance of the phenomena of resonance.
Suppose a mechanical system, capable
of executing vibrations of a given fre-
quency, to receive an impulse of such
a nature that it tends to start oscilla-
tions. If this impulse is repeated over
and over again, always at the right
time, so that the effect of each impulse
is added to the effects of those that
preceded, an oscillation of consider-
able amplitude is built up. The con-
dition for resonance, then, is that the
period of the applied impulse shall
equal the free period of the vibrating
system. A circuit consisting of a coil
of wire and a condenser is an oscilla-
tory system whose natural period may
be varied by changing either the num-
ber of turns of wire or the capacity
of the condenser. When a train of
electromagnetic waves reaches such a
system, if the circuit is tuned to the
frequency of the wave train, oscilla-
tions will be set up and there will be
an alternating potential difference be-
tween the terminals of the condenser.
If a telephone receiver were connected
across the terminals of the condenser,
this alternating potential difference
would be applied to the telephone, but
no sound would be heard, since the
frequency of the oscillation is beyond
the audible range. If we assume that
the waves come in trains, one wave
train for each spark, still there is no
effect upon the telephone that is audi-
ble. If, however, a rectifier be put in
circuit with the telephone, the dia-
phragm of the telephone receives one
impulse for each wave train, and hence
a sound is produced that has the fre-
quency of the wave trains. This sound
is usually a musical note of rather high
pitch. If, now, the wave trains are
interrupted at the sending station to
form dots and dashes, telegraphic sig-
nals are possible.
Crystal rectifiers and electrolytic
rectifiers have been used successfully
as detectors, but the electron tube has
so many advantages over the simple
rectifier that it has opened up possi-
bilities in radio work that were not
suspected when the tube was first put
into use. The tube, when used as a
simple rectifier, has two electrodes,
one a wire heated to incandescence by
an electric curent and known as the
filament; the other a sheet of metal
called the plate. Incandescent bodies
emit electrons very much as a hot
liquid throws off a vapor, and if a
positively charged plate is placed near
the filament these electrons are attract-
ed by the plate, and thus they become
the carriers by means of which the cur-
rent is conveyed across the evacuated
space in the tube. This thermionic
emission is very copious in the case


of certain oxides. A wire coated with
calcium oxide need only be heated to
a dull red to emit electrons in large
numbers. Tungsten, on the other
hand, requires a brilliant white heat
for good results. If the plate is con-
nected to the negative terminal of the
battery and the filament to the positive,
the electrons are repelled by the plate
and no current is conducted through
the tube. Thus, it appears that the
tube is a rectifier and in fact a more
nearly perfect rectifier than any of the

rig. a.
others that have been used. It may
be substituted with excellent results
for the crystal rectifier. Fig. 2 shows
how the two electrode tubes known as
the kenotron, may be used as a recti-
fier in a simple detector circuit.
The next step in the development of
the electron tube consisted in inserting
a grid or mesh of fine wire between
the filament and the plate. Since the
electrons must flow through this grid
in order to convey current through the
tube, it is evident that the potential of
this grid may determine the current.
If the grid is charged negatively, it
will repel the electrons and prevent
their reaching the plate, while if it is-
charged positively it will accelerate
their motion and thus increase the cur-
rent. An experiment that strikingly
illustrates this function of the grid
may be explained by means of Fig. 3.
The grid, G, of the tube is connected
to a wire two or three feet long thai
is free in space. The battery and a
relay are connected between the fila-
ment and the plate. The relay arma-
ture is drawn forward with consider-
able force as the filament is heated and
the tube becomes a conductor. The
relay is so arranged that the local cir-
cuit is open when the armature is

Fig. 3.
drawn forward and closed when the
armature is released. The local cir-
cuit is not shown in the figure. When
a charged rubber rod is brought within
a few feet of the wire connected to the
grid, the grid becomes negatively
charged and the battery current is re-
duced to a small value or perhaps to
zero. The relay armature is then re-
leased and it closes the local circuit
and operates whatever apparatus is
used in the secondary circuit. A bell
may be rung, lamps lighted, or a motor
started. The energy supplied to the
grid is too small to be measured, and
yet it is evident that practically any
amount of energy may be under the
control of any agent that can vary the

IET


potential of the grid by thirty or forty
Volts. An electromagnetic wave from
a distant source is capable of produc-
ing this variation of grid potential,
and thus may be made the means of
controlling large amounts of energy
supplied by a local generator.
Fig. 4 shows a modification of the
simplest type of receiving circuit that
finds extensive application. It is
known as the regenerative amplifier.
An electromagnetic wave train coming
from a great distance may start a
feeble oscillation in the antenna and
communicate some of its energy to the

Fig. 4.
oscillating circuit which is assumed to
be tuned to the incoming wave. The
feeble oscillation in the oscillating cir-
cuit, operating on the grid of the tube,
causes a fluctuation of the plate cur-
rent furnished by the battery. The
battery circuit contains a coil, I,.., that
is coupled with the coil, L,. Hence,
there is induced in the oscillatory cir-
cuit an E. M. F. that is in phase with
the curent and power from the battery
circuit is supplied to the oscillatory
circuit. Thus, tl^ere is built up an os-
cillation of much greater amplitude
than could be produced by the electro-
magnetic wave alone. This is some-
what analogous to the way in which a
shunt generator, starting with only
residual magnetism in the field mag-
nets, may build up its voltage to a high
value.
When signals are too feeble to be
detected by the regenerative amplifier,
the primary of a transformer is put
into the plate circuit and the secondary
connected between the filament and
grid of another tube. If a step-up
transformer is used, a telephone in the
plate circuit of this second tube will
produce much louder signals than if
it were placed in the plate circuit of
the first tube. Such a system is called
a two-stage amplifier. Three, four, or
more stages are frequently used.
When the regenerative amplifier is
used, it is easily possible to make the
coupling between L! and L, so close
that if an oscillation is once started it
does not stop when the incoming sig-
nals cease. The system then becomes
a generator of high frequency oscilla-
tions and may be used as a source of
power in a transmitting set. It may
also be used as a receiving set for con-
tinuous waves by what is known as
the heterodyne method. The term
"continuous waves'' is used to desig-
nate undamped waves—i. e., waves
whose amplitude is maintained con-
stant. This name applies even though
the system of waves may be inter-
rupted at the transmitting station for
the production of signals. If we im-
agine a continuous train of undamped
waves coming to a station, they will
produce oscillations beyond the audible
range in the receiving circuits. If the
receiving apparatus be a regenerative
amplifying system, capable of oscillat-
ing independently, we shall have two
sets of oscillations in the circuit at the
same time. The receiving set can be
tuned to produce oscillations of any
desired frequency. Suppose the in-


coming waves to have a frequency of
60,000 cycles per second and the re-
ceiving set is tuned to produce 61,000
cycles per second. Then a beat note
or difference tone having a frequency
of 1,000 cycles per second would be
heard in the telephone. If the con-
tinuous waves from the transmitting
station were interupted to form the
dots and dashes of telegraphic signals,
the different tone heard in the tele-
phone would show the same interrup-
tions. Many of the high-power sta-
tions are of this kind, using continu-
ous waves produced by the Foul sen
arc.
The radio telephone represents only
one more step in the development of
this fascinating subject. If continuous
waves of high frequency can be mod-
ulated by a telegraph key, so can they
be modulated by a telephone transmit-
ter and high frequency ether waves
may be so altered in amplitude that
they may carry with them fluctuations
representing the vibrations of lower
frequency produced by the voice. One
way of accomplishing this modulation,
when the three-electrode tube is used
as a generator, is to connect the sec-
ondary of a small transformer into the
grid circuit of the tube. The primary
of this transformer is in circuit with
a battery and a telephone transmitter.
The grid potential is thus made to fluc-
tuate with the frequency of the sounds
of the voice while the system is send-
ing out high frequency waves. Since
the power sent out depends decidedly
upon the grid potential, the radiated
waves will be modulated in accordance
with sounds produced in the trans-
mitter.
It will be understood that only es-
sential principles and the simplest cir-
cuits have been discussed here and
that just beyond the limits of a brief
article like this lies an enormous field'
which can not fail to prove attractive
to any student of the physical sciences.

LANE HAH


DEAN MORTIMER E. COOLEY
It is trite to say that we live in a
wonderful age, and the optimist fails
in his predictions of the future only
for want of words yet uncoined. The
current of events is so swift that the
dawn of them, their noonday and eve-
ning have come and gone, and their
twilight soon merges into the darkness
produced by the brighter star of the
morning after. Whither does it all
trend, and what of us who have our
hand on the throttle, or ride behind,
unthinking and content, or dreaming
of the future, with no thought of the
past?
Yes, whither does it all trend?
Who better than the engineer to an-
swer that question? The engine driver
pulls the throttle for greater speed
and feels his air brake to control the
same. The captain sails his ship by
the quickest route, always on the look-
out for danger. The surgeon plies his
knife, ever watchful to avoid severing
tissues and arteries vital to the pa-
tient's welfare. The manufacturer
studies his machines and men in order
to increase his output. The farmer
tills his soil with the aid of chemistry,
and brings eugenics into the breeding
of his stock. The financier works his
money to make it produce its maximum
fold. Each in his own sphere is mas-
ter, but who, or where, or what is the
master of them all?
It is futile to personify, to individ-
ualize, to localize. Rather must we
look within to discover if there be not
something amiss, something which cor-
rected or adjusted would open our
minds to comprehend that the master
of them all is the great force of public
sentiment striving for public welfare,
controlling individuals for collective
good. In short, the great force which
when present, serves to perpetuate na-
tions, and which, when absent or undi-
rected, leads to their downfall.
History tells us of the rise and fall
of nations,—those of recent date, and
the archaeologist is beginning to tell
us of pre-historic nations. China's his-
tory of 4,000 years teaches one great
lesson all nations should learn. We
moderns look upon China and the
Indias as hopelessly behind in civiliza-
tion, but how many of us stop to think
that these races have existed for these
many thousands of years, and could go
on in the same way to perpetuate
themselves to the end of the world.
And yet, not one of the great natural
resources of these oldest countries of
the world has been more than merely
touched. We want to get into their
country to civilize them, all unthinking
of the fact that civilization in their
way is something for us to heed in
developing civilization in our way.
China and the United States are
about equal in territory extent. One
has a population of 400 millions, the
other 100 millions. What would the
United States do with 400 millions, liv-
ing as we now live? Would it not
be necessary to have our missionaries
return to teach us the civilization they
are now trying to undo in China?
China, too, is sending the pick of her
young men to this country to be edu-
cated, so that she may have her own
leaders in transplanting our civiliza-
tion to their country. What shall we
teach them? Rather, what shall we
not teach them? What is the lesson
to be learned, when the youth of these
(iS)


ENGINEERING IN A BROADER ASPECT
old eastern countries bring into their
answers to questions of public policy,
a philosophy so natural as to seem al-
most instinctive? In comparison, the
answers of our own youth to the same
questions, show as a light reflected,
not from within.
Students among teachers say that
our youths are left to be taught in
schools and colleges, and that there is
all too little of home teaching, all too
little of that early teaching which
moulds the character when the mate-
rial is still plastic. The excuse given
is that there is no time in the home
life. Parents must earn in order to
support their children. They must
rest when not working. Thus the
children are left to grow up like Top-
sy, and come to maturity, the product
of a neglected environment, fed and
clothed and feted, and schooled by
those who have themselves grown up
in a similar environment. What wond-
er then that we find ourselves con-
fronted with all sorts of social prob-
lems, the solution of which is not being
worked out, but is working itself out.
You are wondering what the engi-
neer more than anyone else has to do
with all this. Let me answer, or rather
point to the answer. We live in an
engineering age. Our modern civiliza-
tion is an engineering product. Were
the engineer's work to be stopped, civ-
ilization as we know it would stop.
The engineer's ancestor, the surveyor,
was the pioneer who went into the
wilderness and had charge of the task
of directing its conversion for the use
of man. Each, for yourself, can unfold
the story—a story more wonderful
than any Arabian Nights. The fam-
ily of the old surveyor has produced
so remarkable a genealogical tree, that
today his descendants are found in a
large number of branches of engineer-
ing, too large and too well known to
enumerate.
The engineer having produced the
structure of our modern civilization,
cannot now shirk the task of perpetu-
ating it. We are proud, not to say
boastful, of our work, and well we
may be, but the real work of the eng-
ineer is but now begun. Upon him de-
volves the task of making the country
support the growth of population. This
means, increasing our food-bearing
land, while co-workers in other fields
increase its productiveness. It means
bringing the food from remote dis-
tricts to the point of consumption. It
means many other things of a con-
structive character. But more than all,
it means conserving the things we now
have.
The optimist says there is coal
enough to last thousands of years. So
he said of the lumber in Michigan and
Wisconsin thirty years ago. So he
said of the wild pigeons in Michigan
and the buffaloes on the plains. We
who listen to the optimist who so
speaks, listen to the siren. The eng-
ineer is a man of deeds, not a dream-
er. He deals in real things, not phan-
toms. He, better than almost anyone
else, can judge of the things necessary
to the physical structure of our insti-
tutions. I said physical structure. Per-
haps I was too modest, and should
have included mental structures as
well. Let me explain:
The work which is now, and in the
future must be the engineer's, cannot
be done at all without the support of
his neighbor in other walks of life. To
win his support, he must make his
neighbor understand. Thus the engi-
neer must become a teacher, an apostle,
if you like, to preach the gospel of un-
derstanding to those who do not now
realize the condition of things. In the
&gt;CIE


20
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
past we have all been too busy to do
more than make a living for ourselves
and a fortune perhaps for someone
else. We must continue the first, but
the second becomes a new problem.
Fortunes will still be made, but if we
can read the handwriting on the wall,
they will become fewer and farther be-
tween in the years to come.
The conditions of the times are well
represented by the quarrels between
capital and labor, between the public
service corporation and the public,
which are now foremost in our atten-
tion. The men in control of each
and all of these great forces must be
made to understand the facts and prin-
ciples upon which their respective de-
mands are based, and how far they
can reasonably expect to have them
satisfied. For example, railroad em-
ployees must be made to realize, that,
omitting taxes and depreciation, one-
half or more of the total operating ex-
pense goes to them in wages. Thus if
there is a ten per cent increase in
wages, there is a five per cent increase
in operating expenses. Thus, much less
is available for taxes, depreciation and
support of the investment.
The State and Federal Commissions
should be made to understand that
there is a limit below which operative
earnings cannot go if the demands of
labor are to be met with increasing
frequency and the property is to be
maintained always in condition to ren-
der the service required. Where the
two lines, the decrease of earnings on
the one hand and the increase of ex-
penses on the other, cross, or soon aft-
er, there must be a crash. To use a
hydraulic term, there will no longer
be any difference of head to turn the
wheels.
The Public Service Commission
stands for the people, the public. It
is a splendid controlling force. Its
motives are not to be impugned. But
it needs the kind of information which
engineers can furnish. Congress has
made the acquirement of some of this
information possible. The valuation
of railroads by a federal board has
been in progress now for some time.
It is a stupendous task in its details,
and still more stupendous in its pos-
sibilities of application.
It behooves the engineers intrusted
with the work to see that it is well
done, and all done. It will require
great stamina and strength of charact-
er and rare judgment to produce the
true results. It, however, is one thing
to produce the results and another
thing to have them believed. The eng-
ineering profession is large, therefore
has a direct interest in the conduct of
the work and its welfare. The pro-
fession should not stand aloof, but
should interest itself now at the be-
ginning and until the last figure is
made.
Then will come the application of
the results by the Interstate Commerce
Commission to the problems of capital
and rates to be allowed. Here again
the engineer will have a work to do,
a teaching work. What are the ele-
ments of cost that shall be considered
proper for capital, and what factor
shall make up the allowance out of
earnings for operating expenses and
maintenance of the property in a con-
dition to render safely at all times the
service demanded? These are new
fields for most engineers, and before
we can become teachers, we must be-
come students.
As engineers we have so closely con-
fined our attention to the details of
our work as not to see very far be-
yond. It is perhaps natural enough
that we have done so, for engineers
while students in college usually have


ENGINEERING IN A BROADER ASPECT
21
a distinct purpose in mind, and bend
all their energies to its accomplish-
ment. They are not, as a rule, sons
of wealth, and there is the necessity
of becoming earners as soon as pos-
sible after graduation. Then, to create
something, to advance a particular art,
to produce necessities at a lower cost,
to occupy a new field, or effect im-
provement in an old field, are all at-
tractive things because they are con-
crete and their accomplishment marks
an epoch in one's life.
The engineer is peculiarly a modest
man, almost a careless man, in the
matter of personal wealth, and is con-
tent to work for others to their gain
rather than to his own. By this I do
not mean that he lacks independence
or self-reliance; far from it, for what
man has more of these qualities than
the surveyors who as pioneers blazed
the trail for those who followed? Who
would not lift his hat in salute to the
men who have spanned our great riv-
ers with those masterpieces of struc-
tural engineering, the great bridges
of the world, and those who have tun-
neled under them? What engineer is
more in the eye of the world today
than the builder of the Panama Canal?
Our railroads, our ocean steamships,
and the vast concourse of achieve-
ments, all are witnesses to the inde-
pendence and self-reliance of the eng-
ineer.
It may be, and probably is, due in
large measure to the engineer's ability
to center himself on specific things
that the world has advanced so far in
a multitude of directions. Look at
the galaxy of names in the textile arts.
John Kay, inventor of the fly shuttle;
Richard Arkwright, inventor of the
drawing rollers and founder of the
present factory system; Samuel
Crompton, inventor of the mule; Ed-
mund Cartwright, inventor of the
power loom and of improvements in
cotton spinning; and Joseph Marie
Jacquard, Richard Roberts and Joshua
Heilman. In other lines there are
James Watt, John Smeaton, Robert
Fulton, George and Robert Stephen-
son; and still others, many of them,
all examples of men who have by their
persistence and abilities in particular
lines brought great things to pass in
the world. We must still have our in-
ventors, men content to devote a life-
time to the accomplishment of a single
thing, our specialists, as they are now
called, in the various fields.
But engineering has widened its
scope beyond the capacity of individ-
uals. With this expansion there has
grown the need for men trained in a
broader way, not alone in engineering,
but in other walks of life. The simple
life of our forefathers no longer ex-
ists, or is possible . Our horizon is
now far away, and in between there is
so much of the machinery of life, that
we need perspective to see it all in
proper proportion. We need the sight
that can be had only by separating
one's self from the thick of things, the
sight from the hilltop, as it were.
We need men who have the capacity
to command. A general or an admiral
fights his battles, not by mingling with
his troops or sailors, but by directing
operations from some point apart from
the firing line. In the same way we
need today engineers with vision to
see the disposition of the various
forces under his control which in co-
operation make possible our complex
modern civilization. If we are to ob-
tain the best results in the future it
must be from a broader view of engi-
neering than has been necessary in the
past.
Perhaps I can make my meaning
clear in no better way than by refer-
ring to a subject of paramount impor-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
tance at the present time, namely, our
public utilities and the attitude of the
public towards them. Among the
many that might be mentioned are
steam and electric railroads, express
companies, telegraph and telephones,
water-works, electric light and power
plants, gas works, and central heating
plants. These are in the main owned
and operated by companies known as
public service corporations. Some
utilities, water-works for instance, in
earlier days privately owned, are now
for the most part owned and operated
by municipalities. A considerable part
of the express business is now handled
by the government under its parcel
post system. Mail matter was at one
time carried by private post. The
trend is more and more toward public
ownership of all utilities.
The question must frequently arise
in the future, whether it will, or will
not, be wise to go to public ownership.
There will be those who favor it and
those who oppose it. Somebody should
be able to give the true answer. The
engineer is naturally the man. His
training fits him particularly for the
necessary analysis of the problem, and
upon his judgment the public must, or
ought, to rely. Why have I qualified
by using the word "ought"? Because
in every community there are certain
citizens who aspire to leadership and
leave no stone unturned to accom-
plish their purpose. All too often, the
settlement of vexatious municipal
problems has been made practically
impossible by the attitude of self-ap-
pointed reformers. Some of them, it
must be said, have only good motives,
but others have only selfish motives.
In numerous instances a settlement of
comparatively simple matters has been
deferred for years, or until the pati-
ence of the people was exhausted; aft-
er which a speedy adjustment has
been accomplished by leaving the mat-
ter to the engineers.
The newspapers could, if they
would, aid greatly in helping solve the
delicate questions before the country
by undertaking to educate the people
on the fundamental questions involv-
ed, giving space to both sides in con-
troversy, and writing in sane language.
Some of them aim to do that, but not
all. For example, there appeared re-
cently in an evening paper, referring
to a public service corporation the fol-
lowing :—
"It is a close-fisted, grasping, decep-
tive concern, brow-beating when it
can, fawning when bulldozing fails,
and knuckling down when properly
called."
And the following morning another
paper in its leading editorial headed
"The Biennial Shamfight Opens,"

have been worrying over the prospect
that we might have to go through a
municipal campaign here this year

begin to sleep nights again. The cam-
paign is shaping up very nicely and
the issue is all right. The Mayor's
good friends .... have seen to it

is willing to sell and is ready to talk

to form about the open mouths of our
gifted spouters, and they are declaim-
ing vehemently that the 'utility' must
go. B-r-r! Berludd! Fee, Fo, Fum!"
And the utility replies:
"If it has committed any offenses
against the laws there have been fre-
quent opportunities to expose these
wrongs before grand juries, even as
late as a few months ago when the
newspaper's representative was sum-

moned as a witness." And so it goes,
dragging out the weary tale year after
year. Where does it all get to? No-
where, so far as the public is concern-
ed. In the end, if the issue does not
die a natural death, it may get into
the hands of a board of engineers, and
if the disgust of the citizens be great
enough, the problem will be left to the
engineers to settle.
The conditions as between the pub-
lic and the public service corporation
have now become so serious as to in-
volve more than individuals. There
is a widespread belief that the public
corporation has not been dealing fair-
ly, that it needs curbing, that it has
been making unholy gains,—in short,
has been robbing the people. This
may have been true in the past, and
probably was in some cases; indeed it
may still be true, but nowhere nearly
to the same extent. The corporation
officer is .willing to admit the blame
for having roused the wrath of the
public. He should have seen the
storm clouds sooner, and shortened
sail before being cast on his beam
ends. The public service corporation
has for many years been sailing close
to a lee shore, and has not taken
soundings of public opinion, or noted
the light-houses marking the reefs.
The mistake is now recognized, and
the attitude of the utilities is for peace
on favorable terms. The public says,
peace on our terms. There is in the
ultimatum a note of revenge—a war
cry in some sections of the country—
and there the public service corpora-
tions are fighting for life. Right here
the danger lies. The pendulum is
likely to swing back too far, and in
revenging itself the public is liable to
cripple itself. That must be guarded
against.
Another matter which we must all
deplore is the practice in this country
of discounting the testimony of wit-
nesses in hearing before commissions
and courts; that is, the apparent ne-
cessity of having several engineers
testify to the same set of facts. In
England and in Canada, I believe, one
engineer who has shown by his qual-
ifications that he is competent to test-
ify, is considered enough. But here,
notwithstanding the array of engineer-
ing talent brought into court, the issue
seems still to remain in doubt. This
is particularly true in hearing before
commissions relating to public service
properties. The reasons appear to be
that so far as the public is concerned
the case has been prejudiced, and no
amount of controverting testimony
can effect a change. Then, too, there
is the feeling that engineers whose
testimony is favorable to the corpor-
ation have been bought.
I doubt if we as engineers have giv-
en much thought to this phase of our
own relation to the public. It is a
splendid tribute to the profession that
the greatest projects in the world,
those involving millions upon millions
of dollars, have been entrusted to engi-
neers without even requiring bonds for
the faithful performance of duty. It
is a glory closely akin to that per-
taining to the officers of our army and
navy, the motives of not one of whom
would for a single moment be ques-
tioned. Yet, the engineer when he ap-
pears for the public service corpora-
tion is considered to wear a collar on
his neck and to be led with a chain.
Recognizing this attitude of the
public some of the so-called experts in
public utility matters,—and there are
few I am happy to say,—give as an
argument for their employment by the
public that they have never worked
for corporations, that they accept em-
ployment only in the interests of the
public. As bearing on this I may


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
quote a remark of the late Judge Tay-
lor of the United States Court in the
hearing of the Cleveland City street
railroad case a few years ago. A dis-
tinguished engineer from New York
City was testifying, and the late Tom
Johnson, then Mayor of Cleveland,
was conducting the cross-examination.
In an effort to belittle the testimony
of the engineer Mr. Johnson asked him
if he had not worked for corporations,
if he was not then in fact employed
by corporations. Judge Taylor inter-
rupted and said, "That will do along
that line, Mr. Johnson. I consider
that no man is qualified to testify on
the subject under investigation who
has not built electric railroads, and to
have been engaged in that work one
must have worked for corporations.
Railroads are built by corporations."
It behooves us, then, as engineers so
to regulate our conduct that the peo-
ple will have confidence in us. The
engineer's capital is his reputation.
He must not depreciate or destroy it.
He cannot afford that for his own
sake, still less for his country's sake.
He must stand ready to serve the peo-
ple at this, a critical stage in our his-
tory as a nation j with a loyalty com-
manding the respect and confidence
of everyone. To do this most effec-
tively he must in addition to whatever
specialty he may have in mind to de-
vote himself to, rise above it and view
his profession of engineering in a
broader aspect. He must recognize
that his duty as a citizen is even more
important than as a specialist, and
stand ready at all times to aid in the
solution of public questions for which
his training has so well fitted him.
Another field of endeavor which it
seems to me the engineer must soon
enter is the adjustment of the relations
between labor and capital. I do not
pretend to discuss it, nor do I intend
to question the motives of either party
to the frequent controversies between
capital and labor. But this much I
may say:—that it is of vital interest
to our welfare as a nation, and many
of the problems have to deal with mat-
ters of which the engineer has most in-
timate knowledge. The labor ques-
tion appears rapidly to be coming into
politics, a fact which must greatly in-
terest the student of history reminding
him as it must of legislative acts relat-
ing to labor during the decline of the
Roman Empire. Would it not be well
for us all, labor leaders, legislators,
citizens, to devote a little more time
to our history? Might we not be quite
as well off in our schools if we should
check our impetuous rush towards
vocational subjects and give more time
to the things good for us as a people—
as the whole people?


Molecular Velocities
PROFESSOR GEORGE W. PATTERSON
The student of engineering is con-
stantly brushing shoulders with inter-
esting phenomena, but seldom does he
pause to make their acquaintance. He
is, as a rule, interested in their bearing
on engineering, and not in them, for
themselves. To me there is nothing
more interesting than to try to pry into
the family secrets of the molecule.
Years ago we were taught that the
molecule was built up of so-called
atoms, the latter representing the
smallest existing parts of the various
so-called elements. It has of late years
been the fashion to question the actual
existence of elements and atoms, but
the molecule still seems to exist, and
the electric ion has been added to it.
When a substance is hot, we explain
the heat as a mode of motion of the
molecules. In the case of a solid the
molecules seem to be bobbing about
like boats at anchor in rough water;
in liquids the molecules bob about and
drift, but in gases the molecules are
freest of all, for they have free paths
long in comparison with the dimension
of the molecules. When two mole-
cules collide and bound apart again,
we can see that changes in motion
must take place. If we assume each
molecule before the collision to have
a straight-line motion exclusively, ro-
tational and vibratory motions being
absent, it will at once be seen that
afterwards all three forms of motion
will probably be present. Just how
the energy of these three forms of
motion is divided no one can say, but
it is reasonable to assume that for a
nonatomic gas the energy of the linear
motion is larger in comparison with
the others. In the diatomic gases such
as oxygen, hydrogen or nitrogen, the
molecule is larger in its dimensions
and we can see a better chance for
vibrations inside the molecule and for
rotational energy, because the moment
of inertia must be larger for a system
of two atoms in comparison with that
of the single atom of the nonatomic
gas. The more complicated the atom
the greater the part of the energy of
these internal motions and the smaller
the part due to linear velocity. This
is proved when we measure the pres-
sure of the gas caused by the rebound
of the molecules on the side of the
retaining vessel; for the pressure en-
ables us to determine the effective
velocity (square root of mean square
value) and the specific heat of the gas
enables us to find the energy of all the
motion.
To illustrate this point, let us con-
sider a cubic centimeter of air al
standard temperature and pressure
(O° C and 76 cm. height of barom-
eter). Let the average square of the
velocity of the molecules be V2, and
the components of V be V», Vy, and
V,. It is evident that V*=V\+V*r+
V'-z, and that on the average the three
components will be equal; therefore,
on the average VX2=^V2. If the den-
sity of the gas is d and the pressure p,
it is evident from Newton's second
law of motion that the average re-
bound of the molecules reversive to the
normal components of the velocity will
3P
give the relation: p=i/3dV2=—. For
d
air under standard conditions this
(25)


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
'•
gives V=4&amp;4.7 meters per second. If
this was the only motion of the mole-
cules the energy would be some 117.5
joules per gram for air at o° C. From
determinations of the specific heat of
air we find the energy to be some 191.3
joules or 63% more. From this we
conclude that the concealed motions of
the molecule (probably rotational and
vibratory) are responsible for this
part of the energy. Reduced to per-
centage basis of the whole energy, we
compute 61.3% of the energy due to
motion translation and 38.7% due to
rotation and vibrations. It is reason-
able to believe that at times part of
the energy changes from kinetic to
potential and vice versa. We could
not otherwise explain the phenomena
of the collisions and vibrations, if
present. The percentages given above
are so called statistical averages, for
the motion of the individual molecules
will change from time to time. A
head-on collision of two molecules will
result very differently from a side-
swiping collision, and it is to be con-
cluded, therefore, that the molecules
in collision give and receive energy
and rearrange its form. All we can
know is that neither energy nor mo-
mentum are gained or lost to the two
molecules in collision. If one mole-
cule should happen to have any mo-
tion more pronounced than the aver-
age, it would not be long before other
molecules colliding with it would rob
it of its excess, and therefore the sta-
tistical average must differ but little
from the velocity of individual mole-
cules. The average value of V is of
course less than the effective value,
for the average square is always
greater than the square of the average
value. In arriving at the value of the
effective velocity of the molecule no
allowance is made in the formula
3P
V2 = — for time lost or path saved
d
by the collisions. The number of
times that a molecule is supposed to
rebound on the walls of the enclosure
is compiled from the average velocity
and distance from wall to wall, all
possible paths being considered. At
higher temperatures, if the pressure
remains constant, expansion takes
place and the gas becomes rarer, thus
reducing the collisions, and under
these circumstances the formula needs
little correction; on the other hand, at
lower temperatures the molecules are
more crowded and collisions become
more frequent, thus reducing the aver-
age length of the free path. It is evi-
dent that on collision the molecules
will (on the average) exchange the
components of their radical velocities,
thus passing on the motion without
having to cover the whole distance,
and thus saving some time to offset
the time lost in the collision. How
accurately the gain offsets the loss it
is difficult to estimate. Maxwell, in a
paper on the kinetic theory of heat,
has a very interesting discussion of
this subject, and later authors have
written much bearing on this matter.
If we knew the answer we would
have considerable data from which to
estimate the size of the molecules.
One of the very interesting phases
of the subject is the relation between
the effective velocity of the molecules
and the velocity with which sound
waves are transmitted through gases.
In air, for example, we find sound
waves to be propagated with a velocity
of about 332 meters per second, while
the effective value of the velocity of
the molecule is about 485 meters per
second. If the average value of


square of any component of the
velocity of the molecule is one-third
of the square of the whole velocity,
giving V* = 0.57735V, we might ex-
pect V to be the velocity of sound.
But if V is 485 meters per second we
shall find V* to be only 280, which is
much too small for the velocity of
sound in air. It has been found that
if this value is multiplied by the
square root of the ratio Y of the spe-
cific heats at constant pressure and at
constant volume, we shall add about
19% and get the observed value for
the velocity of sound. Treating a gas
as a continuous elastic medium (which
it is not), the velocity of sound is com-
puted as VVy/3-
Light weight molecules like those of
hydrogen must have higher velocities
than those of heavier molecules like
those of oxygen in order that
may produce equal pressures.
they
We
therefore conclude that a similar rela-
tion will hold for the velocity with
which they transmit sound. If an
oxygen molecule is, say, sixteen times
as heavy as one of hydrogen, we
should expect four times as much
velocity in the hydrogen. In fact,
hydrogen transmits sound four times
as fast as oxygen.
There are many other interesting
aspects of the molecule—e. g., how
they radiate heat and light, and their
relation to electro-magnetic action, and
about these there has been much spec-
ulation. I hope that some time we
shall know much more about them.
Meanwhile, we know enough to make
the family secrets of the molecule of
interest.


GEORGE G. BROWN
Every man who has driven an au-
tomobile, whether a "Lizzy" four or a
Packard twelve, has noted at least
some of the following characteristics
peculiar to all internal combustion
engines; and practically every driver
has his own more or less original ex-
planation of the contributing causes.
Before considering the particular
factors affecting the behavior of a gas
engine under certain conditions, the
reader should have a fair conception
of the mechanical and chemical chang-
es taking place in the gas engine cycle.
The gasoline engine operates on the
Otto cycle which may be represented
ideally on the Pressure Volume Dia-
gram as in ligure 1.

The hydrocarbon fuel in the form
of a vapor air mixture is drawn into
the cylinder along the path o-1. The
charge is then compressed adiabatic-
ally, i.e., no heat added or removed,
along the path 1-2 and exploded or
burned at constant volume 2-3 giving
up its heat of combustion (Qa) to the
products of combustion which then be-
come the working substances instead
of the vapor air mixture as previously.
The power stroke (adiabatic ex-
pansion) is represented by the path
3-4, and the exhaust by the 4-1-0,
whereby heat Qr is rejected, i.e., ab-
sorbed by the atmosphere, along the
path 4-1. This completes the cycle
in which the heat Q=Q»—Qr has
been transformed into work repre-
sented by the area 1-2-3-4.
The combustion of hydrocarbons
under even the simplest conditions is
a complicated reaction which is gen-
erally held to follow these reactions
for methane,
CH4-»CH3OH^CH, (OH),
H2O+H2CO
&gt;CHOOH-»CO(OH),
which make clear that water is the first
end product formed and that carbon
monoxide (CO) is formed before car-
bon dioxide (CO2).
At the temperatures of ignition and
combustion of a gasoline vapor and air
mixture, thermal decomposition or
"cracking'' of the vapor phase takes
place in a number of ways, depend-
ing upon the temperature, pressure,
and other conditions, one product of
which may be carbon. This action is
particularly noticeable in the carbon
deposited upon the walls of the cylin-
ders, especially when burning a "rich"
mixture.
There are then these two reactions
taking place simultaneously in the
cylinder as the mixture is exploded:
combustion producing heat and work,
and decomposition of the gasoline gen-
erally absorbing heat and depositing
carbon. Combustion is desired rather
than decomposition and if the speed
of the combustion relative to decom-
position is in any way increased, ther-
(28)


29
mal decomposition is to that extent
retarded.
Ignition
An explosive mixture must be
brought to a certain thermal (or ther-
mo-electrical) condition before the
rate of combination of its reactive con-
stituents is sufficient to cause the
chemical change to become autogen-
ous, i.e., self propellant. As soon as
the rate of combination becomes such
that the mixture "heats itself" its tem-
perature will very rapidly rise to the
point at which a flame appears. The
ignition temperature of a given ex-
plosive mixture may be denned as that
degree to which it must be raised, at
least locally, to make the chemical ac-
tion autogenous. The real ignition
point so denned is not necessarily
synchronous with the actual appear-
ance of flame; there usually is an ap-
preciable "pre-flame period" which is
negligible only in the fastest burning
mixtures.
Explosion
Explosions may be divided into two
classes:
(1.) A uniform rate of flame pro-
pagation with a velocity of not more
than about fifteen (15) feet per sec-
ond.
(2.) A detonating wave rapidly
accelerating to a high velocity which
in some cases exceeds ten thousand
(10,000) feet per second. A mixture
of eights parts hydrogen to one of
oxygen (by volume) gives a detonat-
ing wave with a velocity of 11,580
feet per second.
Professor Lucke at Columbia has
published some photographs of flame
travel in glass tubes which show the
rate of combustion at first uniform
and slow but rapidly accelerating to a
high constant volume. Fieurc two is
a copy from one of these photographs.
In gasoline engines very rarely if
ever does the detonating wave develop
even if the mixture proportions are
suitable. In the present discussion,
then, "explosion" will refer to the
flame propagation of uniform veloc-
ity.
The rate of explosion depends pri-
marily upon conditions of tempera-
ture or pressure (which have a sim-
ilar effect) and mixture proportions.
The rate of explosion of the detonat-

ing mixture, four volumes of methane
to three volumes of oxygen (sufficient
to form water and carbon monoxide)
greatly exceeds that of the proper
mixture for complete combustion (one
volume of methane to two volumes
of oxygen). This is to be expected,
for, as shown above the primary ox-
idation products are water (H2O) and
carbon monoxide (CO), the extra
oxygen being absolutely inert in the
flame wave acts as a retarder to flame
propagation and combines only slowly
with the carbon monoxide to form
carbon dioxide.

'Figure three indicates the velocity
of explosion of gasoline air mixtures
of varying composition. As *, (the
pounds of air per pound of gasoline),
decreases from 34.8-29 C (the value
for maximum velocity of flame when
C is the percentage of carbon in the
fuel), combustion becomes less com-
plete. Under these conditions ther-
mal decomposition increases with de-
position of carbon. As * increases to

34.8-23.2 C, combustion becomes more
complete; but with further increases
of 4&gt; the velocity of explosion be-
comes so low that some of the gases are
driven out of the cylinder before they
are burned. As the mixture becomes
still leaner, explosion becomes so slow
that the engine completes two strokes
or one half cycle before combustion
is finished. The intake valve is open-
ed while some of the mixture from the
previous charge is still burning in the
cylinder, causing an explosion in the
intake manifold which is known as
"backfiring".
After Burning
"After burning" is the term used to
denote this combustion of carbon mon-
oxide to carbon dioxide which takes
place after the explosion proper.
The equilibrium
2CCH O,=2CO,+heat
has been thoroughly investigated at
different temperatures and is repre-
sented graphically in figure four, taking
CO2 + CO as 100%.
When a gasoline air mixture is ex-
ploded water and carbon monoxide
are formed. The carbon monoxide
will then unite with whatever oxygen
may be present to form carbon dioxide
to the extent indicated on the equi-
librium diagram above. But as the
temperatures developed momentarily
by the flame are usually well above
1800° F., and the equilibrium above
this temperature shows practically no
carbon dioxide, this action is further
delayed and occurs only as the charge
becomes cooled by the water jacket
and expansion process, thereby tend-
ing to maintain the temperature during
expansion.
The Effect of Moisture
That the presence of a sufficient
amount of moisture in the cylinder
aids combustion is a fact which has
been observed at some time by nearly
every driver, either by driving on
damp evenings when the moisture is
being precipitated out of the air by
the lowering temperature, or by using
some kind of a "steam carburetor."
It has long been known that moist
carbon dioxide has a lower ignition
point than when dry. This fact,
among others, leads to the conclusion
that moisture accelerates the reaction
between carbon monoxide and oxygen
to form carbon dioxide. Then the
presence of moisture would increase


the rate of liberating heat, which in-
creases the temperature, which in-
creases the pressure developed in the
cylinder. And as the power developed
is directly proportional to the pressure,
the presence of moisture is then di-
rectly responsible for increased power
output.
But as moisture or water is the first
end product formed when gasoline
and air is exploded, why should it be
necessary to add any more water, as
the gas in the cylinder is normally
about saturated? This might be par-
tially explained by means of the solu-
bility of carbon dioxide in water, in
that the water, if present in the liquid
phase, absorbs the carbon dioxide as
it is formed, thus removing it from
the vapor phase and decreasing the
concentration of carbon dioxide in the
vapor phase. But as carbon dioxide
and carbon monoxide are in equilib-
rium in the vapor phase, this removal
of carbon dioxide upsets the equilib-
rium and more carbon monoxide unites
with oxygen to form carbon dioxide,
thus reestablishing the equilibrium. If
this explanation is correct, moisture
must be present in the liquid state in
order to have any effect upon the equi-
librium, otherwise the carbon dioxide
would not be removed from the vapor
phase. One method of having water
present in the liquid state is to super-
saturate the mixture at the temper-
ature and pressure of explosion.
Efficiency
The efficiency of a gas engine b
dependent upon two factors that can
be controled by carburetion:
(1) The amount of the total heat
of the fuel that is utilized:
(2) The ratio between the specific
CP
heats of the working substance,
Cr
which is a gasoline air mixture before
combustion and consists of the prod-
ucts of combustion thereafter.
It is obvious that it is impossible to
attain efficiency if unburned gases are
passing out the exhaust manifold.
Then the mixture must contain suf-
ficient oxygen to support complete
combustion of the fuel, but not so
much excess air that the rate of ex-
plosion is so low that some of the gases
are passing out the exhaust before they
are completely burned.
The thermodynamic expression for
the efficiency of the Otto cycle is
I
i where r is the compression
r(i-k)
Vi Cp
ratio and k is . The value of
V2 CV
r is fixed by the design of the engine,
but k is directly influenced by the
composition of the mixture or charge.
By an inspection of the equation it is
evident that high values for k make
for high efficiency. Following is a
table giving the values of k for the
different constituents of the working
substance:
k
Oxygen j A}r
Nitrogen J
Carbon monoxide 1.41
Carbon dioxide 1.31
Water vapor 1.12 (about)
Gasolene vapor, less than for water
vapor.
As carbon monoxide differs very
slightly from air and is ruled out
by the consideration of complete com-
bustion, the other four constituents
only need be considered—i. e.. air and
gasoline vapor during compression, and
air, water vapor and carbon dioxide
during expansion. Air has a greater


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
1
value for k than any of the other con-
stituents, and theoretically as well as
practically high efficiency calls for
lean mixtures—i. e., mixtures with an
excess of air, limited only by incom-
plete combustion caused by the de-
creasing rate of explosion as men-
tioned above.
Power
If the speed of an engine is constant
the power output varies as the torque,
which is directly proportional to the
increase in pressure (P3-P.,) devel-
oped by the explosion. If, then, that
P,-Pr
P2 fQ-|-1760 *-f-40800 C—61200-
and as * can be varied only from that
amount necessary to form water and
carbon monoxide to the amount neces-
sary for complete combustion, it fol-
lows that maximum pressure and
power will be developed when all the
carbon is burned to carbon monoxide,
as occurs with rich mixtures.
(Note.—As this equation represents
a hyperbola with asymptotes parallel
to the axes, it cannot be solved for
maximum value in the usual way.
However, by inserting the values for
specific heats as given above, the equa-
tion takes the following form:
*=34.8—23.2C
.3025*—2.015C+1.97
mixture can be determined that gives
the maximum increase in pressure, the
same mixture must of necessity give
the maximum power output.
The following equation represents
the pressure increase due to explosion
of a mixture containing * parts of
air to one of gasoline (by weight),
when Q is the heat of combustion and
C the percent of carbon in the fuel,
and * varies between the limits 34.8.
29C and 34.8-23.2C:
*=34.8—29C
which is nearly a straight line. Then
the mixture giving maximum power is
the same as that giving maximum rate
of explosion.
Influence of Temperature
The most important effect of tem-
perature is to increase the rate of ex-
plosion as indicated in figure four and
to widen the limits of explosive mix-
tures. Thus, we find that at higher
temperatures maximum economy oc-
curs with leaner mixtures because the

The mean specific heats at constant
volume (Cv) through the temperature
range T._ to T, are, to the best of our
present knowledge, about as follows:
Carbon dioxide 34
Water vapor 68
Carbon monoxide 238
Nitrogen 238
Oxygen 21
From the equation above wc can see
by insp-ction that low specific heat?
mean a greater increase in pressure.
rate of explosion is greater and the
leaner mixture will burn completely
before the exhaust valve opens. Not
only do we find the maximum econ-
omy with leaner mixtures, but wc get
a greater maximum with increased
temperatures because we are enabled
to bum completely a mixture with a
higher value for k.
The effect of increased temperatures
upon power is twofold.
(1) Decreases the pressure devel-


33

oped by decreasing the volumetric effi-
ciency—i. e., decreasing the weight of
charge drawn into the cylinder, al-
though the volume is the same. This
is indicated in the above equation by
T
i2-
(2) By increasing the rate of ex-
plosion, the composition of the mix-
ture giving maximum power covers a
wider range.
The Ideal Carburetor
The ideal carburetor must respond
automatically to varying conditions
put upon the engine so as to deliver
at all times without compromise the
optimum mixture of gasoline vapor
and aii». Before this can be done,
some carbureting or mixing device
must be available by which the mix-
ture proportions can be made to vary
automatically as desired with changing,
conditions of temperature and engine
load. Only then will it be possible to
run a motor car at maximum efficiency
and attain maximum power when
needed.

EDITORIAL
To be a teacher is to enjoy rewards found only in true
Outside service. Rewards never come without responsibilities and
Work sacrifices. Teachers in our state universities shoulder great
responsibilities and often make sacrifices to enable them
to continue in their chosen profession. The teacher is responsible to the
nation, to the state, and directly to the student. In giving his best efforts to
the student he scnres both state and nation.
Due to conditions beyond the control of the teacher, he often finds it
impossible to give his entire time to the student. He realizes that he is
not serving the student to the best of his ability, and he regrets that it
should be so. Can he be blamed? Perhaps he should take no outside work
His family, however, must be considered. The income from his teaching
would, scarcely provide the necessities of life.
This problem, a most vital one to the student in a technical school, has
only one satisfactory solution. No outside practice can be allowed This

rule, rigidly enforced, will have immediate and beneficial results. Fewer
full time men will be required to do the work now done by part time men.
The income of each remaining teacher can thus be increased. Only men
having a true love of teaching will be attracted to fill teaching positions.
This is what we want. Our people are coming to realize the importance of
teachers to our national welfare, and in the future no man, when he is
chosen to teach, will have to sacrifice.
To be best fitted for practical work on graduation, a stu-
A Neglected dent should have at least some training along the lines of
Opportunity commercial practice in his branch of engineering work. A
means for giving the student practical experience while he
is in school would be worth while, not only for its own sake, but also for
the added value that it would give his theoretical work. Theories shown
to actually work out in practice are more easily remembered and fully
understood.
Civil engineers are given a required course which approximates prac-
tical work. At Camp Davis, facilities are available for each student to do
different kinds of surveying work. Conditions are not always ideal, as he
would find in practice. To overcome the difficulties often requires ingenuity
and headwork, qualities which are necessary to the successful engineer.
Should not students in other branches of engineering work be able to
get some practical experience along their lines? Some technical schools
send their electrical engineers, as part of the required work, to various
large electrical manufacturing houses: The students spend a certain
length of time with the firm, during which time they are under the instruc-
tion of a faculty man from their school. The value of the experience gained
and the friendships made can not be expressed in any monetary system.
Mechanical engineers, especially those specializing in production work,
could easily be farmed out to some of the large automobile plants for prac-
tical experience. A practical experience course added to the curriculum of
all our engineering students would certainly insure the graduation of better
engineers.
Classification, while only a technical detail in the machinery
Early of a large school, is yet to the student: a very important
Classification procedure. The success of his semester's work depends in
no small degree on the arangement of his courses and his
choice of instructors.
In a large school classification is liable to develop into a complicated
and bunglesome process. This year, for the first time in the Engineering
College, means have been taken to ease the usual classification rush by spread-
ing classification over a longer period. Some time before the end of the
semester we were asked to hand in to our classifiers elections for the coming
semester. Tentative schedules were made out by the classifiers, but no
final classification was done until between semesters. Very often the classi-
fier's work was entirely satisfactory to the student. In this case, his classi-

/ NGINLTRING • SOCIETY

MBER l92l


fication was really done weeks before. Sometimes the student and classifier
failed to agree on hours or instructors. The whole matter had to be arranged
to suit both parties, taking considerable time. The classifier's time in making
out the original tentative schedule was wasted. Could not the student and
classifier, working together, make out schedules before the end of a semes-
ter? Special announcements could be printed long in advance of the usinl
time of publication and all schedules could be satisfactorily arranged. In
this way the classification day rush could be avoided.
For some unaccountable reason, human nature opposes
The many forces which really work for our well-being. Some
Bitter PHI of our earliest recollections center on youthful struggles
against the orthodox bed-time hour, seven-thirty. We can
vividly remember our agony when compelled to swallow some one of the
old-fashioned family remedies. Saturday was dreaded because of its soap-
and-water orgies. Sunday morning found us with various imaginary ail-
ments or voluminous excuses to dodge the weekly session for the culture
of our souls.
Work is the means by which all life is sustained. To be busy is to be
happy. Men in all kinds of work and of all ages, although many of them
fail to realize it, are utterly dependent on their one little job for their hap-
piness,
Our present job is going to school. Does it have any serious meaning
to us? Is college a place to stall and dodge responsibilities, cr is it a place
for honest endeavor and work? Let's swallow the bitter pill. Very few
of us have a true interest in the work we are taking. A course means noth-
ing to many of us but so many hours credit. A true interest in our work
can be acquired. It must be acquired if we wish to take anything worth
while away with us on graduation. A diploma may be either a symbol of
honest preparation or a piece of sheepskin. Which will yours be?
Perhaps "Dad'' was not so disappointed when he found that the Hop
was abolished.
An old student, writing the Dean after reading his article entitled "Suc-
cess" which appeared in the January issue, said:
"I was much interested in your article in the last TECHNJC. Please
say a word to that man who is fifty and who had an unfortunate character-
istic standing between him and success, that he was damned lucky to have
only one."
The Dean, commenting on this remark, said it gave him the first million-
dollar laugh he had had this year.
Is it consistent with the spirit of the Honor System to be requested to
sign a pledge at the end of an examination? We think that the man who
cheats under the Honor System would have no qualms about pledging his
word to the contrary.


37
We appreciate the work that has been done to lessen the trials and
tribulations of classification. Perhaps a humane method for giving out
our credits can also be devised.
The Honor System is being tried for the first time in some examina-
tions in the Literary School. It is our sincere hope that Michigan will, in
a short time, conduct all her examinations on that basis.
On our last visit to the Dean's office, we noticed a large number of
oriental rugs which seemed to be serving no special purpose. Have you
ever noticed how bare the floor is in the Engineering Society rooms?
If asked how we should know when the milhnium had arrived, we
would reply that this semester the Special Announcement came out on time.
Sign in Manton ('Michigan) restaurant: "Don't complain about our
coffee; you may be old and weak yourself some time."
An engineer who is not a member of the Engineering Society will be
among the small minority next year.

NEW METHOD OF CLASSIFICA-
TION ADOPTED
A new system of classification was tried
for this semester using the Mechanical
Engineers as the medium. Like all new
systems this one has its advantages and
disadvantages. In order to know defi-
nitely which have the greater number of
points in their favor a brief category of
the two systems has been gathered,
which tends to express the opinion of the
faculty and of the students.
From the students' viewpoint the two
systems seem to be about evenly balanced,
with a possibility of the old way being the
most preferred.
This new system takes from the student
the right he has previously had of select-
ing his own instructors and his own
classes. To him this is the biggest draw-
back of the system, for the personal selec-
tion has always enabled him to pick the
instructor he knows, which is a distinct
advantage for it gives him the benefit of
the previous experience he has had with
this instructor, and allows him to make
use of the knowledge of the peculiarities
and wishes of that individual instructor.
The privilege of selecting the time of
his classes is something that the student
has considered his own, and he objects to
having it taken from him.
Of course all have complained about the
old system and the timejt wasted and its
inefficiency, but still it did give the student
the privileges of selection that the new
takes away.
The faculty believe that the new system
will give better results from both a scholas-
tic and a time saving standpoint in that
it allows them to select the classes, and the
time, thus bringing their knowledge and
experience into use as to which class
should come in the morning or what sub-
jects should come in the same semester.
A "MICHIGAN" CODE OF ETHICS
During the last ten years, the question of
a Code of Ethics has been a very live sub-
ject in the leading engineering societies.
A glance at the Proceedings of the A.
S. M. E. for the past year and a half will
reveal the serious attitude which is taken
by that society toward the engineer's
ethics.
As early as 1912 a Code had been formu-
lated and adopted by the A. S. M. E.
This Code eventually came to be con-
sidered ineffective, it was too lengthy a
document. As a result of this sentiment,
a committee was appointed in October,
1919, for the purpose of preparing a "Short
Code of Ethics of Broad Scope." After
several months' study of professional codes
in general, the Committee drew up a Code
which embodied some fourteen points.

i (38)


39
Before presenting it to the Society it was
published in "Mechanical Engineering" for
criticism and suggestions by the members.
Dean Cooley was invited to start the dis-
cussion.
Various members of the Engine«ning|
Faculty were consulted by the Dean and
after fixing the fundamental principles, the
proposed Code was given to Professor
Scott of the Rhetoric Department for
"smoothing out."
The resulting "Michigan Code," let us
call it by that name, was opposed by the
Committee because of the negative form.
The "thou shall not" introduction was not
appealing. It resulted, however, in the
Code being re-written by the Committee
and the incorporation in it of several of
the points of the "Michigan Code." As
re-written the Code was submitted at the
Annual Meeting of the Society last De-
cember.
The "Michigan Code" is here printed in
full. It will be noted that the "Michigan
Code" embodies the idea of the Ten Com-
mandments for whatever force that may
have. Moreover the negative form makes
for shortness, the things which one may
not do can be told in few words as com-
pared with the things which one may do.
To be effective a Code must be enforced.
"Liberty is the self-enforced obedience to
self-recognized law." Engineers who re-
ceived their first lessons in this priceless
form of liberty at "Michigan" will doubt-
less welcome a brief reminder of the Code
of Ethics for which they stand and in the
negative form these principles will best
harmonize with those other principles of
self-denial which are found in the hearts
of "Michigan Engineers."
1. He shall not fail to recognize that
the first duty of an enginer is to be a useful
citizen, exemplifying in his character and
his practice the highest ideals of citizen-
ship and of loyalty to his country.
2. He shall not permit selfish considera-
tions to influence his professional conduct,
but shall ever recognize service to society
and the public as fundamental in promot-
ing the interests of the engineering profes-
3.' He shall not associate himself with
any questionable or illegitimate enterprise
and shall not countenance such association
by a fellow engineer, but shall endeavor
to prevent it, first by friendly counsel and,
that failing, by reporting the facts and cir-
cumstances to the proper authorities.
4. He shall not accept compensation,
pecuniary or otherwise, from more than
one interested party and shall not receive,
directly or indirectly, any royalty, gratuity,
or commission on any patented article or
process used in the work upon which he is
retained, without the knowledge and con-
sent of all interested parties.
5. He shall not undertake any en-
gineering work in which his judgment or
the character of his services might be in-
fluenced by his other connections or in-
terests, and he shall not allow his clients'
or employers' interests to suffer in any
way through his professional relations with
others.
6. He shall not knowingly compete with
a fellow-engineer in the matter of profes-
sional charges, or attempt to supplant him
after definite steps have been taken toward
his employment; and he shall not take
over the work of another consulting en-
gineer without first conferring with him
and becoming satisfied that ample reasons
exist for a change.
7. He shall not advertise in an undigni-
fied, sensational or misleading manner or
solicit work by dishonest or unseemly
methods; and he shall not countenance
sensational, exaggerated or unwarranted
statements about his own work in the
public press; but may publish to the tech-
nical world new inventions, processes, and
engineering projects and accomplishments
through the Engineering Societies and the
technical press in preference to the public
press.
8. He shall not misrepresent recognized
facts and well established theories in mak-
ing reports, or in testifying as an expert;
and he shall not confuse newly discovered
facts and newly evolved theories with
those that have been long accepted; and
he shall not jeopardize the good name of
the profession by public expression of


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
opinions as an engineer on subjects in
which he may not properly qualify as an
authority.
9. He shall not make public any in-
formation obtained from or through work
for a client or employer, nor shalMie at
any time make such use of it as will em-
barass the client or employer in whose
service it was obtained, but may use such
information as forming part of his pro-
fessional experience to guide him in his
own professional practice.
10. He shall not refuse to help his fel-
low-engineers, by exchange of general in-
formation and experience, by personal in-
terest in their welfare or by instruction
through engineering societies, schools of
applied science, and the technical press, or
through the public press under conditions
that will insure accuracy and guarantee
that such public instruction shall not mis-
lead.
THE R. O. T. C.
To prove that the Military Department is
not asleep, or not even dozing, seems to
be the policy of Maj. Arthur, for his de-
partment is continually growing and
getting more equipment. They now have
complete materiel for firing problems,
which includes, guns, telephones, plotting
board, range finders, range boards and all
the necessary plotting room and observa-
tion station equipment. This assures the
student taking the Coast Artillery course
of a complete knowledge of the materiel
and a fairly definite insight into their use.
So when he attends the summer camp at
Fort Monroe he will be able to get the
most benefit out of his six weeks period of
training.
About thirty men attended the Artillery
Camp last summer and though the number
was rather small compared to the other
colleges, Michigan's representation man-
aged to place in all the events held, and
to win a few of them.
This last semester showed an increase
in enrollment over the previous year, the
Coast Artillery having 159 and the Signal
Corps 50. The establishment of the new
infantry unit is now assured and as soon
as the officers arrive its course of instruc-
tion will commence.
A DEAN OF MEN APPOINTED
By action of the Board of Regents, Pres.
Burton recently appointed Prof. J. A.
Bursley as the new Dean of Men. Dean
Bursley, on taking office will become
Chairman of the Committee on Student
Affairs; Chairman of the Committee on
Student Publications; Member of the
Board of Governors of the Union, and
retains his position as Director of the Uni-
versity Housing Bureau.
Prof. Bursley will continue his connec-
tion with the College of Engineering as
Professor of Mechanical Engineering. The
duties of the Dean of Men have not yet
been decided upon but will be determined
by such circumstances as may arise.
However, he will represent the President
in affairs with the students.

Evaporator Laboratory
The work in this laboratory is being
continued along the broad lines which
have been previously outlined. This in-
cludes data on heat transmission, etc., in
•he horizontal and vertical tube evapora-
tor. Five men under the direction of
Prof. W. L. Badger are carrying on this
work the present semester. They are R. B.
Ball, W. R. Eraser, H. D. Grant, J. J.
Pfcirfer, and J. H. Waite.
Metallurgical Laboratory
C. P. Beath, II. W. Stark, and E. P.
Line, are working during the present
semester upon the etching of alloy steels.
The steels being studied include chrome-
nickel, nickel, silicon, and chrome-nickel-
molybdenum. The metallography of alloy
steels is in general rather unsatisfactory,
and these men are studying as many dif-
ferent methods of etching as possible, with
the idea of discovering a method which
will develop grain boundaries.
J. R. Gibhart and R. B. Shurts, are
working upon the subject of corrosion of
Duriron and some other alloys.
E. R. Johnson under the direction of
Prof. Upthegrove is studying the effect of
time and temperature variations upon car-
burization.
D. K. Merrielees has started a series of
tests upon weathering of steel. It is pro-
posed to continue these tests over the
period of a year, and ascertain the effect
of weathering upon the physical properties
of steel.
W. R. Fraser is studying the reasons
for the failure in electrically welded auto
wheel rims. This problem originated in
the plant of the Buick Motor Co., who
were having to scrap an excessive amount
of rims from this cause.
H. K. Herschman under the direction of
Prof. A. E. White, is studying equilibrium
conditions of time and temperature in the
mallcablizing of cast iron.
G. G. Brown, a new member of the
Chemical Engineering faculty, is conduct-
ing an investigation of the feasibility of
using aluminum sulphide instead of alumi-
num oxide as the electrolyte in the pro-
duction of metallic aluminum. Two
seniors, T. C. Anderson and J. M. Miller,
are carrying out this work.
General Research
Mr. Brown is also directing some work
in the development of an improved carbu-
retor for gasoline engines. The plan of
this carburetor is such that it will adjust
the mixture automatically to take care of
changing loads and temperatures. H. J.
Mack, S. T. Lowe, and A. A. Young are
working with Mr. Brown upon this prob-
lem.
Prof. A. H. White is directing the work
upon the possible commercial uses of
oxygen and upon the burning and proper-
ties of so-called natural rock cements. It
is believed that in the near future the price
of commercial oxygen will be materially
reduced and it is with this in view that
the present experiments are being carried
out. The aim in these experiments is to
study the feasibility of using oxygen in
connection with steam in order to produce
water gas by a continuous rather than an
intermittent process. B. H. Shirk is doing
this work.
A. W. Cowing is working on the natural
rock cements. Not much is known about
these cements except that it is possible to
burn them at about the same temperature
tint lime is burned.
Prof. E. IT. Leslie is directing the work
on motor fuels and lubricating oils. In
this connection, H. A. Johnson is studying
the effect of various catalysts in the decom-
position of heavy oils for gasoline manu-
facture.

Lee Van Horn and J. W. Kennedy are
studying the question of the addition of
catalysts to motor fuels with a view of
improving the combustion.
R. P. Dillon is working on the question
of the effects of various additions to lubri-
cating oils to increase their efficiency thru
changing surface tension, adhesiveness,
vscosity, etc.
CORROSION OF ECONOMIZER
TUBES
At the instigation of the Detroit Edison
Co., a long series of experiments was
started about a year ago with the view of
studying the causes and prevention of cor-
rosion of economizer tubes. This work
is being carried out by Profs. A. E. White
and W. P. Wood of the department of
Chemical Engineering.
It is readily appreciated that one of the
most important elements in a study of cor-
rosion is time, and anyone beginning an
exhaustive study of this subject must not
e.xpcct to get any conclusive results in a
week or a month. For this reason it is
not possible at this time to present any
ccr.clusions which are of value as a result
of these tests. The first tests which are
partially completed have as their only ob-
ject the assembling of data which may
indicD'e which of the commercial materials
such as wrought iron, open hearth steel,
etc., will resist corrosion the best under a
given set of conditions, and which rust-
proofing operation, such as galvanizing,
Parkerizing, etc., will resist corrosion in
the most satisfactory manner. The tests
are being made in three different waters:
distilled water, Detroit City water, and
Connors Creek water.
There are many factors in corrosion
which will have to be studied in particular.
Among these might be mentioned the
effect of the unevenness of the corroding
surface, the effect of dissolved oxygen and
other gases, and the effect of varying pres-
sures.
In conjunction with actual experimental
work a thorough survey of the literature
upon the subject of corrosion is being
made.
After following out the work upon the
lines suggested it is hoped that some defi-
nite recommendations with regard to
economizer construction will be possible.
TECHNICAL SERVICE
The Department of Industrial Research
has sent to several thousand manufacturers
throughout the state the following card:
The University of Michigan through
the Department of Industrial Research
calls to your attention its facilities for
furnishing technical literature that will aid
you in the solution of yrur problems.
Upon request through your local library,
or, in the absence of a local library, upon
direct request, technical books and periodi-
cals which are available for circulation will
be furnished for a period of two weeks
with time extension privileges, without
other charges than the payment of the
transportation. Bibliographies, abstracts,
technical digests, translations and photo-
stat prints will be furnished at a nominal
charge.
Address all correspondence about library
service either to the Librarian, University
of Michigan, or to this department.
SHORT COURSE IN HIGHWAY

The advanced Short Period Courses in
Highway Enginering and Highway Trans-
port at the University are proving very
successful and are attracting many high-
way engineers, contractors and men en-
gaged in highway transport from all parts
of the United States, in fact from outside
the States, as two engineers have been sent
from the Chinese Government to specialize
in highway transport.
In connection with these courses, the fully
equipped Highway Engineering and Auto-

Fellowships Awarded
Five fellowships have been awarded to
the following highway engineers and high-
way transport specialists by the board of
Regents of the University of Michigan.
Herschel C. Smith, from Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma, who received an A. B. in 1913
from Michigan, B. C. E. in 1915 and has
since held the position of Deputy Chief
Engineer of the Oklahoma State Highway
Department and has been practicing as a
Consulting Highway Engineer, has been
awarded the Roy D. Chapin Fellowship in
Highway Transport. He is conducting a
special research in Highway Economics.
Another Roy D. Chapin Fellowship in
Highway Engineering has been awarded
Richard Fauver from Lorain, Ohio. Mr.
Fauver graduated from Oberlin in 1917
and has since been engaged in highway
construction with the Ohio Engineering
Company. His investigation is Economic
Aggregates for Cement Concrete Pave-
ments and Structures.
E. R. Olbrich from Stillwater, Oklahoma,
has been awarded the Detroit Edison Fel-
lowship in Highway Engineering. Mr.
Olbrich received his C. E. degree in 1915
from Pennsylvania State College and was
engaged in much highway work, the last
being Assistant Professor of Highway
Engineering, Oklahoma Agriculture and
Mechanical College. Dust preventatives
and Surface Preservatives for Gravel
Roads is his research.
A Detroit Edison Fellowship in High-
way Engineering to Chia T. Yeh from
Shanghai, China. Mr. Yeh graduated from
Cornell in 1917 and has since been con-
nected with the Maintenance of Way De-
partment of the Kwangtung Samshiu Rail-
road. He investigates the Binding Value
of Michigan Gravels.
Harold Tuttle Corson, Michigan '18, has
been granted the National Steel Fabric
Company Fellowship in Highway En-
gineering and is investigating the Design
of cement Concrete Pavements and Foun-
dations of Structures.
ATHLETICS
Base Ball
Last year Michigan took the honors in
baseball and, judging from first reports,
the number of men and their ability, Mich-
igan is going to have another winning
team.
During Spring Vacation the team will
make the usual Southern tour. Starting
the season with a game with the University
of Kentucky on April 9th, at Lexington,
continuing on south to the University of
Alabama for the second and third games,
on the 11th and 12th. From there they go
to Oglethorpe University, playing the 13th
and 14th, and completing their trip with
the University of Georgia the 15th and
16th.
No rest is to be given the men, for the
first conference game comes the 23d with
Purdue on Michigan's own ground.
The season continues alternating be-
tween Ann Arbor and foreign diamonds.
Notre Dame at South Bend, April 30th.
A return game with Purdue at La-
Fayette, May 2nd.
Western State Normal here on May 4th.
Chicago here the ~th of May.
M. A. C. at Lansing, May 11th.
University of Iowa here, May 14th.
O. S. U. at Columbus the 16th.
A return game with Notre Dame here
the 18th.
Chicago at Chicago, May 21st.
University of Iowa again, at Iowa City
on the 23d.
O. S. U. here the 27th.
Illinois here the 28th.
Wisconsin here the 30th.
M. A. C. here June 1st.
Illinois on the 4th at Urbana.
Wisconsin at Madison, the 6th,
Finishing the season at Ann Arbor
against Wadseda, a Japanese team, on the
28th and 29th of June.
TRACK
Michigan to Compete wrrn California
Michigan's track team is to make the
long trip to California to compete with the
University of California in an outdoor


45
track meet on the 9th of April. This neces-
sitates the canceling of our entries in the
Penn Relays, the Drake Relays, and the
Eastern Intercollegiate meets because of
the ruling that any one athletic team may
lose but one week of school a semester,
and as it is necessary for the team to leave
the ist of April, their limit will be reached.
In order that no advantage in numbers
will be had by either University, each is
limited to a team of fifteen men. The
events are: 100 and 220 yard dash, in which
Michigan is well represented; the quarter,
half and two mile run; the mile relay, in
which Michigan again has some fast men;
the low and high hurdles; the high and
broad jump; and the pole vault, shot put,
and hammer, discus and javelin throw.
SCHEDULE
Chicago at Chicago on February 26th.
The Illinois Relays at Urbana, March
5th.
The Intercollegiates at Evanston on the
i9th.
Cornell at Ann Arbor the z6th.
April ist to May 7th is filled by the Cali-
fornia trip and a rest.
O. S. U. Meet at Columbus May /th.
Illinois at Urbana the i.jth.
Chicago here the 21 st.
With the final Conference Meet at Chi-
cago June 4th and 5th.
THE FOUNDRY SHOP
The foundry shop has proven itself to
be a very valuable asset to the University.
Of the 30 tons of castings used by the
storehouse, 15 tons were used by the build-
ings and grounds department in various
ways about the campus. This amounts to a
considerable saving in the course of a
year. Small repair jobs for the power plant
arc turned out in 12 hours from receipt of
order. All the manhole covers, surface
drains and everything pertaining to cast
iron used on the campus are made in the
foundry. Last year 45 tons of castings
were made. The buildings and grounds
department used last year three times as
much as was used 5 years ago.
In another way, the shop is a very de-
cided asset. Practically all the work is
done by students, who gain practical ex-
perience by working on jobs which are
similar to those met in actual practise. The
student has to follow the work thru from
core making to delivery. Test bars are
taken from every heat and a record made
of the transverse and tensile strength, and
chemical analysis. Thus an accurate record
of heats may be kept for future use.
Research work on the best types of sand
to be used for various types of castings
is being caried on, but the results are not
yet ready for publication.
"THE MATHEMATICIAN IN LOVE"
BY PROFESSOR RANKINE
A Mathematician fell madly in love
With a lady young, handsome, and charming; -
Her angles and ratios harmonic he strove
Her curves and proportions all faultless to prove,
As he scrawled hieroglyphics alarming.
He measured with care, from the ends of a base,
The arcs which her features subtended:
Then he framed transcendental equations, to trace
The flowing outlines of her figure and face.
And thought the result very splendid.


He studied (since music has charms for the fair)
The theory of fiddles and whistles,—
Then composed, by acoustic equations, an air,
Which, when 'twas performed, made the lady's long hair
Stand on end, like a porcupine's bristles.
The lady loved dancing,—fie therefore applied,
To the polka and waltz, an equation;
But when to rotate on his axis he tried,
His centre of gravity swayed to one side,
And he fell, by the earth's gravitation.
No doubts of the fate of his suit made him pause,
For he proved to his own satisfaction.
That the fair one returned his affection;—"because,
"As every one knows, by mechanical laws,
"Re-action is equal to action."
"Let x denote beauty,—y, manners well-bred,—
"z, Fortune,—(this last is essential),—
"Let L stand for love"—our philosopher said,—
"Then L is a function of x, y, and z.*
"Of the kind which is known as potential."
L=*(x, y, z)
"Now integrate L with respect to dt,
"(t standing for time and persuasion);
"Then, between proper limits, 'tis easy to see,
"The definite integral Marriage must be,—
"(A very concise demonstration)."
+oo
r
M=I.dt
— oo
Said he—"If the wandering course of the moon
"By Algebra can be predicted,
"The female affections must yield to it soon"—
—But the lady ran off with a dashing dragoon,
And left him amazed and afflicted.

THE ENGINEER'S NIGHTMARE
They come—a thousand horrid shapes and
forms,
To haunt me in my sleep,
Angles and tangents, areas and norms,
All through my tired brain, they creep
and crawl.
A company of transits come—look, look,
They amble up and fix their glassy eyes,
Upon me, now an old surveying book
Comes sailing near and o'er my bedpost
flies.
A log log slide rule extracts its roots,
And shrieks its figures in my frenzied
brain—
Corduroy pants and leggings, cowhide
boots
And all the whirling, shrieking, motley
train.
A hundred axes hang above my bed,
While flannel shirts are choking out my
breath,
A thousand cosines cluster round my head,
And drag me to a swift kinetic death.
Dynamics, statics, that is all I hear,
Your formulas are ringing in my ear,
And my elastic limit's reached, I fear—.
Go—ghoul some other harmless engineer.
—Hardy Hoover, '23.
Jack: "You will pardon me, but may I
ask your age?"
Floss: (Blushingly) "Oh, yes!"
Jack: "Well?"

Floss: "Certainly."

THE GREAT TEST
It was the last day of his final examina-
tions. The senior Lit. had reached the final
step in his struggle for the coveted degree.
But look! He sits sad-eyed, vacantly
staring at the blank blue book, in which
he was unable to answer a single question.
His eyes welled with tears. He realized,
but alas too late that he was a miserable
failure. His otherwise brilliant career
would be blighted forever. He could never
graduate.
On his left sat a student, his paper lying
invitingly open before him. Would he
yield to temptation? Would he fail at the
critical moment? No! By a mighty effort
of will, he kept himself from even glancing
at it. His aged father and mother could
never say that he had caused the slightest
stain upon the ancient and honorable es-
cutcheon of his noble family.
No! He would never copy from the man
on his left. The man on his right knew
more.
HE WENT RIGHT BACK
A friend of mine, the other day,
Who's been a long, long time away,
In some such place as Paraguay
Or China,
Returned. He'd made a wad in gum
Or Chinese hemp, and thought he'd come
Back to the States, where life was some—
What finer.
In quest of mirth I took him to
A place where they sell rare home-brew
(It's ninety proof, twixt me and you,
Regina)
Ingratitude, thy name is J!
No word of thanks the man did say.
He went right back to Paraguay—
Or China. —New York Sun.

SLEEPERS, BEWARE!
Out in the yard on a hot day the fore-
man found a laborer who was under the
lee of a lumber pile asleep. With a stern
smile, the boss said: "Slape on an' be
darned. While ye slape ye've got a job.
When ye wake up ye're out of wurrk."—

An educated engineer made the following
verbal report to his manager.
"This morning I went over to see a new
machine we've got at our place, and it's
astonishing how it works."
"And how does it work," he asked.
"Well," was the reply, "by means, of a
pedal attachment, a fulcrumed lever con-
verts a vertical reciprocating motion into
a circular movement. The principal part
of the machine is a huge disk, which re-
volves in a vertical plane. Power is ap-
plied through the axis of the disk, and
work is done on the periphery, and the
hardest steel, may by mere impact be re-
duced to any previously determined shape."
"What is this wonderful machine?" was
asked.
"A grindstone."—Exchange.

ESSAYS ON PIPE COURSES
E. E. 2a
(The essentials of electricity in lectures,
recitations and laboratory periods. Credit
—4 hours.)
The entire subject of electricity is ex-
ceedingly simple and elementary when
compared with the exact sciences given in
the Lit'ry department, such as "Creative
Listening," "Yodeling—iz," or "Ancient
Wind Instruments." In fact, if E. E. 2a
could only be made elective, thousands
would come from the farthest parts of the
world to drift lazily through it. Perhaps
even, the R. O. T. C. offices would have
to be vacated to make room for the eager
multitudes.
But as it is, it is only a required pipe.
No shop work, no drawing periods, and
merely four hours of lab work a week. In
fact, the work is so simple that not even
the theory of least squares or a knowledge
of the fourth dimension is required.
All a man has to do is work simple little
problems dealing with playful little am-
peres and henries, and darling little fluxes
being induced, (or was it seduced), to
such an extent that they chase each other
all around a three ring circus at 4% less
than synchronous speed. For instance:
Draw the regulation and external charac-
teristic curves of a small induction motor
with red trimmings and green striped in-
sulation, under the influence of a variable
flux changing at the rate of 60 times a
second, if the torque produced is just suf-
ficient' to maintain an oscillating peripheral
speed of negative infinity. The formula
used in this case is the most fundamental
formula of electricity, and on which all
our reasoning in that subject is based,
namely: It=Hel'

A prominent Jewish merchant and his
son were taking a sail on Lake Huron
during their summer vacation, when the

"Vadder, vadder, the boat's leaking."
"Vot ve care, Ikey, ve don't own it."
At last in desperation, Ikey spied a small
sloop.
"Vadder, I see a sail."
"Dot makes noddings by us. We ain't

to run down to the corner and buy him-
self something.

Grow deep and still, and their majestic presence

and Industry
PROFESSOR A. E. WHITE
IC
Research has been accepted and ac-
credited as a function of our schools
and colleges since their very establish-
ment. Even in the days when Latin
and Greek and Philosophy were the
main subjects in the curriculum it was
duly recognized that research into
the nooks and crannies of these fields
Professor A. E.
White had charge
formerly of re-
search for the
Jones &amp; Laughlin
Steel Co. In ipn
he joined the staff
of the Chemical
Engineering De-
partment of the
University. Dur-
ing the war period
he xvas in charge
of the Metallurgi-
cal Branch of the
Inspection Dili-

is no untried thing. That which is
new is the modern conception of its
function; a belief that greater atten-
tion should be directed in our univer-
sities and colleges to those phases of
research which will mean greater em-
ployment and greater prosperity for
the people. There are those in our
sion, Ordnance De-
partment, U. S.
Army, and later
was placed in
charge of the Met-
allurgical Branch.
Technical Staff.
Professor IIhitc
returned to the
University in IQIQ
and was appointed
Director of the De-
partment of Engi-
neering Research,
which was estab-
lished in January.
Professor A. E. White
for facts still undiscovered was a
fundamental and necessary function
of the instructor. We had research
with us then, we have it with us to-
day and if history permits of prophesy
we will have it with us until Gabriel
sounds his trumpet and summons us
all to that great beyond.
Thus research is no new thing. It
midst who feel that such a conception
of research is not in keeping with the
best traditions of our schools. They
feel that all research whether in the
philosophical or in the natural sciences
should be abstract, intangible. They
fear the possible corrupting effect of
money upon those engaged in research
since they believe that attempts will
or
c

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
be made to use research for the selfish
benefit of a few. They hold them-
selves aloof from matters of an indus-
trial character. Their training, their
very life work has necessarily kept
them out of contact with industry and
its needs. Because of their ignorance
they insist upon viewing collegiate re-
search in the same light as it was view-
ed by their grandfathers. They are
willing to profit by our material ad-
vances but are unwilling that our uni-
versities should have their share in
furthering these advances.
To whom do we owe the develop-
ments in our steam and electric trans-
portations? To whom do we owe the
electric light, modern sanitary equip-
ment, the automobile and the many
other things which make life easier
and pleasanter? Would we replace
our modern Pullman or automobile
with the leather strung coach, would
we return to our oaken bucket in pre-
ference to our modern bath room fix-
tures, do we prefer candles to the
electric lights? It is true that college
men have had their share in these de-
velopments, but—and here is the dis-
tinction—not as graduates or as alum-
ni doing their work in close contact
with the University, but when in large
measure, if not completely, divorced
from the University. It is true that
Michigan has contributed her share in
this very indirect manner. To Charles
P. Brush, an alumnus of the Univer-
sity of Michigan, we owe much in our
electric lighting but no one because
of his service associates Michigan with
the development of lighting. To How-
ard E. Coffin, a Michigan graduate,
and others of you here, many of you
Michigan graduates, we owe the mod-
ern automobile, but no one because of
your contributions associates the Uni-
versity with the development of the
automobile. In general it is true that
while college trained men have done
much in the development of industry
and engineering ,the universities have,
as institutions, kept somewhat aloof.
'Personally I have no quarrel with
those who believe the University
should stick closely to abstract re-
search. Personally I believe we should
encourage in every possible way work
of that type, for through it we widen
our knowledge, we add to our culture
and in the field of natural science we
work toward laws which are at the
foundation of science. I trust that as
the Department of Engineering Re-
search develops it will have funds
available for work of this type. May
the day come when all of the members
of the various facilities have at their
disposal funds to carry on such re-
search work as they desire and in such
magnitude as the work warrants.
The mistake which has been made in
the past, however, is that undue retic-
ence has been displayed by those in
authority at our institutions in the en-
couragement of industrial and engin-
eering research. This reticence is pos-
sibly a relic of the opposition which
engineering education has encounter-
ed since the days of its first inception.
It was only after overcoming much
opposition that Rennsalaer Polytech-
nic Institute for example was estab-
lished in 1837. It was felt for a long
time by many of the leading educators
of that period that the training at the
school was too practical to be in keep-
ing with the traditions of higher edu-
cation. Yet today we have no educat-
ors of moment who would make such
a charge against our modern engin-
eering schools and colleges.
Have not many of us as educators
gone only half way? In taking a lead-
ing part in engineering education but
not in engineering research, have we
not fulfilled only half of our mission?


Should we neglect engineering re-
search merely because it comes close
to the material concerns of mankind
which have great possibilties for add-
ing to our efficiency and comfort? In
an attempt to meet the old classical
research ideal have we not neglected
the modern view of engineering, es-
pecially that portion of it relating to
engineering research?
The neglect is readily explained.
The very rapid increase in attendance
in our engineering schools and col-
leges left the various members of our
faculties little time or strength to de-
vote to problems other than those of
teaching. At Michigan for example
the attendance in the Kngineering
Colleges has doubled in the past ten
(IO) years. . The demand that such
growth placed on the teaching force
is easily appreciated.
Research has also been impossible
because of lack of funds. The money
available was consumed in procuring
buildings and apparatus for instruc-
tional purposes, because of the rapid
increase in attendance, rather than in
procuring apparatus for research pur-
poses. Do you realize for instance,
that Dean Cooley has available for
the college year 1920-1921 for new
equipment the vast sum of $20,000?
Do you realize that this sum must be
distributed among the Departments of
Civil, Mechanical. Electrical. Chem-
ical, Marine and Aeronautical Engin-
eering, and Architecture? Do you
realize that in Chemical Engineering
we attempt to be conversant with in-
organic technology including work in
salts and work involving evaporation
in all of its various ramifications, with
organic technology including work in
suears, dyes, oils, and motor fuels,
with metallurgy including iron and
steel, copper, brass and bronze, and
with fuels including gas manufacture
and coking practice? Do you realize
that in these various fields we have
available for new equipment for the
year 1920-1921 $1,925, a sum not suf-
ficient even for the purchase of a mod-
erate priced automobile? To you
who have been given opportunities to
spend or authorize the expenditure of
sums ranging from a few thousand to
hundreds of thousands of dollars for
the purpose of solving a given prob-
lem do you imagine that much work of
real value can be produced under such
limitations? This statement involves
no charge against our University au-
thorities relative to an improper as-
signment of funds. The Engineering
College is given its pro rata. It does
imply, however, one of two things.
Either we have looked at matters at
the University from an utterly inade-
quate angle, or else those of you who
are in the industries have spent money
on research like drunken sailors. I
believe both implications are true and
that it will be to the advantage of in-
dustry from all angles if the Univer-
sity and the research work in our vari-
ous industrial centers can be brought
into closer contact.
This very limitation of funds has
seriously hampered the usefulness of
many of our teachers. They uncom-
plainingly attack problems with equip-
ment that seriously handicaps rapidity
of solution. You who are in the in-
dustries would no more think of un-
dertaking tests with the limited equip-
ment and facilities we possess than
you would think of turning Lake Erie
salt by pumping into the lake the brine
from our salt wells. Yet our teachers
carry on as best they can their work
under most extraordinary handicaps.
Is it any wonder that results are ob-
tained only slowly? Yet our univer-
sities are our most consistent and con-
tinuous producers of research. Is it

SOCIET
VOi


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
not a shame, therefore, that our men
work under such handicaps?
Beyond question the magnitude of
research at plants has far outstripped
that at our schools. Where we spend
a thousand dollars you spend a hund-
red thousand. Where we are com-
pelled to do all things ourselves, you
have every facility of equipment,
chemist, draughtsman, engineer, clerk
and stenographer. Where we have to
take down and replace apparatus be-
cause of lack of space, you build, if
necessary a special laboratory. Yet
there is this hand writing on the wall:
"Either there must be provided prop-
er facilities for research at our uni-
versities or else the grade of men ne-
cessary for the proper conduct of your
laboratories will not be forthcoming."
It is believed that this handwriting has
been seen. Especially is this true in
our own state and in consequence
there will shortly break a day when,
with respect to research, the Univers-
ity and the industries will be closely
allied.
Yet the University is not totally to
blame for the present lack of coopera-
tion. There has been and still is in
some lines of manufacturing a belief
that secret research will develop pro-
ducts of great value.
Cooperative research, cooperative
with respect to industries of an allied
type and cooperative with respect to
close contact with institutions of learn-
ing is the development of the day. Co-
operation in this manner means a free
interchange of information. It means
freeing industries from the fetters of
a belief in the Elysian powers of pat-
ents and in the value of secret process-
es. These two bogies have been most
powerful agents in preventing rational
cooperation. Business achievement is
more a matter of business administra-
tion and economics than of patents.
Can a single one of our automobile
companies lay its success to patents?
Are any of our furniture factories,
our stove plants, our iron and steel
and brass and copper plants de-
pendent for their success upon pat-
ents? To one company that attributes
its prosperity to patents there are
hundreds that cannot make such a
claim. Why, therefore, refuse to co-
operate with one another and with
the University merely because it may
entail a surrender of patent possibili-
ties and control of matters of public-
ity? Would not the saving resulting
from joint cooperation offset in prac-
tically every case the benefits obtained
through secrecy?
Even though matters of industrial
success depended upon secrecy, car-
rying as it would patent privileges and
deferred publication, is it expedient,
proper or wise that a state institution
should be a party to such a course?
Can the University lay itself open to
possible charges of serving private in-
terests? It would be quite proper to
issue patents in the name of the public
so that the unscrupulous would be
prevented from collecting blackmail
or deriving improper benefit from
something that might have been work-
ed out for the benefit of the public.
Before proceeding to a statement of
the proposed work of the Department
of Engineering Research, let us pause
and see if we can picture to ourselves
the industrial situation in the State.
In 1899 Michigan was the ninth
state in, the Union with reference to
the value of its manufactured pro-
ducts. In 1904 it had crept to eighth
place and in 1914 it occupied seventh
place. The census figures for 1919
are not yet out, but it is safe to say
that it has not stepped backward and
in all probability it is now in the fifth
or sixth place surpassed only by New


65
York, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Ohio.
Detroit has had a still more remarka-
ble growth, rising from sixteenth place
among the cities of the land in 1899
to fourth place in 1919.
Unfortunately there are no detailed
figures available for conditions since
1914. An industrial census is taken
every five years, the last one being in
1919, but the figures for this have not
as yet been made public. Conditions
for 1914 are given merely to enable
one to draw a mental picture of the
type of industries in Michigan, not
with any idea of giving a picture of
the extent of these industries. In
1914 there were six industries in
which Michigan took first rank; auto-
mobiles, druggist preparations, refrig-
erators, wooden goods not elsewhere
specified, show cases and aeroplanes.
There were five industries in which
she took second rank: furniture,
stoves, salt, wood distillation and wall
plaster. There were nine in which
she stood third, seven in which she
stood fourth and ten in which she
stood fifth.
The total value of Michigan's man-
ufactured products in 1914 is given
as $1,086,000,000. The estimated val-
ue for 1920 is probably close to $3,-
000,000,000. The leading industry,
beyond all question, in the State of
Michigan is the automobile. In 1914
this particular industry was credited
with a value to the finished product
of $298,289,022. By 1919 this had
risen to an estimated value of $1,393,-
000,000. Detroit's quota of this
amount is believed to be about 63 per
cent.
During the World War some of us
who served in a supervisory capacity
in the Inspection Division of the Ord-
nance Department estimated two and
one-half per cent of the value of the
finished product as the cost of inspec-
tion. Should we accept this percent-
age figure for this work and add to
it one of similar amount for research
we would have a sum total, based on
a $3,000,000,000 valuation of the man-
ufactured product for 1920 of $150,-
000,000 of which $75,000,000 would
be for inspection and $75,000,000 for
research. Are these figures too high?
If you think so go back to your plant
and learn the real facts regarding your
inspection costs—include not only the
labor of inspection, but labor lost on
work which before final assembly
proved to be defective, lost materials,
lost supplies such as fuel and lost use
of equipment.
Seventy-five million dollars looks
like a big sum for research, but let us
realize that we are taking a state-wide
view of the situation. There are men
here to-night from companies that
have not hesitated to spend $500,000
a year on research. It would take
only 150 such companies to make $75.-
000,000 and when we realize that the
number of good sized industrial con-
cerns in this 'State runs up into the
thousands this sum when distributed
shrinks into insignificance.
With this picture before us it is
not hard to realize what should be the
position of the Department of Engi-
neering Research in its relation to the
industries. It should become the re-
search center for the industries.
Each main group of industries
should band together in order that
problems that are common to all may
be worked out in a common center.
The University places its facilities at
your disposal.
But do you say we have no prob-
lems? That statement I expect from
sections which are dying of dry rot,
but not from a state which has shown
itself to be as vigorous and progres-
sive as Michigan. The minute you

cease to have problems you cease to be
alive and may such a day never come
to Michigan.
Do you say, though, we have no
problems of a common character?
There again I say that those indus-
tries of a similar type that cannot ally
themselves with one another to the
extent of rinding problems of a com-
mon character are not truly represen-
tative. They are not the type we de-
sire in this State. Either they lack
that spirit of cooperation so essential
to present day progress or else they
have become decadent and will not
long withstand the continual competi-
tion of modern business.
Do you say we are not sure whether
we will get results since we have little
choice in the selection of the men who
will do the work or the methods of
attack that will be pursued in an at-
tempt to solve the problem? To these
I would answer that the University
will be only too glad to cooperate with
you to find the right man or men for
the given problem or problems. Men
who will be assigned to problems will
be chosen on the basis of their fitness
irrespective of whether or not they
are now connected with the Univer-
sity. As a matter of fact there is not
now a man on the faculty who is not
carrying a full schedule. This means,
therefore, that the men who handle
these problems must either come from
the outside or else, if chosen from
within, we must find men to take their
present teaching positions.
Some concern has been expressed
that the Department of Engineering
Research would develop into a test-
ing bureau. \To fear need be enter-
tained on that score unless the indus-
tries themselves demand such a labor-
atory and will procure facilities so
that such a laboratory may function.
At the present time there are no funds
available for the maintenance of a
staff necessary for such a laboratory.
As a rule most concerns have a labor-
atory of their own for such work and
those that have not can send their
routine work to laboratories estab-
lished for just such purposes, which
are in a position to render the service
at a much lower cost than it could be
rendered at the University under pres-
ent conditions.
It is believed that the Department
of Engineering Research at the Uni-
versity of Michigan can be of distinct
service and value to the industries of
the state through the channels of cen-
tralized research. It is recommended
that the industries of the State with
interests closely allied join together.
It is recommended that there be form-
ed in each group a research commit-
tee to confer with the Director of the
Department of Engineering Research
on matters relating to problems and
policies. Included in this discussion
there should come up matters relating
to costs and details regarding how the
problem or problems are to be ap-
proached, who is to take charge and
other things of a pertinent and rele-
vant character. The committee un-
less otherwise empowered should then
report back its findings to the inter-
ests represented and procure from
them authorization to proceed with
the work. In the case of an individ-
ual industry the same general pro-
cedure should be followed.
The University has already pointed
out to the industries, that, although
desirous of doing everything in its
power to be of service, yet it cannot
assume, beyond a very nominal figure,
the cost of the investigations and re-
searches.
To be sure the facilities of the Uni-
versity Library are at the disposal of


the industries. This library is among
the largest 'in the country and is es-
pecially strong in technical books and
periodicals. No research should be
undertaken without a thorough study
of the literature on the subject. Of-
ten such a search saves thousands of
dollars. - On February first the indus-
tries of the State were advised of this
service but to date the resources of
the Library in this respect have not
been scratched. I question if the in-
dustries of the State can afford to
make as little use of libraries in the
future as they have in the past. Re-
quests for service may be made either
to the Librarian or to the Director of
the Department of Engineering Re-
search. This service includes the loan
of books and periodicals and at a nom-
inal charge, abstracts, bibliographies
and translations.
The service further includes the use
of buildings and parts of buildings
when not in use for instructional pur-
poses. At the present time there is
no space that can be set permanently
aside for this work because of the
large enrollment. One of our depart-
ment heads for instance, has but one-
half an office where he should have,
if given the same facilities as mem-
bers of the faculty have at Columbia
and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, two private laboratories
and a private office.
Further, the use of equipment and
apparatus, when not in use for in-
structional purpose, is placed at the
disposal of the industries at a fee only
sufficient to cover the cost of repairs,
renewals and replacement.
To sum up, therefore, the Depart-
ment of Engineering Research has
been established for the purpose of
assisting the industries in such proper
ways as lies within its powers. .It
places at the disposal of the industries
its library, its available laboratory
space and equipment. The industry
or industries requesting service pay
labor charges, provide special equip-
ment and pay a nominal fee for ad-
ministrative expense and the use of
equipment. As a state institution it
cannot grant special privileges. There-
fore work on which patients are de-
sired or privileges with regard to mat-
ters of publicity cannot be accepted.
It is recommended that the various
main groups of industry join together
and that problems of a joint charac-
ter be placed before the Department
of Engineering Research for solution.
It is believed that by this joint co-
operative alliance large sums can be
saved each company. The present
day is unquestionably one of coopera-
tion, economy and a strong belief in
the value of properly conducted re-
search. The Department of Engi-
neering Research is .founded on these
principles, trusting that it may be of
service to the industries of the State,
through them to the State proper, and
that in rendering service to these
groups it may be credited with duly
laboring for the cause of true science
of which research is the chief if not
the only servant.


BENJAMIN D. EDWARDS, Ph.B.,
Chancellor, Detroit Institute of Technology
The objective of every man is suc-
cess. In the light of world events of
the past several years, human achieve-
ment has been measured by service
rendered humanity. The progress of
mankind is and always will be depend-
ent upon the development of man's
works. This progress will be in di-
rect proportion to just how far sci-
ence and invention aid the human race
in enriching and ennobling lives, in
making tasks lighter and of shorter
duration, in promoting safety, and
thus preserving life and in increasing
recreation and mental attainment,—
and consequently happiness.
The work of the engineer is pri-
marily in the preparation of materials,
and in the design, construction, trans-
portation, and distribution of products.
Highly developed inventive genius
creates, splendid ideas and seasoned
judgment result in well proportioned
buildings, wonderful mechanisms, in
great railway systems, and other meth-
ods of distribution.
One of the great outstanding fea-
tures of the world war was the fact
that in every phase of the struggle,
science and invention played a con-
spicuous part—on land, on sea, and in
the air. Science and invention car-
ried death to the members of the op-
posing armies, just as science and in-
vention preserved life and healed the
wounded. The work of the engineer
in developing and transporting muni-
tions, in transporting men. in building
ships and fortifications was the pre-
dominant feature. The engineer won
the war.
In time of peace the constructive
work of the engineer embodies the
building of monuments, testifying to
his skill. But a far more lasting meth-
od of leaving the imprint of his life,
character, and effort would be in the
training of young men, in research
and in the extension of the education-
al program. Splendidly designed and
constructed apparatus, or great build-
ings will rust or decay, and soon be
forgotten; but the training of young
men results in enduring memory. The
development of new materials and
new methods at schools and colleges,
and the dissemination of useful infor-
mation which will make industry
more efficient or enable men to start
new industries, is one of the great
opportunities offered the engineer at
institutions of learning.
Research is vastly more essential to
the human race than are the duties of
the average designing or construction
engineer. Research creates and im-
proves, while ordinary engineering
work merely utilizes. The new devel-
opments in the sciences, the applica-
tions of new inventions will increas-
ingly, and rightfully so, be made at
institutions of learning. To entirely
change present day practice so that
production will be greatly increased
and costs greatly lowered would prove
a distinct contribution to the race.
When one considers the astounding
waste of natural resources, the enor-
mous loss of power from present day
power apparatus, and the tremendous
inefficiency of men in industries, it is
plainly evident that the savant has
within his grasp the revolutionizing
of industry. Standardization alone
68



I


69
is a broad field and a vital one just
now. Duplication of sizes of parts,
seasonal changes that frequently do
not better the product, and addition
and withdrawal of new parts and de-
signs result in tremendous loss of hu-
man labor and waste of materials. The
scrapping of jigs and fixtures in the
Automobile industry alone due to the
lack of standardization offers to the
college professor an opportunity to aid
by applying simple economic princi-
ples.
Extension of assistance by colleges
to commerce and industry has not yet
attained a comprehensive scale. Mere
experimentation without regard to the
needs of industry will not suffice. The
development of experimental research
to exactly and systematically fit the re-
quirements of the factory, mill, and
railway offers to the inventive young
instructor a great educational pro-
gram.
But important as is the research
work of the college to the community,
even more essential is the efficient
training of young men in engineering
and engineering trades. The raising
of standards of engineering education
will raise the standard of engineering.
The finding of raw materials and the
converting of them into useful things
is interesting to the practicing engi-
neer . Of how much more interest is
the finding of raw human material and
changing it into vital forces which
will benefit mankind. The young man
who has the bare foundation given
by high school training, who might
with proper assistance build thereon a
superstructure of great success, but
who, without the necessary means of
development, and application, might
be a liability to the community instead
of an asset, deserves the help of the
best talent the engineering profession
offers. As has already been pointed
out, service is the measure of success;
and the greatest service may be ren-
dered through instruction, because the
result is multiplied many fold.
The writing of text books embody-
ing new principles and precepts is im-
portant toward the development of the
engineer, and of engineering. But the
writing of correlated courses in each
branch of engineering which will def-
initely show the relation between the
subjects is infinitely more valuable.
The writing of courses so arranged
that the practical application is given
for each principle propounded would
fix in the minds of the students just
wnat relation that principle bears to
engineering work. A wide field is
open to the engineer who can develop
courses which will exactly fit the
needs of engineering, to supplant
related texts. There is a growing
need of co-operative systems of edu-
cation and more and more men will be
needed to co-ordinate part time educa-
tion with work so that the combination
will be equivalent to recognized day
school education. One of the recent
developments in engineering education
and one which promises a fertile field
for the young engineer who enters ed-
ucational work is the formulating of
certain principles and methods which
must be properly worked out, so that
there can be evaluated the practical
values of experience and achievement
of the more mature students, and the
allowing of the evidence of the prac-
tical values to substitute for a certain
portion of the school work.
The opportunities offered in voca-
tional schools are worthy of the engi-
neer's attention. The molding of
character and the instilling of honesty
in the youth will benefit industry. The
development of plans which will give
to the finished product full measure

of service is vital. The teaching of
accuracy, and efficiency in the earlier
stages makes up the accurate and effi-
cient man. Other traits of character
which should be instilled into the stu-
dent are fairness, a full day's work, a
true statement of facts, a true ar-
rangement of facts, giving credit
where due, taking blame where due,
and thinking of the interests of the
other fellow.
To the engineer who is graduating,
education presents a variety of lines
of endeavor. Not only the college or
university but the trade school, the vo-
cational school, the technical high
school are fields for service. With the
large number of industrial schools
created by law in the various states
splendid opportunities are offered to
train young men in the engineering
trades. Planning of courses of study,
supervision of training, and similar
work furnish the engineer a very in-
teresting field of endeavor. The prep-
aration of an endless variety of new
projects, new methods and new appli-
cations, present a man's size job and
one which the engineer, and he alone,
can develop.
The vocational and trade school of-
fer intensely interesting courses and
the choosing of a proper curriculum
and development of trade standards
as well as school supervision are best
done by the engineer, for he sees in
the mechanical and electrical trades
the application of many engineering
principles—and the useful arts them-
selves always indicate definite progress.
This, coupled with the fine accomplish-
ment of teaching the men principles
which will advance them beyond their
present status, that will widen their
vision, and cause them to assume a
new relation to society, will compen-
sate the engineer for his devotion to
education.
The young man acquired early those
traits which mark him for life. His
habits, his method of thinking and do-
ing, are pliable, and easily formed.
Ex-President Taft says that "It is as
easy to acquire good habits as it is
bad ones, therefore acquire good hab-
its." He might have added that the
mental and physical processes may be
either strengthened or quickened on
the one hand by proper training, or
dwarfed on the other by improper in-
struction. The man who is shiftless
in the class room will be shiftless out
on the job. If his work is not com-
plete, if it is slighted during his train-
ing, he will just as surely slight his
work as an engineer.
In comparison with the average en-
gineer's salary, the average instruc-
tor's salary compares very favorably.
The possibilities of preparing reports
and the spreading of information will
place the name of the savant in an in-
effaceable place in the minds of his
fellow-beings and leave his best pro-
duct—careful thought—written on the
hearts of men. His students will ever
remember the teachings which guide in
choosing the proper branch of engi-
neering, the advice which taught hon-
esty, and the counsel which taught ac-
curacy and care. In a word, if the
engineer would give to the world his
largest measure of service, he will
have his works endure better and
longer if his products instead of be-
ing in stone or steel are men.


Primitive Cannon (After Biringuccio. 1540)
The Origin and Early Use of Cast Iron
PROFESSOR W. P. WOOD
Cast iron was not known to the
ancients, since we find no authentic
historical record of its use until about
the middle of the fifteenth century.
The iron which was known and used
in early times resembled more nearly
the metal which we term wrought
iron. It was obtained through a di-
dect reduction of the ore by means of
charcoal, the whole operation being
-carried out in a rude forge, which
many times was nothing more than a
shallow pit in the ground. Steel has
been used, of course, for many cen-
turies, it only being necessary to car-
burize wrought iron to produce this
product. Steel, however, was very ex-
pensive and its main use lay in the
manufacture of weapons and armor.
One very naturally asks the ques-
tion why such a useful material as
cast iron was not discovered and used

at an earlier date. Briefly stated, the
reason is this: — None of the early
metallurgical furnaces allowed suffi-
cient carburization of the iron to
bring about a lowering of the melting
point to such a degree that fusion
could take place. A consideration of
the accompanying melting points will
make this clear:
Wrought iron (0.10% Carbon).1505°C
Steel (145% Carbon) I425°C
Cast Iron (3.8% Carbon) 1 i5o°C
An intense heat is necessary to melt
wrought iron and for that reason the
ancient metallurgists took the iron
from the furnace in a pasty condition
and hammered it into the shape desir-
ed. It never was hot enough in those

Catalan Forge
old forges to melt the iron while the
ore was being reduced. In order to
obtain a .rapid absorption of carbon by
iron it is necessary to have the iron
molten as in the crucible steel process.
This condition was never obtained in
the ancient forges. Hammering also
served to remove most of the slag
which was formed during the reduc-
tion of the ore.
We will now turn to a consideration
of some of these old furnaces and
trace out the line of development
which finally brought about furnace
conditions of such a nature that suffici-
ent carburization and consequent fus-
ion could take place.
The first hearths for the reduction
of iron ore are practically all includ-
ed under the term "Catalan Forge"
from the province of Catalonia in
Spain. As may be seen from the ac-
companying illustration the furnace
consisted only of a shallow hearth
with a single air pipe or tuyere. The
blast was furnished by a device called
a Trompe which was much similar in
principle to the filter pumps at present
used in chemical laboratories. The
mixture of charcoal and ore was rab-
bled around by hand, more charcoal
being added from time to time, until
a plastic mass of iron was obtained.
The chemistry of the process involves
the separation of the oxygen from
the iron thru the agency of carbon and
carbon monoxide.
The Osmund furnace represents the
second step in the growth of the iron
industry. This was probably develop-
ed in Sweden during the twelfth or
thirteenth century. It is seen to be
much similar to the Catalan forge in
principle but is more elegantly con-
structed and has a higher hearth. The
old records give this height as about
seven feet. The old iron masters evi-
dently believed in keeping the whole
family busy for the lady in the picture
is seen to be working with her distaff
at the same time that she operates the
treadles which work the bellows.
We now come to the furnace which
is the actual progenitor of our modern
blast furnace, namely, the German
Stiickofen or Wolf oven, in which
the first cast iron was produced. Its
genesis may be quite easily traced.
We can fancy one of those old metal-
lurgists watching his Osmund furnace
in operation and trying to figure out
some scheme which would make it
work faster. Suddenly he has an idea.
Why not build another inverted Os-
mund furnace on top of his original
one. He will thus increase his cap-
acity and hold his reducing gases in

contact with his work for a greater

The height of the Stiickofens usu-
ally varied between 12 and 16 feet.
The blast was introduced thru one or
two tuyeres at the base of the furnace
and when the heat was completed the
lump of iron was removed thru the
opening seen at the lower right side
of the picture. During the operation,
this hole was luted up.
Jn this furnace the reduced iron
had a much longer time to be in con-
tact with the fuel and temperature was
also higher. As a result of this, some
time in the fourteenth century an un-
fortunate iron worker found a stream
of some molten material running out
from the lower opening in his furnace.
Examination proved that this was
iron, but iron in an extremely unwork-
able condition. It has been stated that
in Spain at one time, allowing iron to
melt in the furnace was a capital of-
fence.
Gunpowder began to come into quite
general use during the fourteenth cen-
tury and it was in this connection that
cast iron was given its first chance to
prove its usefulness. The first cannon
used were made of wrought iron.

friend and foe alike. Three of these
"barrel" guns were recovered in 1836
from the British vessel "Mary Rose"
which sank during a battle with the
French in 1545. It was not long, of
course, before some one thought to
use the previously despised cast iron
to fashion heavy ordnance material.
It is said that the first iron cannon cast
in England was produced by Ralph
Hogge in 1543 at his foundry in Sus-
sex. There is evidence that cast iron
cannon had been made on the contin-
ent of Europe before this date.
Besides the casting of heavy ord-
nance, the manufacture of stove plates

Stuckofen
was carried on to a very great extent.
The probable reason for this lies in
the fact that stove plates could be cast
in open sand molds, where the pattern
needed only to be lifted up from the
mold. The large flat surface present-
ed by the mold for a stove plate gave
great possibilities for the molders to
exercise their artistic instincts. The
first decoration of the stove plates was
furnished by merely pressing the open
hand upon the face of the mold. Eat-
er, very ornate designs were worked
up and added to the castings. The
early stoves were largely made up of
flat castings, and often supported by a
wrought iron frame. These stoves
were considered great luxuries and
were very expensive. Only the nobil-
ity could afford them at first.
Realizing the limitation of the open
sand mold, we soon find the early
foundrymen experimenting with var-
ious methods of molding in order to
produce castings of more intricate de-
sign and form. The first method used
was this: A pattern of wood or wax
was prepared. Clay was packed all
around this pattern and allowed to
harden. Molten metal was poured
into the mold and the pattern actually
burned out. Very soon, of course,
wax alone was used, since it could be
melted and poured out of the hardened
mold. The art of preparing molds for
all types of castings, using permanent
removable patterns took a good many
years to develop.
All of the early castings were made
from "direct metal," that is, the iron
was run directly from the smelting
furnace to the mold. Castings made in
this manner are always of rather un-
certain chemical composition. About
the middle of the eighteenth century,
the increasing demand for cast iron
often made it necessary for the foun-
dry to produce large numbers of cast-
ings of a certain grade. It was easily
seen that uniformity in chemical com-
position, etc. was impossible if direct
metal was used. Reaumur apparently
first introduced the use of a secondary
cupola furnace about 1750, and from
then on we find the great improvement
in quantity production of cast iron.
The first cupola furnace was built
in the United States about 1820. In
100 years this industry has grown to
such an extent that practically every
small city and village in the country
has its foundry.

L. A. BAIER. 'I3E
We hear a good deal of talk, among us who are students, regard-
ing the selection, or election, of studies. Of course it is impossible for
anyone to lay down a program which would infallibly produce satis-
factory engineers. But we have requested several engineering grad-
uates in various branches of the profession to write of the one or IT&lt;'O
greatest obstacles which, in the opinion of each, a student must over-
come if he is to enter a particular field with the best possible training
for it. It is quite true that young graduates hit a common stumbling
block. Mayhap if we were shoum such stumbling blocks a few might
benefit by their disclosure. It is with such a hope that this and arti-
cles to follow in immediately succeeding issues are offered. This
particular article is especially for Naval Architects but its suggestions
might well be heeded by all of us. Mr. L. A. Baier, the author, is
Assistant Naval Architect of the Baltimore Dry Docks and Shipbuild-
ing Company, of Baltimore, Md. — Editor's Note.
At the outset let me state that I
shall by no means attempt in this ar-
ticle to confess my inner thoughts on
the proper curriculum and subject
matter that is indispensable for the
proper University training of an en-
gineer. This is the pet theme of
every alumnus and sooner or later
must he unburden himself. I remem-
ber a Professor of the Engineering
College once telling me of a plan the
faculty tried, to obtain the views of
alumni throughout the country on the
best arrangement of courses and
choice of subjects. A review of the
returned questionnaires brought out
the fact that if an attempt were made
to include all the subjects thought so
desirable by these alumni the under-
graduate course in engineering would
of necessity have to be lengthened to
twelve or fifteen years.
So let us assume that the present
engineering courses have been assem-
bled after a great many years of ex-
perience and trial to represent the
best educational thought for an engi-
neer's preliminary training. I should
like to bring out one or two features
that I have found by experience to be
of prime interest to an engineer en-
tering the field of ship design and con-
struction.
Any engineer to be successful must
not only have a perfect grasp of the
theory of engineering, but must also
be thoroughly familiar with the prac-
tical art of construction and fabrica-
tion. Particularly true is this for a
Naval Architect. Embodied in a com-
pleted modern steamship, be it a naval
craft or humble commercial vessel, are
the productions of more separate and
varied crafts than found in any other
work of construction. For example,
a 10,000 ton cargo steamer, costing
75


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
-
perhaps $1,500,000 to construct, will
represent the efforts of many trades,
most of which are at work in the
shipyard where the vessel has been
constructed. These are the iron
workers, made up of loftsmen, fitters,
riveters, drillers, reamers, caulkers,
shopmen, etc.; the joiners, carpen-
ters, sheet metal men, painters, dec-
orators, upholsterers, riggers, cop-
persmiths, blacksmiths, boilermakers,
electricians, machinists, patternmak-
ers, foundrymen, pipe fitters, drafts-
men, accountants, clerks, etc. The de-
signer must be familiar with all these
crafts and be able to control and di-
rect their various efforts to produce
economically and successfully the ship
that was born of his thought.
Therefore, my first plea is to make
use of every spare moment while in
college to learn the art of fabrica-
tion, construction and operation. I
believe the course leading to a degree
of Bachelor of Engineering should be
lengthened to five years, that no sum-
mer classes be required, and that every
effort be made to place the student
each summer vacation in the field, or
shop to learn by hard work and close
contact the practical or mechanical
side of his profession. The main
handicap an engineer has when leav-
ing school is the inability to talk to
the outside men in the yard, to the
shop foremen, the mechanics, the rig-
gers, in their own language. Many a
promising designer has failed because
of his lack of appreciation that the
outside man is the one who will build
what is created in the designer's mind
and unless there is close harmony and
contact success cannot be obtained. I
would suggest that the first summer
vacation be spent on a ship at sea. Ship
as an oiler, deckhand or even mess-
boy, but get to sea on the deck of a

living ship. Learn what a ship and
her crew must go through; it will be
hard work, but-the results will be more
than worth it. The next summer
should be spent in a shipyard, not in
the drawing office or at some white
collar job, but out in the yard work-
ing with one's hands. Help to build
a ship and appreciate the difficulties
encountered to produce in steel the
design shown on a blueprint. The third
summer should again be spent at sea
in the engine room or on deck. The
fourth summer can be spent again in
another shipyard in some different
outside department. I am satisfied that
such a combination of theory and
practice will turn out a graduate well
fitted to take his place in the cold
world of reality and facts.
The second handicap under which
I have found many young graduates
to labor is the lack of proper system
of filing personal data and records.
Data of past performances is one of
the engineer's main tools, and during
the first few years the young engi-
neer acquires boxes and trunks full of
articles from magazines, data stolen
from fellow designers, records of act-
ual jobs familiar to himself, blue-
prints, etc. The problem becomes
what to keep, how to keep it and how
to analyze it for future use. Each stu-
dent in his undergraduate days should
be taught, or devise himself, a proper
system for keeping data. This is a
much more serious problem than us-
ually so considered and some thought
should be directed along this line in
one of the junior year courses. It is
surprising how few engineers really
have such a well planned system. In
fact my experience has been that the
men who have risen from the ranks
without the advantages of a theoreti-
cal training, have usually the best


means of keeping data and references.
They have not had the opportunity to
acquire the principles of engineering,
and to hold up their job they must
have ready reference to all the data
available on any problem at hand.
My third and last suggestion is
with reference to elective courses. I
understand that in late years the un-
dergraduate is given considerable lee-
way in the number of hours and class
of electives he may assume to round
out the required hours of study. My
observation has been that the young
engineer on graduating is very defi-
cient in ordinary business terms and
procedure, in accounting, and in cost
keeping. Therefore it would be well
to elect several hours' work in these
subjects while in college. Every engi-
neer sooner or later finds that he drf its
into contact with estimating costs,
which in turn require more or less
knowledge of cost keeping, account-
ing, book-keeping, etc. A familiarity
with these subjects not only helps to
develop a well-rounded man but also
instills that feeling of confidence so
necessary when the work drifts to-
ward the shoals of financial terms and
management.
Each individual engineer upon grad-
uating will find a different trend and
branch to follow in his profession
each bringing its own trials and hand-
icaps to be overcome, but I trust the
above remarks will, in a measure, help
to lift my following slip-stick broth-
ers over a few of the bumps.
Impressions of Economic Conditions
in England
PROFESSOR JOHN AIREY
The following remarks are based
OII impressions gathered during a four
weeks' stay in England during Janu-
ary and February of this year.
General industrial conditions are
interesting but depressing. With few
exceptions the people are better sit-
uated financially than formerly, the
standard of life is higher, the lack of
thrift is apparent, grumbling is a hab-
it and posterity pays the bill. The
peak appears to have passed and in
the opinion of some manufacturers
another year will see reasonable sta-
bility. The intensity of application by
the manual worker is but a shadow of
former days; juvenile labor is decid-
edly at a premium even in comparison
with adult labor. Looking ten years
ahead one can reasonably predict a
shortage of skilled help due to the
probable stifling of the time honored
apprentice system, the least that can
happen is a serious modification of
the apprentice system and this will
cause England to tend to the condition
of semi-skilled help so common in the
United States. Further, this country
will not be able to draw on England
for skilled mechanics to the extent
customary in the past.
The housing question is severely
acute and constitutes a classical exam-
ple of the vicious possibilities' when
fundamental economic laws are stifled
by legislation. Early in the war it
was made illegal to evict tenants or to
increase rents. The cost of labor has

NG • SOCIETY
ozi

"
gone up at least three times, the cost
of material has at least doubled.
These two factors obviously make it
impossible to build houses that can
rent on terms comparable with exist-
ing houses. This situation has been
made doubly difficult by the fact that
the rate of interest for a given type
of security or investment has also
nearly doubled. Since the Armistice
a thirty percent and a ten percent in-
crease in rents have been legalized:
this, however, is quite insufficient to
meet the situation. For a period, in
an attempt to bridge the gap, the Gov-
ernment subsidized house-building at
the rate of two hundred and fifty
pounds per house, which amount be-
fore the war was sufficient to build a
house complete. In spite of this,
"new rents" and "old rents" are on
different planes and as a result the
anomalous situation arises where one
hears discussions, perplexing to the
uninitiated, on how much one is pay-
ing for a key—sometimes fifty pounds
is paid. In other words a definite sum
is paid to the landlord prior to enter-
ing the house for the express privi-
lege of paying him the legal rent.
There appears no immediate solution
to this problem. The Brick-Layers'
Union have rejected the "dilution"
proposal which was a proposal to aug-
ment their ranks by means of ex-serv-
ice men who had no pre-war experi-
ence as brick-layers but who had been
trained on government pay as brick-
layers. The result of this refusal to
accept 'dilutees" means that the would-
be dilutees continue out of work, re-
ceive unemployment pay from the
State thus swelling taxation, mean-
while people go houseless.
The E. P. D. (Excess Profits
Duty) was everywhere disliked. This
tax was 80% last year, and has been
completely removed for this year
much to the satisfaction of all busi-
ness men. Income tax on income in
excess of three hundred and seventy
pounds is thirty per cent on unearned
income. There is a general belief that
banks are "bulging with money" al-
though the Bank Rate remains at
seven per cent. Municipalities are of-
fering six per cent and up to ten years
maturity. This same type of invest-
ment commanded three to three and
a half per cent before the war.
English Courts of Justice appear to
operate with their time-honored rigor
for there are cases of well-known citi-
zens serving sentences because of eva-
sion of E. P. D., or income tax.
I regret to say however that profit-
eering has been nauseatingly rampant.
One obtains a viewpoint of war ex-
perience over there quite impossible in
this country. This is obtained from
men, and there are many of them, who
served three years or more at the
front. The outstanding horror of the
war to them was the terrific monotony.
Apparently physical danger was a
mere detail compared with the cease-
less grind of monotonous duties:
particularly was this true of the think-
ing type of men in front line work.

HISTORICAL
The growth of New York City has created an ever-increasing demand
for rapid and uninterrupted transportation to and from the commercial and
business center of Manhattan Island. Four bridges span the East River,
three of which have been built during the past twenty years. During the
same period, ten tunnels, principally for railroad and subway communica-
tion, have been constructed under this River, so that to the eastward Man-
hattan Island is closely linked with adjacent territory. To the westward,
three tunnels have been built under the Hudson River,-—one for the Pennsyl-
vania Railroad, two for the Hudson-Manhattan subway system ; but all other
transportation is dependent upon ferries, subject to delays from fogs, ice,
and storms;—river traffic occasionally being stopped more than a day at
a time.
In 1906, New York and New Jersey each appointed a Commission to
act jointly for the consideration of a Hudson River bridge. A preliminary
report was made, but nothing further was done, the span being extremely
long and there was some question as to adequate pier foundations.
In 1913, after the second highway tunnel had been built under the
Thames River in London, the scope of the Commissions' investigations was
broadened to include tunnels, and from that time the Commissions were
known as Bridge and Tunnel Commissions. A firm of consulting engineers,
experienced in river tunneling, worked out plans and an estimate for a
vehicular tunnel. Some diversity of opinion arose as to what type of cross-
ing was immediately practicable, and for the time being, the matter was
dropped.
The question was again taken up in 1916 by the Public Service Corpora-
tion of New Jersey, a private concern, which Corporation appointed a Board
of Engineers to report on a vehicular tunnel. Financial conditions in 1917
and the entry of this country into war again stopped further consideration
of the project.
While action was delayed by various influences from time to time, the
necessity for an uninterrupted roadway to the westward became more and
more imperative. Seven out of nine of the leading railroads serving New
York have terminals on the west side of the River, and these bring to the
City a large part of its daily necessities, as well as quantities of raw material
for manufacturing purposes. During the severe winter of 1917-18, the
Harbor was so blocked with ice that for days at a time it was impossible to
lighter freight across the River, thereby cutting off'even the City's daily food
and coal supply, a condition which in lesser degree is experienced nearly
every winter. Public sentiment finally became aroused to the fact that some
form of uninterrupted vehicular crossing must be had, and the State Com-

missions, which had been continued, obtained a third report on a tunnel
crossing.
The 1913 report advocated a shield driven, cast iron lined tunnel; the
1916 report, a pre-cast concrete tunnel to be placed by the trench method;
and the 1918 report, a shield driven tunnel with concrete block lining. On
July 1, 1919, the Commissions organized an Engineering Staff with C. M.
Holland as Chief Engineer, for the purpose of reviewing past reports and
making further studies for a vehicular tunnel, with the definite idea of pro-
ceeding at once with tunnel construction.

TiE-ur of Traffic Waiting for Ferries to Jersey City
LOCATION
All previous reports have agreed that the most suitable place for a
downtown crossing is from Canal Street, Manhattan, to 12th Street, New
Jersey. This connects on the New York side with main thoroughfares, some
of which lead directly to two of the East River Bridges. On the New
Jersey side, it leads directly to the 13th Street Viaduct, which carries a road-
way to Newark and points west. (See Plate No. 1). Recent traffic studies
indicate that this site is well chosen, as it is the center of gravity of vehicular
traffic across the downtown ferries.
At this point, conditions are particularly suitable to a tunnel rather than
a bridge. The adjacent shore is flat, requiring bridge approaches that would
occupy tracts of highly improved property. A tunnel with grades similar
.to those of a bridge would bring the roadway to the surface about half as far


from the river as a bridge approach, with comparatively little disturbance to
adjacent property. The Government requires a bridge to clear 180 feet
above and a tunnel 55 feet below mean high water, but for safety of con-
struction and maintenance, the tunnel is located from 5 to 10 feet deeper.
As far as total grade enters into the transportation of vehicles at this point,
the advantage is with the tunnel. In the case of the bridge, a vehicle would
have to climb approximately 75 feet more before reaching the center of the
river than it would be obliged to climb on the exit grade of a tunnel.
TRAFFIC
In order to ascertain the volume, character, distribution and source of
vehicular traffic, counts covering three consecutive days were made on all
ferries. By comparison with the records of previous years, furnished
through the courtesy of the ferry companies, the annual rate of traffic growth
since 1914 was found to be approximately 5%. The annual increase of
similar traffic over East River Bridges for the same period of time has been
approximately 23%.
The most noticeable feature is the gradual decrease in horse-drawn
vehicles and a corresponding increase in motor trucks. In 1914, horse-
drawn vehicles comprised 87% of the total traffic and motor vehicles 13%.
In 1920, 43% were horse-drawn and 57%, motor driven. It is anticipated
that shortly the horse-drawn vehicle will reach a minimum, but will not be
entirely eliminated, for it does serve economically certain needs of trans-
portation. A forecast of future traffic is based to a certain extent upon ferry
traffic growth, but in the main it is made to conform with the growth of
traffic over the East River Bridges. A safe and uninterrupted highway once
established begets traffic, of which no evidence is available before the high-
way is built.
The number of vehicles that will seek the tunnel has been somewhat
arbitrarily estimated from forecasts of ferry and lighterage traffic. It was
assumed that a large percentage of traffic in the immediate vicinity would
use the tunnel; of traffic originating some distance away, the faster moving
vehicles would go to the tunnel; and traffic from a long distance would, in
general, route itself to pass through the tunnel. It is anticipated that some
freight that is now lightered across the river will be trucked through the
tunnel, also that finally horse-drawn vehicles will use the ferries rather than
the tunnel, as these vehicles would gain nothing in time and the horses would
be deprived of a chance to rest while crossing.
TUNNEL CAPACITY
To provide a tunnel of sufficient size to accommodate the anticipated
traffic, the capacities of one, two and three-line roadways were studied.
Counts were made on the East River Bridges, where the roadways are prac-
tically comparable with the tunnel both as to grades and as to freedom of
interruption from cross traffic, and the character of traffic is similar to that
at the Hudson River crossing. The Brooklyn Bridge carries one line of


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
vehicular traffic in each direction, Williamsburgh and Manhattan Bridges
each two lines, and Queensboro Bridge, three lines. Spacing between
vehicles varies with speed in order to insure safety of operation, not only in
the line of traffic, but additional width is necessary for rapid moving ve-
hicles. The results of the bridge counts indicate the following capacities:
CAPACITIES OF ROADWAYS
Vehicles Vehicles Vehicles
Per Hour Per Day Per Year
ONE LINE ROAD—
With both horse-drawn and motor vehicles 480 5.850 1,900,000
With motor trucks and passenger cars only 630 7,700 2,620,000
TWO LINE ROAD—
With both horse-drawn and slow motor vehicles in
on eline and fast motor trucks and passenger
cars in second line 1,600 19,500 6,635,000
With motor vehicles only in both lines 1,900 23,200 7,900,000
THREE LINE ROAD—
With horse-drawn vehicles in one line and motor
vehicles in two lines 2,625 32,000 10,900,000
With motor vehicles only in all three lines 3,020 36,800 12,500,000
In ordinary city streets interrupted by cross traffic, the capacity of the
different lines is about one-half that given above.
A two-line roadway for each of the two tubes was deemed the most
feasible for the following reasons:
It will accommodate all traffic seeking a crossing at this point for the
immediate future. The extra cost of a three-road tunnel, put at interest,
would in about twelve years build another tunnel at a different location.
At capacity operation, it will accommodate all traffic the adjacent streets
of the City can handle without extensive street widening and other improve-
ments involving enormous cost.
The width of the roadway varies directly with the diameter of the
tunnel, while cost of the tunnel varies almost with the square of the diameter.
Accordingly, it would be very unsound economically to build a tunnel road
so wide that it could not be used to capacity on account of insufficient en-
trance and exit facilities. Therefore ample plaza facilities have been pro-
vided to insure the use of the tunnel roadway to full capacity. Furthermore,
the entrance and exit on each side of the river have been separated to avoid
congestion between inbound and outbound traffic.
It has been considered essential, however, to provide ample width for
the safe and rapid operation of each line of traffic, consideration being given
to future increase in the size of vehicles. The roadway provides 10 feet
for each line of vehicles. The clear head room is 13J/2 feet.
The legislative act which authorized the tunnel requires a passageway
for pedestrians, but the walk has been considered only as an emergency exit
from the tunnel and as a means of properly policing traffic.


TUNNEL STRUCTURE
A tunnel structure suitable for the project has to meet two funda-
mental requirements:
It must be adapted to a vehicular roadway, and
It must be adapted to Hudson River conditions.
Many tunneling schemes have been considered but those worth detail
Ftudy narrowed down to the three types advocated in previous reports. A
review of these, together with further detailed investigation, has led to the
conclusion that the shield driven, cast iron lined tunnel is best adapted to
this project.
The shield tunnel, circular in form, accommodates itself to a vehicular
roadway, as the wide portion of the tunnel near the middle will serve as a
roadway, while the space both above and below can be used for ventilating
ducts. This method of tunneling has reached a stage where it is possible to
drive a shield tunnel with little disturbance to overlying structures. While


SCCT/ON
this is not an important feature in the river section proper, it is a vital and
controlling feature in the approach sections that pass under such highly
developed areas as West Street, and the New York and the Erie R. R. ter-
minal in Jersey City. Whatever method was used in the mid-river section,
it was evident that the shield method was the one adapted to the shore
sections.
The Hudson River mud is particularly adapted to shield tunneling, in-
asmuch as some of the material can be pushed out of the way without having
to be excavated through the tunnel. The material that has to be excavated is
not dug out from the front of the shield, but by opening doors during the
shove the material slides back into the tunnel where it can be conveniently
loaded for disposal. This practically eliminates danger from blow-outs. In
the Hudson-Manhattan tunnels, one tube 18 feet in diameter was shoved
through this material with practically no excavation at all being taken
through the tunnel. The Pennsylvania Railroad tunnels 23 feet in diameter
required 35 per cent of the material to be excavated. The limiting feature
in the excavation is the question of keeping the shield to line and grade.


THE MICHIGAN TECHN1C
When the shield is advanced without excavation, the displaced material
moves upward, carrying the shield with it. The doors of the shield are then
opened and material taken in for the purpose of relieving this pressure in
front, thereby keeping the shield to proper grade. Another very interesting
feature of this material, and something which shows its elastic characteristics,
is the fact that it compresses and decompresses with change in tide. High
tide with an additional 5-foot blanket of water compresses the material
slightly; with the receding tide, it expands and the bed of the river rises.
This movement at tunnel depths amounts to about three-eighths of an inch.
Several kinds of lining for shield driven tunnels have been considered,
but a thorough study indicates the most feasible to be cast iron. The use of
concrete blocks was given careful study, but it was decided that these were
inadequate to meet conditions in Hudson River silt, particularly for a tunnel
29 to 30 feet in diameter. Experience in driving shield tunnels has proven
that the joint is the weakest part of the structure, first as to strength and
second as to water-tightness, and in the design of more recent tunnels an
effort has been made to strengthen this joint by machining the segments so
that they bear iron to iron, and by increasing the bolting strength. This not
only produces a safer tunnel lining, but also gives better joints for caulking
and stopping leakage. While analyses based upon the distortion of an elastic
ring may give a fairly definite idea of the stresses in a tunnel lining when
once in place, it has been found that the most severe stress that the lining has
to bear occurs within 200 feet of the shield when it has to support eccentric
loads from the adjacent earth, before the ground has thoroughly gripped
the lining on all sides and before reactive ground pressures come fully into
play. Measurements on the tunnel lining as it leaves the shield show that
it goes through a snake-like movement, sometimes to one side, sometimes to
the other, almost invariably settling before it takes its final position. This
movement varies with the size of the tunnel and may be as much as 3 or 4
inches. It is to this period of construction that particular consideration has
been given in studies of tunnel design. For the above reason, concrete blocks
—not bound solidly together immediately upon leaving the shield, but more
or less dependent upon mortar, grout or some other form of connection to
harden before full strength can be developed, were deemed inadequate.
The trench tunnel meets conditions necessary for a vehicular roadway
and has been given careful study. This crossing is at a busy section of New
York Harbor; during 24 hours, a total of 1,500 vessels pass up and down
the river. The danger of collision to any tunnel plant anchored in mid stream
is serious,—dredging plants for deepening the harbor suffer considerably
from this source. Government restrictions are very strict and require that
adequate measures be taken to insure an uninterrupted passage of boats. On
each side of the river are valuable piers, the destruction or interference with
which is a large item of expense.
Hudson River silt is composed of clay and very fine sand, and. as pre-
viously stated, is of a soft nature. On this account, it is anticipated that con-
siderable quantities will slide or be washed into the trench by the tide, so
that the side slopes of a cross current trench would be flat and the volume of
excavation large. The above features considered on broad lines are vital


factors affecting the adoption of the trench method of construction for this
crossing.
VENTILATION
From the first, the question of ventilation has been given careful study
as one of the most important problems in planning the tunnel. Vehicular
tunnels now in use do not compare in length with the Hudson River crossing,
and, at present, have no artificial means of ventilation. This problem is
under investigation along three different lines:
1. Amount and composition of exhaust gases from motor vehicles;
2. Dilution necessary to render the exhaust gas harmless;
3. Method and equipment necessary for adequate ventilation.
Experiments to determine the composition of exhaust gases have been
carried out at Pittsburgh by the U. S. Bureau of Mines under the direction
of the Chief Engineer of the Bridge and Tunnel Commissions. The average
pleasure car and trucks of different makes and capacities were tested; loaded
and light, standing with engines racing, with engines idling, accelerating from
rest on a level grade and on maximum grade, and running at three, six, ten,
twelve and fifteen miles per hour. A total of one hundred and one cars were
tested in this manner. Analysis of the exhaust gases, while including all
different components, was mainly centered upon the amount of carbon
monoxide as the one gas that would be most dangerous.
Maximum conditions were found in the case of large trucks moving at
ten miles per hour up grade. These emitted as high as 2.43 cu. ft. of carbon
monoxide per minute; pleasure cars emitted from 1.oo to 1.33 cu. ft. Of all
cars tested, the average number of cubic feet of carbon monoxide per min-
ute was found to be for engines idling, 0.64; engines racing. 1.53; and engines
accelerating up grade, 2.11. These experiments also included determination
of heat produced by the combustion of the gasoline, and considering the
volume of air to be supplied by artificial ventilation, no uncomfortable heat
conditions in the tunnel are anticipated.
Dr. Henderson, of Yale University, was retained to make determina-
tions upon the necessary dilution of exhaust gases to render them harmless.
Some of the main points considered were:
The maximum amount of carbon moncrxide that may be absorbed with-
out discomfort;
The rates at which a person driving a car will absorb carbon monoxide,
and the increase in this rate due to further physical exertion;
The determination as to whether there are other toxic substances besides
carbon monoxide in exhaust gases.
The tests were conducted upon men and animals both with small per-
centage of pure carbon monoxide, ranging from two to ten parts in ten
thousand, and with fixed percentages of engine exhaust.
The conclusion was reached that for forty-five minutes, an ample period
to pass through the tunnel at the slowest speed, carbon monoxide up to four
parts in ten thousand would be harmless even to a person in poor health;
with six parts in ten thousand, there might be occasionally slight ill effects;


THE MICHIGAN TECH NIC
|
with eight parts, the effect was distinctly noticeable. Persons walking absorb
about twice as much carbon monoxide as when sitting quietly. Under ordi-
nary conditions, there is no toxic gas in engine exhaust except carbon
monoxide, and if sufficient ventilation is provided to render this gas harm-
less, other gases will be sufficiently diluted.
Having obtained reliable data as to the amount and composition of
exhaust gases, the necessary dilution to render these gases harmless and the
volume and character of traffic, definite information is at hand for deter-
mining the amount of air that must be supplied to the tunnel at capacity
operation for proper ventilation. The method and equipment necessary to
accomplish this result is still under consideration. Two general methods
have been given detail study:
The longitudinal method in which the entire cross section of the road-
way itself is depended upon as an air duct to convey air through the tunnel;
The distributive method whereby air is supplied to the tunnel through
openings at frequent intervals, leading from a fresh air duct, and similarly
the vitiated air exhausted with a continuous exhaust duct.
The latter method is considered the more feasible because: Fresh air
is supplied to all points throughout the tunnel; there will be no discomfort
from high velocities; ventilation will not be so much affected by moving
traffic or the direction of the wind, and in case of fire, the effect of the fire
can be localized. Studies to date indicate that the ventilation of the tunnel
under all conditions is entirely feasible,—the question of the most satisfac-
tory and economical method to be determined by further experiment
and study.
The late Prof. John R. Allen, formerly of the University^of Michigan,
was retained as consultant on this problem shortly before his death. Since
that time, Prof. Willard, of the University of Illinois, has been engaged, and
is now conducting experiments at Urbana, Illinois. Ventilation of a model
tunnel with automobiles in actual operation will later be undertaken at the
U. S. Bureau of Mines in Pittsburgh.
COST
The estimated cost of the project, based upon prices of the fall of 1919,
is $28,669,000. Tolls will be charged, and it is expected that this cost will
be amortized within twelve years of the time of opening.
One contract has been let for two land shafts on the New York side,
and a contract for two similar shafts on the New Jersey side is now adver-
tised. The river tunnel contracts will be let about mid summer, and it is ex-
pected the tunnel will be ready for operation January 1, 1925.

in Practical Work
B. G. LAMME
Mr. B. G. Lamme is Chief Engineer of the IVestinghouse Electric
and Manufacturing Company. On March i9th, as a guest of some of
the members of the faculty of the Engineering College, Mr. Lamme
delivered a talk in the Natural Science Auditorium. This article is
an excerpt, remodeled and rei-ised, from the material of his address.
—Editor's Note.
There are many things which have
to do with the success of the young en-
gineer in after life which do not ap-
pear to any great extent in the college
course. Many characteristics and
traits are plain to be seen in the col-
lege student, which, although appar-
ently not of importance in his college
work, may have a very strong influ-
ence in his success or failure when he
gets out into the business world. Abil-
ity to make quick decisions, optimism,
a sense of humor, and many other
traits could be mentioned.
The ability to make a quick decision
is a most important trait. Like many
others, it probably is acquired, to a
considerable extent, in childhood.
Moreover, like many others, it is cum-
ulative to a considerable extent. For
instance, if the boy, or young man,
learns to make his own decisions in
the minor matters with which he is
concerned in his earlier years, then he
acquires the practice to a certain ex-
tent, and he will find it easier and
easier to make decisions as he grows
older. On the other hand, if he re-
fers all critical matters to others, then
he will find himself becoming indeci-
sive as he grows older. In active en-
gineering life, the making of impor-
tant decisions is an everyday occur-
rence and the further an engineer ad-
vances in his profession, the greater
the necessity for making them. In
advanced engineering, many of the
new and leading developments are
carried far beyond any existing ex-
perience and data, or, in other words,
the engineers in such development are
dealing very largely with the un-
known. In many cases there is no
real basis for making an absolutely
sure decision, on many of the matters
which come up, but, nevertheless,
someone must take it upon himself to
make the best possible decision, in or-
der to allow further progress. Here
is where decisive ability counts strong-
ly. Some men will decide positively
and quite accurately just what course
to follow, based upon what appears to
be entirely insufficient data. How-
ever, closely related to this is some-
thing else which is usually not recog-
nized as a direct accompaniment of
decision, namely, the ability to con-
centrate along a particular line of ef-
fort, rather than to unduly distribute
one's efforts. I can probably illus-
trate this point best by a little happen-
ing which came within my experience
sometime ago. In connection with a
certain large engineering undertaking,
three quite able men came to me one


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
day with one of the new problems
which had cropped out, and regarding
which they apparently had insufficient
data. In attempting to carry through
this problem to success they had evolv-
ed three possible methods for obtain-
ing the desired result. After very
careful study of these three methods
they were not able to decide which one
to use and they, therefore, came to
me for advice. After listening to their
analyses and explanations I said, —
"Evidently what you want is a decision
as to which of these three methods to
use." In reply to their affirmative, I
stated that I had not yet gone into
the subject very fully myself, but, if
they merely required a decision, I
could make one for them. I said, "I
will toss a coin until the decision nar-
rows down to one method." There-
fore, after deciding in this way which
of the three methods should be used,
I asked them if they were now satis-
fied to go ahead. One of them turned
to me and said,—"I catch the point
exactly. We can now all concentrate
upon this one method and carry it
through to success." "Yes," I said,
"furthermore, I would certainly not
have chosen this way of making a de-
cision, if I had not been sure that any
one of the three methods could be car-
ried through to success, if you all con-
centrated on it. The decision by the
coin was only an object lesson." It
appears to me that this little story il-
lustrates, in a very simple manner,
the value of decision as one of the
factors in ultimate success.
I am sorry to say that very few of
the young men we get from the schools
have, to any great extent, the ability
to make quick and accurate decisions.
I am not blaming the schools for this,
for it is something not taught in their
courses and possibly they have no op-
portunity to develop this trait. Nev-
ertheless it is something that must be
developed sooner or later in the engi-
neer, possibly more than in any other
calling, if true success is to be ob-
tained. A man without the power of
decision is more or less the servant of
others in all the vital things which he
undertakes.
Another trait, which is an absolute
necessity for the engineer, is optimism.
In fact I cannot conceive of an in-
grained pessimist who can be a truly
successful engineer. The optimist be-
lieves a thing can be done and is will-
ing to say so. The pessimist believes
that a thing cannot be done and says
so. Each man tries to live up to his
opinion, that is, to prove it true, and,
in consequence, the result in one case
is success and in the other is failure.
Each has a natural pride in proving
himself right. A pessimist ahvays con-
siders himself a most conservative
man, but, in the engineering field, at
least, it is boldness in conception and
execution which advances the art. To
use an old comparison of mine, pes-
simism may be considered as a brake,
the purpose of which is to retard or
slow down. It does not function to
keep the machinery going or to speed
it up, but it is useful when things are
running away or going down hill.
However, we must keep in mind that
real engineering is very largely up-
hill work, where the brake is of no
assistance whatever. Let us, there-
fore, admire the optimist, the enthus-
iast. He is the one who has the bold
ideas and the "nerve" to see them
through. In times of trouble and
stress in engineering work, it is the
optimist, not the pessimist, who gets
us out of trouble. The pessimist too
often, by his very nature, is a quitter;
and in times of great engineering dif-
ficulties, the last man to put on the job
is the quitter.


Another trait, which usually is not
considered an attribute of real engi-
neering, is a sense of humor, and yet
there is no trait which is really more
valuable to the engineer at times. The
man with a true sense of humor does
not usually belong in the sensitive or
"thin-skin" class, and. in consequence,
he can stand criticism. If you ever
expect to grow, in the engineering
sense, you must expect to encounter
criticism, more or less drastic at times.
This criticism should not be taken as
personal; that is, it is usually criticism
of your work and not of yourself.
You should even go further and recog-
nize that such criticism is simply an
exposition of the other man's view-
point, which may happen to differ
from your own. If he is an older and
more experienced man than yourself,
it should always be borne in mind that
his viewpoint is worthy of very care-
ful consideration. Always remember
that if someone else, with knowledge
and experience, does not agree with
you on a certain engineering matter,
that, at once, brings in the element of
doubt, and such doubt should be clear-
ed away both to your own satisfaction
and that of the other person, before
going ahead finally.
There are two kinds of criticism,
constructive and destructive. Con-
structive criticism is extremely valua-
ble in all kinds of engineering work,
even if the critic proves, in the end, to
be in the wrong, for through such crit-
icism you obtain new viewpoints and
arrive more nearly at the true facts.
Destructive criticism, by which is
meant the kind that tears down but
offers no substitute, is ofttimes of
great value, but usually is not so val-
uable or so instructive as the construc-
tive kind. It sometimes has been said
that destructive criticism is valueless,
but that is not true. A man mav
know, through bitter experience, that
a certain method or scheme will not
work, and yet he may not really know
how to overcome the difficulty. De-
structive criticism, in such cases, is
far better than none at all.
However, it must be remembered
that almost anybody can find fault,
and plain fault finding is most irritat-
ing. It is easier to tear down than to
build up, and, therefore, some people
get in the habit of simply tearing
down, in their criticisms, with no in-
tention of going further in the way
of upbuilding or furnishing useful
ideas. Some of them get into the hab-
it of believing that this is wisdom.
The man, who really goes the fur-
thest in engineering, is the one who
will be the most criticised. There-
fore, I say again that one must be-
come accustomed to accepting criti-
cism or ultimately he is liable to be-
come discouraged. A man who is un-
duly sensitive to criticism and takes it
purely as a personal matter, instead
of accepting it as one method of in-
struction, has no place in a large or-
ganization where the utmost team-
work is required. Such a man had
better get off by himself and do his
own little work in his own little rut,
devoid of criticism; for in many
cases, it is criticism which lifts us
out of the rut or keeps us from get-
ting into it. The sensitive or "thin-
skin" man, as we often call him, is
not only difficult to handle in a busi-
ness way, but often is personally un-
satisfactory. In talking plain busi-
ness matters with people, in an out-
spoken manner, we do not wish to
feel under the necessity of picking and
choosing our words simply with the
object of avoiding hurting the un-
duly sensitive feelings of the person
or persons with whom we are talking.
If he only has a strong sense of hu-


** f
90
mor, one can smooth out his feelings
with an occasional jest or apt story,
so that he will disregard the possible
sting in what went before. As a soft
answer turneth away wrath, so will a
little good humor prevent a possible
hurt. The good-humored man is the
good- natured man, and he is the one
we can all get along with.
New Development in English Engineering
Education
PROFESSOR JOHN AIREY
The writer recently visited an edu-
cational institution which marks a new
experiment in the training of engi-
neers.
The interest centered in the Lough-
borough Technical College, Lough-
borough, England, is distinctly a sit-
uation created by the War. Lough-
borough is a small picturesque town
of possibly twenty-five thousand in-
habitants, situated in the county of
Leicestershire. In 1915 "The Tech-
nical College.' was an incidental insti-
tution of the town—now the town is
an appendage to the college, in point
of interest.
Another three years will be needed
to consolidate its development. Pres-
ent opinions respecting the merit of
the venture are quite divergent in
English educational circles.
Present situation can be made in-
telligible only by a historical approach
going back to 1916. The develop-
ment has been spectacular and due
largely to the personality of Mr. Her-
bert Schofield, the Principal.
This institution was controlled by
the Leicester County Council through
a Board of Governors and, like all
English "Technical Colleges," provid-
ed a technical training for youths be-
tween the ages of 16 and 20, equal or
slightly inferior to our technical train-
ing in fundamentals at Michigan, but

void of the highly professionalized
courses found here. Culturally the
training given by ''Technical Colleges''
is inferior to our Michigan training.
Early in the War all Technical Col-
leges were called upon to cooperate
with the local authorities in helping to
train munition workers. Strange as
it may seem all institutions except
Loughborough fell into the error of
teaching "potted engineering." Mr.
Schofield saw the real need, obtained
30 lathes and trained operators for a
specific operation on a specific shell.
This was all done in close cooperation
with local firms.
This was so successful that the at-
tention of the Ministry of Munitions
was attracted, who took the college
over as a "controlled" institution in
1916. This provided ample funds and
extensions followed each other in rap-
id succession. Evidences are not want-
ing to show the existence of readily
accessible funds in the past.
The type of training given varied
from two weeks to train an operator
for some specific operation to eight
months to train a gauge maker. At
the time of the Armistice the institu-
tion had grown large enough to ac-
commodate 500 people and had al-
ready trained 2.305.
In 1916 the college was styled an
"Instructional Factory" and was or-


ganized with all the departments of a
modern factory including Gauge mak-
ing, Fitting, Turning, Milling, Grind-
ing, Electric Switch and Control Gear
Manufacturing, Tool Setting, Auto-
matic Machine Operating, Smith's
work. Pattern making, Foundry, Cab-
inet Making, Vehicle Manufacture,
Wheelwrighting, Inspection and View-
ing, also Oxy and Acetylene Welding.
Early in 1917 the training of dis-
abled soldiers and sailors was begun.
Before the Armistice slightly over
one-quarter of a million pounds was
spent by the Ministry of Munitions
in building extensions and equipment.
On February 14. 1919, a meeting
of delegates from over one hundred
leading English and Scotch manufac-
turers met in Loughborough and rec-
ommended the continued use of exist-
ing equipment for the education of
engineers.
At present, instruction is given to
two types of individuals: to the "stu-
dent" and to the "trainee." The for-
mer spends five years of which alter-
nate weeks are devoted to shop. The
theoretical training is supposed to be
of university standard (actually it is
somewhat lower). The latter spends
eighteen months in shops only and
the existence of this class is essen-
tially a post-war situation. Evening
classes are strongly featured in the us-
ual manner of Technical Colleges. The
enrollment is:
795 Day Students
IO2I Evening Students
569 Trainees.
The instruction of trainees is obvi-
ously a post-war activity and is of in-
terest to us chiefly in its possible in-
fluence on "student" training. The
type of man constituting the "trainee"
class, also his full time presence, gives
to the shops an atmosphere distinctly
approaching the true commercial shop.
This "shop atmosphere'' is thought so
desirable that attempts are now being
made to secure a continuous flow of
the "trainee" type instead of it being
merely a post-war activity. It is prob-
able that the training of artificers for
the Army and Navy will shortly be
centralized at Loughborough.
The training given to the "student''
class has transcended the usual Tech-
nical College curriculum and prom-
ises shortly to approximate university
standard. The college in five years
has developed from a purely local or-
ganization to more than a national one
as students are being attracted from
the colonies. A campaign is now in
force for the creation of an "East
Midlands University." Loughborough
Technical College would be the engi-
neering unit in the new organization.
TYPES OF EDUCATION
The Principal, H. Schofield, Esq..
M. B. E., B. Sc. (Hons) Lond., be-
lieves that the present training of en-
gineers in England is too highly math-
ematical and technical in fact "as if
every student were a potential high
grade designer." His avowed inten-
tion is to train a "business engineer"
who will already possess the practical
experiences such as one gets in serv-
ing a four or five years apprenticeship
in works. Recognition is freely made
of the pioneering work done by the
Worcester Polytechnic. The writer
can see little in common between the
two institutions except general ac-
ceptance of "construction for sale"
policy.
The importance accorded to the
study of economics is significant and
highly commendable. This study is
strung throughout the entire period.
The time of each student in the
shop is charged in the usual commer-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
cial manner and each student takes
part in the routine work connected
with the posting of time and cost rec-
ords.
The college magazine "The Limit"
for Christmas, 1920, has an article en-
titled: "The Place of Loughborough
in the East Midland University."
"In addition to this failure on the
part of our Engineering Colleges to
come to close grips with Industry, so
far as its productive side is concerned,
there is an even greater gulf between
the Colleges and the Business or Com-
mercial side of the particular Industry
for which the students of any partic-
ular faculty are concerned. What can
we say of these most important
branches of Engineering such as
Costing, Purchasing, Shop Manage-
ment and Organization, Production,
Schemes of Layout, etc. It might be
fairly argued that such sections can
only be taught by those who possess
in some degree the gift of teaching as
well as the necessary technical skill.
With these statements we are inclined
to be in a full agreement, and hence
the existence of Loughborough."
The staff includes some high grade
men. The whole situation is in a state
of flux and we can look forward to
the consolidation of a new type of en-
gineering education. This type prom-
ises to be nearer to that which will
overcome the scarcity of the college
trained engineer in production proper
than is any existing type.
The activities covered are very va-
ried—there is a remarkable "Univer-
sity atmosphere" — more so than at
some of the modern established Eng-
lish universities. The dining hall ac-
commodates 350 people. The four
"hostels" take care of 150 students
and appear excellently managed.
Three shillings per day is charged for
food and 10 guineas per term (three
terms per year) for room.
The college has recently acquired
fourteen acres of playing fields which
have been laid out for most recognized
sports; also a pavilion including gym-
nasium has been established. There
appeared to be societies on everything
almost and they are possessed of an
unusual supply of vitality. There is
an atmosphere of vigorous method and
discipline. An "in and out" board at
the front entrance indicates which
members of the staff are in. Mem-
bers of staff further sign and note
time on entering or leaving building.
All students, trainees and employees
punch clocks.
Recently the governors have grant-
ed permission to wear gown, cap and
hood on receiving diploma; also have
made cap and gOwn compulsory un-
der graduate dress. This development
is unfortunate and premature by two
years. It is exciting the derision of
some institutions.
To summarize, the development of
this institution is a voice of protest,
with which the writer is heartily in
accord, against the over technical
training of engineers. The shop pol-
icy is an interesting experiment. It
may be unjust but one almost suspects
that possibly educational ideals have
been modified by the knowledge that
a large mass of equipment was at
hand.
In regard to general equipment, it
should be added that they are better
fitted for post graduate research in
many lines of engineering than we are
at Michigan.

I V. DAVIES
President, Jacobs and Davies, Consulting Engineers, N. Y. C.
The great war has, with consider-
able reason, been described as a war
of Engineers; and it has, without
doubt, torn the world apart, so that
we have necessarily to stand off once
again, and take a new outlook on our
own affairs, from that which we had
prior to 1914. If it has -taught us
nothing else, it has shown how we
can break away from all precedents,
and strike out afresh with greater in-
dependence of thought and action.
Our present outlook into the future is
tinged with blue, for the simple rea-
son, that our vision is obscured by the
general business depression resulting
from the war. This depression must
soon pass, and then we trust that the
vision ahead will be "couleur de
rose".
To properly judge the future, con-
sider for a moment the outlook from
a point in time so short a distance
back as 100 years, and let each stu-
dent visualize what has been accom-
plished in every branch of the profes-
sion; and then there can surely be no
cause for pessimism. In this period
the work of the profession has be-
come so diversified that it has been
split up into innumerable special
branches; but those branches are nev-
ertheless so interlocked as still to be
inseparable. Civil Engineering was
formerly considered to be the work
of the civilian as distinguished from
the military man but today a very
large part of Military Engineering is
Civil Engineering. For our purposes
we may class civil engineering as
largely that of construction. The en-
tire growth and development of man-
kind are dependent, under our pres-
ent conditions of life, upon the engi-
neer and his works, and no other
branch of engineering can advance
very far without the simultaneous and
co-ordinated activities of the civil en-
gineer. Failing this expansion we
would have to consider ourselves as
stagnating in the conditions which ex-
isted three hundred years ago.
One lesson the war has taught us,
is that the future of civil engineering,
in common with all other branches,
must be carried along hand in hand
with scientific research. We can no
longer carry out our plans in the hap-
hazard rule of thumb ways of past
years if we are to make real progress,
but must go to the foundations of the
sciences upon which the practical ap-
plication of engineering is constructed.
Investigation into the properties of
materials, the laws of earth pressures
and bearing powers of soils, the pro-
duction and storage of power are
merely illustrations of subjects in
which research may revolutionize the
practice of civil engineering.
Could we today obtain a metal
which would combine the strength of
the alloy steels, the weight of alu-
minum and the freedom from corro-
sion of gold or copper, what a revo-
lution would be produced in engineer-
ing design. With the growing scarcity
of coal and oil fuel what new, and at
present unthought of, means for tak-
ing from the sun, from the tides or
from the air, their sources of endless
supply of power, may furnish untold

opportunity for the future of our
work. The railroads some few years
ago came to an understanding that re-
search was necessary to the further
development of transportation; and
now the introduction of the motor ve-
hicle has made clear the necessity for
research into the engineering of high-
way construction, before the present
vast programs for road building by
National and State Governments are
carried out.
The fact, disclosed by the returns
of the past two census, of the marked
growth of urban populations indi-
cates great simultaneous (necessities
ahead of us for the enlargement of
municipal utilities; Transportation,
Water Supply, Sewage Disposal, City
Planning and all the other multifari-
ous needs of urban life.
With the railroads there is a tre-
mendous shortage in new lines and
development, due to the financial con-
ditions of the past decade, which must
be made up to keep pace with the
general growth of the country in its
necessities for transportation. The
further necessity for effecting econo-
mies in all branches of transportation
makes requisite great terminal devel-
opments, reconstruction of existing
roadbeds to keep pace with the in-
creased weight of rolling stock, and
the reduction of the relation of weight
to carrying capacity of rolling stock.
The possibilities of the storage and
recovery of energy in electric opera-
tion of railroads, point to future op-
portunities for the civil engineer.
The great advance in the past 20
years in the art of subaqueous tun-
neling seems to indicate clearly that
extensive use may be made in the near
future of such means for connecting
lines of transportation across water-
ways for both railroad and highway
traffic.
The re-entry, due to the war, of the
United States into a commanding po-
sition in shipbuilding and overseas
trade, must in turn offer wide scope
to the efforts of the Engineer, par-
ticularly if the laws governing opera-
tion of vessels can be so drawn as to
give reasonable, fair and equitable
conditions, both for shipowner and
labor, and thereby foster and protect
the foreign commerce of this country
in competition with other countries.
With the development of the shipping
industry, comes at the same time, Port
and Harbor construction and im-
provement, the regulation of water-
ways, local water transportation,
warehousing and many other lines of
civil engineering work, all of which
must be enormously developed and
expanded.
The re-establishment of trade ne-
cessitates growth of every industry
in the country, which reflects itself
in the construction field, irrespective
of what branch of industry is con-
sidered.
The study and application of eco-
nomics to the construction and opera-
tion of engineering works, is a subject
of vital necessity, and in which the
Engineer must take the most prom-
inent part.
So, through each step of our daily
life, may be seen, to the observant
student, a future of great opportuni-
ties to the Civil Engineer.
The outlook for the future is cer-
tainly one for optimism, just as soon
as the present temporary depression
is past and there has been a re-estab-
lishment of the other nations of the
world, and we ourselves have come
to our normal senses.

The engineer should keep in close
touch with business and banking poli-
cies. The enterprise in which he may
take a part as a technical expert may
be materially affected by subtle eco-
nomic trends. He should particularly
understand those influences growing
out of the expansion and contraction
of bank credit.
Debt has been a stumbling block to
progress in the career of many men,
yet the most successful business men
have usually been large borrowers
during a period of their progress. But,
usually, wise borrowers — not too
much in relation to their own capital,
not with too great a margin of risk,
not too much for the energy and ca-
pacity so necessary to make the bor-
rowed money bear fruit and provide
the means for repayment. A loan for
a well-managed and productive enter-
prise is of value to the entire commu-
nity. Banking policy applied along
such lines makes a nation wealthy. A
loan used for speculative purposes, on
the other hand, developing no means
of repayment, may tend to divert the
borrower or others from productive
work and to make the nation poor.
Borrowed money frequently means
borrowed trouble to the individual,
unless the loan has some legitimate ec-
onomic purpose. A mortgage which
aids a thrifty man to buy a home may
be a blessing; the mortgage, when it
means running behind and is used to
pay the debts of speculation and
waste, may prove a curse.
\o unwise loan, in the individual
case, has any particular effect from a
broad economic standpoint, but a
large volume of such loans have fre-
quently had the effect, in American
finance, of swinging the nation from
prosperity to depression. The indi-
vidual borrower is sometimes very an-
gry when his banker, in view of cer-
tain general conditions, declines to
loan on collateral security, stocks and
bonds. He naturally believes there is
no safer type of loan for the bank, if
properly margined, and has no pa-
tience to listen to a dissertation on the
relation between fixed and fluid cred-
it. He wants the money.
The difference in character between
fixed and fluid credit makes it very
necessary for both bankers and bor-
rowers to thoroughly understand the
relations between the two forms, and
the ultimate effect of their use as in-
struments of banking upon all busi-
ness enterprise, more particularly up-
on the price fabric of the country, and
to all forms of new enterprise.
Credit advances (loans) should be
considered both from the standpoint
of the possible relations to the bank
making the loans, as well as the broad
influence upon the business world of
such loans in volume, made by many
banks.
Correct banking practice is based
upon the assumption that depositors
must always be paid upon demand
(demand deposits), unless their
money has been left on deposit for a
definite period. The bank, therefore,
must be in a position to meet all de-
mands. Experience shows that all de-
positors do not demand the return of
all their money at one time. If they
did, banks could not make loans at all,
95


THE MICHIGAN TUCHNIC
S - *'!

could not pay interest on deposits, and
would be, in effect, merely safe de-
posit companies for the safe-keeping
of money. With the reasonable as-
surance that money will remain on
deposit, in the aggregate, for suffi-
cient time and in sufficient volume,
banks loan their funds to their cus-
tomers in various forms. The com-
mercial banks loan mainly to corpora-
tions or individual borrowers who, in
advance, show a reasonable ability to
pay off the loan in a reasonable time
(fluid credit). Thus, if depositors
should want their money, the banks
have constantly maturing loans which
automatically provide the money for
the purpose, or the credits can be re-
discounted by the local Federal Re-
serve Bank. Loans are thus made by
banks to mature in thirty, sixty, nine-
ty days, or longer, dependent upon the
needs of the borrower and the time of
his probable receipt of funds to pay
his note when due.
The well-managed bank has a large
proportion of its funds maturing day
by day, within a six months' period,
including loans not only due to be
paid by its own customers (dis-
counts), but also by responsible con-
cerns in various parts of the country,
who do not expect a renewal of the
loans when due (commercial paper).
A portion of bank deposits are
cither actually left for a period under
an agreement (time deposits), or are,
in the aggregate, never withdrawn. It.
therefore, becomes possible for banks
also to loan a portion of their depos-
its, as well as their own capital and
surplus, in the form of collateral loans
and in the purchase of high-grade in-
vestments.
In the case of savings banks or
banks with savings departments,
loans are made on bonds and mort-
gages (all fixed credits). Mortgages
usually run from one to three years,
and it may be a hardship for the bor-
rower to pay the entire amount when
due. There has thus developed the
practice of planning partial payments
during the entire life of the loan, not
only developing the habit of saving on
the part of the borrower, but also giv-
ing'something of a fluid quality to the
loan.
Collateral loans, unless the support-
ing securities are due to be paid, do
not, in their very nature, provide any
means of repayment, except through
a sale of the securities. Thus it is
that banks are sometimes compelled
to refuse to make such loans, in order
to preserve the appropriate relations
between the loans based on fixed and
fluid credit.
Banking policy is also controlled by
the economic trends in business and
financial life, as loans in volume, made
or called by many banks, have a di-
rect bearing on inflation or deflation,
the price of securities and the price
of commodities. The proceeds of
loans are credited to the deposit ac-
counts of the borrowers, and depos-
its, in their increase or decrease, af-
fect the spending power of the peo-
ple just as truly as does the increase
or decrease of gold or silver currency,
or the paper money issued by govern-
ments or banks. A growing spending
power increases prices; a lessening
spending power reduces prices.
The basis of credit may thus be act-
ual value of a permanent nature, or
actual value of a fluid or consumable
kind. If money is loaned, it may com-
mand either type of value. It may
promote inflation through increase in
prices by the new spending power of
the borrowers in non-productive en-
terprise and waste; it may, on the
other hand, if properly applied, stim-
ulate the production of new wealth


97
and ultimately tend to reduce prices.
It is often the intention of the bor-
rower on collateral security to buy
more stocks or bonds with the proceeds
of his loan, thus adding to the spend-
ing power of a period of inflation and
serving no economic purpose. Such
tendencies, in the aggregate, ultimately
strain credit, curtail the lending power
of banks, and are first expressed in a
movement to "call loans" in the great
money centers. The inevitable result
is the sale of securities in volume to
pay loans, with the consequent depre-
ciation in prices.
Fluid credit, on the other hand, us-
ually based upon an actual transaction
which will return the money to pay the
original debt, bears a proper price re-
lation to actual business and creates
a stable medium of exchange without
the elements of inflation.
Recent banking practice has devel-
oped large volumes of deposit cur-
rency (checks), based upon fixed
forms of credit, and the use of this
currency has disturbed price relations.
As there is ability, under ordinary
banking conditions, to exchange de-
posit credit for actual money, it is
evident that in using the check drawn
on these deposits, as well as money,
we have a composite medium of ex-
change. Through the loan, deposit
and check process of modern banking,
the proceeds of loans on shares of cor-
porate business, on government bonds,
and on dwelling-houses and other ev-
idences of fixed value, are added to
the volume of basic currency. This has
naturally tended to "bull" the market
—either the stock market, the bond
market, or the commodity market, as
the case may be.
The vast growth of loans since the
beginning of the century, manufactur-
ing deposit currency mainly through
loans on the collateral security of new
corporate enterprises, probably has
been an important element in price
inflation. Business, in the aggregate,
develops its own inequalities—varying
profits, varying losses, under-produc-
tion and over-production—so that, in
connection with an unscientific credit
relation, readjustments are inevitably
necessary. Under the strain of a re-
adjustment period and its forced
liquidation, fluid credit stands the test
and the bank collects one hundred
cents on the dollar. Fixed credit, on
the other hand, represented by secur-
ities, is notoriously unstable and in-
vestments have to be sacrificed to meet
the obligations of fluid credit; hence,
the ups and downs of the stock mark-
et. In this process, banks do not lose
as a rule, but the borrowers do. Out
of these conditions, well-known to men
of experience, comes the banks' policy
in relation to various types of loans.
Paul M. Warburg, in his "Discount
System in Europe," gives this clear
explanation why to make loans upon
fluid credit is regarded as the best
banking practice:
"As a majority of discounts repre-
sents goods in process of production,
or on the way to consumption, liquida-
tion with them primarily expresses it-
self by a falling off in new production,
while the consumer, on the other hand,
cannot stop consuming and must,
therefore, continue to pay. The brunt
(of payment) is thus borne by the
whole nation and adjustment follows
without violent convulsion."
It is thus evident that the lack of
scientific relation between fixed and
fluid credit in banking practice brings
recurring periods of extreme inflation
or deflation, with disastrous effects
upon all forms of business enterprise.
The actual exchange of fixed credit,
or fixed capital, such as bonds or real
estate, is very properly effected


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
through the medium of fluid captial.
The man who buys a house has the
free capital to do it. The seller re-
deposits the amount, and its use as
fluid capital is not destroyed. The
ownership of the fixed capital has
merely been transferred. The control
of the fluid capital has also been trans-
ferred. A large number of such trans-
actions, as during a period of real
estate speculation, particularly with a
diversion of some of the fluid capital
to real estate loans and construction
work, tends to divert fluid capital to
fixed forms. This is also true during
periods of stock speculation coincident
with increasing loans on an advancing
market. Thus it is that many such
banking transactions, innocent enough
in the individual case, as has been
pointed out, are harmful in the aggre-
gate. Such uses of fluid credit not
only disturb the business and invest-
ment markets through the inflation of
value and the increase of prices, but
the actual labor of men, through the
directing power of the dollar, is fre-
quently diverted from productive to
non-productive enterprises. One of
the great panics of the last century
grew out of the use of too much liquid
capital in railroad building.
* * *
It has been shown that under our
present form of banking, fixed credit
may be transmitted into the dollar of
exchange and in volume develop ser-
ious inflation, with the resultant in-
crease in security and commodity
prices. This reacts on the value of
even gilt-edge securities, as high com-
modity prices bring diminished pur-
chasing power from the returns of
fixed interest. Thus the entire price
problem becomes a vital one to the
business world, because of its relation,
indirect but potent, to the stability of
investment values. It is not merely
the question of the value of the indi-
vidual bond and its ultimate payment,
but the effect of the broad movements
of security and commodity values upon
the surplus account of the bank and
the merchant.
All of this means that those active in
all forms of enterprise, cannot afford
to be indifferent to present conditions
and the development of a sound credit
situation. When this has been accom-
plished, there will come into existence
a new credit system which will ulti-
mately serve all the people by the es-
tablishment of more equitable banking
relations. This will give a fairer op-
portunity for the development of busi-
ness enterprise and a consequent pro-
duction of more wealth, with its great-
er investment ability. It will minim-
ize those subtle, yet actual, losses that
come to so many through the insidious
price movements which, In a large
measure, result from the confusion of
fixed and fluid credits.

Compound Stress
PROFESSOR SWINTON
Problems involving compound stress are generally solved by formulae.
Until one becomes very familiar with the solution of such problems there
will be no image or basis upon which results may be checked. The following
graphical solution is given in the belief that it may lead to a general grasp of
the conditions involved in the solution of the equations.
The problems which may be considered are, given the normal and shear
stresses acting in two dimensions upon a particle to find:-~
(a) The planes of principal or normal stress and the values of the stress.
(b) The planes of maximum shear stress and the values of shear and
normal stress thereon.
(c) The planes of shear only (where such planes exist) and the value
of such shear.
(d) The normal and shear stress on any required plane or planes.
In solving the cases it will be necessary first to tabulate the operations
performed in the graphic solution in such manner as to obtain uniformity in
solutions, and second to prove that the results so obtained are equivalent to
those obtained by formula.
To solve for Principal Stresses. (See Fig. 1, Case A).
1. Beginning at the origin O lay off to scale the value of normal unit
stress acting upon the upper side of the square, designated as P.
(Tension down, compression up.)
2. From the end of P lay off the value of the shear stress F horizon-
tally in the same sense as F appears on the lower side of the
square.
3. From the end of P lay off vertically the value of the normal stress
Q acting on the side of the square. (Tension down, compression
upward.)
4. Describe a circle having for its diameter the geometric sum of
P and Q.
5. Through the end of F draw a diameter of the circle (4).
6. The principal stresses are measured upon this diameter, r is the
distance from one intersection of the diameter and the circum-
ference of the circle to the end of F. r1 is the distance from the
end of F to the other intersection of the diameter and circum-
ference.
7. From the origin O draw secants to the intersection of the circle
and the diameter (5). These sectants are parallel to the principal
planes. The values r and r1 act respectively upon planes parallel
to the sectants upon which they terminate.

The formula for solving the above is r=^(P+Q)±^V(P—Q)2+4F2
which may be written ^(P+Q)±\/lA(P— QY+F1. Consider the small
right triangle having for its base F. The height is l/2(P—Q), hence the
hypothenuse is VJ4(P—Q)2+F2. The values of r and r1 are semidiameters
^(P+Q) with the hypothenuse either added or subtracted.
The formula for the slope is Tan 2*=2F/(P—Q). In Fig. i the
angle * is measured by half the arc OT hence the central angle is 2&lt;l&gt; which
is equal and opposite the angle having for its tangent F/^fP—Q), which
equals 2F/(P—Q).
To solve for maximum shear. (See Fig. 1, Case B.)
1, 2, 3, 4. The first four steps are the same as in Case A.
5
The
From the end of F draw a line to the center of the circle,
length of this line is the value of the maximum shear.
6. Draw a diameter perpendicular to the maximum shear (5).. P' is
measured on this diameter from the circumference of the circle
to the center and Q' is measured from the center to the circum-
ference of the circle. It may be noted that P'=Q'=^2(P+Q)
whenever the shear is a maximum.
7. Draw from the origin O secants to the intersections of the circle
with the diameter (6). These secants are parallel to the planes
of maximum shear. Note that the arc OT is 90° greater than
the angle 2&lt;l&gt;, hence the angle 0 is 45° greater than the angle 4\
The plane of maximum shear always lays midway between the
principal planes.
The formula for solving the above is F=^V(P—Q)*+4F2 or
F=\/J4(P—Q)2+F2, which is the hypothenuse of the right triangle having
sides F and J^(P—Q).
To solve for the shear and normal stress on any plane. (See Fig. 1,
Case D.)
1, 2, 3, 4. The first four steps are the same as in Case A.
5. From O draw a line OT having the slope (say 30°) of the desired
plane.
From the intersection of the desired plane OT with the circumfer-
ence at T draw a diameter.
From the end of F drop a perpendicular to this diameter. This
perpendicular is equal to F , the shear on the desired plane, and
the foot of this perpendicular divides the diameter into P' and Q'
the normal stresses acting respectively on the plane OT and a
plane making 90° with OT. Note that P+Q=P'+Q' in all
cases.
No proof is given for the above but it will be observed that both the
original and final set of stresses and shears will give the same principal
stresses, hence being equal to the same thing they are equal to each other.

If we consider the diameter in Fig. 1, Case D, as rotating, and note how
the values ofP',O/ and F' change, the reasons for the solutions for maxi-
mum shear and principal stress become apparent. It will also be clear that
when the end of F lies within the circle there must be real values for P'
and Q' and both must be of the same sign. When the end of F lies without
the circle, as in Fig. 3, the values of r and r' will be of opposite sign and
the values of P' and Q' may or may not be of the same sign. If in the
latter case P' and Q' are of the same sign it will be the sign of the larger
of the original quantities P and Q.
To solve for planes of shear only. Fig. 3, Case C.
1, 2, 3, 4. The first four steps are the same as in Case A.
5. From the end of F draw tangents to the circle. These tangents are
in length equal to the values of shear on the planes having shear-
ing stress only.
6. From the points of tangency draw secants to O. These secants are
parallel to the planes having shear only. There are always two
such planes when the end of F lies outside the circle, one when F
lies on the circle and none when F lies wholly within the circle.
If a plane have shear only acting upon it the plane at 90° will have a
normal stress (P+Q)- Observing Fig. 3, Case D, and considering the vari-
ations that would occur in P',Q' and F' as the diameter is revolved it may
be seen that Q will approach zero, the condition of shear only.
The cuts show solutions for the several combinations of P,Q and F
taken both in tension and compression, one, two, or three at a time. In the
cases where P and Q are equal or F only is given the circle becomes a point.
If a small diameter is assumed, a sketch made, and then the diameter is re-
duced to zero the solutions can better be followed.

EDITORIAL
Events of the past few years have brought forcibly to the
Power minds of the American people their dependence upon the
Conservation production of sufficient coal to provide for their industrial.
commercial, and domestic needs, causing them to look upon
a coal shortage as a national calamity, and to seriously consider a substitute
power which will help to reduce the amount of coal required.
The only practical substitute for steam power is water power. There
are in the country today over 60,000,000 horsepower of undeveloped water-
power. The cost of this power if developed would in many instances be less
than an equivalent amount of steam power, but because of the distance from
markets of many otherwise favorable power sites it will be many years be-
fore all of the available waterpower of the country can be advantageously
developed.

104


A market could doubtless be found for 20,000,000 horsepower of water-
power, which if developed would save to the country at least 200,000,000
tons of coal annually. The total yearly coal consumption in the United States
is about 650,000,000 tons, 30 per cent of which could thus be saved by
utilizing our water resources.
This question is also important from the standpoint of conserving the
world's supply of coal, which though vast is not unlimited. The utilization
of waterpower results in the saving of coal for future use. Waterpower is
unlike most other natural resources in that it is not diminished by use nor
conserved by non-use. Coal which is not used today remains to be used here-
after, but the energy of water which is allowed to flow by unused neither
increases nor decreases the future supply, but is irretrievably lost. In other
words, the real waste of waterpower is its non-use, while its development
effects a conservation, not only of waterpower, but of our fuel supply as well.
It is clearly evident that to protect the country from a possible coal
shortage with its attendant disasters and as an obligation to future genera-
tions, to conserve to the utmost of our ability the coal supply of the country,
the National Government and State Governments should seriously study the
water resources of the country and take steps leading to an extensive devel-
opment of waterpower at all sites where such development is practicable.
This problem should be approached in a scientific manner and preliminary
studies leading to efficient and economical development should be undertaken.
State Universities can assist in this matter in two ways, first by experi-
ment and research which will give information leading to the more econom-
ical and efficient development of waterpower, and second by training students
to leave college with a proper conception of this great problem. Engineers
must not alone provide the technical tools for building waterpower plants
when the opportunity offers, but understanding as they do the vital need of
conserving our power resources, they are eminently fitted to preach this
gospel to others and thus fulfill their duties as citizens as well as engineers.
Graduation is an event toward which we look with the great-
The End Of est anticipation. When that day comes we shall be prepared
The Trail to go out loaded with knowledge and secure in our ability
to earn success. Four years of systematic training have
moulded each graduate into an engineer, a man who should be able to practise
successfully his chosen profession. During the years of undergraduate study,
the embryo engineer never questions the outcome of his collegiate training.
His diploma will show, beyond the shadow of a doubt, his ability to engage
in engineering work. But what is a diploma really worth? After being out
a few months, many graduates have come to realize that the precious sheep-
skin is not so precious after all. Employers do not seem to, necessarily, re-
gard the holder of a diploma the acme of perfection. They have to be shown.
Let us examine the average graduate of a technical school. What does
he knmv? If asked this question the man might reply with a string of
formulas. This man should b° considered the descendant of a parrot instead
of Darwin's monkey. How can he expect to practise engineering success-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
1
fuly? If caught where one of his formulas will not work, he is up against it.
He does not understand the fundamental principles which underlie his work
and he lacks the ability to think straight. After all, if the technical school
can teach these two things, little more can be desired. A man with the basic
principles of his art completely mastered, who can use his head, can solve
any problem which may arise. Learning to think straight can only come
from practice, and the job of mastering fundamental principles often turns
out to be excellent thinking practice. The technical schools are doing their
part. To make graduation, the end of the trail, a really worth while end, is
up to us.
For the last few years, the Technic has, in a small way,
A (ireater carried on a business of supplying the students with part of
Service their required texts. The Engineering Mechanics pamphlets
and the Carnegie Steel Co. handbooks have been the prin-
cipal things sold. The question immediately arises: Why should not the
Technic handle a great many more student necessities, thus developing a
municipal students' store? The available space of the present TecHNIC quar-
ters is scarcely sufficient to meet present requirements and would be entirely
inadequate to take care of demands made by the new store. Even with
normal growth, however, the Technic will be forced to find more roomy
quarters in the near future.
The Technic exists to serve the students of the Engineering College.
The establishment of a student store by the Technic would greatly extend
the possibilities of useful service. Buying in quantity and selling practically
at cost, the prices of books and supplies could be considerably below ordinary
retail prices. Our sophomore class has furnished an excellent illustration
of the saving made possible by quantity buying, in the purchase of their
slide rules. Why should not an organization exist which would render pos-
sible the purchase of practically all student supplies at reduced prices? There
can be no doubt of the need for such an institution. Other schools have run
municipal stores with great success. Let's try it here!
We understand that Tom Lovell is now planning to market a special oil
for our slide rules. This should greatly reduce slide rule errors which are
now so prevalent.
Don't let spring fever get a hold of you too hard. It might prove fatal
about the middle of June.
Wanted: An explanation. Why is there always one man who turns
his bluebook in before we are nicely started? Does he possess a super-intelli-
gence or is his bluebook blank?
Whenever you go out of a bluebook with that satisfied feeling, tap on
wood! You probably flunked it.

NEW EQUIPMENT FOR ELECTRICAL
LABORATORIES
The Electrical Engineering laboratories
recently placed orders for four motor gen-
erator sets and a phase displacement set.
The motor generator sets each comprise a
7.5 horsepower, 230 volt, shunt wound,
direct current motor connected by means
of a flexible coupling to a 5 kilowatt, 250
volt/25o volt compound wound generator.
These sets will be mainly used in the be-
ginning course in "Direct Current."
The phase displacement set comprises
two four pole, 15 kv-a., 1800 r. p. m., 220
volt, 60 cycle alternating current machines,
direct connected and mounted on a com-
mon base. Each machine is provided with
a pulley, a field reostat and a twelve ter-
minal board, the terminals of each of the
six phases being brought out. A spacing
ring in the coupling provides for individual
operation of the machines. Each stator is
provided with a shifting device so that it
can be adjusted through an angle of forty-
five mechanical degrees or ninety electrical
degrees. The field is equipped with an
amortisseur winding. This set will prove
a welcome addition to the laboratory equip-
ment and will be used for a variety of pur-
poses in connection with the course in
"Alternating Current Machinery" known as
E. E. 4.
NAVAL OFFICERS TO RECEIVE
POST GRADUATE INSTRUCTION
The United States Navy has detailed a
selected group of its junior officers for a
course of post graduate study at Annapolis
to be followed by a year of specialized
training at some selected university. The
head of the Post Graduate Department of
the Naval Academy, after considerable cor-
respondence with Dean Cooley, has desig-
nated the University of Michigan as the
school of instruction for powder specialists.
Three officers will report for this work next
October. The course of instruction, as out-
lined, includes much of the Chemistry and
Chemical Engineering taken by the junior
and senior Chemical Engineers. There is
only one new course which is to be offered,
and that is one dealing directly with ex-
plosives. It is believed that the Navy De-
partment selected Michigan for this work
because of the number of its professors
who were engaged in ordnance work during
the war.
ENGINEERS HEAR TWO GOOD
TALKS
On March i9th, B. G. Lamme, Chief
Engineer of the Westinghouse Electric &amp;
Manufacturing Co., and I. N. Hollis, Pres-
ident of Worcester Polytechnic Institute,
spoke in the Natural Science Auditorium

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC

on what is expected of an Engineer by the
world if he is to be successful. Both these
men are eminent in the field of Engineer-
ing and both brought out some very in-
teresting points, a few of which are given
here.
An Engineer must have an imagination
and should not be discouraged by making a
few foolish suggestions because if any one
has very many ideas or makes many sug-
gestions there will undoubtedly be a few
foolish ones among them. A successful
Engineer must be an optimist because in
a group of ten men that he may run across
perhaps three will be offering suggestions
and the other seven will be trying to prove
that these suggestions are no good.
It was also brought out that the day of
the individual leader is past. What is
needed now is cooperation and a good
knowledge of mathematics.
The possibilities for Engineers in other
fields than Engineering was also discussed
and it was suggested that in looking for
the next President we might well turn to
an Engineer.
R. O. T. C. CAMPS
In an address to the students at the Le-
high University a short time ago, the
former secretary of war, Mr. Baker, said:
"As our armies will in all probability always
be those of citizenry drawn to the colors
when the emergency arises, it follows that
the bulk of our officers must also be citi-
zens who leave their civil pursuits already
trained in the habit of discipline and the
principles of leadership. This training and
experience it is believed can best be se-
cured through the military instruction
which can best be imparted in the schools
and colleges."
Keeping up with the trend of times the
University of Michigan has established
Coast Artillery Corps and Signal Corps
units of the R. O. T. C. is establishing an
infantry unit, and will establish an Ord-
nance Corps unit for the coming year.
These units are instructed and adminis-
tered by three officers and six enlisted men.
The University of Michigan will furnish
some seventy-five students, the majority of
whom will attend the camp at Fort Mon-
roe, Va.
Fort Monroe is located on the historic
shores of the Chesapeake Bay where the
students are housed in frame buildings and
have kitchens, dining halls, shower baths, a
first aid station and a dispensary, and a
canteen conveniently located. A Students'
Club, equipped with reading and writing
material, took care of spare time.
Recreation was provided in various ways.
An orchestra from Columbia University and
dramatic talent found in the battalion pro-
vided entertainment within the camp. An
inter-battery baseball schedule occupied the
attention of many. A track meet was at-
tended by practically the entire camp. A
newspaper, "The Recoil," was published by
the students and found favor. Moving pic-
tures and band concerts were popular.
Most popular of all, perhaps, were the
weekly dances held in the Coast Artillery
school. These were always well attended
by the students and by the young ladies of
the Post and of the surrounding commu-
nities.
The camp ended on July 28th. Both stu-
dents and instructors were convinced that
it had been a great success. The health of
the command had been excellent.
The military benefits while real, are not
yet apparent. The measure of success of
the camp of the summer of 1920 will in a
large part rest upon the camp of the coming
summer. All early indi«itions point to a
largely increased attendance and last year's
success will undoubtedly be repeated.
The R. O. T. C. is of vital importance to
the army and to the nation. The summer
camps afford the best opportunity for ac-
quainting its members with service condi-
tions and everything will be done to make
these catrfpslhoroughly successful.
AERONAUTICAL ENGINEERING AT
THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
This course has been the natural out-
growth of the interest for aeronautics in
the University by Professor H. C. Sadler,
head of the department of Naval Architec-
ture and Marine Engineering. In 1910 he


109
organized the University Aero Club, con-
structed a tunnel for experimenting with
various kinds of bodies in an air current
and encouraged the members of the club to
build gliders and study aeronautical prob-
lems.
F. W. Pawlowski, who studied aeronau-
tics at the University of Paris, obtained a
teaching position at the College of Engi-
neering in 1912, with the understanding that
he would be allowed to develop courses in
aeronautical engineering as they were
needed.
Regular courses in aeronautical engi-
neering for which credit toward graduation
was granted, were started with the begin-
ning of the second semester of the acad-
emic year of 1914-1915.
The first three courses developed during
the first three semesters of existence of
aeronautical engineering, known originally
as Aero I, 2, and 3, were properly modified
and included in the present more complete
program of study as Aero 2, 3, and 4, re-
spectively. This program has been in effect
since October, 1916.
The equipment for laboratory work is
still very limited. It consists merely of
facilities arranged for in various labora-
tories of the Engineering College for motor
testing and investigation of strength of
materials and parts of air craft structures.
Also an air current 3 ft. x 3 ft. x 40 miles
an hour, provided by an air blower of the
mechanical engineering laboratory, is being
used for studies of aerodynamical prop-
erties of various bodies by means of a
home-made dynamometer. Certain parts of
the equipment for design work, as drafting
room and such instruments as planimeters,
integrators, battens and weights, etc., are
used in common with marine engineering
students.
Although it cannot be expected that the
enrollment in this course will reach the
proportions of the larger and more compre-
hensive ones of civil, mechanical, electrical,
or chemical engineering, the course has
already become a well established feature
of the University of Michigan. Due to the
inevitable development of aerial navigation
in this country the course will draw more
and more students anxious to enter the
new field of activities.
LIGHT RESEARCH
Investigation has been made, by test, of
the light-transmitting qualities of various
designs of glass skylight such as are used
in sidewalks to illuminate basement rooms
and in the roofs of buildings. For this
purpose a special piece of apparatus had
to be designed and built in order to insure
that the artificial light incident upon the
skylight during the test should be well
diffused as in daylight, and that the total
quantity of light immerging from under side
of the skylight should be measured, not
merely the light in particular directions.
As a result of the test, design-factors
were determined by which the amount of
glass area required in the skylight to pro-
duce the required degree of illumination be-
neath the skylight could be calculated. Fur-
thermore, the influence of certain factors
of practical importance upon the illuminat-
ing value of the skylight were determined
for a few particular cases, as for instance,
the effect of scratching the glass due to
people walking upon it when it forms a part
of a pavement and the effect of whitewash-
ing the under side of the structural frame-
work in which the glass blocks are sup-
ported.
The investigation was performed in the
Photometric Laboratory of the Department
of Electrical Engineering under the direc-
tion of Prof. H. H. Higbie.
ELECTRICAL DEPARTMENT CON-
DUCTS RESEARCH ON INDUC-
TION MOTORS
The Department of Electrical Engineer-
ing is conducting research work upon in-
duction motors. At the present time the
problem being investigated is the action of
these motors upon unbalanced voltages.
The theory of the induction motor oper-
ating normally upon balanced two or three
phase circuits has been well known for a
number of years, but comparatively little
study has been given to the action of these
machines when operating upon unbalanced
voltages. This is a question of consider-
THE ENGINEERING - SOCIETY


THE MICHIGAN TBCHNIC
able practical importance both to the manu-
facturers of these machines and to the
central stations of the country. If a motor
gives trouble almost invariably the first
thing to be done is to measure the voltages
and if it appears that the voltages are not
balanced the manufacturer of the motor
is apt to ascribe the trouble to lack of
balance. It is therefore important that we
have at least an approximate idea of how
much this unbalance will effect the opera-
tion.
It is also a fact that motors are quite
frequently built with a certain amount of
inherent unbalance in windings. This is
particularly true of two phase motors
which are frequently constructed with the
same number of turns in each of the two
phases, but the phases are not exactly at
right angles to one another. We hope to
be able to give an approximate answer to
the question of how much this unbalance
effects the operation.
The problem is being attacked both from
experimental and theoretical standpoints.
Messrs. W. B. Boice, M. N. Brown, K. B.
Kichlu and J. M. Moore are carrying on
the experimental work under the direction
of Professor Benj. F. Bailey. At the same
time the mathematical theory of these
motors is being worked out and the con-
clusions are being checked by the tests
made.
It is well known that the polyphase in-
duction motor has a rotating magnetic
field which is set up by the action of the
two or three phase currents in the wind-
ings. It can be shown mathematically that
in case the voltages are unbalanced we have
the equivalent of two fields, one rotating
ahead, the other backward. It is from this
standpoint that the theoretical investigation
is being carried out. The work has been
under way for some time and presumably
will not be finished until at least a year
from the present time.
PROF. W. P. WOOD REPORTS
RESULTS OF RESEARCH
In the Chemical and Metallurgical Engi-
neering magazine of February 23, 1921, is
an article by Professor W. P. Wood, of the
Chemical Engineering department, on "The
Dimensional Limitation of Successive Heat-
Treatments of Carbon Steel." A number
of experiments were made on samples of
steel containing different carbon contents to
determine the shrinkage produced by suc-
cessive heat treatments. The decrease in
the dimensions of steel parts after heat
treatments has been observed during the
inspection of parts which were finished to
definite dimensions before the heat treat-
ment. It was found by Professor Wood
that as the carbon content of the steel was
increased, the shrinkage after hardening
and drawing decreased. Steel with a car-
bon content below .80 per cent was found
to shrink more after heat treatment than
steel with a higher carbon content.
FORGE SHOP
Owing to increased production of "Spring
Spreaders" in the machine shop, it has been
necessary to enlarge the case hardening
equipment in the forge shop. A cast iron
pot of sodium cyanide kept at a tempera-
ture of 1,600 degrees F. is used, not only
to produce a hard wearing surface, but to
also give a mottled coloring effect on the
spring spreader parts. It is necessary to
operate six four-hour periods per week to
keep up with production.
A gas furnace has been built in the forge
shop to obtain the high temperature neces-
sary in the heat-treatment of high speed
steel, and will also be used to demonstrate
the effect of high temperatures upon the
structure of different kinds of iron and
steel.
MACHINE SHOP
With the beginning of the second semes-
ter several important improvements were
made in the machine shop production
course, chief among which was the intro-
duction of a system known as the students
follow up and production record chart
which works almost automatically, that is,
the students names are put upon a tape and
after each day's work the tape is shifted
one number on the chart so that it gives a
man a new part to make every time he
comes to class.

One of the most important machines that
has just been installed and is now running
is a four spindle National-Acme automatic
screw machine which is being used to turn
out four of the small parts used in the pro-
duction of the automatic spring spreader
that is now being manufactured by the
shops on a production basis. The above
mentioned machine is at the present time
turning out one complete piece every forty-
five seconds which for instructional pur-
poses is fast enough though the work could
be done in about half the time should it
become necessary.
METALLURGICAL SUBJECTS
TREATED IN RECENT PUBLICATIONS BY
MICHIGAN ALUMNI
At the meeting in New York of the
American Institute of Mining and Metal-
lurgical Engineers on February 14th to I7th,
a paper on "Artillery Cartridge Cases" was
presented by Mr. J. Burns Read, and Mr.
S. Tour, who was graduated from the
Chemical Engineering Department of the
University of Michigan in 1916. His con-
tribution emphasizes the need of carefully
prepared specifications for the raw mate-
rial and correct practice in cold working
and annealing brass for cartridge cases.
This is the outcome of the work of Captain
C. Upthegrove when he was in charge of
the Small Arms Ammunition Unit, Metal-
lurgical Branch, Inspection Division.
Considerable discussion has resulted from
the paper on "Nitrogen in Steel and the
Erosion of Guns," which was prepared by
Mr. W. H. Wheeler for the Lake Superior
meeting of the American Institute of Min-
ing and Metallurgical Engineers. Mr.
Wheeler was graduated from the Chemical
Engineering Department of the University
of Michigan, Class of 1915.
The life of a large gun is limited due
to a condition known as erosion. The
cause of the gradual wearing away of the
metal on the inside surface of a gun has
been under investigation for some time.
Lieutenant Wheeler has made a study of
the action of nitrogen on steel at high
pressures. He showed that nitrogen com-
bined with steel, forming a brittle constitu-
ent, and on the basis of his investigation
established a theory that the erosion of
guns was in a large measure due to re-
actions of nitrogen with the metal. Other
papers presented at this meeting of the In-
stitute confirmed the general findings of
Lieutenant Wheeler, but disputed some of
the technical points.
NEW MEMBERS OF STAFF OF
CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
DEPARTMENT
At the beginning of the second semester
two new members were added to the staff
of the Department of Chemical Engi-
neering.
Mr. J. C. Brier came from the Holland
Amline Co. of Holland. Mich. From 1912
to 1914 Mr. Brier held the Acme Fellow-
ship at the University. Mr. Brier gradu-
ated in the class of 1912 and received the
Master's Degree in 1913. During I9i~-I9l8
Mr. Brier served as Assistant Professor in
Chemical Engineering at the University and
in 1918 received the title of Professor in
Chemical Engineering.
Mr. H. L. Campbell who has been Metal-
lurgist at the Industrial Works at Bay City,
Mich., has joined the staff of the Engineer-
ing Department as Assistant Professor in
Chemical Engineering. Mr. Campbell grad-
uated from the Chemical Engineering De-
partment of the University in 1914. At
present he has classes in Chemical Engi-
neering and is assisting in the technical
control of the Engineering Shops.

PHILIPS C. HAYNES WRITES FROM
BOMBAY, INDIA
Dear Dean Cooley:—
Your letter was a most pleasant surprise.
Little did I expect such good fortune.
I am pleased to hear of the great growth
of attendance of the Engineering College.
I do not understand how you manage for
room to accommodate all. Even in my day
we were somewhat crowded, and had to
use rooms in University Hall.
This country with its teeming millions of
many different races affords a great chance
for study. You would find never-ending
interest here. It would take more than a
life time to even begin to know and under-
stand all the people. The Oriental mind
is really different to the Western mind.
Their way of looking at things is a puzzle
to us. One of the chief characteristics of
these people is their religious zeal. Re-
ligion enters into all of the acts of daily
life; and conduct is always determined
thereby. The old Oriental monarchs took
full advantage of this, and customs were
grafted on to the religion of the time for
a definite purpose, generally military, as
in the case of many of the Silch customs.
At the present time, political agitators are
stirring up a great deal of trouble by con-
verting the Peace terms given to Turkey
into a religious problem. We have already
had a hideous murder of a British civil
officer here as a result, and many more are
expected. Gehad (Holy War) is at the
bottom of many murders committed by the
Mohammedans.
As regards the rugs of India: I have
always been interested. These are not what
they used to be. The jail industries are
partly to blame. The general materialism
of the times and the hurry to get rich are
most likely the chief factors. Antiques are
very scarce now in the East. One can find
antiques factories in every country out here.
I know of foundries in Bombay turning
out antiques in brass, and saw how they
seasoned them. The people of the West
are novices in this matter. The experts
are to be found out here, even among the
most guileless looking people. Pearl divers
carry artificial pearls with which to catch
the unwary. I found this out in Arabia.
********
With pleasant recollections of the past,
I remain, with best wishes,
Yours sincerely,
Phiup C. Haynes.

HOW TO WRITE CUBIST POETRY
THESIS IN CUBICAL POETRY 3Z BY A LIT'RY
SENIOR
Few people realize how intricate are the
mazes through which one must travel to
reach this highest degree of literary per-
fection, a degree as Master of Cubical
Poetry (M.C.P.).
The principal requirement in this attain-
ment is the state of the hair. If the aspir-
ant be a man, the hair must be long and
flowing, if a woman, bobbed, abbreviated
and sketchy. This is without doubt the
most important feature. One must acquire
a detached, soulful expression. If one is
naturally insipid, this comes easy, other-
wise to obtain the aforesaid despondency
of the orbs one must have a harrowing
experience, or even better if one can find
the time, to wreck one's life. Your clothes
would always be unusual in design, weird
in cut, and well patched. One must live on
greasy stews served in lowbrow under-
ground retreats, or teas served in highbrow
intellectual rendezvous.
When this mode of life and appearance
is attained, one has merely to think upon
the Freudian complex, nomadness, and pur-
ple pigs, and behold a cubist masterpiece.

HUMOR?
Professor Airey finished the report to
the Dean of his recent trip to England with
the following story:
"Finally, appreciating your serious inter-
est in general levity, I must report that an
interesting London banker informed me
that on his last visit to New York, he had
discovered that the Americans were devel-
oping a sense of humor. I asked him how
he had managed to discover that. He
proved it by telling me a story that he had
heard from a man on Wall Street. A
horse, camel and donkey were discussing
which did the most to win the war. The
horse painted his exploits amid falling
shells in lurid colors and claimed the cov-
eted honor. The camel related his journeys
across arid deserts carrying men and muni-
tions where neither horse nor donkey could
live, and therefore claimed precedence. The
donkey interjected, 'You are both wrong.
I did the most. I bought Liberty Bonds.'"
Little Boy: "Why do they ground tele-
phones?"
Father: "So women can run the gossip
to the ground."
A CHIP OFF THE OLD BOTTLE
Baby: "I want my bottle."
Mother: "Keep quiet; you are just like
your father."
well
WAIT
Mr. Smith: "Is my son getting
grounded in the fundamentals?"
Dean: "My dear sir, I might say that
he is rapidly becoming stranded on them."
DRUNK AGAIN
Clergyman (meeting slightly intoxicated
neighbor): "Drunk again."
Neighbor: "Hie! so am I."
WHAT A PITY
He was big and strong and handsome,
"Just the sort I want," said she.
She was small, petite and pretty,
(What he'd waited long to see).
He was single, she was single,
Heart of each on both was set;
They both dreamed about the other—
What a shame they never met!

What Makes the Firefly
Glow?
YOU can hold a firefly in your hand; you can boil water
with an electric lamp. Nature long ago evolved the
"cold light." The firefly, according to Ives and
Coblentz, radiates ninety-six percent light and only four
percent heat. Man's best lamp radiates more than ninety
percent heat.
An English physicist once said that if we knew the fire-
fly's secret, a boy turning a crank could light up a whole
street. Great as is the advance in lighting that has been
made through research within the last twenty years, man
wastes far too much energy in obtaining light.
This problem of the "cold light" cannot be solved merely
by trying to improve existing power-generating machinery
and existing lamps. We should still be burning candles if
chemists and physicists had confined their researches to the
improvement of materials and methods for making candles.
For these reasons, the Research Laboratories of the General
Electric Company are not limited in the scope of their in-
vestigations. Research consists in framing questions of the'
right kind and in finding the answers, no matter where they
may lead.
What makes the firefly glow? How does a firefly's light
differ in color from that of an electric arc, and why? The
answers to such questions may or may not be of practical
value, but of this we may be sure—it is by dovetailing the
results of "theoretical" investigations along many widely
separated lines that we arrive at most of our modern "practi-
cal" discoveries.
What will be the light of the future? Will it be like that of
the firefly or like that of the dial on a luminous watch? Will
it be produced in a lamp at present undreamed of, or will it
come from something resembling our present incandescent
lamp? The answers to these questions will depend much
more upon the results of research in pure science than upon
strictly commercial research.

THE KREMLIN, MOSCOW
of the famous buildings of the world
are equipped with Otis Elevators
.HE KREMLIN is the citadel of Moscow. The walls of the triangular enclosure
were built in the year that Columbus discovered America. Much of the history of Russia
—a dark tale of intrigue, mystery and bloodshed—was enacted in the Kremlin buildings.
The present Great Palace dates back only to Napoleon's day, for his soldiers burned
the old palace. There are two Otis Automatic Push Button Elevators in the Great
Palace. There is another Otis Elevator in the Nicholas Palace.
This is significant of the world-wide scope of Otis activities. From the first crude
hydraulic elevators to the modern miracle ot automatic vertical transportation, Otis has led
the way and even now is continually developing new and better methods and machinery.

The Nescience of Engineering
By J. T. N. Hoyt
Chief Structural Engineer for Albert Kahn
The above title was suggested because a recent neering is an exact science or any kind of a science,
article in the Technic was called "The Science of
Engineering." It is an error to call engineering
a science, although the language of engineering
mathematics, is an exact science.
The training of the undergraduate engineer con-
sists almost wholly of the mathematical component
of engineering, and therefore he is likely to believe
that engineering is an exact science, and that he
knows it. In fact, if he become a member of that
large group of engineers, the theoreticians, engi-
neering will always be to him an exact science, and
nothing more. This group of wing-footed messen-
gers of the gods never come any nearer to earth
than the top of a mountain range in their flight
through space, spinning on their way their invisi-
ble threads, and having their mortal and immortal
combats far above the vision of man.
There is another group which consists of those
who have abandoned their original belief that engi-
and hold that it is a vast and never-ending series of
laboratory experiments. Their entire career is spent
behind closed doors and drawn curtains, where they
labor under red, green and blue lights, and wave
their magician's wands through unlimited undula-
tions. From such retreats they send forth table
after table of experiments and diagram after dia-
gram of curved lines, which are soon followed by
other tables and diagrams of entirely conflicting
character.
The gyrations of these two groups does not, how-
ever, constitute engineering, which is the "Art of
turning the great sources of power in nature to the
use and convenience of man." To the real engineer,
these two groups are merely two of the sources of
power in nature.
The Real Engineer
The real engineer, having acquired a knowledge
of the mathematics of engineering, must also ac-

quire a liberal knowledge of the sciences and arts,
on account of their relation to engineering; also of
the basic principles of law, in order to determine
facts and the reliability of evidence also of the prin-
ciples of practical gambling.
For in spite of his continually increasing store of
knowledge and his most searching analysis of a
problem, there are always unknown conditions, and
if the engineer will not take a gambler's reasonable
chance, he will find that the curtain has been drawn
down on him and his problem, and the world, im-
patient of waiting for his answer, has gone on with-
out him.
He also finds that although his knowledge of the
mathematics of engineering is essential in the solv-
ing of numerous problems, nevertheless his general
course is guided by no abstruse mathematical theo-
ries, but by the simplest of principles. These may
be ennunciated as follows:
1. A straight line is the shortest distance be-
tween two points.
2. A curved line is the shortest distance from a
given point back to the same point.
3. If the second point cannot be located, it is im-
possible to direct a straigth line to it.
4. If a curved line be directed from a given point,
it is more likely to return to the given point than to
pass through a point of unknown location.
In other words, the engineer will find that most
of the groups of which humanity is constituted are
spending most of their time chasing each other
around circles, and that if he wants to make pro-
gress of any kind, he must go around in circles.
It is, however, a most difficult problem for him
to keep in a straight line. He is surrounded on all
sides by striking examples which conflict with all
of his theories. He finds buildings that are stand-
ing up under loads often exceeding twice their theo-
retical ultimate strength. He finds retaining walls
peacefully reposing against embankments, although
the resultant of the forces falls not only outside of
the traditional middle third of the base, but well out
into the open space in front of the wall. He finds
railroad bridges in which the rivets are stressed in
excess of their theoretical ultimate strength. He
finds foundations of all classes of structure which
were not designed according to his fine-spun theo-
ries of earth pressures, but have been placed at such
a short distance below the surface that it appears
there absolutely must be settlement. He finds em-
bankments standing up at a much steeper angle of
repose than that given in any of his text-books. In
some cases they are standing up at an angle of re-
pose of 90 degrees, when the text books call for a
maximum of 35 degrees. At times he almost loses
faith in the principles which he has so studiously
learned, but then, some engineering failure takes
place which sets him on the straight line again, and
he realizes that the forces of nature are always
present, but at times they are asleep and no one
can predict when they will awaken.
In spite of the difficulty the engineer encounters
in keeping on a straight line, he cannot fail to find
enjoyment in the striking examples along his path
of the nescience of engineering, both in theory and
practice.
New Principles in the Theory of Structures
For the past year or more there has been a mor-
tal combat among the theoreticians over a "New
Principle in the Theory of Structures." The dis-
cussion has covered numerous pages in the pro-
ceedings of an eminent engineering society. Some
claim that the principal is entirely new. Some claim
it is entirely old. Some claim it is an old principle
in new form. Some claim that the principle is not
correct. Some claim that the principle is correct,
but of no use. In this sea of conflicting opinion,
the only course for the real engineer, from whom
the world is awaiting answers to its problems, is to
assume that this principle is of no use.
The subject of foundations abounds in illustra-
tions of the title of this article, forming a never-
ending study of the conditions found in nature.
The first lesson which the engineer receives on
the subject of foundations consists of that Biblical
case wherein one man built a structure of rock,
and it withstood the elements, whereas, another
man built a structure on the sand, and it was de-
stroyed. The engineer must, however, unlearn this
lesson, because he finds that sand makes a very ex-
cellent foundation. In fact, at the short distance
below the surface at which biblical structures were
probably erected, it is questionable if sand would
not form a more enduring foundation, as rock is
subject to disintegration if exposed to the elements,
whereas, sand has already reached its limit of dis-
integration.
The second lesson in foundations occurs when the
engineer is introduced to that eminent authority,
Professor Rankine, who at one time almost domin-
ated the engineering world. Every engineer has
faithfully studied his formulae for earth pressures,
but the engineer must unlearn this lesson also,
for he see foundations established at depths be-
low the surface which would not be permissablc
under these formulae, and he also sees great
loads applied directly to the surface, without
producing any effect on the contours of the same.

Engineers have, however, used this formula for very
deep foundations, but only as a matter of compari-
son, for the unknown condition always enters that
the adjacent surfaces of the soil may not be main-
tained at the same level, or that disturbances may
occur to the soil at a distance.
The first step in the design of foundations for any
structure is to ascertain the conditions of the soil,
and if the engineer depends upon others to obtain
this information for him, he is soon confronted with
a great deal of conflicting evidence. The only safe
method is for him to be on hand when the investi-
gation is made, for he is quite liable to make mis-
takes himself in the evidence and in his judgment,
so why therefore, should he multiply the possibility
of error by allowing the evidence to pass through
the hands of others.
An interesting example of such a case occurred at
a certain building where there was a basement over
the portion of the site, and preliminary borings
were ordered to ascertain the character of the soil,
and the possible presence of water. The reports
showed that there was no water, and the design
was made accordingly. However, as soon as the
general contractor had reached a point about 6 feet
below the surface, a persistent ground water was
encountered which could not be pumped out except
with very powerful pumps. The contractor for bor-
ing was interviewed, and the fact developed that
his principal work consisted in boring wells, and
that water did not mean anything to him unless it
was in the form of a running stream below the
ground. His custom was to wash the samples of
soil out of his tubing with a water jet, and when
he encountered running water below, the water
from the water jet ceased to come to the top, but
flowed away. This did not occur in this particular
instance, so he reported that there was no water.
The evidence in this case depended entirely upon
the point of view of an individual.
Similar cases occur when erroneous evidence is
due to various opinions of individuals as to the
character of the soil; the difference between various
kinds of clay, the difference between sand and grav-
el, and the difference between wet sand and quick-
sand.
Having determined upon the character of the soil,
the engineer's next step is to decide upon its ca-
pacity. In order to assist him in this decision, he
has Rankine's formula which he has probably al-
ready discarded. He has various text-books which
give capacities for the same soil varying about
100%, and in order to properly safeguard these
statements, the text-books usually state that the
only safe method in case of doubt is to make a test
of the soil. The descriptions of these tests are ex-
tremely vague, and the deductions from them still
more so.
The usual method of making these tests is to
make a platform supported by a mast usually I
square foot at the bottom, but sometimes 2 or even
4 square feet. On this platform is piled a load, and
observations are taken of the settlement after vari-
ous increments of the load. Sometimes the bottom
of the mast is placed in the bottom of the founda-
tion excavation. Sometimes a small excavation i
foot deep is made below the general excavatfon.
Sometimes the general excavation is back-filled
around the mast after the same has been placed.
After what is considered a reasonable load has
been placed on the platform, it is allowed to re-
main there for about 24 hours, and if the settlement
is found to be small, the soil is considered to have
a capacity of one-half the applied load, and the
foundation is designed in accordance therewith.
Every step in this process is subject to errors of
unknown magnitude. The safe capacity for the ac-
tual footing of, say, 100 square feet cannot be in
proportion to the safe capacity for one square foot.
The time allowed for settlement, say 24 hours,
might be correct for some kind of soils, but for
others it might be greatly in error. If there were a
soft sub-stratum below, and a comparatively hard
one above, it might be the process of months or
years for the stratum above to gradually sink into
and become a part of the stratum below. The back-
filling of the excavation around the mast might
cause a great difference in the results if care were
not taken to keep the back-fill clear of the mast.
Sometimes the engineer is able to study adjacent
structures and determine upon a reasonable soil ca-
pacity from them. As a rule, however, he will eith-
er not find any adjacent structure of the character
desired, or he will find on close inspection numer-
ous settlement cracks in all of them.
If the soil is manifestly improper for spread foun-
dation, then either piles must be used, or a very
deep foundation. If piles are used, the capacity of
the piles is equally subject to errors of unknown
magnitude as the capacity of the soil. There are
various formulae giving the theoretical capacity,
but these can be used only as a preliminary guidy.
One interesting case was where piles, according to
a well-known formula, showed a capacity of only
8 tons apiece. On leaving these piles over niijht.
and starting driving again in the morning, the piles,
according to the same formula, showed a capacity
of 72 tons apiece. This variation indicates a great
error in the formula. It is well known that if piles
are allowed to rest, the soil will settle around them
and increase their capacity, but it is beyond all rea-
son to believe that the capacity should be increased

from 8 tons to 72 tons by a rest of only 12 hours.
Thus far, the process of designing a suitable
foundation has not been guided in any sense by
science.
The following interesting incident may well be
related here : An eminent engineer was designing
foundations for a building on a distant site and or-
dered borings made. In order to facilitate the hand-
power turning of the augur, the workmen poured
water down the hole as they proceeded. The soil
samples sent to the engineer therefore showed a
soft, wet clay, and the engineer ordered wood piles.
On visiting the site, after the building was well
under way, he found it located on a hillside, on a
bed of hard, dry, blue clay.
Noticing a pile-driving operation going on in the
immediate vicinity for another building, he made
inquiries and found that the engineer for that build-
ing had visited the site of the first structure, and
having found that such an eminent engineer had de-
cided on the use of piles, determined no further in-
vestigation was necessary, and merely followed the
example of the first engineer. The owners of the
building in each case paid the bill for the piles.
In case it is decided to adopt the deep foundation,
there are still more uncertainties. If there is rock
at a reasonable depth, it becomes necessary to de-
termine the advisability of reaching that rock. This
situation was well illustrated by the first deep foun-
dations provided for a high building in the City of
Detroit. The engineer started the deep foundations
with the intention of going to rock at a depth of
126 feet. After several foundations had reached a
depth of 118 feet, water and gas came into the bot-
tom of the excavations, and killed two men in one
excavation by asphyxiation. The water rose in the
excavations and overflowed into the basement of
the building, which showed that it had a head prac-
tically equivalent to the river level. The engineer
at once abandoned all expectation of reaching rock.
He filled the excavations already made with con-
crete up to a height of 90 feet below the curb, which
was sufficient to keep the water from running into
the bottom. He then built a projection extending
several feet around the outside of the foundation,
which was circular in form, and as the foundation
went up he built three more such projections. All
the other foundations were built in a similar man-
ner. The foundations for this structure, which
were started with the intention of going to rock,
ended in a design which somewhat resembles a
Chinese pagoda in form, with the projections bear-
ing on the soil at different levels. Exact science
played no part in the evolution of this type of foun-
dation, nevertheless it has proven successful. In
spite, however, of its success, it has been violently
attacked on several grounds, which shows that en-
gineers do not always accept the most reliable evi-
dence as convincing.
It has been criticised because the bearing is not
all at the bottom, but at varying levels. It has been
stated that this is not only unscientific because ac-
cording to Rankine's formula the soil has different
values at different levels, but also that it is imprac-
tical because a sufficient bearing cannot be obtained
at the levels above the bottom, as the soil will be
too much disturbed during the operation of build-
ing the foundation.
The Foundation of Hotel Ponchartrain
Another interesting example of a foundation
which ended differently than it started is that of

the Hotel Ponchartrain in Detroit. The founda-
tions were intended originally to be the ordinary
type of spread footings. After the general excava-
tion was well under way, the sides of the excavation
and the adjacent buildings began to cave in, and the
bottom began to rise. The pavement in the adja-
cent streets settled. In order to determine the char-
acter of the soil below, borings were started, but it
was impossible to carry them to great depth on ac-
count of the pressure and water and gas encoun-
tered. It was finally decided to adopt wood piles
to be driven very closely over the entire site, and
to be covered with a heavy concrete mat. Very
heavy concrete enclosing walls were to be built en-
tirely around the basement and sub-basement. In
order to determine the capacity of piles, several test
piles were driven which varied in capacity, accord-
ing to the usual formula, from 16 tons to 21 tons.
A capacity of 15 tons was adopted, and pile driving
started. After pile driving was well under way, it
was noticed that during the driving, the piles pre-
viously driven would rise. This continued until the
end of the operation the amount of such rise vary-
ing from 6 inches to 24 inches. An attempt was
made to drive the piles down to their original posi-
tion, but this proved impractical because when a
certain pile was being driven, it would cause the
others around to rise still higher, and also the driv-
ing was very difficult. Not having any other choice,
the engineers decided to cut the top of the piles off
at the original level and not make any further at-
tempt to drive them down.
In this connection, it may be said that some en-
gineers hold that the compression of the soil due to
driving piles close together will not endure indefi-
nitely, but that the soil will resume its natural con-
dition eventually, the pressure at the bottom of the
piles being less than that between the piles.
In spite of the uncertainties encountered during
the construction of this foundation, it stood, and
supported the structure above for 17 years, without
any settlement. This foundation would have been
ample to support the new tewnty-four story struc-
ture now being built on this site, if it had not been
that most of the columns are in different locations
and considerable additional expense would have
been required for steel grillages, and also because
there is an additional wing in the new building, but
principally because it was desirable for such a high
and important structure to have a foundation car-
ried to a much lower point below the surface. Dur-
ing the construction of the new foundation, some
of the old piles were removed, requiring a pull of
60 tons to pull each pile, which shows that the orig-
inal assumed capacity of 15 tons could have been
greatly increased. The foundation adopted for this
building is the same as the deep foundation above
described.
The history of other subjects of engineering
might be reviewed if the limit of length of this ar-
ticle had not been reached.
The intention of this article is not to convey the
impression that engineering projects are as a rule
very likely to be unsuccessful, for the contrary is
the case—they are successful in the large majority
of cases, and where failures occur, they can nearly
always be traced to the lack of observance of the
most fundamental truths. The purpose of this arti-
cle is to show that engineering is not a science, but
an art.

Professor Raymond Walters of Leigh University
has made an investigation of high scholarship and
its resulting effect upon a man regarding his stand-
ing in the engineering world.
The report shows that of 392 distinguished engi-
neers 46.4% graduated in the highest fifth scholas-
tically of their classes; 27.8% in the second fifth;
18.3% in the middle fifth; 3.6% in the next to low-
est and 3.8% in the lowest fifth.
Of 730 listed distinguished engineers 80% were
college graduates; 16% secondary school graduates
and less than 5% started in college and did not
finish.
The arbitrary basis of eminence in the study of a
professional group was taken to be the holding of
office, membership in important committees and
service as representatives of the four founded engi-
neering societies, civil, electrical, mechanical, and
mining and metallurgy for five years 1915-1919.

The Engineering Society
By George Gregory, President
Every man who has been in the Engineering col-
lege for a year or more is fully aware of the wonder-
ful spirit which is apparent in our college. One can-
not help but become engrossed by the good-fellowship
which exists, undoubtedly, to a higher degree in our
college than any other in the University. It is this
spirit which everyone of us engineers is duty bound
to maintain. The chief agency in doing this is the
Engineering Society, which is the only organization
that gives every engineer an opportunity to become an
active member.
It is up to us to maintain the Society at its previous
high standard. The standard that was set for us many
years ago by men who have since become the captains
of many industries. I, personally, believe that it has
grown to such a size that it is impractical for the so-
ciety to be a strict technical organization. It should
be the mother society of all the branch societies of the
college, leaving the branch societies to carry on the
technical work in their own respective professions, and
becoming in itself a large social organization. It
should give entertainments of various kinds where the
students will be able to meet their classmates in a dif-
ferent way than is possible in the classroom. The
Society will attempt to have speakers of national re-
pute address the students on general subjects. The
intention of the officers of the society is to have an
entertainment of general interest every six weeks of
the school year of 1921-22. Thus we will have the
opportunity to become better acquainted without inter-
fering seriously with our other duties at Michigan.
The members of the society have a right to expect
a material benefit from their membership. The offi-
cers are now attempting to work out a plan with engi-
neering supply houses to furnish slide rules, drawing
instruments, etc., at cost, thus enabling the members
of the society to effect a considerable saving in the
purchase of such supplies.
Committees have been appointed and a program will
shortly be announced for the year. However, The
Engineering Society cannot hope to be a great success
this year unless it has the cooperation and ideas of
every student.
The X-ray is being used to detect internal knots,
rosin pockets, cracks, etc., in timber, the detection
of which is important in that to be used for pur-
poses where freedom from such flaws is desirable
or essential. This method can be used on timber
up to 18 inches thick.

By Bernard L. Beckwith, '21
Much has been written in the various magazines
and technical papers about the general subject of
South American prospects, yet the young engineer
is much at sea when he seeks a reliable basis on
which to prepare himself previous to going down
to his field of choice in South America. The diffi-
culty is an inherent one: South America offers such
a large and varied field, conditions are so very di-
verge that it is an impossibility to make an analysis
which could cover the entire territory adequately.
A man going into work on the Brazilian coast cities,
in Uruguay, Argentina or Chile would find himself
in surroundings very similar in many ways to those
in this country. On the other hand conditions in
the interior and in the northern countries are most-
ly of a very primitive nature; transportation facili-
ties are either poor of non-existent and any indus-
tries or mining are therefore carried on by primitive
methods. A large proportion of Bolivia, for exam-
ple, capable of large development, is at present
served by mountain trails only, not even wheeled
traffic being possible for connection with the coast.
Work in such parts will call for a good physical con-
stitution and for rugged outdoor camp life in min-
ing and construction work.
In the more developed parts of South America,
such as the Brazilian coast, Uruguay, Argentina
and Chile, all modern conveniences are usually to
be found and many industries established. Good
transportation systems have been built up, and the
young engineer will find considerable competition
in the profession from both native and European
engineers. However, much work has to be done in
the way of port works, sanitation developments, in-
dustrial works and there is no doubt that large en-
gineering firms will find plenty of work in the near
future as soon as the necessary capital can be ob-
tained. During the war period all engineering con-
struction practically ceased, and plans held in abey-
ance during that time will mean extra work when
constructions can be commenced.
South America Is Not a Gold Mine
Now as to the young fellow planning foreign
work in South America as his choice: there are
some points of fundamental importance which
should be first decided. These are:
1. That a man intending to go into foreign work
must in general make that his life choice, that is,
he must decide to make his permanent residence
during his working life, at any rate, in the foreign
country. It is a waste of opportunity to go out of
the country for a few years and then return to work
in the United States; a man is of more use to his
Company in the surroundings in which he has gain-
ed his experience, and his returning is usually not
encouraged and means a secondary job if he does
insist. I do not refer here to the man who goes for
a year or so merely for the matter of experience of
foreign travel and education — that is a different
matter entirely.
2. That South America is no gold mine — hard
work and good brains are just as essential to suc-
cess there as anywhere. The days of the Spanish
El Dorado are at an end, and nature's laws of exist-
ence do not recognize international boundaries. It
may seem superfluous to mention this, but it is nec-
essary to correct some current impressions.
3. That a man must be ready to acclimate him-
self to a different type of civilization and customs.
There are many young fellows who become utter
failures because they attempt to play the "high-
brows," to use an expressive term, in their dealings
with their Latin brethren. This is a fault too char-
acteristic of the Anglo-Saxon for a man to ignore.
Much of the misunderstanding between the Anglo-
Saxon countries and others are due to this fact
alone. The engineer has to deal with men, and un-
less he can command their respect at all times, he
rarely will succeed.
4. That unless an engineer has the capital and
experience to go into work on his own, it will be
necessary to go to South America on a contract for
two or more years. Otherwise a man may find him-
self stranded without suitable occupation and with-
out experience in South American practices and
methods.
Attractive to American Investors
It will be found that in most South American
countries, particularly on the East Coast, that the
British have had a long start in the business.
While the United States has been developing its re-
sources within its own borders, Great Britain has
(10)

found a good outlet for her excess capital in the
development of South America. Today she owns
and operates most of the important railways and
public utilities, and therefore it will naturally be
found that most of the engineers employed by those
companies are Britishers. However, the United
States today has a large amount of capital avail-
able for foreign investment, and it is not unlikely
that the near future will see American investors go-
ing into engineering developments in South Amer-
ica, where the settled conditions as compared with
those in Asia and Africa will prove attractive to the
more conservative capitalists. Therefore as regards
future work it is probable that the American engi-
neer will have the advantage which his British cous-
in has now as regards established enterprises.
Not long ago I wrote an influential railway me-
chanical engineer for some data as to the prospects
for a young graduate in Argentina, the particular
field in which I am interested. His remarks I be-
lieve are of interest and carry the weight of his ex-
perience and knowledge, and I shall therefore trans-
cribe parts of them:
"As for future prospects, regarding which you
ask my opinion, it is difficult to express them; but
it seems to me that some experience in an engineer-
ing firm in the commercial side would be a valuable
finish to your technical education. Not so interest-
ing from the purely engineering point of view, but
quite necessary. The U. S. A. seems inclined to
cultivate commercial dealings with South America
and with the present conditions in Europe it looks
as if the latter dame will be too busy at home for
a good while. As for what special line you could
take up if you decided to put in another year's
study, it is again difficult to say. Chile is putting
down iron and steel works to manufacture from
home ores and Brazil is doing the same. As you
know, here (Argentina) there is much agitation for
the development of our iron and coal fields. There
is indication of iron and coal in several places, and
though the latter has proved to be of poor quality
it could well meet the competition of imported coals
if used in pulverized form. Oil certainly exists—
the last bore put down by the government at Com-
odoro Rivadavia proved to be a gusher. Oil has
also been found in Neuquen in the southwest, in
Mendoza in the west, and in Jujuy in the north.
Transport difficulties have so far prevented any at-
tempt to develop these important fields.
Room for Men Who Can
"With regards to iron and steel, the Vasena and
other companies in Buenos Aires are doing quite
big jobs at present. Vasena has put down a rolling
mill to work scrap into bars and shapes. They are
also doing a good deal in the way of steel work for
buildings, roofs, etc. There are firms doing steel
casting work in Buenos Aires and these lines will
no doubt develop rapidly and are ones which your
education would fit you to take up. The field is
varied and suitable technical men are needed. A
lot of young fellows have come out from England
after doing their "bit" in the war, but many of them
don't seem inclined to work much, and there is
plenty of room for men who can work and want to,
to forge ahead. ... So far as railways are con-
cerned, electricity is pushing its way forward, for
motive power. In the workshops and in smithy
and foundry work oil fuel is coming to the fore. In
our works we already have a number of oil furnaces
for faggotting our scrap. The available oil fuel will
probably lead to the extended use of Diesel enginees
and similar types as motive power for the supplies
of the smaller towns. Some of the big Buenos
Aires firms keep a technical staff and undertake es-
timates and plans for such installations for small
towns and large estancias (ranches) ..."
This gives a picture of actual conditions for Ar-
gentina. A similar description may be had for the
other countries of South America, and Central
America by writing to the Pan-American Union,
Washington, D. C., which has a special staff of ex-
perts prepare commercial reports on the various
countries.

Model of Flow Regulator for Irrigation Canal
In the construction of the ordinary irrigation pro-
ject, the canal for conveying the water from the
source to the land to be irrigated has no artificial
lining—it is simply an earth canal. It is also a min-
imum cross section. It is, therefore, desirable to
maintain such a velocity in the canal that the flow-
ing water shall not scour the sides or overflow the
banks.

Our problem was to divert the water from a
stream into a canal and maintain a uniform flow.
We erected a diverting wier across the stream, and
at right angles to the wier, head gates, which under
ordinary flow in the stream would allow the desired
quantity of water into the canal.
We chose for our purpose the installation of a
siphon wier or spillway. By studying the accom-
panying sketch you will get some idea of the con-
struction of the siphon. We had to find some means
to draw the air from the siphon and thus start the
flow. We resorted to a venturi tube. This tube
was made 13 inches long varying uniformly in diam-
eter from 3/16 to 9/16 inch. A small tube was
tapped in at the end of the least diameter. The oth-
er end of this tube was injected into the top of the
siphon. Water flowing throughout the venturi tube
actually sucks air through the small tube tapped
into it.
The entire model is constructed of wood except
the venturi tube, which was worked from sheet
brass around a spining core much in the manner
used in making fine tubes for band instruments.
The canal and river are made of 5-inch matched
flooring. Great care was taken throughout to make
the structure water tight—especially in making the
siphon spillway, the operation of which depended
upon our ability to build it air tight. The structure
is a highly efficient model of a practical project and
offers all, in miniature, that could the actual struc-
ture.
This model was built by students under the direc-
tion of Prof. Wisler.
A Water Japan
A water japan for japanning metal parts of auto-
mobiles and innumerable other objects has been in-
vented which eliminated the danger of fire and ex-
plosions incident to the use of japans in which some
inflammable solvent is used, during the baking pro-
cess.
This water japan, as it is called, is an emulsion of
the asphalt oil base with water, in which infinitesi-
mal particles of the base are held in suspension in
the water instead of being dissolved in it. It was
found that this japan had no tendency to settle,
even after months of storage, and that, owing to
its being suspended in water, losses by evaporation
were practically negligible.
The methods of applying the japan are two in
number—the electric dip, and the hot dip. The for-
mer is appropriate for small articles, and consists in
placing them, charged positively, in a negatively
charged iron tank of japan. The result is that an
even, smooth coating of japan is deposited free from
articles, and since the japan is deposited free from
solvent, there is no resultant drip when the lot is
conveyed to the baking ovens.
The second method, or the hot dip, which is ap-
plicable to large pieces of metal, was found more
or less by chance. It had been the custom in the
laboratory to preheat the metal before dipping, in
order to free it from dirt and grease. This preheat-
ing evidently had the same effect of causing the
japan to form a deposit on the metal as giving it a
positive electrical charge. A third method is also
sometimes used which is a combination of the two
already mentioned.
Two new wireless stations have been established
at Helsingfors, Finland, which will provide radio
communication with all central Europe. Hereto-
fore Finland has had but one 3-kw. wireless station,
the range of which did not extend much beyond
Copenhagen, Denmark.
Self-Propelled Boats Built for N. Y. Barge Canal
It is a far cry from the Erie Canal to the present
Barge Canal of New York State, and just as far
from the mule-hauled canal boat to the latest type
of self-propelled barges which were recently built
on the Barge Canal.
These barges, five in number, were built in Du-
luth, and will be propelled by 140 brake h.p. direct
reversible Diesel engines. They are 250 feet long,
36-foot beam, lo-foot draft, with a displacement of
2,150 tons each. The cargo capacities range from
1,500 to 1,750 tons each.

The United States and Canada will be linked
more closely together in the future. The bond this
time is to be of steel. Steel in the form of an in-
ternational bridge between Detroit and Windsor,
to be finished in 1926.
Details of the structure have been complete for
some little time and work on the bridge approaches
was started about August first. It will be late in
the year, however, before an appreciable number of
men are put to work. Charles Evan Fowler, chief
engineer of the project, estimates that it will be
four years from the time that the excavation job
is started until the date of the formal opening.
To be Longest Bridge in World
The bridge will be of the suspension type, closely
resembling the Williamsburg bridge, New York.
The main span will be 1,803 feet long and it will
be, at the highest point, 115 feet above the water.
Two side spans will each be 925 feet long from the
center of the towers to the face of the anchorage.
Mr. Fowler states that this will be the longest and
heaviest bridge in the world.
The two towers from which the cables will be
strung are nearly 400 feet high and will rise ap-
proximately 150 feet above the First National Bank
Building, Detroit. These towers are to be made
up of four rectangular columns, which will be some-
what larger in cross section at the point where the
decks pass thru the tower than at the extremities.
Foundations upon which the mammoth supports
will rest will be sunk to bed rock, a. depth of 100
feet by the penumatic process. The main piers are
to be 50'xi 30' and made of concrete topped off
with 18 feet of granite courses starting at a point
about seven and a half feet below the surface of
the water.
There are eight supporting cables to be held by
the towers. Six of these will be 21 inches in diam-
eter and the other two 18 inches. The two 18-inch
cables are to be composed of 19 strands each con-
taining 300 No. 6 R. G. (0.192" diameter) galvan-
ized steel wires. In the larger cables there are to
be 19 strands each containing 420 No. 6 R. G. gal-
vanized steel wires. The total number of wires in
each cable of 18 inches in diameter amounts to
5,700 while in the 21-inch cables the total is 7,980
for each. The wires will be strung one at a time
until the eight cables are completed and then wound
with soft galvanized steel wrapping wire. The im-
portance of the cables may be judged from the fact
that at least eight months will be required for their
construction.
(13)


T E C H N I C November, 1921
MICHIGAN

For the 2i-inch cables each suspender is to be
2 galvanized steel wire ropes i% inches in diame-
ter. For the 18-inch cables the suspenders will be
wire ropes ij4 inches in diameter. These will sup-
port the two decks of the main span of the bridge.
On the upper deck it is planned to have two 28-foot
roadways, two 7-foot sidewalks both of which will
be paved with concrete. Double trolley tracks will
be laid thru the center of the deck. The railroad
deck will be fitted with four tracks but it is probable
that this deck will not be constructed for two or
three years after the completion of the highway
deck. The approach to the highway deck will ex-
tend half a mile inland and will have a grade of 4
per cent. The railroad approaches will extend in-
land one mile on each shore and have a grade of
one and one-half per cent.
The amount of material that will be used in this
bridge is amazing. There are to be 6,000 miles of
cable and 50,000 miles of wire, quite enough to tie
a double hitch around the world. The steel if made
into cable wire would reach to the moon and back.
There will be required 5,000 cars to haul the steel,
or about 100 train loads. There will be about 40,-
000,000 pounds of cement and about 8,000,000 rivets.
On the bridge there will be about four miles of road-
way, four miles of sidewalk and twenty miles of
track.
To Cost $30,000,000
The enormous cost of construction, which has
been estimated to be in the neighborhood of $30,-
000,000, has necessitated a careful study of the traf-
fic volume from which revenue must be derived. It
would be unwise for any company to plan such a
project without having some assurance that the in-
crease in traffic would warrant such an investment.
Mr. Fowler says in this respect that within one
year after the bridge has been opened the automo-
bile traffic will have increased six-fold and the foot
and trolley traffic two-fold. It is estimated that for
the first year the gross earnings will be 10 per cent
of the cost of construction with a steady increase
in the percentage thereafter. The tolls have been
arranged as follows:
Foot passengers, 5 cents.
Street car passengers, 2^ cents.
Motor cars with two passengers, 30 cents.
Each additional passenger, 5 cents.
Trucks with load up to two tons, 50 cents.
Each additional ton, 25 cents.
Freight cars, $2.50.
These tolls will be collected at toll stations located
at the end of each span, near the three-story fire-
proof buildings for customs and immigration offices.

Editor's Note:—The following article is an ex-
tract from an address delivered by Mr. Hale before
the Society of the Sigma Xi at Purdue University.
The full text of this address can be found in the
Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.
Both university men and industrial men have de-
picted many essentials necessary for the success of
young chemists. A good rigorous training is al-
ways to be encouraged for those who seek a chem-
ical future. Further, if we start this training in
early childhood, all the better; simple thinking with
clear deductions makes for better faculties in later
days. Our elementary schools and high schools
may stimulate the scientific spirit when once arous-
ed but more than likely they will not, amidst the
deluge of diversified devotion to things utterly for-
eign to mental advancement. Thus, a mathemati-
cal course easily surpasses in value the sum total
of all other subjects taught in our schools; no mat-
ter whether scientific or unscientific be the student's
interests, his mental makeup is incomplete until he
has had this training. During my experience in
teaching, I found the greatest number of freshmen
more deficient in this field than in any other. Of
course their use of English is pathetic, but this
slowly improved through influence of educational
environment. As a result, I have become thorough-
ly convinced that mathematics makes for the great-
est good to students of our primary and secondary
schools. How far they should pursue this subject
in college and university naturally will depend on
their future aims in life. Let us grant then without
argument that a rigorous early training constitutes
a firm foundation for the best chemical training at
the university.
The young men of the universities pursuing
courses in chemistry or chemical engineering have
commanded, next in order, the chief attention of
our many lecturers on this general subject. Some
have told us of the advantages accruing from a
purely scientific course of study; others have told
us of the immense advantages which fall to those
pursuing a more utilitarian course, such as chemical
engineering. I shall hesitate here no longer than to
remark that little difference does it make what course
a young man takes so long as he knows well the
fundamental principles of his science, and cognate
sciences and can readily apply this knowledge when
occasion demands.
The great majority of young chemists graduating
from universities select some position with an in-
dustry where chemists are essential or nearly so.
In those instances where the "nearly so" variety
obtains, you may consider the young chemist as
acting in all capacities at once. In general, how-
ever, the young men are placed directly in the re-
search divisions or in the analytical laboratories.
The varied training of these chemical neopyhtes
forbids any serious discussion as to just what they
are best fitted for. They occupy, so to speak, the
same relative position as freshmen entering college.
Though the proverbial rough edges and apron
strings of the verdant freshmen are long since re-
moved, there have appeared anew certain oddities
in our graduate which now must be corrected, such,
for example, as the experimental niceties, the more
or less sanctioned professoral customs of procedure,
and the textbook overdrapes. The first condition is
soon remedied when he finds himself working in
vessels too large for the fine balances; the second
is removed more slowly but decidedly so, when he
comes to realize that complexities now enter into
analytical studies which never were dreamed of by
his instructor. The third, like some heavy fog, van-
ishes before his eyes as he comes to learn how ut-
terly unfamiliar with actual conditions the average
textbook writers appear to be.
After all, the great majority of young chemist
graduates have made good impressions and many
have succeeded even where least expected. During
the past few years, or since the discharge of a large
body of near chemists.who had been assembled at
Washington for the purpose of research, the indus-
tries have become flooded with this second-grade
material. True, many real chemists were in the em-
ploy of the Government, but by far the greater num-
ber were decidedly of inferior grade, and this is the
. lot which was recently foisted on the industries

looking for positions as chemists for no other rea-
son, apparently than that they had been given that
particular nom de plume in Washington. Though
their researches seemed childish in the eyes of ac-
tual chemical manufacturers, nevertheless employ-
ment was given without undue criticism. Months
have now elapsed and you will find these same
young men almost completely transplanted into va-
rious forms of non-chemical enterprise. They soon
came to realize that nature had never intended them
as chemists.
The need for chemists was never so keenly felt
by our chemical industries as in the past few years.
Though the poorly trained chemists and near chem-
ists just mentioned have slowly been eliminated,
those who remain have shown far too clearly a lack
of that broader training so highly desirable. I do
not wish to be overly critical of our young chemists,
but I do not exaggerate when I say that the large
proportion of chemical graduates have proved in-
effective in the prosecution of research. As anal-
ysts, however, these young men have qualified ad-
mirably. Possibly the industry expected too g; eat
a storehouse of knowledge on the part of the young
graduates, but would not you suppose that these
young graduates could at least delve into a subject
and search the literature for themselves? This docs
not seem to be beyond the realms of possibility, b\iz
do we find thi..&gt; type of student? The answer is de-
cidedly in the negative. There remains, therefore,
but a narrow field for his employment; more likely
he is given the icpetition of work outlined Ly oth-
ers, usually from the patent literature, and lett to
drift. How many laboratories this past year or two
have done anything beyond working over a scries
of German patents? Results they all obtain, of
course, but of what intrinsic value are they? The
enterprising industry really wishes far more than
this, and must needs know the basic conditions of
each and every problem which primarily adapts it-
self to that particular industry and which will per-
mit of this industry expanding with confidence of
future secur'Jy. In the labric of our cherus: grad-
uate imagination and scientific correlation of ideas
appear all too frequently as mere embryonic factors.
These semi-developed young men cannot accom-
plish much of worth and yet they work to the best
of their ability. One may criticize their superiors
in not lending more constant assistance, but here,
if I may be frank, let me say that their superiors
have many other duties and cannot devote their
time and energy to show each beginner how to read
and think. Naturally you will suggest that these
industries need young men graduating with doctor's
degrees. Very true—but I do not believe that doc-
tors of philosophy need be the only type of chem-
ists for chemical enterprises.
*****
The Need of Physics and Engineering in the
Training of the Chemist
When we have taken to heart the important fac-
tors which make for progress in chemistry, and
when we duly comprehend that at the basis lies the
development of high-class chemists and these alone,
then a few words concerning their training should
not be amiss. Fruitless in the extreme is the re-
search in chemical art as prosecuted in universities
or elsewhere outside the range of industrial plants.
Wonderful, indeed, is the value of research in pure
science to the young chemist. I well recollect what
some of my friends have thought about researches
on the constitution of some complex organic mole-
cule. Their smile with, "What's the use of it all,"
amuses me still. I now affirm that this class of re-
search is of highest importance, and I would that
every research man in our Company had to his ex-
perience at least a piece of investigation on the con-
stitution of some simple salt under varying condi-
tions of combined solvent, we shall say, or that of
some organic molecule, if blessed only with but one
simple constituent. Herein the principles of phys-
ics and chemistry come fully into play, and the val-
ue of such researches so far outweighs all others
that the latter seem as mere commonplace. The re-
sults in our industrial research laboratories fully
bear out my contentions, and we have come to real-
ize that we must have men who have engaged in
research in chemical science and not in a hodge-
podge of childish delectation, which so many of our
inactive professors would pass off as research.
The possibility of a four-year trained chemist or
chemical engineer, immediately after entering the
chemical industries, being able to function in any
other capacity than as a simple analyst is veritably
an absurdity. Industrial research laboratories are
now manned with a higher personnel, thanks to the
period of depression which served to weed out near-
chemists everywhere. When further assistance is
desired we shall seek the best trained men we can
get. What is a thousand dollars more or less in
salary to a man who has his doctor's degree or sev-
earl additional years of study and research to his
credit?
Thus, of greatest benefit to the young chemist are
courses in mechanical drawing, machine shop, test-
ing materials; courses in calculus, in advanced phys-
ics, with emphasis upon thermo-dynamics and elec-
trical theory; and finally courses where practical

studies are made of distillation, evaporation, and fil-
tration. In fact, it is not too cruel to state that
those young men who plan to enter the chemical
profession without thorough training in the princi-
ples of physics and engineering, such as are gained
by a study of subjects outlined above, are building
for themselves hazards innumerable and it were far
better for them and for the cause itself to keep olT
the course.
During war operations time and money were
more or less disregarded so long as production in-
creased. Today it is different, a young man who
requires the time of others for his assistance costs
the company twice his salary, and thus it is easy
to see how any industry would prefer to employ
those who have already had experience, many of
whom are now without positions.
The chemical courses at a university are of course
the mainstay of the chemist's training, but they are
not more necessary than the engineering. Only the
narrow-minded man could conceive of a chemist as
able to practice without practical learning. A phil-
osopher, in other words, has no place in the chem-
ical W'orld of industry save as an ornament.
True, we can always make use of the newly fledg-
ed graduate as an analyst with the hope he will de-
velop, but what chances has he among those who
have advanced training to their credit? And under
such adverse conditions I must not pass without ac-
claiming marked superiority on the part of the
chemists with a broad engineering training. The
graduate in chemistry without engineering is al-
most hopeless. Of course he is helpless, for he has
no idea of what engineering means, and in the re-
search laboratories he is worse than helpless now
that these laboratories have come into an abundant
supply of more experienced men. About all that is
left is an apprenticeship for washing apparatus.
Those young men who contemplate chemistry as
their life work should strain every effort to remain
at the university for one to two years after gradua-
tion. This time should be devoted, primarily, to
real investigation. The young chemist will thus de-
velop as nowhere else is possible. Every phase A
engineering that bears upon chemical industries
should be studied with zeal. The principles of phys-
ics should be incorporated into the student's very
being as a basic subject, not held aloof as something
unnecessary. When these young men finally entei
the world of chemistry, they will stand easilv to the
fore and I assure you they will be given preference
henceforth.
We rejoice that we command the best personnel
obtainable, and we fear not to undertake the most
complex of investigations. But let us not lose sight
of that deluge of halfbaked material which is likely
to be cast upon us again, as the British surmise,
owing to the postbellum rush of young men into
chemical studies. Is it not fitting that our univer-
sity men grasp the situation and divert what ma-
terial seems below standard into other courses
where requirements will be less stringent? Only
the highest grade of student should attempt to en-
ter the chemical industries this year, and even these
will scarcely find favorable situations. Nc better
opportunity ever presented itself to the graduates
in chemistry and chemical engineering to render a
service to chemistry and at the same time to im-
prove their own faculties. Follow some problem of
research for yet another year, and you will contrib-
ute your good share to that progress in the science
in America which we zealously covet.

The Automotive Laboratory
By Professor W. E. Lay
A Discussion of the Relative Value of the Industrial and the Technical School Laboratory and
Their Methods and Limitations. Reasons Why Michigan Should Have an Automotive
Laboratory. Description of •the New Laboratory and its Facilities
During the war research and scientific investiga-
tion of everything having a possible relation to the
great conflict were conducted on a scale never be-
fore attempted. The war has been called the war
of engineers and scientists. It might well be called
the war of the automobile industries, for certainly
no other industry played a more important part and
development work was particularly intense. Now
that the big problem has apparently been solved
there is no less a need for continued work of this
nature. It is true, of course, that in the reconstruc-
tion period the most rigid economy is necessary.
But research work carried on with the full utiliza-
tion of all present facilities will ultimately be an
economy. It always has been an economy ulti-
mately.
From time immemorial the seat of learning, the
school, has been also the center of research. Grad-
ually through the painstaking efforts of men at edu-
cational centers has the complex mass of known
facts been gathered, arranged and classified to form
the body of what we call the sciences. It is neces-
sary for every modern scientific school or college
to maintain laboratories where work can be done by
the student, which proves how certain principles
and theories hold true and also shows him their lim-
itations in practical application. There is in the
United States a large quantity of such equipment
available for accurate scientific investigation and in
most cases it is now being used in that way. There
have also grown up in various industries large and
very completely equipped laboratories. In the case
of the automotive industry their work has been a
very important factor in the phenomenally rapid de-
velopment of the automobile.
Industrial and Technical School Research
There seems to be a fundamental difference be-
tewen industrial and technical school laboratory
work. The reason for this can be traced back to
the incentive behind the endeavor. The work done
in an industrial research laboratory is carried on
with the idea of immediate improvement of the pro-
duct or the development of new products. At the
college laboratory the incentive is often purely a
desire to explore, which finds expression more or
less in the work of any human being. Too often
this work has been done without taking into consid-
eration whether it would have an immediate prac-
tical application or indeed ever prove of value to
mankind. However, it will be admitted that in gen-
eral the work is done in a thorough and conclusive
manner. The university, at which every one is
searching for knowledge, has an atmosphere con-
ducive to the complete solution of problems in all
their details. The work is carried on in a manner
at once painstaking and accurate without serious
interference or time limit and should give results
conclusive beyond question.
In the industrial experimental laboratory real re-
search is carried on but there is always a tendency
to side-track it to give way for makeshifts which
will temporarily satisfy the demands of the public
or the sales force and return a satisfactory profit.

have been exhausted, and bring the work to a suc-
cessful conclusion. There are some types of work
which can best be done in an industrial laboratory
daily production of 5,574 cars or approximately 1,-
670,000 for the year. As the year's production for
the whole United States was under 2,000,000, Mich-
igan produced more than three-fourths of the auto-
mobiles built in the United States for the year 1919.
Automobile Laboratory at University of Michigan
There has been at the University a gradual de-
velopment of laboratories and equipment for use in
teaching engineering science with particular refer-
ence to its application to problems met in the de-
sign and operation of automotive vehicles. Among
these is the automobile division of the mechanical
laboratory. This section quickly outgrew the space
allowed in the main laboratory and this year moved
into one of the cantonment type of buildings used
for training army mechanics during the war, occu-

and probably will always be done there. On the
other hand, some research work can very properly
be done at the laboratories of our universities and
technical colleges.
There are general investigations which can be
taken up by the industry as a whole and it is per-
haps this kind of subject that can be handled best
in a laboratory of a State university or technical
college. The University of Michigan by virtue of
its location in the center of the automobile industry
should be among those considered for work along
these lines. The accompanying statistics taken
from Automotive Industries on the distribution of
automobile and truck builders will help make this
clear. In the same magazine, the daily production
of cars by the leading motor-car builders in Au-
gust, 1919, was reported. Twenty-six of the 34
listed were located in Michigan and had a total
pying a floor-space fox 120 ft. This laboratory is
divided into three sections, a class-room, a general
laboratory for routine testing and demonstration
and a research room where accurate mechanical
testing and investigations can be carried out. The
classroom is supplied with tables, charts and data
books needed in computing the results of experi-
mental tests.
General Laboratory
The second section is equipped with seven engine
testing-stands and three water-dynamometers of
from 20 to 6o-hp. capacity and one calibrated fan-
brake. The water-dynamometers are mounted on a
track so that they can be easily moved to position
at the rear of any engine' where they are fastened
in approximate alignment by two holding-down tee-
bolts. The dynamometer is connected to the en-
gine by a drive-shaft with two metal universal-

joints. The shaft is splined at both ends. Both
engines and dynamometers are fitted with the same
universal-joint unit which is fitted to receive the
splined ends of the shaft. To disconnect the dyna-
mometer from the engine it is necessary to loosen
the holding-down bolts and move the dynamometer
down the track until one universal-joint slides free
from the shaft. Then the shaft can be removed en-
tirely and held ready to go into place as the dyna-
mometer is aligned with the next engine. Water
for cooling the engines and the dynamometers is
furnished through two pipes on the wall, one sup-
plying cold water and the other water at any de-
sired temperature from cold to near the boiling-
point. If the engine is aircooled conditions similar
to those in operation on the road are obtained by
use of a portable Sirocco blower driven by a direct-
connected electric motor. Fuel is supplied from 10-
gal. tanks mounted on light stands supplied with
large casters so that they can be rolled to the gaso-
line pumps for refilling w^hen necessary.
There are available for demonstration and tests
over 20 engines varying in size from the Ford to the
Liberty aviation engine. Two chassis are used for
car-performance tests including hill-climbing, accel-
eration and economy of fuel over the driving range.
In addition, there is mounted on demonstrating
racks considerable equipment, including carburet-
ers, ignition systems, governors, clutches, trans-
missions and rear axles.
Research Dynamometer Room
The third section, the research room, includes
among its larger equipment a 100-hp. and a 60-hp.
electric dynamometer, a set of chassis testing
drums, a drawbar pull dynamometer and a motor-
generator set. The dynamometers are fully equip-
ped with switchboards, load resistances, control
rheostats, beam-scales, tachometers and electrically
operated revolution-counters to be used in conjunc-
tion with the pull measuring apparatus. The im-
portant feature of this room is the layout of the
dynamometers and testing-floor to use the dyna-
mometers to their full capacity. It had been found
in previous years that when a complicated set-up
had been built up for special work the dynamometer
could not be used for any other work without tear-
ing down the set-up and making a new one. So
when the new laboratory was laid out the pedestals
of the dynamometer were mounted in a flat circular
bedplate or base with a circular groove on its under
surface. A similar base was set in the concrete with
a corresponding groove in its upper surface. These
grooves are filled with %:inch steel balls and form
a bearing upon which the dynamometer can be turn-
ed to align its shaft with any one of the four test-
ing-bases or the countershaft driven by the chassis
drums. The dynamometer is located exactly by
two dowel pins directly under its shaft. The rela-
tive position of the dynamometer and engine bases
is illustrated in Fig. 3.
Metal universal-joints and a drive-shaft splined
at both ends are used here as well as on the water-
brakes. As the dynamometer is rotated on its base,
the distance between the universal-joint on the dy-
namometer and that on the engine is increased until
one splined end of the shaft comes free from its uni-
versal-joint. The shaft can then be readily removed
and placed in position on another engine so that it
goes into place as the dynamometer is brought into
alignment with it. Thus the dynamometer can be

disconnected from one engine and connected to an-
other in 5 or 10 minutes.
The chassis-testing outfit consists essentially of
two drums, having a wood surface 6 feet in diameter
and 18 inches wide, which are mounted on large
shafts at the proper distance apart to correspond
with the track of an automobile. The outer end of
each shaft is splined and will fit the axle drive-gears
of a 5-ton truck differential carrier assembly in place
of an axle-shaft. This in turn will drive a heavy
gearset which drives the dynamometer through si-
lent chains as outlined in Fig. 4. The dynamome-
ters can thus be driven at the same speed as the
dynamometer and engine set-up shown in Tig. 3.
In front of the scale-beam is a table supported by
the dynamometer base. The field-rheostats or load
and speed controls have been placed under this with
the control-wheels above. A throttle and spark-
control quadrant is located on the post just above
the table and the large tachometer is only 2 feet
from the eyes of the operator. This brings all con-
trols within easy reach and with the dynamometer
in any of its positions the switchboard is never
more than two steps from the operators' position at
the control table.
The engine bases are built up of four slotted rails

er-output of a chassis can be determined by meas-
uring the pull of the car with a drawbar dynamome-
ter and determining the peripheral speed of the
drums.
The motor-generator set is used to furnish direct
current to operate the electric dynamometers. The
motor, being of the synchronous type, is not affect-
ed by variations of voltage and will maintain a con-
stant speed of the electric generator and a constant
voltage at the dynamometer switchboard.
Among the more interesting details might be
mentioned the arrangement of the controls of' the

embedded in a concrete slab separated from the rest
of the floor by planks. If the engine being tested
develops excessive vibration, it is not communicat-
ed through the floor to the dynamometer or any of
the weighing apparatus. The gutter shown be-
tween the engine and dynamometer hases carries off
the water and contains the main exhaust and hot
and cold water pipes. By a suitable arrangement of
valves water is delivered from the outlet through
garden-hose to the engine jacket, the radiator or
cooling tank at any desired temperature.

By L. C. Sabin, '90
The title of this article has been almost a slogan
with Sault Ste. Marie for many years, and the hope
of its accomplishment is now just being realized.
Located on the St. Mary's River at the point
where the waters of Lake Superior tumble over an
outcropping of Potsdam sandstone, giving the name
Sault or leap, this oldest town in Michigan has had
always a unique interest from the time when it was
the rendezvous of the Chippewas coming to take the
whitefish from its foaming rapids.
Water Power and Commerce.
Lake Superior, with its surface area about as
large as the State of
Maine and a depth of over
1,000 feet, is the larg-
est single volume of fresh
water. It has a drainage
area of over 76,000 square
miles, and the discharge
of its outlet under natural
conditions varies from
52,000 c.f.s. at low water
to 122,000 c.f-s. at the
highest recorded stage,
the mean supply being
about 82,000 c.f.s. This
voiume of water, with a
fall of 20 feet concen-
trated in the rapids at
Sault Ste. Marie, has a
potential energy of 186,000 gross horse power. With
proper allowance for development losses and low water
periods, there remains about 100,000 net horse power
available.
As Lake Superior carries a yearly commerce of
products worth a billion dollars, its use as a mill
pond must be considered secondary to its main pur-
pose as a navigable waterway. In other words, it
cannot be drawn upon as a source of power to the
extent of lowering its surface with resultant reduc-
tion of depth in its harbors. The purpose of this
paper is to describe briefly how these two interests
have been coordinated by the construction of regu-
lating works at the head of St. Mary's Rapids.
Natural Regulation
The St. Mary's River, forming the outlet of Lake
Superior, connecting it with Lake Huron, is about
64 miles in length and has a total fall of from 20 to
24 feet, according to the relative stages of the two
lakes. About 18 miles below Lake Superior the St.
Mary's Rapids, cut through a Potsdam sandstone
ledge, which may be considered the rim of the lake,
forming a natural regulating weir. Under natural
conditions the cross sectional area of the stream at
the head of the rapids was about 16,000 square feet,
and a rise of one foot in the lake surface bears so
great a ratio to the area of the drainage basin that
the mean supply for three months would raise the
lake only nine inches if there were no outflow. Due
to these two conditions, the natural regulation of
lake level was so perfect that the maximum record-
ed range in monthly mean levels of the lake was
from a minimum of 600.8 to a maximum of 604.1
feet above mean tide at New York.
Mr. Sabin is one of Michigan's most prom-
inent engineering graduates. He was graduated
in 1890 and obtained the degree of C.E. in 1894.
From 1893 to 1905 he was assistant engineer in
the U. S. army. After serving as American Sec-
retary on the International Waterway Commis-
sion during 1905 and 1906, Mr. Sabin became the
General Superintendent of the St. Mary's Falls
Canal, which position he still holds. His work,
as builder of the third and the new fourth locks,
has firmly established his reputation as a great
engineer. It is interesting to note that Mr. Sa-
bin was, in 1890, on the Board of Editors of
The Technic. He is a member of Tau Beta Pi.
Obstructions in the
Outlet
This natural condition
was first disturbed in
1887, when the building
of the International Rail-
way Bridge across the
head of the Rapids, near
the controlling section,
placed nine piers in the
river, and closed certain
side outlets, obstructing
about 14 per cent of the
cross sectional area and
cutting off about 8 per
cent of the natural flow of
water.
Power development was begun on the American
side in a small way at about the time of building the
bridge, and under a permit granted by the Secretary
of War in 1892 a dike was extended into the rapids
by the Chandler-Dunbar Water Power Co. to form
a head race for the power plant of an allied company,
the Edison Sault Electric Co. This dike cut off the
free flow through two spans of the bridge, obstruct-
ing about 9 per cent of the mean discharge.
On the Canadian side a canal was built in 1889 by
the Ontario Light and Power Co., the works finally
being acquired by the Great Lakes Power Co. This
canal obstructed a small stream between the islands
along the Canadian shore, and in 1901 the area un-
der the northerly span of the bridge was also closed.
The effect of these various obstructions was to
confine the natural flow of the stream to seven
bridge spans, reducing the cross sectional area of
the rapids by about 42 per cent, and the discharge
at mean stage by about 23 per cent. The effect of
these obstructions, if not compensated by flow

through the canals, would have been to raise the
level of the lake by about a foot. In other words,
the mean flow through the restricted cross section
required a stage about a foot higher than that at
which the mean flow passed the original unobstruct-
ed section.
Power Development
Great Lakes Power Co.: The canal on the Can-
adian side, now owned by the Great Lakes Power
Co., cuts through some of the small channels among
the islands, making what is practically an indepen-
dent outlet and increasing the discharge capacity.
This canal has been enlarged from time to time, and
is still being improved. The present use of water,
about 16,000 c.f.s., is to be increased to 20,000 c.f.s.,
Michigan Northern Power Co.: The power canal
now owned by the Michigan Northern Power Co.
is excavated through the terrain where Sault Ste.
Marie is located, and thus forms a new outlet out-
side the original channel (see Fig. i). This canal
has a capacity of about 30,000 c.f.s., developing
about 40,000 horse power at the switchboard.
Need of Controlling Discharge
During the early stages of power development the
use of water in the side outlets formed by the power
canals was partially or wholly offset by the obstruc-
tions placed in the rapids, but with the increasing
use of water for power, it became necessary to pro-
vide means of regulating the flow by placing in the

giving some 35,000 horse power, in the completed
plant.
U. S. Power Plant: The power plant now owned
by the United States and operated under lease by
the Edison Sault Electric Co., is built in the rapids,
and the enlargement of the channel has not been
sufficient to make up for the obstruction created by
the dikes forming the headrace. The effect of this
power plant was thus an obstruction rather than an
enlargement to the discharge capacity. Sluice gates
have been placed in the dam, however, to permit
natural flow in case it should be required. The
plant has a present capacity of about 2,500 c.f.s.,
developing 3,200 horse power, but this capacity may
be doubled under the legal and physical conditions
now being obtained.
natural channel compensating works provided with
movable gates; that is, to replace, by artificial con-
trolling works, the regulation of level offered by the
natural conditions which were being disturbed.
The desired control was accomplished under two
governmental acts,—first, the Federal law of March
3, 1909, providing for the acquisition by the United
States of all lands and property lying north of the
St. Mary's Falls Canal to the International boun-
dary, and empowering the Secretary of War to
lease for power purposes, under such terms as he
might consider best calculated to increase develop-
ment, any excess of water in the St. Mary's River
not required for navigation; and, second, the treaty
with Great Britain, of January I1, 1909, creating an
International Joint Commission, having the right of

review and approval of proposed works in boundary
waters that might affect the natural levels thereof.
Under the act of Congress above mentioned the
United States acquired title to all property in the
Rapids, on the American side of the boundary. This
included the plant of the Edison Sault Electric Co.
and headrace of the allied Chandler-Dunbar Water
Power Co., and the plant, with water for operation,
was then leased to the former company for a term
of years, provision being made for such extension
of use of water as seemed desirable. A lease was
also made to the Michigan Northern Power Co. for
the use of water to operate their power plant, the
quantity of 25,000 c.f.s. being allowed continuously,
and an additional 5,000 c.f.s. whenever the mainten-
ance of lake levels would permit.
The latter lease was predicated on the construc-
tion by the company of certain controlling or com-
pensating works in the rapids, to compensate for the
water taken through the power canal and permit the
control of the level of Lake Superior in accordance
with the requirements laid down by the Interna-
tional Joint Commission. The power plant of the
Great Lakes Power Co., on the Canadian side, was
made subject to the same requirements, the admin-
istration of the rules for the use of water being
lodged in a Board of Control, composed of one Can-
adian and one American official.
The requirements for lake regulation, by means
of controlled outflow, provide that the level of Lake
Superior, as measured by monthly mean readings,
shall be maintained as nearly as possible between %
the limits of 602.1 and 603.6 above mean tide, a de-
sired range of only 1.5 feet. Under natural condi-
tions the range had been 3.33 feet, and with a repe-
tition of the past rates of supply to the lake, it is
known the variation in level will sometimes exceed
the desired range. To guard against high stages,
it is provided that the rules formulated for the oper-
ation of the compensating works, when tested by
the supply conditions of extreme high water years
of the past, shall result in no higher monthly mean
level than the actual maximum attained under nat-
ural conditions, and to guard against unduly low
stages it is provided that whenever the monthly
mean level of the lake is below 602.1, the total dis-
charge permitted shall be no greater than would
have obtained at the prevailing stage under natural
conditions, before any obstructions were placed in
the rapids.
Compensating Works
The works provided to thus control the outflow
consist of 16 Stoney sluice gates of steel, each hav-
jng a clear water opening about 52 feet wide and 10
j'eet deep. The gates are supported between ma-
sonry piers 8 feet wide, recessed to receive them.
vertical bearing plates on the back of the end frames
of the gate bearing against the roller trains, which,
in turn, run on cast steel tracks, bolted to the
quoins of the piers. The gates are raised and low-
ered by hand operated machinery, located on the
bridge towers. To describe the construction in de-
tail would exceed the limitations of the present ar-
ticle.
The compensating works are located on a line 150
feet upstream from, and parallel to, the Interna-
tional Bridge. The gates and supporting piers are
of such dimensions that four gates correspond in
length to one bridge span, and the sixteen gates
cover spans 6 to 9, inclusive. Spans i and 10 are
closed by embankments, and spans 2, 3 and 4 are
within the headrace of the Government power plant.
The flow through span 5 is at present not controll-
ed, but is to be closed by a dike when the power
plant on the Canadian side is completed.
Rules for Operating Compensating Works
The monthly mean water level and volume of dis-
charge of Lake Superior are fairly well known for
the past 61 years. This permits the determination
of the mean supply to the lake for each month; the
volume of outflow or discharge, expressed in feet
depth on lake surface, added to the storage, plus
for rise in lake surface and minus for a fall, gives
the supply in terms of depth on lake. This supply
has been determined and may be used in deriving
a rule for operation of the gates such that certain
results may be attained. As such a rule may be ex-
pressed diagramatically by a curve in which tlic
abscissae represent time, or period of the year, and
the ordinates represent elevation of water surface
at which a certain number of gates shall be opened,
it is convenient to call it a rule curve.
Without attempting to explain in detail the meth-
ed of derivation of a rule curve for gate operation,
an indication of the principle involved may be given.
Suppose we are attempting to formulate that part
of the curve intended to prevent extremely low
stages. Select a period in the past when the supply
to the lake was very low. At the close of that peri-
od, say on May ist, assume the level to be at the
lowest permissible limit, 601.6 or Lm- Let the min-
imum discharge required for power purposes (in
terms of feet depth on lake for one month's use) be
p, and add this to the low limit, 601.6. Subtract the
supply for April of that year, S. (in same terms of
depth). Then Lm -f- p — Sa will be the lowest per-
missible level of the lake on April ist, if the level •
on May ist is not to be below the minimum Lm.
Likewise, if Sra is the supply for March of that yea
then the level on March ist.must be not be'-
Lm -f- 2p —- Sa — S,n: and so on, the allowablr

imum for the first of each month may be computed,
working backward from the assumed close of the
dry period. If we have selected that year in which
the supply foi the several months gives the extreme
tendency to depress the lake level, this part of the
problem is solved, but it will be found that one
year gives extreme conditions for one month and
another year the extreme conditions for another
month, so it is necessary to select several low sup-
ply years to derive a composite expressing the ex-
treme conditions for all months, such that with all
gates closed the level will not go below the desired
minimum.
In a similar manner, by considering years of high
supply to the lake, a curve is obtained to show for
each month the level of the lake at which all gates
must be opened, giving maximum discharge if the
desired maximum level is never to be exceeded with
a return of the extreme conditions of supply.
A rule curve has .been computed for present con-
ditions, with uncontrolled flow through span 5 of
the International Bridge. Had the present canals
and controlling works been in place for the past Co
years, and this rule followed in the operation of the
gates, the level of Lake Superior, as measured by
monthly mean levels, would have gone below 602.1
during 32 months, the lowest level being 601.5 in
April, 1911; these low levels would have occurred,
.however, mainly before the opening of navigation,
and the level would have been always above 602.1
by the middle of June. The level of the lake would
have risen above the desired maximum, 603.6, in
only two years, namely, 1869 and 1876, and then
would not have exceeded the level which existed
under natural conditions in those years. In 1869
the water levels indicate a supply to the lake of 3.S7
feet in six months, and in 1876 a supply of 3.24 feet
in five months. Considering the area of the lake
surface, it will be evident that under such condi-
tions of supply an unreasonable discharge capacity
would be required to prevent an extreme rise in
level.
With the rates of supply to the lake that have
prevailed in the past and the natural conditions of
discharge of the outlet, the elevation of the lake
surface as measured by the monthly mean levels
would have fluctuated between limits of 604.1 and
600.3, a range of ,-i^ feet. Under the same condi-
tions of supply and the present controlled outflow
the range would have been between 604.1 and oOf.j,
or 2.6 feet. It thus appears that while the outlet of
the lake gave naturally a high degree of regulation,
it is possible to improve it by avoiding periods of
extreme low water and, at the same time, permit
the use of the minimum flow for power purposes.
The result of the development has been then to
permit the continuous use of three-quarters of the
mean discharge of the stream for power purposes,
while reducing the fluctuation of level by one-third.
By means of this control the advantage of power
development has been accompanied by improved
navigation conditions, so that these two interests,
commonly considered antagonistic, have been
brought into coordination.

With this arrangement the dynamometer is made
to serve a variety of purposes without building new
parts for each test or disarranging it to such an ex-
tent that it cannot be made to handle a different
kind of work in a short time. In other words, it has
been made somewhat universal. There is space be-
tween the dynamometers for mounting a transmis-

This laboratory is undoubtedly the most complete

Research Work on Automobile Headlights
Dr. Sawyer, of the physics department, is con-
ducting experiments for a Detroit firm upon a new
form of automobile headlight. By means of a spe-
cial arrangement of lenses and reflectors it is hoped
to perfect a new lamp which will give a maximum
amount of. light without the glare, and so conform
with police regulations. Patents have already been
secured by the Detroit firm, although the develop-
ment has not reached a stage which would warrant
manufacture of the lamps, as their cost would be
considerably higher than the present type.

During the latter part of last year and the whole
summer term the Auto Lab has been engaged in a
series of experiments for the State Highway De-
partment, in which they have endeavored to deter-
mine the maximum economical grade that can be
used. That is, from a number of reports and trials
they have determined the cost of driving motor
trucks over a hill and the cost of driving the truck
on level ground. The State has determined the cost
of laying a road over the hill. The aim of this ex-
periment is to fix the depth of the cut necessary to
make in a hill so that the State and the auto owner
will share alike the expense. A chart is to be made
giving the results in graphical form of the experi-
ment and it is expected that a great deal of money
can be saved by the State in following this chart.
How About an Engineering Exhibit
In 1916 the Engineering College gave an Exhibit
which was widely attended and widely talked
about. It really was a very good advertisement
for Michigan. There is a present a talk of another
Exhibit which will be larger and better than that
of 1916 and the plans call for it in the spring of
1922.
A consensus of opinion shows the following:
Professor Anderson, head of the Mechanical En-
gineering Department, thinks that it is time for an-
other exhibit and says his idea is to have it a series
of exhibitions given by the different departments
and branches of the Engineering College. For ex-
ample the descriptive geometry department should
give an exhibition of their drawings, with possibly
an example or illustration of their theory put to prac-
tice. The architectural department could give draw-
ings along with some model structures. If it was
thot advisable some manufacturers could furnish
exhibits for the various departments. For example
samples of rubber might be given and steps used in
the making of different rubber goods or any other
article.
In the opinion of Professor A. H. White, of the
Chemical Department, the proposed exhibit is a
good experience for those who give their time and
thought to the success of the enterprise, but he does
not believe that the exhibit in itself is sufficient
compensation for the expense of time, energy and
money put into it. The University runs about 200
days a year at an expense of $4,000,000 or about
$20,000 a day. The College of Engineering has ap-
proximately 20% of the students, and from this we
may assume its running expense as being $4,000 a
day. The Department would run at about 50%
efficiency during this period of the exhibit, causing
a daily loss of $2,000, thus raising the expense of
the college to $6,000 for each day of the exhibit.
He hardly believes that it is worth such an ex-
pense. He feels that it is considered as a circus by
a large number of students and that very little ac-
tual value is gained.
It seems that the opinion of the faculty is gener-
ally in favor of an exhibit and most of them feel
that they would be willing to devote some time to
the planning of it. At any rate, it is about time to
get started to find out whether we shall have one
or not.
Personal Column
Herschel C. Smith, formerly Deputy State High-
way Engineer of Oklahoma, has been appointed As-
sistant Professor of Highway Engineering and
Highway Transport at the University of Michigan
from which institution he graduated in 1913.' Last
October, Mr. Smith was elected Roy D. Chapin
Fellow in Highway Transport at the University of
Michigan and in June received the degree of Mas-
ter of Science in Highway Engineering and High-
way Transport.
The personnel of the R. O. T. C. has been in-
creased by the addition of Capt. F. E. Collins. The
Captain will have entire charge of the Infantry
work at the University and he expects to have a
full company with which he hopes to demonstrate
the worth of the Infantry.
Prof. S. J. Zowski has returned from a protracted
leave of absence which was started by the death of
his father who left him a Polish newspaper edited
in Milwaukee. Prof. Zowski took charge of this
paper for a while personally. He has made sevetalf'
trips to Poland attending to family affairs.



EDITED BY SAMUEL S. REUBEN
Michigan Man Makes Enviable Record
Among the Michigan Engineers who have made
good in the West, Rex C. Starr stands out as one
of the most prominent. Soon after completing his
Civil Engineering course here in 1907, Mr. Starr
became assistant engineer of the Detroit River Tun-
nel Company. Since that time he has worked on
some of the largest engineering projects in the
western states.
In the fall of 1909 Mr. Starr became resident en-
gineer of the Snoquolimie Falls Hydro Electric
Plant at Snoqualimie Falls, Washington. He was
next engaged by the above company on their
White River development work at Seattle. He also
spent two years as superintendent of construction
on the Big Creek Hydro-Electric Development for'
the Pacific Light and Power Corporation, in Cali-
fornia.
For four years, from 1914 to 1918, Mr. Starr was
hydraulic engineer for the Southern California Edi-
son Company at Los Angeles. During the follow-
ing year he was superintendent of construction for
Stone and Webster, of Seattle, in which time he
had charge of several important pieces of work.
From then until the present time Mr. Starr has
been construction engineer of the San Joaquin
Light and Power Corporation at Fresno, Cal.
Michigan Engineer's Club of Chicago
The Michigan Engineer's Club of Chicago held
its 19th Annual Dinner at the City Club, Friday
evening, April 8, 1921. There were 128 present,
making the attendance the largest in many years.
Everyone regretted the absence of President Bur-
ton, but knew that the success of the occasion was
assured by the presence of Dean Cooley. The Dean
was in g6od spirits, as always, and entertained with
stories, and enlightened with information concern-
-?"!£ the University's problems, particularly those
rrnsing out of the tremondous growth and extension
of the University.
Prof. Anderson told of attempts that are being
made to enable the engineering student to derive
benefit from courses offered by other colleges on
the campus without its disrupting a thorough en-
gineering program of study.
Prof. Bailey remarked on the efforts that are be-
ing made to prevent over-specialization in the engi-
neering college. Prof. White filled out the pro-
gram well with his interesting talk on the prob-
lems and the program of research at the University.
Among the faculty guests of the Club were Dean
M. E. Cooley, and Professors H. C. Anderson, Ben-
jamin F. Bailey, A. H. White, Ward F. Davidson,
John Airey, and J. B. Brodie.
Officers elected for the year 1921-1922 were Sut-
ton Van Pelt, '98, President; Paul A. Dratz, 'oo,
Vice-President; Joe Magidsohn, '10, Treasurer, and
Dean W. Taylor, '16, Secretary.
The Club has the promise of the attendance of
both former President Blanchard and Dean Cooley
for the 1922 Club Dinner and is assured that this
year's attendance will be surpassed next year.
Regular meetings of the Michigan Engineers'
Club of Chicago are held on the second Thursday
of each month at 12:15 P. M., Chicago Engineers'
Club, 314 Federal Street, Chicago. The Club now
has something over 550 Michigan engineers, all of
whom live in Chicago and the vicinity.
Michigan Alumnus Heads Armour Institute
Howard Monroe Raymond, '93, has been appoint-
ed acting president of the Armour Institute of
Technology at Chicago. Mr. Raymond has been
with the Institute for over 26 years, and is filling
the vacancy brought about by the death of Dr.
Frank Gunsaulus.
He was born in Grass Lake, Michigan, on Oct.
25, 1872. In 1893. he got his B.S. degree from the
engineering school, followed by a year of graduate
work in physics and electricity. He went as in-


Page 31
MICHIGAN
TECHNIC

structor of physics to Armour Institute in 1895,
became dean of engineering and professor of experi-
mental physics in 1903.
Mr. Raymond is editor-in-chief of the Cyclopae-
dia of Modern Shop Practice and a member of nu-
merous engineering societies. Among them are the
Society for the Promotion of Engineering Educa-
tion, the American Association for the Advance-
ment of Science, the Western Society of Engineers,
and the Electrical Vehicle Association of America.
Michigan Engineers' Club of Pittsburgh
The Michigan Engineers' Club of Pittsburgh
held its annual "Cooley" dinner on Saturday even-
ing, May 7, at the Chatham Hotel. There were fif-
ty members present, a large attendance in view of
the fact that this represented practically 50% of
the Michigan Engineers in the District.
Dean Cooley and Professor A. H. White were
guests from the University. The Dean furnished
the members with choice news from the Campus,
including several messages sent to the Pittsburgh
Alumni by President Burton and other faculty
members. He also talked on the pleasant relations
that are being brought about between the manufac-
turers, the faculty members and the University.
Professor A. H. White discussed the new depart-
ment of Industrial Research, comparing it with
those at the "M. I. T." and Pittsburgh, bringing
out in detail the advantage of the Michigan De-
partment over those of the other schools.
"Bob" Hammond officiated as toastmaster, and
did much to liven up the meeting by his interesting
remarks, which of course had much to do with the
football prospects. Judging by "Bob's" remarks,
we are going to have "some" team this fall.
Preceding the dinner, about twenty members
drove to the new 60,000 kilowatt plant of the Du-
quesne Light Company, Colfax, where a thorough
inspection was made of the immense plant, now en-
tirely in operation. All reported an excellent trip.
The Board of Directors chose the following officers
for next year: M. R. Moxley, President; A. Mac-
kenzie, Secretary, and L. W. Haller, Treasurer.
The Club requests that any Michigan Alumnus,
knowing Michigan men in this district, send their
names and addresses to the Secretary, Mr. Macken-
zie, 709 Carry Bldg., Pittsburgh, Pa.
Glen D. Angle
Glen D. Angle, '15, has been holding down many
important positions since he left Michigan. After
graduation, he was first a Designer with the Oak-
land Motor Car Co., Detroit, and then, in the same
capacity, with the Studebaker Co. Next, as Chief
Engineer for the Dort Motor Car Co., in Flint, he
had charge of the design of their first pleasure car.
After this he returned to Detroit to accept the po-
sition as Designer for the King Motor Car Co., fol-
lowing which he was Experimental and Sales En-
gineer for Thermo Vacuum Systems. He then left
for Buffalo to become Engine Designer for the
Curtis Aeroplane and Motor Corporation, where,
directly under the Chief Engineer, he had charge
of the design of the K-I2 and K-6 engines. His
most recent work has been in the Engineering Di-
vision of the U. S. Air Service, stationed at Mc-
Cook Field, Dayton, Ohio. He was engaged in de-
signing the Universal Test Engine, which has been
successfully used for the last year and a half by the
Engineering Division in testing various styles of
cylinders.
Mr. Angle has written several articles on airplane
engine design, and has been preparing a book on
the same subject.
James R. Bibbins is Honored

Koehring re-mixed concrete is
DOMINANT strength concrete.

SEVENTY-NINE per cent of all the contracts
let for the building of hard surface highways
in Kansas in 1919, 1920 and 1921 to date,
have been or are being built with Koehring Pavers.
Such an almost universal choice by Kansas contractors speaks
more eloquently cf the value and worthiness of Koehring
Pavers than pages cf advertising could possibly do.
Here are the statistics:
Total number miles of concrete road let to date
in Kansas '. 181.349
Total number miles of brick road let to date in
Kansas 60.043
Total mileage of hard surfaced roads let 241.392
Mileage paved or being paved with Koehring
machines 191.309
Mileage paved or being paved with all other
machines 50.083
Percentage of Koehring paved roads 79.249
Percentage of roads paved with all other machines 20.752
Of the 181.349 miles of concrete roads let, 137.224 miles,
or 75.668% are Koehring built roads. And of the 60,043
miles of brick roads let, 54.085 miles, or 90.077% are con-
structed with Koehring pavers.
The customer is the final judge of worth. And 79% of the
state hard road builders of Kansas back their judgment that
the Koehring Heavy Duty paver is the paver of absolute
dependability.

Presenting the Detroit Single Retort Underfeed Stoker
The first single retort Detroit Underfeed Stoker
was completed two years ago. It was not an-
nounced to the public because the Company does
not believe in advertising products which have
not been thoroughly proved for a long period
under hard service conditions. Today there are
over ONE HUNDRED INSTALLATIONS,
all successful and the Company takes pride in
formally presenting this stoker to the power plant
operators of the country.
Incorporated in its design are the best fruits of a
practical knowledge gained in the Company's
twenty years of successful stoker building, and the
recent important developments in the science
of combustion.
This single retort stoker possesses the very great ad-
vantage of horizontal retort and tuyeres. It is side-
cleaning. Dump is hand operated and refuse can be
removed either through ash doors in the front,
or delivered below to hopper or ash conveyer.
The arrangement for admitting air, under control
through specially designed tuyeres at both sides
of the retort, produces a high overload on quick
demand. Regulation of feed of the coal and
removal of the clinker and ash are both accom-
plished without interference with the operation
of the stoker.
Other features include an adjustable ram operated
by reduction gears from a shaft below, driven by
a small engine or motor. All gear worms and
moving parts are fully enclosed, running in oil
and are easily accessible. The simplicity of the
design without any moving parts in the fire,
insures a minimum maintenance cost.
Many other distinctive features make this stoker
one of the best possible investments for use with
boilers developing up to 300 or 400 H. P. For
boilers developing greater capacity there are
Detroit Multiple Retort Underfeed Stokers.

The Rajah of the native State of Mysore resides in this palace in the capital
city of the same name. What a strange note this modern elevator must bring
to this palace! . . . The civilization of the West reaching into the very heart
of the Orient and paving the way for other products!
As an achievement, this Otis installation is noteworthy in itself, but its chief

The airplane will in due time become a form of
.transportation almost as economical as the automo-
bile, if not more so. The actual cost of carrying
a passenger a mile is already less in many airplanes
than it is in an automobile, and I predict that the
high price of machines which so far has placed
aviation out of practical commercial use will event-
ually be changed. With this, will come the prepara-
tion of landing fields in every little municipality;
guide signs and signals will be provided which will
make possible a great volume of air traffic.
For many years the idea that the automobile
would ever supplant the driving horse was doubted
and people even refused to believe that it would re-
place the draft horse in trucking and farming.
Nevertheless this also is coming to pass.
The same will be true of airplanes in the future.
The fact that there are airplanes today which carry
six passengers at a rate of one hundred miles an
hour, and make ten miles to the gallon of gasoline,
proves that flying is not necessarily expensive. I
know of no automobile that at the same speed, with
a similar load /will show such fuel economy, and,
in fact, a six passenger automobile that will give
ten miles to a gallon at sixty miles an hour is con-
sidered a very efficient machine.
Present Problem is First Cost
The greatest factor in favor of the airplane, how-
ever, is that it requires no rails or even a road to
travel on. With the element of road building elim-
inated you have a tremendous saving which can be
credited to airplane travel. Landing fields can be
easily prepared at a. seasonable outlay, and every
small city will have one in the near future. There
will be guide signs and signals to direct the aviators
in landing in foggy weather, as well as in clear, and
these are all that will be required for the coming
airplane. Tire cost also will be included in the sav-
ing, because the wheels run for only a few hundred
yards in taking off and landing. Until recently the
repair bills have been large because of the character
of the machines and lack of skill in landing. This
has now been almost entirely eliminated-
So the matter will resolve itself to one of the first
cost of the vehicles. The cost of airplanes is still
beyond the reach of the average person, but that
will soon be changed. There are a number of for-

eign airplanes today that can be produced by man-
facturing methods like those which have made the
motor car so cheap, and I predict that the automo-
tive manufacturers will soon achieve as great a
triumph with airplanes. With the airplane reduced
to standardized manufacturing terms it immediately
becomes a commercial possibility that will place it
within reach of men who will use it not merely for
sport, but as the motor car of today, to save time.
I don't know that the
airplane will ever supplant
the motor car. It will be
an ally rather than a
rival. It is a fact that no
form of transporation ever
invented has ever become
obsolete. There still re-
main certain activities in
which the most primitive
vehicle has its use and in
which it will probably
continue to serve until the
end of time.
I believe that the Amer-
ican automotive engineers
will actually be able to
improve on any present
design of airplane, espe-
cially that the all-metal
tvpe of plane may be re-
duced to manufacturing
terms.
Development Will Be
Along Two Lines
The developments in
the next few years will, I
believe, b e along two
lines. First, the develop-
ment of machines capable of carrying large numbers
of passengers and operating much as the railroads
do, on regular schedule between the larger cities
and eventually between much smaller places.
In the second place, there will be developed small-
er and faster planes, both for mail service, for quick
transportation and for private use somewhat in the
same way that the automobile is now used. Both
of these lines of development may be expected to
proceed together and to furnish between them a
wide and flexible air service.
In the carrying of large numbers of passengers,
the dirigible at present has a distinct advantage,
largely for the psychological reason that people
travelling by it feel safer than when travelling by air-
plane. The development of power plants and con-
trol systems for the big gas bags has been such that

they are now substantially safe against any ordinary
storm.
The development of large airplanes is limited at
present by our incomplete knowledge of plane struc-
ture. With any structure which has yet been de-
vised, a point comes where the increase in the
weight of the plane must be out of all proportion
to the increased carrying capacity, and until this
handicap is overcome, airplanes cannot exceed a
very limited size.
At present it appears
that they cannot be con-
structed economically to
carry more than 40 to 50
passengers, but we may
expect to see planes of this
capacity operating within
a very short time. Furth-
er experiments with plane
structure, with new mate-
rials for wing covering
and particularly with all-
metal planes may easily
lead to a considerable in-
crease in the limits of
weight carrying practica-
bility.
200 Miles an Hour Is
a Possibility
The development of the
smaller planes, which will
follow somewhat along
the lines of use of the au-
tomobile, is a compara-
tively simple matter. Wre
are already assured of the
possibility of speeds
around 200 miles an hour,
and of whatever carrying capacity may seem desir-
able in the light planes. My own opinion is that
the airplanes for private use are likely to approach
the capacity of the modern touring car and han-
dle something like six passengers, in addition to
the pilot. These ought shortly to be making regu-
lar non-stop trips of a thousand miles.
The limitations which have been imposed upon
the development of commercial aviation by the lack
of landing fields are being overcome more rapidly
than is generally realized. No complete census of
such fields has been made for the United States, but
a recent investigation of the state of Michigan
alone showed 117 such fields. It is entirely safe
to expect that within a very few years there will
be no important town without one, and a great
many individuals will have them for their own use.

Aerial Mail is a Means of Development
Probably the most immediate opportunity for
practical development of airplane service is for a
wholesale extension of the present aerial mail of the
Post Office Department. If the mail service is taken
seriously and properly extended throughout the
country, we may expect very definite and valuable
results in short order.
In the first place, there will appear promptly a
greatly increased reliability, because in this service
planes must fly on schedule time and failures would
be brought forcibly to the attention of authorities.
A greater cruising radius would also be evolved,
since in the service it is desirable to fly for long
distances without landing. Direct non-stop flights
between New York and Chicago may be expected as
one of the almost immediate developments. The
cost of airplanes also would be gradually reduced be-
cause manufacturers would receive enough orders
to permit them to "tool up" their factories and begin
standardized quantity production.
Economical, reliable aircraft engines would be
developed for this service and, because of the quanti-
ties required, it naturally follows that such engines
would be obtained on short notice at a minimum
cost. These engines could be developed so that they
would be equally good for the mail service or for
military purposes.
There would be a prompt improvement in those
instruments for airplanes such as are required for
flying at night, in cloudy weather, etc. Finally the
service would conserve the technical knowledge and
expert artisans developed during the war and would
increase technical knowledge and develop craftsmen.
It would also provide a constant demand for good
pilots with the result that we would always have a
large number in training who would be immediately
available in case of emergency.
Airplanes Vital Factor in War
The military aspect of aviation must never be for-
gotten in considering this subject. Airplanes were
vital in the last war and will be even more so in the
next one. During the last war, the Government had
no trouble in obtaining prompt delivery of passenger
cars and trucks because such vehicles had been
thoroughly developed and were being produced in
quantities for other uses.
The aerial mail offers the best immediate possi-
bility of bringing about the same condition in aero-
nautics. In the first place, it will make mail carry-
ing planes and pilots immediately available in cases
of emergency- In the second place, it will bring
about commercial use of airplanes, which in the
final analysis is the real answer, since it will provide
America with great fleets of planes and of dirigibles
that will put us beyond danger in case of sudden
trouble.
First Electric Locomotive Was Built in 1847
it is an odd looking contrivance, about three by
five by ten feet, driven by a motor built crudely on
the principle of the motor of today. A wheel to
which magnets were attached was mounted on a
frame above the floor of the locomotive and these
magnets were attracted on their downward course
by a three-coil field fixed on the floor of the machine
directly in the course of the wheel. As each magnet
on the wheel passed the ends of the coils, it was re-
pelled upward on the next quarter of its revolution,
and so on. The shaft of this wheel was geared to
the wheels of the locomotive. Thus the magnet
wheel corresponded to the armature of the modern
motor and the fixed coils on the floor formed the
field.
Electric current was supplied by batteries which
were first carried in a box on the locomotive. Later,
these primary cells were grouped in a "power plant"
beside the track so that current was transmitted to
the locomotive through the rails. This was the first
known instance of transmitting electric power from
a central source to traveling apparatus, which is
now one of the fundamental principles of electric
railway operation. The locomotive developed
enough power to move itself, with a four-passenger
car attached, and actually carried passengers. The
inventor took it to Dover, New Hampshire, and ex-
hibited it there, and also at Springfield, Massachus-
etts. Three years later, in a more developed state,
it attracted much interest at Boston.
Twelve years before Prof. Farmer, of Vermont,
devised this machine, in 1847, Thomas Davenport,
a blacksmith in the village of Brandon, Vermont,
installed an electric battery on a tiny car and ran
the car around a little circular track. In the next
year or so he built about a hundred such models,
but that is as far as the matter went until 1847,
when Farmer brought out the electric locomotive
described.
Wisconsin Taxes Municipal Plant
For the first time in the history of Wisconsin the tax
commissioners of that state are to levy an impost on a
municipal utility, the electric light plant of Stroughton
having made itself amendable to state taxation by ex-
tending its services outside the city. Stoughton will
be forced to apply to the Public Service Commission
for permission to increase its rates to meet the tax.
The Bureau of Mines has been cooperating with large
mining companies in the perfecting of devices to warn
miners of danger by means of stench. A vile smelling
liquid is introduced into the compressed air line and the
odor soon gives its warning through the nose.

This Article Received First Prize in the Technic's
Prize Article Contest
Serious thought is being given to the technical
narrowness of the engineering profession. People
are discussing it, magazines are condemning it, edu-
cators are deploring it, and we are submitting to it.
Before the war it was quite generally admitted
that engineering geniuses were responsible for our
country's prosperity as well as for its growing labor
difficulties. Technical men were one of the most
important factors in the war but with the present
labor strikes and unrest it appears that our society
is losing much of the benefits made possible for it
by the modern factory system. The individual is
losing his identity and giant combinations are tak-
ing his place. Under the present system of using
large scale production, a human being with a think-
ing mind is compelled to work as a machine. And
the present situation, with its almost universal dis-
satisfaction and seemingly insurmountable difficul-
ties, is attributed to the short-sightedness of the
engineer of the last century-
Engineering Colleges Automatic Machines
It is a most amazing fact that after volumes have
been written on the subject and even deans of col-
leges admit the diagnosis as true, engineering schools
continue to produce not growing professional men,
whom the world needs so badly, but mental labor-
ers. Almost every engineering college is like an
automatic screw machine. Its raw material is a
long line of freshmen. Held fast in the grip of its
curriculum they pass through the cutting tools in
four annual operations. And when they are shipped
to the public under the name of engineers, they, like
the screws, are good for only one kind of service
—that with the size, kind, and number of threads
formed in the sophomore and junior operations.
Students Are But Pieces of Steel
The general facts in the case cannot be empha-
sized too strongly, for mental inertia seems to have
prevented all previous written effort from achieving
the results intended. Perhaps a metaphor, cold and
hard like the simile above, may secure the situation
in the minds of students and executive powers.
An engineering student is a piece of steel; his
grit or carbon content is high and his possibility for
usefulness is large, depending upon the kind of tool
he .becomes in the processes of educating himself
(some people call it "being educated"). Engineer-
ing courses shape him into the kind of tool he is
to be, but they end with the cutting operations, and
he is put to work untempered and unpolished. It
should not be so. He is an expensive material and
he should be put through every treatment which
will make him a better tool. He should be harden-
ed, tempered, and ground, even though the immed-
iate cost of production is raised a little. The study
of economics is a hardening process, which makes
him ready to withstand the blows of commercial
competition. The study of literature is a tempering
process, which reduces his brittleness, making him
human. And a little grinding in the study of law
to remove the scale of prejudice and hearsay, is ne-
cessary to make him shine as an engineer.
It is generally admitted by students of engineer-
ing that it is a good thing to study in other depart-
ments, but they do not do it (except a few who take
EC. iE and feel educated). However, it is not their
fault, for they have grown up under quantity pro-
duction methods and are accustomed to believe that
the process they are put through is the best, as it
should be. The curriculum should be arranged so that
the student would be forced to become human and
be interested in other people. Some will say that a
student cannot be forced into being interested in
something he does not like; but he can- Such a
curriculum to a rhetoric-hating mind would serve
the same purpose as an A to a "shark". It is prac-
tically impossible to obtain an A in a course with-
out actually knowing ninety per cent of the work.
Even though the apparent goal is the A, the actual
goal is the knowledge obtained. The by-product be-
comes at the end of the semester the principal pro-
duct. It is so in the completion of a broad curricul-
um as a goal. The student is forced to absorb the
benefits of courses by taking them, and will uncon-
sciously become possessed of an intimate under-
standing of other people.

Better Knowledge of the Tool is Necessary
The three professions, theology, law, and medi-
cine, are called the "learned professions". There
would soon be four "learned professions" if engi-
neers were a uniformly well-educated class, as they
should be for the benefit of themselves and others.
The profession of engineering is simply the inverse
of the other three: theology, law, and medicine use
inert materials as tools, and human beings as their
material; engineering uses man as its only tool in
shaping inert physical materials. It will be gener-
ally conceded that any workman should know at
least as much about his tools as he does about the
materials he works with. Yet most engineering
students pay no attention to the only tool which
their profession uses and without which it could ac-
complish nothing.
The writer is aware of the fact that, so far, his
criticisms have been extremely harsh and destruc-
tive. And, if he were to stop here, there would be
no reason for publishing this article, for the same
topic has been ably discussed in several previous
issues of the Technic. But, as far as the writer
knows, all of them have left a question, not a plan,
in the minds of both students and faculty,
The solution seems so simple and obvious that it
is a wonder it wasn't in operation before any of us
saw Ann Arbor. What the engineer needs to make
him as liberally educated as any "lit", is a chance
to fulfill the requirements for an A.B. degree. In
most cases, a six year course, similar to the plan
used in the Law and Medical schools, will be ne-
cessary. It is true that many students would not
wish to study six years, and that others could not
afford to stay that long; but should that prevent at
least an equal number form receiving the benefits of
a full professional curriculum?
Two Courses Should Be Offered
There should be in the catalogue two courses for
an engineer to choose from. One should be a six
year course giving two degrees—an A.B. and a B.S.
The regular four year B.S. degree course should still
lie continued for those who have not the mental
courage or financial backing to take the other
course.
The old idea that engineering and literary studies
were incompatible has almost disappeared. We are
now beginning to see them as positive and negative
electrostatic charges—they actually attract each
other. And the "lit"students and faculty are not
such a care-free lot as we picture them. They are
really a good crowd, from which we can learn more
than we thought they knew.
Neither faculty will oppose the launching of a six
year course, for the engineering faculty has been
hoping for it for years, and the literary faculty is
anxious to give an A.B. degree to anyone who will
complete the required program. All that stands
in the way of what we all agree is desired, then, is
the inertia of custom and a few unimportant re-
strictive rulings. Let us all hope and insist that
the necessary powers get together and work out a
six year course to be printed in next year's cata-
logues. Then Michigan's great College of Engineer-
ing will begin in 192S to produce anuually a consid-
erable quantity of what the world needs so badly—
professional engineers.
A Textbook of Machine Drawing
"Machine Drawing," by Carl L. Svenson, M.E., As-
sistant Professor of Engineering Drawing in the
Ohio State University. D. Van Nostrand Com-
pany. 1921.
This volume is so written and arranged that a
careful study of its contents will constitute a short
cut to an understanding of the art of machine draw-
ing. It is a thorough treatise on the entire sub-
ject, written in an understandable manner, thus
making it of value to the beginner as well as the
experienced draftsman.
The first chapter is devoted to the use and care
of drawing instruments and the elementary prin-
ciples of machine drawing and the succeeding chap-
ters cover almost every other phase of the subject
Of particular importance is the chapter on gears and
cams, which, although a complete theoretical treat-
ment is not included, it is sufficient to introduce and
make familiar to the student, a subject which is
frequently found difficult. In company with the
subject to which they apply, are found several useful
tables. A noteworthy feature is the originality of
the two-hundred drawings. Frequently these are
seen to have been supplied by the trade, thus mak-.
ing a book serve as an advertising medium.
In view of the characteristics mentioned, this work
is recommended to the embryo engineer who is de-
sirous of becoming familiar with the essential sub-
ject of machine drawing.
A novel method has recently been worked out for
setting a black diamond in the end of a metal shaft
for use in turning down emery wheels. The old
process had been similar to that used in filling teeth,
the diamond simply being set in the end of a short
piece of steel about an inch long and 5/16 of an
inch in diameter- The new idea calls for a length
of copper wire attached to the diamond, which is
then set in a small mold the size of the finished
shaft. An alloy of aluminum and lead is then
heated and poured into the mold upon the stone
and around the wire. The resulting tool is much
more durable and efficient because the diamond is
held in place solidly and permanently.

With inevitable exhaustion of our natural oil supply
on a basis of the present knowledge of resources in
the not far distant future, indications are that the
future use of natural fuel oil and coal will be confined
to those uses where, broadly speaking, nothing else is
applicable. The approaching exhaustion of such
sources of energy undoubtedly means that other sources
of energy must be brought into use to take their place.
'California, along with many other States, has enjoy-
ed the advantage of abundant deposits of natural fuel
oil and gas and, is at present along with many other
States, looking to its future source of energy. This,
fortunately, it also has in abundance and, while its
present value may be its maximum, it is, so long as the
rains and snows fall upon its mountains and valleys,
inexhaustible. California's black, sticky crude oil will
be, and is being replaced as a source of energy in the
ways of commerce by the clear waters of its rivers and
lakes.
Four Principal Sources of Power
The present principal sources of California's water-
power, all of which are in some stage of development,
are four rivers, the Pitt, the Feather, the San Joaquin
(Big Creek) and the Kings River. It is only within
recent years, however, that the potential energy of
these streams has become available, due to the earlier
limitations of the radius of transmission and various
other factors. The estimated possible power develop-
ment for these four rivers is 1,711,000 kw.
The Feather River has three principal forks, known
as the North, Middle and South Forks. The prin-
cipal source for water-power purposes is the North
Fork in Plumas County, rising in a natural basin
known as Big Meadows, into which a number of
streams flow from the slopes of Mt. Lassen and other
peaks. There are also numerous springs in the basin
of considerable volume and of fairly constant flow.
The total length of the river measured along its North
Fork to its junction with the Sacramento, is approxi-
mately 140 miles. The available energy in the stream
is contained in the length from the source to Oroville,
a distance of approximately 75 miles. The total fall
in the river from the present spillway of Big Meadows
dam to Oroville is 4,285 feet. At the latter point, the
elevation above sea level is 170 feet.
This article is reprinted from Stone &amp; Webster Journal.
The cover of this issue is a view of the power house site
on the Feather River.
The area of the watershed tributary to Big Meadows
is 504 square miles. The area of the watershed tribu-
tary to the river between its sources and Oroville is
3,000 square miles. The total average yearly run-off
into Big Meadows basin, measured over a period of
thirteen years, is 842,000 acre feet.
Gold Rush Responsible for Caribou Development
In the early days of the settlement of California, all
the streams and rivers of the State were intensively
prospected for gold and the Feather River was in par-
ticular one of the great points of interest. The old
Caribou Trail, still visible to travelers through the
canyon, bears silent witness to the lure of the yellow
metal to the pioneers of those days, and it was one of
these same pioneers who finally conceived the idea of
utilizing the energy of the river itself to uncover the
gold in its bed. For this purpose a dam was built
across the river and a tunnel driven through the rock
at Big Bend. The Great Western Power Company
later acquired all the rights of the gold mining company
and . utilized the works in the design of the hydro-
electric development now known as Big Bend. This
plant was placed in operation in 1909, and operated
the first 100,000 volt transmission line in the world,
transmitting power to Oakland, a distance of 154 miles.
Later steps were taken by the Great'Western Power
Company towards a complete development of the river
and a comprehensive plan laid down.
In 1910 the Big Meadows dam was constructed to
conserve and partially control the flood waters of the
river. This dam is an earth-filled structure 600 feet
long and impounds approximately 300,000 acre feet
of water, forming Lake Almanor with an area of
15,500 acres and an average depth of 19.5 feet. By
raising the crest of the dam 28 feet, it would allow the
storage of 1,250,000 acre feet and make the area of
the lake 27,000 acres. As the total average yearly run-
off in the lake is 842,000 acre feet, the raising of the
dam to a height above that required to impound 842,-
000 acre feet, would only serve the purpose of con-
serving the occasional flood year waters and thus ob-
tain a more nearly uniform flow.
Unit Project Plan Followed
The plan of the ultimate development of the river
contemplates a series of seven power houses, all suc-
cessively utilizing the controlled waters of Lake Al-
manor in addition to the annual run-off of the water-

shed between the power houses and the lake. The
total head which will be utilized by the seven power
houses is 3,547 feet, or eighty-five per cent of that
available in the river. The total possible power de-
velopment is 486,000 kw. The largest single develop-
ment will be Caribou, with 120,000 kw.; the smallest,
25,000 kw. The highest single head, 1,008 feet; the
lowest, 270 feet. The total length of tunnels required
is approximately 103,000 feet, of which Caribou has
a considerable portion.

PENSTOCK LINE AND POWER HOUSE
Over Four Miles of Tunnel Required
Stone &amp; Webster, Inc., are at present constructing
the No. 2, or Caribou development for the Great West-
ern Power Company, the final capacity of which will be
120,000 kw. with six units; the present capacity will be
40,000 kw. The construction under way includes ap-
proximately 22,500 feet of tunnel, 2,200 feet of pipe
line, a dam in Butt Valley, a power house and its
equipment, together with various inclines, shafts, rail-
roads, etc.
The normal capacity of the present tunnels is 60,000
kw., with a maximum capacity of 80,000 kw., and the
ultimate development calls for their duplication.
Tunnel No. 2: from Lake Almanor to Butt Creek;
is 11,200 feet long, has an area of 46 square feet,
and a capacity of 800 second feet of water. It is
equipped with two 7-foot electrically controlled gates
at the lake end.
Tunnel No. 2: from the south end of Butt Valley
to the crest of the river gorge; is 9,750 feet long, with
an area of 78.50 square feet, and a capacity of 1,350
second feet of water. It is equipped with a 9-foot
electrically controlled gate at its entrance. Near its
lower end is a surge chamber 30 feet in diamater and.
150 feet deep, and at its lower end it connects with
pipe lines to the power house. The pipe line is 2,140
feet long, and the lower 1,530 feet are laid in a third
tunnel. The lines vary in diameter from 42 inches at
the bottom to 66 inches at the top.
Material is taken into the job from the main line of
the Western Pacific Railroad at Howells Station. At
this point a railroad, 9J4 miles long, has been con-
structed to the power house site. Due to the rough
character of the gorge, the take-off at Howells re
quired a swithback arrangement and bridge which con-
tains one million feet of timber. A narrow gauge,
motor operated incline leading from the power house
connects with a narrow gauge railroad that has been
constructed around the shoulder of the mountains lying
between the gorges of the Feather River and Butt
Creek. The level of this railroad is some 1,400 Icet
above the power house. Near its upper end another
incline reaches the approximate level of Butt Creek
diversion dam, and a third incline reaches the summit
of the mountain between Lake Almanor and Butt Val-
ley; a total length of narrow guage railroad of ap-
proximately ii miles. A sawmill is operated on the
job and a very large proportion of the timber used
for the tunnels and other work is cut and finished as
required by the job.
Six 20,000 K. W. Units Required
The power house is a reinforced concrete structure,
105 feet high, 104 feet wide, with a present length of
176 feet and an ultimate length of 308 feet. The ulti-
mate building will have six 20,000 kw. units, six main
transformer banks, four 165,000 volt lines and three
11,000 volt lines. The present installation is two 20,-
ooo kw. units, two exciters, two transformer banks,
one 165,000 volt line and one 11,000 volt line, and
space is provided for a third unit. The 20,000 kw.
units will each consist of two overhung impulse type
water wheels, having 21 buckets per wheel, operating
with a head of 1,008 feet and at a speed of 171.4 r.p.m.
Each bucket on the wheels weighs 1,000 pounds; the
jet diameter is 1 1 inches and the water consumption
approximately 336 cubic feet per second for each com-
plete unit. The power house is provided with a three
motor, 175-10n traveling crane.
The generators are rated 22,223 kva. at 90 per cent

power factor, three-phase, 11,000 volts and are Y
connected. The shaft of the unit weighs 20 tons and
has a diameter at the bearings of 24^ inches. Each
of the two bearings is 6 feet long. The total weight of
the revolving element of the unit is 170 tons, and of
the whole unit approximately 290 tons.

A VIEW of GENERATOR AND WATER WHEEL
Only one transmission line will be built at present.
It will run from the Caribou plant to Valona Sub-
station at Oakland, a distance of approximately 185
miles. Due to the difficulty of obtaining materials for
Valona Substation, it is expected that initial operation
of the new system will be at 110,000 volts. However,
as soon as the Substation can be completed, the volt-
age of the new system will be raised to 165,000 volts.
The Southern California Edison Co. has tiled an
application with the Federal Power Commission to
obtain the rights to build a 3,570,000 horse-power
project on the Colorado River in Utah and Ari-
zona. It involves the storage of the waters cf the
upper Colorado River and its tributaries in a hug'e
reservoir. This project will have a total hydraulic
fall of 2,650 feet.
The Consolidated Gas, Electric Light and Power
Company of Baltimore, has developed a "live-wire in-
dicator" to determine whether cables are energized or
not before working on them. The construction of this
"live-wire indicator" is such as to draw a loud buzzing
spark from a live high-tension line when properly at-
tached, thus giving the desired warning.
An earth fill dam 232 feet high—only eight feet be-
low the projected height of the ill fated Calaveras dam
which would have been the record structure of this
type—is now under construction by the United States
Reclamation Service on the Tieton River about 26
miles above Naches, Washington.
The French are now experimenting with a new gun
with which they expect to achieve a range of 200 miles.

Less Noise
By Major Willis Shippam
Coast Artillery Corps, U. S. Army
We all heard the rumble and noise made by the Uni-
versity R. O. T. C. tractor which hauled the 155 milli-
meter G. P. F. Gun thorugh the streets of Ann Arbor
on Armistice Day. Multiply this by two or three and
you will have some idea of the noise made by one trac-
tor or small tank of this size during the War. Larger
tanks and tractors make even more noise in propor-
tion to their size. Of course the element of surprise is
of great importance in battle so just at present the
Ordnance Department of the Army is putting much
study on the problem of reduction of noise in these
machines and they have the able assistance of a num-
ber of firms in civil life.
The muffling of the exhaust from the engine is a
comparatively simple problem. This demands a muf-
fler of sufficient size so that the noise of the exhaust
can be muffled without producing a serious back pres-
sure. The location of this muffler and exhaust pipe
from the engine is an important feature in the design
of tanks because of the heat which must be carried
away from the engine. The exhaust pipes usually have
fins so as to radiate as much heat as possible and are
located and protected so that the tank mechanic will
not be burned through contact. Changing speed in
tanks is accomplished through brake bands, with the
gears always in mesh. Epicyclic gears are used.


Wheeled Caterpillar for 155-MM Gun
The caterpillar tracks offer the greatest field for the
reduction of noise. It will be readily apparent that
when a single-track shoe is taken from rest on the
ground and accelerated to double the speed of the
vehicle on the top of the track, unless the construction
is mechanically correct there is a possibility for the pro-
duction of loud noise. The steel track rollers running
over this track also produce noise. To minimize these
effects as much as possible the designer must have a
thorough grasp of the underlying principles of cater-
pillar engineering. The track driving sprockets must be
raised somewhat off the ground so that the weight of
the vehicle will be carried by the supporting rollers un-
der the middle of the tank. This insures a gradual
change of direction of each track shoe and when taken
in connection with large diameter of track sprockets
and idlers tends to reduce the noise considerably. Rub-
ber-cored track rollers have been employed. These roll-

Operating as a Caterpillar
ers consist essentially of a solid truck wheel with dual
rubber tires, around the outside of which has been
fastened a steel rim which rides on the caterpiller
track rails and prevents injury to the rubber tire. The
rubber between the outer rim and the wheel is so ar-
ranged that it has sufficient space to expand, and thus
absorbs the shocks and deadens the noise. Means are
provided to prevent overloading of the rubber, so that
the load carried will be approximately the same as the
load carried by truck tires.
Rubber or other fabric has also been used on the
track driving sprockets and on the idler sprocket
where the track shoes some in contact with these sur-
faces, so as to reduce the noise of impact. Rubber pads
have likewise been applied to the bearing surface of
the track shoes themselves. Commercial tractors, when
used for industrial work in handling loads about large
shops, have been equipped with these rubber pads and
have performed satisfactorily.
Some of the first tests made of these devices were
on the mobile gun mount. (Shown by two pictures).
The gun is exactly the same as the one used by the
R. O. T. C. for instruction, but is mounted on a self
propelled mount capable of running at speeds up to
thirty miles an hour, forward or backward.
The advantage of noiseless tanks or tractors is ap-
parent. The most important factor in the success of
the first use of tanks was the element of surprise.
Noiseless tanks would enable tank concentrations to be
made without the enemy being aware of their presence,
so that tank attacks could be launched suddenly and
without counter-measures having been developed by
the enemy.


Said Minnie to Ann—that is how it began
In the most casual sort of a way,
"Your eleven is fine almost equal to mine,
And your ball team sure makes a good play,
Your fellows orate in a way that is great
And your glee club can hit up an air,
And in science and art, you have made a good start
And will no doubt come through with your thare.
You are located swell where the hillside and dell
Reach down to Huron's green slope,
So your scenic effects are in many respects
The equal of all we can hope;
In mpst ways I guess I will have to confess
We neither have much of a lead,
But you never would dare pretend to compare
Our faculties, O, no indeed.
'Tis true I have seen your Engineer Dean
And admit he has wonderful ways,
That smile and that wink are the cutest I think
I have seen, in all my born days;
There are others no doubt you feel boastful about
The way they can practice or preach,
But the one we have got who can beat the whole lot
Is our Prexy, O boy, he's a peach.
He's a regular guy, I'll say so, and I
Will slip you a reason or two
That will help put you wise to some wherefores
and whys
That you never would find in Who's Who.
At first be it known he is strictly home grown
Our own garden sass so to speak,
And like other great men he had to begin
On a pay of two dollars a week.
But he didn't mind, he wasn't that kind
He knew there was room at the top,
So he buckled right in with a bit of a grin
And never found out where to stop;
And I will just bet he'd be going yet
If we hadn't brought him to see
That the place for renown was his own native town
In spite of the Bible decree.
But there had been years both of triumphs and
tears
And the oil of the midnight hour
Since he'd gone forth a youth to seek for the truth
And knowledge and wisdom devour;
But you never can tell, no you never can tell
Who it is that will gain, the renown
As the old whale remarked when friend Jonah de-
barked
You can't keep a good man down.
So no matter where he went far or near
He seemed to fit in to scheme
Be it two-bones a week or Euclid or Greek
Or rooting a bit for the team;
The wisdom of Yale he drank from the pail
Including the cream and the whay
And every year he got another degree
Till they were all given away.
When he'd learned all that's known in this land of
his own
Then he went across over the pond,
And there learned to speak a new language each
week
Till he could almost pronounce Millerand.
In Bagdad or Rome he felt right at home
And he didn't find Petrograd slow
While on Champs Elysees in La Belle Belle Paris
He was soon just a part of the show.
When he'd spent most a year on the foreign frontier
And absorbed all worth taking away
Then he said "Au revoir, you have much I adore
But it's me for the U. S. A.
But please understand I admire every land
And the flags of all colors and hue
Any flag that I see is alright for me
Just so it's the red, white and blue.
Now Ann you'll agree I am sure now with me
That we're holding a place in the sun,
With a president who is all pep through and
through
You're all beat before you've begun;
So be not deceived nor yet be aggrieved
When you find through the years as I've said
That the school that will lead and all others exceed
Is the one in which Burton's the head."

Ann didn't get roiled she only just smiled
And said: "Minn perhaps you are right
You generally are, or at least are not far
From the truth, in the facts you recite;
Some college must lead that we all must concede
If through fortune or favor or fate
. But there's many a slip twixt the hip and the lip
That sometimes you can't estimate."
A year, perhaps more, had gone by before
Minnie had any cause to recall
What she'd told Ann that day in a prophetic way,
And then it all came like a squall;
She saw then too late how she'd unlocked the gate;
The rest 'twas not hard to surmise,
All she said was: "By gee! you will have to show me
That it pays to advertise."
How 'twas all brought about is involved in some
doubt
And they are not telling, who can,
But being leap year it seemed very clear
That we could just leave it to Ann;
We perhaps must admit Ann flirted a bit
But even our Dean don't condemn
An artful display of a maid's winsome way,
When it's only a means to an end.
And the one fact that Ann won for old Michigan
Is the fact that is really worth while,
With Burton secured our lead is assured
We can beat all the others a mile;
We believe thoroughly in the wise prophecy
Which Minnie so aptly expressed,
Especially when it's the good U. of M.
That's chosen to lead all the rest.
Then let's muster our might as old grads tonight
And raise three good rousing old cheers
For our Prexy serene and our good genial Dean
And his staff of select engineers,
We are with you today and we're with you alway,
Though the years may be many or few,
So here's to the clan who are boosters for Ann,
And here's to the yellow and blue.
An instrument designed to record the vibrations
caused by modern city traffic is so delicate that it will

A New Phase in Engineering Education
BY ROBERT R. MC!NTOSH '23E
An Analysis of the Connection Between "Human
Engineering" and the Engineer Student
For years it has been the custom for Engineering
students to spend four years in theoretical training
and then step out into the industrial world and gain
by hard knocks the rest of the experience required to
make them successful engineers.
By degrees there is now creeping into the curricu-
lum of engineering schools a new subject, one which
is as vitally necessary as mathematics or any of the
multitude of studies which must be taken for gradua-
tion. This subject has come to be called, "Human En-
gineering," by its backers, and it gains its name directly
from the ground it covers, namely, the analysis of
human types and human nature.
The industrial engineer, whatever branch he hap-
pens to be engaged in following, comes in closer con-
tact, perhaps, with more varieties of human beings
than any other professional man. His work lies close-
ly connected with seething life of the common mass,
and it is essential that he should be able to direct,
sympathize with, and secure the allegiance of that
mass before he can mount to the position of a leader
and become a "successful'' engineer.
Realizing how important this matter has grown,
one of the most prominent mining colleges in the world.
a college which graduates men who succeed, has adopt-
ed a plan to aid the student in a preparatory course
for the study of human types and nature. This end
is accomplished by securing the aid of big men in
the mining world, who willingly come to the college
and give up their valuable time so that those who step
into their places in the not distant future, may benefit
by their experiences in the past. One hour each week
is devoted to the course. No credit is given for attend-
ance and yet it is noticeable that practically the entire
student body turns out at the scheduled hour. No
professor is allowed to encroach upon that hour. In
addition, students from the college are encouraged to
help in the education of foreigners in the district, and
thus have a chance to get in personal touch with the
men with whom they must work in the future. The
plan is an ideal one and is receiving enthusiastic sup-
port.
It seems a shame that the idea cannot be taken up by
all engineering schools, but at present slow progress is
being made. Having once started such a course, how-
ever, it is usually found to be a worth-while addition
to the engineer's education, and receives impetus from
the interest manifested.
The adoption of such a plan has not yet been brought
before the Faculty of the University, although adher-
ents are backing it to secure a position as one of the
Engineer's strongest subjects.

President Stout Engineering Laboratories
Recent developments are bringing into prominence
the absolute surety that future airplanes will be built
of metal. While this will fundamentally be true with
Army fighting planes, it will of necessity come true in
connection with Navy and commercial work.
The type of plane needed for work over water is
entirely different and the conditions are quite ex-
treme, in comparison with land aircraft. For ex-
ample, the Navy FsL, flying boat, equivalent to the
"Santa Maria" which visited Detroit last year, soaks
up as high as 1,600 pounds of water, thus making it al-
most impossible for that type of boat or airplane to
fly in a rainstorm. Fabric wings soak up a surprising
amount of moisture even on a damp day, and for this
reason alone, the metal ship must dominate for water
work or for commercial work where every pound of
payload means added profit.
The first example of a complete all-metal airplane
seen in America was the German Junker plane, market-
ed in this country by Mr. John Larsen of New York.
All advertising to the contrary, this is not an Amer-
ican-built plane in any sense, but German through-
out.
Junker Plane Remarkable Step Forward
In spite of this fact, a great deal of credit must be
given to this design. I understand that it was origin-
ally a biplane of the enclosed-cabin type, but proved
too heavy. When the upper wing was removed and
the machine flown as a monoplane, however, so sur-
prising a performance was secured that the plane was
left in that condition.
Its structure is ingenious, but crude. In appearance
it resembles a flying washboard with its corrugated
covering, but in fact, outside of the very faulty engine
installation, it is one of the most economical flying ships
ever constructed.
Experimental work on this plane was very hurried-
ly done during the latter part of the war, and the
construction showed it. At that time it was necessary
that Germany create a quantity type of airplane for her
armies on very short order, and she certainly succeeded
in this plane. The Junker plane made the trip from
Omaha to Philadelphia, non-stop, with two men. Sev-
eral of them have flown from New York to San Fran-
cisco and return on several occasions. Their use in the
aerial mail was very disastrous on account of the fire
danger of the faulty engine and tank installations, but
with the original engine fitted—which was not quite
powerful enough for the ship—this plane got eight
miles a gallon with five passengers. It was slow and
lumbering in getting off the ground and required a long
run after landing, but as a step in development was
a remarkable construction.
Weight vs. Workmanship
Far better in construction, but not quite so good
aerodynamically, was the Dornier flying boat which
followed the Junker. This is a beautiful piece of
workmanship, built entirely of duralumin, of flat,
uncorrugated sheet construction, but heavy. Like the
Junker, it is very logy when any real load is taken
aboard. It would seem in the German constructions
that the better the workmanship they put on a plane,
the heavier it gets, for in their third attempt, the
Staaken-Giant, built by the Zepplin Company for work
between Friedrischafen and Berlin, weights ran up to
such an extent that although the plane, aerodynamic-
ally, was a wonderful job, and, fitted with its 1,000-
horsepower engines was very fast, yet the weight of
the structure was so great that it had a wing loading
of i6-pounds per square foot. This plane was flown
very successfully on a number of occasions, but on ac-
count of the heavy wing loading required a landing
speed of 81 miles an hour, which made it far from
practicable.
In this country both the Navy and Army have been
experimenting very definitely, with all-mental construc-
tion. Naturally, details of this cannot be given out,
but one can only state that all-metal airplane construc-
tion in this country is far in advance of anything which
has been constructed abroad to date, either in Ger-
many, France, Holland, Great Britain, or any other
foreign country.
Duralumin Mainly Used in Construction
The metal used for the construction of all these
planes is mainly duralumin. This is a copper-alum-
inum alloy, invented in France, developed in Germany
and controlled in this country by the Chemical Founda-
tion. It has about the same strength as cold rolled

In considering the joys and sorrows connected
with the engine room of the Motor-Shop the reader
might stop to consider the rapid progress made by
designers and constructers along these lines in the
last few years. The Motor-Ship of today is the
neatest, cleanest floating structure that man ever
placed on water. I have seen engine rooms of Motor-
Ships after twenty-day trips that were as clean
as the salon on that same ship. In contrast to this
almost ideal condition I am by means of the follow-
ing description of my experiences going to give a
few of the "joys" experienced in general by the pio-
neer operators of the Motor-Ships. I happen to be
one of the younger of the "lucky devils of a few
years ago."
Shortly after the War I joined a wooden Motor-

Forward View of Winton Diesel Engine
Ship of 3,000 gross tons. She was equipped with
a small watertube donkey boiler for driving the
cargo winches, the windlass, and the bilge and fire
pumps. The ship having been in the tropics the
previous voyage had her bottom full of worms and
worm holes, but somehow these had escaped the
scrutiny of the inspectors.
Two days out of New York found us leaking at
the rate of two inches an hour. A heavy blow in-
creased the rate to almost four. The donkey boiler
and bilge pumps were kept in continuous operation.
The boiler, being oil fired with steam injection blast,
used up twenty-five per cent of all water fed into
it, and it was only a few days before we ran short of
fresh water. The skipper refused to turn back and
the Chief had no other course than to mix salt water
with the fresh. The water tube boiler stood up
exactly thirty-six hours under this treatment. Time
and again the engineers jumped into the hot boiler
and plugged the tubes. When our plugs gave out
we resorted to cement. The water rose above the
engine crank cases and we were obliged to stop the
engines. For five days we lay rolling in the trough
of the sea, fighting the water, and during that time
the four engineers got about three hours sleep a day.
The U. S. A. transport Great Northern answered our
wireless signals and lay off our bow for eight hours
passing us fresh water, cutting and threading four
inch pipe for the new bilge suction lines, and turning
up new steel boiler tube plugs for the boiler. With
this aid we got ahead of the water, bailed out the
engine crank cases, and started up. The crank shatt
and bearing had been under water for five days but
gave us no trouble when started. We finished the
voyage with colors flying.
On one trip returning from Europe we were in
rock ballast. The skipper had dumped all the bal-
last in the middle hold which brought the propellers
near the surface. After leaving the Azores we head-
ed into a prolonged blow. Each time the stern rose
the propellers came free and the engines raced vio-
lently. The governors were too slow acting to take
effect until the propellers were submerged again.
After five days of the racing, the engines had shaken
all gaskets loose and had become veritable foun-
tains. All our efforts to stop the leaking of the cool-
ing water were in vain. To add to our troubles the
exhaust valves commenced burning out at the rate
of two or three a day. The valves were not in cages,
and we had to pull the cylinder head for each valve.
The last voyage I made I signed on a Motor-Ship
at Gulfport, Miss., as First Assistant engineer. She
was bound for South America. We were off the
north coast of Cuba, when, one morning without
warning, the port engine flywheel fell off into the
bilges. There had been a slight wabble of about
1/32 of an inch, or less due to an untrue fit on the
shaft. This in running strained the shaft which
crystallized and broke off. We put into Havana
where we waited a month for a new compressor
shaft.

Shortly before passing Barbados, the Third As-
sistant allowed the lubricating oil tube to the tor-
ward chain gears to become plugged up and the
gear bushings were badly ground out. As we had
no lathe aboard, it was necessary to put in at Bar-
bados..
The worst trouble I ever experienced, and I am sure
that engineers are few and far between who have seen
worse, happened on the last leg of the journey home.
In Rio de Janeiro we were forced to bunker fuel oil.
We took the oil straight from the tanker the day she

Motor Ship Mount Baker, Loaded and Ready to Sail
arrived in port and put to sea ourselves that evening.
At 2:00 A. M. the following morning, both engines
stopped. Examination showed the fuel line to be full
of salt water. That salt water played havoc for us the
rest of the journey. The oil we got was the first taken
out of the bottom of the tanker. Tankers use sea
water as balast, and we got that part of the hallast
that they neglected to pump out before loading. The
water was well churned with the oil, and rough weather
made it impossible to settle it out.
As we neared Barbados that trip, both engine crank
cases began to heat up all over. We could find no
localized spot heating. Compression was blowing past
the rings so badly that at times I could see sparks
shooting into the crank cases. Deciding that the hot
cylinder gases blowing into the crank cases were do-
ing the heating, I stopped one engine at a time, and
working the whole engine crew, we pulled the sixteen
pistons and freed the rings, most of which were stuck.
The rings and cylinders were badly worn out of round,
and new rings were useless, not fitting in the oval
shaped cylinders.
However the heating continued and "all hands be-
low" being exhausted, the chief demanded the skipper
to put into St. Thomas where we could work with some
kind of ease. There we found that the bearings had
been ground put almost 1/8 inch. Careful examination
of the lubricating oil showed it to be full of fine par-
ticles of fused salt and carbon. This was a direct pro-
duct of the salt water in the fue oil, and its grinding
effect had caused the heat. Several crank pins had
been ground out of round 0.062 inch and all the pins
were in poor condition. The engine room force work-
ed for seven days from 7:00 A. M. until 12:00 P. M.
till at last we were ready to put to sea again.
We installed temporary cloth bag filters in the lubri-
cating oil system, but these fouled so quickly that they
were of no use, and the wire gauze strainers let the fine
partices through. In three days the trouble started
again. For two weeks we ran alternately on one engine
then the other while we repaired the bearings and
freed the rings. I was the only licensed engineer
standing watch in the engine room, and after the Chief
played out, had to assume complete responsibility.
During that time I got about two hours sleep a day,
and twice I was in the engine room working for sixty
hours. Besides the bearings, our compressers gave us
trouble, and four times we accomplished the feat of
raising the compresser cylinders, while the ship was
rolling in the trough of the seas, and replacing the worn
and broken rings. Then, of course, the valves found
that the salt gave a good excuse to burn out, and one
man was kept busy grinding valves. It took an hour
for two men to change a cyinder head in which a valve
had to be replaced, and we changed on an average
of three a day. To make misery complete the food
aboard ran short and we lived for a week and a half
on salt horse, beans, and rice. A hard working man
needs good food, and this diet nearly laid the engine
room crew on their backs. However, we pulled through
somehow, and on New Year's morning of 1921 we
dropped the hook in Galveston, Texas.
As the channel tug pulled along side, her cook was
carrying a pan of hot roasted potatoes to the mess
room. I hailed him and begged for one. "What you
got aboard that I want?" he asked. I shoved a bottle
of Trapechee wine over the rail and promptly received

"Digging Under;" Ope Coast of Brazil,
the whole pan of potatoes. The engineers had a New
Year's feast of hot roasted potatoes while the tug's
cook smacked his lips over good Italian wine.
These few experiences are just incidents among
many similar ones experienced by early Diesel oper-
ators. The modern Motor-Ship is entirely lacking in
such "joys", but she has come to stay, and in a *ery
few years the tramp freighter pouring black srmke
from her stack will be a curiosity to the mariner.


COLLEGE NOTES


EDITED BY ROBERT L. NEALE
U. of M. Expert Explains Need of Saving Gasoline
U. S. Supply Would be All Gone in 13 Years
at Present Rate of Usage
By E. H. Leslie,
Associate Professor of Chemical Engineering
At present petroleum is being produced faster than
It is being used, and stocks of gasoline are increasing.
Crude oil produced in Oklahoma has dropped in
price from $3.50 to $i per barrel, and the price of
gasoline has been lowered several cents per gallon.
But one must not be misled by the present situation,
-which is only a part of the business cycle through
which we are passing. It is a peculiarity of the oil
producing business that the drilling of new wells
reaches a maximum at the crest, or even after the
crest, of the wave of prosperity. The result is an
over production of crude oil in the time of depres-
sion. Prices drop, profits vanish, and new drilling
stops. But within a year or two the pendulum
swings the other way, and again there is a scarcity
of oil due to the interruption of drilling in the time
of depression. This cycle of events would take
place even if there were an endless supply of crude
oil underground.
The real motor fuel problem is not concerned
with the swings of the business pendulum, although
the present abundance of fuel is pointed to by
superficial critics as showing how wrong have been
the predictions of the scientists that have warned
us of a future shortage.
Supply Outgrowing Demand
The problem arises in part through the fact that
the underground reserve of petroleum is limited. At
present the unmined reserve of the United States
is only about 5,800,000,000 barrels. Were this oil
to be extracted from the ground at the rate equal to
that of the year 1920, a feat that is quite out of the
question from a practical standpoint, the reserve
would only last 13 years. It is thus evident, how-
ever, that after a few years we must expect a decline
in the domestic production of petroleum.
On the other hand, the use of automobiles, tract-
ors, trucks, and gasoline engines is becoming more
general. Only twenty-five years ago there were but
four automobiles in the country. One was in a cir-
cus, another was used for exhibition purposes, and
two were regarded as mechanical freaks. Today the
total number of registered motor vehicles is over
9,000,000,000, an almost unbelievable increase in the
short period of twenty-five years. What is more,
the number is still growing, and will probably ex-
ceed 13,000,000 within a few years.
A New Chemical Process Impractical
Where are we to get the fuel to run this vast
number of cars? So far there has been little dif-
ficulty as we have depended largely on great
draughts upon natural deposits. True enough, we
have changed the nature of the commodity we know
as gasoline. Its boiling range, that is the range of
temperature over which it distills, has been broad-
ened, with the result that the amount of gasoline ob-
tained from a barrel of crude oil has been increased
30 to 75 per cent. Also, gasoline has been extracted
from natural gas by processes involving either com-
pression and cooling, or oil-washing and cooling.

And, too, we have produced "synthetic gasoline" or
"cracked gasoline" on a moderate scale. The pro-
cesses for the production of these last named fuels
involve the heating of the oil in liquid or vapor form.
At the present time these gasolines comprise 15 to
20 per cent of the total quantity of gasoline market-
ed. The development and more extensive use of
these processes may be expected. It is probable
that their use will be the most important means of
bridging the gap between present and future sources
of fuel.
The quality of market gasoline will not change
greatly within the next few years, at least not until
the automotive engineers perfect devices that will
handle heavier and less volatile gasoline satisfactor-
ily.
In spite of the fact that for several years the
United States has produced two-thirds of the world's
oil, we have recently been dependent upon foreign
sources of supply of crude oil. Eighty per cent of
the world's oil is consumed in this country. In 1920
our imports were 110,000,000 barrels, or 25 per cent
of our domestic production. This oil came largely
from Mexico. As the years pass, the United States
will become more and more dependent upon imports
of petroleum. This will mean higher prices and
therefore necessitates more efficient utilization once
the oil is in this country.
What other possible sources of fuel are there?
Much has been heard of shale oil and of alcohol.
Neither of these commodities will be important as
motor fuels until many far-reaching developments
have taken place. The development of a shale oil
industry on a scale sufficient to furnish large quanti-
ties of motor fuel is an undertaking comparable to
the whole coal mining industry of today. And to
produce alcohol we must first have available suitable
raw material. It is quite out of the question to make
large quantities of fuel alcohol from food materials
such as grain and potatoes. Possibly wood may be
the future source of alcohol, and reforestation of
waste areas, the means of supplying the wood.
Probable Relief Through Motor Development
Lastly it is probable that necessity will be the
mother of invention in methods of utilizing fuels.
Present engines and devices for carburetion will be
modified in such a way that where we now drive a
car 10 to 20 miles on a gallon of gasoline, we shall
later be satisfied only with 20 to 40 miles. . The
chemists will be called upon to study what happens
within the engine cylinders and to find means of
producing more salutary results.
Let us not allow the momentary over-supply of
gasoline to blind us to the real situation. The co-
operation of scientists, commercial interests, public,
and government is needed for the successful solution
of the problem.
Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering
A systematic series of experiments is being con-
ducted in the Naval Tank to determine the effect
of the shape of sections of a ship upon the water
resistance. While a certain amount of work nas
been done upon this subject for isolated cases, the
problem has not so far, been attacked for all possible
types of vessels. In other words, the object of the
experiments will be to determine the effect of varia-
tion of the vertical prismatic coefficient upon the re-
sistance of vessels.-
Professor Sadler was appointed some time ago to
act upon a Government Committee to advise the
Secretary of Commerce as to the fixing of load lines
for vessels. The work of the committee has been
divided into three sections, one for the east coast,
one for the west coast and one for the Great Lakes.
Professor Sadler is chairman for the last mentioned
district and has had Professor Lindblad, also of the
department, associated with him in the analysis of
the various types of lake vessels.
Changes in Disciplinary Measures
The work of the Faculty Discipline Committe last
year included the disposition of such cases as those
of men submitting complete sets of lab notes, field
notes, and tracings which did not represent their
own work. Such instances are obviously violations
of the principles of the Honor System and should,
but do not, fall within its scope.
The Faculty Discipline Committee has suggested
that the remedy for these undesirable conditions is
to be found only by incorporating in the present
Honor System some rules similar to those which
have proven so successful in the conducting of blue
books and final examinations.
This would necessitate the adoption of an addi-
tion to the present rulings of the Honor System.
It is with this in mind that the Honor Committee
suggests that the question be considered and
brought up for discussion in the January class meet-
ings.
The number of farms which had automobiles on Jan-
ory 1, 1920, according to a recent announcement of the
Bureau of Census, Department of Commerce, was
1'979.564 or 30.7 per cent of all farms in the United
States. These farms reported a total of 2,146,512 au-
tomobiles on the census date.
Continuous printing is the latest improvement in
the making of blueprints. A long strip of sensitized
paper moves steadily through the machine and is print-
ed, developed, and dried at the uniform rate of five
feet a minute.

Dean Cooley Honored
On October 8th it was announced that Mortimer
E. Cooley, Dean of the College of Engineering and
Architecture, University of Michigan, was chosen as
President of the American Engineering Council of
the Federated American Engineering Societies. He
succeeds Herbert Hoover, who resigned upon ac-
cepting the position of Secretary of Commerce in
President Harding's cabinet.
This new position
brings much honor to
Dean Cooley, but the
probelms confronting the
Organization show that it
is going to be a real man's
job. The problems arc
varied, dealing with social,
political, economic, and
technical matters. He will
have to cope with the very
serious unemployment sit-
uation and with several
problems dealing with
Government Reorganiza-
tion, such as the establish-
ment of a Department of
Public Works and reforms
in the United States Pat-
ent Office. The Council
is opposing the passage of
the Stanley Senate Bill, re-
quiring that Patents to
Aliens be granted with a
condition that, unless such
Patents be worked in this
Country within two years
after their granting, the
Government may grant
licenses under them. Other questions confronting
the Council are those of legislation by the various
States on the registration of Engineers, elimination
of industrial waste, and regional organization of
the Engineers of the Country.
It is said of Dean Cooley by fellow engineers that
he is one of the biggest and broadest minded engi-
neers in the country and that he never seeks a
position but the position seeks him.

Dean Mortimer E. Cooley
Engineering Building, the west half of which is to
be torn down to make room for the library.
The exterior dimensions of the structure are to
be approximately 78x94 feet. In addition to this,
considerable space will be taken up by a wide ap-
proach leading to the library.
The entrance to the building leads directly into
the large main reading room which occupies the
greater part of the interior. This room will extend
through both stories of the structure; at its rear a
number of smaller study
rooms will have their
openings. Rooms for the
Library staff and a vault
for the storage of valu-
able documents will also
have places on the main
floor, as well as an office
for a professor of Amer-
ican History, with which
the collection is chiefly
concerned. On the second
floor will be a balcony
overlooking the main
reading room ; also a num-
ber of cases for the stor-
age and exhibition of
semi-valuable papers and
a place for their perusal.
A number of eighteenth
century newspapers form
a very important part of
the collection, which are
to be found in the base-
ment.
Upon the completion of
the building the Univer-
sity will have one of the
most comprehensive col-
lections on American History in the country.
The New Clements Library
One of the buildings that is soon to be seen on
the campus is the new Clements Library. The
building will face South University Avenue and
will stand partly on what is now the site of the Old
Aeronautical Society Reorganized
The reorganized Aeronautical Society, with the
purpose of increasing the interest of the campus in
aeronautics, extends an invitation to all who are in-
terested, to become members. The purpose of the
Society is to stimulate interest in aviation, and to
promote social fellowship among the members.
At one of the earlier meetings this year, Profes-
sor Pawlowski, of the Aeronautical Department,
gave an interesting talk on the experimental work
in Aeronautics being carried on by the Government.
At a later meeting, Mr. E. A. Stalker, instructor in
the Aeronautical Department, lectured on "Aero-
plane Stability," giving a practical demonstration

with models. Mr. W. B. Stout, President of the
Stout Engineering Laboratories of Detroit, recently
gave a most interesting discussion on the all-metal
aeroplane. He is one of several men prominent in
the aeronautical profession who it is hoped will
talk to the members of the Society in the near
future.
Prof. Gordy Heads New Course in Industrial
Engineering
Professor Gordy, one of the new men at Mich-
igan this year, has been instrumental in securing a
new and novel course in industrial egineering- This
course which will be known as M. E. 36, is open to
all senior and graduate students who have com-
pleted M. E. 35.
This course will be primarily concerned with shop
management. Individual problems will be assigned
to each man. The problems will have to do with the
management of shops and factories and will be car-
ried out in plants in Ann Arbor and Detroit. Some
of the plants already secured for this work are the
American Blower Co. and Park Davis Co. of Detroit,
and the Machine Specialty Co. of Ann Arbor. The
work will require one or two afternoons a week.
One type of problem will concern shop layout.
Other problems will deal with store room arrange-
ment and control. This method of giving the stu-
dent some practical work along with his theoretical
study should prove a good thing. Professor Gordy
will visit the men once every week or two and will
also give private consultation at his office.
Track Prospects for 1922
The jinx setting on Steve Farrell's neck this year
seems to be ineligibility. If all the men he has out
now weather the finals in February, the prospects
for a good year in track will be bright. A number
of last year's men are back and working hard, but
there is a lack of men from the class of '24.
The men out this year are:
loo and 220 yard—Captain Simmons, Martin, and
Burke.
440 yard—Joiner, Louis, and Thomas.
Half mile—Douglas, Weeks, and Hattendorff.
Mile—Standish, Randt, and Bowen.
Two mile—Davis and Chute. Davis made a rec-
ord for the three-mile course on last year's freshman
team.
High hurdles—Sargent.
Low Hurdles—Sargent and Schmidt.
Weights—Van Orden, Stipe, and Schmidt.
Discus—Dunne.
Javelin—Dunne and Hoffman- Hoffman holds
the Conference record for this event.
High Jump—Smith, Walker, and Ward.
Pole vault—Landowski, Naylor, and Lally.
Basketball
Coach Mather is not optimistic about the basket-
ball prospects this year, because of the loss of so
many of last year's players. Rea, Miller, Whitlock,
Reason and Piper being the only ones left. Duke
Dunne's entrance into the Law school eliminates a
fast center and LeGalley will probably, not be able
to play, due to entering the Medical school.
Ely has shown considerable ability as a center
and Paper, Hoyt, Lipman, Johnson and Piper are
possibilities as guards. These men, with Kipke,
Uteritz, Roby and Cappon of the football squad,
comprise the backbone of the team. MacWood and
MacGregor are other possibilities. The original
number of seventy-five men who reported for prac-
tice, has been cut to about twenty-five.

Major Brooks of the Ordnance Unit, R. O. T.C.
The officer in command of the new Ordnance
Unit, Major Brooks, has had a very interesting
career previous to coming to Michigan. He grad-
uated from West Point in 1914 and was commis-
sioned 2nd Lieutenant, C. A. C.; he served at Fort
Monroe, Va., and Fort Dade, Florida. In July, 1916,
he was commissioned ist Lieutenant, C. A. C.
From Sept., 1916, to April, 1917, he was student of-
ficer, Ordnance School of Application, Sandy
Hook, N. J-; and successively Proof Officer, Officer
in Charge of Experimental and Development Work,
and Chief Proof Officer until August, 1919. At that
time he was transferred to Aberdeen proving
grounds. In 1917, he was commissioned Captain in
C. A. C. Major, Ordnance, National Army in 1918,
and temporary Lt. Col. Ordnance, August, 1919. He
was later given a commission as Major, R. A., and
transferred to the Ordnance Department and in De-
cember, 1920, was stationed at Camp Grant, Ill., as
Ordnance Officer where he remained until coming
to Michigan to organize an Ordnance Unit in the
R. O. T. C.

Makes Photos of Noise of Motor Gears
With the aid of an oscillograph an experimenter
can measure the difference in time between the ex-
plosion of the two ends of a stick of dynamite—
about one ten-thousandth of a second, or the varia-
tions in the noise of motor gears which are too
slight to be heard.
This, roughly, is the operation of an oscillo-
graph: Suppose a "picture" were being made of
the exploding stick of dynamite. Two wires carry-
ing current from a battery are passed through the
two ends of the stick and connected to the oscillo-
graph in its 8 by 8 by 36 inch mahogany box, set
any distance away. Inside that box are two tightly-
strung loops of finest wire, each with a speck of a
mirror stuck on it. These wires are hung in a gap
between two poles of a magnet, and in the same
plane as the lines of magnetic force between the
poles. When current is passed through the loops,
they tend to twist themselves at right angles to
their former positions, the amount of twist being
proportional to the amount of current in them.
Thus, as the current oscillates, the loops twist a
part turn, first one way and then the other. Fine
beams of arc light directed at an angle against the
infinitesimal mirrors are reflected through a slit in
the mahogany box against a passing strip of film.
One of the loops is connected with the two wires
from the stick of dynamite. It takes a "jump" as
each wire breaks in the explosion, and each "jump"
makes a peak in the white line this loop's needle of
light is registering on the film. The other loop os-
cillates at a regular cycle rate, so that its record on
the film is so many jiggles per second. This is the
"time wave." By comparing the first with the sec-
ond, it is easy to tell the exact time that elapsed
between the explosions of the two ends of the stick.
Studies of sound, such as that of an automobile
gear are made by using different methods of con-
necting the oscillograph to the experiment. In the
case of the automobile gear, an ordinary telephone
mouthpiece is held close to the gear teeth. The
variations of sound it catches are marked by high
peaks on the film so accurately that the operator,
if he is skillful, can tell by the film just what each
tooth in the gear is doing.
THE ALL-METAL AIRPLANE
(Continued from Page 18)
steel and weighs one-third as much, can be forged,
rolled, drawn into wire or extruded into tubing, and by
heat-treatment can be widely varied in strength and
hardness specifications. The Zepplin firm in Germany
and two research centers in this country use steel in
connection with duralumin for wing spars. Two oth-
ers equally prominent use duralumin entirely for the
entire structure. It will be interesting to see which
school of design obtains the lightest weight for the
greatest strength.
It is understood that steel in tensile strength is much
lighter than duralumin, but since tensile is not the prob-
lem but rather compression or column strength of spar
sections, duralumin through its greater thickness and
volume has a greater strength possibility than steel,
even in high alloys.
Metal constructions combined with thick wing de-
signs such as are now becoming universal for commer-
cial and heavy-lift aircraft work, are doing much to
cut the operation cost and upkeep requirements of air-
craft in two. The near future will see planes carry
passengers at a cost per mile less than an ordinary
limousine. Even now, ten miles a gallon with five
passengers is accomplished.
Future airplanes will be constructed of metal, and
those who are studying aircraft will do well to fol-
low closely every development in steel and duralumin,
rolled sections or tubing, that they may keep up-to-
date with those developments which must come before
air travel will be a real commercial fact.
The railroads use about one-fourth of the coal
mined in the United States. In 1918 the coal pro-
duction was 678,211,000 tons, of which the railroads
used 163,000,000 tons.

PANAMA CANAL EMERGENCY DAMS
/"lATUN LAKE, eighty-five feet above sea level, is the reservoir
^•^ holding the water to feed the Gatun Locks (which lead to the
Atlantic) and the Miraflores and Pedro Miguel locks on the Pacific end of
the canal.
Every ship going through the canal in either direction uses the water from
Gatun Lake to lift it from the one ocean and lower it into the other.
Should some accident destroy a lock, the weight of the water released
might force down the others and cause tremendous damage and, by lower-
ing the level of the lake, make the canal inoperative until rain had refilled
the lake.
Therefore these big emergency dams were constructed. Normally they
arc not used. In emergencies they would be swung over the locks, the gates
would drop into position and effectually dam the opening.
Otis engineers designed, constructed and installed the machinery for
operating six of these gigantic dams. It is a feat typical of the world-wide
scope of Otis activities in engineering and the vertical transportation of
men and materials.
Most of the famous buildings of the world
are equipped with Otis Elevators.

What Is Water Japan?
JAPAN — not the country but a metal-coating varnish—
^ and your morning bottle of milk. Totally unlike, yet
associated!
Ordinary japan consists of a tough, rubbery, tar-like "base"
and a highly inflammable "solvent." The solvent dilutes
the base so that the metal may be coated with it easily. The
presence cf the solvent involves considerable fire risk, espe-
cially in the baking oven.
Milk is a watery fluid containing suspended particles of
butter fat, so small that one needs the ultra-microscope to de-
tect them. An insoluble substance held permanently in sus-
pension in a liquid in this manner is in "colloidal suspension."
The principle cf colloidal suspension as demonstrated in
milk was applied by the Research Laboratories of the General
Electric Company to develop Water Japan. In this com-
pound the particles of japan base are colloidally suspended
in water. The fire risk vanishes.
So the analysis cf milk has pointed the way to a safe
japan. Again Nature serves industry.
Connected wuh the common things around us are many
principles which may be applied to the uses of industry with
revolutionary results. As Hamlet said, "There are more
things in Heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in
your philosophy."

It is well known that nowhere is the system of transportation of cargo in bulk
developed to a higher degree of efficiency than in the Great

Bulk Freighters of the Great Lakes
By A. F. Lindblad
Assistant Professor of Naval Architecture
The greatest development of cargo handling in
the world has taken place on the Great Lakes, and
nowhere is cargo in bulk transported and handled
at a lower cost. Iron ore, grain, and coal are the
commodities which form the main part of the trade;
but a large amount of stone, lumber, and general
cargo is also carried. This latter kind of cargo,
however, is usually transported by vessels of other
types than the typical Bulk Freighters, which will
be described in this article.
The iron ore and the grain are shipped eastward
from the ports on Lake Superior to the lower
Lakes: to Chicago and to the Lake Erie ports. The
coal is moved in the opposite direction.
Statements show that there has been some fluc-
tuation in the amounts carried during different
years. Last year, for example, the shipments were
unusually small, owing to the general economic de-
pression in this country. Only 22.3 million tons of
iron ore were sent down to Lake Erie ports against
nearly 60 million tons during the season of 1918.
There is, however, every reason to believe that the
trade is still increasing. Without being unduly op-
timistic we may at least predict that the available
cargo will again reach the prewar figures. In this
connection, for comparison, it may be of interest to
know that the largest amount of cargo ever carried
through the Suez Canal in any year was 20.27 1Tn'-
lion tons during the year 1912.
Traffic Handicapped by Ice
Owing to the frozen condition of the Lakes dur-
ing the winter they can only be navigated for a
period of about yYi months. In order to handle the
immense tonnage of ore, coal, and grain, which has
to be transported during this short season, it is nec-
essary to get a quick "turn around" of the vessels.
The stay in port for loading and unloading must be
reduced to a minimum. It was soon found that this
could only be accomplished by providing the docks
with loading and discharging appliances which were
specially constructed to suit each kind of cargo. In
contrast to ocean-going ships the vessels themselves
do not carry any machinery for handling of the
cargo.
It has generally been recognized that the engi-
neers have solved their problem of mechanical hand-
ling of the cargo in a most remarkable and econom-

ical way. It is a common occurrence that a vessel
is loaded in a couple of hours and unloaded in six
or eight hours. During the season of 1921 the aver-
age stay in lower Lake ports was 20 hours 54 min-
utes and in upper Lake ports 7 hours 31 minutes.
Last year a loading record was established by the
steamer D. G. Kerr into which was loaded a cargo
of 12,508 gross tons of ore in 16J/2 minutes. This
cargo was later unloaded in the record time of 3
hours 5 minutes.
Method of Loading Lake Vessels
Ore is loaded into a vessel from elevated bins
through spouts lowered over the hatches. These
spouts are spaced 12 feet apart. To accommodate
this spacing the hatches of the vessels are placed
either 12 or 24 feet apart, and the 12 foot spacing has
been adopted on practically all new vessels. The

HULETT UNLOADERS IN OPERATION
unloading of the ore is done either by grab buckets
dropped into the holds from overhead travelling
cranes or by machines of the Hulett type with rigid
arms. The average grab bucket takes about 10 tons
in one lift, but some of the latest Hulett unloaders
have a capacity of 17 tons.
Coal is usually loaded by a car dumper which
picks up the railroad car and capsizes it into a shoot
over the hatch. The coal unloaders are constructed
similar to the ore unloaders.
Grain is handled by elevators on the dock both
in loading and discharging.
The nature of the loading and unloading machin-
ery has had the greatest influence on the structural
design of the ships. The vessels must be so con-
structed that this machinery can be operated effi-
ciently. I quote the following from a paper by Pro-
fessor Sadler: "These methods of loading and un-
loading have determined four principal features in
the design of the vessels.
Influence of Loading Devices on Ship Design
First, it is absolutely necessary to have the decks
of the vessel clear from any encumbrances, such as
houses, casings, etc., in order that the cargo opera-
tions may proceed with dispatch. This has led to
the placing of the machinery as far aft, and the
navigation part of the vessel, pilot house, etc., as far
forward, as possible.
Second, the hatches must be placed to suit the
spacing of the chutes at the loading docks, and must
be as numerous as possible, to minimize the moving
of the vessel or the unloading machines.
Third, the depth of the vessel is governed some-
what by the height of the chutes, which must be
at such an angle that the ore will flow from the
bins.
Fourth, the holds of the vessels should be as free
as possible from any obstructions which would
hamper the operations of the unloading machines."
The increase in size of the Lake freighter has
been most remarkable. In 1886 the largest ship was
303' long; in 1898 two vessels were built which
were 455' long with 50' beam and a depth of 29'.
The largest vessels now on the Lakes are W. Grant
Morden, 625' over all length, 59' beam and 32' depth
with a deadweight capacity of 14,200 gross tons;
and the steamers Col. J. M. Schoonmaker and Wm.
P. Schneider, Jr., 617' over all, 64' beam and 33'
depth, deadweight capacity 14,000 gross tons. The
majority of the newer ships have the following di-
mensions: Length on keel 580', breadth moulded
60', and 32' depth, deadweight capacity about 12.100
gross tons at a draft of 20'. While the length of
the vessels has been gradually increased, the beam
and the moulded depth have not been increased in
the same proportions. The Lake freighter has
therefore proportions which, according to our
friends on salt water, have nothing left of the in-
trinsic, natural beauty of a ship. They are right;
but, unfortunately, the naval architect had to de-
sign a ship to suit the special conditions of the trade
and that could not be done by following the ortho-
dox salt water practice.
The beam has to a certain extent been limited
by considerations of locks, narrow channels, etc.,
and by the reach of the unloading machinery. The
draft is limited by the depth of water at the locks
at Sault Sainte Marie and the depth at the Lime
Kiln Crossing near Detroit, where at present the
available draft is about 20 feet. The increase in
capacity has been possible only by increasing the
length and by filling out the form as much as possi-
ble. On almost all the freighters the block-coeffi-
cient is .87 to .88, which, probably, is the limit from
consideration of economical propulsion.
The depth of the vessels has been governed main-


Page 7
MICHIGAN
T E C H N I C

ly by the height of the ore docks. In order to get
sufficient slope on the ore spouts the vessel must
not be too high out of the water when light. For
ships of about 600 feet length the depth is usually
32 feet. This is a ratio of length to depth of nearly
19, whereas on ocean-going ships this ratio is, as a
rule, between 12 and 13. The frontis shows the pro-
file of a typical Lake freighter. If we compare this
view with that of an ocean-going vessel, we have
to admit that, so far as beauty goes, the comparison
is not in the favor of the Lake freighter.
Development of Lake Vessels
The earlier type was similar to ocean-going ves-
sels of the so-called deep frame system, which were
specially suited to carry coal and other bulk car-
goes. These Lake freighters were single deck ships
with web frames, a tier of strongbeams in the hold,
and stanchions between the hatches which were
spaced 24 feet apart. The tanktop was flush plated
and raised to a height of about 5 feet in order to
provide enough water ballast capacity.
When the size of the unloading machinery grew,
this type was no longer satisfactory because stanch-
ions, holdbeams, and web frames were in the way
for the heavy unloading grabs and were often dam-
aged by them. To get the hold clear of obstruc-
tions the beams and the stanchions were dispensed
with and a heavy "arch beam" was constructed be-
tween the hatches.

(Fig. 4) Cross-Section Showing Hold Construction
As the vessels often have to go up the Lakes in
ballast it was found best to increase the water bal-
last capacity. This led to the construction of side
tanks which also have the advantage that they en-
close the framing. With this construction we have
then been able to get a cargo hold which is entirely
free from stanchions, beams, stringers, brackets, or
any other obstructions so that the unloaders can
work to their highest capacity without doing any
damage to the vessel. Fig. 3 shows a section of a
modern type of Lake freighter.
In nearly all the vessels the sidetanks extend to
a stringer about 11 feet below the deck and are con-
structed as in Fig. 3, but in some vessels they are
made wider and with sloping sides as in Figs. 4

(Fig. 3) Interior of Lake Freighter
and 5. This latter construction provides more bal-
last capacity, but it reduces the cubic capacity for
loading of grain and the sloping sides are liable to
be damaged by the unloading grabs.
There are a few vessels in which the sidetank
plating extends from the bottom plating up to the
deck. Without adding any considerable amount of
steel weight this arrangement connects the deck-
stringers better with the other parts of the struc-
ure and provides a more rigid construction. It also
raises the center of gravity of the water ballast
which reduces the Metacentric Height and helps to
make the vessel less "stiff" and more comfortable
when going in ballast. The Metacentric Height is
rather excessive in the present bulk freighters.
Fig. 4 shows the main scantlings of a modern
freighter. The frames are generally spaced 3 feet
apart with webframes every 12 feet. A few ships
have been built on the Isherwood system. This
construction has not been entirely satisfactory for
service on the Lakes because the transverse strength
was not sufficient, partly on account of the great
local stresses which these vessels are subjected to
when taken through the locks and handled at the
locks without help of tugs.
Some of the newest vessels have transverse side
framing and longitudinal channels in the bottom
and the decks, and this seems to be a good combina-
tion providing both sufficient transverse and longi-
tudinal strength.

Environment Permits Use of Lighter Vessels
Several times men connected with salt water
ships have expressed a doubt that the Lake freight-
ers are seaworthy and strong enough. In strength
calculations it is common to assume the ship to rest
on a wave of the same length as the ship and a
height of one-twentieth of the length. The larger
vessels on the Lakes will never meet waves ap-
proaching the length of the vessel. Calculations
also show that the Lake freighters are only sub-
jected to about one-third as large bending moments
as ocean-going vessels of the same lengths. Some
of their scantlings have therefore been lighter than
ocean-going vessels; this, however, does not mean
that they are weak. In a recent investigation car-

r*,3$_
(Fic. 5) SECTION SHOWING BALLAST TANK CONSTRUCTION
ried out for the U. S. Government Committee on
Freeboard and Bulkheads it has been conclusively
shown that these vessels possess sufficient strength
for their service; and, as a matter of fact, the stress-
es on these vessels are less than those which exist
in ocean-going vessels.
During the development of the bulk freighter
there have not been many changes in the machinery.
Owing to the shortness of the season it has been
of the greatest importance to obtain a simple and
reliable engine. The shipowners have not been will-
ing to experiment with steam turbines, Diesel en-
gines, or other types of drive even though these
may prove more economical from the viewpoint of
fuel consumption. The engine is usually of the
triple-expansion, three-cylinder type; in some cases,
however, the quadruple engine has been installed.
The boilers are nearly always of the Scotch type
with some system of forced draft and do not differ
much in design from ordinary single ended Scotch
boilers adopted for salt water ships.
The larger freighters are usually fitted with ma-
chinery developing from 1800 to 2000 I.H.P., which
permits them to maintain a speed of about 10 knots
in average weather, and that appears to be the most
economical speed for this service.
Interest Shown in New Waterway
Of late, a very lively interest has been shown in
the plans of connecting the Great Lakes with the
Atlantic coast by a canal deep enough to permit
ocean-going vessels of moderate size to travel up
to the ports on the Lakes. At present, only smaller
ships of about 260 feet length and a draft of 14 feet
are able to go through the locks in the Welland
Canal. The plans are now before Congress in form
of a bill, and it looks as if its adoption is merely a
matter of time. We may then look forward to a
new era in the development of water transportation
in the Great Lakes district. There is no doubt that
the great industrial centers and the rich farming
districts around the Lakes will benefit enormously
by being linked up by direct water transportation
with the coastlines of the United States and with
foreign ports. Such an all-water route will greatly
reduce the transportation cost; largely, because it
will save one loading and unloading at railroad
terminals.
Ocean-going vessels will not be able to compete
successfully with Lake freighters in transporting
iron ore and coal, because their construction is not
suited for the methods of loading and unloading
used on the Lakes. A large amount of the grain
and general cargo will, however, be carried by
ocean-going ships.
It is very likely that new types of ships will be
designed specially to meet such new requirements
as this route will demand.
Along with the deep-water canal to the coast the
depth will have to be increased in the present chan-
nels and rivers connecting the Lakes. Then the
naval architects may have to design Lake freighters
with greater moulded depth which will be able to
take full advantage of the .deeper draft so that even
in the future the Bulk Freighter of the Great Lakes
will be the most efficient carrier of bulk cargo in
the world.
Electric Welding
A new semi-automatic arc welding lead, when
used in conjunction with an automatic arc welding
head, retains the continuous feed features of the
automatic apparatus, yet allows the operator to di-
rect the arc as required by the conditions of the
work thereby extending the benefits of the auto-
matic electrode feed to work of unsymmetrical
shape.

Proposed Plan will Make It Possible for Everybody, Who so Desires,
to Hear Charles Evans Hughes Address the Senior Class at the
Commencement Exercises this Year
Due to the ever increasing size of the graduating
classes from year to year, the capacity of Hill Audi-
torium has been taxed to its limit to provide seats
for the graduating class, parents, and visiting alum-
ni. There are thousands in addition who would like
to attend, but cannot do so because of the lack of
available seating capacity. This problem is one
which vve cannot consider lightly. It is only
But how can all this be accomplished? Where is
there an auditorium seating any such a number in
Ann Arbor or in the neighboring cities? Where is
there a speaker who can make himself heard to such
a great multitude? When we consider how Demos-
thenes labored to make himself a tolerable speaker
to an audience of 5,000, the problem seems beyond
solution.

fair to our parents, who have sacrificed pleasures
for themselves in order that we might attend the
University, that they should be able to witness our
graduation. Besides there are other relatives, inter-
ested townspeople, and friends desirous of attend-
ing. Thousands of Alumni would return to their
Alma Mater for the day if it were possible for them
to be present at Commencement. A conservative
estimate would place the number who would attend
at from 20,000 to 30,000 people.
The Proposed Plan
However, the solution of this problem is within
our grasp. Modern telephonic development has
solved the problem for us. Amplifiers and loud-
speaking telephones are not untried experiments for
they have proved themselves great successes. By
their use it is possible for a speaker, talking in an
ordinary tone of voice, to be heard by everyone
within a large radius as distinctly as if within a
few feet of the speaker.

The capacity of Hill Auditorium prohibits its use
for such audiences. It will accommodate but 20
per cent of the probable number of people. The
only place where sufficient seating capacity can be
obtained is the football stadium on Ferry Field.
This will seem to some to be a new and novel use
of the stands but it is the only solution to the prob-
lem. The opportunity to see the ceremonies is bet-
ter on Ferry Field than in Hill Auditorium. There
program at Arlington on the occasion of the burial
of the unknown soldier.
The Apparatus Required
The apparatus required for installation such as
would be used on Ferry Field would be considera-
bly simpler than that which was used at Washing-
ton at the time of President Harding's inauguration
or that used at Arlington on Armistice Day. The

Loud Speaking Receivers Used at Arlington Cemetery
would be no difficulty in hearing every word which
is spoken if the proper amplifiers were installed.
It would be necessary to erect a small speaker's
platform on the eastern end of the field. The grad-
uating class might be seated on the field itself or in
some particular part of the stands. Sections of the
south stand may be reserved for the faculty. The
remaining seats in the south stand and the capacity
of both the north and west stands would be used for
invited guests.
Commencement held in the manner thus outlined
could be as dignified as a commencement held in
Hill Auditorium. Considerable effort should be ex-
ercised in the publicity given the occasion and also
in the method of handling the people in order that
the proper dignity be instilled into everyone. The
fears of anyone who believes that the occasion could
not be as dignified if held in the open may be put
to rest by reading an account of the Armistice Day
apparatus in the latter case was considerably more
complicated because, not only was it necessary to
provide current strong enough for the loud speak-
ers, but also sufficiently powerful to send the mes-
sage to New York and San Francisco, where it was
heard by other large audiences.
There are three essential parts to the equipment,
a transmitter, an amplifier, and loud-speaking re-
ceivers. The transmitter is in purpose and con-
struction much like an ordinary telephone trans-
mitter, except that it would be more sensitive. It
is placed a few feet in front of the speaker in such
a manner that it will not interfere with his speak-
ing or obstruct the vision of the audience. It is so
much out of the way that few notice its presence.
The amplifier is the brains of the apparatus. It
is very similar in theory to the amplifiers used on
wireless equipment. In fact, one concern makes an
amplifier which is suitable for both uses. The ac-

companying diagram showing the area covered by
the vast crowd which assembled at the Inaugura-
tion of Harding gives some idea of the actual re-
sults obtained. Those standing three blocks away
heard every word.
The receivers which would be used in this case
at Ferry Field are elongated wooden horns con-
taining the necessary diaphragms and electrical de-
vices. These horns are arranged in a group or in a
cluster near the speaker. Experience has proved
that this arrangement is better than the use of sev-
eral isolated receivers as the voice in this case seems
to come directly from the speaker.
There is also a more simple amplifying set man-
ufactured of which only the transmitter must be on
the speaker's platform. By means of this apparatus,
with its full power, and under favorable conditions,
the human voice has been carried seven miles. This
seems almost incredible at first; nevertheless, it is
a reality. This equipment has been used at football
games at the University of California with great
success.
Loud-Speaking Equipment Reproduces Speech
Perfectly
It should be remembered that although these in-
struments have great power they can be adjusted
to meet the exact requirements needed. Even when
a person is very close to the receiver the volume of
sound is not so great as to be offensive.
The Scientific American for February, 1922, com-
ments on their use as follows:
"Loud-speaking equipment, to be suitable for im-
portant public gatherings, must reproduce speech
which is natural and lifelike in all respects. By far
the most difficult problems which had to be solved
in developing the present loud-speaker equipment
were those involving the transmission and repro-
duction of speech with perfect fidelity, so that all
the characteristic inflections and modulations of a
speaker's voice, slight though these might be, would
be accurately preserved. These problems proved
much more difficult to solve than that simply of
producing large amplification of the voice. They
have, however, been met successfully and the pres-

ent loud-speaker system is eminently satisfactory
both as regards volume and articulation, and so
marks a distinct advance in the art of speech trans-
mission. So natural are the sounds of the voice as
they come from the loud-speaker, and so very slight
is the transition from within earshot of the speaker
to the region where only the projectors are heard,
that if a person who is standing beside the speaker
should walk away, keeping his back turned toward
the latter, he could go off 200 feet, or even more,
and still have a very distinct impression that the
speaker was just behind him."
At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology a
series of loud-speaking receivers are placed in vari-
ous corridors of the Auditorium building to convey
the addresses to the people who were unable to get
into the auditorium itself at commencement. Con-
siderable success has been attained with this equip-
ment, and its use approved.
Conditions Made Better in Spite of Inclement
Weather
The records of the United States Weather Bu-
reau for the last 51 years show that on 38.4% of the
days during the week of June 19-24 there was ap-
preciable rain. However, the commencement exer-
cises would require only three hours of good weath-
er and' hence the chances of appreciable rain would
be less than five in a hundred. This is almost a
condition of affairs not worth considering.
But suppose it did rain and Ferry Field could
not be used? The conditions would then still, un-
der this proposed plan, be better than at present.
It would be possible to have tickets to certain sec-
tions of the stands corresponding to certain sections
in Hill Auditorium. The amplification apparatus
could be removed from its place in the football sta-
dium and installed in University Hall, Natural Sci-
ence Auditorium, and other auditoriums around the
campus to take care of overflow meetings. Weath-
er forecasts would give ample time to make this
change if the necessary wires were placed the day
before.
Whatever the outcome, those who came on that
day to attend the commencement exercises would
not go away with an ill-feeling toward the Univer-
sity, because they would see that the authorities
had made every possible effort to enable them to
hear the addresses.
This solution is proposed in order that it might
be seen that as many as want to attend the com-
mencement' exercises may do so. It is the only so-
lution by which so many people can see and at the
same time hear the speaker. We owe it to our par-
ents, relatives, alumni and friends to provide facili-
ties for being present on this occasion, for seeing
the speaker and for hearing what he has to say.

Introductory
Before launching into a. description of the Filtra-
tion Works now under construction for the City of
Detroit, it would seem desirable, as a prelude there-
to, to touch casually on the history and develop-
ment of filtration in its application to public water
supplies and to describe the common types of filters
used for this purpose.
Historical
Ignoring all allusion to the more or less vague
accounts of the application of certain coagulants
for clarifying water supplies in the early centuries,
and confining the question at issue to the later field
of definitely established facts, it may be asserted
that the earliest authentic record of filtration as ap-
plied to public water supplies was in 1829, when the
Chelsea Water Company of East Chelsea, London,
England, constructed and placed in operation a slow
sand filter for the treatment of its water supply.
Twenty years later—1849—England suffered from
a severe cholera epidemic and the theory was then
first advanced that cholera and analogous ailments
were water borne diseases, and the epidemic traced
directly to polluted waters. Due to recognition of
the soundness of this theory, the London Metro-
politan District was compelled, by an act of Parlia-
ment, to filter its entire water supply, thereby
stamping filtration with official governmental ap-
proval.,
The adoption of filtration as the most effective
means of safe-guarding the urban public against
water borne diseases was very gradual, many scien-
tists as well as laymen remaining skeptical regard-
ing its merits, but the cholera epidemic of Ham-
burg, Germany, in 1892 gave such convincing proof
of its efficiency that further controversion was fu-
tile. During that year Hamburg, one of the few
German cities having unfiltered water, lost over
8,600 persons by death from cholera, while Altona
and Wandsbeck, separated from Hamburg only by
imaginary boundaries, but having filtered water
supplies, remained comparatively free from the dis-
ease. Along one street which forms the boundary
between Hamburg and Altona, cholera was ram-
pant on the Hamburg side, whereas the Altona side
was free from it, and the only difference was that
Altona had a filtered water supply and Hamburg
did not. Many later instances, and much data col-
lected both in Europe and in this country, confirm-
ed the evidence furnished by the Hamburg case,
but none was more convincing.
Filtration in the United States
The development of filtration in the United States
was even less rapid than in Europe: The earliest
serious efforts towards investigation, with a view to
its adoption in this country, was made in 1866 when
Mr. James C. Kirkwood was commissioned by the
City of St. Louis to make a study of European fil-
ters, and report on the feasibility of its application
for treatment of the Mississippi River water. This
exhaustive report, published in 1869, was the first
important treatise on the subject issued in the Uni-
ted States, and it may be of interest to note,—as
indicative of conservative municipal procrastination,
—that fifty years elapsed after the publication of
Kirkwood's report before St. Louis installed a fil-
tration plant, although for several years its water
supply was greatly improved by coagulation and
sedimentation.
The first municipal filter in the United States was
constructed for Poughkeepsie, N. Y., in 1874 to
treat water taken from the Hudson River. This
was an uncovered slow sand filter of crude construc-
tion, its capacity being from two to three million
gallons daily.
During the decade following a limited number of
small filters were installed in different sections of
the country, and this period gave birth to the so-
called mechanical filter,—a product of American in-
ventive genius,—involving the use of coagulants,
convenient cleaning methods, and mechanical agi-
tators. In 1892 the publication of the report of the
Massachusetts State Board of Health describing the
exhaustive experiments on filtration made at the
experimental station at Lawrence, Mass., gave a
needed impetus to the subject, making the art of
filtration a real and recognized issue in this country,
and founded the inception of a period of rapid and
progressive increase in the number of communities
furnished with filtered water. In 1890 there were

but 300,000 people in the United States supplied
with filtered water, while at present more than
twenty million inhabitants of our towns and cities
are enjoying the benefits of filtered water supplies,
and as a logical sequence, the typhoid death rate per
hundred thousand of urban population has decreas-
ed from 48 in 1890 to 13 in 1917.
Types of Filters
Eliminating occasional eccentric or freakish types,
filters may be divided into two classes,—Slow Sand
and Mechanical or Rapid Sand Filters. Both class-
es use sand as a filtering medium, with a sub-stra-
tum of coarser material for drainage purposes, and
a system of collector drains or pipes at the bottom
of the coarse gravel for conveying the filtered efflu-
ent to the filtered water reservoir, the water being
filtered in its passage downward through the sand.
The slow sand type, as the name implies, is oper-
ated at a very slow rate, averaging less than four
million gallons per acre per day, the raw water be-
ing conveyed to the sand beds without any previous
treatment except such as may be afforded by plain
subsidence where storage reservoirs are available,
and consequently the rate of flow of the water
through the sand must be greatly retarded or fine
particles of mud or other matter held in suspension,
including bacteria, will penetrate the sand bed and
a certain portion will pass through. The rapid
sand filters are operated at rates of from one hun-
dred million to one hundred and twenty-five million
gallons per acre per day, and'experiments recently
conducted in Detroit have shown that rates up to
one hundred and eighty million gallons may be em-
ployed without impairing efficiency. One of the
typifying characteristics of the rapid sand filter is
the preparatory treatment of the water before it
reaches the sand beds. This consists of the use of
a coagulating medium,—usually aluminum sulphate
or sulphate of iron,—injected before the water
reaches the mixing chamber,—when it is decom-
posed by combination with the alkaline constitu-
ents usually present in the water (or artificially
supplied when lacking) forming a gelatinous pre-
cipitate known as aluminum hydrate or hydroxide
of iron, according to the coagulant employed, which
has a tendency to unite the minute particles of sus-
pended matter into visible masses and coincident-
ally enmeshing the bacteria. The water then passes
through a coagulation basin at low velocity where
the greater portion of the coagulated sediment (50
to1 75 per cent) is precipitated. The residue depos-
ited on the surface of the sand bed immediately
forms a coagulum scum which, acting as a porous
screen, impedes the passage of suspended matter
and the enmeshed bacteria,—the immediate forma-
tion of this coagulum surface preventing the pass-
age of all matter held in suspension, even at the
rapid filtering rate.
The other important difference between the two
types is the method of washing: All filter beds be-
come clogged on the sand surface after passing a
given quantity of water, this quantity being gov-
erned principally by the turbidity of the raw water.
Normally a filter will pass from fifty million to
three hundred million gallons per acre of sand be-
fore the clogging creates a prohibitive loss of head,
and then the beds must be cleaned. Slow sand fil-
ters are cleaned by scraping off a thin upper layer
of sand which has become impregnated with an ac-
cumulation of mud, the work being done with shov-
els or spades by manual labor—a crude and tedious
operation. Rapid sand filters are washed by re-
versing the flow of filtered water, which, bubbling
up from the bottom, holds the sand practically in
suspension, washing off the adhering coagulum and
mud which overflows into the wash water troughs
and is conveyed thence to the sewer. The actual
washing of a rapid sand filter bed occupies about
four minutes.
Plans for the Detroit Filter
A general plan for the proposed filtration plant
for Detroit was prepared by the writer in 1916-17,
founded on a careful study of existing works in
their relation to the proposed plant. In 1919 these
plans were reviewed and compared with other sug-
gested schemes, and after careful consideration the
original plans were adhered to in practically every
detail except where equipment previously ordered
necessitated a change.
The Detroit filter will have the largest capacity
of any filtration plant in the rcorld. The plans in
their entirety contemplate a plant having a daily
filtrating capacity of from 320 million to 360 mil-
lion gallons per day, with provisions for meeting
peak loads of short duration up to a 400 million gal-
lon rate. The general design of the new filtration
plant is divided into three separate structures:
first, the Low Lift pumping Station; second, the
Coagulation Basin, Filter Beds and Wash Water
Tanks all combined under one roof, and third, the
Filtered Water Reservoir.
Low Lift Pumping Station
The Low Lift Pumping Station, 65 feet wide by
175 feet long, is located immediately in line with
the ten foot and six foot diameter conduits which
were torn out for the full length of the station. The
water flows from these conduits into a screen cham-
ber at the southerly end of the station where elec-
trically operating revolving screens intercept all
coarse floating material and ice forhiation, provi-

sion being made for cleaning the screens while in
operation. The screening element is composed of
copper wire 14 B.W. gauge, three meshes to the
inch, providing clear openings about one-quarter
inch square. From the screen chamber the water
flows into the suction well 26 feet wide by 1 1 feet
deep directly under the floor of the pumping station.
The engine floor which was placed low to pro-
vide short suction connections to the pumps, is
twenty feet below ground level, a broad balcony
extending around the interior of the station at en-
trance level. The pumping equipment consists of
four 700 II.P. and one 400 H.P. motor operated
ing are the eighty filter beds occupying a space 480
feet by 270 feet and south of these the coagulation
basins, with the mixing chamber and chemical feed
and storage space between.
The mixing chamber is considerably smaller in
proportion to the capacity of the plant than those
which have been provided in most recent filter in-
stallations ,but is designed to provide thorough and
rapid mixing at high velocities. Alternate sets of
vertical and horizontal baffles are placed through-
out the full length of the channel, and as the coag-
ulant solution is introduced where the water flows
in from the Low Lift Station, there will be ample

GENERAL PLAN OF NEW PLANT
centrifugal pumps with a combined capacity of 465
million gallons daily, designed to deliver water to
the mixing chamber of the coagulation basin against
a head of thirty feet.
Filters
The Filtration Works proper are all under one
roof in a structure 480 feet wide by 810 feet long,
with a three-story building at the center of the
north end which forms the main entrance to the
filters, and constitutes the tower for the wash water
tanks, providing also space for laboratory and of-
fices. Each of the two tanks has a capacity of
75,000 gallons, a quantity sufficient to wash one
filter bed. Immediately south of the entrance build-
opportunity for a perfect admixture by the time the
coagulation basins are reached. Chemical bins and
mixing apparatus and chemical storage space are
provided above the mixing chamber, dry feed chem-
ical mixers being used instead of large solution
tanks.
The two Coagulation Basins cover a space 480
feet wide by 525 feet long, and have a total capacity
of 30 million gallons, providing a subsidence period
of over two hours when the whole filter is operated
at its maximum rate. Each basin is divided for the
greater portion of its length by a baffle wall, so
that the coauglated water flows at a low velocity a
distance equal to twice the length of the basin. The
bottoms are sloped to low points where mud valves

permit flushing the accumulated sediment into the
sewer.
On account of prevailing low winter temperature,
the coagulation basins will be covered, — a steel
trussed roof type of construction being adopted as
affording a better opportunity for observation of
coagulating effects, and also permitting a more
pleasing architectural treatment at no additional
cost. This arrangement makes the external eleva-
tion of both filters and coagulation basins practic-
ally the same.
Between the coagulation basin and the filter beds
a conduit extends for the full width of the structure,
from which the coagulated water flows into each of
the conduits feeding a double tier of eight filter
beds.
The filter consists of eighty beds, divided into five
double rows of eight beds with a pipe gallery be-
tween each double row, the operating floor form-
ing the cover for the pipe galleries. Each bed has
an effective sand area of 1,088 sq. ft. or one-fortieth
of an acre, and has a filtering capacity of four mil-
lion gallons daily at 160 million gallon rate, or four
and one-half million gallons at 180 million gallon
rate. The filter is covered with a steel trussed roof,
with continuous raised monitors over operating
galleries, affording provision for ample light and
ventilation.
Arrangements for sterilization through the me-
dium of liquid chlorine are provided in a space over
one of the filter beds on the westerly side where,
if found necessary, chlorine can be introduced at
the end of the main filtered water collector before
it enters the filtered water reservoir.
All water conduits up to the point where the
water is delivered to the filter beds through 24-inch
gate valves are of concrete, and in the design of
these the effort has been to convey the coagulated
water to the beds with the least disturbance possi-
ble, to prevent the breaking up of the 'floe.' All
conduits for the collection of filtered water and its
conveyance to the filtered water reservoir also are
of concrete.
The wash water troughs are cast iron, extending
from the rear end of the filter bed to the wash
water channel at the front or gallery end of the
beds, and supported at the center from concrete T
beams, which form walks across the middle of the
beds.
The strainer system which collects the filtrate
after it has passed through the sand bed, and also
serves as a multiple distributing nozzle for the wash
water during washing periods, is composed of a
manifold system of cast iron pipe, branching from
two main cast iron collectors built partially into the
concrete bottom, the smallest branches being two
inches in diameter and the larger or main branches
seven inches in diameter. These pipes are tapped
along the upper surface and brass strainer cups
screwed in at intervals of about six inches over the
entire bottom.
The filtrate from each bed will flow from the two
main collectors into a connecting pipe which in turn
connects with a Venturi type rate controller, the
water passing through it into the filtrated water
conduit under the pipe gallery floor and on through
the main filtered water collector, into the Filtered
Water Reservoir. The rate controller is the govern-
ing factor in filtration, as it regulates automatically
the quantity of water passing through the filter in
accordance, with any given rate at which it may be
set, and indicates and records the quantity of water
filtered.
The filtering medium consists of a level bed of
sand 26 inches deep, overlying a bed of gravel 14
inches deep, graduated from i^-inch size at the
bottom to i/ioth inch size at the top. The sand
will be relatively coarse, the grains varying from
0.40 to 0.90 millimeters, having a uniformity co-effi-
cient of 1.6 to 1.7.
Each filter bed has separate control, manipulated
from an operating table placed opposite the center
of the.bed, upon which are placed the indicating
and recording gauges, and the keys which operate
the four controlling hydraulic gate valves. All
valves on the filters, and in the coagulation basins
are hydraulically operated.
Filtered Water Reservoir
The Filtered Water Reservoir will be an all con-
crete structure 360 feet wide by 810 feet long, with
flat slab reinforced concrete floor and roof, the lat-
ter supported on concrete columns. The roof will
be covered with earth and sodded to form an addi-
tion to the park area, to be utilized either for tennis
courts or other recreational purposes. The reser-
voir when full will contain approximately forty
million gallons, and will serve to balance the fluct-
uating conditions of consumption without disturb-
ing the rate of filtration.
General Construction
The sub-structure of the Low Lift Pumping Sta-
tion, all of the filtration structures up to the water
level in the coagulation basins and filter beds, all
conduits, the two wash water tanks and the chem-
ical bins were constructed of reinforced concrete.
The superstructures of the chemical and wash
water buildings, with the exception of the curtain
walls, are reinforced concrete also. The superstruc-
tures of the pumping station and of all sections of
the filtration plant are brick, with gray pressed
brick and stone trim for exterior walls, including

the veneering of all exposed exterior concrete walls.
The general character of the bottom of coagula-
tion basins and filter beds is beam and slab con-
struction, the beams as well as wall footings bear-
ing directly on concrete piles. The base area of the
whole plant is built directly on the ground, with
the pipe heads projecting from six to twelve inches
above the excavated level of the ground surface, but
no dependence was placed on the bearing value of
the soil, as the entire weight of structures and con-
tents were calculated to be carried by the piling.
Construction Methods and Progress
Preparatory to the work of constructing the fil-
ter plant, borings were made over the proposed site,
and a number of test piles driven, and the data de-
rived therefrom proved conclusively that piling
would be required under all portions of the struc-
ture. As the greater portion of the filter founda-
tion is above low river level, concrete piles were
.determined on and after competitive bidding, the
"Raymond" pile was selected, a type in which a
corrugated reinforced tapering steel shell is driven
with a steel core or mandril, and after the core is
withdrawn the shell is filled with concrete. Owing
to the fact that sub-soil conditions varied greatly,
and that the limit of length of the "Raymond" pile
was about thirty-eight feet, composite piles were
used where the thirty-eight feet piles did not pro-
vide ample bearing value. These consisted of wood-
en piles of varying lengths, which were driven first
and followed by a concrete pile twelve to fifteen feet
long, the wooden section being doweled into the
concrete portion. The result was a pile having a
total length of from sixty to seventy feet, with the
wooden portion well below the water line.
The pile foundation work was completed early in
1921, and the concrete structure of the filtration
works started immediately thereafter. The first
concrete was poured on June 3, and the work com-
pleted November 15, 1921. This contract compris-
ed 10,000 cubic yards of excavation; 50,000 cubic
yards of concrete; 2,200 tons of reinforcing steel;
96 tons of structural steel, and the placing of 770
tons of cast iron specials.
Contractor's Plant
The equipment of the Contractor consisted of
two concrete mixers; one locomotive crane; an in-
dustrial railway with gasoline locomotives and cars;
four five-yard buckets and two cable-ways. The
concrete mixing plant was located at the south end
of the grounds, near the canal, all gravel and ce-
ment having been delivered by barges. The gravel
which was stored on the ground was handled by
the locomotive crane, and dumped into an elevated
bin, from which it was chuted by gravity into the
charging hoppers of two one-yard concrete mixers.
The cement was raised to the mixing floor by a
construction elevator. The concrete mixers, which
were set about twenty feet above the ground, deliv-
ered the mixed concrete into a five-yard hopper
which in turn dumped it into the five-yard buckets
carried on the small flat cars.
The loaded buckets were immediately conveyed

May I call your attention to three classes or races a full grown Mexican drove a pair of mules to a
of common labor,—following the order, mainly, in scraper on our heavy cuts and fills four days out of
which I met them on public work as an engineer,
viz.—the Spanish American, the American Negro
and the American Casual Worker.
The Spanish American is an Inferior Laborer
The Spanish American was used by us in grad-
ing the Texas and Pacific Ry. east from El Paso in
the early '8o's. Our line followed the Rio Grande
River for the first sixty miles. Our common labor
was very largely Mexican. By Spanish American
we mean anyone on this continent, native to lands
south of the Rio Grande River. In some cases,
notably in Brazil, he is not of Spanish but of Portu-
gese extraction. Nevertheless the term is so ap-
plied. Why are Spanish Americans backward races?
A prominent business man of Buenos Aires and a
native there recently asked one of our consuls,—
"Why is my country two hundred years behind
your country, the United States, in its civilization?"
And then he answered his own question by saying,
"My ancestors came to the new country for
gold while yours came for God." The Saxons came
from the north of Europe for religious freedom,
bringing with them their families. They did not
each week, that was all that we could wisely ex-
pect. A Mexican is a man partly grown,—in size,
strength, courage and character. He is a fairly de-
cent fellow. They stab each other,—but seldom
stab you. lie is docile—not a striker. He is proud.
He will, stay on the job and work part of the time.
When Villa was abroad, the Mexicans came to
us for work. When the world war was on we were
glad to induce them to come. Our great railroads
leading north from the Mexican border have, now
for some years, used many of them as track labor-
ers. They are scattering and may be seen on our
streets,—we think them Indians or Mulattoes. They
are not usually as strong as Italians but compare
favorably with them in many ways. They live
much like Indians. We must study them and use
them whether it suits us to do so or not. They are
Catholic in religion but the men arc not pious.
The women arc not house servants for their moth-
ers were Indians. The men are not very mechanical.
Our Negro Labor Problem
The second race 1 would speak of as common
labor is the American Negro. By that I mean men

having any African blood and now living in the Uni-
ted States. I am not discussing slavery. We
brought these black people here at the first and to
all parts of our country. As natives we are re-
sponsible for them and to them,—these children of
misfortune. Send them back? Do they have to go?
Where back in Africa could these born here, wonted
to American life, possibly live? Think it over.
What are we going to do? In my judgment we are
going to have them remain here as a separate race
in our midst. Then we are going to use them for
the mutual good.
If you consider a Negro as a grown up child,—a
child mentally and a man physically you have, I
think, started right. And, every drop of white
blood in that Negro's veins is an added misfortune
to him and to the country in which he lives. That
white blood is of the poorest. Again, as in the
Mexican the hybrid is the inferior. The blacker the
negro is the more trusty and the better his real
character. In his case intelligence and reliability
do not follow as cause and effect.
The Negro is good sized and strong. The Negro
eats well, sleeps well, clothes comfortably and is
good natured. Despite his reputation in some direc-
tions, he is honest, decent, religious and very loyal.
The black man and, the black woman in the South-
ern States during our Civil War acted nobly in the
unprotected homes of the South. As a laborer he
must be cared for. He can not take his pay and
care for himself. We must board and lodge him.
He is a big child. When sick he will die unless we
see that he is doctored. He has little initiative and
lacks resolution. His courage is not wide. He is
not provident. He gets despondent, and craves
music and entertainment. His foreman must speak
English without any foreign accent. You must let
him sing as he works if he so desires. Do not try
to make him over into a white laborer. He is not
a white man with a black skin. The American Ne-
gro is, in my judgment a more hopeful working
unit than the south European.
Our American Casual Worker
The third we will consider is that white Ameri-
can, the Casual Worker, who applies to himself the
term of Hobo, a recent western United States term
of unknown origin. When I first met them and
the term, twenty-odd years ago, they called each
other "Bos." Our frontier railroads were largely
built by them. Our seasonal work is now done by
them. Our industrial work can not be done without
them. Who are they?
The winter weather came very early a certain
year in Minnesota. They had followed the har-
vest into Canada from Texas and did not start
south early enough. They were not dressed for
cold. Their funds ran low and they lacked food.
As we were feeding them at Winona, Minnesota, in
our homes, one public-spirited and studious lady
said to one of these men as he was eating food she
had placed before him in her kitchen:—"Why is it
that you, as well as others, are out of money, hun-
gry, and in this cold climate without an overcoat.
You are in your prime and intelligent. We want
to help all of you. What is the matter?" He said,
—"I'll tell you madam. I've been up against it and
I fell back. And that is all there is to it."
Maybe his wife had died, and he fled from old
scenes. Maybe his father had died and he felt
cheated in his share of that estate. Maybe his bus-
iness partner had cheated him out of his property.
Maybe drink had mastered him. An illness might
have discouraged him; hard times met him inoppor-
tunely or he may have been born with some mental
twist. Some get the idea that the world owes them
a living,—and are misanthropes. Whatever the
cause, — here they are and will be forever. Our
American misfits, — interesting always. Great in
pinches, — our very greatest, most human and
most exasperating. They are smart. At the mo-
ment, they are not lazy. Turbulent, irrepressible,
and care free, they are the bane of the life of young
foremen. Without them, life on public work would
have a dreary monotony.
They have great individuality, so help them find
their niche. Never have an iron clad pay roll. Start
them not too high but raise their pay if they stay
and are sober after their first pay day. Then raise
them again if that particular man is worth it. Have
that third rate of pay, extra high pay for the par-
ticular work in that section of the country. From
these you can make handy men, assistant foremen
and finally your foremen. My own experience has
been that one-third of such gangs will stay and get
the highest pay. This done; with the best third of
your men and your foremen you can do business
even if the rest strike. And the chances are, that
striking will not ensue.
The Engineer Must Respect His Labor
Allow me to call to the attention of you young
men, that I have not myself this morning called
Mexicans "Greasers," nor Negroes "Niggers," nor
Casual Workers of White Americans "Hoboes." Re-
spect your men if you expect them to respect you.
Whatever your politics, you have got to be a dem-
ocrat socially or you will have strikes. Men follow
you because they love you. If you do much in this
world handling men you must lead them. Driving
has played out and never was efficient. Be an engi-
neer of men as well as of materials and stresses.


By Professor F. N. Menefee
An Address to Engineering Students
One of the great troubles with which the young
man has to deal, is his consuming desire to accom-
plish a given task in a great hurry. I know this to
be a fact through my experience as a teacher, as
well as from personal experience. Once a resolve
to do a thing has gained possession of the young
man, he forthwith starts to take all the short cuts
and, if he finishes the task at all, the quality is often
impaired. The greater the task, the more often we
are apt to want immediate results and, by reason
of the short cut, the less satisfactory the result.
We can point to a number of old proverbs which
would prevent this if only adhered to: "A thing
worth doing at all is worth doing well," "Rome was
not built in a day, etc." But we are living in an
age of speed which fascinates the younger of us,
and we try the short cut first; then, if we are wise,
we go back and do it over again or, in some cases,
we give up and start something else. This process
goes on in the life of all individuals. Those who
keep trying finally learn their lesson, and first an-
alyze their problem as nearly as possible from start
to finish and then systematically conquer each part.
Those who do not learn the lesson are gradually
weeded out. They actually defeat themselves by
reason of lesser actually finished accomplishments.
If one studies the processes of life he will find that
there are always rules to follow if one is to win.
Rules Help Rather than Hinder the Contestant
In the games we play there are accepted written
rules. They do not necessarily limit one's individ-
uality; we do not complain of the rules, we set
about to learn them and to abide by them. Not to
do this, would not only spoil the game for others
but would give little satisfaction to the one who
would temporarily set them aside in his own favor.
Who among us would counsel setting aside the
rules of our games so that all might play as his per-
sonal inclinations indicated? Not one. We all
want rules for the other fellow and, to get them,
must accept them for ourselves. And so it is in
the serious game of life. We have had rules laid
down for us, and we finally come to see the wis-
dom of it. We can call these rules "laws" if we
wish and divide them into two general classes: laws
of nature and man-made laws. The former are im-
mutable; they are unchangeable; they were estab-
lished by the Creator; and all work in harmony.
The latter are imperfect; do not always fit together;
seldom dovetail perfectly and often overlap. But
they are rules; they are as good as humans, in the
main, want them, and are probably approaching the
more perfect rules of nature.
In each class of rules, or laws, we find some writ-
ten and some unwritten. As fast as man discovers
a law of nature he writes it down, he expresses it
in conventional terms that we understand, and it
finally becomes accepted. Some of these laws are,
for instance, the law of gravity, laws governing the
generation of steam, transmission of heat, laws of
chemistry, and so on. By learning these laws, or
rules, and by adhering to them, the engineer wins
his game; he achieves certain results; he takes the
water of a river and, abiding by the rules of grav-
ity, he can produce a predictable result in power.
The more rules he knows, the more combinations he
can play, the greater are his achievements.
Fundamentals Must Not Be Ignored
We have a tendency, however, to ignore some oi
the very simple fundamental laws; so simple that
from early childhood we have heard of them, but
which in the rush to do big things in a hurry, we
pass over as of not much consequence, and therein
we find the reason for a great many failures. There-
in we see ambition projecting the individual to
higher altitudes than his knowledge of, or adher-
ence to the rules or his ability will sustain him.
Not finding these rules in our text-books we may
be misled into thinking they do not apply to our
profession. Yet they are the rules that are common
to all professions, all business and all walks of life.
It is very interesting to watch a class of students
attack a problem in the classroom. It may involve
two or three of nature's laws which, by the man or
woman who has solved such problems several time?
and who has played the game before and is fa-
miliar with all the rules, can be written down all
at once and solved. But generally that is not the
way it is done.
Some of these students will read the problem over
20)

and over again as if to get a thorough understand-
ing of it, that is correct, but I have in mind now
the one who I think is trying to see it all at once
with the result that he is hazy on the whole thing.
Break It Up—Use One Part at a Time
I have struggled with this fellow and have wished
for a way to impress upon him the necessity of ap-
plying some of his fundamentals, one at a time. Af-
ter spending some time out of a classroom with such
a one, showing him how, after learning the first
principles of an idea in mechanics, each principle
became a tool and was to be used by him in prac-
tical application, and that, for instance, he could
take a bending moment diagram and separate it
into its positive and negative parts for ease in hand-
ling, he said, "I see; you break it up and use one
part at a time."
His expression was a happy one. It expressed
the idea exactly and in terms easily understood. It
forms the nucleus around which this discussion is
built. For when an engineer (or any one, for that
matter) learns to "break up" his problem into its
component parts he has learned one of the rules of
successful analysis. And if he can then put first
things first, and master them in order, he will suc-
ceed.
It isn't an academic rule; it applies every where
as we shall soon see. That student in the class who
"breaks it up" and puts down in proper order the
things to be done, has his problem half solved and
will in the long run win in that game which he is
playing, and will contract a habit which he will
carry with him through life.
Have you ever sat in a grandstand and watched
a football game where the opposing team has a hab-
it of concentrating a large and complicated mass
of players in some play which is making consistent
gains for them? Your team can't change the rules,
you don't want them changed, you want them to
solve the problem and win according to the set rule.
You don't want them to fuss around trying to con-
quer the complicated mass all in a bunch. Some one
who is wiser than he knows, shouts out "break it
up,"—and there is always a way to do it if each
man on your team knows his rules and his job.
There never was a play allowed by the rules that
couldn't be offset by the rules if it were "broken
up"; and to compete successfully your team must
learn to "break it up." If each man gets a man,
the answer appears almost instantly.
A Lesson From Practical Managers
Did you ever work in a factory where the man-
agement saw an improvement on an existing pro-
duct and decided to go into the business of manu-
facturing the improved article? Did they just go
ahead and make something that looked like what
they wanted? Not generally. More probably they
would "break it up"; separate the idea into its com-
ponent parts, put the different difficulties to be over-
come in their proper sequence, and then attempt to
solve and correlate them afterward. They looked
up the supply of raw material; they investigated ex-
isting basic patents; they studied the feasibility of
certain machines for carrying out the process, the
power required to drive the machine, the sequence
of necessary operations and their probable cost, and
the probable market. These and probably more
questions must be pretty definitely settled, all of
which exercise a control over the final answer—"It
is feasible or it is not."
That is analysis and that is what you are develop-
ing when you properly apply yourself to the study
of engineering. Your Faculty "breaks up" the cur-
riculum into four or five years, and into several
separate courses, which later on you will correlate
as you use the information they provide you. It
falls upon you in studying a single problem in a
course, to analyze it, to "break it up," and master
each part, and thus form the habit of applying this
law which is always working in small and large un-
dertakings and which, while seldom written, never-
theless exists, is important and, in fact, must be
lived up to if you are to succeed.
Immense Power Project for the Southwest
In order to take advantage of the potention power
possibilities of the Colorado River, a Colorado Riv-
er Commission has been created by an act of Con-
gress and the seven states of California, Arizona,
Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana.
President Harding has appointed Herbert Hoover,
Secretary of Commerce, as Federal chairman.
The creation of this commission is the first step
in what promises to become one of the greatest of
our national improvements, involving, over a term
of years, an expenditure of several hundred millions
of either private or public funds. Each of the States
is interested in the power and irrigation to be de-
rived from the river. Considerable conflict has al-
ready developed and the commission was, there-
fore, created in order to give the territory to be
benefited equal opportunity.
There is practically no power developed on the
river at the present time but it has possibilities of
developing six million horsepower as an incident to
development of irrigation storage. Some of this
horsepower is urgently needed at the present time
in southern California and Arizona. The progress
in long distance transmission will yet bring this en-
tire volume of horsepower into possible national
use.

The Winter Sports Arena
A Proposition Requiring the Consideration and
Support of the Entire Campus
It is the privilege of the students of the Univer- The construction of this artificial lake would be a
sity of Michigan to indulge in outdoor athletics the
entire year, the cold climate of Ann Arbor affording
a great variety of winter sports. However, we are
not able to take full advantage of this opportunity,
owing to the limited skating facilities at our dis-
posal. Instead of seeking a plan for overcoming
this deficiency, many of the students substitute in-
door sports, particularly dancing, which, although
admittedly pleasurable, has neither the benefit nor
the "kick," to speak in the vernacular, that ice-
skating has. Surely moonlight skating supplies as
much of a thrill as does dancing.
Professor F. N. Menefee, of the Engineering Col-

lege, has come to our assistance with a plan which,
if executed, would give the University unlimited
skating facilities. At the expense of much time and
consideration, Professor Menefee has evolved a plan
for providing a lake in the valley near the Arbor-
etum (commonly known as the Boulevard), at the
foot of Geddes Heights. This lake would be ap-
proximately eight hundred feet long by an average
of three hundred feet wide, affording space for three
standard hockey rinks with surplus space for indi-
vidual skating. This lake could be created by the
construction of a dam across the narrow outlet
from the valley. The surrounding hillsides lend
themselves admirably to tobogganing, as well as
skiing.
comparatively simple matter and is best shown by
the accompanying figure (Figure 2). The heavy
lines show the most desirable method of construc-
tion. By the simple expedient of excavating and
filling, as indicated, it is possible to retain the same
area of water with an average depth of only five
feet. The amount of water required to fill the lake
would thus be reduced to one-half the quantity
necessary if the method shown by the light lines
were used. A further advantage to be gained from
this construction is the decreased head of water,
which would lessen the seepage to a great extent
and would also allow the construction of a lower
dam of thinner section, thereby reducing the cost
appreciably.
Some have advanced the theory that water could
not be maintained in the basin. They are of the
opinion that the seepage would be so rapid that the
water would not only drain out quickly, but that in
the event of a sheet of ice forming at the top, it
would not freeze rapidly enough to prevent the
water in the bottom of the lake from seeping out,
thereby leaving an unsupported ice crust, which
would be unsafe. However, with the improved
method of construction, allowing the water to be so
shallow, the danger of an unsupported crust of ice
and of breaking through is obviated. An answer
to the contention regarding the rapid seepage is
found in the well based belief that the nature of the
soil in this vicinity is such that it would permit but
a negligible amount of seepage.
The rainfall drainage from these hills would prob-
ably be sufficient to furnish the lake with water,

but in the event of its inability to supply enough,
it would be a simple matter to pump water from the
Huron River.
It is estimated that the cost would not exceed
twelve thousand dollars, which includes the cost of
a pump, if one should prove necessary. Several
suggestions have been advanced relative to the fi-
nancing of the project. Some feel that the Board
of Regents should be appealed to for help, while
others believe that the management and financing
could be effected through the formation of a "Win-
ter Sports Association," which would be under the
jurisdiction of the present Athletic Association. By
selling each student an annual ticket for a dollar
and a half, which would permit him to skate or
toboggan at any time thruout the school year, about
eight thousand dollars could be raised, part of which
could be applied to amortization of the first cost and
the remainder used as an operating fund. Cornell
University has used the latter system very success-
fully for ten or twelve years. If the number of stu-
dents skating at the crowded Coliseum or on the
perilous Huron River, is any indication, the project
as outlined could be put into successful operation
here.
In view of the fact that the owner of Weinberg's
Coliseum is seriously considering the sale of the
property on which it is located, it is urgent that
some definite action be taken without delay. Mr.
Weinberg does not find the Coliseum a paying
proposition because of the short period in which
it produces revenue. The popularity of the Coli-
seum for the last sixteen years as a skating rink
proves the popularity of the sport, even under con-
ditions not as favorable as the proposed Winter
Sports Arena, would provide.
President Burton is throughly in sympathy with
efforts toward this end, as is Doctor Sundwall, di-
rector of the Student Welfare Department, who rec-
ommends it from a health as well as an athletic
standpoint. So it will be seen that all that is need-
ed to push this plan to completion is a solid campus
backing. Therefore, let everyone put his shoulder
to the wheel and the University will soon acquire
a valuable health and athletic asset.
New Sine Wave Unit
A new unit generating a perfect sine wave is be-
ing installed in the E.E. laboratory, one of a new
G.E. design. The shaft is driven up to 1800 r.p.m.
by a direct current motor ,\vhich furnishes power
for two 3-phase alternators. The wave produced
by these machines is as near the true sine wave as
any generator now extant can produce.
The usefulness of the equipment will become evi-
dent when it is used to calibrate meters, etc. One
of the generators will supply the correct voltage
and the other the necessary amperage. This could
be done with other generating sets, but a disadvan-
tage always arose, in that when the required power
factor was attained, the exact voltage or amperage
was never being supplied, the operation of adjusting
these being a laborious one. The new plant, how-
ever, has a special adjustment for maintaining the
power factor required at any voltage or amperage.
This consists simply of a hand screw upon one of
the generators which shifts the position of the
stator.
New Engine for Mechanical Laboratory
The mechanical laboratory is usually conceded
to be one of the best equipped laboratories of its
kind in any of the larger universities. While it has

THE NEW UN1FL0W ENGINE
not such a great number of engines and turbines as
some of the other engineering colleges have, it does
have an engine of nearly every individual type.
Recently a new engine, representing another type,
known as the Uniflow Steam Engine, made its ap-
pearance. This machine, which is considered to be
the latest and most economical design of commer-
cial steam engine, will probably not be ready for
operation for a month. It is a high speed machine,
equipped with piston valves and an automatic gov-
ernor, capable of developing ninety horsepower at
three hundred revolutions per minute. One of the
novel features is the piston valve which after ex-
hausting the cylinder reopens to prevent the com-
pression from becoming too high, allowing the com-
pressed steam to escape to the other end of the cyl-
inder where it may be utilized to better advantage.
Another part of the equipment is the condenser
which is to be connected to the engine. It is the
latest type of surface condenser and is manufac-
tured by the C. H. Wheeler Co.
The engine when ready for operation, will be used
in M.E. 8 and research work.

COLLEGE NOTES
(Continued from Page 24)
The Frosh are Photographed
The members of the Freshman Class were start-
led three weeks ago upon entering their Descrip.
classes, when their instructors handed each of them
a large card about one foot long, bearing their name,
age, and high school from which they graduated.
They were told to stand in line and await their turn
to have their pictures taken. They were even more
startled when they discovered the ingenious method
which had been worked out to secure at once, a full
front view and a profile of them.
The plan is one which Prof. Miller, head of the
Drawing Department, has worked out, and one from
which he expects great results. In order to be as
economical as possible, only fairly crude instru-
ments were used in making the pictures, but the
results have been quite remarkable.
The student was seated in a corner between two
white screens which met each other at an angle
of 90 degrees. At his right, and close to his face
was placed a mirror, and a slot, in which he inserted
his card. The film of the camera, which was a
small portable affair, was fitted with a special screen,
so that two pictures could be taken on the space
of film originally necessary for one exposure. The
finished picture, which cost, by the way, 7 cents,
shows a clear front and profile view as well as the
man's name, age, etc. A 1000 watt incandescent
lamp with a reflector furnished the necessary illum-
ination.
Prof. Miller instituted a plan similar to this when
he was connected with the University of Illinois,
and it is now a regular part of the registration
there. The photograph furnishes information about
a man that is inaccessible in any other way. It
helps to size up a student when any question arises
during his college career or even afterwards. It
assists the authorities in remembering men, and
keeping in close touch with them, and it furnishes

a very good supplement to the other data kept in
the university records. Prof. Miller intends to
prove to the authorities here that his idea is well
worth while, and that it is necessary to the admin-
istrative branch of the university.
The Engineer

Who is the man designs our pumps with judgment, skill and
care?
Who is the man that builds 'on and who keeps them in repair?
Who has to shut them down because the valve seats disappear?
The bearing-wearing, gearing-tearing mechanical engineer:
Who buys his juice for half a cent and wants to charge a
dime?
Who when we've signed the contract can't deliver half the
time?
Who thinks a loss of twenty-six per cent is nothing queer?
The volt inducing, load-reducing electrical engineer:
Who is it takes a transit out to find a sewer to tap?
Who then wjth care extreme locates the junction on the map?
Who is it goes to dig it up and finds it nowhere near?
The mud-bespattered, torn and tattered civil engineer:
Who thinks without his products we would all be in the
lurch?
Who has a heathen ideol which he designates Research?
Who tints the creeks, perfumes the air, and makes the land-
scapes drear?
The stink-evolving, grass-dissolving chemical engineer:
Who is the man who'll draw a plan for everything you desire
From a trans-Atlantic liner to a hairpin made of wire?
With "ifs" and "ands," "howe'ers"' and "huts'' who makes his
meaning clear?
The work-disdaining, fee-retaining consulting engineer:
Who builds a road for, fifty years that disappears in two?
Then changes his identity, so no one's left to sue?
Who covers all the traveled roads with filthy oily smear?
The bump-providing, rough-on-riding highway engineer:
Who takes the pleasure out of life and makes existence hell?
Who'll fire a real good-looking one because she can not spell?
Who substitutes a dictaphone for coral-tinted ear?
The penny-chasing, dollar-wasting efficiency engineer.
Engineer's Ramble Song
Air—Oh, Didn't IPe Ramble
There was a bold young engineer
Who's just got out of school;
He had a lot of great big books,
And knew he was no fool.
They set him marking station-pins,
But he didn't know the code,
So they ditched him twelve miles out of camp,
And let him hunt the road.
Oh, didn't he ramble, etc.
He got a job as electric man,
And thought he'd make some tin.
They sent him up a big tall pole
To put a feeder in;
He lost his grip and tumbled1 back,
But grabbed the wires bright,
Then hung on for a moment till
The juice put out his light.
Oh, didn't he ramble, etc.
He then went down into the depths,
Where Satan runs the plant.
He wanted to see the chief engineer
But Satan said, "You can't;
There are no engineers down here,
For that could never be."
Then he said, "I guess I'll ramble on;
This is no place for me."
Oh, didn't he ramble, etc.
He then ascended up above,
And knocked at the Golden Gate.
The city—it was full of laws—
He saw he was too late.
They wanted him to take his place
Upon the royal throne,
But he said, "I guess I'll ramble on;
I'd rather be alone."
And still he rambled, etc.
THE FILTRATION PLANT FOR DETROIT
(Continued from Page 17)
to a point under the cable-way, at the south end
of the work, and by the cable-ways transferred to
any point within the entire area of the filter plant
and the concrete deposited in place. Each flat car
carried one bucket, a train consisting of two cars,
one for the empty, and one for the full bucket.
The cable-ways were an important feature of the
contractor's plant. Each cable-way consisted of two
timber towers no feet high, running on seven par-
allel lines of rails at each end, and counter-balanced
to withstand the strain of the cable. The carrying
cable extended north and south from head tower
to tail tower, a distance of 1,000 feet, along which
the buckets were hauled by a lighter auxiliary cable,
the lateral or east and west motion being accom-
plished by moving the connected pair of towers on
the tracks. The towers were moved at a rate of
200 feet per minute, and the buckets or other load
on the cables 1,200 feet per minute.
Not only the concrete, but all reinforcing steel,
structural steel, cast iron pipe and concrete forms
were conveyed by the cable ways, and excavated
material was removed in the same manner. For a
job of the nature of the filter plant or a concrete
reservoir, covering a large area, but of no great
height above the ground, the cable-way would seem
to offer the best handling and conveying solution.
Completion of Filter Plant
Bids for the Filtered Water Reservoir, which will
cover an area of nearly seven acres, and will require
over 32,000 cubic yards of concrete, were received
on February 14th and construction will start short-
ly. The structural steel for the roof of filters and
coagulation basin is practically complete, and a con-
tract for the brick superstructure and roofing will
be let in March. The filter sand and gravel and all
filter equipment will be installed during the present
year, and it is expected that the complete plant will
be in operation by May, 1923. The total cost of
the filtration plant will approximate five and a half
million dollars, equivalent to $16,000.00 per million
gallon capacity.

Illustration from "De Re Metallira" by Agricola, published in 1546
TSreakinq Ground bu dire-sebbinq
The ancients "blasted" by fire-setting—
slow, laborious, dangerous, and ineffectual.
Describing Hannibal's crossing the Alps in
218 B. C, Livy says: "The cliff heated by
fire was broken by iron tools so that not
only the beasts of burden but also the
elephants could be led down."
In "De Re Metallica" (1546) Agricola ex-
plains the early fire methods in detail—how
the sticks were prepared; how these were
piled against the face of the rock; how the
fire softened or cracked the stone for a
certain depth; and how water was some-
times dashed on the heated rock, which
was shattered by the sudden and uneven
cooling. Even as late as the 17 th century,
fire setting was practised, and an advance
of 5 feet per month in headings was often
considered good.
In May 1921, a contractor drove a total of 942.3
feet in 43^' x 6' drifts and crosscuts, using Her-
cules Dynamite. An average of 11 feet advance
was made per machine shift with a dynamite
consumption of 8.7 pounds per lineal foot. Ex-
plosives have made possible greater results in
eight hours than our ancient brethren accom-
plished in a month.
For years we have recommended the use of
Hercules Special No. 1 and Hercomite for many
kinds of work because of their high cartridge
count, and low cost per cartridge in comparison
with other dynamites. No high explosive on the
market is more economical.
A lesson on explosives economy is contained in
our booklet, "Volume vs. Weight". Write to our
Advertising Department, 941 King Street, Wil-
mington, Delaware, for a copy.

Take It From The Air
NOT only music, but news, speeches, messages
of every sort, are today being picked out of
the air.
"How has this come about?" we ask.
The new impetus given to radio development may
be definitely associated with the development of the
high power vacuum tube, for that made broadcasting
possible. And the power tube originated from a
piece of purely theoretical research, which had no
connection with radio.
When a scientist in the Research Laboratories of
the General Electric Company found that electric
current could be made to pass through the highest
possible vacuum and could be varied according to
fixed laws, he established the principle of the power
tube and laid the foundation for the "tron" group of
devices.
These devices magnify the tiny telephone currents
produced by the voice and supply them to the
antenna, which broadcasts the messages. At the
receiving end, smaller "trons", in turn, magnify the
otherwise imperceptible messages coming to them
from the receiving antenna.
Great accomplishments are not picked out of the
air. Generally, as in this case, they grow from one
man's insatiable desire to find out the "how" of
things.
Scientific research discovers the facts. Practical
applications follow in good time.

The Humanism of Engineering
By Ralph R. Tinkham, '05E
An intensely interesting treatment of a phase of
engineering upon which the success of every
engineer is dependent.
All engineers were born human. Admitting this
to be an axiom for the purpose of this discussion,
and disregarding- whether or not he remains human,
it cannot be doubted that the engineer is, therefore,
susceptible of broad sympathy with his kind, even as
are other men not of his profession.
We have had pertinent expositions in the Technic
of both the "science" and the "nescience" of
engineering. Let us touch upon a third phase
fully as broad as either. The generally accepted
definition for engineering already given is as suit-
able as any: "the art of turning the great sources
of power in nature to the use and convenience of
man". What greater source of power, what greater
force in nature is there than the human mind,-man,
himself? To mould this force the engineer must
perfect himself in the "handling of men".
The Engineer is Indispensable
Much has been said and as much has been written
in recent months about the failure of the engineer-
ing profession to assume its rightful sphere of
influence in the scheme of things. The engineer
himself was the first to awake to this fact; no one
seems to have missed him before. The occasion
was the World War where it was demonstrated
beyond contradiction not only that the engineer was
indispensable, but that the whole fabric of civil-
ization, warp of war and woof of peace alike, was
produced on a loom of his building. But when, at
last cognizant of the isolated plane to which he has
been relegated, he raises his voice in dignified
protest, what response does he get?
Instant response. An eminent banker tells the
assembled representatives of our great national
engineering societies in crisp Anglo-Saxon that the
engineer is a failure as a manager. "Leadership is
not native to him", he insists, "his enthusiasms
have been put under stern control; locked up so
that they cannot warp his judgement, they cannot
easily be released to inspire others. In fact, they
are often atrophied." The engineer of our times
is cool, cautious, severe, ascetic, disciplined through
his schooling to curb his enthusiasm.
There are other critics a-plenty, and these include
some of the most prominent industrial leaders of
our time. A weakness too often evident in their
criticisms and in those of numerous lesser lights,
is, to be sure, the fact that they are prone to "point
with pride" to certain few individuals of self made
(5)

stature as shining examples of what the engineer
is not, blissfully overlooking the unbalanced
comparison of a few startling exceptions among
"practical" men with the general run and raveling
of men classed as engineers. The eminent banker,
himself, is not above this favorite bit of stage craft.
Unfortunately for the full force of his argument he
unwittingly named at least two engineers in his
list of "great figures" in industry, one of them a
graduate of the University of Michigan. Perhaps,
too, an engineer might compare the proletariat
quite as unfavorably with such stalwart engineers
as LaTrobe, Roebling, Noble, Goethals, Hammond,
Hoover.
What shall we say of the great army of engineer
camp followers, who, because untrained and with-
out the "temperament" and "discipline" of the real
engineer, make the most noise; and because loudly
proclaiming themselves engineers, are accepted as
such by the general public which passes judgment
accordingly. Reference is made of course to those,
who, after a season on the chain or at holding a
speaking rod style themselves "civil engineers";
or to the journeymen plumbers and steam fitters,
who, when they can join the union, paint their
shingles:—"Heating and Ventillating Engineers".
Public acknowledgement of the last named travesty
was made no longer ago than this winter, by a
nationally known manufacturer of heating equip-
ment, through a full page advertisment in our
greatest national periodical. The profession has
attempted to eradicate this nuisance by instituting
state licensing laws. This, being one step toward
improvement is admirable, but inasmuch as large
numbers of legitimate engineers are engaged in
professional work of a character not requiring
registration, and as such laws are not yet general,
the plan cannot be labeled a panacea.
The Engineer has Failed to Reach the Public
Be that as it may, the fact remains that public
opinion, itself a prime all pervading force of nature,
is slow to change its course. The situation
parallels the familiar case of the double column
front page headline retracted later in a three line
paragraph set between the ads on the seventh
page. Mark the amazing admission made by a
former Mayor of Detroit not many years ago at 3.
banquet of the Detroit Engineering Society. It
was a large assembly and included in its number
several distinguished gentlemen widely and favor-
ably known in our profession, whose polished
remarks reflected a degree of culture too seldom
emulated by our rank and file. His Honor arose
after a sparkling introduction and expressed him-
self first as greatly surprised at the character of the
gathering, because, as he explained, when he had
accepted the invitation to the banquet of the
"Engineering Society", he supposed we were the
men who stoked the fires of the heating plants in
the school buildings and city hall!
One more incident will illustrate a phase of the
professional failing. Only recently the writer was
present at a crowded meeting of a state engineer-
ing society. The speaker, an engineer and a
member of the society was also a successful and
well known business man. His subject was one
of vital interest to the metropolitan community in
which we met, and related to a public utilities
problem involving possible savings to the citizens of
hundreds of thousands of dollars. The speaker
even made special appeal for the dissemination of
the data which he had collected at considerable
expenditure of time and labor. While this has
doubtless been done to a strictly limited extent by
the comparative few then present, yet the news
papers, of which there are several, had little if any-
thing to say regarding the meeting, and no editorial
comment whatever. The conclusion is obvious.
The engineer fails to reach the public.
Our Professional Tree Needs Pruning
But we speak only of symptoms. The source is
deeper. Getting back to fundamentals, the engineer
has narrowed his field; and he has not only kept
his field too narrow, but the whole tendency in
recent years seems to have been to pull in the walls
still more, continuously narrowing the prospect like
a pinched out vein. Engineering was evolved from
military necessity, and perhaps as a profession was
born before the gates of Zaragorsa when engineers
of the Great Commander demonstrated their ability
to accomplish the impossible, as their professional
descendents have repeatedly done since that time.
The first engineers on civil works in this countrv
were military engineers from that same army, and
they have left the castle gates of Zaragorsa and the
cry of their intrepid fellows to be immortalized by
the insignia of our own military corps of engineers.
The first division of the trunk of our professional
tree came when the arts of peace supplanted those
of war. Then there grew two great branches, the
civil and the military. Years passed and almost
within our own times the great civil branch grew
one by one several limbs, mechanical, electrical and
mining. As time went by these limbs threw out
twigs. The civil branch, having dwindled to a
smaller limb grew numerous twigs of its own, rail-
road engineers, bridge engineers, hydraulic,
structural, municipal; the mechanical became like-
wise divided, and the electrical also, as did the
others. Then the twigs burst into veritable bushes


Page 7

TEC II NIC

with shoots of almost every conceivable technical
appellation, until now what have we? Name them
yourself; we have with us the window dressing
engineer and the odor engineer as recent acquisi-
tions.
"Nescience of Engineering" began hopefully by
lopping off a couple of vigorous shoots, the
"theoreticians" those "winged footed messengers of
the gods", and the laboratory hermits, the "closeted
magicians", who of course, although designated b)
the name, are not properly engineers at all bin
physicists, chemists, and philosophers, and as sucV
necessary and of value to the advancement of that
knowledge of the "sources of power in nature"
which is indispensable to the engineer, whose
progress is measured by his "successive building on
the findings of others". For how can engineering
be regarded as a science when we are reminded
that after a painstaking analysis of our calculations
we add 25% as a factor of safety?
The bushy top of our tree, however, with each
engineer on his own little twig is a symbol of
instability and narrow mindedness. The profession
loses thereby in solidarity and sturdiness, and the
individual becomes compressed into the groove of
his specialty; he mistakes artizan for the art of his
profession, and in doing so is overlooking the richest
and broadest field open to him, the human one.
Management—An Opportunity for the Engineer
It is not that the engineer is unwelcome in that
wider field. To quote our banker once more,—-
bankers as financial godfathers of enterprise,
"yearn for a sure thing and welcome the engineer
with his mathematical accuracy" in corporation
management, but with his "natural handicap"
increased by present methods of training he has
proved a disappointment and a failure as a manager;
and if he would occupy such positions with success
his education and training must be profoundly
modified". A statement having the same signific-
ance is attributed to the Professor Hugo Munstcr-
berg: "We live in the day of the scientist and the
expert, and he who closes his ears to their advice
will never dig the first potatoes from his acre".
To realize further that there is not only a welcome
but a positive need in that field we have only to
refer to the recent report of the Federated
Engineering Societies' Committee on Elimination
of Waste in Industry where we discover that more
than 50% of the responsibility for waste is with
management, and less than 25%, with labor. In
other words those who now plan and direct the
industries with their myrid combinations of labor,
materials, and appliances must be held more to
blame for the shortcomings than all other elements
in industry combined. Does this seem hardly less
condemnation of the non-technical management
than that of the technical, already quoted? The
more evident, then, is the need and the opportunity
for the engineer. Finally, our most recent editorial
plaint warns us that "the most profound need of
American business today is for men of trained
imagination to guide technical processes and
mechanical practices on their human side to
effective conclusion". How frequently our theme
recurs, "technical processes on their human side".
Apply Knowledge of Human Nature—Schwab
On one occassion last year, Charles M. Schwab
said, "I am firmly of the opinion that if we approach
the industrial situation of the moment in a practical
spirit, applying the results of our experience and
our knowledge of human nature to the problems
immediately before us, we shall come nearer to
making this a better and happier world than we
can by studing all the books, attending all the
conventions, and passing all the resolutions that
could ever be dreamed of". Again, the solution is
better management, and the secret is knowledge of
human nature; know how to handle men.
In the life of the average engineer it would seem
that the handling of men is an ordinary responsibil-
ity, a primary requisite in his accomplishments. He
has hardly more than left school until, as squad
boss in the drafting room or chief of party in the
field, he is directing the work of others. He is no
longer responsible merely for his own actions, his
own output, but he is held accountable for the
results produced by an expensive party of other
individuals. He is thrust into executive respons-
ibility willy-nilly, and in the usual order of events
he continues to acquire more. For preparation he
is well equipped with the "mathematics of engineer-
ing" but has he been guided over the first pitfalls
on the road to human engineering? Not at all. He
goes forth like a newly made midshipman in
command of a fog enveloped ship off a rock bound
coast.
Yet the dual office of the engineer is recognized
in the profession itself. He is supposed to direct
as well as design. The subordinate grades of
membership in our national engineering societies
require that the incumbent shall have had
"responsible charge of work", and only the highest
grades stipulate the ability to design as well as
direct. Primarily the engineer must get things
done, done right of course, but get them done;
"after all the building's the thing". Yet we are
early taught the rudiments of design and then
thrust forth to acquire the fundamentals in direct-

On March 18, the entire engineering world
mourned the loss of Cornelius Donovan. With
brief services held at Oak Hill cemetery, attended
by the faculty and undergraduates representing
every department of the University, and with four
of his classmates of 1872 as pall bearers, his desire
to have an engineer's funeral was gratified.
Every engineer, whether a graduate or a student,
will do well to study the
life of Cornelius Donovan.
His life will stand out for
many years to come as
an example of the great
service that an engineer
of the true type can do for
his fellow men. A study
of his life will show that
he not only made himself
a great engineer; he
made himself one of the
country' greatest citizens.
Probably one of the
greatest obstacles to the
development of the great
Middle West, has been
the seeming impossibility
of obtaining a navigable
passage from the Missis-
sippi River through its
deltas to the Gulf of
Mexico. This river, the
key to the prosperity of
half a nation, until a
decade ago was useless to
the territory it enclosed as a practical commercial
outlet to the sea. Ever since the days of the Civil
War, when the first deep-draft river gun boats
were conceived, futile attempts had been made to
combat the ever-growing sand formations at the
numerous mouths of the Mississippi. The late
Professor J. B. Davis defined this problem as the
"Protean puzzle of the nation." But for the life
work of two men. Dr. Eads and Mr. Donovan, we
have every reason to believe that the task would
be still incomplete. It was not a task that merely
required engineering knowledge. It required a life
of study and service, and Mr. Donovan gave that
life.

Cornelius Donovan
Mr. Donovan's youth was spent in Ann Arbor.
He graduated from the local high school, and enter-
ed the Engineering College. In 1872 he graduated
with the degree of Civil Engineer. Upon graduation
Mr. Donovan did not immediately become connect-
ed with river work. For two years he was Assistant
Engineer of the Ann Arbor, Jackson, and Lansing
Railroad. In 1874, Professor Davis, then very
active in the research of
the lake survey, interested
Mr. Donovan in that
work. Mr. Donovan
worked for two years in
the survey of the northern
lakes. He proved to be
very capable ,and he soon
drew the attention of the
government e n g in e e r s.
After these two years of
training, he was sent to
Port Eads, the center of
the Mississippi improve-
ment project, under Dr.
James Eads. He was to
spend the rest of his life
in the completion of the
great task he saw at-
tempted here.
Mr. Eads had been com-
missioned by the govern-
ment to build a channel
through the South Pass,
the smallest of the mouths
of the Mississippi. The
task, at first glance, seemed merely the building of
eight miles of jetties, which would confine the river
until it reached the Gulf, and thus obviate the
forming of sand bars. But the task proved colos-
sal. The sand formations seemed inevitable, and
even after the jetties were completed, the sand was
deposited at the end and gradually worked its way
up the channel.
For five years Mr. Donovan worked under Dr.
Eads. He devoted all his powers to the study of
"his river." He became expert to such a degree
that, at the death of Dr. Eads, he was placed in
charge of all government work on the Mississippi.

By Thomas J. Mitchell
Assistant Professor of Surveying
The use of the aeroplane in surveying, like other
new and spectacular developments, is liable to be
over advertised to its detriment, so it is well for us
as engineers to analyze the present status of the
science. The aeroplane itself can hardly be classed
as a surveying instrument, for it is the camera that
does the work, the aeroplane serving simply as a
device for transporting the camera. Historically,
photographic surveying is not a new development.
The value of perspective to engineers was known
long before the camera was invented. In 1839,
when the discoveries of Niepee and Daguerre were
presented to the French Chamber of Deputies, the
no great difficulty in getting pictures by suspending
a camera in an aeroplane. The speed with which an
aeroplane travels and the vibrations of the craft
make it necessary to design a special camera having
a very rapid lens, and such lenses have a very limit-
ed field. This difficulty has been overcome by
using a camera having three lenses, two of which
are set at equal angles with the center one, and are
so placed that the three make a continuous picture.
From a surveying viewpoint, one fact cannot be.
over emphasized. Pictures are not maps. A map
must have a definite scale and have its details
platted in the proper relationship to each other.

Mosaic Map Composition
aid which photography would render to surveying
was predicted. After some preliminary experi-
mentation, the first use was made of it by the corps
of engineers of the French army in 1849. Since
then, photographic surveys have been made in
practically all civilized countries. Canada has
surveyed 30,000 square miles and the United States
u.ooo square miles in this manner. The advent of
the aeroplane has introduced no new principles but,
of course, has introduced problems in design of
equipment and details of operation peculiar to it-
self.
Many Difficulties Are Encountered
Numerous experiments have demonstrated con-
clusivelv that under favorable conditions there is
Pictures, being perspective, do not have this quality.
A casual glance at a landscape snapshot will verify
the foregoing. The objects in the foreground have
a much larger scale than similar objects in the back-
ground. If the camera is not level, a further dis-
tortion takes place.
A map, in general, must show three coordinates
of each point it represents, namely, two horizonal
coordinates, latitude and longitude, or coordinates
similar to latitude and longitude, and also the
elevation of the point with respect to some definite
datum surface. In reducing the photographs used
in map making, some scheme must be devised that
will produce results within allowable errors. In
photographs there are first, errors produced by
(9)

imperfections in the camera itself, and second,
errors introduced in the method of plotting per-
spectives. The latter are relatively large, and, as a
result, the camera, as formerly used, had to be re-
stricted to areas of very rugged relief where these
errors could be regarded as negligible. Hence, in
this country the camera was useful only in such
regions as the Rocky Mountians. This accounts
for the small area surveyed by this method. If the
camera is carried in an aeroplane over territory
having great differences in elevation, large errors

VIEW SHOWING CITY ZONING
are introduced because the tops of hills, being near-
er the camera than the valleys, are photographed to
a larger scale than the latter. Experiments are be-
ing carried on at present to find a means of correct-
ing this trouble and eventually a remedy may be
found.
Present Methods of Plotting are Inaccurate
The theory of aerial surveying is relatively
simple. If the area to be mapped is a plane, and the
picture is taken with a plate or film parallel to this
plane, from the properties of similar triangles, the
negative will have a scale depending upon the
focal length of the lense and the perpendicular
distance the lense is above the ground. For
example, under the above conditions, if the aero-
plane is 10,000 feet above the ground and the
camera lens has a focal length of ten inches, then
the negative will have a natural scale of i in 12,000,
or in other words, i inch will equal 1,000 feet.
Working conditions make it necessary to employ
many corrections. Very few places on the surface
of the land are level. The altitude of an aeroplane
is measured by the air pressure, and hence has a
wide limit of error. At present there is no way of
keeping a camera in an aeroplane horizontal, if it
is desired to make a map to a scale of say I inch
equals I mile, under favorable conditions the tilt of
the camera may be neglected, but for larger scale
maps it is far from negligible. Future experiments
may show a way, either to keep the camera horizon-
tal, as for instance by a further development of the
gyroscope, or some means of recording the tilt of
the camera at the instant the exposure is made. At
present the negatives are corrected by trial by the
use of an instrument similar to an enlarging camera.
The negative is fastened in a slide that can be tilted,
and adjusted both horizontally and vertically. Such
control points, three or more in number, as can be
identified on the negative, are plotted to scale on
tracing linen or paper, and placed in another holder.
The negative is then adjusted until the control
points are projected in their proper relationship
and scale. The tracing is then replaced by sensitiz-
ed paper and a print made. Similar prints are then
made from each negative. The prints overlap and
then they are trimmed and matched so that a
mosaic is formed. If any area is missed, and this is
often the case, it must be replaced by a field recon-
naissance. The mosaic obtained in this manner is
not, strictly speaking, a map, for it does not indicate
differences of elevation, but it can be used for such
purposes as do not require elevations. A method
of getting differences of elevation may be devised in
the future, but on the basis of experience gained in
other types of camera surveying, such a develop-
ment does not look promising.
Use Under Special Conditions
There are many instances in which pictures
serve as well as or better than maps, and in this
field aeroplane photography is supreme. One
example is in city zoning. It is important to know
what kind of buildings are already erected in differ-
ent parts of a city, and the aeroplane photograph
shows this to perfection. A rapidly developing use

Author's Note
In accepting the invitation of your editor to write
this article, I have decided to write on a subject
very distant from the minds of the students at
Michigan. I hope that the reading of this short
article may induce further reading upon this
subject, because many students may find them
selves thrown into a field where this is the issue of
the hour.
America at one time was practically self
contained. The whole world demanded our raw
products and raw materials in large volumes and
we consumed most of our finished products within
the boarders of our own land. But today we find
ourselves great importers of raw materials, which
upon examination prove to come mostly from
agricultural or non manufacturing countries. This
condition forces us to export to these countries
large quantities of our manufactured products in
order to maintain an economic balance of our trade,
and with the added manufacturing facilities which
our great industries have as a result of this, we
must find even more extensive foreign markets for
our goods, in order to reduce the overhead now
burdening these industries.
Beyond this we find that our best customer*
in foreign markets owe us vast sums of money, and
the only way we will be able to collect these sums
is to take merchandise from them; and if we
permit them to sell us manufactured goods or
merchandise we in turn will have to find and.
develop new world markets for the surplus products
which we thus have.
Thus we must realize that stability and
restored normal prosperity in our land must be
based on the development of foreign trade and
foreign markets in a measure never before realized
by America. This new era in world trade has
come to America, whether we will it or no, and the
energy and vitality of young men facing todays
business problems is going to be absorbed in this
problem for many years to come.
J ('
A Vital Problem to Every Citizen
You may feel individually that this problem
does not interest you, but it does.
The Michigan factor}- worker, the Kansas
farmer, the Colorado miner, has as much interest
in the establishment of an American Merchant
Marine as has the man who toils on the vessel or on
the docks in our great ocean ports. Unless
America meets changed conditions from within,
and changed exterior conditions brought about by
the late war, its export business will fail, and there
will not be a profitable demand for its finished or
raw products. This will cause manufacturing
operations to close, and when factories have to shut
down, the industrial worker cannot purchase the
the product of the miner or the farmer, and thus
functions the endless chain of effect.
Continuity of employment throughout all of
America depends on the producer being able to
export his surplus product.
Immediate Action is Needed
This means the establishment of a Merchant
Marine under the American Flag. No miracle of
genius can establish such a fleet, because like in all
other endeavors, efficiency on the seas naturally
is held by those nations who have had the most
practice. Given the same experience Yankee
ability will master the situation and succeed, but
we will have no Merchant Marine except at the
price of time and money to get the volume and
learn the business.
We will have no American Merchant Marine
unless everyone regardless of his occupation realizes
that he must bear his part of the burden of this
price we must pay.
As Chairman Albert Lasker, of the United
States Shipping Board recently said:
"The claims of an American Merchant Marine
must rest on its economic necessity to the American
People as a whole. The claims for an American
Merchant Marine can rest on the proof that John
Smith, who knows and cares nothing about the
shipping business but who ought to know and care

a lot about it, should be willing, if necessary, to be
taxed, and ought if necessary, be taxed, in order
that Bill Jones' goods can be carried in American
rather than foreign bottoms. In our Republic our
common good fortune is reliant on the agencies
essential to that good fortune."
Government Support Necessary
A substantial subsidy for American Shipping is
the advisable relief measure. The immediate future
may see the enactment of such legislation as will
provide annual remuneration for shipping, with
varied forms of indirect aid. If the White House
Plan contains a method of so called "painless ex-
traction" of funds to finance such a measure it will
pass Congress easily. If the measure calls for a
direct appropriation annually, the chance for such
legislation is doubtful.
It is hard to say what form this legislature will
take, but it is hoped by those associated with its
development that it will include the following
features.
1. Direct payment to steamship companies of
funds derived from five or ten percent of the
customs receipts, aggregating $15,000,000 to $30,-
000,000. Payment also of $4,000,000 derived from
new tonnage taxes.
2. Establishment of a construction loan fund of
$100,000,000 available at once, or $25,000,000 avail-
able for each of four years.
3. Creation of a naval reserve of officers, crews
and ships, with compensation to men equal to about
one month's pay annually.
4. Relief from income taxes and greater allow-
ance for depreciation in tax returns.
5. Sale of ships on liberal terms at the world
market prices.
6. Requirements that at least 50 percent of
immigrants must come in American vessels.
7. Enforcement of Section 28 of the Jones acl
restricting preferential railroad rates to goods or.
American Ships, revision of Navigation Laws,
extension of coastwise laws to Phillippines, and
discontinuance of Army and Navy transport ser-
vices on the Pacific.
The proponents of an American Merchant Marine
must rest their case far beyond the grounds of
National defense, which to most of us is academic
and far away. To those who realize the potential
possibilities of the future, it is a matter of deepest
concern.
In conclusion permit me to suggest that the
readers of this volume, students present and past,
give this subject the consideration that the nation's
most vital problem should receive.

at Victoria Mine, Michigan
By J. J. Bebeau, '22E
Back in' '1900 prospectors and miners, after ex-
ploring and diamond drill-testing in the stone bluffs,
skirting the Ontonagon River valley, decided there
was copper to be found in those hills and went
after it. They began operations to sink a shaft, or
mine hole, in what was apparently the most logical
place to look for copper but which also happened to
be a very inaccessible point in relation to towns and
settlements. A wagon trail passed by, connecting
two settlements thirty miles apart and passing
over hilly wooded country. The nearest railroad
and town of Rockland was four and a half miles
distant over this trail from the prospected property
which gained the name of Victoria mine. But the
Ontonagon River valley was situated between the
mine and town and made a very rough country to be
traversed. The river was halfway of the distance
and, as surveyed, was 540 ft. below the mine prop-
erty. The trail made the shortest route and climbed
over the hills usually in the shortest way. Over the
largest hills one on each side of the valley the grade
made was as much as 18 to 20% for a distance of a
half mile. The old wagon trail presented a very dif-
ficult means of communication especially in wet
weather. A team of horses could draw a load of a ton
and a half in a day. Cartage of supplies and coal was
difficult and expensive.
, In sinking the shaft to the copper veins steam was
used to run the hoisting machinery and, in the up-
per levels to run the water pumps and drilling ma-
chines, coal had to be hauled from the Rockland spur
at a cost of $5.50 per ton so that steam soon became a
very large expense. When the second hundred foot
level was reached compressed air was needed for the
mine drills. As soon as copper was struck a stamp
mill for crushing and separating the rock from the
copper had to be built. The necessity of operating
an air compressor and stamp mill called for a great
deal more power. With the price of copper very
much lower than at the present time and with the
means available for transportation at that time the
use of coal as a source of power was almost out of
the question. Railroad companies, could not be
prevailed upon to build roads over the rough
country to a green and somewhat uncertain in-
dustry. The mine operators understood that it would
be necessary to either find sources of power or to
build a railroad themselves, which was a difficult
feat in itself. They early saw that the West Branch
of the Ontonagon River which flowed about a mile
to the south offorded available power which was
going to waste. No extraordinary difficulty stood
in the way of putting the river to work.
Hydro-electric companies were called in and sur-
veys were made of the river. No one would make
a venture to furnish power for the required capacity
of machinery wanted, and, furthermore, since, no
one had at that time devised a method of stamping
copper directly with electricity no step was taken
toward electric development. Drilling machines
cannot be run by electricity at present with any
degree of efficiency. The one final necessity in run-
ning a .mining outfit is a compressed air plant
Finally under guarantee to furnish 4000 horse power
Chas. A. Taylor, a civil engineer of Montreal, Canada,
was given the job to design and build his type of
hydraulic air-compressor, which is called the Taylor
Hydraulic Air-Compressor. The story goes that
the inventor first got his idea from the action of
water in the ice covered St. Lawrence River. It is
said that in observing the water and air under pres-
sure spurting out of the air holes, in the river, he
thought of the idea of developing such action for in-
dustrial purposes. Under the supervision of Mr.
Taylor part of the water of the West Branch of On-
tonagon River was converted into power in the form
of compressed air at 115 pounds pressure, without
any moving machinery, at a total plant efficiency of
22 percent.
Source of Power
Ideal conditions of head flow and topography
prevailed for the installation of the Taylor air-com-
pressor. The Wrest Branch has a reliable source of
water supply. During the summer it has a little
larger flow than the Huron River. During the
other seasons the flow swells to twice this amount.
It has two tributaries, one having its headwaters in
the chain of lakes on the Michigan-Wisconsin
border and drains directly from Cisco Lake, the other
having its headwaters in Gogebic Lake. At the out-
let of this lake has been placed a dam which raises
the water 30 in. above the low water mark.

The Ontonagon River flows into Lake Superior
about 35 miles from Lake Gogebic. Since the dif-
ference in elevation between lakes is about 7oo ft.
there is plenty head to be developed in that distance,
at the falls and rapids.
The Diverting Dam and Canal
The topography of the river near Victoria Mine is
particularly well adapted to power development.
About two miles from the mine the West Branch

ARTIFICIAL GKYSER FROM BLOW-OFF
emerges from between the hills to an old flood
plain. It has worked a tortuous channel thru the
plain and flows northward toward the mine for a
mile where it turns eastward thru a little canyon
which it has gorged out some 100 feet in the
sandstone. At one point the north side of this
gorge suddenly changes from the vertical to a slope
of about 40 degrees. The high steep bank above
this point became a natural site for the position of
a plant.
Where the river emerges from the hills into the
channel a dam about 300 ft. long was built across
the river which raised the water 20 ft. from the bed.
At right angles to this, control gates were installed.
A diverting dam was built from the dam thru the
flats and around the side hills north of the river to
a point on the bank over the gorge. Here a waste-
way over the gorge walls was put. A little below
a gated structure was placed for emergencies and
to prevent somewhat the flow of anchor ice. From
there a straitaway channel was built 300 ft. long with
cross section of 350 sq. ft. Having diverted the
water to this point a large potential energy was
available. What did the engineer do with it? It
may be said in a few words that he dropped the
water into the ground 300 ft. horizontally 500 ft.
and out into the river, an elevation some 70 feet be-
low the canal, and in the meantime tapped off com-
pressed air to the tune of 4000 H. P. This was the
culmination of the inventors idea which came to
him while watching the air bubles thru the St. Law-
rence ice jams. What was actually done to carry
out Mr.Taylor's scheme was this:—
Construction
At a point as noted above, where the river bank
suddenly changes from the vertical to a more repos-
ing angle, an 18 ft. shaft was sunk by miners at
about 70 degrees from horizontal toward the canal.
At a depth of 283 ft. below river level a horizontal
tunnel 10 ft. high was drifted for 40 ft. At this
point the tunnel was enlarged into a chamber 26
ft. high and of the same 18 ft. width. These di-
mensions were continued for 227 ft. at which point
the chamber was gradually widened 57 ft. and the
footings raised to within 21 ft. of the hanging, or
roof, of chamber. These dimensions were used to
the end making it a horizontal chamber with a level
roof and total length of 3i8ft. Then three 300 ft.
vertical shafts were put from the canal to the
chamber with center line 9 ft. from the end of the
chamber.
During the excavation the shafts and chamber
were rid of water by steam pumps for the first hun-
dred feet and compressed air pumps in the lower
levels. All work was done thru very laminated lime
stone. Dynamite was used. No particular difficulty
was presented in excavation. Digging the lower
shaft first, at an angle enabled them to haul the
material more easily and at a point on the rver bank
where it could be more easily disposed of.
The principle aimed for was that the water in
dropping down these shafts would produce a
vacuum and suck down air which would separate
from the water and be compressed in a chamber
above the water level. The water would flow
thru the chamber, and thru the tunnel and up thru
the lower shaft. At the lower end of the chamber

a small pocket was dug out above the roof and a
shaft of workable size was drifted at an angle of 30
degrees to intersect the outlet shaft. This served
to permit running from the roof of the chamber of
two pipes, one of which is a 24 in. air supply pipe,
which has its intake at the level of the roof of the
chamber. The other is the automatic blowout pipe,
which projects down to the water level about twelve
feet from the bottom. These pipes were encased in
a shaft filled with concrete.
The three vertical shafts were smoothed off with
concrete to 5 ft. dia. At the lower end of these shafts
20 ft. tubes were set projecting 16 ft. into the cham-
ber with 2 ft. flare at the bottom. A couple of feet
below these, conical shaped concrete blocks were
placed. The most important purpose seems to be
the protection of sandstone footing of the chamber
and the immediate spreading of water in all direct-
ions, away from the shaft.
At the upper end of the vertical shafts steel tubes
were placed into the concrete with 16 feet of tube
projecting above the canal bed. Inside of this and
free to move up and down was placed another tube
riveted at its upper end to a cylindrical casting cast
convex at the top. On the outer side of this casting
was attached a circular header with two sets of
pipes. One was a set of 8 in. vertical pipes planned
to serve as the air intake, the other was a set of large
number of horizontal pipes with openings project-
ing inward just over the top of the casting. The
whole piece was attached to a vertical shafting by
a horizontal cast cross peice, which could be lowered or
raised by a casting screwed on the upper end of the
capstan. Screwed on the upper end of the shaft-
ing, made to fit inside of the horizontal air tubes,
was placed an inverted bell shaped casting. This
was also attached to the vertical shafting by a spider
casting thru which the threaded shaft screwed. The
shafting was screwed thru the capstan drum which
was anchored into a horizontal I-beam fastened to
the beams of the building. The apparatus was ar-
ranged in such a way that the lower head piece could
be raised when the upper head piece was lowered,
and vice versa, until the water flow space between
the castings is of the required capacity. The water
rushes thru the submerged tubes over the lower
casting and past the ends taking air with it. The
whole arrangement is duplicated on each shaft. Each
pair of head pieces could be regulated by simply turn-
ing the capstan bar. However, automatic regulation
was provided for. The lower-casting has bolted
to it a concentric tube so that the whole is but two
concentric cylindrical rings joined and closed at their
upper ends into one piece. From the interior of this
a small air pipe is set down thru the concrete lining
of the vertical shaft to the air compression chamber.
It was calculated that when the pressure exceeded a
certain maximum amount, the lower head piece would
be raised by sliding up on the steel shafting until the
pressure was relieved. However, as will be seen this
arrangement was not absolutely necessary as it proved
in operation.
The Operation
The operation of the plant was simply but ingeni-
ously planned. The water from the canal flowed
around and in between the head pieces drawing air
thru the pipes by its passage near their ends. The
total distance between water level in canal and
water level in compression chamber is 343 feet with
a theoretical fall of 72 feet and a vacuum of 271 feet.
When the water drops through the intake the veloc-
ity is increased during its passage and pressure is
reduced until an enormous vacuum is produced,
which sucks the air down with the water. At the
bottom of the shaft the concrete inverted cones
served to spread the water and to break the velocity
until the ends of the flaring tubes were submerged.
During the slower passage of water thru the hori-
zontal chamber the air bubles rise to the surface and
air separates out, and is compressed above the sur-
face of the water. The air pressure is kept at a value
such that the flared tube is always sealed from the
compressed air. When the pressure gets such that
the water level is lower than 14.6 ft. below the roof

of the chamber the blow-off outlet is unsealed, the
water and air rises in the pipe under pressure and
exhausts at the surface until the excess pressure is
relieved and the pipe again fills with water. The
blow-off occurs at 116 lbs. which pressure is obtained
from the 271 ft. head in outlet shaft and pressure
varies but one lb. at time of blow-off. The corn-
age caused. In the first case the head pieces were
being adjusted at high flow. The superintendant of
the Victoria mines has explained the cause of the
explosion and says that the flow of intake water was
cut off too quickly, so fast that the wave action in
the air chamber exposed the line of intake tubes at
the bottom of the shafts and let air escape up the shaft.

Vertical Section op the Taylor Hydraulic Air-Compressor
pressed air for use is tapped off in a 24 in. pipe from
which the air is taken off the mains to the different
parts of the mine. There is not much moisture left
in the air at 116 lb. What does remain is condensed
out in receiver tanks distributed on the mains.
In the 16 years of operation there has not been
any trouble or depreciation except by two explosions
causes of which have been fully accounted for. The
power of the plant was well indicated by the wreck-
The explosion had the terrific force to cut half of
the power house to pieces, bending I-beams in all
shapes and throwing the ten-ton upper head piece
castings thru the wreckage for a distance of sixty
feet. The men who had been setting the heads
narrowly escaped by a miracle, being in the small
undamaged part of the building. The second ex-
plosion was caused by ice freezing about the blow
off. As the upper head pieces had proven unneces-


Pajjc 17
MICHIGAN
TECHNIC

sary after the explosion they were not replaced and
the water now simply flows from the canal over the
edge of the lower casting. With the head piece out
it appears that more can enter the intake than be-
fore, thereby increasing the efficiency.
Capacity and Efficiency
The Plant provides power to run the hoists for
shafts, pumping and drilling machinery, stamp mill,
shops and locomotive. At the present reduced
operation the mine company uses about 1200 horse
power. The power not used goes to waste in the
blow-off. It is not necessary to use the flow in all
three intakes as present demand is about 1/4 of the
total capacity.
The theoretical free fall is 72 ft. but since the
descending water is filled with air bubles it is lighter
than the outflowing water and the intake column of
water is maintained higher than the elevation of the
outlet. The actual free fall is about 60 ft. or less.
This is the biggest factor in lowering the efficiency
of the plant. D. E. Woodbridge, mining engineer,
writes in the Engineering and Mining Journal that
the efficiency of the plant has been shown to be
827c in tests by Messrs. Sperr and Hood of the Col-
lege of Mines. He also notes that "for all practical
purposes it makes little difference in a plant of this
kind, whether the efficiency is more or less and per-
haps if it were not for the resistance of the air
bubles it would be even higher than recorded," and
that, "three shafts were built for the reason that they
give greater efficiency than one particularly during a
dry season."
The capacity of the air-compression chamber
above the water level is 80,264 cu- ft. No figures are
available on flow of water from canal. Mr. Wood-
bridge states in Engineering and Mining Journal
that the compressing capacity of the work is more
than 36,000 cu ft. of air per minute, and that the
compression may be overworked to the extent of
72.000 cu. ft. per minute for a period of 18 minutes
without causing a drop of pressure more than 5
pounds while delivering that double power capac-
ity.
The Cost
Building of the dams and canal was begun in
year 1901. Three years later the hydraulic com-
pressor construction was begun. In 1906 the pro-
ject was finished and connected up to operate all
machinery about the mine and a stamp mill which
had also been built near the plant at the same time.
The dams and canal cost $89,000. The compressor
and power connections cost $135,000. The mill cost
$30,000. Since the depreciation of the plant and
operation cost has been considered negligible in the
16 years of operation the plant has many times paid
for itself.
It seems that the landscape was molded for that
particular plant only. The whole development fits
into the natural scenery of the land without marring
it in the least. The spillway over the dam, the
canal winding around the hillside, and the frequent
spouting of the blow-off increases the beauty of the
scenery and attracts many sight seers. The blow-
off throws air-sprayed water a distance of 300 ft. in
the air with a roar that can be heard five miles away.
During low consumption of air the blow-off occurs
as often as every fifteen minutes.
It appears that the topography of the land is more
particularly adapted to this kind of hydraulic de-
velopment than to the hydroelectric development.
Due to the lay of the land it has succeeded with a
much higher efficiency than possible from the latter
type.
A Greater Electrical Power System
Southeastern Michigan light and power needs are
to be met through the operations of a great super
power system, now being developed by the Detroit
Edison company. Within another year it is expect-
ed to place in service a transmission line mounted
on steel towers, having a capacity of 110,000 volts.
This will carry the output of four large generating
plants and the electricity produced at dams along
the Huron river. The Huron de\elopement will be
augmented by two additional power plants, making
eleven in all, with a combined capacity of 5,000
kilowatts.
The plans being worked out by the Detroit
Edison company provide for connecting up with
the 110,000 volt line the electricity generated at
Connors Creek and Delray plants in Detroit, the
Marysville plant, which, it is expected will be com-
pleted in November and will have a capacity of
40,000 volts; the Trenton channel plant, yet to be
completed and the water power electricity. The
maximum load sent out over any line at present is
48,000 volts.
Consumption of electric current in the Detroit
district is an indication of the business trend.
During February 1922, the Detroit Edison company
sent out 76,845,500 kilowatt hours, an increase of
28.6 percent over the same month of 1921 and a de-
crease of 4.7 under the previous month. The total
k. w. h. consumption for January and February
1922 was 129.803.800. an increase of 27.9 percent
over the first two months of 1921. In February,
there were added 1.558 new electric customers.
The Detroit Edison company serves about 115
communities in counties of Wayne, St. Claire.
Lapeer, Oakland, Monroe, Washtenaw, Macomb
and Livingston.

Managing Engineer, Transformer Department
Fort Wayne Plant, G. E. Co.
Over 2000 years ago Archimedes made the fol-
lowing statement to Hiero, king of Sicily: "Give me
a fulcrum and I will raise the earth from its place,"
meaning of course, that by means of a lever he
could multiply the force which a single man would
be able to exert, to a great enough value to move
the earth from its path. Unfortunately the scien-
tific principles of the lever remained dormant until
about three centuries ago, when Galileo, the noted
Italian scientist, definitely formulated the mathe-
matical laws governing the principles of the lever.


Figurk I
Everyone, can realize that today the principles of
the lever are applied to practically every form of
mechanical motion, as well as to stationary struc-
tures, such as bridges, buildings, steel towers, etc.
In 1824, Michael Faraday made the startling dis-
covery that an electrical force, namely EMF, could
be multiplied by means of electromagnetic induc-
tion. This was really the birth of the present-day
alternating current device, the transformer, without
which the electrical industry would not have pro-
gressed as it has.
The transformer compares so perfectly with the
simple lever both in the static and dynamic condi-
tions that it may easily be termed the electrical
lever. For instance, in the simple lever, Fig. 1, the
force P, acts on the lever arm causing a force S,
whose magnitude is greater by the ratio of the dis-
tances PF/SF, and opposite in direction to the ap-
plied force. In the step up transformer shown in
Fig. 2, the induced EMF, Sj, is greater than the
impressed EMF P, by the ratio of turns 8,/Pj and
opposite in direction to the impressed EMF. This
comparison is taken with both transformer and lever
at equilibrium; that is, in the case of the lever,
where there is a resisting force R which balances
the force S resulting from the applied force P. Also,
the torque P times PF is equal to S times SF. In
the case of the transformer, the volts per turn of
the primary are equal to the volts per turn of the
secondary.
The analogy still holds true when power is being
transformed. In this case EMF, Fig. 2, corresponds
to mechanical force, Fig. 1; just as it did when both
were taken at equilibrium. Current, Fig. 2, will
correspond to velocity, Fig. 1, since current is the
rate of flow of electricity. In Fig. 1, when the re-
sisting force R is less than S, the end of the lever
arm will move upward, P moving downward, their
velocities being in the same ratio as their distances
from F. In Fig. 2, when R is reduced enough to
allow an appreciable value of current to flow, a cur-
rent flows in the circuit of the impressed EMF P„
being in the same ratio to current of circuit Sj as the
number of turns of each winding to each other.
Then the force P times its velocity or power input
of the lever would equal R times its velocity or
power output — considering the ideal case of no
losses. In the ideal transformer the power input
equals the power output; also, the volt ampere
turns of the primary equals volt amperes of the
secondary.
The fulcrum F of Fig 1 will correspond to the in-
terlinking magnetic flux of Fig. 2, since they are
&lt;3—


Figure 2
one of the essential parts of each machine, without
which, they cease to function. The fact that the
windings of the transformer are linked by the mag-
netic flux only, allows them to be thoroughly iso-
lated electrically by means of insulation, affording
a great advantage in the application of the appara-
tus when protection from the destructive high ten-
sion EMF's is required.
Just as an automobile is provided with extra gear
ratios to enable the engine to exert a greater torque

to Modern Warfare
By Major John A. Brooks, Jr.
Ordnance Department, U. S. Army
In the good old days of King Arthur and his
Knights of the Round Table, the Ordnance Depart-
ment does not appear to have been highly organ-
ized, except, ptrhaps, during the visit of Mark
Twain's Connecticut Yankee. Even then the rec-
ord is somewhat obscure as to whether the Yankee
should have been more properly called "Chief of
Ordnance" or "Director of Munitions."
In the days of Chivalry it is presumed that each
country blacksmith attempted to build up a reputa-
tion for the quality of his own product, as his suc-
cess in business depended upon his ability to sup-
ply helmets hard enough to protect the softest head
in the locality. He it was, who was able to supply
to all able-bodied men in the neighborhood all of-
fensive and defensive weapons that might be re-
quired.
But although the country storekeeper or the
blacksmith of yore found it necessary to keep in
stock or to be prepared to manufacture only a dozen
or two articles, the Ordnance Department of today
has listed in its catalog over 100,000 separate arti-
cles, thousands of which are for purely military
purposes and are not used or manufactured com-
mercially. No longer can men be found in each
neighborhood who are able to manufacture all wea-
pons needed for modern warfare, and in few com-
munities, prior to the war, could men be found who
had sufficient knowledge and equipment to manu-
facture any of the strictly military articles without
considerable delay.
Throughout the centuries, the main changes that
have taken place in the art of war have been due to
new inventions and discoveries in the field of Ord-
nance. The campaigns of Alexander the Great and
Hannibal, of Napoleon and of our troops in the
Civil War, are still used to illustrate the basic prin-
ciples of warfare; but changes in methods and in
detail are constantly made necessary by the devel-
opment of new types of ordnance. Most of these
new weapons have reduced the period of training
necessary for the men called upon to operate them.
It is easier to learn to shoot effectively with a mod-
ern rifle than with a bow and arrow; easier to learn
to fire a pistol than to wield a sword with adequate
skill.
Each new development, however, although it
tends to simplify the duties of the individual sol-
dier, adds to the education and training necessary
for the officer and non-commissioned officer, and
puts additional work upon the Ordnance Depart-
ment. Each individual cannot now select his own
weapons, and have them repaired by the nearest
blacksmith in case of breakage. The Ordnance De-
partment must design these weapons, each one of
which should approach perfection in effectiveness,
in safety, in simplicity of operation, and in econ-
omy and speed of manufacture and repair. It must
either manufacture or arrange for the manufacture
of these articles. It must arrange to inspect and
to test them, to store them until needed, and then
to issue them when and where needed without waste
of time. Arrangements must be made to repair this
material as needed, and without undue delay. Am-
munition, fire control equipment, and all of the other
accessories necessary for operation must be pro-
vided.
The Function of the Ordnance Department
The Technical Staff of the Ordnance Department
is continually developing and testing new types of
material, and improving existing types. New in-
ventions are daily being examined for military pos-
sibilities. The closest co-operation is being main-
tained with civilian manufacturers and engineers
through the Ordnance sections of the American So-
ciety of Mechanical Engineers, and the Society of
Automotive Engineers. The materials used, and
the technical design of ordnance material must be
of the highest type. Practically no new discoveries,
either of materials, processes or design, which are
of value to industry are not also of value to Ord-
nance; and, conversely, few developments in Ord-
nance are not of value to industry in general.
Each month brings new evidence of the results
of this tendency toward constant improvement.
Only recently have 14" shot been so perfected that
they can be fired thru 14" armor plate at a range of
10,000 yards, and at an angle of 25 degrees from

the perpendicular, without being broken or dam-
aged to such an extent that they will not detonate
after passing thru the plate. Powder has now been
developed which is not only smokeless, but also
flashless. When fired at night there is no illumin-
ation, whereas with ordinary smokeless powder the
flash can be seen for miles.
All new and experimental devices are tested at
the Ordnance Proving Ground at Aberdeen, Mary-
land. All newly manufactured articles of approved
design are also tested, or "proved," such, for in-
stance, as guns, carriages, samples of powder, shells,
cartridge cases, fuses, etc. Nothing must be ac-
cepted and issued to the Service until it is entirely
satisfactory. Frequently the entire product of a
good sized plant for months is tested by some young
officer in the course of the day's work, and the ac-
ceptance or rejection of the material rests upon the
result of the test.
The manufacturing service of the Ordnance De-
partment is engaged in the construction of this new
material, and also of other material which may be
required for current use. This includes all guns
from the 45-caliber pistol to the new 16-inch guns
with a range of 30 miles, together with the ammu-
nition, spare parts and accessories. It also includes
tanks, tractors, mobile machine shops, gun mounts
on caterpillar tracks, grenades, aeroplane bombs,
trench mortars, and similar equipment.
The Field Service is storing surplus material,
supplying troops, and planning methods of supply
and maintenance in time of war.
Preparation is an Insurance Against War
At the beginning of the war, the commissioned
personnel of the Ordnance Department numbered
97 officers. At the end of the war there were more
than 6,000, and more were needed. The number of
men engaged in Ordnance work had reached up
into the millions. There was hardly a community
in the country where some work for the Ordnance
Department was not being done.
This tremendous expansion was handicapped by
the lack of a comprehensive plan for industrial
mobilization, and by a shortage of trained officers.
No matter how willing a manufacturer may be, he
cannot, at short notice, turn out guns, or carriages,
or any other type of Ordnance materiel unless he is
prepared in advance. Methods have been worked
out so that each manufacturer can be prepared in
advance to manufacture that equipment for which
his plant is best adapted. But the completion of
such a comprehensive plan requires funds—only a
very small part of the funds which would of neces-
sity be wasted if no such plan were made. Funds
are appropriated only in response to favorable pub-
lic opinion, and public opinion is only the combined
opinions of individuals. If the people want it, the
Ordnance Department is prepared to complete the
task. Even though a country can raise 5,000,000
men in a month, and train them in three months, it
is weak unless it can properly equip an adequate
number before a foreign country can execute any
hostile move of military importance. But a coun-
try which is able to raise men as required, arm
them as soon as raised, and keep them supplied at
all times with the latest developments in Ordnance
materiel, will probably have no occasion to test its
resources. This result can be accomplished by
making thorough plans for industrial as well as for
military mobilization, and by having a reserve of
officers trained not only along miTitary but also
along engineering and manufacturing lines in order
that they may understand industrial problems and
thus co-operate more effectively with manufactur-
ers.
Arrangements have already been made whereby
a suitable number of qualified Ordnance Officers
may be secured. Ordnance units of the R.O.T.C.
in eight of our leading universities, including the
University of Michigan, furnish the means by which,
an engineering student, with very little effort, may
secure a commission in the Ordnance Officers Re-
serve Corps. The work is designed so as to form,
a connecting link between his technical training and .
Ordnance work. In preparing himself for anv
branch of the Reserve Corps, a man becomes not
only a better citizen, but his increased vision and
experience make him of more value to his employer
or organization and therefore to himself. If the re-'
suits of this work are as satisfactory as preliminary
returns would lead us to expect, we will have add-
ed a large policy to our insurance against war.
THE ELECTRIC LEVER
(Contnued from Page 18)
at the driving wheels to overcome great resistances
such as sandy roads, etc., an electrical transmission
line is provided with transformers to enable the
generators to impress a greater electromotive force
on the line to overcome the resistance of the con-
ductors. The most important application of elec-
tric current at high potentials is in the long distance
transmission of electrical power. It is the alternat-
ing current transformer that has made, this econom-
ically possible. If all the power that is transmitted
today at high voltages by means of transformers
was to be transmitted without the use of transform-
ers—assuming 600 Volts D.C.—there would not be
enough copper in the whole world to construct the
lines for carrying the power at this voltage from
the generating station to the consumer.

Associate Professor of Physiographical Geology
A comparison of the drainage conditions of dif-
ferent parts of our country which have similar cli-
matic conditions discloses a very striking contrast.
In the humid sections, the land is for the most part
perfectly drained, and an arborescent pattern
characterizes the streams which have been control-
led in their development by the slopes. However,
in the northeastern part much of the area is covered
by lakes and swamps, and the streams are so ir-
regular in pattern that the term haphazard has been
applied to them. The great number of lake basins
in this region is due to the great glacier of contin-
ental dimensions which invaded this part of the

An Ideal Shore Condition
country from the northeast in the geological yester-
day. The lakes lie in depressions scoured out by the
ice or in basins peculiar to the topography and dis-
tribution of the glacial deposits. These lakes, which
number more than five thousand, range in size from
areas of 31 square miles down to small ponds and are
estimated to cover one fiftieth of the area of the
State. Furthermore, they are well distributed
throughout the State. Are such lakes an asset or a
liability? If an asset, what purpose shall they
serve?
Are Inland Lakes Assets
The economic value of large lakes, such as the
Great Lakes, as highways of commerce and as
sources of food and water supply is well known,
but difficulty is encountered in applying the same
factors to the smaller inland lakes. As a source of
food supply such lakes have little significance, the
greater part of the fishing being for sport. As direct
highways they also are of little significance. On a
few of the lakes regular lines of transportation are
maintained during the summer months, e. g. on the
Inland Route including Crooked, Burt and Mullett
Lakes, and on Pine Lake, but this industry has de-
clined in the past decade. Yet, a number of the
lakes along the Lake Michigan coast which are
wholly or in part isolated from the big lake by sand
bars make excellent harbors and have warranted
the expenditure of millions of dollars in their im-
provement by the Federal Government. Among the
lakes which in this way serve as important links in
the waterways may be mentioned Black, Spring,
Muskegon, White, Pere Marquette and Pine Lakes,
upon which are located one or more cities.
As a source of municipal water supply the in-
land lakes are important and will assume a greater
importance in the future. Their use for this pur-
pose, however, is becoming more and more compli-
cated with the influx of summer visitors whose
number is increasing rapidly with the general use of
the automobile and the improvement of the roads.
But there are other and more important uses for
these lakes and these are determined to some extent
by one's view-point. Thus, the agriculturalist, de-
siring to add to his acreage land easily tilled, and
of high fertility, becomes interested in drainage
projects. In some cases drainage is not only feasible
but justifiable, but many problems such as increased
danger of floods, lowering of the water table, etc.,
are involved. Frequently such a procedure is in
direct opposition to another logical project and con-
troversy results. For instance, an engineer may
have shown the possibility of successful develop-
ment of power from the outflow of a lake. In this
case it is probable that the outlet must be dammed
in order to control the outflow and the lake will be
flooded for at least a part of the year. On the other
hand the capitalist may greatly disturb the natural
conditions in utilizing the lake deposits and, thus,
make the lake unfit for other purposes.
The few cases just mentioned will suffice to show
the varied uses of our small lakes and aso the con-
(

flicting interests involved. In each case a disturb-
ance of the natural conditions seems essential to the
project. It remains to call attention to another use
of lakes which may appear on first thought to smack
less of the practical but, nevertheless, from the view-
point of business is of great signifiance. We refer
to their use as summer resorts. It has been esti-
mated that the almost unbelievable sum of $100,-
000,000 is brought into the State annually by tour-
ists and a large part of this is spent at the inland
lakes.
A Geological Study of Inland Lakes
In general, a geological study of a lake is an at-
tempt to decipher its life history. The first problem
in the natural sequence is the origin of the basin, or
its birth. Then follows the development of the
basin by various agents and finally its extinction, or
death, for lakes are relatively short lived.
The origin of the basin, while of scientific import-
ance has less practical bearing than the development
of the basin which is brought about by waves, cur-
rents, and ice. These agents are effective primarily
on or near the shore and cause decided changes in
many cases. The waves attack the exposed parts
of the shore and quarry the material which at the
same time is being reduced to small fragments. The
latter are then removed by the currents and deposit-
ed in the more protected parts of the shore and on
the bottom off-shore, forming clean sand beaches.
Thus, certain parts of the shore are receding and
others being built out, tending to make the contour
more regular. Often this process is hastened by the
building of sand bars across the mouths of indenta-
tions. At the same time material is being carried
out into the lake but is deposited relatively near the
shore, forming a gentle off-shore slope of sand which
drops into deep water suddenly. The waves and
currents are mutually dependent and are most active
in the early stages of the development of the shore.
Ice is also a very effective agent on some lakes. Its
work is largely transportation and this is accom-
plished either by the expansion of the ice cover of
the lake during the winter or ice jams which are
blown on the shore in the spring. In either case
the force is great and the material, often of large
size, (see view of the shore of Long Lake), is forced
shoreward, eventually coming to rest in a rampart
along the shore.
The extinction of a lake is brought about by
many factors the most important of which for Mich-
igan lakes is filling. This may be due to the sedi-
ment brought in by entering streams, but organic
deposits are generally of greater signifiance for
smaller lakes. Under this class may be mentioned
marl and peat.
This natural sequence has been interrupted in
numerous cases, the chief interruptions being the def-
inite changes in water level. A rise in the level floods
the old shores and renews the activity of the shore
agents, initiating a new cycle of development. On
the other hand, a lowering of the level exposes the
old shores and starts a cycle of development that is
very different in its effects than that in the case of
flooding. Such changes are of great importance
from many viewpoints and in order to appreciate
their signifiance a knowledge of the action of the
shore agents is essential.

A ViEw of the Shore of Long Lake
If a study of ground water conditions and climate
be added to that of the geological history of the
lake, the best type of recreation is obtained, the
work itself is of absorbing interest, and material is
at hand which is invaluable to all concerned.
The Value of Lakes as Summer Resorts
From a study of Michigan's inland lakes it has
been learned that practically all have stood at one
or more higher levels in the past. This is fortunate
from the standpoint of lakes as recreational centers
for it provides ideal shore conditions, see view of
Pittsburgh Landing, Burt Lake, situated on an ex-
posed terrace. Another factor which adds to the
popularity of our lakes is that many are located near
the Great Lakes which have a temperating effect on
the climate, giving moderate temperatures in sum-
mer. This is especially true of the lakes along the
Lake Michigan coast because the winds are prevail-
ingly from the west.
It is not the purpose of this article to undertake a
complete discussion of the value of the lakes from
all points of view but merely to call attention to the
varied and often conflicting ways in which thev
may be used. Lakes vary in their adaptability for
different purposes and each becomes, then, a poten-
tial problem. In the solution of such problems it is
felt that a study of the geology of the lake should


Page 23

TECHNIC

be included and the scope and advantages of such a
study have been sketched.
Michigan is indeed fortunate in her inland lakes
and should utilize them as efficiently as possible.
The writer's study of our lakes has convinced him
that most of them are adapted primarily for resort
purposes. This has already assumed large pro-
portions from the standpoint of business and is in-
creasing. The lakes already developed are visited
by greater numbers each year and new lakes are be-
ing made accessible by the improvement of the
roads. It seems logical, therefore, to urge that a
careful survey of all the possibilities of lakes be
made before deciding on the form of utilization and
that in this survey emphasis be placed on the future
requirements as recreational centers.
THE HUMANISM OF ENGINEERING
(Continued from Page 7)
ing others by the time honored method of hard
knocks, through main strength (of will) and
awkwardness (of ignorance).
To sum up, what are the best of the engineer's
qualifications in the broader field of humanism?
We must recognise first that he is neither a
necromancer of science nor a purveyor of art (with
apologies to our architectural brothers), but a
disciple of technology which is quite a different
matter; a compromise, if you will, between the
other two. His technical training has developed
accuracy, has supplied his one enthusiasm his love
of system, has drilled him in logical procedure, and
made him a dealer in facts. Above all these, and
fundamentally because of them, rises the engineer's
superior standard of honesty and honor. Right
there lies the kernel of his indisputable advantage
over his less fortunate associates from the practical
school. For after all, we are told, "each man has
his own standard of honesty; and there are many
kinds of honesty and many standards of honesty".
We know honored men of business who have just
managed to keep out of jail; we know lawyers who
make an honest and enviable income by honestly
circumventing the laws of the land; we know
doctors who accept fees for failures; yes, and
engineers of a kind, who "build roads for fifty years
that disappear in two", but your "real engineer" is
a man of unimpeachable integrity.
Considering now the engineer as a class, taken by
and large, and disregarding the shining exceptions
in the profession who but prove the rule, what does
he lack? First, knowledge of human nature, the
art and technique of handling men, in fine,
practical psychology. He lacks the other enthus-
iasms besides the one credited to him above. He
lacks imagination, except perhaps that technical
imagination which we must grant him who has
successfully and credibly survived descriptive
geometry and theory of stresses; it is to that type
of imaginative ability, of course, that we owe the
Brooklyn bridge. But the other brand, the one
which conceives a nebulous enterprise and with a
clove hitch on that star, hand over hand brings it
home in a blaze of human blessings, that he lacks.
He lacks a fundamental knowledge of economics
and of finance, so essential if he would mould
human endeavor, or even assume his rightful place
in industry.
The engineer leaves school with his education
only begun. He has heard that bromide before.
And it is true. Just how true and just how narrow
has been his education to that point no one can tell
him. He comes to that knowledge with the years.
Expressed mathematically this proportion may
help.
S &amp; R: the engineer :: multiplication table : the
banker, wherein we may consider that there is as
long a step in the first ratio as in the second. An
eminent engineer, a past president of the American
Society of Civil Engineers, once made the state-
ment in an address before that society (to quote
from memory) that an engineer's career is divided
into three periods: the first thirty years, a period
of education; the second thirty years, a period of
training wherein he rounds out and supplements his
education and becomes proficient in the technique
of his profession; and the third period, after attain-
ing the mature stature of sixty years, he may
devote to the practice of engineering without
presuming on the confidence of his clients.
Choose a Broader Academic Training
The author of "Nescience of Engineering" said
that after completing his engineering course the
engineer "must acquire a liberal knowledge of the
sciences and arts,. ... of the basis principles of
law,, .... also of the principles of practical
gambling", (for, indeed, the truly balanced
engineer must possess a delicate blending of
nrudence and recklessness), to all of which I
heartily subscribe, only 1 would amplify the list
with special emphasis on psychology, economics,
and accounting. Choose your electives from the
fundamentals in those subjects, put the same
intensive application into your study of them as you
did on thermodynamics, and you will never regret
it. To supply the lack of imagination and
enthusiasm our engineer again must delve into the
realm of literature and art. He must make of him-
self truly an all round man. Here is what a hard


May, 1922
MICHIGAN
TECH NIC

headed manufacturer tells us in his bid for broad
gauge technical men. "The all round man is better
equipped to deal with men, by reason of a wider
knowledge of humanity, and broader sympathies.
The "humane" studies train the brain to function as
a thinking machine, and especially, they stimulate
that creative gift of the mind called imagination".
This idea of broadening the engineer's academic
training is of course not new. It was long ago
recognized in other professions, and to matriculate
in a school of law or medicine of any standing one
must have an A B degree. My own Professor of
Civil Engineering never passed an opportunity to
express his favorable opinion of such an extension
of the courses in engineering, as have certain other
educators from time to time since then, and while
some of us may one time have looked upon six years
as an interminable period, we have since come to
realize the brief span it represents. It must be
remembered also that in those days our tree of
sturdy branches had not yet acquired the myriad
twigs and shoots that make its top so feathery
today, and yet we, and your professors also, spent
the same period of technical training in the
fundamentals that you do now in the several
specialties. Charles E. Green, the late Dean of the
Engineering College at Michigan once said that the
then simple selection of a branch of engineering was
of little importance if the real fundamentals were
regarded in their true proportion, and provided one
pursued his natural bent; and he cited the un-
exceptional incident of one of his graduates in civil
engineering who was then engaged in Egypt
installing power machinery for one of our
mechanical industries. Many of us have had to
acquire a working knowledge of other branches in
engineering than that in which we graduated to
be able to formulate and direct necessary work of
that character.
Psycology Aids Understanding of Human Nature
Finally, what are the individual's responsibilities
in the matter under discussion? Socrates declared
that a man took the first step toward knowledge
when he recognized the fact that he knew nothing,
and the second, only when he undertook to study
himself. For some strange reason it seems easier
for most of us to know our friends and acquaint-
ances than to become acquainted with ourselves.
He who would become proficient in dealing with
other men, however, must first know himself, and
then must set out in earnest to correct his defects.
John D. Rockefeller's unparalleled rise to power
during a period of generally unscrupulous business
operations has been attributed to his perfect self
control and invulnerable poise. Having these, one
possesses self confidence; and this is not the brand
that requires loud voiced officious advertising,
more correctly called egotism. The truly self
confident energetic man wastes few words, and has
such command of himself that he produces results
without apparent effort. Possessing such qualities
and having combined with them a will which can-
not be confused with bulldozing or stubbornness,
and a sincerity of the word-as-good-as-his-bond
variety, he radiates personality. Personality is
his personal equation, which has been admirably
defined as "that something in a man that makes
him effective in managing other men". Here it is
well to invite attention to the fallacy entertained
by some that personality means the ability to
bellow commands like the clipper ship master of
old, or, like the "top kick", to "bawl out" the
unfortunates who chance to be at his command, to
cow them with billows of vibrant atmosphere.
How interesting to discover that such is not the
case; the man of effective personality is neither
garrulous nor blustering, but as a rule a good
listener with an open mind, and a man of action
without seeming haste. All this leads us back to
the effort of the individual to mould the human
forces of nature, and the value of applied
psychology in this endeavor. An authority claims
that "one cannot acquire a thorough understanding
of human nature, of how to influence and manage
men, without becoming acquainted with the
principles that have been worked out through the
science of psychology".
First Impressions Based on Personal Appearance
Having solved his personal equation, the
engineer next finds some rough and ready exteriors
to be carefully considered in his approach to and
maintenance of contact with human kind. A
former professor in the Engineering College at
Michigan was accustomed to use one lecture hour
each semester in which to admonish his students
on the subject of deportment and dress, and the
incident he related of an engineering graduate who
forfeited a splendid commission and a brilliant
opportunity because he did not handle his fork
properly at luncheon with his prospective employer,
has a moral. The first impression is usually one
of appearance, and in that fact is food for thought
particularly among the civils whose work in the
field or on the job is so often akin to "roughing it."
The "roughing it" is of course a splendid thing,
clothes and all; but prudence would counsel a new
toilet when one is off the job or around the hotel.
King (St.) Louis of France at the time of his
Crusade in the I3th. century was once led by a
controversy among his knights to speak in this


Page 25

wise: "You ought to clothe yourself well and suit-
ably, so that your wives may love you the better,
and your people hold you in the greater honor.
For, as the sage tells us, our garments should be of
such fashion as neither to cause the aged and
worthy to say that too much has been spent upon
them, nor the young to say that too little has been
been spent."
Learn to Talk Effectively
Most important of all, however, to the engineer,
and the most notable failing displayed by him in
public, (once more disregarding the exceptions) is
an ability to express himself. He surely cannot
go far toward shaping to the uses of man that
human source of power in nature if he is unable to
impress his ideas upon the intelligence of human
beings. To do this he must accomplish two things:
learn the English language (which should not be
confused with "slanguage"), and learn to talk on
his feet. There are, no doubt, a few rare specimens
of the race who have never experienced a qualm or
shaking knees, but there is good reason to believe
that from school boys up, timidity before an
audience is a common trait in human nature. The
only remedy is to get up and say something.
Confidence born of escape from bodily harm after
the first attempt does much as a tonic, and the will
to persevere does the rest. That is the real value of
your engineering societies to the undergraduate.
If you are not privileged as an officer to hold the
focus of attention most of the time, exercise your
right of membership, like the lone citizen at a city
council meeting, and tell them how it ought to be
done. We are told that the late Theodore Roosevelt
was so diffident as a young man that he could not
recite in his classes at Harvard without embarrass-
ment. Following the advice of President Elliot to
get on his feet at every opportunity, have something
to say and say it, he eventually overcome that
natural tendency, and there are few in this land
who now remember Theodore Roosevelt as timid.
Granting, then, in conclusion that, born human,
the engineer is capable of sympathetic accord with
the rest of the human family, he will first
acknowledge, with reservations, the indictment by
men in all lines of endeavor including men of his
own profession, on one count at least: that of not
having broadly fitted himself for the wider field
which is by right his: the moulding of that
mightiest source of power in nature, man himself,
for the utmost ultimate benefit of society. This
acknowledged, he will admit of every possibility of
attaining the sphere of influence awaiting him,
provided the right individual development and
professional enlargement is sought, and expect in
the future less specialization in his earlier prepar-
ations, and greater generalization, to that end.

Do You Recognize the Campus from This Angle?


By Clarence W. Hubbell. '93E
City Engineer
Detroit is spending more than $1,000,000.00 a
month for the construction of sewers.
In 1915 the area of Detroit was 42 square miles,
and the population 750,000. In the last five years
the area has been more than doubled, it being at
present 85 square miles and the population about
1,100,000. In 1915 the sewer system was adequate
for about 30 square miles with a population of 500,~
000. The sewers were designed for both storm and
sanitary sewage combined, with the result that
with every severe rain, basements were flooded
throughout practically the entire area of the city.
This involuntary use of basements for sewage stor-
age basins, resulted in the loss of much property as
well as creation of extremely unsanitary health con-
ditions.
System Designed to Meet Future Requirements
In 1917 the City Engineer prepared plans for a
comprehensive system of trunk sewers. This
system was designed, not only to relieve the exist-
ing conditions, but to care for the additional 40
square miles of annexed and rapidly developing
territory. These general plans were submitted to
and approved by a special sewer commission con-
sisting of three prominent engineers and two able

Trunk Line Sewer Under Constriction
contractors. The system was designed to meet the
future requirements of a population of approximate-
ly 2,600,000, which it is estimated, will be reached
about 1950. The designs were based on local rain-
fall observations extending over a period of 20
years, supplemented by short time observations
made at four gauging points throughout the city
for the purpose of studying the extent of local
thunder storms of high intensity. Computations
of capacity were made on the basis of the Rational
Formula. The system was also designed to pro-
vide for the construction of future interceptors and
treating plants to meet with the requirements of the
International Joint Commission with reference to
the pollution of boundary waters.
At the present time all sewage is discharged with-
out treatment into the Detroit River which has a
flow of about 210,000 C. F. S. The requirement to
be met is that the pollution of this stream shall not
exceed an average of 5 B. Coli per 100 C. C. This
requirement is interpreted to mean that the bacteria
reduction in raw sewage must be approximately
95%.
The total cost of the project provided for immedi-
ate construction, will be approximately $40,000,-
000.00. This amount does not cover treating plants
or interceptors, which will cost some $7,000,000.00
more for immediate construction.
The War conditions, high price in material, and
scarcity of labor, prevented construction on a large
scale until 1920, although a small amount of pre-
liminary work was done in 1919. At the present
time the project is about one half completed. The
third quarter of the work is under contract and will
be completed during the current year.
Natural Drainage Lines are Followed
In general the trunk lines follow natural drain-
age lines. The largest trunk line is known as the
"Connors Creek Sewer" which drains about 31
square miles. This sewer consists of three box sec-
tion barrels, each barrel beng 15ft. 9m. x 17ft. 6in. in
size. It is built of reinforced concrete in open cut.
Where not confined by sheet piling, on account of
adjacent buildings, the cut is 80 feet wide on top,
54 feet wide on the bottom, about 24 feet deep, the
excavation is made with steam shovel and drag
line, and the concrete is poured from a tower which
follows the construction. Twenty feet of sewer is
completed each day. Each lineal foot requires 63
cubic yards of excavation, 11 cubic yards of con-
crete, 1,116 pounds of reinforcing steel.
The major portion of the sewers are constructed
(26)

in tunnel of circular section, the largest being 14
feet inside diameter. The material consists of blue
clay, varying in consistency from soft putty to very
hard material approaching shale. Occasional quick
sand pockets are encountered in certain portions of
the work. Great advances have been made in the
.method of tunneling adopted on various portions of
this work. Air pressure has been required on four
of the contracts. The crown plate method of

CONNOR'S CREEK SEWER
supporting the roof in bad ground has been success-
fully employed. Tunneling machines have been
perfected which do the work of 40 or 50 men. The
largest section tunneled by a machine was 14 ft.
3 in. outside diameter. An average progress of 20
feet per day was made in this size bore on each
heading where conditions were favorable. Some
contractors, however, prefer pneumatic spades,
which have been very successful. On one job the
installation of pneumatic spades to replace hand
labor with pick and shovel, resulted in the saving
of from $25.00 to $30.00 per foot. Still other con-
tractors prefer the power knife which is a "U"
shaped cutting tool operated by means of cable and
electric drum. This device is usually supplemented
by pneumatic spades for trimming and for excavat-
ing a pilot tunnel in advance of the main excavation.
This pilot tunnel is necessary in order to facilitate
the use of the power knives. The material used in
tunnel lining consists of brick, monolithic concrete,
and concrete blocks. The use of concrete blocks
has been abandoned by contractors because of the
difficulty and cost of manufacturing and placing
the blocks. The largest blocks used were about 4!^
feet long, 30 inches wide 16 inches thick, and were
handled by hydraulic erectors. The use of shields,
attempted in two instances by contractors, was,
however, abandoned on account of the difficulty of
jacking them ahead against the lining in material
of the nature encountered.
A general survey shows that a great development
has been made in the last few vears in Detroit's
sewer construction work. The tunneling machine,
which does the work of forty men, is only a single
example of the improvements brought about. This
development is the result of the renewed activity in
drainage construction since the war. An idea of the
magnitude of the work being carried out may be
had by considering that more money has been
spent during the calendar year 1921 than during the
previous seventy years.
THE LIFE WORK OF CORNELIUS DONOVAN
(Continued from Page 8)
'Phis, to most men under such circumstances, would
have meant the taking of an office at the head-
quarters at New Orleans. Instead, in order to be in
close contact with his work, for twenty three years
Mr. Donovan sacrificed the comforts of a city and
lived in a houseboat on the mosquito-infested river.
And he was successful. Within a short time he was
maintaining the desired depth along the entire
canal.
One would be apt to imagine that living the life
that he did, he would become of the type of which
we hear so much today; just an engineer. He was
quite the opposite. The reading of books of every
description was his hobby. Dean Cooley has de-
scribed him by saying that it was an education
merely to converse with him on vital topics. After
a two weeks visit with him .Profesor Davis wrote
the following: "He is a modest, unassuming gentle-
man of the finest personal appearance, bearing, and
manners. Socially, he makes friends immediately
with the best of people."
The War Department now saw that a channel to
the gulf was possible; it was not satisfied, and de-
cided that a much more efficient channel, through
the large South-\Vest pass, was needed. Although
Mr. Donovan was maintaining the desired depth in
the present channel, it was with great difficulty.
Therefore the War Department wanted a new,
more permanent, canal. A committee composed of
two army engineers and two civilian engineers
drew up plans for the proposed operations. So
great was the confidence in Mr. Donovan's ability,
that when the plans were up for approval, they
asked him his ideas.on the subject; he presented
his plans, and those of the committee were laid
aside and he was placed in charge of the project
immediately. During his work at the South West
Pass he resided at New Orleans. The work was a
complete success, and the South West Pass was
opened to shipping in the winter of 1911.
The death of Mr. Donovan terminates a career of
forty five years of service to his country.


COLLEGE NOTES


EDITED BY DONALD A. HOLM
Engineering College Head Retires
Assistant Dean William H. Butts Resigns
After Forty-One Years of Service
The resignation of Assistant Dean William H.
Butts deprives the engineering college of one of its
most successful educators. During the fourteen
years that Dean Butts has been connected with the
college in the capacity of Assistant Dean he has
won for himself a permanent place in the hearts of
the engineering students. Perhaps at times the
occasion has demanded that he be a bit stern, but
this sterness was only a mask used to conceal his natur-
ally jolly disposition. Men who have come into con-
tact with him realize that whatever action Dean
Butts has taken has been primarily for their own
good, and have deemed to look to him as a second
father. His success in that role is due not only to
his preliminary training but chiefly to his 41 years
of association with students. This has served to
give him a keen understanding of college men.
Assistant Dean Butts was born in Harmony, N.
Y., February 16, 1857. In 1875 he entered the liter-
ary college of this University, where he received his
A. B. and A. M. degrees. The Dean ranked very
high scholastically and was elected to membership
in the honorary society of Phi Beta Kappa.
After receiving his degrees at the University,
Dean Butts served for fourteen years as principal
of the Michigan Military Academy at Orchard Lake.
It was during that time that he became actively
interested in organizing the North Central Associa-
tion of Colleges and Secondary Schools .Due prim-
arily to his efforts a motion was passed at a conven-
tion of the Michigan Schoolmaster's Club which lead
to the formation of the North Central Association.
This Association has developed into one of the
strongest agencies in the United States for maintain-
ing the high standards in college preparation.
Following the resignation of his position with the
Military Academy Dean Butts studied for several
years in Europe. Upon his return to this country
in the fall of 1898 he took up the position of in-
structor of mathematics in the literary college. Seven
years later he was promoted to the rank of assist-
ant professor of mathematics.
After some time Mr. Butts made another trip to
Europe. He secured the degree of Ph. D. in 1907
after studying one year in the University of Zurich,
Switzerland. In 1908 he was appointed assistant
dean of the engineering college with the full title of
associate professor of mathematics. For the past
three years Dean Butts has held the rank of profess-
or of mathematics.
Dean Butts has tendered his resignation upon
reaching the age limit for retirement on the Carnegie
Foundation. His generous nature is expressed in
his statement that he leaves because he wishes to
give encouragement to the younger members of the
faculty. "I do not favor 'dying in the harness',"
said Dean Butts during an interview, "but prefer to
listen to my obituary while still in good health."
After his resignation goes into effect the Dean is
planning to travel extensively in this country and in
Europe. He will devote much of his time in the
future to the developement of fads and fancies that
he could not indulge in while acting as advance
agent for the college of engineering, and regulating
the lives of two thousand young men.
"Dean Butts has been most successful in his 14
years service as assistant dean", said Dean Mortimer
E. Cooley. "He has been a valuable man and his
loss will be a serious blow to the department.

By C. P. Haller '22E and B. L. Beckwith '21E
During recent years a remarkable development
has been made in the design and application of the
low compression type of oil engine, because of the
low fuel costs and the small amount of attendance and
repairs necessary to keep these units in operation.
This type of engine has found a ready field of ap-
plication in installations requiring relatively small
isolated power units, such as mills pumping plants,
small electric generating plants, mines, etc. In gen-
eral there is not likely to be found any kind of power
requirements within their range which cannot be
met by these engines.
Following out the policy long fostered by our
Mechanical Department of equipping the laboratory
with at least one unit of each representative type of
prime mover, a 37-1/2 H. P. Fairbanks-Morse
Type 'Y', low compression oil engine was recently
installed. The engine is a vertical single cylinder
unit, operating on a two stroke cycle. Air is com-
pressed in the crank case, and is admitted to the
cylinder at the end of the working stroke at a pres-
sure of about 4 pounds. Fuel oil is injected into the
cylinder just before the end of the compression
stroke in a finely divided spray at a high pressure.
The finely divided oil mixes with the air and ignites
due to the temperature of compression and the re-
sidual heat in the cylinder and gases. The speed is
maintained at about 300 R. P. M. by varying the
fuel supply through a governor controlled by-pass
valve in the oil injection pipe. Starting is readily
accomplished by admitting compressed air to the
cylinder through a cam-operated valve. At starting
ignition is obtained by an externally heated nickle
bolt. High temperatures are avoided in this engine
by water-cooled jackets in the walls and head of the
cylinder.
Test of the Engine
A complete test of this engine to determine the
efficiency and economy of operation was carried out
by the squad of course M. E. 22 under the super-
vision of Professor Emswiler. The unit was run at
various loads measured by a Prony brake. Readings
were taken of the various exhaust and cooling water
temperatures, and the weights of fuel and cooling
water used were recorded. Indicator diagrams were
taken of the cycle in the cylinder and in the crank
case. Analyses of the exhaust gases were made
intermittently with the Orsat apparatus. The cool-
ing water outlet temperature was maintained con-
stant throughout the entire test at 1300 F. The fuel
used in the test was a good grade distillate, specfic
gravity .815 and having a higher heating value of
about 20,000 B. T. U. per pound.
Results of the Test
The results obtained from the test are shown
graphically in the diagram. The characteristic curves
show a relatively high efficiency and economy of

operation over a wide range of load. At full load,
namely 37-1/2 H. P. the best economy was obtained
Here the lowest fuel consumption of 0.533 lbs. per
B. H. P. per hour was reached. This is slightly
above the minimum claimed by the manufacturers,
but still well under the guarantee. The thermal
efficiency was maintained at about 23% and the
mechanical efficiency at about 89% throughout a
wide range of operating loads. An overload of about
10% was obtained with only a 1% drop in speed.
Corrosion and Rust-Proofing of Iron and Steel
Professor W. P. Wood
During the past two years an extensive corrosion
test has been carried out in the Chemical Engineer-
ing Laboratory, with a view of discovering the rel-
ative value of various ferrous products in resisting
corrosion and the efficacy of some commercial rust-
proofing processes in preventing corrosion. The
metals studied were wrought iron, open hearth steel,
open hearth iron, and copper steel. The rustproof-
ing processes considered were the sherardizing, cal-
orizing, galvanizing, Parkerizing, and Harris pure
zinc process. The latter is a modified electrolytic
process.
From the results obtained it is impossible to make
any general statement with regard to the relative
ability of any of the metals to resist corrosion. It
is a question of specific circumstances and condi-

tions—under some conditions one metal appears to
be superior—under other circumstances a different
metal shows up better. Actually, there appears to
be very little difference in corrosion rates of the
above mentioned metals under ordinary conditions,
when immersed in water. Of the rust-proofing; pro-
cesses, galvanizing still appears to be the best means
of preventing corrosion under water. It must be
understood that the corrosion is not absolutely pre-
vented; it is materially slowed up till the zinc coat-
ing deteriorates after which it proceeds at the usual
rate.
Paper From Bamboo
Y. M. Tse, '22E, has been conducting research
for the past year, on the manufacture of paper from
bamboo. The results have been quite successful,
several grades of strong paper having been made.
Bamboo is a cheap source of pulp. The sweet
bamboo is the cheapest and furnishes the best grade
of paper. It has practically no uses in China,
though it is sometimes used as food. In this case
only the young shoots are used. The plant has a
very rapid growth ; maturity being reached in about
three months, with a height of fifty to sixty feet
and a diameter of six to eight inches. It has been
found that the best pulp is made from trees which
are at least two years old. The flax bamboo can
be used, but it is not as cheap and does not give as
good a grade of paper.
Another tree, the Chinese fir, gives a better grade
of paper than some American spruces. It is a cheap
source of pulp as it has very few uses.
Contrary to common opinion, the sulfite process
was found to give the best results with bamboo.
The sweet bamboo gives 49% pulp ; the flax bamboo
29-30% and the Chinese fir 39-40%. The best
grades of pulp woods, give from 30 to 39% pulp.
This would seem to indicate that bamboo is a
practical source of paper.
From one grade of bamboo pulp, a very strong
parchment paper is made. Others form good wrap-
ping papers.
Proposed Changes in Drawing Curriculum
If the plans now approved by a committee com-
posed of the heads of the various departments of
the College of Engr. are accepted, the Freshmen
who enter the Engineering College next fall will be
confronted by a completely revised schedule in
Drawing.
Drawing courses 4 and 5, the "bugbear" of nearly
all Engineering students, were inaugurated into the
college curriculum in 1913 merely as an experiment.
They will now be combined in one three hour course
which will be taught during the second semester of
the Freshman year.
Drawing 1 will be taught during the first semes-
ter. This will be composed of the principles under-
lying the representation of objects by drawing,
lettering, use of instruments, etc.
The second semester will be taken up with the
"never to be forgotten" descriptive geometry course
which will give only three hours of credit. It is
thought that better results will be accomplished
than by the present method as the student will be
better acquainted .with the college work and more
able to visualize the difficult problems after having
finished the elemtary course, Drawing III.
Drawing 3 which will comprise drafting room
practice, sketching isometric and oblique projecton,
perspective and a small amount of machine drawing
will be taught during the first semester of the
Sophomore year. The courses for the several de-
partments will be slightly different and will begin
the study of the typical problems which the engineer
will have to meet in his professon.
Drawing 4, a continuation of course 3 will deal
with the principles of mechanism. This course will
be a foundation for the design courses of the vari-
ous departments.
The work will cover the analysis of mechanisms,
classification of the parts of machines and the
svnthesis of mechanisms.
Properties and Classification of Motor Fuels
The only satisfactory method of testing motor
fuels is to burn the fuel in an engine under very
carefully controlled conditions. A single cylinder
variable compression engine is now available for
the work in the automotive laboratory. A specially
constructed rapid gas analysis apparatus can be
used fpr exhaust gas analysis, and a small still and
column of special design is available for preparing
motor fuels.
'The work to be done covers the fractionation of
various types of gasoline to recover the pure hy-
drocarbons, the burning and testing of these pure
substances, among others, under varying conditions
of mixture proportions, mixture temperature, com-
pression pressure, etc., with the ultimate aim of
classification of the fuels on the basis of some sim-
ple test.
The Automotive Laboratory and the Chemical
Engineering Department are cooperating on this
work. The engine to be used was designed under
the supervision of Prof. Lay. The tests on the en-
gine will be carried out in the motor laboratory and
the work on the fuels will be done in the Chemical

AERIAL SURVEYING
(Continued from Page 10)
is also found in the real estate field. A firm putting
a new subdivision on the market desires to show
its location with respect to established buildings.
It can be seen that at times a distortion in the
picture may be desirable from the viewpoint of the
real estate dealer.
The excellent result attained by aerial photo-
graphy during the late war deserves especial con-
sideration. In this regard, it must be kept in mind
that France was well mapped before the war.
Relief is fairly constant, so that the aeroplane
camera was used chiefly as a re-survey instrument
for noting changes in culture, i. e., man-made
changes. The aeroplane method is essentially
applicable as a re-survey method for use in cases
where an accurate original survey is available for
furnishing control points and this is a field large
enough to justify the time and money already spent
in developing it. Where extensive changes in re-
lief have taken place, some of the older methods of
surveying must be used. In this country, the air
service and the Coast and Geodetic Survey and
Geological Survey have collaborated in an ex-
haustive series of experiments to find the use and
limitations of aeroplane surveying. Its use in re-
surveys offers great promise, but in hydrography,
with present equipment, the results have been dis-
appointing.
Further Development is Essential
As a net result of the experiments conducted so
far, it may be stated that aeroplane photography
is another tool of the surveyor but it is far from
being a surveying panacea. It is adapted to re-
surveys in comparatively flat, unwooded territory,
or as a reconnaissance survey in other instances.
At present the cost, as stated in the 1921 Report of
the Coast and Geodetic Survey, for the most favor-
able kind of aeroplane surveying is one-third the
cost of obtaining the same data with the plane-
table. It seems reasonable to assume that aero-
plane surveying will be developed much further but
it is an open question whether the cost will not
reach such a point that it cannot compete with
other methods.

Appearances
He turned solicitously from the wheel. "Don't
you feel a little chilly?" he tenderly inquired. Don't
you think you'd better have something around you?"
"'Well," she replied, "let's wait till we get a little
farther out in the country."
"Do you think I can make her happy?"
"Well, she'll always have something to laugh at."
"Professor, can a man live without brains?"
"Why, are you feeling unwell?"
Not Room Enough
"My good man, you had better take the trolley
car home." "Sh' no ushe! My wife wouldn't let
me-hic-keep it in the' house."
She—Do you know I find it so much colder out
here than it was back home. There I wore light
garments all winter, but since moving here I have
had to put on heavier clothing. I'm from Oregon,
you know.
He (with a polite show of interest)—Is that so?
I'm from Missouri.
Fairness to All
"Would you mind driving a little slower, my

Which will next year's
captain wear?
IT DOESN'T need much wisdom to predict that
next year's nine will be captained by a '23
man or maybe a '24 man.
This is no affront to underclassmen. Years of
steady plugging must go before you can handle the
man-sized responsibility of running a team.
That this is just, seniors will be the first to assert.
They have seen how well it works for team and col-
lege. Then let the seniors keep this point of view,
for soon they will find how closely the principle
applies to themselves in the business world.
Captains of industry are not made overnight.
Don't expect to step into a managership right
away. Before you can lead, you've got to serve
in the ranks awhile.
This is best for your organization and best for
you. The time and energy you put in working up
from the bottom, taking the bitter with the sweet,
getting the upperhand over your job, will stand
you in good stead when you have won through
to executive position.
When you have learned how to handle detail
work, you can begin intelligently to direct other
men to do it, and thus free yourself for creative
planning.
You who intend to be captains, have patience.
Your year will come and so will your chance.

Experience
Allis-Chalmers' engineering experience covering
more than sixty years devoted to the design and
building of heavy machinery for many varied engi-
neering and power purposes, includes prime movers
of all types, among which are some of the largest
units ever built, electrical apparatus and many com-
plete lines of industrial machinery.
By reason of this experience the Allis-Chalmers
Organization is able to propose and furnish equip-
ment best suited to meet the particular requirements
of its customers. With the complete equipment
built by one organization, under a single supervision,
the many details, complications and delays incident
to divided responsibility are avoided.

INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS SHOULD BE \V.-/r,
LIGHTED.
From the employer's viewpoint, the big difference
between men who work out of doors and those who per-
form tasks inside the building, is the factor of light. Day-
light furnishes sufficient illumination outside during the
daytime working hours for men to pursue their taslci
efficiently and safely. But the proposition of getting
enough daylight into the interior of industrial buildings,
requires some thought.
It is not a difficult problem by any means, and any
employer can take advantage of daylight and utilize it for
lighting his building during the daytime, if he desires. It
is an excellent light, especially suitable for the eyes, re-
ducing eye strain and eye weariness to a minimum, and
has the great economic advantage of costing nothing.
To utilize daylight to the utmost, we must first pro-
vide means for allowing daylight rays to enter the interior
of buildings in sufficient quantity—namely, proper and
adequate windows and skylights. Many excellent instances
of buildings designed with a due regard to the importance
of daylight lighting can now be seen in many of our in-
dustrial cities. Such buildings present the appearance of
being practically all windows—"window walled," as they
are termed—and this type of daylight construction is
coming rapidly into favor, because it constitutes a more
healthy building for large numbers of employes, both
from the lighting and ventilation standpoints.
Among those who have constructed this type of mod-
ern industrial building may be mentioned: The Shredded
Wheat Co., Gillette Safety Razor Co., Lyon &amp; Healy Piano
Co., H. J. Heinz Co., Corona Typewriter Co., Skinners
Macaroni Co., Grape Juice Co., Dodge Bros., Nelson Valve
Co., Piston Ring Co., Remington Arms Co., and a great
many others.
The Larkin Co., Philadelphia, has erected a building
almost entirely glass, 85% being windows, and the Loomis
Breaker, operated by the D. L. &amp; W. R. R. Co., Nanticoke,
Pa., is literally a glass house, being 93.5'' of glass. Th.3
new buildings of the Winchester Repeating Arms Co.
have an average glass area of 58%.
An investigation covering 18 buildings constructed by
the Aberthaw Const. Co., Boston, shows that the average
window area is 57.5%.
These figures indicate how important the subject of
lighting is now considered by employers of industrial
labor, and how well the idea has been carried out by the
architects and engineers, in order that all parts of a build-
ing may receive sufficient daylight. But, in addition to
providing ample window space, there is another factor
which is equally important, and that is, equipping the
.windows with the proper glass.
The bright direct rays of the sun should not be per-
mitted to strike the eye, and we must provide a means for
reducing the glare to rays which will not be too bright.
This is accomplished by glass especially manufactured for
industrial windows, known as Factrolite. This glass pos-
sesses the property of breaking up the intense rays of the
eun and diffusing the light into the interior of the build-
ing in proper portions, solving the problem of sun glare.
If you are interested in the distribution of light
through Factrolite, we will send you a copy of Laboratory
Report—"Factrolited."

FEDERAL JUNIOR
The Federal Jr. is, in itself, a complete receiving
set requiring nothing more than the aerial wires for its
operation. It is most ruggedly and simply constructed,
beautiful in appearance, simple in its operation and ab-
solutely reliable. No batteries or other source of power
is required for its operation, nor are replacements of
any kind ever required.
The FEDERAL Amplifier and detector units make possible
the most sensitive detector action and the greatest amplification with-
out critical adjustment and without the possibility of "howling."
The highly efficient and staple operation of these FEDERAL units
is brought about by the use of the universally famous FEDERAL
amplifying transformer; by their extremely careful construction and
by the thorough electrical shielding between successive stages of am-
plification. The tube, transformer, tube socket, telephone jack and
filament rheostat, constituting each stage of amplification, is enclosed
in its own grounded metal housing, and the parts of each stage and
their interconnections so arranged that magnetic or electrostatic fields
between successive stages, tending to produce "howling" and other
objectionable noises, are entirely eliminated.

UARADAY—the pioneer of trans-

TZ• UHLMAN—the modern express-
,*,*■ ion of transformer building.
npHE first transformer was constructed in
1831 by the immortal Faraday. The de-
sign of the first tarnsformer was necessarily
crude, but it embodied principles that are used
even now in transformer construction.
Transformers are today called upon to do
work that Faraday never conceived of. The
whole scheme of power transmission and dis-
tribution is based upon the premise that trans-
formers will perform their functions in an effi-
cient manner.
KUHLMAN TRANSFORMERS
represent the highest development of trans-
formers. They have embodied in them the
maximum degree of safety, reliability and
economy since the first KUHLMAN
TRANSFORMER was built in 1893. They
are designed to always be a step ahead of the
demands made upon them.
We will be pleased to send

Benjamin G. Lamme
VISITORS at the Chicago World's Fair, in
1893, saw the first extensive use of alternat-
ing current ever undertaken, when Westinghouse
lighted the entire grounds with this type of cur-
rent. This achievement marked the beginning of
thecommercialdevelopmentofalternatingcurrent
for power purposes, and brought the induction
motor into a prominence which it has never since
relinquished. Great and rapid have been the de-
velopments since that day, but the most impres-
sive aspect of this progress is not to be found in
the spectacular evidences that are visible to
everyone, but rather, in the vision and funda-
mental soundness and determination that have
been quietly at work blazing andclearingthetrails
which the electrical art has followed.
There is, for instance, the synchronous con-
verter. This machine is the most efficient and
economical means for changing alternating to
direct current, which the operation of most
street railway systems and many other processes
require. Without it, the development of alter-
nating current to its present universal usefulness
would have been tremendously retarded.
The synchronous converter, in its present per-
fection, is but one of the great contributions to
electrical progress that have been made by Ben-
jamin G. Lamme, Chief Engineer of the Westing-
house Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company. Mr.
Lamme, in 1891 when he was Chief Designer,
conceived and developed the converter, which,
first used commercially in connection with the
great Niagara power plan, has since come to be
indispensible to large producers of power.
When a man has played so vital a part in elec-
trical progress that his knowledge and vision
have contributed to practically every forward
engineering step, it is perhaps misleading to at-
tempt to identify him particularly with any one
development. His work on the induction motor,
the turbo generator, the single-phase railway
motor, and the synchronous converter is but
typical of the constructive ability which Mr.
Lamme has brought to bear on practically every
phase of electrical development.
A man of foresight, visioning the alternatives
in a problem as well as its hoped-for results. A
man whose mind combines great power of analy-
sis with the gift of imagination. Aprolifictechnical
writer, whose style is unequalled in clearness and
simplicity of expression. Few engineers so
thoroughly predetermine the results they actu-
ally achieve. Few men capitalize their experiences
so completely. And few indeed have at once his
thorough technical equipment, his commercial
understanding, and his broad human interests.
An institution which has builded its success
largely on engineering achievement pays Benja-
min G. Lamme affectionate loyalty and respect.
The young engineer on his first job, as well as the
most seasoned co-worker, finds in him under-
standing, sympathy, wise counsel, and a con-
science; to all of which his associates, in prepar-
ing this article, are proud to bear witness.

Yoij have gone to large expense in installing up-
to-date equipment in your plant, to insure econ-
omy in operation. How much of the potential
energy in your fuel are you actually utilizing in
producing steam?
Very much less than you could or should if your
boilers are hand fired!
Compare some of the advantages of Detroit "V"
Type Stokers over uneconomical hand firing!
A. Hand firing is intermittent, its evenness and effective-
ness depending upon the individual skill and atten-
tiveness of the fireman. With Detroit "V" Type
Stokers the human factor is eliminated; firing is continuous and uni-
formly even, assuring high combustion efficiency.
With hand firing, one fireman can at the best take care of 250 to 500
H. P. of boilers, whereas with Detroit Stokers the same man can handle
2000 to 3000 H. P. thus reducing labor costs 75 per cent.
C. Detroit "V" Type Stokers burn cheaper grades of fuel than can be
used to advantage with hand firing, thus paying for their cost several
times over each year.
In addition consider the advantages of control of air admission, thor-
ough automatic cleaning of fires,and smokeless operation, resulting
from a Detroit Stoker installation.
Detroit Stokers today represent the best fruits of a practical
knowledge gained in the Company's twenty years of successful
stoker building, and the recent important develop-
ments in the science of combustion. There is a
type for every purpose—"V" Type overfeed for nat-
ural draft—Single Retort Underfeed for boilers

means certainty in concrete pile formation. A spirally reinforced steel
shell is built up, to requisite length and taper, upon a driving core, or
mandrel. The mandrel drives the shell to resistance, and is then col-
lapsed and withdrawn, leaving the shell in the ground, its interior open
for inspection. The shell is then iilled with concrete, being left in the
ground to protect the "green" concrete pile column against distortion
nr other injury while "setting."
