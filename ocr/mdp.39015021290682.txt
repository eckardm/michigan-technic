ARE COLLEGE MEN WANTED?
By A. W. ARMSTRONG
IF the man recently out of college or technical
school is questioning, as seems to be the case,
whether he wants Big Business as a lifemate, like-
wise is Big Business question-
ing whether it has done alto-
gether well to take unto itself
the college man. These ques-
tionings on both sides are more
acutely to the fore during the
tirst year or two of the union
than ever afterward. lf the
union has not been dissolved at
the end of this time, it settles
down into a round of mutual
adjustments that work for the
fair average of content we find
in the domestic menage once
the turmoil of its beginning
has subsided.
In discussing the matter not
long since with a group of jun-
ior executives in a nationally known business or-
ganization, they told me that their chief executive
was so set against college men in general that when,
a short while before, it had seemed necessary to in-
clude a man of recent collegiate training among the
advisers the president was taking with him to
Europe to pass on some new proiect, they had de-
liberately selected from a number of applicants the
one they thought least likely to be detected as a
college man, and that only after he had won the
president's confidence had they dared reveal the
young man's background.
My own first serious thought on the objections
ONE of the severest tests of
character which our seniors
are annually called upon to face
is the transition from their status
in college to the niche they must
find in the industrial world. The
problem of getting ahead in their
work, and at the same time de-
veloping socially has taxed the
brain of many a technical gradu-
ate who has found adaptability
lacking from his virtues. We of-
fer this message from an exceed-
ingly well informed author in the
hope that it may stimulate some
hard thinking on this vital sub-
ject.
"THE EDITOR."
Big Business raises to the college man came when
the comptroller of the corporation with which I was
connected at the time, in outlining his needs for
"able fellows," capable of
working up to large responsi-
bilities, placed upon me the
final injunction: "But no more
college men—plea'se!"
As time went on, I heard
more and more often "No col-
lege men!" fro m executives
looking for young men to de-
velop in their respective fields.
What they wanted, if you
pinned them down, was high
school boys. And, except where
men with highly specialized
training are required, boys
with high-school education and
nothing more can, without
doubt, be more comfortably ab-
sorbed into the broad, slow-moving current of the
great corporation than can men with college train-
ing—and college aspirations.
Piut where is Big Business to find these high-
school graduates, energetic lads of first-rate intelli-
gence, who have in them the making of future busi-
ness leaders? When a lad of this sort finishes high
school nowadays he goes on to college, no matter
how poor his family, so much less have become the
difficulties of financing a college course, what with
scholarships, opportunities to work his way through
in whole or in part, and the ease of negotiating a
loan for the purpose. If he does go into business"

directly from high school, it is only for a year or
two, that his earnings may help toward the coveted
goal.
Rank has its privileges, Let Big Business speak
first.
Its outstanding criticism, when the frailties of the
college man have heen aired in my hearing, is of his
overweening desire to be advanced faster than his
own development and the exigencies of business
permit. Granting that in the long run the man with
collegiate training will, other things being equal.
have a decided advantage over the man without it,
from the executive standpoint, no educational train-
ing whatever offers an acceptable substitute for a
reasonable period of actual work in a business or-
ganization. A reasonable period. There's the rub!
In the mind of the college man it is a matter too
often of months—-a year or so at most. In the ex-
ecutive's mind it is from two or three years to six
or seven.
The college man, to be sure, has already spent
four to six years of what he considers the heyday
of his existence in some institution &lt;»f the higher
learning. Some thousands of dollars have been
spent to secure this training for him. He is eager
to realize on what amounts to a considerable invest-
ment. Afore often than not he is in debt for his col-
lege expenses. He is harassed by notes falling due
to a far greater extent than the upper executive—
long past a similar struggle, if he ever knew it—is
usually aware. I remember one fine young chap
who went through two severe winters without an
overcoat in his effort to pay back as rapidly as pos-
sible, out of his nominal starting salary, the man
who had financed him through college. Moreover,
he has developed tastes, entirely legitimate tastes,
that call for money—golf, his Ford, his college club.
His cultural side perhaps has been awakened; he
wants to hear the best music, to enjoy the theatre,
books, art.
And there are executives, though so rare as
hardly to count for purposes of argument, who con-
sider such tastes aids to the young man's business
progress. But the usual executive, who has taken
up golf at forty or fifty, even sixty, and whose en-
joyment of club life has been the reward of rather
than the prelude to his own business activities, does
not consider that an undue hardship is imposed on
the college man if he must postpone any large in-
dulgence of his sporting or social instincts until he
has, in the executive's opinion, earned a right to
do so.
Though the circumstances may be extenuating,
none the less the college man, from my observation,
does himself distinct harm during his initial period
in business by keeping his gaze constantly riveted
on what he is to get, rather than on what he is to
give. One of the well-founded charges against col-
lege men who enter Big Business is that they flock
together, form a clique; and, from what they them-
selves report, the all-absorbing and unending theme
of their conversation—at nte-al time, in their rooms
at night, and while they snatch smokes together
during business hours—is how much this one and
that is drawing, the sensational salary reported to
be paid somebody else with some other concern,
and their personal prospects in regard to increase.
However brutal the college man regards it. I be-
lieve the best bit of counsel that can be given him
is to forget for his first five years in business that
there is such a word in his vocabulary as "execu-
tive." His failure to use the term will not defeat
any secret hopes; and certainly in no other one wav
does he so prejudice his case as when he talks, and
often with the utmost sang-froid, of an executive
position for himself, talks of it as a certainty, and
to business superiors who may not yet have de-
termined whether they wish to retain him even in a
minor capacity.
Not a little, in fact, of the irritation Big Business
feels with the college man has to do with his man-
ners. Executives easily excuse crudeness in a man
who has come up from the ranks, but they are still
very generally filled with the notion that a college
education connotes gentility. The vast maiority of
executives of high rank of the present day did not
go to college; they tend in one and the same breath
to depreciate a college education and to exaggerate
the benefits it confers. They often appear unaware
that if a young man has not imbibed the elements
of good breeding in his own home he will not ac-
quire them at college.
While colleges do not attempt to teach manners
to the mannerless, more than one educator is all but
convinced that the student's future progress will be
to a great extent dependent upon them. The dean
of one of our oldest and most important schools of
business administration told me that after compar-
ing the business career with the college record of a
large number of men he was inclined to believe that
the two qualities that had more to do with business
success than any others were tact and initiative,
and of these he would give first place to tact.
If Big Business protests mainly against the col-
lege man's manners and his impatience to advance,
the college man's charges against Big Business are,
it must be admitted, far more numerous, if not
always so substantially founded.
The first jolt the college man receives is when he
finds he is no longer in college. During his college
career he has considered himself a rather free indi-
vidual, standing on his own feet. The truth is, he
has been tied to strong leading strings. Cut loose
from them, he flounders around in this new ele-

WHAT MAKES AN ENGINE KNOCK?
By GEO. GRANGER BROWN AND GEO. B. WATKINS
Department of Chemical Engineering, Uniwrsily of Michigan
SINCE 1905 the demand for gasoline has in-
creased faster than the increase in production of
petroleum. Accordingly the petroleum refiners have
resorted to the most obvious means of supplying
this increasing demand for their most volatile prod-
uct, that of including more of the less volatile ma-
terial in the gasoline fraction. The continuation of
this practice led to poorer engine performance and
particularly to a
very u n p 1 e a sant
"knock" in m o r e
efficient engines of
higher compression
ratio. This "knock"
is metallic in
sound, hut is not
due to mechanical
impacts, as was
first suggested.
The "knock" is
characterized by an
intense pressure of
extremely short
duration and a
marked decrease in
the power output
of the engine. The
reason for this de-
crease in power

spark to eliminate this objectionable sound, which
was then referred to as a "carbon knock." During
the war an intensive studv was made to find more
and better fuel suitable for use in the hierh com-
pression aeroplane engines. It was then found that
some fuels would "knock" more readily than other
fuels used under the same conditions. Accordingly
the "carbon knock" was rechristened the "fuel
knock," as it is now
known.
The startling dis-
covery a few years
ago that the addi-
tion of a small
amount of "dope"
to gasoline practi-
cally eliminated the
"fuel knock" shook
the petroleum re-
finers' firm convic-
tion that gasoline is

the piston by normal combustion, the maximum
power will be developed; if the explosion "knocks,"
a large part of the potential energy is spent in de-
veloping an intense momentary pressure which does
not persist long enough to do work or develop
power.
It was found that retarding the spark largely
eliminated this objectionable noise and the sug-
gestion was made that the "knock" was due to
pre-ignition. Further experience showed that the
removal of carbon from the surfaces of the com-
bustion chamber made it unnecessarv to retard the

Continued research on the "fuel knock" seemed
to indicate that the characteristics . of the "fuel
knock" were similar to those possessed by the "de-
tonation wave" set up in a progressive homogene-
ous explosion as occurs in long tubes, previously
discovered and investigated by Berthelot2, Le Cha-
telier3, and Dixon4. For this reason the fuel knock
is frequently referred to as "detonation," and some
investigatorsIi' 6 go so far as to assume that the fuel

knock is due to initiation of a true detonation wave
such as occurs in long tube explosions.
An inventory of our present knowledge indicates
that we know more about the engine knock than we
do about explosion in bombs. For example consider.
our knowledge of the effect of initial temperature.
Every observer of engine knock has reported that
an increase in temperature of the explosive mixture
increases the tendency of that mixture to cause en-
gine knock. This evidence is so conclusive that it
may be taken as a fact. Observers of explosions in
bombs do not agree as to the effect of initial tem-
perature. In a written discussion of the paper by
Woodbury, Lewis, and Canby, Dixon7 says: "If
the initial temperature of the gas is raised 100°C.
this rise is not added to the flame temperature." In
discussing some pressure time curves of the explo-
sions of petrol-air mixtures obtained by Penning at
the National Physical Laboratory, Ricardo8 says:
"An increase of 101 °C. in the initial temperature
means a similar increase in the flame temperature."
In order to settle this controversial point and to
determine the effect of initial conditions on bomb
explosions the apparatus shown in Figure 1 was de-
veloped. The apparatus consists essentially in an
explosion bomb equipped with the necessary optical
pressure indicator for obtaining the time pressure
curves, valves for charging the fuel and oxygen and
nitrogen, and gauges for indicating the conditions
of pressure and temperature before and after the
explosion. The entire set-up is contained in a spe-
cial dark room, Room 4227, East Engineering Build-
ing.
The results of experimental work conducted in
this bomb concerning the effect of initial tempera-
ture on the rate of rise of pressure of explosion
clearly indicate that an increase in initial tempera-
ture above 75°C. invariably causes a decrease in the
rate of rise of pressure and tends to eliminate the
detonation wave. In mixtures containing an excess
of fuel the greatest rate of rise of pressure was ob-
tained when the initial temperature was 75°C. Mix-
tures containing an excess of oxygen did not show
this maximum, but gave the greatest rate of rise of
pressure at the lowest initial temperature. These
results are in complete agreement with the results
obtained by all previous investigators who con-
ducted experiments over this temperature range.
These facts serve also to explain the contradic-
tory statements concerning the effect of initial tem-
perature given above. These results may be ex-
plained as follows: If a volume of gas at 300°
absolute is heated sufficiently to raise its temper-
ature 300°, the absolute initial pressure is doubled.
If a gas at 900• absolute is raised 300°, the absolute
initial pressure is increased only one-third All

other factors being constant, the higher the initial
temperature, the less will be the rise of pressure for
a given amount of heat supplied to the mixture,
The higher the temperature the more rapid is the
chemical reaction and the heat is supplied faster.
There are then these two factors, one decreasing
the magnitude of the pressure rise with an increase
of temperature, and the other increasing the rate
of pressure rise with increasing temperature. When
both of these factors are considered together, it is
evident that there will be some initial temperature
at which the rate of rise of pressure will be a maxi-
mum.
The fact that an increase in initial temperature
of the explosive mixture invariably increases the
tendency of an engine to knock, and an increase in
initial temperature above 75'C. invariably decreases
the rate of rise of pressure and tendency to detonate
in bomb explosions clearly indicates that the re-
action occurring in the engine cylinder is decidedly
different from the progressive reaction occurring in
a bomb.
It has been known for some time that the con-
dition of the surface of the bomb or tube has very
slight effect upon the detonation wave developed in
the bomb or tube explosion. It is also well known
that the condition of the surface within the com-
bustion chamber of an internal combustion engine
has a very marked effect upon the engine knock.
As a general rule sleeve valve engines do not knock
as badly as the poppet valve engines. This differ-
ence is due to the fact that the exhaust valve op-
erates at a very high temperature while the exhaust
port in the sleeve valve engine is more efficiently
cooled and operates at a much lower temperature.
This fact has been verified by engine designers who
have built engines with a single valve used as an
intake and exhaust valve. In these engines the
cooled mixture entering the cylinder through the
same valve through which the hot exhaust gases
pass out of the cylinder, cools this valve sufficiently
to practically eliminate the engine knock.
The relative knocking tendency of different fuels
has been investigated very thoroughly by Harry
Ricardo in England, but until now no investigation
has been made as to the rate of rise of pressure of
different fuels exploded in bombs. This work was
undertaken in the bomb shown in Figure 1 with the
results given in Table I.

speed of 80 miles per hour and has a cruising

speed, and a carrying capacity of 90,000 pounds.
Besides a crew of 12 officers and 30 men, the Los
Angeles has sleeping accommodations for 20 pas-
sengers. At one time the ship has carried a total
of 75 persons, including the crew.
The Los Angeles is slightly shorter than her
sister ship, the ill-fated Shenandoah, which was
destroyed in a line squall over Ohio last year, but
is "six feet higher and has a gas capacity 285.000
cubic feet greater, develops 750 more horsepower
and has a greater cruising radius and higher
speed.
The Navy's pride, as the Los Angeles is often
termed, was built by the Zeppelin Co. for the
United States as part of the reparations of war, in
Friedrichshafen, Germany. She was flown from
Germany to Lakehurst, N. J., in October, 1924,
making the longest non-stop flight of history. Her
first flight under American command was made
November 26, 1924. In charge of Commander J.
H. Klein, the dirigible flew to Washington from
Lakehurst. A landing was made at Boiling Field,
where the ship was christened the Los Angeles by
Mrs. Calvin Coolidgc.
The flight of the Los Angeles from Lakehurst to
the Ford Airport was said by the Navy Depart-
ment to be a "training trip to map out commercial
air routes."
When over Toledo, the Los Angeles came in
contact with a radio beacon and used its direction
finding apparatus to lay out its course from time
to time by the radio signals until it reached the
airport. On the trip from Lakehurst the radio gen-
erator on the dirigible failed and left the ship
without the use of its main radio. Communication
was maintained with radio stations on the ground
along the route by means of a emergency set.
Thousands of people visited the airport during-
Friday to view the great air-liner. Many cameras
snapped and clicked as those fortunate enough to
witness the spectacle proceeded to record the sight
for those who were not able to see it.
It was at first planned to have the Los Angeles
remain at the airport until Saturday morning when
it was to take off for Youngstown, Ohio, where it
was to take part in the dedication of a municipal
landing field named in honor of Commander Xach-
ary Lansdowne, who lost his life in the Shenan-
doah disaster last year. Lieutenant-Commander
Rosendahl, after receiving the report from the
United States Weather Bureau of an approaching-
low area presaging severe winds, decided to have
the dirigible refueled and to start the return jour-
ney direct to Lakehurst, the airship's base, at 3 :30
p. m. on Friday instead of Saturday as originally
planned.
More than 1.000 gallons of gasoline was pumped
aboard the ship by means of pipe lines which ex-
tend to the mast's tip from which a hose con-
ducted the gas into the nose of the craft and down
the interior to the fuel tanks on either side.
Helium, with which the ten gas cells within the
dirigible are inflated, was taken on during -the
morning. The helium gas had been stored in steel
cylinders at the airport for the past 18 months.
They were sent there in anticipation of the ex-
pected visit of the Los Angeles to Detroit a year
ago last spring. Then it was set aside for use by
the Shenandoah, which was overtaken by disaster
before she reached the airport. More than 40.000
cubic feet of helium were released from the bat-
tery of cylinders at the mast's base and were con-
ducted upward to the dirigible through a pipe and
thence through a flexible appendix tube to the cells
of the ship.
During the re-fueling and re-gassing process an-
other type of preparation was taking place. Pro-
visions were taken on board. These included roast
chicken, veal cutlets, ham, bacon, soup, 40 dozen
eggs, 100 loaves of bread and 40 pies. The list
totaled 300 pounds in all.
A trip aboard the airship provided thrills for all.
To gain entrance to the craft one had to climb a
few rungs of an iron ladder extending up one of
the upright steel beams making up the top of the
mooring tower and thence step across to the
swinging gang-plank of the Los Angeles. No one

paused to look down the intervening space, some
200 or more feet, between the top of the mast and
the ground below, until he was safely across and
hanging tightly to the guide wires at either side of
the gang-plank.
Once within the huge nose of the ship, the vis-
itor is led down a series of steps by the guide until
he is at the level of the keel of the dirigible. The
steps which lead down a sharp incline are fastened
atop one of the duralumin girders which seem to
run in all directions throughout the interior. These
steps are extremely narrow and rather unstable to
one not used to traversing them.
A guard rail or rope extends along either side of
the steps and along the "cat-walk" as the run-way
extending the length of the keel is termed. A mis-
step as one walks along the cat-walk and the next
one would be an exceptionally long one—reaching
\n fact to the ground beiow as the thin fabric
which stretches beneath would but slightly im-
pede one's progress downward.
Walking aft along the walk, one comes to a lad-
der leading down into the forward cabin of the
control car. Herein are located the helm by which
the ship's direction is controlled and also the con-
trols for maintaining constant altitude either by
discharging water ballast or bv valving helium gas.
The instruments in the control cabin or "bridge"
as it is known in nautical terminology are in many
ways similar to those aboard a vessel. A system
of signals exists by means of which the men in the
power cars are signalled when to start and stop the

the control apparatus remind one that the ship was
constructed in a foreign country.
Just aft of the bridge on looking through a nar-
row door which, like the partition walls dividing
the various rooms of the control car, is made of
extremely light material, one sees the radio room
of the ship.
Through another door one passes into a corridor
leading aft between four spacious compartments
which are the officers' quarters. Finished in red
with plush seats and silk curtains the staterooms
are pleasing in appearance. Everything used in
equipping the rooms is made for lightness. Even

the pillows used are made of eider-down and weigh
less than one-quarter what ordinary pillows do.
Each compartment is similar to an ordinary rail-
road Pullman. The scats pull out and make berths
for sleeping. Curtains divide the rooms into
smaller compartments when desired. Tables fit
into the window sills and meals are served while
the ship is traveling through the air.
Continuing aft, on one side of the corridor are
the small washrooms where the taps are so fixed
that just one pint of water can How into the bowl
at a time. On the opposite side is the galley in
which the ship's cook prepares the meals. All
cooking is done on an electric stove. Electric
power to operate the stove, the radio, and to light
the entire ship is furnished by small generators
driven by two small propellers swung below the
control car. As the ship cruises through the air.
these propellers are made to revolve by the air
streaming by and these in turn drive the generat-
ors furnishing electricity. All dishes, pots and pans
used aboard ship are of aluminum, following out
the policy of "lightness." Refrigeration is accom-
plished electrically.
Further aft at the extreme rear of the control
car is the navigation room. Here are placed the
instruments for navigating the craft through the
skies. Leading up to the cat-walk above from the
navigation room is a second ladder and one climbs
again to take up his "perilous" course along the

INDUSTRIES OF MICHIGAN-
I—PAPER-MAKING
By DONAL HAMILTON HAINES
PAPER, that commonplace stuff from which one
gets his morning- news, which comes around
the weekly bundle from the laundry, or is rolled
into the after-breakfast cigarette, has become such
an every-day affair that most of us are wholly in-
curious about it. Unless one happens to be of an
investigative turn of mind, or to live in Holyoke,
Mass., Monroe, Mich., or somewhere in Kalamazoo
valley, he never learns anything about the process
of manufacture—beyond the unexciting fact that it
used to be made of nothing but
rags and is now made of so
many other substances that it
is one of the factors contribut-
ing to the disappearance of the
forests, and that it is presently
to make the farmer indifferent
to the size of the ears in his
corn-fields provided the stalks
are vigorous.
Yet any man from Michigan,
sufficiently imbued with pride
in the industries of his state,
ought to be able to discuss
paper-making as intelligently
as he can the automobile in-
dustry or the manufacture of
stoves and furniture, for the 57
paper mills of Michigan turn
out something like 7,500,000
pounds of paper every day, and have raised the state
to high rank in paper production, for in point or
tonnage, Michigan is surpassed only by New York,
Pennsylvania, Maine and Wisconsin.
But neither state pride nor an inclination toward
the technical is required to make the story ot
paper-making one of absorbing interest, for, both
by reason of its prominent role in the earliest po-
litico-industrial history of the country and the
technical steps in its development to its present
state, it has a chronicle just as full of romance as
that of any other of our great industrial growths.
Beyond this, it occupies an almost unique position,
for it has at the same time grown into a highly
scientific, mechano-chemical process, and at the
same time, to an even greater extent abroad than
in this country, remained a skilled handicraft.
No one is ready to watch intelligently the proc-
ess of paper-making in one of the great mills at
Kalamazoo, Monroe, Niles, Three Rivers, Port
THIS is the first of a series of
four articles upon Michi-
gan's industries by Mr. Haines.
The vast natural resources of the
state, combined with a people
whose energy is unsurpassed,
have given her a most prominent
place among the states of the
Union. From a large fund of first-
hand information Mr. Haines will
endeavor to set before us the
present state of four of these in-
dustries and the romance of their
growth. Because of its complex-
ity and its already being well
known, automobile manufacture
will be excluded.—The Editor.
Huron or any of the other Michigan centers of the
business without at least a bit of the historical
background, for without it he cannot realize the
growth from the early hand methods to the huge
Fourdrinier machines of the present, or the sound-
ness of the old craftsman's methods, which have
been modified instead of obliterated by the work
of the engineer and chemist.
Paper-making goes a long way back into the
early period of industrial history, so long a way,
indeed, that no more can be
done here than mention in
passing that the first British
patent for paper-making was
granted to one Charles Hilde-
garde in February, 1665, for
"the way and art of making-
blue paper used by sugar bak-
ers and others." The trade in
England (which was then and
for many years afterwards, of
course, wholly a matter of
hand-work) suffered many vi-
cissitudes before it began its
trans-atlantic history, gaining
for a time and then falling into
decay so that most of the paper
had to be brought to it from
other parts of the world.
There is some uncertainty as
to the date of the beginning of the American branch
of the industry. One account states that a certain
Mr. Wilcox, who furnished paper for Benjamin
Franklin, erected a paper-mill at Chester Creek,
Delaware County, Pa., in 1714, while another ac-
count records the erection of this mill in 1729. Fol-
lowing these first mills, others came into being in
New England, the Middle Atlantic, and, to a lesser
extent, in the Southern states, but the state of the
business remained for some time even more pre-
carious than it had been in England, although its
extreme importance was from the outset appreci-
ated by the Colonists to such an extent that several
of the Colonial governments offered bonuses ot very-
respectable size for its encouragement. Crudeness
of methods and machinery, and particularly the
total dependence on skilled labor and the scarcity
tif that commodity kept the production of paper far
below what it should have been for some gener-
ations.

At the time of the American Revolution the
scarcity of paper, the low state of the industry and
the critical need for more of the article produced
some highly interesting measures on the part of

makers were exempted from military service, while
Pennsylvania actually went the length of prevent-
ing these invaluable craftsmen from voluntarily
joining the Continental Army. In spite of such
measures, the supply ran low and the government
was compelled, shortly before the Battle of Mon-
mouth, to relieve soldiers of other duties and send
squads of them combing the garrets and rubbish-
heaps of the country for every available scrap of
the precious commodity.
During this period (readily enough imagined by
editors and publishers who were pinched by the
paper shortage of the Great War days) the con-
nection between the newspaper publisher and the
paper-maker was far closer—and perhaps friendlier
—than now, and the need of one was so strikingly
the necessity of the other that the newspapers of
the time are full of appeals to the housewives of
the country to save their rags, even to the tiniest
scraps, lest the press of the new republic be wholly
paralyzed!
Before passing to the period of the great me-
chanical inventions which modified the industry
and made possible its enormous growth during the
next few generations, it is well to glance at the
cruder methods of an early day, both for the sake
of understanding the difficulties which beset the
paper-maker and the reasons why his "mould" and
"deckel," very different in form but the same in
principle, are still to be found in the huge plants
of the present.
There was nothing essentially different in the
problem which confronted the early European
paper-maker than that which had been solved by
his Chinese predecessor, who made paper from the
bark of the mulberry tree. He required small,
tough fibres, the cellulose portions of plants, and
he got them from rags where the more primitive
Oriental (perhaps foreseeing the wood-pulp era)
went to the tree itself. The rags, by crude and
most odorous methods, were reduced to pulp, and,
since no aid had yet come from the chemist, the
color of the paper was determined by the color of
the rags from which the pulp had been made.
Once the fibres had been separated from all for-
eign matter and reduced to a pulp, the actual for-
mation of the sheets was begun. An oblong screen
of wire or cloth was employed, surrounded bv a
light frame. This mould was filled with the pulp,
then another light and very shallow frame, of ex-
actly the same size, called the "deckel," was fitted
on above, the depth of this upper frame determin-
ing the thickness of the paper. The operator
moved the mould back and forth, draining out the
water and keeping the mass of pulp in constant
motion. When this had been continued until the
water was thoroughly drained away and the sheet
of pulp given some form, Ihe mould was passed to
a second man, called the "coucher," who turned
out the moist sheet on a strip of felt fastened on a
board. Over the soft paper was placed another
sheet of felt, then a second mouldful of paper, then
more felt, until a stack or "post" several quires in
thickness had been built up. This pile was then
subjected to heavy pressure, which squeezed out
practically all the remaining water, leaving the
sheets of paper of sufficient strength so that they
could be put through a second pressing without
the use of the felt. The paper was then hung over

metal rollers if a greater degree of smoothness was
required.
This covers the whole hand-made process—still
practiced to a small extent in this country, and
still more widely in England, all Bank of England
notes being printed on hand-made paper.
Modern inventive progress has speeded up the
whole process and almost wholly eliminated the
use of human hands; it has provided other mate-
rials than rags; it has wrought miracles in color
and texture, but it
has not done away
with mould and dec-
kel, post and sizing-
tub—nor has it, on
the human side,
eliminated the hum-
ble rag picker!
In mills where
high - grade papers
are manufactured,
rags still form all or
nearly all of the raw
material, and in the
process of reducing
these rags to the
state in which they
are ready to be car-
ried on to the great
machines, hand-
labor i s still re-
quired, although it
does not do all of the work by any means. There
are "thrashers," "dusters," "devils" or "whippers"
for cleaning and shredding the rags before they are
touched by steam, water or chemicals, yet these
devices, whose names themselves are sufficient de-
scriptions, have their limitations. They can reduce
a discarded gingham dress to shredded fragments
ready for the final cleansing and bleaching pro-
cesses, but, alas, they cannot remove clinging but-
tons and hooks and eyes, and for this human hands
are still needed.
In the main, the business of reducing the shred-
ded mass of rags to pulp is just a machine-done
imitation of the original business on a huge scale,
but, thanks to the assistance of the chemist, new
elements have been introduced at this point in the
transformation. In the "beaters" where the final
washings and shreddings are accomplished, other
processes now go on at the same time. Sizing mat-
ter, aniline dyes for tinting the paper, and any
necessary adulterations are effected at this point in
the process. These adulterations are required when
it is desired to combine good appearance with
cheapness, or to make the paper more opaque for
printing purposes with o u t making it actually
thicker, which is done through the introduction of
clay filler, or some cheap, heavy fibres.
As happens so frequently in the histories of
human achievements which have endured, there is
a tragic tale connected with the greatest single
step forward in the long development of papet-
niaking. The men who brought to perfection the
apparatus which was the prototype of most of the
great machines now in operation — Henry and
Sealy Fourdrinicr—gained from their efforts noth-
^_^^^^_^_^^^_^^^____^ ing but the name,
and died in want be-
fore they knew they
had gained even this
emptv honor!
The problem
which the modern
paper-maker had to
solve, and to which
these two brothers
gave their lives and
fortunes, was simple
in its principle but
enormously complex
in the mechanical
devices which it re-
quired. What they

the tough fabric, not
in single sheets but
in a continuous web. The first machine which act-
ually did this was the invention of a Frenchman,
Louis Robert, a workman in a mill at Enonnes,
France. He sold his patent to M. Didot, his em-
ployer, who carried it to England. Here it was ac-
quired by the Brothers Fourdrinier, who, with their
expert engineer, Bryan Donkin, brought it close to
its present state, although they reaped no benefits
from their work.
Any printed description of the operation of the
Fourdrinier machine is at best a poor substitute,
for any layman with a most un-mechanical mind
can get a very comprehensive notion of the entire
performance by standing beside one of the ma-
chines for five minutes or less.
For the mould of the old days there has been
substituted a huge container, the "stuff chest" into
which a continuous supply of the pulp in solution
is poured from the beaters. An endless belt of
wire-cloth picks up the pulp, which is spread to an
even thickness by the descendant of the original
deckel, the water drained out through the revolv-
ing wire, and the painfully slow shaking of the
mould once done by hand now done a thousand
times more rapidly and effectively by machine-

REFRIGERATION WITH GAS
By HUGH E. KEELER, M. S. E.
Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering, Universify of Michigan
A FIRST glance at the above title will not give
to the reader a definite idea of what this article
proposes to cover without a few words of explan-
ation.
It is intended in what follows to discuss in a
general way the field of
household refrigeration
and how this service is
made possible by the use
of electrical energy from
the lines of the electrical
supply companies. Next
it will be shown that it
is highly desirable for the
gas companies to be able
to sell gas for the pur-
pose of household refrig-
eration and that house-
hold refrigeration may be
produced by the combus-
tion of ordinary illumin-
ating gas is suitably de-
signed refrigerating ma-
chines of the absorption
type. After this there
will follow a discussion of
some of the important
problems in connection
with the whole field of
household refrigeration
and especially those in
connection with the ap-
plication of gas to this
service.
It is well to recognize at the outset that the man-
ufacture and sale of any type of equipment can have
its origin in either of two fairly distinct ways.
First, it may be equipment which at the outset is
not a necessity and for which a desire must be cre-
ated in the minds of the purchasing public to the
extent that its successful manufacture and sale is
assured. Radio equipment is an example of this
class. Secondly, the equipment may be that which
renders an essential service in a much better man-
ner than any other previous method or equipment
has done, and as a result is in a position to more
easily acquire a ready manufacture and sale.
It is evident that household refrigeration, pre-
vious to the introduction of the small refrigerating
machine, was universally produced by ice, and that
although this method of producing refrigeration
PLATEN-MUNTERS ABSORPTION TYPE HOUSE-
HOLD REFRIGERATING MACHINE INSTALLED IN
CABINET
was very much better than none at all it never-
theless had many objectionable features. Therefore,
any new method or equipment whereby household
refrigeration could be more satisfactorily produced
than by the use of ice possessed an advantage for
commercial success.
There was also another
important factor operat-
ing for the introduction
and success of household
refrigeration. This was
the desire on the part of
the electric supply cor-
porations to acquire the
motor load which house-
hold refrigeration would
offer and the resulting
revenue which it would
produce. It was generally
conceded and statistics
show that the revenue per
kilowatt of connected
load is greater from dom-
estic refrigerating ma-
chines than from any
other class of electrically
operated household appli-
ances. The electric sup-
ply companies were thus
interested in the develop-
ment of household refrig-
eration and have always
been a helpful factor in its
development.
Up to the present time practically all household
refrigeration is produced by motor operated, com-
pression type machines. All of the essential ele-
ments of the large, commercial plant are present in
these household machines. These elements are: an
electric motor, refrigerant, expansion coils, expan-
sion valve, compressor, condenser for the refriger-
ant, receiver for the refrigerant, and automatic con-
trol devices. The refrigerant most generally used
at the present time is sulphur dioxide, although
other refrigerants such as methyl chloride, ethyl
chloride, ammonia, butane, and others have been
used and are used to some extent at present. The
small household machines of the compression type
are available in two types; one having a water-
cooled condenser for the refrigerant and the other
having an air-cooled condenser. Because of the


November. 1926
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
simplicity of the air-cooled type it is meeting with
greatest favor.
At the present time the electrically operated
household refrigerating machine is being manufac-
tured and sold in enormous quantities and its suc-
cess and permanency as a household appliance is
assured as well as its great ability as a revenue
producer for the electric generating companies.
At this point it will be interesting to look at the
problem of household refrigeration from the stand-
point of the gas companies. It will also be interest-
ing to see the rather unusual conditions existing.
The fact that the electric generating companies
PLATEN-MUNTERS ABSORPTION TYPE HOUSEHOLD RE-
FRIGERATING MACHINE. MANUFACTURED BY THE
SERVEL CORP., 51 EAST 42nd ST., NEW YORK CITY
have acquired such a large amount of this newly
developed and highly profitable load, and that it is
being continually connected to their lines has re-
cently brought about the query from the gas com-
panies as to whether or not they can render this
household refrigerating service and receive tiie
same profitable revenue from this class of service
that the electric generating companies receive. It
should be here stated that the production of revenue
and the sale of a highly profitable appliance is not
the only motive for gas companies to promote the
sale of machines for the production of refrigeration.
The gas companies are desirous of serving their
consumers with all kinds of service in which gas
can serve them advantageously; they are desirous
of building up the best diversity factor possible on
their gas generating plants and distribution sys-
tems, as an increase in total send-out of gas from a
given plant and through a distribution system re-
sults in lowered rates to the consumer. And con-
trary to common belief a gas company would much
prefer to sell a large amount of gas at a low rate
than a small amount of gas at a high rate.
In addition to the above there is another im-
portant factor along with the utilization of illumi-
nating gas for household refrigeration. The im-
portance of developing a house heating load and a
household refrigeration load simultaneously lies in
the fact that when the heating load tends toward a
maximum the refrigerating load tends toward a
minimum and there is thus a more uniform load
on the system throughout the year.
Having discussed the desirability for a gas com-
pany to build up a household refrigerating load, we
will next see what apparatus is necessary to pro-
duce refrigeration by the combustion of illuminat-
ing gas. We will start by considering the com-
pression type of household refrigerating machine
which is operated by an electric motor, and show
that this is not a practical type for producing re-
frigeration by means of gas.
In the compression type of machine some source
of mechanical work must be available for driving
the compressor. This source is of course the elec-
tric motor, the electrical energy being thus con-
verted into mechanical work. If gas were used
instead of electrical energy for driving the com-
pressor it would of course be necessary to convert
the potential chemical energy of the gas into heat
energy by the process of combustion and then by
some means to convert as much as possible of this
heat energy into mechanical work. Of course the
most convenient way of doing this would be to use
a small gas engine. It is readily seen that this is
an impractical method because a gas engine re-
quires frequent attention and lubrication, would be
objectionably noisy in this service and is not at all
adapted for frequent starting and stopping by ther-
mostatic control. It is these objectionable features
that make it impractical to employ city gas as a
source of power for operating small household re-
frigerating machines of the compression type.
It now remains to consider what processes are
available whereby refrigeration may be produced
directly by the application of heat. Of the processes
and methods whereby refrigeration may be pro-
duced by the direct application of heat, there is only
one in everyday use at the present time, and it will
be the only one discussed and considered here.
This method of refrigeration is known as the "ab-
sorption system" and produces a refrigerating effect
by the direct application of heat, and is conse-

AN ARCHITECTURAL SUMMER SCHOOL
By K. D. RICH Jr.. '27A
THE current belief, it seems, is that any sum-
mer session is a time at which scholastic de-
linquents can retrieve their honor, and at the same
time take advantage of a glorious opportunity for
play. This is a very erroneous conception and it
is the purpose of this
article to correct any
such beliefs, and in a
concrete way prove
that this is not the
case as far as an ar-
chitectural summer
school -is concerned.
In the early begin-
ning of s u m m e r
work in the Univers-
ity of Michigan, the
number of students was very small, eight or nine
being the average number. However, there has
been an exceedingly rapid expansion of this phase
of student education, and during the last summer,
we find a total of 68 men and women who elected
to continue their work during the vacation month.s.
Up until the 1926 session the number of students
had been small enough so that one man could suc-
cessfully carry on the instruction of the whole
group, but with the increased enrollment of the last
session, it made it necessary to call in Assistant
Professor Bennett to assist Professor Rousseau by
taking charge of elemeritary design.
The University of Michigan is one of the three
American universities to offer summer courses in
design. This part of the architect's training is un-
doubtedly the most essential, so we lind not only
regular students of the University, but men from
other colleges and a few experienced architects and
draughtsmen who are availing themselves of this
opportunity of increasing their knowledge of de-
sign by attending a session which does not cause
them to leave their offices for so long a period as
would be necessitated during a regular school year.

Along with this work in design the college of-
fered a course in outdoor sketching under the di-
rection of Mr. Slusser. The choice of medium was
optional: pencil, charcoal, or pastel, but the ma-
jority used water color, and some very good re-
sults were obtained.
As is the case
with any profession-
al school, the atti-
tude of the students
is very startling to
an outsider. I t i s
upon the knowledge
which they acquire
in college that they
must depend to
make a living. They
are interested in their work before all else; hence
we find a mutual striving to excell which is
not at all a superficial desire for good marks, but
rather their work may prove to be a good indi-
cation of the success they hope to achieve in the
field of architecture. There is a striving to be well
informed in the other arts so closely allied to ar-
chitecture as every student must realize, before he
goes very deeply into the study of his subject, that

a successful architect must also be a broadly cul-
tured man if he wishes his architecture to be -a
distinct contribution.
In summer school this attitude was more ob-
vious than during the regular session of the col-

lege. Inasmuch as most of the students were
studying only design, it left their minds free from
the distraction of other subjects, and as a result
their whole efforts were directed along this one
line. The success of the work was in some meas-
ure due to the speed with which it was necessary
to work. The time allowed was only halt that of a
semester so it was necessary to work as furiously
as possible in order to earn the maximum amount
of credit. There is an added incentive to work in
the companionship of others who are hard at work,
and nightly vigils over the draughting table help
greatly to make close friends out of the acquaint-
ances which mutual interest always creates. \\ e
find students literally spending nine-tenths of their
waking hours in the drawing rooms and thor-
oughly enjoying it. The added stimulus of being
able to associate wth men of the calibre that make
up the architectural faculty is a great thing in it-
self to bring forth good work and a general feeling
of emulation.
Under these conditions it is not surprising that
the finished problems show a high degree of excel-

the longer period. In the elementary and interme-
diate courses problems are assigned with certain
limitations and conditions. It is then the task of
the student to create a design which fulfills these
rules, and is a distinct offering and logical solution
in itself. In the first courses we find students
learning the elements of design, studying the clas-
sic orders, and how to adapt them to designs and
the technicalities of architectural rendering. By
the time the student has completed the first four
courses it is felt that he is then able to put the

archaeological aside, and do creative work. In Ar-
chitecture 7 he receives his first plan problem, and
learns how to group rooms and develop elevations
according to rules of good composition. In Archi-
tecture 8 the plans become more and more compli-
cated and special attention is placed on detail and
its relation to the building, for it is this primarily
which changes a building from a mass of stone to
an artistic work. It is not until he reaches his last
two courses that he can choose his own problem,
He is guided in his choice by his instructor and
practically the only limitation is that it must in-
volve group planning, i.e., the relation of one build-
ing to a number of others.
When the problems were all assembled at the
close of the summer session a verv interesting as-
sortment resulted. From the classical fountains,
entrances, interiors, and band stands of the ele-
mentary courses, the mortuary chapels, casinos and
country clubs of the intermediate courses to the
advanced problems which included church and
school groups and even a complete community in
a picturesque setting we find a startling variety
characterized by originality of design and quality
of rendering.
With these fine results we can feel justly enthu-
siastic over the success of the summer session, and
those who are planning to attend in the future
should feel highly enthused at the prospect of be-
ing able to study under such satisfactory con-
ditions.

THE ART OF THE PLASTERER
By OTTO G. BERNTHAL, B. S. A.
AMONG the existing building materials closely
correlated with the arts and the craftsmanship
of the same is one material which has always been
of intrinsic value. Plaster, an all important me-
dium for the expression of ornament and decoration
and also a basis for mural paintings is probably as
old as the art itself. It has been used to both good
and bad advantage. Wholesale malicious treatment
&lt;.f the material at times has been most pronounced.
It is a pliable material and
is extremely flexible in its
uses. It is durable, sym-
pathetic and is susceptible
to every touch received by
the hand of the worker. It
can be modelled, cast, in-
cised, colored, stencilled or
stamped.
Among the ancient ruins
of Mesopotamia which
dated back to from 3000 to
3500 B. C. were found rem-
nants of walls of modeled
stucco embellished with
frescoes a n d decorative
ornament. At the Royal
Academy Winter Exhibi-
tion in 1903, Dr. Kvans re-
vealed some drawings of
fragments of plastered ceil-
ings, ornamented with a
repeated pattern o f con-
nected spirals modeled in
relief and decorated in
color. The approximate
dates of the destruction of
these buildings has been given by authorities as
1500 B. C.
When and where stucco was first used is un-
known but that it was in use in ancient times is an
established fact. The Egyptians applied a thin coat
of this material to the walls of their structures to
cover the seams of the stones and to afford a means
for the application of mural decoration. The Greeks
made similar advancements and used only materials
of the best quality. The Romans also frequently
covered their rough building material with a coat
of stucco to fill in holes of the porous travertine.
The properties of stucco were well known in
ancient times and with that in mind it was used to
the best advantage. It had for its base generally a
burned carbonate of limestone or chalk. Stucco was
prepared very carefully in ancient times as com-

pared with the modern methods. Detailed instruc-
tions have been found as to its preparation. With
such a medium at their command they modeled
directly since the material set slowly smooth and
hard. It is also impervious to water and severe cli-
matic conditions. So good was the material and
sensitive at the time of application that jewelers
sometimes used it in preference to wax for small
castings. Vitrivous tells us that the aggregate was
so fine and compact and
the finished surface so.
smooth and dense that
when polished it could be
used for a mirror. The
material will weather bet-
ter than marble. It is not
to be wondered then that
the Greeks whose art, arch-
itecture and materials of
construction have estab-
lished a code toward mod-
e r n building perfection,
used this material. No
good samples of Greek
modeling remain intact but
some Roman panels o f
Greek influence have been
uncovered. These consist
of divided panels with egg
and tongue mouldings. The
panels are filled with fig-
ures in relief exquisitely
designed and modeled. An
example of this stucco
modeling is found on a
vault of a tomb in the Via
Latina which was executed by a light of a torch-
light and was intended to be observed through the
use of the same medium. The lines of the figures
are slightly curved but is nevertheless characteristic
of pure wall decoration. Many other examples are
found in Rome.
The beauty in stucco, its purity in design, and
its mastery in execution can be noted by the sim-
plicity and delicacy of the models. Very often the
swing of a crude tool produced incised lines. At
the Baths of Titus the color is beautifully combined
with the modeling particularly in the panels and
louvetts and between the mouldings where the dec-
oration is chiefly paintings. Pompeii is also pro-
ductive of some good examples.
During the Dark Ages and the barbarism follow-
ing the vacadence of Rome there was a temporary

lapse in the use of plaster. Perhaps the best ex-
ample produced at this time was the decoration and
modeling in the Alhambra, the Moorish Temple.
The excellence of the work in stucco-duro of the
Italian Renaissance was an important influence on
European art. The rediscovery of the genuine

A WORK OF THE ADAM BROTHERS
stucco-duro of the ancient Romans together with
the unearthing of finely modeled ornament in a
state of excellent preservation created supreme in-
terest and the work occupied the attention of some
of the greatest figures of the Renaissance. The re-
establishment of the ancient art was mainly through
the efforts and researches of Cardinal Giovanni in
the year 1488, in seeking for sculpture of modern
times. He carried on extensive excavations at the
request of his father and unearthed some rare ex-
amples of stucco-duro that had been lost to civil-
ization for many centuries. Thus he was instru-
mental in re-establishing the uses of plaster. About
this time Andrea di Cosimo began the practice of
covering the fronts of houses and palaces with a
coating of plaster wherein the black of ground
charcoal and straws had been mixed. Raphael, an-
other student of the Italian Renaissance, was one
who was allowed to examine these discoveries. Ills
associate, Giovanni, then set himself to work on
experiments the result of which was the exact for-
mula of stucco-duro as prepared by the ancient
Greeks. There was in use, previous to this time
;:mong the Florentine artists, a material which they
called stucco, but this was much inferior to the
ancient stucco-duro and was used only on works
of lesser importance. In working out color designs,
the ground color was applied while the material
was still wet, as in fresco, and then the final touches
put on.
Due to the enormous amount of stucco work
done in the sixteenth century the tendency was to
fall back to the use of common stucco because it
was less expensive and required less care in its
preparation. But with the influence of such sup-
porters as Raphael the hard stucco-duro was still
retained primarily for interior work.
At this time arabesque or grotesque painting was
in vogue and again with Raphael's influence the
art flourished. The term grotesque has been mis-
used among the English. The general trend of
thought was that the art was uncouth, whimsical
and misrepresenting. But as a matter of fact when
the word is properly applied it implies delicate
linear decoration. It was ornament neither mathe-
matical nor conventional but based on actual or
possible form, and varied from naturalism to con-
ventionalism. Thus the term, whether in painting
or sculpture, implies foliage, flowers and fruit with
stems intertwined arbitrarily according to the
choice of the designer. The same was true of ara-
besque, where the English interpretation implied
the production of ornament in wholesale quantities,
in any conceivable form, by means of a chisel and
a brush. Whereas the real translation of the word
suggested leaves and flowers only drawn almost
exclusively with a point. The use of stucco-duro
under the influence of Raphael had a diversity .if
uses in sculpture, wall relief and a base for mural
decoration. Some of the best examples produced
by Raphael was during the sixteenth century.
Scratched ornament was another method for the
supplication of plaster. It was described by a French
;&lt;uthor in 1770 as a sort of black and white frescoe.
This art was revived by Andrea Feltrini. The
fronts of buildings were covered with a coating of
black plaster over which, while still in a fresh con-
dition, was applied a layer of white stucco. Car-
toons were transferred to this whereupon the out-
line was hatched with a graving iron thus revealing
the black plaster underneath. After this the whole
work was gone over with a dark water color. The

first facade done in this manner was that of the
Palazzo Gondi in Florence. Cosimo and his pupils
did much of this work in Florence during the six-
teenth century. From Italy the art spread all over


Page 21

Europe and reached England during the reign of
Henry VIII.
In England, however, before the advent of elab-
orately decorated ceilings, plaster work was applied
chiefly to the exteriors. This system, prevalent in
the fifteenth century, called the "Waddle and Dab"
system, was used to cover exterior timber work.
The material was merely thrown on until the de-
sired thickness was obtained. It was then combed
down with a pointed stick. With the introduction
of stucco-duro this old system gradually became
obsolete and 'Targe" work came into existence. It
was usually done by local plasterers. Sometimes
the structural beams were left exposed, thus form-
ing panels. Other samples had a full coating ap-
plied over lath. While the material was still soft,
zig-zag and other designs were incised in the plas-
ter with a pointed instrument or stick. Various
designs were thus carried out as the craft developed
some interesting examples of which may be found
in Conney Street, York, England. So the English
plasterer flourished until the end of the seventeenth
century.
At the end of the seventeenth century the Italian
influence became apparent especially in interior
work and ceiling designs. But the problem pre-
sented its difficulties with the Italian worker. The
climate was different as well as the life of the
people. The simple homes of the English were in
great contrast with the large and spacious halls of
France and Italy. So at first none but the simple
type of rib on the ceiling was attempted. The mode
of the work resembled very much that of the pres-
ent-day stencilling, but was very superior in qual-
ity. The craft seemed to be legitimate considering
the type of work to be accomplished. But when
color was added it appeared to be at a disadvantage
owing to the loss of freedom which should be felt
in that art.
As time went on the designs grew more compli-
cated and comprehensive. However, the simple
-profile of the rib was maintained but the number
increased and the intricacy of the design multiplied.
In the next stage of development was seen the
mouldings divided by a plain hollow member.
From the general characteristics of the designs it
was evident that the plasterer received ideas from
brocades and embroideries of Persia and Italy.
Many other suggestions were obtained from the
tapestries and needlework so popular at that time.
The paneling generally took the form of some geo-
metrical figure which gradually developed into a
radiating arrangement of ribs and focused the eye
at a single point of interest. Then came the use of
pendants. In Queen Elizabeth,s time the ceiling
chiefly consisted of double moulded ribs between
which was running enrichments of sprigs and
sprays of flowers, medallions and panels of floral
ornament enriching the panel spaces so formed.
The method of stamping the ceilings of the early
Elizabethan period was somewhat as follows: The
design was modeled in plaster or clay and a mould
was cast from the same in plaster. This mould was
then greased and filled with semi-liquid plaster and
applied to the ceiling. It was held in this position
until sufficiently hard to warrant the removal of
the mould. The ornament was then gone over with
a tool and polished. Sometimes plaster of Paris
was used in these casts because it was less expen-
.sive and produced the desired results. One advant-

age gained by casting was its property of possess-
ing great softness of texture combined with a cer-
tain dullness which may be regarded as a distinctive
quality of soft material such as plaster of Paris.
On the other hand there was a loss of intellectual
effort on the part of the worker because of its rap-
idity in setting, it limited the chance of freedom
for variation in design as the material was applied.
This method spread rapidly and everyone insisted
on elaborately decorated interiors in plaster and
the plasterer was not slow in taking advantage of
the craze of the day for ornament. The art flour-
ished through the reign of James and Charles and
not until the troubled days of the commonwealth
did it show any signs of deterioration. The size of
the panel increased until it became customary to
divide the ceiling area into four parts, whether
large or small. This quarter space was made to
contain a quarter design. This design was reversed
or doubled on the other side. Then the same thing
was repeated in the other two quarter sections,
i.hus completing the whole. In the frieze the plas-
terer had a more favorable opportunity to display
his genius than in the ceiling. Here he applied his
talents with more skill and fervor. Often these
friezes were enhanced with color and gild. At the
junction between the frieze and the ceiling there
was oftimes inserted a plaster moulding for tran-
sition. The ornament incised on the plaster frieze
was generally a scroll stem and leaf design. In-
numerable examples of this treatment may be found

THE TRAINING OF MEN
By R. E. DOHERTY, Consulting Engineer
I WISH to bring to your attention the vital need
of a well-organized and comprehensive pro
gram for the selection and training of men for the
future; to present, for your comments and advice,
the plans which have been put into effect and those
which are now being developed; and, finally, to
make an appeal for your active interest and co-op-
eration, both of which are absolutely essential to
the success of these undertakings.
The company's business has.doubled in the last
ten years, and it is expected to double again in the
next ten years. Shall we attempt to meet this
future merely by expanding the organization, or
shall we prepare for it by increasing the effective-
ness of the employees, thus requiring relatively
fewer of them?
The only course left open to us, if we would meet
the challenge of a great opportunity, is to train our
young men, organize and improve our methods so
that this greatly increased volume of business can
be handled with a much less than proportionate in-
crease in the number of employees.
It is my firm conviction that our objective for
the future, at least so far as engineering and com-
mercial activities are concerned, should be no less
than this: that we should set our plans to handle
the increasing business without a significant in-
crease, certainly not a proportionate increase, in
the number of employees in the Engineering De-
partment and in the related engineering activities
of the Commercial Department. This is a large
order, but the only thing which might prevent its
achievement is the possibility of there being too
small a percentage of us who are determined to see
it done.
Now, obviously, this could not be done merely
by speeding up the present organization, any more
than the output of the modern gasoline engine
could have been obtained from the old design—
however good it appeared in its day—merely by
increasing its speed. More appropriate materials
were required for certain parts, these more care-
•Offlcials of progressive industrial organization realize the
importance of continuing the training of college graduates in
tlieir employ with a view to qualifying them for the most ef-
fective service. The electrical industry has always been espe-
cially active in this educational field.
The following paper. "THE TRAINING OF MEN." which has
been carefully considered by executives and heads of depart-
ments of the General Electric Company, is presented as an
example of the thought that is being bestowed on this problem
by those responsible for the success of a large electrical cor-
poration. The paper is given in the same form it was pre-
sented to the General Electric officials and discussed by them
with department heads representing all branches of the General
Electric organization.
Mr. R. E. Doherty. author of the article, is a consulting engi-
neer. As a member of the Education Committee of General
Electric, he is profoundly interested in the subject and has
friven much time to the study of its various phases. Mr.

fully and scientifically formed and more effectively
balanced and co-ordinated; all of this was necessary
in order to accommodate the engine to its future
tasks. No less than this will adequately prepare
our human machine for the increased output of the
future. We must set our plans for a carefully se-
lected, capable, energetic, highly trained, efficiently
organized personnel. Changes of a basic nature arc
occurring so rapidly in the electrical industry that
one may easily lose perspective and proper pro-
portion. What was adequate yesterday in engineer-
ing, in manufacturing, and in the commercial field,
becomes inadequate for tomorrow. Two facts stand
out pre-eminently in any picture which we may trv
to form regarding the future. One is, as every one
recognized, a progressively keener competition; the
other, which I think is not yet sufficiently recog-
nized, is the rapidly increasing complexity of our
business and a corresponding growth in the re-
quired technique to handle it.
For illustration, take synchronous machines. For-
merly, most specifications for such machines con-
tained a few simple statements regarding efficiency,
dimensions, weight, and perhaps regulation. Today,
it is necessary to fill in many voluminous speci-
fications containing terms which, only ten years
ago. were not yet clearly understood by the design-
ing engineers themselves. This tendency is being
accelerated by the infiltration of engineers who
have been trained by the electrical manufacturers,
into the staffs of operating companies and the in-
dustry. Moreover, new operating conditions re-
quiring- engineering analysis are constantly being
encountered. What I have said about synchronous
machines is, in general aspects, also true of othci
apparatus. On all sides we find greater complexity.
So, by and large, the technique and general knowl-
edge required to appropriately and effectively rep-
resent the company in transactions dealing with
such matters have amazingly increased. And, as I
have said, these changes have crept upon us, not
altogether unrecognized, of course, but they have
not been adequately dealt with.
We are rapidly outgrowing our facilities. An or-
ganization and routine which were adequate in the
past have already been expanded beyond efficient
limits. The organization would seem to be based
in general upon the theory that all technical infor-
mation must flow by mail or messenger from the
General Office to the District, and that information
regarding the customer's requirements and oper-
ating conditions must flow from the District to the


Page 23
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
General Office; and that, therefore, it is neither
necessary to have the salesman well versed in en-
gineering, nor for the designing engineer to know,
first hand, the conditions under which his apparatus
is to operate. As a result, on the one hand, design-
ing engineers have not had sufficient contact in the
field, and on the other, many salesmen would un-
doubtedly be more effective if they had had more
practical engineering experience at the factory.
Thus we have an organization traffic line for in-
formation, extending from the
customer to the factory, along
which messengers and tons of
mail pass back and forth. As
the organization has grown
and the complexity of our bus-
iness has increased, this line
has also become further ex-
tended and more congested.
The ends have become further
apart not only in organization
distance, but also in point of
view. So we are approaching
the time, if we have not al-
ready reached it, when this
procedure will no longer suf-
fice. The more the business
grows and the greater is com-
plexity and technical require-
ments, all of which are certain
to happen, the worse this sit-
uation is bound to become.
And even if it now appears tol-
erable to some, it must be clear
what the future would bring with an unchanged
policy. The expense, the loss of valuable time, the
inevitable mistakes and complaints from such a sep-
aration of information sources, and such a gauntlet
of routine could all be greatly reduced by having
more of the preliminary engineering done in the
field. We should provide an opportunity for our
future salesmen to obtain engineering experience at
the factory, and urge them to take advantage of it.
We should plan on increasing the effectiveness of
every man along the line. We would thus, with
relatively fewer employees, better serve the cus-
tomer, the company, and the employees.
Now perhaps I have been a bit extravagant in
statement in order to depict with emphasis a per-
fectly definite, existing situation. When I propose
that, on the whole, the effectiveness of the men in-
volved in the foregoing picture should be greatly
increased, there is, of course, no intended implica-
tion that at present most of the men are not doing
good work, many of them most excellent work, in
the circumstances. As a matter of fact, this self-
same organization has wrought wonderful achieve-
ments; it has done the engineering work of g'cat
power systems, has electrified great industries, and
lighted the world. But we injure our point of view-
by dwelling long on our virtues. \\ ho is there
among us who will no-t at once concede that, how
ever good we now are, we not only can immensely
improve, but also that we must do so in order to
cope with the future?
I have outlined the obvious need for a compre-
hensive selection and training program. 1 shall now
take up certain specific items
of. such a program. Although
the Education Committee has
been making a broad survey of
all recruiting and educational
activities of the company, from
the Apprentice Congress up, it
is beyond my present scope to
review all of that work, I shall
confine my discussion to col-
lege men recruited for the Test
Course and who later enter the
Engineering and Commercial
Departments, my principal ob-
ject being to present the De-
partmental Plan.
With reference to the gener-
al program for engineering
graduates, I submit that our
plan should be as follows:
First, we should recruit the
best men we can, find at the
colleges; from this group we
should make progressive selec-
tions on the basis of natural aptitude and demon-
strated competence; we should adequately train and
definitely encourage the best of them, weed out
mediocrity, and then organize the procedure so that
the selected men can function efficiently—thus
gradually acquiring high-powered, highly efficient
teams of highly trained, adequately encouraged
men.
Please do not conclude that I am here making a
plea for the wholesale training of men in mathe-
matics. Most of the tasks under consideration here
are not of that character. The great majority of the
young men should have a general engineering and
business training which would involve mathematics
to a very moderate extent only; but it would in-
volve a thorough knowledge of the characteristics
of apparatus, of the problems of design and appli-
cation, of the company's engineering and commer-
cial methods, and the problem of factory production.
Such a training' is what most of our young men
should have. However, we do need a relatively-
small number of men who are thoroughly compe-

MODERNISM VERSUS TRADITION
Bv Locis G. JORDAN, '28A
THE new practical requirements resulting from
changes in the ways of living and conducting
business have to be met by present-day designers
and a -suitable architectural expression has to l:e
given to these requirements. There is a strong ef-
fort on the part of many
architects in this country
to produce architecture
that is vital; in fact, they
feel themselves practical-
ly compelled by the ad-
v ances and changes in the
world around them t-,
produce designs better
suited to our times and
needs than the school-cor-
rect buildings produced a
generation ago and ad-
mired for the scholarship
they display.
In this striving after a
new expression in archi-
tecture American archi-
tects as a rule make full
and intelligent use of the
rich store of historical de-
sign inspiration handed
down to them by the ar-
chitects of past genera-
tions. They are more in-
clined to a broad eclec-
tism and to the free interpretation of traditional de-
sign than to radical independence. 1 heir sound
training usually prevents them from committing
the excesses indulged in by some of the extreme
modernists among European designers.
In solving their problems some architects, not-
ably the extremists in (Germany and in countries
where the German influence is strong, have turned
completely away from tradition and sought to
build up a method of architectural design entirely
independent of anything the past mav have to
offer. They have produced some designs that look
more like battleships than buildings, and many
that look utterly unlike anything ever seen or im-
agined before. They have done this by what they
believe to be the logical development of the design
in terms of the materials of construction. Many of
these buildings are of concrete and have the ap-
pearance of being cast entire in a mold rather than
of being built.
The chief style characteristic of practically all of
AN EXTREME MODERNISTIC TYPE
these buildings is the set of mannerisms that has
come to be regarded as the basis of the Modern
Style, starting with the work which Frofessoi
Hoffman, of Vienna, and Peter Behrens and some
others did some twenty-five years ago. Neverthe-
less, each of these build-
ings is strongly marked
by the national character-
istics of the people it rep-
resents. This is due partly
to a free expression of the
national taste in form and
coloring and partly to the
use in a modified way of
elements found in the his-
toric design work of these
nations. However, it is
all embryonic, to say the
least, and there is appar-
ent too great a conscious
effort to do something
different.
A much better way, in
theorv at least, of attain-
ing a high degree of Mod-
ernism is the plan of pro-
cedure outlined some
twenty-five or thirty
years ago by Victor Hor-
ta, head of the Art Insti-
tute of Brussels for prac-
tically a lifetime. Dr. Horta advised the thorough
understanding of practical modern requirements
and a thorough study of methods of construction.
In addition he advised the analytical study of his-
toric design with a view to gaining an understand-
ing of the basic principles which underlie such de-
sign. He proposed that the architect, having had
this training, should design not only in accordance
with the practical requirements, and the nature of
the material, but in conformity with the basic prin-
ciples of good design revealed by the work of the
past, (jood as Dr. Horta's theory was it seems
never to have brought any significant practical re-
sults in application. The work of extreme modern-
ists or those who are attempting to make them-
selves independent of the past, forces upon us the
conviction that no man or group of men can create
in a lifetime a manner of architectural expression
approaching the excellence of the work produced
by those who make proper use of the traditions that

ment, the great chaotic world of business, assailing
it for the lack of direction it gives him. Quite un-
consciously he has carried over into the business
world the habits and expectations of the campus.
He thinks of himself as taking a sort of postgradu-
ate course, misses a set curriculum and marks. If
there are college men who discern only too plainly
the line of their ascent, far more complain, "What's
ahead of me? That's what I can't see!" Not a
glimmer has yet reached such a man that his power
to see this will be the measure of his progress; that
business leaders have largely developed their
strength through hewing their own paths, and
through just such a dark maze as he himself faces.
Of his illusions, the very first, however, to be
shattered is in regard to the loyalty he has assumed
existed and to which he has so often heard glowing
reference. In a huge modern business enterprise,
men are attached or disaffected according as they
consider themselves to have been well or unfairly
treated by the nebulous aggregation that goes by
the name of "the company." And a large proportion
of men, even in the most competently administered
corporations, consider themselves to have met some-
thing less than their due.
One way to lessen early shocks, with their con-
comitant disasters, is for the college man to enter
Big Business forewarned. It is perhaps too much
to ask of Big Business that it should tear away its
own veils. But why not more accurate information
from those who point the way to the business field?
And it would help, of course, if Big Business itself
could furnish more ranking executives willing to
give the college man practical aid while he is pass-
ing through this stage. I used sometimes to ask a
certain executive, at once rarely mellow and of most
distinguished attainments, if he would not talk to
this or that young college or technical man, utterly
disheartened in regard to his future. And to ob-
serve the bearing of the college man after the inter-
view was to know that many anxious questions had
been satisfactorily answered. A Big Brothers As-
sociation as a part of Big Business would. I fancy,
pay dividends.
The most serious indictment the college man
brings against Big Business in its present stage of
development, that the men who have shaped Big
Business have themselves been shaped into forms
he wishes to escape, is one to which any facile reply
is more certain to bring silence than conviction.
During his first year or so in business, the college
man is still keenly sensitive to human values, not
easily taken in by mere outward importance. Fur-
thermore, however platitudinous the suggestion
that reverence for their elders merely on the score
of their age is entirely lacking in the young people
of today, it has definite bearing. Neither dad nor
the president of a billion-dollar combine escapes the
clear-eyed scrutiny of the young college man of
this era. Whatever may be true twenty years later,
during his first year in 'business he examines its
leaders, their views and their ways, with detach-
ment and frequently with distaste. "If this—" he
says. "Well, I wonder—"
But has the college man sufficiently considered
that, unlike most of his elders, he himself has been
taken up into the high places, whence he could look
off and see something of the pattern? Has he dis-
cerned that the authors of "Business is Business"
missed his own early unclouded chance to perceive
that Business is Life? It would be a pity if the
college man. with his broad outlook, and Big Busi-

"But there is no adventure in Big Business," the

tainty."
On the contrary, there is no certainty at all, but
a heroic hazard for the man who is determined that,
if it shapes, it shall not misshape him. And if he de-
cides to take a hand in reshaping Big Business it-
self, as it exists today,—the product of the older
generation, who laid its foundations and reared its
walls,—he will find, I make bold to predict, play
for all the inventiveness, the courage, the endur-
ance, that has gone at any time into human achieve-

for the corresponding paraffin hydrocarbons.
5. Is exceedingly rapid for ether.
It is well known that the aromatic hydrocarbons
do not knock in internal combustion engines so
readily as do the paraffin hydrocarbons. When
these data are interpreted with this fact in mind, it
is evident that the rate of rise of pressure in a pro-
gressive homogeneous explosion as occurs in a bomb
cannot be the sole factor determining the tendency
of a fuel to detonate in an internal combustion en-
gine. The same conclusion is suggested by data
previously reported on the effect of initial temper-
ature on the rate of rise of pressure.
In 1921 Woodbury, Lewis and Canby9 suggested
that the engine knock might be due to some form
of auto-ignition of the unburned explosive mixture
ahead of the flame initiated by the spark. If this
suggestion is correct, the intensity of the knock
would vary directly with the amount of unburned
gas ahead of the flame when the auto-ignition tem-
perature of the unburned gas was reached.
As the unburned gas ahead of the flame is heated
largely by adiabatic compression due to the ex-
pansion of the burning gas, the amount of unburned
gas ahead of the flame when the auto-ignition tem-
perature is reached varies directly with the rate of
expansion pf the burning mixture. The rate of ex-
pansion depends directly upon the rate of rise of
pressure. Therefore, the amount of unburned gas
ahead of the flame when the auto-ignition temper-
ature is reached varies directly with the rate of rise
of pressure of the explosive mixture.
The amount of unburned gas present when the
auto-ignition temperature is reached will also vary
inversely with the auto-ignition temperature. If the
auto-ignition temperature is high, the gas will have
to be compressed to a greater degree before this
temperature is reached.
In Table II the maximum rate of rise of pressure
is given in column 2 and the auto-ignition temper-
ature on the absolute scale as determined by
Moore10 is given in column 3. Column 4, obtained
by dividing column 2 by column 3, represents the
estimated knocking tendency of these fuels based
upon the theory just outlined. The highest useful
compression ratio for these fuels as determined by
Ricardo11 is given in column 5. As the knocking
tendency varies inversely as the highest useful com-
pression ratio, it should be possible to estimate the
highest useful compression ratio of any fuel by
using the inverse ratio of the data given in column
4 with the highest useful compression of one fuel.
The highest useful compression ratio estimated in
this way using the ratio 7 for toluene as a basis of
comparison is given in column 6.

°Pre-ignition occurred before audible detonation.
Although the estimated highest useful compres-
sion ratio is not in absolute agreement with the
ratio determined by Ricardo, considering the dif-
ferent sources and purity of the fuels used and the
assumption of the simple relation between rate ot
rise of pressure and auto-ignition temperature, th»^
agreement between the estimated and experimen-
tally determined values is surprisingly good and
justifies the hypothesis that the tendency of fuels
to knock in internal combustion engines is largely
determined by the rate of rise of pressure and the
auto-igniti&lt; &gt;n temperature.
The important effect of hot surfaces on engine
knocking is further evidence justifying the hypothe-
sis that the knock is due to the auto-ignition of the
unburned part of the mixture that is compressed
against the hot surfaces by the progressive reaction
initiated by the spark. Extensive work on airplane
engines at the government factory at Philadelphia
has shown that the pistons failed at that part of the
combustion chamber furthest removed from the
spark plug indicating that the intense combustion
accompanying the high rate of rise of pressure oc-
curs only in that part of the mixture compressed
against that part of the combustion chamber op-
posite the spark plug. When two spark plugs are
used at opposite sides of the combustion chamber
the pistons fail in the center and the knocking is
more intense. These facts indicate that the ex-
tremely rapid compression of the gases in the cen-
tral part of the combustion chamber due to the in-
itiation of two explosions from opposite sides in-
tensifies the knock.
This hypothesis is adequate to explain all of the
known facts of engine knock. As an airplane rises,
the engine knock decreases. This is due to the fact
that the pressure at the higher altitudes than at sea
level and the rate of rise of pressure is decreased
due to the lower initial pressure. It has been shown
that tetraethyl lead decreases the rate of rise of
pressure in bomb explosion. This fact is adequate
to explain the effect of tetraethyl lead in decreasing
engine knock.

ship's keel. On either side of the cat-walk one sees
at intervals the large ballast bags containing water,
from the valves of which, wires lead forward to
the control cabin. Toward the stern located within
the ship's outer hull and reached by means of the
cat-walk are the crew's quarters. In tiny compart-
ments on each side the men sleep and eat during
flight.
Amidships a shaft leads directly up to the top of
the dirigible. Narrow gang-ways lead off from
either side of the cat-walk to the ladders leading
down to the power cars.
There is also an emergency control board along
the cat-walk.
Final preparations for the departure of the great
ship began at 3 p. m. Friday. The ground crew oi
30 men which was to handle the stern of the ship
as she un-moored was instructed as to its duties.
A tail drag consisting of a long cable attached to
a pair of large weighted wheels was used to keep
the tail of the ship down as she swayed at her
anchor. As the ship swung back and forth about
the mast the wheels rolled to and from along the
ground following the course of the stern. The
crew of the dirigible had re-boarded ship at 3:28
p. m. and a detail of m',-n stood ready to pry the
nose of the craft loose from the mooring mast.
Just prior to the casting off, a second rope was
dropped from the stern and passed through a
snatch block held fast by a spider web of ropes in
the hands of part of the ground crew. The rest of
the ground crew clung to this second rope forming
an auxiliarv "movable" anchor as the order to drop
the original tail drag was given. A few moments
later an order was heard from the control car to
drop the second stern rope and with its nose re-
leased the ship floated clear of the mast. An in-
stant later the order to start the motors was given
and the super-dirigible swung away towards De-
troit at 3:42 p. m.
After circling over the city in a wide sweep the
Los Angeles soared back over the Ford Airport for
a last goodbye before departing for its home base
at Lakehurst. As it passed over the airport the
radio operator at the mast received a message of
thanks from Lieutenant-Commander Rosendahl for
the treatment he and his men received during their
short stay.

and thence to Lakehurst.
Word was received that the Los Angeles had
reached Lakehurst safely at 5:35 a. m. on Satur-
day, October In, having completed the return jour-
ney in slightly under 1 + hours without a mishap.

supplied vibration. The sheet of pulp, beginning to
take form but still far too fragile to bear its own
weight, passes on between two rolls covered with
felt which do the work of the old "couch" and is
then carried on an endless belt of moist felt be-
tween two metal rolls called the "first press rolls,"
which squeeze out most of the remaining water.
give more firmness to the fabric, smooth the upper
surface, then deliver it to another felt carrier which
carries it under and to the back of the "second
press rolls" so that it passes through them with
the upper surface now uppermost.
By this time the web of paper has acquired suf-
ficient toughness so that the felt carrier is no
longer required, and it passes alone through the
drying cylinders (hollow and heated by steam)
which may vary in number from twelve to fifty ac-
cording to the weight of the paper and the conse-
quent time and heat required for drying it. From
the drying rollers it passes to the "calendars,,' hori-
zontal stacks of rollers revolving in contact and
internally heated by steam.
The discovery that paper could be made from
wood-pulp created an allied but almost separate
industry. The wood—principally poplar and spruce
—is reduced to pulp by three processes (1) the
mechanical, in which it is simply ground to a very
fine dust by immense friction (2) by being reduced
to chips and then boiled under pressure in a strong
solution of caustic soda or sulphate of scda or (3)
by being chipped and then boiled in lime-water fed
with the fumes of sulphur. The extent to which
this branch of the industry has grown is shown by
the fact that in Michigan alone there are, besides
the fifty-seven paper mills and nine coating mills,
fifteen pulp mills, four ground-wood mills, seven
sulphite mills and four sulphate mills.
Michigan has taken its place among the half-
dozen great paper-producing states of the Union
through the enterprise of its citizens, for there is
no logical connection between the natural re-
sources of the state and the making of paper save
perhaps the abundance of fresh water so necessary
to the industry. As in the east so in Michigan,
water-power was used in turning some of the tiny
mills from which the present plants sprang, but in
a very short time these factories had grown to
such size that water-p. ,wer was no longer ade-
quate.
It is interesting to note in this connection that
the pulp industry of the state is already plaving a
large part in the development of the Great Lakes-

St. Lawrence waterway and is likely to play an
even more considerable role in the future. Two
years ago the purchasing department of the Con-
solidated Paper Co. of Monroe, Mich., chartered
the first ocean-going vessel to bring a shipload of
"kraft" pulp from Sweden direct to the Monroe
waterfront, and the undertaking was carried out
without delays and with profit both to the ship-
pers and the paper company.
Kalamazoo and
Monroe — the for-
mer the chief pa-
per-producing cen-
ter of the state and
the latter second to
it in this regard and
first among the cit-
ies of the world in
the production of
paper-board — saw
the first undertak-
ings in paper-mak-
ing at almost ex-
actly the s a m e
time. In Septem-
ber, 1866, Benjamin
F. Lyon came to
Kalamazoo fro m
Fitchburg, Mass.,
and built a small
frame building capable of housing one machine
above a dam which he erected on the waters of
Portage Creek, a small stream flowing into the city
from the south. Here he began the manufacture of
newsprint paper at the same time that another
small mill, located on the banks of the River Raisin
near Monroe, commenced turning out straw paper
-—the old-fashioned "brown paper" in which the
meat used to come from the butcher.
Some idea of the extent and importance of the
industry is given by a few figures on the Kala-
mazoo Valley mills. The twenty-seven paper-mak-
ing and nine coating mills of this district operate
fifty-four paper-making and 104 coating machines,
turning out 525,000 tons annually, this output in-
cluding practically all kinds of paper except news-
alum, clay, soda ash, bleach, size, soda pulp, satin
white, casein, borax, starch, colors, glue, lumber,
twine and nails, the last three items used in
packing1,
The mere black and white facts concerning any
of our great industries are cold things at best un-
less supplemented by an actual sight of some of
the operations. The statement that a certain num-
ber of tons of "brown paper" for the making o."
strawboard comes
out of a large brick
building every day
fails to stir the im-
agination, but fif-
teen minutes in the
building create a
very different ef-
fect. At one end
freight cars are un-
loading bales o f
straw in a shed al-
most big enough to
serve as hangar for
the "Los Angeles."
Men armed with
hooks and pitch-
forks tear the wires
off the bales and
pitch them on to an
endless carrier —
and that is the one and only time that the material
is touched by human hands until it emerges in great
rolls of paper at the far end of the building. The
first sections of the great building are hot and
steamy, where the straw is being reduced to pulp
in the cookers, great spherical boilers as big as a
four-room bungalow, noisier where the steaming
stuff is being put through the cone-shaped crush-
ing and shredding machine, and then astonishingly
quiet out where the huge Fourdrinier, over one
hundred and fifty feet in length, is performing its
endless miracle of transformation. One expects
crowds of workmen, but they are not there; only
a pitifully small crew of men reading newspapers
and yawning. That is all they do until the paper
breaks, then thev crowd into ten hectic minutes.

the different concerns aggregate over $55,000,000.
Such a gigantic industry naturally demands im-
mense shipments of raw material from outside, and
the figures — dealing only with the Kalamazoo
group — arc far more impressive than the bare
statement. The mills require 575.000 tons of coal

other period of watchful loafing.
Reading these figures and considering the num-
ber of paper-making and allied mills in the state
gives some idea of the industry's dimension.
That Michigan ranks well among the first half-
dozen paper-producing states of the Union is to
store away a dry fact soon forgotten; to watch a
bit of the truth in actual operation is to remember
the fact vividlv for all time.

GAS REFRIGERATION
(Continued from page 16)
quently adapted for use with gas as the source of
heat.
The production of refrigeration by the direct use
of heat by means of the absorption system will now
be briefly described.
If ammonia vapor is brought into intimate con-
tact with water, the water has the ability to absorb
a great many times its own volume of ammonia
vapor. If after being allowed to absorb all of the
ammonia vapor possible this solution or so-called
"strong liquor" is now heated up to the boiling-
point, nearly all of the absorbed ammonia vapor
will be expelled from the "strong liquor" and it will
then be known as "weak liquor." It is these nut-
standing characteristics of ammonia vapor and
water that make the absorption machine possible
and we will see next how they are made use of in
the actual machine.
The production of refrigeration in any type of
refrigerating plant using ammonia is to have a
stored supply of liquid ammonia at a high pressure
and at ordinary temperature and to allow this to
flow through a valve into a so-called "expansion-
coil," where the pressure is maintained much lower.
This reduction of pressure in the expansion-coil to-
gether with an absorption of heat causes the liquid
ammonia to boil at a low temperature and to pass
from ammonia liquid into ammonia vapor. This
conversion from the liquid to the vapor state re-
quires the absorption of a large amount of heat and
this heat comes from either the brine surrounding
the expansion-coil or from the air in which the ex-
pansion-coil may be suspended. This heat origi-
nally comes from the articles and space to be re-
frigerated as well as leakage of heat from the out-
side inward.
The simplest refrigerating system would consist
of a tank of liquid ammonia, an expansion-coil
vented to atmosphere, and a valve for controlling
the rate of flow of the liquid ammonia from the
supply tank to the expansion-coil. -This is not a
practical method because it would waste the refrig-
erant and result in a prohibitive cost; the ammonia
vapor is dangerous and offensive and therefore can-
not be allowed to escape and the supply of am-
monia would have to be replenished continually.
Some method must, therefore, be employed t» re-
claim this ammonia vapor after it passes from the
expansion-coil and convert it back to liquid am-
monia and restore it to the .immonia receiver, from
there to again flow into the expansion-coil, vaporize
and produce the required refrigerating effect.
The only way to convert this ammonia vapor
back into the liquid ammonia and restore it to the
ammonia receiver is to compress it to a higher pres-
sure and temperature and cool it.
In the compression system the compressor com-
presses the ammonia vapor to the required high
pressure and from the compressor the vapor passes
to a condenser of either an air-cooled or water-
cooled type where the ammonia is cooled and re-
verts to liquid ammonia again. From the ammonia
condenser the liquid ammonia flows to the am-
monia receiver. As long as the compressor and
condenser are in operation this process is a con-
tinuous one.
THE "COMMON SENSE" ABSORPTION TYPE HOUSEHOLD
ICE MACHINE. MANUFACTURED BY COMMON SENSE
ICE MACHINE CO., i844 WEST i4th ST., CHICAGO. ILL.
Ill the absorption system the ammonia vapor
passes from the expansion-coil into a tank contain-
ing water and known as the "absorber-generator."
The ammonia vapor is readily absorbed by the
water, with which it is brought into intimate con-
tact, until it has absorbed a large quantity of
ammonia. During this part of the process the "ab-
sorber-generator" has been functioning as an "ab-
sorber." When ammonia vapor is absorbed by
water, a large amount of heat is generated which
would soon heat up the water in the absorber to the
boiling-point and absorption would soon cease.
Therefore during this absorption proces.s water is
kept circulating through a cooling-coil which is sub-
merged in the ammonia anil water solution in the
absorber, thus keeping it cool and allowing the ab-
sorption of enormous quantities of ammonia vapor.
Finally the time comes when the water in the ab-
sorber can absorb no more ammonia vapor and the
refrigerating process stops.
It now becomes necessary to expel the ammonia
vapor from the strong-liquor in the absorber, con-
dense it to a liquid, and restore it to the liquid am-
monia receiver. This is done as follows:
The pipe connecting the absorber to the expan-
sion-coil is now closed by means of a valve and
another valve is opened in a pipe which connects

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the absorber with the ammonia condenser; the
water flowing in the cooling-coil in the absorber
is cut off and the gas is turned on to the burner
and ignited. This gas flame is in contact, externally,
with the portion of the absorber having the strong-
liquor in contact with it. The "absorber-generator"
has now ceased to function as an "absorber" and is
now functioning as a "generator."
This application of heat to the "strong-liquor"
produces a rise in temperature and pressure and
causes an expulsion of nearly all of the absorbed
ammonia which flows through a rectifier and into
the ammonia condenser where it is condensed back
to liquid ammonia and from which it flows into the
ammonia receiver. Water-vapor is released along
with the ammonia vapor and would pass over to
the receiver with the liquid ammonia, thereby di-
luting it and greatly impairing its effectiveness as
a refrigerant were it not for the rectifier. The rec-
tifier is, or is the equivalent of, a small condenser
in series with the main ammonia condenser through
which the mingled ammonia vapor and water vapor
pass on their way to the main condenser and in
which a large part of the water vapor is condensed
out and flows by gravity back into the generator.
The rectifier does not and cannot entirely remove
the water-vapor but it reduces its amount to a
point where it does not interfere very seriously
with the operation of the machine.
After nearly the entire amount of absorbed am-
monia vapor has been expelled from the water dur-
ing the heating process, the gas supply to the
burner is cut off; the valve is closed in the pipe
connecting the generator with the ammonia con-
denser; the valve is opened in the pipe connecting
the expansion-coil to the generator and the water
is again turned on to the cooling-coil submerged in
the weak-liquor in the generator. The "absorber-
generator" has now ceased to function as a "gen-
erator" and is again functioning as an "absorber."
As soon as the water in the cooling-coil in the ab-
sorber has cooled the weak-liquor sufficiently, the
refrigerating process again starts.
It should be noted that during the "generating"
portion of this cycle no refrigeration is being pro-
duced. However, the time required for generation
is usually very much shorter than the time during
which refrigeration is being produced. The above
described operations during the cycle are carried
out automatically in the actual machines and this
cycle is known as an "intermittent cycle," because
refrigeration is not continuous, it being stopped
during the "generating" portion of the cycle.
It is possible to build a refrigerating machine of
the absorption type which operates on a "contin-
uous cycle." The Platen-Munters machine is a
machine of the "continuous cycle" type. It has no
moving mechanical parts of any kind; is hermeti-
cally sealed, and is absolutely silent in operation.
All one sees is a small gas flame in one part of the
machine and a coating of ice in another part. The
"continuous cycle" machines at first sight have
many outstanding advantages over the "intermit-
tent cycle" machines. Their chief advantages are:
absence of moving parts and the fact that they do
not leave the refrigerated space without any re-
frigerating effect for any interval such as is done
by machines of the "intermittent cycle" type during
the "generating" period of the cycle.
However, a closer study of the application and
design possibilities of machines of the "intermittent
cycle" type will show they are capable of producing
very good results. Two machines of this class are
on the market at the present time, namely the
"Sorco" and the "Common Sense Ice Machine."
Many other refrigerating machines of the gas-
fired, absorption, household type are now being de-
veloped and the coming year will undoubtedly see
some new and interesting designs placed on the
market.
Having discussed the operation of the actual ab-
sorption machine, the next thing of importance is
to know how their first cost compares with a ma-
chine of the compression type, what operating ad-
vantages they may have, if any, and how their cost
of operation compares with that of electrically op-
erated household machines of the compression type.
It must be understood that the comparisons fol-
lowing are based on the assumption of a gas-fired
absorption machine and an electric motor driven
compression machine, each machine to produce re-
frigeration at the same rate and under the same
conditions.
On the basis of first cost the absorption machine
can be built at less expense than the compression
machine.
Absorption machines can be built with no mov-
ing parts, can be hermetically sealed, are entirely
silent in operation, and cost little for repairs.
In discussing the cost of operation of the absorp-
tion versus the compression machine, let us con-
sider one kilowatt-hour of electrical energy ex-
pended in the electric motor of the compression
plant and one kilowatt-hour expended in a resist-
ance heating unit which we will assume for the
moment has replaced the gas burner on the absorp-
tion machine. Incidentally it is well to state here
that it is immaterial as to what the source of heat
for an absorption machine is. It may be gas, elec-
tricity, oil, coal, steam or any other controllable
source of heat. Under these conditions one kilo-
watt-hour will produce much more refrigeration in
the case of the compression machine than it will in
the case of the absorption machine.


Page 31
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Next consider one dollar spent for gas which is
used to heat the absorption machine and one dollar
spent for electricity to operate the electric motor of
the compression machine.
In this case the absorption machine will deliver
much more refrigeration for the dollar spent for
gas than will the compression machine for the dol-
lar spent for electricity.
The future of refrigeration with gas is unlimited,
and taken in connection with gas house-heating
forms a combined problem of tremendous engineer-
ing, manufacturing and commercial importance.
After all, refrigeration is nothing but the reduc-
tion of the average velocity of the molecules of a
body; the greater this reduction of the velocity, the
greater the refrigerating effect produced. The broad
question is whether or not there may be more direct
and simple methods for reducing molecular velocity
than by our present roundabout methods. If there
are other and simpler methods by which refriger-
ation may be produced, their commercial develop-
ment will be a thing of the greatest importance.
There is in fact a considerable amount of research
going on in the scientific world with this object in
view, and some small progress in this direction has
been made.
There is no doubt but that the application and
use of illuminating gas for the production of house-
hold refrigeration will make rapid strides and offer
many opportunities to those interested.
ART OF THE PLASTERER
(Conttnued from page 21)
in English homes in the early part of seventeenth
century. In some of these designs the use of the
tool is very noticeable in the lining of the petals
and roses. It is also evident in the concave nature
of the petals and leafage. The chief characteristic
of this period was the interlacing and intertwisting
of narrow flat bands and scrolls studded with tiny
rosettes, pyramids, dices, and pelettes. Symmetry
of form and balance invariably predominated. The
panels were usually large and well filled. A good
example of this may be seen in Audley End, Beck-
ington Abbey and Sommerset.
During Charles I's reign the design remained
much the same but towards the latter part the in-
fluence of Reubens was noticeable. The ceiling was
divided into six rectangular panels by cornice and
strap solTited beams.
From England the craft of the plasterer spread
to Scotland. About the sixteenth century the
Scotch abandoned their fortress-like homes and the
spirit of relaxation and security was felt in their
architecture. The departure from the hall and dun-
geon to the more spacious drawing rooms, galleries
and libraries was the dominant characteristic of this
period. Nearly all of the plaster work done in Scot-
land, with a few exceptions, is of the typical seven-
teenth century style. As in England the earlier
Scottish ceilings were made up of single moulded
ribs with enriched bands and panel decoration.
Simple moulded cornices and quaint ornaments such
os thistles, roses, lions and other heraldic forms
were freely introduced. The panels were usually
filled with floral patterns and sprays of ornament.
The ribs displayed a wide variety of treatment,
some narrow and moulded, others wider and flatter
and still others with enriched ribs combined with
mouldings on either side of simple form or elabo-
rate detail. At a later period the character of the
work became heavier. Some of the ribs were "run"
by the eye, others were rigidly guided by a rod.
This latter period also revealed the casting of orna-
ment from moulds as compared with the old meth-
od of modeling the raw plaster by hand or with
the fingers.
Much of this work in Scotland was executed and
influenced by Italian and Flemish artists. As the
demand for ornament grew the workmen aban-
doned the earlier laborious process of designing the
detail directly on the ceiling while the plaster was
still in a soft condition, and universally yielded to
the speedier method of applying the already cast
form after the material has hardened. At first the
ornament was simple, but later on the enrichment
of detail became heavier and more deeply undercut
in the setting of fruit and leafage and was largely
modeled by hand.
A little later there was introduced in England an
entirely new conception of plaster work for ceilings.
The time of the independent craftsman or master
builder had passed and all work was under the
direct supervision of an architect. Inigo Jones was
the first authorized architect in the profession in
England. His influence was keenly noticeable in
England during the early part of the seventeenth
century. Me employed the use of moulded ribs of
much greater size, of panels with a much simpler
design and greater dimensions than had formerly
been used. Some of his best examples are found in
the ceilings of the Wilton House near Salisbury,
Ashburnham House, Little Dean's Yard, Westmin-
ster and at the Coleshill House in Berkshire, which
was built in 1650 and was one of Jones' most per-
fect works.
Following Jones was Sir Christopher Wren, an-
other "professional" architect. Wren, however, was
fortunate in securing the services of Gibbons, a
genius at the craft of plaster and wood carving.
Although Wren was a great architect and showed
great skill in his clever arrangements of vaulting
and arcading, he left the plaster work and orna-
mental designs entirely in the hands of Gibbons.
Perhaps Wren was too busy at the time to super-

\ise all the details. Consequently the decoration
was inferior and lacked the architectural character
that the works of Wren demanded to make a well
balanced piece of design. Much of the detail that
was employed in his layouts was a direct copy of
French and Italian art. Nevertheless, Gibbons was
n master at the art and although some of his work
did not harmonize with Wren's architecture the
designs that he worked out showed intelligence and
mastery with the medium at his disposal.
Soon after Wren's death plaster work deterio-
rated rapidly in England. The architects and plas-
terers that followed w e r e incompetent. Some
attempted to imitate Gibbons' work, but in doing
so only demonstrated their inferiority. They en-
deavored to enrich their cornices with lavish detail
but only displayed decoration of lifeless and mean-
ingless ornament, which was in great contrast to
Wren's work and his associate, Gibbons, where
-.•very member was carefully disposed of in such
good effect. The ornament of such men as Kent
and Campbell who followed Wren was utterly me-
chanical and denuded of any distinctive character.
This was the result primarily of the fact that they
adhered strictly to books and mechanical methods
and the practical man who understood the behav-
iour of the material was sadly neglected. For ex-
ample, a stock moulding was inserted whether it
were designed to be placed at a distance of six feet
or sixty from the observer. Stucco work had fallen
to its lowest ebb and practically came to an end.
At this time a new substitute was introduced for
plaster by the Adams Brothers. This material was
a mixture of dead plaster or gypsum or some fibre
with a glutinous compound modeled in lowest re-
lief and produced while being pressed hot into
metal moulds. The ceiling decoration was graceful
and refined in design, delicate and subtle in model-
ing though somewhat feeble in relief. Most of their
work was borrowed from buildings that they had
studied while traveling through France and Italy.
Modern plaster work is a total rejuvenation of
the craft in almost every respect. The material in
general use is much softer, being composed of plas-
ter of Paris and fibre. The method of applying the
cast moulds to the ceiling is also different. The
highly organized labor unions, high scale of wages
and the ultimate in mind to do the best possible
thing in the shortest possible time has led to the
custom of screwing the mouldings in place. How-
ever, there has been a strong tendency to duplicate
the old designs but the material employed at the
present time, being of a softer texture has been
misused by attempting to make it take the sharp,
strong undercutting of the older harder stuff. The
mechanical technique is far superior at the present
time to the ancient methods. However, if we were
to judge the quality of the work by comparing an-
cient and modern examples then I should say that
the ancient were superior inasmuch as thev under-
stood the medium in hand. Thus their designs were
fundamentally true and void of methods which
should not be practiced on a material whose one
essential characteristic lies in the method of appli-
cation and not the finished product as a whole.
TRAINING OF ME.\
(Continued from pa^e 23)
tent in the mathematical analysis of engineering-
problems. It happens, as well, that there are cnly
a relatively few who are naturally constituted for
such work. We are finding these few men, and are
training them in the Advanced Course in Engineer-
ing, I shall pass this over merely with the detinitt-
assurance that the future General Electric Com-
pany, which we are now considering, will not Vie
handicapped by a lack of such men.
Consider the question of recruiting. This is. in
my opinion, the most important single feature in
the program. The starting point for all that I have
discirssed is the man. We simply must take advant-
age of every proper means at our disposal to select
and recruit—and these are two very different func-
tions-—the most capable men who are available. We
must first find out as definitely as possible who such
men are at the colleges, and then do our best to ob-
tain them.
But it must not be forgotten that there is another
very important factor in recruiting besides the con-
tacts at the colleges. The opinion which is held by
young men who have had experience in the com-
pany, and which is passed back to their friends at
the colleges, is, after all, the fundamental and the
most powerful factor in recruiting. Responsibility
and recognition of merit are what any wide-awake
young man desires. He craves for an opportunity
to make progress. While a number of them may be
over-ambitious, nevertheless we cannot overlook
the fundamental fact of human nature that to retain
the interest of live young men we must give ade-
quate attention to their desire to have an oppor-
tunity to show what they can do. Thus, we should
keep in mind that we all, day in and clay out, in-
fluence this problem of recruiting in a very definite
way.
The general program for the progressive selection
and training of these engineering graduates extends
over a period of about three and one-half years after
graduation. During this period there is a decided
taper in the number of men who are in flow through
the established courses, this taper being due both to
weeding out and to the selection of men, who, while
enroute, show aptitude and a desire for a particular
line of work. The program is so laid out that each
assignment prepares the student for the next.

The Engineering Hc*cm,cli IiulL'tiux
In the live years which elapsed between October,
1910, when the Department of Engineering Re-
search was established by action of the Board of
Regents, and October, 1925, something like three
hundred research proiects were undertaken by the
newly created department. Not all of these, of
course, produced results demanding publication.
Some of these were of immediate interest only to
the co-operating industry calling for the research.
Some again were of such a nature as to demand
study over a period -of years before it could be
hoped to arrive at conclusions of moment. But it
was increasingly evident that from all this research
activity there were bound to result contributions
to the various fields of technology, engineering,
and pure science which the University should rec-
ogniV.e and publish for the benefit of a larger pub-
lic. Accordingly the Advisory Committee author-
ized the creation of a Publication Committee which
was to organize and direct the work and publica-
tion for the Department of Engineering Research.
The committee, consisting of Professors Sadler
and A. H. White with Professor Nelson of the
English Department as chairman began to work
October. 1925, just a year ago this time. It was
decided to issue a series of research bulletins simi-
lar to those published by the various experiment
stations and research laboratories in this country
and abroad. These bulletins were to be issued at
no stated intervals, but whenever, in the iudgment
of the committee, work had been done by the re-
search department which represented a distinct and
original contribution to the field represented, or
when, in the progress of some large piece of re-
search, an important step had been taken making
a notable development of either the known facts
or the technique of the research. It was also
agreed that from time to time the'publication of
bibliographies, abstracts and digests of the liter-
ature of new fields of investigation might stimulate
and aid research in those fields.
Professor Nelson, who was, ex-officio. the editor
of the new bulletins, was sent to the Universitv of
Illinois to study the publication work of the En-
gineering Experiment Station, which extends over
nearly a quarter of a century. The bulletins of all
similar departments were studied and compared.
Then actual achievements of our own Research
Department during the five years of active service
were carefully considered, and appraised for their
universal values, and, from the wealth &lt; f available
material, the bulletins were planned.
The first bulletin issued in January was an In-
vestigation of Charcoal and Coke Pig Irons, by W.
E. Jominy, Associate Investigator in the Depart-
ment of Engineering Research. It was a study of
the cupola-melted gray iron to determine the effect
of varying the percentages of charcoal and coke
pig irons in the cupola burden. Mr. Jominy had
previously demonstrated that charcoal irons pos-
sess a higher tensile strength, transverse strength
and deflection than coke irons of approximately
the same chemical composition. To make sure that
these qualities of the charcoal iron were not due to
external conditions, but to inherent properties of
the irons themselves, the melting conditions were
made as nearly comparable as possible by melting
in a small ladle-type elcctric-arc furnace. The re-
sults led to the conclusion that there were differ-
ences in these two types of irons not accounted
for by the ordinary chemical analysis.
The conclusions were, of course, based on data
obtained under ideal experimental conditions.
Whether charcoal iron would produce better cast-
ings than coke iron when melted in the ordinary
way in the cupola, remained a question. Bulletin
No. 1 gives an account of the investigation made
possible by the co-operation of the Cadillac Motor
Car Company to determine whether the advantage
in strength found in charcoal iron in electric-fur-
nace melting would persist through cupola-melting
conditions.
The second bulletin issued in February dealt
with Volume Changes in Gypsum Structures Due
to Atmospheric Humidity, by Professor Alfred H.
White. This bulletin reports the results of an in-
vestigation undertaken at the suggestion of the
W. E. Wood Company, which financed the long
and expensive research entailed. It purposed to
determine whether the defect which had appeared
in several monolithic gypsum roofs might be due


November, 1926
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
to the materials used. Gypsum plasters, contrary
to the usual view, expand in damp air and contract
in dry air. These changes continue in full measure
for as many as 220 alternations. The effect of dilu-
ents such as sand has not been investigated, but
with neat gypsum the cyclic changes in length
amount to 0.02 to 0.04 per cent.
In addition to this cyclic variation there is a
progressive shrinkage with successive variations in
atmospheric humidity. Plaster of Paris and other
first settle products show a shrinkage which may
amount to 0.09 per cent after 200 alternations of
humidity. Second-settle products show this shrink-
age in larger measure, and after 60 alternations may
show a shrinkage as great as 0.17 per cent. This
progressive shrinkage may be one cause of cracks
in monolithic gypsum roofs. There is evidence
that recrystallization accompanies these changes in
volume, but there is no satisfactory explanation of
the mechanism of the process.
The third bulletin which appeared in April was
the joint effort of Professor Emsweiler and Mr.
Randall of the Detroit Steel Products Company.
It is entitled, "The Neutral Zone of Ventilation."
The conclusions which it presents are a part of a
research program for the study of ventilation in-
itiated and financed by the Detroit Steel Products
Company—an investigation already in progress for
more than a year. In the course of study the in-
vestigators discovered what is practically a new
concept, that in a room in which the temperature
of the air is different from that outside, there is a
level at which the pressure changes from less to
greater than atmospheric. The authors of the bul-
letin call this the neutral zone. The concept is a
useful and valuable instrument in understanding
and reckoning with the principles underlying the
flow of air due to differences in temperature. Bul-
letin No. 3 represents, therefore, a contribution of
considerable theoretical significance in the design
and calculation of heating and ventilating systems.
The bulletins listed to appear within the next
few months include, A Digest and Biography ot
Stainless Steel by Professor A. E. White and Mr.
Clark; A Theoretical Method of Predicting Day-
light from Windows by Professor H. H. Higbee,
and An Elaborate Study of Metal Cutting by Pro-
fessor O. W. Boston. The bulletins can be secured
by addressing the Department of Engineering Re-
search. —J. Raleigh Nelson.
Tclford Pctric: The Elements of Internal
Combustion Engineering
This book by an English author, gives a very
complete history of the development of internal
combustion engines from the standpoint of types.
The underlying thermodynamic principles for the
various types are very clearly presented. Valuable
data on formation of mixtures is also included.
Unfortunately the examples and problems include
combinations of metric and English units, which
makes them difficult for the American engineering
student to readily understand, but aside from these
the reviewer believes the book to be as clear and
precise a presentation of the elements of internal
combustion engineering as has ever come to his
attention. —C. W. Good.
Micras and Yerbury: lhitch Architecture
of the Twentieth Century
The element of novelty in a work of architecture
is a feeble claim to greatness, but sound design
done in a fresh way finds an eager audience. Re-
cent Dutch architecture embodies just this latter
quality. The book is largely one of excellent
plates, but a brief text indicates the setting and
the results to date in the modern Dutch move-
ment.
The earlier work of the century shows the re-
turn to an architecture frankly of brick, a material
traditionally Dutch. In the work of the later men,
of whom De Klerk is an outstanding example, de-
sign is handled with the new freedom that steel
and concrete permit; brick becomes purely a deco-
rative sheathing. Some of the exhibits are bizarre,
but rarely, and, in comparison with many Gefman
examples, all are restrained. In the general char-
acter of the work of Oud, Kramer and others there
is more than a slight resemblance to the work of
our own Sullivan and Wright.
—Wells Bennett.
Ranil M. d'Hurcourt: Le* Tixsus Indians
du Yieux Perou
A worth-while addition to our large collection of
illustrated books on fabrics and their design.
These fine plates in color are of interest to the
student, the artist and the practicing architect for
the presentation of Peruvian motifs in color.
—Wells Bennett.
Gabriel Faure: Gardens of Rome
A very readable presentation of the romantic
charm of Rome. The text, illustrated by Franck
Kemp, weaves the story of ancient, medieval and
renaissance Rome most attractively. There are
many illustrations in color from water colors done
quite in the style of the architectural renderer.
There are also numerous reproductions from pho-
tographs. —Wells Bennett.

Engines of High Output is the title of a new
book by the well known English engineer, Harry
R. Ricardo, B. A. This book is published by JVTac-
Dougal and Evans of London.
The aim of the author is evidently to present in
as abridged a manner as possible the present status
of the high speed internal combustion engine as
applied to automotive service. The book aims to
give an average reader some insight into the ad-
vantages and limitations of this type of engine
from both the theoretical and practical side.
Many topics of importance arc discussed in the
same clear manner in which they are treated in a
more general and complete treatise on this subject
by the same author although of course the discus-
sion is not so detailed nor accompanied by so com-
plete a mass of supporting facts as appear in his
more complete works.
To give an adequate review of this new book
would be almost like writing it and any one inter-
ested in this subject will find the 105 pages of this
little book most profitable and interesting reading.
—Hugh E. Keeler.
TRAINING OF MEN
(Continued from page 32)
During the first year they are on Test. Here they
receive a training and experience in the operation of
machines and in shouldering direct and important
responsibility that I believe cannot be matched
anywhere in the world. Paralleling this, they may
take what we call the General Course—200 enrolled
last year-—in which the habit of stud}', acquired in
college, may be continued. Classes meet two even-
ings each week for a two-hour period. One evening
is devoted to engineering, covering the character-
istics of apparatus and problems in engineering ap-
plication. The other is devoted to business subjects,
including the principles of finance, marketing, ac-
counting, and production. The students are care-
fullv watched and rated on their work both on Test
and in the classes, and these records form a basis
for selection.
In the second year (it may, of course, be some-
what later), those who have been selected enter
some Designing Engineering Department on the
Departmental Plan. Here they do actual engineer-
ing work as members of the particular department.
This practical engineering experience is to be paral-
leled by systematic study of design principles and
other important matters relating to the production
of the apparatus. Then, in order that each student
may obtain an idea of the general aspects of de-
signing engineering, regardless of the department
he is in, there will be a few meetings of the entire
second year group for the purpose of discussing
such matters. Just as the first year's work pre-
pared the student to take designing engineering,
and afforded a basis for selection, so the second
year affords a preparation for application engineer-
ing, and a basis for determining who, among those
who wish to pass on, arc competent to do so.
In the third year, the plan is the same as for the
second, except that the men are now in Commer-
cial Engineering (i.e., application engineering) De-
partments. They will have the benefit of sys-
tematic study and group meetings just as in the
second year. Those who have made good will
comprise the personnel from whom it is planned,
in the main, to sustain our Commercial Engineer-
ing Departments, to recruit an appropriate portion
of our future commercial representatives, and to
supply our customers with trained engineers.
Those who may be selected for commercial work
enter the General Office Commercial Department
for a few months' experience before going to the
district. During this period it is planned to have
these men take the Sales Training Course.
That is the general plan. While not quite all of
it is now in effect, the fundamental features and a
significant portion of the main structure of a com-
prehensive selection and training system to guard
our future now exists, and the details of the de-
finitely planned superstructure are being added as
fast as circumstances will permit.
MODERNISM VERSUS TRADITION
(Continued from page 24)
have been gradually developed and handed down
through thousands of years. It seems to be in the
effort to produce good ornament and detail in gen-
eral that the man who cuts loose from traditional
sources of inspiration fails most seriously.
Somewhere between ultra-conservatism and rad-
icalism, undoubtedly lies the solution which men all
over this country are trying to find and follow and
it is very interesting to observe the gradual trend
which our American architecture is taking in a very
fine conservative semi-modern stvle.

Locontotirc
On October 11, one of the new type oil-electric
switching locomotives passed through Ann Arbor
over the Michigan Central tracks enroute to Chi-
cago. This is the second of these locomotives pur-
chased by the Chicago and North Western System
to replace steam engines at the congested pier dis-
trict.
The locomotive is the joint product of the Inger-
soll-Rand, American Locomotive and General Elec-
tric companies. It is of 60-ton size and is driven and
controlled similarly to an electric locomotive. There
is a 600-horsepower Diesel engine which drives di-
rectly a generator, mounted in the cab. The cur-
rent from the generator drives the motors geared
to the axles. The engine burns oil for fuel and is
automatically governed. The circulating water is
cooled by a radiator on the roof. The running costs
are most economical, being from thirty to forty dol-
lars a day as against from eighty to a hundred for
a steam locomotive.
The officials of the Michigan Central invited the
students and members of the faculty to inspect and
ride in the engine and very kindly held it over for
an hour at the station while about three hundred
students and faculty members examined the loco-
motive.

Echoes from the Graduates
PROFESSOR HENRY CLAY ANDERSON
Head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering
AS a fitting biography for the opening number
of the Technic, there could be nothing more
suitable than to present to the students of the engi-
neering college the life of a man who is at the head
of one of the departments of their school. It has
been the practice for some
few years to present in each
issue of the Technic the life of
some "Son of Michigan" who
has made good or some man
who has spent his life making
the University of Michigan the
great outstanding exponent of
education that it is today.
Professor Henry C. Ander-
son, B. M. E., head of the de-
partment of Mechanical Engi-
neering, is one of the latter
men. His connection with the
University of Michigan dates
from 1900, when he came here
to take a position as instruc-
tor of Mechanical Engineering.
His twenty-six years of effort
spent in connection with those
of Dean Mortimer E. Cooley,
Professor Sadler, and Profes-
sor Riggs have built up this
great College of Engineering
which ranks with the finest in
the world. There is not room here to give an in-
timate history of the development of the College
of Engineering, but if you will avail yourself of the
opportunity of knowing these men further than we
can present them here, they may tell you many
things about the "Good Old Days" that may be of
a surprising nature. For instance, the story of the
designing of the building now called the West En-
gineering Building. How many of you readers
know that because of a dispute with Dean Greene
over the construction of the new building, these
four men and another now gone, started in to work
PROF. HENRY C. ANDERSON
one Saturday night and the next Monday morning
presented a complete set of preliminary plans, from
-.vhich the building was built as it stands today,
with the exception of a one-hundred foot addition
on the north end? There are many more such
stories, but we are here con-
cerned with the life of one of
the characters.
Professor Henrv C. Ander-
son is from Kentucky, where.
Dean Cooley says, "The grass
is blue, and they grow real
men and fast horses." He was
born at Morganfield in 1872.
and attended the Morganfield
Academy and the University
of Kentucky, from which he
graduated in 1897 with the de-
gree of Bachelor of Mechan-
ical Engineering. He went to
work immediately for the Cin-
cinnati Rail w a y Company,
starting at the very bottom
and working his way up to As-
sistant to the Master Mechanic
in three years. In 1900 he
c a in e to the University of
Michigan as an instructor of
Mechanical Engineering. He
was made an Assistant Pro-
fessor of Mechanical Engineering in 1903, and a
junior Professor three years later. In 1912 he was
made a full Professor of Steam Engineering and
in 1917, Professor of Mechanical Engineering and
head of that department, which position he holds
today.
Separate from his great work here at the Uni-
versity, he was a member of a linn of consulting
engineers, engaged in mechanical and electrical en-
gineering in various parts of Michigan and vicinity
from 190d to 1914. During that time he personallv
had charge of the designing and construction of


Page 39

many large power plants and heating plants.
But perhaps his greatest work has been his steam
and electric railway appraisals. \\ orking for the
most part in connection with Dean Coolcy and Pro-
fessor Riggs. he has performed invaluable work
ever since his connection with the University. So
\vell have these men done their work that they have
become the authority, in this part of the country,
on steam and electric railway appraisal work. They
have appraised the steam railways of the state of
Michigan three times, and more than 2,200 miles
of railway system for the Fere Marquctte in the
United States and Canada. They have made a com-
plete inventory of West Shore Lines in the city of
Kingston, N. J., for the Ulster and Delaware Rail-
way and the Public Service Railroad of New Jer-
sey. Over 800 miles of system has been appraised
for the Detroit United Railway on two different
occasions, and numerous power plants and power
transmission properties in and around about De-
troit, for the state, by these men. These few ex-
amples and an unending list of others, gas plants,
heating plants, hospitals, and all manner of public
works just tend to further show to us the great
value of the knowledge and the experience of these
men.
Here at Michigan we are indeed fortunate to
have such men on our teaching faculty. Too often
these men who have climbed out on top, are not
available for personal acquaintance and the story
of their successes seems rather like a myth, but
Professor Anderson and his associates are right
here on the campus.
It is true, he is busy a great deal of the time for
the charges the school work puts on him are very
heavy, but make a little sacrifice of your time and
come to know such men as he. Their sound advice
and knowledge are invaluable to the student, espe-
cially in the part of the university training that is
not included in the curriculum, but which we must
all learn.
Professor Anderson has been connected with the
Michigan Technic and the Engineering Society for
many years. He is one of the board of directors of
the Michigan Union and was a member of the com-
mittee that investigated the financial conditions
here last year. Professor Anderson is one of our
stoutest faculty defenders of the honor system.
In writing this brief review of the life and work
of Professor Anderson it has been difficult to sepa-
rate his work from that of his associates here on
the campus, Dean Cooley and Professor Riggs, be-
cause their work has been all so tireless and con-
structive for Michigan. We students and alumni
owe to these men homage for the things that Michi-
gan means to us. Learn to know and respect them
for the things that they know, the things that they
have done and are doing for ourselves and our
college.

How the Department of Engineering Research
of the University of Michigan Serves
the Industries of the State
MANUFACTURING errors
are costly because under
quantity production methods they
are often duplicated thousands of
times before discovery.
Adequate research facilities, such
as those provided by the Depart-
ment of Engineering Research of
the University of Michigan, may
be the means of saving your own
business from expensive and avoid'
able mistakes.
A few hundred dollars spent on
investigation, aided by the splen-
did equipment and personnel of
the University, may return its cost
a hundred-fold.
The Department of Engineering
Research does not compete with
commercial laboratories. It is
operated as a genuine helpful
service to Michigan industries.
The University places at the dis-
posal of interested companies and
mdividuals: The services of trained
workers, special laboratories, com-
plete, testing equipment and ex-
ceptional library facilities.
Actual cost of labor and material
plus a nominal service fee, con-
stitutes the only charge. The
University undertakes only such
problems as require fundamental
research and give promise of defin-
ite solution.

THREE GENERATIONS
By F. W. WILLARD, '06E
YOUR Editor suggested that 1 tell how large
industrial organizations select college men and
induct them into the esoterics of business.
The engineering faculties
know more about such myster-
ies so I respectfully refer you to
them. They also know more
about you and should take the
short end of the bet on your
future. I will not gamble with
them. They know too much.
They have actuarial experience
tables from which they can ac-
curately predict your collective
futures. They know how many
of you will become famous en-
gineers, millionaires, real estate
brokers, secretaries of com-
merce, aldermen, congressmen,
obscure citizens, how many will
have arterio-sclerosis at sixty
and how many will break 80 on
18 holes.
At the risk of appearing fa-
cetious, the suggestion is offered
in all sincerity. Do not lose the
opportunity of finding out what
each professor thinks about you. So far as your
future is concerned, he is the best clairvoyant you
will likely meet. Of course he will hedge his bet
because he knows what his error exposure is.
All this is tantamount to saying that college fac-
ulties are alive to their tasks and are doing their
jobs better with each collegiate generation against
no inconsiderable odds, including undergraduates
and self-appointed consulting alumni.
FREDERIC W. WILLARD
My generation has earned no right to preach to
your generation. We have more total losses than you
will have. We blundered along, regaling you with
plenty of bally-hoo about the
marvelous age of which WE are
the testators. We admit we are
good. On ceremonial occasions
we magnanimously pass a little
credit to our predecessors, and
when we are compelled to ex-
plain the unpleasant affair of
1914-1918, we pass it all to
them.
You have a right to ask just
how good is that fur-coated, dia-
betic congregation between the
ten yard lines. Let us try to
make an honest inventory:
We have put four pneumatic
shod wheels under every six citi-
zens of the land. It g a v e us
more freedom to get acquainted,
to become broader minded, to
produce more useful things each
day and spread these things
among a great many people.
But, in increasing our mobility
we have made it much easier for the unscrupulous
to frisk the scrupulous and get away with it. We
leave that for you to solve.
Not satisfied with sixty miles per hour, we rose
up from the earth and flew 125 miles per hour.
That helps to make us closer neighbors. But it
also expands political neighborhood squabbles, the
delicate lavender of the United States in our old
geographies flows into the cold blue of the Do-

minion of Canada. Horrible! What shall we do
about it? Oh! we will leave that to you.
We could not possibly stop with high speed
transportation, we just had to talk with each other
instantly. So we did it. For a while we were con-
tent with private confidential conversation over a
pair of copper wires, but that did not satisfy us.
We could usually get the other fellow to listen to
us for three minutes, if we did not try to reverse
the charges, but we aspired to tell the world,
whether it wanted to hear us or not. And we did.
Well it made more people BUSY. Made more
golf players, more houses and more homes, silk
stockings for everybody, depriving the privileged
class of its cherished badge of distinction, and the
self-appointed prophet of the proletariat, of his
most potent epithet. More action and less thought,
longer lives and shorter sermons, more acquaint-
ances and fewer friends. We think we arc safely
in the black, but we expect you to assume the
liabilities.
Our predecessors left us a system of transporta-
tion on metal rails by which we greatly profited.
It opened up new lands for us, fetched tropical
fruits and vegetables to our tables, clinched our
parasitic grip on the patient cow and the indus-
trious domestic fowl. Of course that accomplish-
ment was only a trifle compared with OUR petrol
perambulator, but if you cross examine us, we will
have to admit that the fathers who laid the rails
are still feeding and clothing us, and shamefacedly
we confess that we have done little to improve
these rails and the service thereof. Of course the
fathers were rough, uncouth customers who handed
us the rails all plastered with mortgages and law
suits, and who are of course to be blamed because
we had to spend so much time with the judge and
the sheriff. So we pass to you the job of better
railroads. We think you will need them in ad-
dition to our magnificent gift of pussy-footed palan-
quins.
Our ancestors had a sample of a curiously light,
silvery looking metal in their museums. They ad-
mired it very much. We were much wiser, we used
it and now pass on to you a great art for its pro-
duction. It helped us to fly in the air. We hope it
will help you to stay on the ground and fix up the
afore-mentioned railroads. You have the job of
developing its alloys and the alloys of its near
relative magnesium, if you arc to get the most
out of it.
Our fathers handed us the science of steam en-
gineering along with the railroads, taught us how
to extend its jurisdiction by means of electrical
energy. On this form of energy a sizable manu-
facturing industry has been built. We have started
to apply it to transportation after making several
false moves. \Ve will not have time to finish it, so
we pass it on to you. Better have an early look
at our super-power plans. You can get it on thc»&lt;e
plans early enough so you will not need to "pa.-.&gt;
the buck" to us thirty years hence when the mis-
takes begin to develop.
We find a lot of fault with the fathers for not
building a great chemical industry, for throwing
away the most valuable part of our coal to get
coke to make steel to build railroads. Of course
we do not shout it from the housetop but con-
fidentially we admit they did pretty well. If they
threw away millions of tons •&gt;{ benzol and naph-
thaline and carbolic acid, it was because they
needed steel more and could not sell the blamed
chemicals even if they saved them. While we are
boasting about the chemical industry we are leav-
ing to you, you can read in the book that the
fathers showed us how to get at our great deposits
of sulphur cheaply. Without that we would not
have made such a splash.
While we are cursing the fathers for wasting so
much good stuff in making coke, we are now just
waking up to the fact that our much advertised
by-product ovens are not so economical. We pas&gt;
to you the job of low temperature coking.
You had better have a good look at this chem-
ical industry. You may need it.
We have to admit that we made a fizzle of the
business of keeping the peace. After getting our-
selves mired in the biggest scrap ever put on. we
dragged you in to help finish it. You know that
we were not prepared for it, that we did not know-
how to use the new chemical weapons and that we
and you will continue to pay for this ignorance.
We know that some of you are sure that you can
prevent future wars once you get your hands on
the tiller. May be so. It is not good form to dis-
courage any worthy ideal. We persuaded you to
go out and fight by assuring you that this last big
fight would settle the war business forever. Now
we have to confess that we are not so sure about
it. Anyhow, the next one will be a chemical war,
so it will be the better part of valor to give at-
tention to the chemical industry.
One of our favorite indoor sports has been to
upbraid the fathers for their lack of intelligence in
the treatment of labor in their great industrial ex-
pansion. We have had our troubles and we pass
back all the blame. If any merit accrues to us it
is considerably obscured by the necessities of our
problem. Wre had to do something. Some of the
things we have done seem to be good, others are
not so good.
We had to start mechanizing the heavy physical
tasks and \vc have been roundly cursed for doing
it. but we think you will some day agree that it
is good. At any rate, you will have to finish it.
Some day society will demand that muscle shall
not do what a machine can do.

MOTOR CAR AND MOTOR FUEL POTENTIAL
By GUSTAV EGLOFF, Ph.D.*
EVERY man, woman, and child in the United
States could ride in the 20,OCX),000 motor
cars in operation in this country. There is
one car for every six persons in the United States
and for the rest of the world there are approxi-
mately five million motor cars in operation, or one
car for every three hundred and sixty persons. The
startling prosperity in the United States makes it
possible for the oil industry to produce motor fuel to
the extent of twelve billion
gallons during the year
192o. Of this quantity ap-
proximately four billion
gallons of motor fuel will
he derived from the crack-
ing process; one billion
from natural gas and one
h u n d r e d million from
coal, and the balance from
the normal distillation of
crude oil. The health,
wealth, and happiness of
the people of the United
States is now largely de-
pendent upon the auto-
mobile and oil industry,
which makes it possible
for them to ride collec-
tively seven hundred and
twenty billion passenger
miles during the year
1926. This means that

tains and cities arc tra-

motor fuel potential for Europe, using eighty mil-
lion motor cars.
One may well pause and ask where will the
motor fuel come from to supply the world po-
tential demand.
At the present time the world production of
the United States during the year 1926 there would
be required approximately one hundred and fifty
billion gallons per year, or forty billion gallons of
crude oil is approximately
a billion barrels, from
which is derived approxi-
mately fourteen billion
gallons of motor fuel by
n o r m a 1 distillation and
the cracking process. This
amount of in o t o r fuel
could be more than dou-
bled by the cracking proc-
ess using the same quan-
tity of crude oil. The
crude oil sources of the
world are enormous and
can supply the world mo-
tor fuel demand for years.
As a matter of fact at the
present time the United
States has a surplus of oil
and is producing much
more than its require-
ments. There cannot be
a shortage of motor fuel
for centuries to come
when one takes into con-
sideration the supply of

individual.
Much is stated about the saturation point of
automobiles and where is the oil coming from to
supply the ever increasing demand for motor fuel.
May one look into the future a bit and expect that
there will be one motor car for each six persons
in the world, which would mean a requirement of
over three hundred million motor cars. Or con-
lining our calculations of motor car potential to
Europe where it is estimated that four hundred
and eighty million persons live, the European re-
quirement of one car to each six persons would
mean eighty million motor cars.
To supply the future world potential of motor
fuel demand of three hundred million motor cars
based upon the average quantity used per car in
The true potential quantity of crude oil under
the earth's surface is an unknown quantity. Much
speculation is rife as to how much oil there may
be available potentially. Predictions have been
made, time on end, .since the foundation of the oil
industry in the United States during the year
1859. All of the predictions have been found to
be widely off the mark. It is reasonably certain,
based upon past experience, that the oil industry
will supply the automotive engine needs for years
to come. Never has there been a real shortage of
oil in the history of the industry. Hundreds of
millions of barrels of crude oil, fuel oil and re-
fined products are in storage at the present time.

Much energy is being expended to slow down on
further drilling of oil wells in such huge fields as
the Panhandle Texas, and the Seminole in Okla-
homa.
South America apparently is one vast sea of oil.
Russia, Persia, Roumania, have large oil produc-
tion with vast potential oil in reserve. Oil findings
in Canada, Africa, China and other countries are
indicated which may develop in a large way when
the economic demands justify it.
BATTERY OF TWO-STAGE, HIGH PRESSURE
CENTRIFUGAL PUMPS.
It is interesting to point out the vast tar sand
deposits of Alberta, Canada, which could supply
the present world motor fuel demand for over a
hundred years by using the cracking process.
When one comes to coal as a potential source
of motor fuel, the known deposits of bituminous
coal estimate of astronomical figures is reasonably
accurate. The world supply of bituminous coal is
estimated to be three trillion, one hundred and
fifty-four billion tons. This amount of bituminous
coal can by. means of low temperature carboniza-
tion and the cracking process be converted into
approximately four hundred and seventy-three bil-
lion, one hundred million barrels of motor fuel.
This volume of motor fuel could supply the world's
needs for over thirteen hundred years at present
rate of consumption. Or on the basis of a motor
car for each six persons in the world today, motor
fuel from all the bituminous coal would last over
one hundred years. The bituminous coal deposits
in the United States represents a little over one-
half of the total of the world.
The oil shale deposits of the United States, ac-
cording to the best estimate, amounts to three
hundred ninety-four billion, three hundred forty
million tons, from which over fifty-four billion bar-
rels of motor fuel can be produced by the crack-
ing process. Just how much oil shale is available
in the world is not clear. However, it would be
reasonably safe to say at least again as much avail-
able as there is in the United States, hence the
world supply of oil shale could produce over one
hundred and eight billion barrels of motor fuel.
This amount of motor fuel would operate the
motor cars of the world at the present rate of
consumption for over two hundred fifty years.
The potential amount of wood tars derivable
from trees, plant life, etc., is an unknown quantity.
It is difficult to state how much could be obtained.
However, that it would be relatively large is cer-
tain. The wood tars can be converted into motor
fuels suitable for automotive use by the cracking
process.
One need feel no alarm about our future motor
fuel supply in view of the tremendous sources
available from petroleum, coal, oil shale and wood
tars. Our potential future motor fuel supplies will
last for centuries and will be derived from the
cracking of petroleum, coal tar, oil shale and wood
tar.
The future motor fuel in all likelihood will be a
blend of normal motor fuel and cracked motor fuel
derived from petroleum, coal tar, shale oil, wood
tar or a combination in varying percentages. The
motor fuel will yield double the mileage per gal-
lon over that now being obtained in the motor car
of today. The specifications will be anti-knock
and ease of starting the engine and will have no
color, odor, doctor or sulphur test as a criterion
of its utility.
The urge of the present period is to produce
high anti-knock motor fuel in quantities sufficient
to operate high compression motors which must
come on the market so that more mileage per gal-
lon of motor fuel will be obtained.
The anti-knock properties of motor fuel are a
function of the type hydrocarbons present and to
the percentage composition. In all motor fuel&gt;
tfiere are four groups of hydrocarbons present con-
sisting of the aromatic, naphthene, unsaturated and
paraffin groups. The reaction velocity of the dif-
ferent groups of hydrocarbons with air and oxy-
gen varies quite widely. Depending upon the per-
centage of the four groups of hydrocarbons present
in a motor fuel it may be entirely non-detonating
or detonating to a high degree in a high compres-
sion motor. The higher the percentage of aromatic,
naphthene and unsaturated hydrocarbons present
in a motor fuel the better it will be from a non-
detonating viewpoint. The ease of starting a motor
fuel is a function of the type hydrocarbons present.
The cracking reaction may be so controlled that
the non-detonating hydrocarbons can be produced
in the percentages desired so that they will lend
themselves particularly to blending with straight-
run motor fuel with a view to improving its burn-
ing qualities.

Paraffin Hydrocarbons
The paraffin hydrocarbons are notorious deton-
ators when under combustion conditions in an
automotive cylinder. The paraffins have a ten-
dency to explode at a high velocity when under
pressure conditions of an automotive cylinder and
the exploding effect of high velocity of combustion
increases with increase of pressure. Paraffin hydro-
carbons are chemically called straight-chain com-
pounds composed of hydrogen and carbon. The
per cent of hydrogen in relation to the carbon con-
tent of the molecule is at its maximum compared
to any other type hydrocarbon. Although paraffin
hydrocarbons are notorious detonators, but re-
cently a new paraffin hydrocarbon has been made
in the laboratory by Dr. Graham Edgar, called
tri-methyl-isobutyl methane, which has anti-knock
properties equivalent to benzol, whereas the nor-
mal octane having the same number of carbon and
hydrogen atoms as the synthetic octane is a vio-
lent knock inducer. A paraffin hydrocarbon gaso-
line is a poor motor fuel as such and requires the
addition of dopes, benzol, or cracked gasoline to
make it useful in a high-compression motor.
Unsaturated Hydrocarbons
The unsaturated hydrocarbons are straight-chain
compounds similar to the paraffins but strikingly
different in reactivity toward chemical reagents,
particularly oxygen. The combustion of unsatu-
rated hydrocarbons in an automotive engine under
pressure takes place relatively slowly so that there
is no tendency toward knocking but relatively
quiet burning. The quiet burning of unsaturated
hydrocarbons is due to its chemical constitution.

CHAMBERS, DEPH LEGM ATORS. AND FLUE-GAS RE-
CIRCULATING SYSTEM OF DUBBS CRACKING PLANT.
There are two less hydrogen atoms in the molecule
when compared to a paraffin hydrocarbon having
the same number of carbon atoms. The mere dif-
ference of two hydrogen atoms in the molecule
(comparing the same number of carbon atoms in
the unsaturated and paraffin hydrocarbons) so pro-
foundly modifies the combustion velocity that
there is apparently an entirely different effect tak-
ing place in an automotive cylinder during com-
bustion of paraffin and unsaturated hydrocarbons.
As far as we know there are practically no un-
saturated hydrocarbons present in motor fuel de-
rived from the normal distillation of crude oil,

INSTRUMENTS.
however, when petroleum oils are distilled under
pressure there is produced a high percentage of
unsaturated hydrocarbons in the cracked motor
fuel. The percentage of unsaturated hydrocarbons
present in cracked gasoline is a function of the
temperature, pressure time and type of cracking
stock. The unsaturated hydrocarbons present in
cracked motor fuels have a utility of maior import
in the operation of high-compression motors due
to their non-detonating tendency under combustion
conditions of high pressure.
Naphthene Hydrocarbons
Naphthene hydrocarbons are present in straight-
run motor fuel particularly those derived from Cali-
fornia, Texas and Smackover crude oil fields. The
naphthenes have non-detonating properties which
increase the utility of the motor fuel for auto-
motive use under high compression. The naph-
thenes burn relatively slowly in an automotive en-
gine under pressure and are somewhat superior to
the unsaturated hydrocarbons in this respect. The
chemical constitution of the naphthene hydrocar-
bons is markedly different than either the straight-
chain paraffin or unsaturated. The naphthenes are
cyclic or ring structured hydrocarbons of a satu-
rated nature having the same percentage of hydro-
gen in the molecule as the unsaturated (ethylene
series) hydrocarbons. The naphthenes have the
maximum percentage of hydrogen possible under
its ring structure. Although their structure is en-
tirely different to the paraffin hydrocarbons they
act chemically somewhat alike under normal con-
ditions but under the compression pressure of an

automotive cylinder the naphthenes burn quietly
without violence.
The chemical structure of the naphthene hydro-
carbons undergoing combustion at high pressure
in a cylinder differentiates it from the paraffin and
unsaturated hydrocarbons and gives it superior
properties as a gasoline. Under cracking conditions
naphthene hydrocarbons are produced in material
percentages of utility to the cracked gasoline pro-
duced.
Aromatic Hydrocarbons
Another group of cyclic or ring-structured hydro-
carbons are those of the aromatic series. The aro-
matic hydrocarbons have six less hydrogen atoms
to the molecule for the same number of carbon
atoms present than those of the unsaturated and
naphthene groups. The aromatic hydrocarbons are
unsaturated cyclic compounds which have remark-
able non-detonating properties under the highest
practical compression pressure which may be used
in an automotive engine. The low boiling point
members of the aromatic series are benzol, toluol
and xylols which are non-detonating under the
highest pressure it would be practical to build an
automotive engine for service use. They are so
high in non-detonating properties that they may
be blended with straight-run motor fuel bringing
it to a non-detonating value suitable for high-com-
pression motor use.
The aromatic hydrocarbons burn very slowly
under pressure conditions prevailing in a high-
compression motor. The rate of oxidation or com-
bustion is due to the chemical constitution of the
aromatic hydrocarbons and is the reason why they
burn so slowly under high pressure conditions
comparative to the paraffins, unsaturated and naph-
thene hydrocarbons, for they all contain the two
elements, hydrogen and carbon, in different chem-
ical combinations and constitutions.
Aromatic hydrocarbons are present in straight-
run motor fuel derived from California, Texas,
Smackover, Java, Borneo and other oil fields. The
aromatic hydrocarbons are produced in the crack-
ing of petroleum oils in relatively high percent-
ages. The higher the percentage of aromatic hydro-
carbons formed the greater the utility as a gasoline
in an automotive engine and can be blended with
straight-run motor fuel to bring up the mixture to
a motor fuel of service in a high-compression
motor.
The Dubbs cracking process for the conversion
of heavy oils into motor fuel is going on in many
of the refining centers of the world. The process
is so flexible that if there were one hundred dif-
ferent oils lined up in one hundred different tanks,
whether the oils were kerosene, gas oil, wax dis-
tillate, fuel oil, coal tar or its distillates, shale oil
or its distillates, or wood tar, by merely manipulat-
ing a few valves they can be cracked in the same
instrumentality into high yields of commercial anti-
knock motor fuel.
The cracking of oil is a chemical phenomenon
taking place commercially under heat and pressure.
The hydrocarbon oil undergoing change is disso-
ciated into gasoline and coke under operating tem-
perature and pressure conditions prevailing. The
production of gasoline and coke takes place bv
pumping hydrocarbon oil through a continuous
pipe coil and said oil is heated therein to a tem-
perature of approximately 800 to 900° F. under
pressure of 200 pounds more or less varying in ac-
cordance with the type and gravity of the oil
treated. The heated oil from the continuous pipe
coil passes into a reaction chamber which is in-
sulated. The heated oil vaporizes therein, passing
to the bottom of a fractionating column, coming
into contact with the raw charging stock which is
pumped from the storage tank into the fractionator.
The gasoline portion of the vapors passes from the
top of the fractionator to a water condenser under
the pressure of the system and is continuously dis-
charged from the receiver to storage. The heavier
portions of the vapor in the fractionating device
are liquefied by the incoming charging stock and
combine with the unvaporized portion of the raw
charging stock and pass to the suction side of a
hot-oil pump, to be pumped through the heating
coil and subjected therein to cracking conditions
under controlled temperatures and pressures. The
coke formed during the chemical reaction accumu-
lates in the reaction chamber. As a function of the
temperature conditions prevailing in the cracking
system under the operating pressure, motor fuel
of high anti-knock qualities is produced. In this
type of operation simultaneous topping, cracking,
and coking take place all in one operation.
Treating of Motor Fuel
One of the most difficult problems in the oil in-
dustry is the refining of cracked gasoline without
loss of valuable anti-knock components. The actual
refining operation is not difficult in meeting mar-
ket specifications, but the loss of actual motor fuel
may run as high as twenty per cent due to treat-
ment of same. The usual method of refining
cracked gasoline is by treating with the chemical
reagents sulphuric acid, caustic soda, sodium plum-
bite and water. These reagents are added in varv-
ing amounts and the order of their addition to the
gasoline undergoing treatment also varies.
The amount of sulphuric acid which is used mav
range from approximately two pounds to over
twenty pounds to the barrel of oil undergoing
treatment.
And what is the function of the chemical treat-
ment of gasoline? It is for the purpose of produc-

WHAT INDUSTRY MEANS To ME
By S. WELLS UTLEY
IN the first chapter of his book on, "The Psy-
chology of Business," Dr. Hugo Munsterberg
makes a challenging statement, which I shall
attempt to paraphrase and condense. He says that
during the last few decades the progress in com-
mercial endeavor and the field of science have been
so great that we are easily inclined to think, that
similar progress has been made in all other lines
of human endeavor, and that there can be no
greater illusion than this. No
buildings, said he, have been
built in the twentieth cen-
tury so beautiful as those of
the old Creeks, nor probably of
so enduring a character; no
dramas have been written so
wonderful as those of their
great poets; no philosophy has
been taught so significant as
that of their great thinkers.
The chiseled statues of their
sculptors are alike the admir-
ation and despair of those who
today would rival them. Our
legal life and jurisprudence is
not superior to that of the old
Romans, and our state and city
politics, together with our poli-
ticians, are not essentially dif-
ferent from those of ancient times. We are stirred
by the same motives, buoyed up by the same hopes,
depressed by the same fears, spurred on by the same
love of family and friends, torn by the same hatred
and jealousies. Man is the same before his God,
he is the same in his family. He is responding to
the same forces and emotions today as have his
ancestors for countless generations before him.
But in our industrial life, with its manufacture,
its transportation, its distribution, and in our de-
velopment of scientific thought, on the one hand
born, encouraged and developed by the wealth and
leisure rising from industrial organizations, and on
the other, itself lifting that industrial development
to undreamed of heights, in these two things alone
the change is fundamental and revolutionary. No-
where else can we so directly measure the prog-
ress of the human race as in these glorious changes
in commerce and industry. Nowhere else can we
find so potent a factor in the change from tiie
hardship of the life of the ordinary citizen of an-
cient days to the comparative ease of the present,
f"T"MiE accusation that engi-
JL neering and scholarly pur-
suits are incompatible finds a
strong denial in the mind of Mr,
Utley, To most of us, the pas-
time of visualizing Industry as
something other than a great
vague indefiniteness wherein we
have a niche called a job, is rare.
Classification of thoughts and
ideas upon a subject often paves
the way to success; logical
thought and vision based on such
a fund of knowledge and associ-
ation is many times the forerun-
ner of genius.—The Editor.
as in these various activities which we class as
modern industry,
I am sorry we haven't time to trace the history
of any one of the ordinary things of our life, such,
for instance, as the cup of coffee we have, which
we have at breakfast. If we could, I think we
should realize that everything we have today, our
food, our clothes, our homes, our education, are
the result primarily not of our own efforts, but of the common efforts of our en-
tire generation, together with
the cumulative efforts of all
those who have labored before
us in the building up of what
we call civilization.
We should realize that the
main-spring of this develop-
ment has been the perfectlv
natural and laudable desire of
man, spurred on by the love of
his family, to improve his own
conditions, and that in improv-
ing his own conditions, he has
made life easier for the rest of
us. We should realize that
society has so organized her-
self that when any man strives
in a legitimate manner to pro-
mote his own interests by cre-
ating more than he consumes, the major part of
the benefit comes not to himself, but to society
as a whole. It is as though she said to him,
"Think, work, produce, and if you succeed I will
allow you a part of what you achieve, to have and
to hold for yourself and yours, only so long as you
continue to employ it for my benefit." Under this
inexorable law a man may labor with his hands and
produce only so much as his mouth consumes, or
on the other hand he may bring forth a single new
idea for which the world has waited For countless
centuries and for which his reward seems almost
beyond comprehension. The wealth, tremendous
as it was, which society gave to Mr. Rockefeller,
was infinitesimal compared to the benefit she re-
ceived when his genius so organized the distribution
of kerosene oil that during the latter part of the
last century, in the cities, on the farms, in the far
distant corners of the earth, the kerosene lamp
vanished the hours of darkness with which the
world had been imprisoned and gave the ambitious
boy the time and opportunity to improve himself.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The fact that during that period it was almost uni-
versally possible for a man to read and study at
night, is very largely responsible for the tremen-
dous progress which we have made during the last
few years.
When we examine the functions of industry, I
take it that we shall find that a man first conducts
a research and gets an idea, cither as to an ele-
ment or a law of nature and then taking these ele-
ments and the laws of nature, he either puts work
upon them or re-groups them in some manner
which makes the element of more use to the human
race. Some of our friends, with their great research
laboratories and fine equipment, may think that
their profession is a new one, but I suspect it has
always existed and always been an essential part
of industry. I take it that when James Watt
watched the lid of the tea kettle rising as the
steam came up he was a research engineer, that
when he turned around with that information and
built an engine he was an industrialist. We have
always been doing research work, most of it being
exceedingly crude and very elementary from the
viewpoint of modern standards, but nevertheless it
has been the germ of our present fine development.
We are commencing to realize that the ancient
thinkers glimpsed the fundamental laws of nature
much better than we have thought and that it is
the industrial development of the microscope and
other scientific instruments and the constant race
between industry in building a new machine and
research in developing a new thought impossible
of application without the use of that machine that
largely accounts for the difference in the develop-
ment of the range of scientific thought in ancient
and modern times. Industry can't get along with-
out research, but on the other hand, research can't
get along without industry, because a new idea is
of no value to humanity until the industrialist has
put it in such form that it ministers to human
needs.
But industry has another function less readily
understood. It acts as a machine or a lever, if you
will, by which the work of the individual is mul-
tiplied and made more useful to society, which
means that the individual is able to get in a wage
very much higher from society than he would get,
if it were not for industry. On the railroads down
here there are a lot of Mexican laborers, probably
getting $4.00 or $5.00 a day, for doing work on
the tracks. Down in Mexico these men do exactly
the same thing, on the same kind of tracks, prob-
ably at a wage of from 25 cents to 50 cents a day.
There is no difference in the men, no difference in
the work they do, but the fact that it is done up
here in an industrial society, where the industrial
machine makes it of more value to the human race,
enables these men to get a wage that is many
times larger than commanded by the same work
in a non-industrial organization.
Tremendous as it is, however, the success of all
this industrial activity depends absolutely upon the
functioning of the human mind. Just as the great
mill may be in perfect condition, its rolls in place,
its motors geared to their drives, and every de-
tail ready for operation, and yet no product comes
forth unless the mysterious thing we call electricity
is flowing through its wires and bringing motion
to its silent machines, just so our industrial ma-
chines will not function unless there be at their
head a human brain with both the ability and the
energy to drive the organization. Some years ago
I heard Mr. Babson make the statement that if you
were to suddenly take two per cent of its popu-
lation from Detroit, this two per cent embracing
those men who occupy the so-called top positions
of our modern life, our best doctors, our best law-
yers, our managers, our superintendents, and our
foremen, the remaining ninety-eight per cent would
not be able to keep from starving to death. How
often have we seen the value of a single brain,
demonstrated by watching a great corporation sink-
ing slowly and steadily to the verge of bankruptcy,
and then to have its directing head replaced by
another man and see it reverse its course and come
back into a useful and a prosperous life.
Industry, I think, during the last few years has
been learning many useful lessons. It has come to
realize that both the man who works in the dirt
of the mill and Judge Gary who directs the Steel
Corporation, are servants of society, and that both
are able to function efficiently only so long as they
follow the rules and laws, economic and social,
which society has laid down. It has come to real-
ize that, "the product pays the wages," not the
corporation which ostensibly is filling the pay en-
velope, and that this being true, the more product
there is produced for society the more in the long
run will there be for distribution in wages. It has
come to realize distinctly that money is but a
measure of value, the same as a yardstick or a
calorie, that the real wealth is not in money but
in the things produced, in cylinder blocks and
manifolds, in automobiles, and other things which
humanity demands. It has come to realize that
its function is to bring forth the greatest possible
number of the things which humanity wants, with
the fewest possible drops of human sweat.
Our friends who see industry without under-
standing it are prone to say that it thinks only of
profits, and that it thinks only of material things.
It seems to me that one of the gravest charges
which can be brought against industry today is the
fact that it thinks too little of profits. These are

A VACATION IN FRANCE
By JAMES R. KELLEY AND PERCY 0. DANFORTH
FOR ;( couple of students of architecture about
the most promising outlook for a pleasant
summer's vacation is to arrive in Paris and
be in the midst of buying up supplies for a sketch-
ing trip; a trip that can _
last until the nights be-
gin getting cooler and the
days shorter and classi-
fication day begins to
worry you again. The
supplies might include a
Ford of about the same
quality as the usual cam-
pus type, some old clothes
to go with it and of
course the sketch books
and other equipment, that
;ire just what you think
you can use to the best
advantage. O n e of the
chief sources of pleasure
in buying these things is
in the fact that they are
so cheap in dollars and
still so good in quality.
The franc is at such a
value, and probably will
remain there for some
time, that the dollar has a
buying p o w e r n e a r 1 y
three times as great as in
this countrv.
Paris, to an architect,
presents a maze of things
of the greatest interest.
Years could be spent to advantage studying its ar-
chitectural wonders. In two short weeks one can
barely get an idea of what it all means much less
seriously study or absorb the character and feeling
oi the places and its wonders. It resolves itself into
a case of just going here and there and taking in
the high lights, tourist fashion, in order that you
may get even a good impression of things. These
"things you should not miss" are all very interest-
ing but more humanly and quaintly interesting are
the old back streets and courtyards of old Paris
that you can only find by nosing around here and
there into the less frequented places. The odd cor-
ners and patched and much altered old buildings
with their maze of oddly shaped and colored chim-
ney pots are good impressions of the life that has
been carried on within these walls for centuries.
But after dodging the taxis all day and listening
to the perpetual toot of their horns through the
night in Paris it is a pleasing contrast to put up in
a small country town for a few days. A place
where you can walk
down the middle of the
street in safety and where
the true French idea of
leisure and ease of living
can take hold of you and
help you enjoy a real va-
cation. Such a place is
Vernon, about fifty miles
down the Seine from
Paris. There is plenty of
excellent material for
sketching with its wealth
of old homes both in half
timber and stone. If one
is sufficiently ambitious
there is also a wonderful
old cathedral upon which
to try one's skill. The
whole country all down
along the Seine to Rouen
is of greatest interest and
furnishes m any a new
thrill in the quaintncss of
the small villages and the
regular landscaped effect
of its countryside. Ruins
of old Chateaux, such as
Chateau Gaillard at Les

the valley of the Seine can be had and where some-
thing of the spirit of medieval days is recalled, arc
worth while stopping places. With no definite
places to go or to be and with no aims excepting
to do as you please and enjoy yourself for a couple
of months, many of the little villages off from the
usual traveled roads may be visited. From these
places very pleasant memories are always carried
away of the peace and quiet and satisfaction of life
that only the more undisturbed places still retain.
When tourists become numerous and the life that
these people have led for generations in their little
villages is disturbed, unrest comes in to drive out
the very atmosphere that is the charm of the place.
Hence the tourist with the increased use of the
automobile is gradually removing by his presence

because of its apparent lack of any effective sys-
tem of sanitation, is at the same time a city of
beauty and great historical associations. Its nar-

row streets, many of which will scarcely allow two
cars to pass, its numerous old half-timbered build-
ings and its wonderful cathedrals more than coun-
terbalance the fact that there is often a slight flow
of sewage in the gutter in the foreground of the
picture. Nearing the time of July 14th, Bastille
day, nightly celebrations become in order and
street carnivals begin to set up their booths, merry-
go-rounds and concessions. The crowds of poor
people who gather together in these squares to
dance on cobbled streets to discordant music from
the merry-go-round are a sight and an experience.
Lisieux, a very old town right in the heart of
Normandy, boasts two cathedrals and a location
on the main route both by road ;tnd rail from
Cherbourg to Paris. It is really a rather progress-
ive French town; principally, I suppose, because
of the path of activity which passes through it.
Prices still remain at a reasonable level, however,
and a good room with running water, electric
lights, and a wonderful French bed can be had
for a price that is almost nothing compared to
American standards. I have seen thirty cent "flops''
advertised but these are quite exclusive and luxu-
rious by comparison. Meals are veiy reasonable
and always palatable and of good quality and quan-
tity. Not far from here, however, are Deauvillc
and Trouville, resorts along the coast where prices
are increased to meet the inflated purse and ideas
of the wealthy English and French vacationists
and these prices would of course be beyond the
endurance of a mere architectural student.
A town that is seldom touched by travelers is
Josselin, located in about the center of Brittany.
Here the contact with cities of any size is slight
and the people who make up the population of
some six or eight hundred are mostly of families
that have lived there for generations back ;'.nd do
not know or care a great deal about the things
that worry the crowded population of cities. They
live their own lives in their simple, quiet way
and are content without the conveniences such as
electricity, water pipe supply systems, household
conveniences, and paved streets or sidewalks that
we think are necessities. They continue to go to
bed as soon as it gets dark, carry water from the
fountain in the square, wash clothes down on their
knees along the streams, cut their wheat by hand,
and ride to town in the two-wheeled lorries behind
a horse or donkey in place of an eighty mile per
hour plant. They are more content and lead a more
natural sort of life however, in spite of all our
supposed advantages and hurry for they have never
lived any other way and know nothing different.
Their ancestors lived well that wav, and they cer-
tainly are proud of their pure Breton ancestry, so
why should they not do the same? Josselin spreads
out for almost a half mile along the hills and banks
of the River Oust, which is part of the Brest-
Nantes canal system. The town nestles in close
to its two dominating buildings, the Cathedral and
the Chateau de Josselin, and the old half-timber
houses with their sway-backed slate roofs and
jaunty angles still seem to be subservient to the
two ruling elements in whose shadows they re-
main. The chateau is among the oldest and best
preserved in France and one of the few that is
still owned by the original family. The present
owners are the Duchess of Rohan and her young
son. who will carry on the name and traditions of
the place and continue to be the idol of the coun-
tryside surrounding Josselin.

towns where ease and satisfaction with life are
the rule, and days of resting, amusement, and eat-

WHAT Is DESIGN ENGINEERING?
By A. M. DUDLEY, '02
Engineering Supervisor of Development Westinghoiise Electric $ Mfg. Co.
MUCH has been s;(id and written about the
designer of electrical apparatus, his selec-
tion, qualifications, training, reaction to
his work, his compensation, his past, present and
future, and other phases of his problem, but the
homely details of the designer's everyday routine
work, I think, have not been very extensively dis-
cussed. It is this presentation which I shall try
to make and try to make it in
a way to create a better under-
standing of design engineering.
I am certain that this needs to
be done, because in interviewing
several hundred graduates and
seniors of engineering schools in
the past three or four years, by
far too large a percentage think
they wish to take up sales work
or application engineering, or
something other than design
work. This, I feel, can be for no
reason other than misunder-
standing, because I know of no
class of men who are more en-
grossed in their work or who
obtain more satisfaction from
that work than designing engi-
neers. One needs only to read
an autobiography of an out-
standing design engineer like
Benjamin G. Lamme to realize
that the design engineer derives
the greatest possible pleasure from his work.
The design engineer has a desk in an engineer-
ing office with his associates, and his work comes
to him either in the form of letters or other papers
through the shop mail, or else through verbal con-
ferences with men in other departments. There
are also numbers of telephone requests for techni-
cal information or requests for personal service in
inspecting or advising on design or construction of
his machines. The work which arrives by mail
consists of three general classes: first, straight cor-
respondence in the form of letters referring to ma-
chines, past, present and future. Those regarding
past machines may involve records and informa-
tion for renewal parts or instructions as to desired
changes. They may also refer to possible difficul-
ties in installation or operation, and ultimately
require travel outside the works, as noted later.
Those letters regarding present machines may be
A. V. DUDLEY
requests for more complete performance, data,
requests for changes in mechanical arrangements
or dimensions, or similar problems touching the
design or building of the machines under actual
construction. Those letters referring to future
machines cover application data, performance data,
or cost and delivery data on jobs under negotia-
tion. The collection of many of the data for reply
to this correspondence can be
delegated to the drawing room
or to clerical assistants, but it
must clear through the engineer
to insure proper check and co-
ordination of the work under his
direction. This brings out the
point that a man's value in-
creases as he successfully under-
takes the direction of other em-
ployees. The measure of this is
his own ability to work with a
minimum of supervision. One
good rule to quote to a young
man is that when he needs very
little supervision in his own
work, he is ready to undertake
the supervision of others.
The second class of mail work
covers form cards for making
estimates on machines or appa-
ratus which vary from the stan-
dard line quoted in the price
form. These involve first a de-
cision as to whether the desired modifications are
permissible, or whether they involve so much spe-
cial work and supervision as to make them unde-
sirable on account of their interference with regular
production, or for any other reason. If the modi-
fication asked for is permissible, there is involved
an estimate of the frame on which the machine
would be built, the number of new parts and the
time required to make drawings and prepare engi-
neering information for manufacture, a cost refer-
ence which will enable a cost man to figure the cost
of development and the factory cost of the machine,
and also a complete performance specification. In
some cases, this involves calculation, if the par-
ticular combination of characteristics had never
been calculated before.
The third class of mail work is the receipt of
actual orders for machines sold which vary in some
particular from machines previously built or con-

sidered as standard. This variation may be slight,
as a difference in the length or diameter of a shaft
extension, or it may involve practically an entire
new machine from the ground up. In the latter
case, probably a preliminary calculation had been
made on the estimate described above, and the de-
signer checks this or refines it at his judgment
before writing the specifications for building the
machine. When he is ready, he writes a design
specification covering all the mechanical parts of
the machine and an electrical specification covering
the windings. These specifications go to the draw-
ing office and serve for the general guidance of the
drafting force, who, under the design engineer's
supervision, produce all drawings and bills of ma-
terial necessary for ordering all material, machining
it, and assembling it into the finished structure.
The engineer at the same time writes a test speci-
fication telling the testing department what tests to
make and what are the calculated and guaranteed
performance figures. Having written these various
specifications, the engineer's connection with the
child of his brain then becomes one of supervision
and consultation and scheming, rather than the
actual performance of further routine work. When
the machine comes on test, he examines it for ap-
pearance, noise, performance, and other features,
checks to see if guarantees are met, and finally
releases it for shipment so far as any technical
questions are involved.
Besides his services to his own drafting depart-
ment and the manufacturing department, the de-
sign engineer stands ready to serve the application
engineering department by passing on the suit-
ability of certain machines to meet the require-
ments of new developments in industry; he is
ready to serve the sales department by helping
them to sell a new job, or to satisfy the user re-
garding a job already in service and concerning
which there may not be entire satisfaction; he
serves the service department by telling them how
he thinks an installation or a repair job might best
be handled.
All this looks like a large order, but he has
still another line of work. He may write articles
for the technical press, or prepare papers for
learned engineering bodies, or serve on standard-
ization committees for trades associations, and so
keep himself in touch with his competitor's prac-
tice and progress in the art. He may also deliver
lectures before the students in engineering schools
and try to give them the real facts about the work
he is doing and how he does it, and sometimes he
may individually interview seniors in these col-
leges and explain the training course conducted by
his company.
I find several common misconceptions regarding
the design engineer: One, that he spends his days
altogether over the drawingboard. and another,
that he is merely a "slide-rule pusher." Of the
first, I have shown that he does practically none
except as he feels that he alone can show the
thing he has conceived; of the second, he does
no more than he needs to keep him on his toes and
interested in the mathematical side of his profes-
sion. A third is that "too much brains" is required
to be a designer. A man avoiding a profession for
this reason indicates that he lacks confidence in his
own ability, or else that he considers the designer
a "greasy grind" involved entirely in surroundings
of theory and mathematics. A fourth, the lack of
knowledge of how large a proportion of eminent
engineers have come from the ranks of the design-
ers or have had thorough design training. A fifth,
that the designer is a "narrow" man. He cannot
be and meet the specifications of the job as I know-
it. A sixth, that one cannot apply a straight for-
mula to a design and be sure of coming out with
the right answer. This is a curious objection, be-
cause it is one of the fascinating things about
designing that the answer is elusive and must be
found by a series of approximations more enter-
taining than the best jig saw puzzle. A seventh,
that design is not taught in an interesting way in
the schools. Like all difficult subjects, this is
probably true in some cases. In this connection, I
have one suggestion to make to the men who art-
teaching design, and that is to spend more time on
the ground-work and fundamentals and less time
having the students actually calculate designs. The
manufacturing companies can very readily do the
work of teaching the final technique, because they
have a mass of practical data and are skilled in the
use of short cuts. An engineer should go out from
school with a feeling that he understands the fun-
damentals of the magnetic and electric circuits, but
not necessarily with the feeling that he can figure
the best proportions for an operating machine.
That technique he can acquire very quickly after
graduation, if his ground-work is right.
Design work satisfies the primal instincts of
human nature. There might be some difference of
opinion as to what are primal instincts, but agree-
ment could be had on several of them; for ex-
ample: the creative instinct, the analytic, the in-
stinct desiring recognition of attainment, the in-
stinct desiring to render service, and the instinct
of self-preservation. All these are well served bv
design work. Taking them in order, consider the
creative. The designer certainly has a feeling that
he has created a functioning organism that never
existed before, and his pleasure in these brain
children is second only to his feeling for his human
offspring. With regard to the analytic: Human
beings have no greater satisfaction than that grant-
ed by investigating unknown and interesting phe-

INDUSTRIES OF MICHIGAN—II
FURNITURE-MAKING
By DOIXAL HAMILTON HAINKS
II'" this brief survey of Michigan's furniture man-
ufacture sounds a good deal like publicity
material issued by some civic organization
of Grand Rapids, the resemblance must be laid
to the actual position of that city in the world
of furniture rather
than to either bias
or carelessness on
the part of the
writer, for it is out
of the question to
write of the furni-
ture industry with-
out considering
Grand Rapids as the
focal point as it is
to omit all mention
of Paris from a
sketch of styles in
women's apparel.
And just as it is
impossible to write
of this industry
without tying the
story to a definite
locality, so is it dif-
ficult to express it in
terms of quantities produced, of technical develop-
ments, of growth in volume of business, because the
history has to so great an extent been made by
personalities. Furniture-making is still a handicraft
in spite of the millions of dollars worth of ingenious
and expensive machinery which has been brought
to the assistance of the workman's hands. It is
—leaving aside for the moment the questions of
quantity production and merchandising—wholly
a matter of inspired design plus manual dexterity.
If a man possesses a brain capable of conceiving
a distinctive chair or bed or chest of drawers, and
can make it with his own hands or furnish draw-
ings from which other artisans can make it, he
possesses just as adequate an equipment as the
greatest manufacturing concern in the country.
And because of this intensely personal element, the
development of the industry has been expressed in
the terms of the men who have given their lives
to its improvement rather than by specific dates
on which this or that new machine was added to
the necessary equipment of a successful factory or
a new method of finishing brought to perfection.
Because the beginnings of the industry go back
to a day well before the outbreak of the Civil
War, it is a common belief that these beginnings
were a natural development, due to the abundance
of natural resources—timber and water-power—
which made the southern part of Michigan the
natural field for the
development of the
business. T his is
only true in part;
Michigan had timber
and water-power,
but so did many
other parts of the
country in which
the industry died out
after flourishing for
a few years and, dur-
ing the period when
the manufacture of
furniture — particu-
1 a r1y in Grand
Rapids and the
vicinity — grew to
something like its
present proportions,
Michigan's timber
had been exhausted
•to such an extent that it no longer supplied any
considerable amount of the raw material, while
water-power had been almost wholly supplanted by
steam.
Somewhere between seventy-five and a hundred
years ago, every American community of sufficient
size to be partially self-supporting had its cabinet-
maker, lie made by hand the few pieces of house-
hold furniture which were required in the town,
usually selling them in the shop where they were
made, and, in the majority of cases, acting as both
manufacturer and salesman. The making of furni-
ture began this way in Grand Rapids precisely as
it did in hundreds of other communities, but,
thanks to the fact its first cabinet-maker, "Dea-
con" William Haldans, and some of his immediate
contemporaries were craftsmen strongly imbued
with the pride of their calling, it did not merely
remain in a state of comfortable but unprogressive
prosperity, meeting the immediate needs of the
community and being content with that; it began
to grow in response to the ideals and ambitions of
the men whose common interest bound them into
something very like a mediaeval "guild."

Long before the panic of 1857, which laid low
so many infant American industries, had been suc-
ceeded by the more prosperous period during and
following the Civil War, these hardy pioneers of
THE PRIDE OF THE CRAFTSMEN—A VETERAN OF THE
SCHOOL OF EXPERIENCE.
what has become one of the greatest industries of
the State had already reached a point where they
were not satisfied with the crude productions
which met the requirement of mere necessity—-
chairs that would hold up under the weight of the
rotund guest, tables which would not wobble, beds
in which a man could sleep with a feeling of se-
curity—but were doing their work under the
stimulus of aesthetic ambition as well as a mere
desire for increased business. And it is interesting
to note that this creative standard has endured
in spite of the growth of the industry and the great
extent to which machinery has replaced hand-
work. While quantity production has inevitably
come in, it has increased rather than reduced the
insistence upon quality among manufacturers.
For the furniture industry of Michigan, as well
as for a thousand other business ventures in dif-
ferent parts of the country, the 70's were lean and
troubled years, a period which saw few or no ad-
ditions in the way of new concerns, and through-
out which those already in existence had all that
they could do to maintain themselves. Here, even
more, perhaps, than during the earlier period of
its history, the undeveloped and only partly grown
business was saved by the sheer courage and
persistence of the men who had risked their small
fortunes in it.
A betting man at this time would have been
justified in laying generous odds against the
chances of Michigan ever taking a leading rank in
furniture production. The Grand Rapids pioneers
—and what was true of them was true even in
greater degree of the small early efforts in other
parts of the State—labored under a number of
handicaps whose total appeared too great to be
overcome. At that time the two greatest pro-
ducing centers for furniture were Boston in the
east and Cincinnati in the west, and both of these
larger cities possessed the advantage of earlier
entry into the field, far more abundant capital, bet-
ter factories and equipment and far superior ship-
ping facilities. Yet it was these greater centers
rather than their smaller rival which ultimately
yield place in the field, and the only possible ex-
planation is to be found in the indefatigable efforts
and stout-hearted refusal to be discouraged on the
part of the old school of furniture men.
To quote from a paper read several years ago by
the late William Widdicomb of Grand Rapids,—
one of the best known figures in the furniture
world:
"It is one of my theories that it is not so much
location or natural advantages that secure excep-
tional business success, but rather the personality
of the men who happen to originate and develop it,
and to this very feature do I ascribe the importance
which Grand Rapids achieved in furniture manu-
facturing. Fortunately its pioneer manufacturers
of furniture were the happy possessors of those
characteristics required for success in their own
industry . . . energy, industry, originality and
business prudence . . . and they did not know
the meaning of the word 'discouragement.'"
But, admirable as it was, the mere courage of
the furniture makers during this critical period of

the industry in Michigan was not their most re-
markable, although it may have been their most
necessary, contribution to its future. They seem


Page 19
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
to have labored with a certainty of what the com-
ing years held which is not always to he found in
similar undertakings; they laid for their successors
a somewhat broader foundation than is usually
handed on by men who can hope to do little more
than set corner-stones in place. If they had not
built and built with a conscious thought of creat-
ing better homes and a higher degree of taste in
furnishing them on the part of the public even
while they were building to sell and make a pro-
fit, it is hard to believe that the business they
founded could have risen so soon to its present
level. For, measured by the standards which
must be employed in such computations, Michi-
gan's furniture industry is still young alongside
some others, and yet it has reached in little more
than three-quarters of a century a point of develop-
ment which might easily have required twice that
length of time to produce.
One has only to study the old city directories of
Grand Rapids and other cities of the State to fol-
low with accuracy the purely business side of the
industry's growth. The years following the
critical '70's show a steadv increase in the number
of manufacturing firms, an ever larger number
of names of men of established reputation and
financial ranking—and from these could be inferred
the welcome increase of capital, the improvement
in shipping facilities, the waging of legitimate
competition on even terms or better with those
older firms which at the outset had seemed too
well established to yield place.
There was nothing esoteric about furniture mak-
ing in the past, there is nothing today. The last
word in "period furniture" is no more than the
logical development of the idea which blazed in the
tiny mind of the hairy savage and inspired him to
seat himself on round stone supported by a
sharpened stake and later to fasten the stone to
the stake with rawhide thongs or the tough
creeper torn from a tree. The early cabinet maker
was not required to produce anything better than
a stout, crude chair or bed because life was with-
out relaxations for the bulk of the people, leisure
was confined to a limited number, and pride in
household interior and furnishings was an emotion
as yet unborn in the average breast.
When one attempts to trace the growth of the
business on the artistic side, he encounters at once
one of those interesting but insoluble questions
like that of whether the first chicken or the first
egg took precedence. The writer has been un-
able to secure any definite evidence on this point;
it is not clear whether the first advance from the
rough-hewn furniture of the early days toward
the graceful and elegant creations of the present
had its impetus from the craftsman or his patrons.
It is recorded that some of the earliest creators of
furniture in Michigan supplemented the work of
plane and chisel by the installation of foot-power
lathes at a very early date, but whether it was an
act inspired by the desire to make better furniture
or committed in response to the demands of some
housewife whose inner aspirations could no longer
be satisfied by a table with square-hewn legs is
not known.
But the fact that the process is not esoteric and
that it has made free use of the machinery devised
for the rapid cutting, planing and smoothing of
wood, does not mean that it has ceased to be a

calling requiring skilled labor. In this respect it
remains a happy combination of the old and the
new; it has kept strictly up-to-date in every mech-
anical sense, yet done so without robbing the ven-
erable cabinet-maker (somehow one never imagines
young cabinet-makers!) of his work.
To go through a modern furniture factory would
prove an enlightening and helpful experience for
the man who sighs for the "good old days," and
who is all too apt to show you a chair brought to
America by his twice-great grandfather in the
eighteenth century, accompanying the exhibition
by the remark, "Look at that! They can't make a
chair like that now-a-days!" He would certainly
come out a wiser man and one more kindly inclined
toward the too-rapid present. For he would have
discovered that the modern factory cannot only
make a chair which looks exactly like the one in-
herited from his departed ancestor (and just as old
into the bargain if he cares for that sort of a fin-
ish !) but one which is in every respect a better
chair and the responsibility lies not in some soul-
less piece of machinery which turns them out by
the thousand, but in the active brain of a clever
designer and the patient hands of a middle-aged
or elderly workman who works with his mind
above thoughts of pay-envelopes.

A RECORDING ACCELEROMETER FOR
ROTATING MACHINERY
By H. W. BOUSMAN, '24E
THE Department of Electrical Engineering has
been interested for some time in the per-
formance of induction motors which of
course involves the speed torque relations. Due to
the considerable time and trouble necessary to get
a good point by point speed torque curve at the
operating temperature of an induction motor, we
developed a device to plot a continuous speed ac-
celeration curve. We might have obtained a good
space time curve that could be differentiated me-
chanically, once for speed and again for accelera-
tion,i but a direct acceleration time curve together
with a speed time curve, which would of course
give a speed acceleration curve bv taking off suc-
cessive ordinates, is preferable. After considering
several such devices that have been suggested2
the meter due to Professor Karapetoff, i.e., a con-
denser in series with a d'Arsonval element, was
used.
Let us assume a direct current generator with
constant excitation. Voltage, E = k o.; to is angu-
lar velocity. Then the current in the meter element
is, neglecting resistance and inductance of the

dt dt
pacity of the condenser. A small direct current
YVeston milli-ammeter with the pointer removed
and a standard oscillograph mirror pasted on
the meter clement forms the d'Arsonval part of
the instrument. This oscillograph mirror is a little
bit of silvered glass, a trifle less than a sixteenth
of an inch long and .017 inches wide. The whole
meter together with a box of condensers that may
be switched in and out of circuit we call an ac-
celerometer, and put it into the G. E. oscillograph
fiofor undtr
across the armature of the direct current generator,
deflection of this element being proportional to
the voltage, E, hence to the angular velocity. All
that is necessary now for our induction motor
speed torque curve is to connect this D. C. gen-
erator to the induction motor under test and assure
ourselves that we know the voltage applied to the
induction motor and other conditions of the test.
As a matter of routine testing we use one of our
electric dynamometers for the D. C. generator as
this permits a very simple calibration of the ac-
celeration time curve in terms of motor torque.
The motor torque at any speed is used up partly
in supplying the torque required to turn the dyna-
mometer armature at this speed and excitation, the
remaining torque going to accelerate the rotating
masses of dynamometer armature and motor rotor.
A photographic film is started moving at right
angles to the direction of deflection of the light
beams, at approximately constant speed, then
power is applied to the motor under test (which
is not necessarily at rest). From inspection of the
photographic record resulting we select a range
of speeds through which torque does not vary
greatly with speed. Such a range might be the
speeds near pull-out of the induction motor. (See
the sample curve of Fig. 2.) Afterward, using the
dynamometer as a dynamometer, not simply as a
direct current generator on open circuit, it is easy
to determine the total motor torque at a particular
speed in the selected range. This total minus the
torque required to turn the dynamometer at this
constant speed leaves the torque available for ac-
celerating the rotating parts on the previous test.
The accelerating torque divided by the ordinate of

case so that a beam of light may be reflected from
the mirror onto a moving film. (See Fig. 1.) The
deflection of the beam is (of course neglecting
errors which we shall discuss in the next para-
graph) proportional to acceleration. The move-
ment of the film gives a time axis. For a speed
time curve on the same film and same time scale
one of the oscillograph elements is used directly
the acceleration time curve at this speed gives a
scale in terms of torque directly, which is valid
throughout the curve. It is simply a matter of
detail to go over the oscillographic record and take
cff speed and accelerating torque poitns at cor-
responding times, add the torques necessary to
turn the dynamometer at the respective speeds and
plot the speed torque curve.

The other source of error is the effect of resist-
ance and inductance in series with the condenser.
The smallest rate of change of voltage that we
care to detect with certainty in our work is about
one-half volt per second, or one-tenth volt in the
fifth of a second required for the mechanical sys-
tem to respond. This is so large compared to the
voltage across the resistance (17 ohms X .0001
amp. = .0017 volt) that this error may be neg-
lected.
One suggested application that seems to be very
important is the experimental study of the be-
havior of synchronous machines near synchronism.
Inasmuch as the torque of synchronous machines
varies rapidly with relative position of rotor and
stator fields we shall have to look for a faster ac-
celerometer. It is out of the question to use a
standard oscillograph element (which is quite fast
enough) with a condenser in scries and an ordi-
nary direct current generator (which is of course
not a uniform direct current generator at all, but
has various frequencies of the general order of 500
cycles impressed upon the direct current voltage).
The form of accelerometer that we consider most
promising for this field is a transformer having an
air gap in the magnetic circuit sufficiently long
that the flux at reasonable densities is very nearly
proportional to primary current. We can put
enough resistance in series with the primary to

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
ENGINEERING FEATURES IN BREAKING THE
ALLEGHENY ICE GORGE
By HOWARD T. BARNES, D.Sc., F.R.S., M.E.I.C.
Prof, of Physics. McGill L'nirerxUy, Montreal, Quebec
EARL'S" in February, 1926, the surface ice on
the Allegheny river broke and moved down
over a distance of some 50 miles above Oil
City and Franklin, 1'a. The restriction of the river
at Rrandon, 14 miles below Franklin,! caused the
ice to stop and jam in such a way that the entire
mass above tilled the gorge to that city, causing
the river to rise, but not enough to cause apprehen-
sion. The character of the river is typical of these
mid-state streams, and
winds f o r miles be-
tween high cliffs with
shallows, islands and
deep hollows inter-
spersed. The normal
flow is in the neighbor-
hood of 3,CKX) second-
feet, but in the rainy
season or with a sud-
den storm the level
rises 20 feet or more
in a few hi&gt;urs.
Towards the end of
February a large quan-
tity of ice came down
from K i n z a u and
quickly jammed into
the pack which held below Franklin without dis-
lodging or moving it. This caused the river to
become packed from Franklin to Oil City, a dis-
tance of eight miles, with a rapid rise of water
level, higher than had ever been experienced by
these communities. So serious was the situation
with the flooding of Oil City and Franklin that
the entire water vyorks was put out of commission
and Oil City was left without water or lights for
several hours. The Pennsylvania Railroad put its
locomotives to work supplying steam for the
pumps, and the city fire apparatus was used to
assist in the same work. The two cities were in
very grave danger, apart from the uncomfortable
condition in which the lower streets were from
the high water and floating ice.
This second run of ice blocked the river up to
Oil City, and left a solid ice gorge for 20 miles. In
a few days more ice came down and blocked for
five miles above Oil City, making a solid and
almost dry ice jam 25 miles in extent.
Grave fear was evinced by the citizens over the
situation, as it would have been impossible to cope

VENANGO.
with a heavy rain, and the normal run-off from
such rain would have very materially increased the
Hood condition.
On the first of March a telegram was sent to
the writer from the Mayor of Oil City asking for
aid, and on the same day the writer left for New
York, where he got in telephone communication
with Oil City. In the meantime, the United States
army engineer at Pittsburgh had been in com-
munication with the
Mayor of Oil City and
had dissuaded him
from seeking aid from
the writer. From Xew
York, the writer ex-
plained over the tele-
phone that his methods
were unknown to most
engineers, and that he
felt certain the flood
level could be relieved,
as had been done else-
where. Later on in the
day a message was re-
ceived from the Oil
City Chamber of Com-
merce by the secretary,
Mr. L. H. (iavin, to come out to the Allegheny
valley to look over the situation. Accordingly,
the writer arrived in Oil City at noon on the
third of March and at once met the combined
Chambers of Commerce of Oil City and Franklin.
After describing the principles of the method of
ice control, which the writer had worked out dur-
ing many years of study and experiment on the
St. Lawrence, it was unanimously decided by the
Chambers of Commerce to finance the work, and
that same afternoon a special train was put on by
the Pennsylvania Railroad, whose tracks followed
the gorge for the entire length, and during the
afternoon the writer inspected every part of the
gorge. In the evening the writer again met the
members of the Chambers of Commerce, when the
method of attack was outlined and the various
committees of co-operation were organized. A spe-
cial Ice (Jorge Committee was formed, and at the
writer's request met every evening in the Chamber
of Commerce at Oil City and at Franklin on alter-
nate evenings. Reports of committees were re-
ceived each evening, and the work laid out for the
following day.

The writer realized that such a large jam could
not be moved easily with no water to float the
ice, and indeed, during the first week, the weather
was so cold that it was useless to send large
masses of ice down the river, as they merely
jammed lower down. The river was free of ice
lielow Brandon, and when the writer arrived the
Pennsylvania Railroad had been using dynamite in
an effort to break out the foot of the jam.

DER, 25 LBS., THERMIT, 160 LBS.
The remaining story of the work will be given
as the various steps are described. What has al-
ready been written brings the story up to the time
the writer took charge of all operations, and re-
ceived the loyal and hearty support of the citizens
of Oil City and Franklin.
METHODS OF ATTACK
As explained to the Chambers of Commerce,
every known method of attack known to the writer
would be used in forcing a passage for the water
through the gorge. In the writer's experience, ther-
mit had proved the most powerful tool, and while
other agencies were employed they were all of
small value compared to that.
The various committees formed were:
Thermit, under the personal direction of the
writer; dyjfamite, under the direction of Mr. }. T.
Ridgley, supervisor of the Pennsylvania Railroad,
Allegheny Division; calcium chloride, under Mr.
T. C. Frame; ash, sand and gravel, under Mr. I..
O. Bouquin; sulphuric acid, under Mr. F. B. Hall:
water levels, under Mr. XY. S. Wilson; weather
reports, under Mr. H. (',. Johnson; field inspec-
tion, by Boy Scouts, under Mr. I.. S. Culbertson
and Captain Ziegler.
Until March 5, the writer was engaged in gath-
ering material on the nature of the ice, plotting
the findings on the government maps of the river,
and planning the best method for the attack. Con-
tainers for the thermit were being constructed and
filled with the first ton ordered from New York.
Up to this time the dynamiting alone had been
carried out, and a small channel had been opened
through the lower end of the gorge with its use.
In a broad general way the use of the heat units
at first was for the purpose of opening up the
channels under the ice and weakening the surface
before taking the ice out in order to bring down
enough water to float the ice and afford relief to
the high water at Franklin and Oil City. As soon
as the weather moderated the various sections of
the gorge were treated, and large patches opened,
but when the warm weather set in the final re-
moval of the sections was effected with large
charges of thermit.
The use of dynamite was continued t-, free as
much of the restricted area below Brandon as
possible in preparation for the final removal of the
pack. As a matter of fact, the dynamiting had to
be discontinued shortly after the thermit was ap-
plied on account of the excessive bleeding of the
ice running ur.di.T the gorge and coming out at
the lower end.
The calcium chloride was used to open channels
in the surface ice near the bridges, and was found
quite effective.
The mixture of sand and gravel was used for the
same purpose, and was spread on the surface so
as to gather the sun's heat to melt the ice taster.
It was remarkable to sec the rapidity with which
the gravel sank into the ice. and at these treated
points patches of water opened when the weather
moderated.
Sulphuric acid was never used, although it was
kept in reserve, there being a considerable supply
of crude acid in the neighborhood.
Water levels were carefully observed at Frank-
lin and Oil City and at points higher up, and the
writer was kept constantly informed of these. At
the same time, weather reports were received dur-
ing the day from various stations along the river

as well as from the Weather Bureau at Wash-
ington.
The Boy Scouts were organized into groups for
observation at the various bridges near Oil City
and Franklin to report on the fluctuations of levels
and the surges from hour to hour. The entire

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
river during the first ten days was constantly surg-
ing and pulsating, due, no doubt, to the high head
of water seeking channels through the ice in the
lower pack. The boys also ran lines of stakes
across the river at two points near the railroad
bridges at Oil City and Franklin. These stakes
were capped with red, and were accurately placed
in alignment so that the slightest movement in
the upper pack could be at once detected. Long
before the ice was moved out the whole gorge
was slowly moving down stream like a glacier,
and the stakes gave the writer the first sign of
this movement.
DYNAMITE
OPERATIONS
The whole progress
of the dynamite oper-
ations i s recorded in
the minutes of the
daily repo'rts put in by
the head of the dyna-
mite committee. The
operations which had
been begun by the
Pennsylvania Railroad,
before the writer took
charge of the work,
had been discontinued,
pending the writer's in-
itial work of reorganization. They were resumed,
however, by the writer as soon as possible, as it was
doing effective work in "biting off" the foot of the
pack. On March 5 it was reported that in the lower
end of the gorge a channel 1,000 feet long and 80
feet wide had been successfully opened with the
use of 500 pounds of dynamite through ice in some
places 8 to 11 feet thick.
The report of the sixth stated that in the morn-
ing they made 15 holes 50 feet apart, and used
1,200 pounds of dynamite. In the first seven shots
they used 100 pounds each, and for the other shots
50 pounds. They took out 50-foot sections, 75 feet
wide, and approximately 1,700 feet of a channel
was made. The first ice encountered was 6% feet
thick, while at some spots it was as much as 11
feet. Subsequently, shots were put off at regular
intervals of ten minutes.
On March 8, it was reported that 500 feet more
of a channel had been opened up, but that most of
the time during the day had been spent in mak-
ing holes, so that the next day considerable prog-
ress could be made as most of the holes were
completed and more time could be devoted to
dynamiting.
On the following day it was reported that 14
shots had been used and from 1,600 to 1,700 feet
of ice taken out. The last shot made a 500-foot
channel 100 feet wide. It was put off just above
PENNSYLVANIA EXPRESS No. 900 TO PITTSBURGH,
SHOWN RACING THE MOVING ICE TO GET THROUGH
FIRST.
the first holes where the thermit had been used.
In this part the spacing of the shots was increased
and 100-foot sections were taken out, showing
weakening effect of the thermit action under the
ice. Ice taken out in this last section was 11 feet
thick.
It was reported that the ice sent down by the
operations of the previous day had jammed lower
down the river at the railway signal tower. Ef-
forts were made to dislodge this, using eight boxes
of dynamite. The attempt was unsuccessful, and
40 new holes were made for use the following day.
On March 11, most of the day was spent in
dislodging the lower
gorge and making 65
new holes, and the re-
port of the 13th was to
the effect that 100 feet
of the ice in the new
gorge had been shot
away, but that a block
of ice 75 feet long had
come down and was
causing more trouble.
It was decided to use
smaller shots of dyna-
mite in future oper-
ations.
Shortly after this
date is was decided to discontinue the dynamiting,
as little was accomplished compared to the amount
used, and it was thought better, in view of the
r;:pid work progressing with the thermit in weak-
ening the lower gorge, to reserve the remaining
stock of dynamite for any emergency that might
arise. The bleeding of the ice hindered the men
from making the holes for the dynamite.
CALCIUM CHLORIDE TREATMENT
As much salt as possible was gathered from the
road department, and it was decided to open up
three-inch channels under the Big Rock bridge.
On the 6th, Mr. Frame reported that 1,600
pounds of calcium chloride had been put in the
channel under the bridge, making lines 2,000 feet
long.
No further use was made of calcium chloride,
pending the decision to order a fresh supply. The
action of the material already laid was watched
with much interest, and it was expected that the
weakening of the ice under the bridge would help
to relieve the pressure on the piers.
ASH, SAND AND GRAVEL
On March 5, it was reported that one carload of
cinders would be spread at places along the chan-
nel as would be suggested by the writer. On
March 8, one carload of cinders was unloaded at
East Sandy, 300 yards being laid along the chan-


Page 25
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
nel at that time. Arrangements were made with
the Atlantic Refining Company, of Franklin, for a
carload of ashes to be taken by the New York
Central and dumped off the bridge at East Sandy
on the ice, the Atlantic Refining Company do-
nating the ashes and the New York Central their
train service.
The report on March 9 showed that the carload
of ashes was dumped on the ice at 9:30 a. m. They
were spread 50 yards up the river and 350 yards
below Camel Hump to a width of 15 yards. The
action was noticed to make slush ice by drawing
the heat of the sun.
Report on March 10 that seven men were em-
ployed in spreading ashes, 275 yards were spread
up the river and 25 yards down. Around both piers
of the bridge cinders were placed 12 feet. The ice
was found not stuck on the east side of the west
pier, Cinders spread the day before had penetrated
the ice from a half inch to one inch.
On March 11, the men employed in spreading
gravel were used in assisting the dynamiting op-
erations, as after this date no further ashes or
gravel were used, and it was found the ice cov-
ered by the gravel gradually showed water on the
surface. No further application of gravel was
made, as the thermit was producing such great
effects.
THE THERMIT OPERATIONS
The writer will now try to give some idea of
the way in which the general attack on the gorge
was carried out with the use of the thermit heat
units.
Some experimenting had to be done during the
first few days on the writer's arrival. Special con-
tainers were constructed by Mr. J. P. Coffman,
superintendent of the National Transit Pump and
Machinery Company, of Oil City. Arrangements
were kindly made by Mr. Coffman to have the
containers loaded at the shops. Before the con-
tainers were finished, some charges were prepared
in 10-gallon oil barrels.
After a careful survey of the gorge, the writer
laid out the points of greatest resistance in the old
jam below Franklin which had resisted the on-
slaught of the second gorge. These points were
about five to six miles apart, beginning at the foot
of the pack. No attempt was made to treat the
upper pack from Franklin to Oil City, because
this was being weakened by the effect of the open
water above Oil City at the head of the jam. The
sun's heat was being carried into the pack, and
the greatest danger lay in this upper ice under
high water shoving down on the older pack, still
hard and solid, and causing great damage to the
city of Franklin, situated in the jaws of the mass.
The water, when it reached the lower pack, had
had its heat all taken out of it by passing through
the upper pack, and hence its melting action was
reduced to a small amount. The entire gorge was
divided into two parts. The lower, represented by
the older gorge, which was dry and grounded with
the water forcing its way around through side
channels, and the newer gorge, lifted high on flood
waters accumulating above Franklin. The object
of the first thermit treatment was not to dislodge
the ice, as the dynamiting operations had shown
the uselessness of this while the cold weather
lasted, but to open channels under the surface.
The water had to be brought down into the old
pack and by its presence do two things; relieve the
flood level above, and afford water enough to lift
the lower ice and get it ready to be passed on
down the river without gorging and causing more
floods.
With this in view, all work was concentrated on
the heavy packs and the thermit containers fired
as low down in the ice masses as possible. The
liberation of this great heat had the effect of burn-
ing out great areas under the ice, and the force
of the explosions, which resulted from the heated
metal in contact with the ice and water, caused
cracks and disruption which allowed the water to
force its way through these places under a high
head and gradually work its way down, clearing
and melting a channel much larger than was evi-
dent to the eye at the time.
In the accompanying curve figure No. 8, it will
be seen how the levels of water at Franklin and
Oil City dropped after the thermit was applied.
Each charge was noticed to produce its effect in
reducing the flood water.
With the fall of water in the upper pack there
was a rise of level in the lower end, and care had
to be taken not to let the water down too fast so
as to avoid flooding the Pennsylvania Railroad
tracks at the lower part of the gorge.
All of the time up to March 18 was taken up
with intelligent use of the thermit at the critical
points and the operations regulated by the writer
from the daily watch of the flood levels. The drop
in level occurred simultaneously with the thermit
treatment,
From the 10th to the 20th, when the weather
turned very mild, the gorge was held in control
in this way, and the whole pack was observed to
move very slowly downward as the water was
brought down. From this glacial-like movement
much valuable information was obtained as to the
hardest and most resistant points. By the 20th,
great areas had opened up, and it was found de-
sirable to begin the final attack to remove the
gorge. The writer was criticized for not taking
the ice out at once, but this was unwise, for rea-
sons already given. The whole situation was under
control and the river levels held down until such

THE GYRO'S STRANGE INTUITIONS
By KLMER A. SPERRY, Vice-Chairman, Engineering Foundation
UNKJUE and even wonderful are certain char-
acteristics of the gyroscope. Suppose we
had a circle with one chair occupied by a
gyroscope instead of mere man, and imagine he
could speak to us. Let me tell you some of the
interesting things that he would pipe up and say:
"I know things that none of you mortals are in
the least aware of. For example, I know that this
chair in which I sit is moving, I can feel its direc-
tion and tell you its velocity. I am sure none of
you has any intuitive sense of these things, but I
know them instinctively. It is also easy for me to
discern the difference between unilinear motion and
circular motion, or motion around a center, no mat-
ter how remote or distant this center may be. As
a matter of fact, this motion that I feel is around
a very remote center—some 4,(XX) miles away—and
if you stop to think, this involves an axis of mo-
tion. The exact direction in which this axis lies
with reference to this city, this room, and even
the chair in which 1 sit, is quite apparent to me."
The astonished circle look at each other and can-
not refrain from commenting that such information
is not only remarkable, but might become extreme-
ly useful. It would be of the utmost usefulness to
the mariner if we could make the little gyro ar-
ticulate in terms that could be universally under-
stood, because if we only knew with a high degree
of precision exactly the direction of the axis of the
earth, this would at once give the precise direc-
tion of all meridians. If our point be moving, as a
ship either in the water or in the air, this infor-
mation could give us the exact position of our
meridian at all times and places.
So it has been one of the objects of the last thirty
years of my life to make the gyro articulate and to
check up on him rather critically, (1) as to the
exact degree of his precision, (2) as to his being
perfectly understood, and (3) to safeguard him
against disturbances due to the various and some-
times violent motions of his mount. This has
gone forward until the time has come when the
great value of such a safeguard to accurate navi-
gation, especially under conditions where observa-
tions are impossible, has become more and more
understood.
It is comforting to know that as our little gyro
goes humming on his way, this precision orienta-
tion which through his sixth sense he so freely
and cheerfully dispenses, is based on a definite
"field" that he employs as his energizing force,
which is all pervasive and never failing. There is
no place on the earth that does not revolve and
there is no place where he does not feel the urge
to service, except possibly at or near the actual
pole on the ice cap, where he shakes his head and
says, "What is the use of pointing to any one
meridian, for here they all are, together with the
pole itself."
If anyone challenges his accuracy or value, there
are some 2,000 of his brothers distributed in over
one hundred fleets, largely merchant marine, that
will stoutly enter instant and convincing proof, and
if one wishes to push investigation still farther
and Comprehend the marvelous training that he
has received through long aeons, coming down
through the centuries with his intuitions tuned to
the nth degree, I have only to call attention to
the wonderful sensitiveness of his response to in-
fluences that are really infinitesimal. The preces-
sion velocity of gyros varies. Quite large stabil-
izing gyros for ships precess at measurably one
radian; other services often require many radians.
One recently manufactured for the testing labora-
tories of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
precesses at between 20 and 30 radians. It is well
known that the ability of the gyro to respond to
directional forces is proportional to the angular
velocity that reaches him, expressed, say, in ra-
dians, and think of how sensitive have become his
faculties when I tell you that the earth is enabled
to hold him in complete thraldom, reaching him,
as he does, with only 1/14,000 of a radian.
His embodiment and the devices that are em-
ployed to render his articulation completely under-
standable to all men is the gyro-compass, which
is found by mariners to be entirely devoid of all
the vagaries that obsess the magnetic compass and
render it unreliable, especially on steel ships, One
fundamental difficulty with the magnetic compass
is that it feebly points to the constantly moving
north magnetic pole, which averages some 1,80.')
miles down from the true pole that we have to
use in all navigation.
The gyro compass is the prime controlling force
of its many "repeaters" distributed at all navi-
gational, radio and observation stations on a ship,
as well as of the course recorder. It also con-
stitutes the directing force of "Metal Mike," which
now automatically steers practically all great ships
of the merchant marine, many of them having
made the cruise around the world. So modern
science has taught us how we may both lay out
and hold our great fleets on the straightest course
ever, without the hand of man, and, strange as it
may seem, they are actually steered by the steady
and unfailing rotation of the earth.

THREE GENERATIONS
(Continued from page 6.)
Most everybody wants to be a boss over some-
body or something. Every college graduate knows
that he is chosen by the deity to be a big boss.
Fortunately a great host of people are satisfied to
be the bosses over machines. I saw a black-eyed
Neapolitan bossing a mechanical sewer digger the
other day. He was sitting atop the world. In post-
volsteadian language he was "getting a big kick."
In father's day he was down in the ditch with a
pick, and the kick he got came from the Irish
foreman.
The machine makes every man a boss. Do not,
•worry too much about what our contemporary
sociologists are deploring. Machinery is not mak-
ing morons, but is helping morons to make a de-
cent living.
Some things we did in this labor dilemma we do
not shout about so much now. Once we had a
great movement called "Welfare Work." That
word welfare has been expunged from the dic-
tionary. As the chemist would say, it was too
labile. It was subject to syllabic inversion. The
trouble with us was insincerity. We think you are
sincere. It is your great asset. Don't lose it. You
will need it in the job of cleaning up after us.
We think the fathers left a mess for us. We
are sure we had the goods on them. You will
think we are leaving a mess for you to clean up,
but, confidentially, if the old folks had not left
something for us we would have been very sore.
They gave us our opportunity. We are giving you
yours and plenty of it.
The burden of this testament is that the college
trained man and woman are the saviors of human
society. We know you think so and it is good for
you to feel such a responsibility. We thought so
about ourselves, but we let you in on another great
secret. You will not have to do it all alone. We
didn't. When we started out to sot the world on
fire, we found some very competent associate in-
cendiaries. These fellows had not been anointed
like us with extreme academic unction, but they
knew how to keep the fires burning hot. They did
a lot of the things we like to boast about. It was
one of those fellows who put the four wheels under
each citizen.
While we have not always been as generous
toward them as we ought, we are secretly glad
that some of the great institutions of learning like
the University of Michigan are publicly recogniz-
ing them by sticking the sacred academic tail
feather in their hats.
You will find another generation of them ready
to help you when you take up your task. Treat
them like brothers for you never can tell when one
of them will be your boss.
MOTOR FUEL
(Continued from page 10.)
ing gasoline according to specifications: (1) Water
white color; (2) odor removal; (3) negative to the
doctor test; and (4) sulphur 0.100.15 per cent.
There are still specifications which demand a
water-white gasoline but as far as the perform-
ance of gasoline in an automotive cylinder is con-
cerned color means nothing. However, it means
something to the refiner who has to acid treat out
certain colored components which are only present
in traces, but in taking out the traces there is a
material loss not alone in gasoline but also in its
properties as an anti-knock motor fuel. It is a
happy sign when one drives about the country to
see in visible bowls not alone yellow gasoline but
pink, red, green and blue in addition to water
white. The motor is no respecter of color and will
operate as well with yellow as with water white,
blue, green or red gasoline. It may well develop
that special gasolines will be put on the market
to match the color of the car or as one refiner in
Kentucky who plans a blue gasoline, naming it
"Blue Grass Gasoline."
Odor is another test that is too rigidly adhered
to and really has little place in a specification for
gasoline. To bring an average cracked gasoline to
so-called good odor is wasteful of chemicals and
adds to the loss of actual gasoline.
The doctor test is one to determine the so-called
sourness of a gasoline due to the sulphur com-
pounds present. It has been shown that the doctor
test does not react with all sulphur compounds
present in a gasoline for there may be substantial
percentages of sulphur present which is not dis-
closed at all by this test. On the other hand with
no sulphur compounds present in the gasoline the
doctor test may show it to be sour. Hence this
test has no real importance as disclosing the value
of a motor fuel and should be eliminated.
The removal of sulphur from gasoline, particu-
larly those containing percentages as high as one,
is an expensive procedure not alone in the cost of
chemicals but also in the loss of valuable gasoline.
In the refining of a one per cent sulphur-content
gasoline a loss of 20 per cent of gasoline resulted
when meeting a market specification of fifteen-
hundredths of one per cent.
Less than one-half of this loss would be en-
countered using approximately one-half the amount
of chemicals, if the specifications were three-tenths
per cent sulphur or above. It is not clear where
motor difficulties ensue as a function of increasing
percentages of sulphur in the gasoline. It would
appear as if one-tenth of one per cent sulphur in
a specification is an arbitrary upper limit for east-
ern gasolines and the whole subject of sulphur
toleration in gasoline should be thoroughly studied.

Since the advent of the ventilation system in crank-
cases of motor cars, condensation of moisture
therein is prevented, hence no sulphurous or sul-
phuric acid could form therein. The combustion of
sulphur to sulfur dioxide and trioxide gives out
energy and functions like any other gas in a motor.
Fuel oil of high sulphur content is satisfactorily
burned in a Diesel engine, hence the sulphur com-
pounds in gasoline should burn satisfactorily.
The sulphur toleration in motor fuel should be
at least 0.3 or 0.4 per cent, and in view of the
ventilator system for crankcases it would appear
that almost any sulphur-content motor fuel could
be used without corrosion difficulties developing,
due to the fact that the ventilator system on the
crankcase will take out the sulphur dioxide and tri-
oxide which results from the combustion of the
sulphur.
Hence there will be no sulphurous and sulphuric
acid being pumped through the circulatory system
of lubricating oils.
The anti-knock properties of cracked gasoline
expressed in terms of benzol equivalent range be-
tween approximately twenty-five to over fifty per
cent benzol added to straight-run Pennsylvania
motor fuel.
INDUSTRY
(Continued from page 12.)
the last things its leaders are considering. I am
sure you will all agree with me that if we in the
foundry industry had been thinking of nothing but
profits for the last five years, our minds would
have been largely a vacuum. Industry is thinking
of the things it is making, of cylinder blocks and
manifolds, of more automobiles, or more houses,
of more anything it can sell to society to supply
society's wants, and 1 suspect that one change
which is coming during the next few years is that
the leaders of industrial life will have to think, not
less of profits, but more of them, that they will
have to begin to pav some attention to the per-
fectly proper reimbursement of those who as stock-
holders have contributed their stored-up labor in
the form of capital.
You remember the story of ancient mythology,
of how the philosophers thought of Jupiter and
the other Gods as dwelling apart on Olympus, and
how, in order to establish a system of communi-
cation between themselves, and also between
Olympus, and the Earth, they conceived of a youth
with lithe limbs, who acted as the messenger of
the Gods. You will remember that their sculptors
produced in marble the beautiful form of this mes-
senger, and added wings to his feet and that today
when we think of an emblem of speed we still use
the "winged foot."
Modern industry has dreamed of this same ques-
tion of communication and of transportation, but
when it has thought of it, it has gone, not to the
chisel and the block of marble to create a symbol
which couldn't move, but rather to the hissing
spark and the throbbing engine. The modern man,
with this philosophy for communication, gathering
his family beside him in front of the fireplace, and
throwing a wire above his house, dreams not of
the Gods, but actually hears their voice, carried
through the ether in song or speech. The aero-
,plane isn't a thing of steel and wood and fabric.
It's the answer to man's age-old dream that some
day he should fly. The radio isn't a thing of wires
and bulbs. It's the answer to the longing of man-
kind that it should hear the human voice from far-
off distant spaces. The engine under the hood of
anv motor car is the answer to a thousand dreams
of men who sought to produce that which would
be of more service to their fellowmen. The world
never before knew so many dreamers as industry
contains, and the fact that they work not with can-
vas or marble, but rather with camshafts and con-
necting rods, doesn't fundamentally change the
character of their work, but the great difference is
that while the dream of the ancients died a dream,
the dream of modern industry comes true, and that
coming brings more of ease, more of comfort, more
of happiness to the human race.
Twenty-four years ago, in Old University Hall,
as a representative of the Senior Class in the Uni-
versity oratorical contest, I presented a piece whose
opening sentence read, "I am to speak to you to-
night of one of the greatest constructive forces of
all history, that spirit of trade which we call com-
mercialism."
Looking back through almost a quarter of a cen-
tury spent in active industrial life, privileged to
meet through the great associations of industry,
many of its great leaders, and to see i-nto its real
heart, I make bold to reaffirm the statement then
made, and to hold that no branch of human en-
deavor contains more of promise for the future of
the human race, both from the material and from
the spiritual aspect, than does that represented by
modern industry, of which we are each one a part.
In closing, I want to give you a few verses of
a poem, which perhaps I should have done in the
beginning and spared you the rest, for it really
covers all I have said:
BUSINESS IS BUSINESS
"Business is Business," the Little Man said.
"A battle where 'everything goes.'
Where the only gospel is 'get ahead'
And never spare friends or foes;
'Slay or be slain' is the slogan cold,
You must struggle and slash and tear,
For Business is Business, a fight for gold,
Where all that vou do is fair!"


Page 29

"Business is Business," the Big Man said,
"A battle to make of earth
A place to yield us more wine and hread.
More pleasure and joy and mirth;
There are still somc bandits and buccaneers
Who are jungle-bred beasts of trade,
But their number dwindles with passing years
And dead is the code they made."
"Business is Business," the Big Man said,
"But it's something that's more, far more;
For it makes sweet gardens of deserts dead,
And cities it built now roar
Where once the deer and gray wolf ran
From the pioneers' swift advance;
Business is Magic that toils for man.
Business is True Romance.
"And those who make it a ruthless fight
Have only themselves to blame
If they feel no whit of the keen delight
In playing the Bigger (iame,
The game that calls on the heart and head,
The best of man's strength and nerve.
"Business is Business," the Big Man said,
"And that Business is to serve!"

ing such as one experiences on hoard ship, the
unrest of New York is a startling contrast. The
beauty is of a totally different kind and it is per-
fectly proper that it should be. The masses of sky-
scrapers enveloped in the smoky haze and tiie
panting of the tugs and the bustling of the docks
is just as truly expressive of the life that is a part
of this country as the little two-storied, half-tim-
bered houses of centuries ago in which the same
families have lived for generations are expressive
• if the life that the people live in them. We live in
the present and the future while they seem to
live in the past.
DESIGN ENGINEERING
(Continued from page 16.)
nomena, especially when that analysis yields a
complete explanation of the puzzle. Design work
is based on analysis and involves digging out the
answers to a succession of puzzles, with corre-
sponding mental stimulus and satisfaction. Next,
the desire for recognition of attainment: Recog-
nition is compelled by successful accomplishment
in design work. The machine runs or the apparatus
functions successfully and is talked about and ap-
preciated, is discussed in technical papers, and
finally wins its designer a place as an authority in
his line, with corresponding honor and satisfaction
to him. His material compensation also grows
correspondingly. The instinct to render service is
well taken care of because it may be gathered from
the above that the designing engineer is constantly
rendering service of all kinds and degrees to all
other parts of his own organization and to the

public at large. Inde,ed, we may generalize at this
point and say that the reason engineering of any
kind whatever is so satisfying to the engineer is
that he is never doubtful whether he is rendering
a full measure of practical service to his gener-
ation. In the last place, consider self-preservation.
Outside of fending off impending physical dangers
and keeping clothed, housed, and fed, what form
does this instinct take? Is it not the preservation
of one's integrity as an individual; the proving that
the world is better for one's presence, and that one
fills an economic need? If so, who is better quali-
fied to feel safe on these points than the design en-
gineer—who analyzes problems of industry and
everyday life—who creates solutions for these
problems—who feels that he is rendering service

in so doing—and who gains gratifying recognition
for his work?
Such then, briefly, is the work of the designing
engineer. Without exaggeration and ,vithout ideal-
ization, I have tried to tell some things that it is
not, and many things that it is.
I have spent twenty-four years of my own life
following various phases of design work on elec-
trical apparatus, and I have no hesitation in urging
qualified young men to take it up as one of the
most thoroughly satisfying of all the opportunities
for work which lie before them.
FURNITURE MAKING
(Continued from page 19.)
niture Co., of Grand Rapids, the largest and one of
the most widely' known manufacturers of high
grade furniture in the country, the writer was
able to go through the largest unit of their plant.
Fortunately his guide was a young man from
one of the outer offices who didn,t know too
much about the manufacturing end of the busi-
ness, and was content to answer questions in-
stead of burying his charge under a bewildering
heap of facts and figures. He merely led the
way, avoiding with nice discretion the more des-
tructive-looking saws and planers, and allowing the
spectacle to speak for itself far more eloquently
than he could have spoken for it.
There were five or six floors of the huge build-
ing, there were several acres of floor-space on each.
There were dozens of marvelously clever machines,
hundreds of workmen and what seemed to be
millions of chairs, tables, buffets and so on in the
various stages of completion. For a bit it was only
immense and rather confusing, but as one ascend-
ed to floor after floor and began to get a grasp
of the business as a whole, there was revealed the
essential quality in this modern method of pro-
ducing the sort of furniture one likes to possess
which makes it far more like the workshop of the
cabinet-maker than the clattering, wholly mechan-
ical shop engaged in turning out basket-rims or
pick-handles by the gross.
In this business the machine has not supplanted
the work of the craftsman, it has merely been
handed to him for his assistance, to perform for
him the cruder parts of his task, which consumed
so much of his time and energy in the old days,
leaving him free for that more exacting, meticulous
labor of which he is the master. For instance,
in one of the first rooms visited, a whole battery of
droning saws was engaged in ripping big slabs of
wood into wafer-like sheets to be used in veneering.
It was not a part of the process calling for any very
high degree of skill. The machines had to be
watched, the slabs had to be fed into them—that
was all. They accomplished their work with
amazing swiftness and beautiful precision, they
piled up a huge cordon of veneering sheets in a
fraction of the time a man would have needed to
do it by hand, and they performed the task with
a tireless mathematical exactness which would
have been beyond the powers of a master-carpen-
ter. And why waste good man-power and good
brains on a phase of the job which can be done
infinitely better by machinery.
So in a dozen other rooms visited: chair-legs,
table-legs, buffet-panels, all being put through the
first stages of transformation from rough wood
to finished product by machines operated by the
same sort of workman you might find at the lathe
or grinding-machine of any machine-shop. Every-
where the same evidences of parts produced in
great numbers—stacks of chair-backs, enough of
them to accommodate the audience of a big foot-
ball game or a national convention, truck-loads of
half-finished legs, no more than suggestion of their
ultimate shape and finish upon their surfaces, piles
of seasoned lumber coming in from the yards out-
side.
But go through a doorway or climb a flight of
stairs and there was a new note, a different atmos-
phere, another race of workmen—and women.
A single glance around one of the big rooms where
some of the finishing and hand-carving is being
done is enough to banish forever the mistaken
notion that the end and aim of quantity, machine-
made production is to give no more than a specious
imitation of the conscientiously hand-made article.
The men who were doing the relief-work on beau-
tiful end-panels, fitting together the joints of ex-
pensive bedroom pieces, gluing together the thin
sheets of veneered wood, imparting the final polish
to the surfaces of tables, brushing on the stripes
and curves of decorative design on ultra-modern
painted pieces—all these men were working wholly
by hand, working with that seeming slowness
which is the perfectly gauged speed of the artisan
who gives nothing but his best efforts and knows
perfectly the maximum speed at which it can be
expended.
Here one encountered the elderly cabinet-maker,
a little dried, a little bent, often watching his work
through big spectacles, as like as not speaking with
thick traces of a foreign accent. And near him,
painting flowers on the smooth-surface of a paint-
ed bedside table, was a bobbed-hair girl in a blouse
—just as intent at her work, just as painstaking in
every motion, just as thoroughly a member of
the furniture-makers' guild. After a walk through
two or three floors devoted to such operations, it
was easy to understand why the city has attracted
experts from all corners of'the world.
And again and again there were evidences of
the complete and intelligent cooperation between


Page 31
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
men and the machine. In places chairs and tables
and other articles were revolving on pivots while
workmen put on the first coats of paint or varnish
with a spray—but a few feet away the finishing
coats were being done by hand. Huge mechanical
polishers were smoothing the surfaces of glistening
dining-tables—but every one of them went under
the pumice-stone and horny hands of an expert
before it was done.
To confine this account of the fashion in which
Grand Rapids has made Michigan "the furniture
State of the Union" as it has won for itself the
title of "Furniture Capital of America" by no
more than this brief historical sketch of the in-
dustry's growth and even briefer glimpse of the
modern methods of manufacture would be to give
no more than a part of the picture. Making good
furniture is only one step in the process. Even
celling good furniture does not complete the story.
What the industry has attempted and accomplished
(and here appears the visible evidence of the high
standards of production and long-sighted acuteness
on the part of the first manufacturer) is to create
and keep educated an ever higher and more dis-
criminating taste in furniture on the part of the
public at large.
The growth of an industry is to a certain extent
cumulative. It took years of hard work in the
teeth of trying conditions to establish in a corner
of southwestern Michigan the center of the furni-
ture-making industry of the country. But once
the stronghold had been made practically safe
against future attacks of competitors, a good bit
of the increase continued without any attempts
on the part of the manufacturers to produce it.
Furniture designers, skilled wood-workers, gravi-
tated toward Grand Rapids and nearby towns
where other factories had been established as steel-
workers move toward Pittsburgh and playwrights
gather on Broadway.
Long before Michigan had reached a high place
in the matter of quantity production of furniture,
the center of the industry had won for it a name
for quality products. Through the combined in-
fluences of clever designers, ambitious manufac-
turers and an ever more prosperous population
among whom the desire for better furnished and
more beautiful homes was constantly increasing,
there came into being the Grand Rapids Market
Association—an institution in many ways unique.
The furniture exhibition of January, 1916, was
the first one shown under the auspices of the new
association, but the seventy-sixth consecutive one
to be given in Grand Rapids. This market was at-
tended by ll(K) buyers and about 100 different lines
of furniture were displayed. In January of 1924,
at the 94th consecutive market, there were present
more than 3000 buyers, and the number of dis-
plays had increased to well over 500.
These exhibitions must not be regarded as
merely the fine flower of a well trained and effi-
cient selling organization: selling Grand Rapids
and Michigan-made furniture is only one of their
objects. They seek to give to those who attend
them a liberal and complete education in furniture
and interior furnishings of all sorts, artistic as well
as technical. They would like to have retail
dealers fill their stores mainly with the best obtain-
able types of furniture, but at the same time they
strive to educate the public into desiring it instead
of being satisfied to club them into buying it.
Nor are the Furniture Markets, which occur
twice a year, in January and in June-July, confined
to Grand Rapids or Michigan manufacturers. Sta-
tistics on a recent exhibition reveal their cosmo-
politan nature. The number of exhibitors and
the states represented were as follows:
Michigan 132 Pennsylvania .,.,. 37
New York 76 Massachusetts ,,,. 12
Indiana 64 Kentucky 11
Illinois 56 Tennessee 11
Ohio 45 Virginia 10
North Carolina .,.. 38 Minnesota 9
In addition to the above list, there was a scat-
tering of exhibits from several other states, while
buyers were in attendance from Cuba, Canada,
Mexico, Hawaii, England, France and even South
Africa, as well as from every State in the Union.
Any attempt at a list of the Michigan concerns
engaged in the manufacture of furniture, or any of
those articles whose production has become so
'closely connected with the industry as to be practi-
cally part of it, is out of the question. As was
stated at the very outset, it is impossible to talk
of furniture without doing so largely in terms of
Grand Rapids. When it is stated that of the
132 Michigan exhibitors at the Market quoted
above, the factories of 68 were located in Grand
Rapids, the extent to which the industry has be-
come centralized in the city is at once apparent.
But it has spread throughout the State to such a
degree that an alphabetical list of the towns and
cities in which furniture is manufactured might
almost be copied exactly from any good atlas of
Michigan.
Even brief discussions of great industries seem
incomplete without imposing rows and columns of
statistics. Many of these might be incorporated
in the present article, and yet they would add little
to its interest. Any industry which has grown to
such dimensions from small and precarious begin-
nings, which is so closely connected with every-
day home-life, which has brought the State to the
very head of the front rank in its field production,
which has preserved an ancient and honorable

craft in the midst of modern mechanical conditions,
and which builds its increasing and continued suc-
cess on a solid basis of improved public taste and
wide-spread prosperity, needs no formidable list
of earnings and volume of business to prove its
position among the great commercial enterprises
of Michigan.
ACCELEROMETER
(Continued from page 21.)
insure current nearly enough proportional to ap-
plied I). C. voltages, then the e.m.f. induced in
the secondary is proportional to the rate of change
of voltage and may be used to operate a vacuum
tube amplifier. We have made a preliminary in-
vestigation and feel that it will be necessary to
use a homopolar generator (such a machine may
be built within reasonable dimensions) and that a
satisfactory two-stage resistance coupled amplifier
can be built that will operate the most sensitive
type of electro-magnetic oscillograph element.
Another interesting application is automotive
testing. I understand that accelerometers some-
what similar to ours have been developed for this
work but I have not been able to find more than
a passing reference to them in the technical liter-
ature. The article referred to in footnote 2 ap-
parently had such an application in view.
I should like to point out here that the state-
ment in the latter part of that article regarding
special errors of electrical accelerometers seems a
bit misleading. It should be apparent from the
differential equations applicable to both the elec-
trical and mechanical cases that any accelerometer,
except one making use of a null method of meas-
urement, such as the contact accelerometer pre-set
to the wanted acceleration, lags in its indications
behind the actual accelerations to be recorded.
Whenever the need arises in my work I expect to
consider both electrical and mass-and-spring types,
pending further published work. It is interesting
to note that satisfactory damping is frequently
more easily arranged with the electrical type. In-
cidentally, our somewhat crude electrical accelero-
meter finds its significant error to be due to its
mechanical system carrying the mirror.
One other application of interest to this de-
partment is the one referred to recently in the
discussion of the deceleration tests of the Niagara
Falls generators. We have not investigated this
application carefully but we would like to suggest
that in view of the small acceleration involved and
hence the large condenser capacity required the
quality of the condensers should be looked to very
carefully indeed. A comparatively small direct con-
ductance current would affect results materially.
ICE ENGINEERING
(Continued from page 25.)
time as nature could aid in the removal of the ice,
On the afternoon of the 20th, the upper pack
began to move under the weakening action of the
sun. This was a little sooner than the writer had
expected, and in consequence new tactics had to
be adopted. Everyone thought that the entire
gorge would move out, but so strong was the ice
still holding between Oil City and Franklin that it
gorged into the ice at that point under a high head
of water without moving beyond Reno. The citi-
zens had a taste of what might have occurred to
them in a much worse way had not the lower
gorge been opened and the previous flood waters
taken away. A considerable flood ensued at Oil
City, although Franklin did not experience this
flood in the least.
The same night the waters began to rise, and
early the following day Oil City was in flood,
with rain falling. The Reno traction bridge was
in grave danger, and stood 18 inches off its piers,
resting on the ice, while the power house was
partially submerged and in grave danger also.
On Monday, March 21, two heavy charges of
thermit were set off at the two points in the new
jam at Reno where the pack was greatest, and
these were effective in relieving the flood in Oil
City, and were so gauged as to put the Reno
bridge safely back on its piers without damage of
any kind.
On that day, March 21, more thermit was rushed
from Pittsburgh by motor truck and special train,
and all night long the men worked heroically to
fill containers for the morning.
On Tuesday, additional charges were inserted
in the pack to bring the ice level down to a safe
distance below the bridge, and then a concentrated
attack was made on the gorge to remove it en-
tirely.
Two thermit crews were sent out, one below
Franklin at Indian Bend, the last remaining point
of resistance, and the other to loosen the pack
holding between Oil City and Franklin.
The men in charge of the work, Messrs. George
L. Bannon and Fred Wenner, deserve the greatest
praise for the courageous way in which they went
at the attack in the rain and bad weather. The
ice was none too firm to go on to place the
charges, and frequently planks had to be used to
effect a safe passage.
Under the terrific action of these thermit charges,
the gorge was shaken loose in great patches and
sent down the river safely, the lower pack giving
just ahead of the upper, thus avoiding any flood-
ing except for a short time at Indian Bend, where
some of the track embankment was washed out.
This was from the great rush of water from the


Page 33
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
upper pack meeting the resistance of the slowly-
moving ice below. Very little damage was done,
however, and by 6:30 o'clock in the evening the
ice was all moving on down easily, and by late
evening the river levels at both Oil City and
Franklin were back to normal.
The United States Army engineers at Pitts-
burgh, who never at any time understood the func-
tion of the thermit
treatment, had predict-
ed the worst flood in
the history of Oil City,
with the rain and warm
weather. This predic-
tion, like their earlier
ones, was not fulfilled.
Had the gorge been
left to nature, as they
had urged, then their
predictions would have
doubtless come true,
but under the scientific
treatment accorded the
ice in the gorge was re-
moved without dam-
age.
On Sunday night,
March 21, two spans of
the Big Rock bridge were taken out by the ice
movement, but this could not have been prevented
as the understructure, which had been condemned
as unsafe, was a prey to the slowly-moving ice and
the flood waters above. It was a matter of great
satisfaction to the writer that no loss of life or
iniury resulted from the whole operation, and the
property damage was comparatively small, com-
pared with what it might have been.
COMMENTS ON THE WORK
It is but fair to review some of the comments
of the engineers and others who were in close
touch with the whole fight.
General Manager V. A. Redfield, of the Trac-
tion Company, stated to the press that "Credit for
saving the Reno bridge and for diverting the ice
pack to the opposite side of the river, saving the
switching equipment and preventing tremendous
loss of property, resulting in interruption of serv-
ice of a far more serious nature, is given to Dr.
Howard T. Barnes. It is quite evident that the
wall of water backing up on Monday evening was
not great enough to move the big jam, which could
only be placed in motion by a still greater head of
flood. The thermit crew, in charge of the Mon-
treal scientist, devoted practically all of their ef-
forts on Monday to attacking the ice below Reno
on the opposite side of the river from the West
End power house. This caused a gradual weaken-
ing of the pack below the surface of the ice, with
PLACING ONE OF THE FIRST HEAT UNITS UNDER THE
WRITER'S DIRECTION.
the result that the field moved out on the opposite
side of the river, avoiding the transformer yard
and its intricate network of switches and other
protective equipment and sparing Oil City and
Franklin a far more serious interruption of elec-
tric service. As it was, the first movement of the
ice resulted in a sudden movement which sheared
off one of the big steel towers at the power house,
carrying away the 11,-
000-volt supply lines to
Franklin."
Another comment in
the Pennsylvania
News, and written by
Mr. Shingledecker, of
the Pennsylvania Rail-
road: "We can now re-
view a bit. People will
never forget the gruel-
1 i n g experiences o f
those three days, be-
ginning Sunday morn-
ing, March 21, and end-
ing Tuesday night,
March 23, only after
Dr. Barnes had shaken
and virtually burned
the packs to pieces
with heat mines. Thermit was rushed to Oil City
over the Pennsylvania Railroad, arriving at 9 p. m.
on March 22. All night a force worked to prepare
the containers for a desperate attack on the two
gorges the following day. With organized crews,
Dr. Barnes launched a desperate effort against the
great mass of ice. Fifteen shots were placed in the
011 City gorge during the day and four in the Bran-
don pack. Hour after hour the crews risked their
lives to place heat mines. The Brandon pack broke
at 5 :40 p. m. and the Oil City gorge followed at 6:35
p. in., an hour after the thermit crews were driven
to shore. With the aid of thermit, the gorges moved
ahead of a wall of water three feet lower than the
great volume the day before."
Superintendent J. J. Rhoads, of the Pennsyl-
vania Railroad, issued the following statement on
March 22: "I attribute the 31-inch drop in the
river at Oil City to the use of thermit in the vi-
cinity of Reno."
The following day, after conferring with Di-
vision Engineer W. S. Wilson and Supervisor J.
T. Ridgley, Superintendent Rhoads issued another
statement, as follows: "That the Allegheny Di-
vision's loss is not much greater, we attribute to
Dr. Barnes' work, and in each case where the heat
mines were used, the river level dropped within
j2 hours. The entire community of Oil City and
Franklin, as well as the Allegheny Division, were

fortunate in having at their disposal the services
of Dr. Barnes."
It might be well to add that the work was not
carried on without many difficulties, and as the
people of both cities were not familiar with the
scientific method of doing such work it was not
easy to have them understand what the writer was
really going to do to help the situation. One ques-
tion was raised as to whether the thermit would
poison the water and the fish, so the medical health
officer of Pennsylvania rushed there to have an
interview with the writer, and, if necessary, to stop
the work.
Engineers did not realize that there were not
one or two ice packs, but a number of packs, and
that the key to each of these separate jams had to
be treated to have the work carried on success-
fully.
The whole cost of the operations was under six
thousand dollars, which was insignificant compared
to the value of the property saved. The saving of
the Reno bridge alone was sufficient to justify the
expenditure.
REPORT TO THE U. S. GOVERNMENT
The Ordnance Department of the United States
Army appointed Reserve Officer Major H. B.
Faber to make an official inspection of the writer's
operations in removing the ice gorge. Accord-
ingly, Major Faber came out to Oil City, and
was present during the last two days of the work.
He witnessed the final removal of the ice. His re-
port was sent in to Washington and is on file as
an official document of the War Office.
The report is of an entirely favorable character,
as he was very much impressed by the whole pro-
cedure, characterizing it as "amazing."
Even after the gorge had gone out, the United
States Army engineers at Pittsburgh sent out a
bulletin to the effect that the ice had gone out
under the pressure of high water, without giving
;&gt;nv credit to the thermit operations. This, as will
be apparent by reading the text of this paper, was
not true, for the gorge withstood the highest water
in the history of Oil City without moving for
nearly 18 hours, and it was only when the flood
level had been reduced to a safe point with ther-
mit treatment that the ice was moved out. Then
the movement was effected from the lower gorge
first, which quite reverses the way these accumu-
lations usually move. Had the lower gorge been
left to nature, there is no knowing when it would
have moved, since it was gathering no heat from
the waters above except a little from French creek
at Franklin. But it is well not to speculate on
what would have happened to the city of Franklin
under these conditions, as it was just at the meet-
ing-place of the old and new gorges. It must be
pointed out in comparison that the Kinzua gorge,
60 miles above Oil Citv, which was feared would
come down any time, never moved out at all, but
melted in place, the water making new channels
around it.
At the beginning of the work, the writer paid
a visit to Kinzua, and after a careful inspection
gave it as his opinion that there was no danger
from it moving down, so securely wedged was it
between islands and the main shore in a bend of
the river.
The whole thermit work puzzled many promi-
nent engineers all over the country, who had not
been aware of the writer's recent work. Those
who honored the writer by coming to see the work
and study the plans which he had worked out, all
expressed astonishment at what could be accom-
plished, and went away favorably impressed with
the work.
It is not to be expected that those who did not
see the work could feel confident of success, since
nothing like this had ever been attempted before.
The best evidence that the thermit accomplished
the task is given from the enthusiasm of the ther-
mit crews who daily went out in the cold and
wind to place the charges and risked their lives
in the work. Had they not known the effective-
ness of the operations, it is not likely that these
men would have been so willing to do so. No
other incentive actuated them but one for the gen-
eral good of the communities.
NATURE OF THE THERMIT-ICE REACTION
The thermit heat units as developed by the
writer for use in ice accumulations contain ordi-
nary welding thermit manufactured by the Metal
and Thermit Corporation of New York and To-
ronto.
It consists of a mixture of metallic aluminum
and iron oxide in such proportions that the com-
bustion of the aluminum results in the reduction
of the oxide of iron forming metallic iron accord-
ing to the relation:
3 Fe, O4 + 8 Al=4 A12 O3 + 9 Fe
The heat of formation of the Alumina, which is
generated by the reaction, raises the mass to 5000°
Fahr. Heat from a body at such a temperature is
radiated in the form of light and heat waves with
a maximum of energy in the heat spectrum.
Water and ice are partially transparent to these
short rays, as is evident to anyone who observes
the rays of the sun penetrating water. The absorp-
tion is gradual as the rays proceed, and thus the
energy can be distributed over a wide area.
To loosen the ice crystals comprising a mass of
ice, only a very small amount of actual heat is
necessary. The amount absorbed from a beam of
sunlight, or from a charge of thermit is quite suf-
ficient to do this.

THE MICHIGAN T E C H NIC
When heat is applied in the form of steam or
hot water the action is only local, as no rays are
sent out from a body at that temperature which
can pass through water. A small amount of energy
at a high temperature is a much more effective
agent in disintegrating ice than a large quantity
of heat at the temperature of steam.
In addition to this, when heat is shot into ice
at the high temperature of thermit the energy
input causes the ice to rupture and the molten
iron dissociates the ice, forming iron oxide again,
and liberates hydrogen which burns with the oxy-
gen of the air. It is well-known how hydrogen
can be prepared by passing steam over red hot
iron, but at the thermit temperature the dissocia-
tion is more rapid and gives rise to sudden gen-
eration of hydrogen as well as steam. This results
in a slow explosion resembling a heave upwards,
which is ideal in loosening ice masses. Then the
activity of the explosion comes from the ice itself,
which literally causes the ice to blast itself. Dy-
namite can in no way be compared, as the shatter-
ing effect comes from the blow delivered by the
explosive.
One very important feature of the thermit-ice
reaction is that it is not in any way harmful to
concrete structures or earth works. Large charges
have been repeatedly set off alongside of bridge
piers and embankments without any effect on
them.
Large masses of ice have been moved near con-
crete walls with no other effect than the lifting of
the ice several feet in great fields with consequent
large surges spreading out as a number of waves
through the ice.
To fire thermit to the best advantage it is con-
fmed in a water-tight container, with lined walls,
of a size suitable to the work it is designed to do.
The standard unit in this work contained 160
pounds of thermit.
A central fire ignitor is inserted in the top and
operated by a hot-shot battery, blasting machine
or fuse. The reaction takes place in from 5 to 8
seconds, causing the thermit to be converted into
a mass of molten iron which is held long enough
by the thickness of the walls to burn completely to
the bottom. The bottom is made of thinner metal,
through which the molten metal drops by melting
it. It is thus suddenly thrown into the ice or water
with the evolution of the radiant beam, followed
after a few seconds by the explosion which loosens
the ice and burns out the channels under the ice.
Ignition has to begin from the top, as the thermit
will not burn upwards. The result of a thermit
shot in an ice mass is to start a point of weakness
which gradually grows by the infiltration of the
water currents. The action in an immense pack
is like the spreading of infection from a wound.
The effectiveness of thermit was first tried out by
the writer in the ice iams on the St. Lawrence in
the winter of 1924-25. At this time, two large jams
were removed by a few charges judiciously placed
in the key positions. In the one at Washington,
a quarter of a million tons were taken out by
three charges of 90 pounds each, while at Chimney
Island, a few weeks later, over a million tons
were moved down,the river by two charges of the
same size.

ADEQUATE COMPENSATION FOR
ENGINEERS
Of all the learned professions the members of
the engineering profession are most underpaid, and
it is the one profession that today does least for
its members to remedy this evil. This is aptly
illustrated by the recent action of the American
Engineering Council. This organization not only
has gone on record endorsing the Graham bill for
increasing the salaries of Federal Judges, now
before Congress, but is actively supporting the bill.
No one questions the justice or equity of increas-
ing the salaries of Federal Judges. They are under-
paid when compared with the average salary
schedule of the legal profession, nor do we wish
to criticise the American Engineering Council in
this matter; in fact we commend it for its attitude.
But what about the engineers who are underpaid?
Has the American Engineering Council shown the
same solicitude toward their predicament, or has
it advocated any plan or campaign of education
to raise the schedule of salaries of engineers? Is
the average engineer in a more favored position
today than the lawyer? Is it not true that the
average schedule of fees in the legal profession is
far above that in the engineering profession, and
is it not a fact that the average schedule of sala-
ries paid to lawyers and jurists is far above the
average schedule of salaries paid to engineers?
It is argued that the increase of salaries to Fed-
eral Judges has not been in proportion to the in-
crease in the cost of living. Has it been so in the
engineering profession? There are today scores of
engineers underpaid to every lawyer who is under-
paid for his services.
The fact that the legal profession can get engi-
neers not only to endorse their program for salary
increases but also to work actively in their behalf
is evidence that the lawyers are looking after the
welfare of the members of their own profession.
However, charity begins at home and it might be
well for engineers to take a leaf out of the book
of the lawyers and begin to do something for the
members of their own profession who are woefully
underpaid.

Introduction to Contemporary Phyxicx, by K. K.
Darrow (Member of the Technical Staff, Bell
Telephone Laboratories, Ine.) Pp. 453. New
York. I). Van Xostrand Company, $0.00.
From engineers and others interested in the
newer phases of physical science this hook de-
serves an enthusiastic welcome. It meets the very
definite need for reliable information presented in
an attractive and readable form intermediate be-
tween the popular discussion and the highly tech-
nical treatise. The title should perhaps have been
Contemporary Atomic Physics since it deals almost
exclusively with those fascinating researches which
reveal the nature and behavior of atoms and their
relation to radiation. Experimental work is cited
very freely and with admirable discrimination,
clearly revealing the foundations upon which hy-
potheses may be built; the reader is never left in
doubt as to which are the facts of observation and
which the theoretical deductions. The author's ap-
proach to the problems of interpretation might
almost be characterized as that of a skeptic since
no conclusion is admitted without the most rigid
scrutiny, and the beauty of an atomic model is not
allowed to overshadow its inadequacy. Some read-
ers may feel that undue emphasis has been placed
upon those points where present theories have not
been successful, and too little satisfaction in their
triumphs is permitted. However, to many this
point of view will be both refreshing and inform-
ing, and it certainly points the way of progress.
Of the thirteen chapters two deserve special
mention. Chapter VI, Waves and Quanta, ad-
mirably presents the perplexing dilemma of the
nature of radiation, while Chapter IX, Selections
from the Data of Spectroscopy is a very satisfac-
tory introduction to this difficult but indispensable
subject.—E. F. Barker.
Fourth Engineering Booklet l* Finished
Completing years of research and compilation,
the department of engineering research announces
the issuance of the fourth booklet of the 1926 file,
this week. This publication is on "Stainless Steel,"
and is written by Professor A. E. White, head of
the Engineering Research Department, and Claude
L. Clark, holder of the fellowship in metallurgy
established at the University by the Detroit Edi-
son Company.
Under the direction of Professor J. Raleigh Nel-
son, editor of the booklet and chairman o*f the
engineering research publications committee, an
entirely new method of presentation of the subject
was made in the report, as compared to previous
issues. The bulletin is arranged in four parts, and
is intended in this manner, to be of greatest serv-
ice to four distinct classes of readers.
The digest, which sketches briefly the facts re-
garding stainless steel, is intended to be useful to
those who desire a condensed statement of the
whole story, and for the casual reader who is not
particularly interested in the subject.
The second division is devoted to 54 abstracts
of important articles on stainless steel and are re-
corded to permit those who wish, to read evidence
of original authorities on the subject without them-
selves going into an exhaustive search of literature.
The third section contains a bibliography of 132
of the most recognized authoritative books and pa-
pers on the subject, down to the date of publi-
cation. This division was compiled for the benefit
of the research scholar.
The graphical studies published in the fourth
section, are for the purpose of giving the technical
man, accustomed to the interpretation of such ma-
terial, a rapid survey of the subject. This division
contains graphs comparing the significant patents
on stainless steel, with the effect of drawing tem-
peratures as measured by the Brinell hardness
method, the effect of varying quenching temper-
atures, and others.

Oil Supply Will Be Hard to Rtplace
Much of the talk concerning substitutes for oil
contains gross exaggerations. We hear considerable
about the possibilities of getting oil from the pro-
cessing of coal. If we were to process every single
ton of bituminous coal now mined and suitable for
such treatment, the oil so produced would not take
care of the present annual increase in our present
consumption of motor fuel. As for oil from shale,
let us not forget that we would have to mine and
process one thousand tons of shale to drive a mod-
ern warship at full speed for one hour. This means
that if we got into trouble with some other nation,
and were obliged to send a battle fleet across the
Atlantic Ocean, we would have to mine and process
about 1,440,000 tons of shale in order to get the
liquid fuel required for this trip.
In order to substitute shale oil for ground oil
right now in the United States, we would be com-
pelled to mine and process a greater tonnage of
shale rock than the tonnage of coal produced at the
present time in all of our American mines. It has
taken us a hundred years to develop our present
coal-mining industry, and we cannot create a shale-
oil industry in less than 10 or 20 years.—Floyd W.
Patterson, in Industrial Gas Magazine.
o
Coloration of Concrete
The statement that dyes can be satisfactorily used
for coloring concrete has aroused keen interest
throughout the building industry. It is as yet too
early to estimate how far reaching may be the re-
sults of the new process, but already one may feel
fairly confident of its success.
The new process employs those organic dyestuffs
which have the greatest fastness to light, moisture,
and other atmospheric effects, and which in the fin-
ished state are completely insoluble in water. The
color range of such dyestuffs available for use in the
building trade is very extensive, and there seems
to be no reason why concrete should not now be
tinted to produce any reasonable color scheme de-
sired by an architect.
The process is simple,"and is equally applicable
to the coloring of concrete for use in mass or as
blocks. The concrete is gauged, not with water and
the color in powder form, but with a solution of
some simple derivation of the coloring matter. On
exposure to the air or by other simple treatment,
the coloring matter is thrown down in a permanent
insoluble form upon the cement particles. The dyes
most suitable for this work are those that can be
brought into solution in the gauging water by sim-
ple treatment with a small quantity of alkaline salts.
As the gauging is in progress and the concrete is
being turned over, oxidation back to the original
insoluble dyestuff takes place, and by the time the
concrete is applied the whole mass is colored to the
right depth. In some cases the oxidation occurs
with less rapidity, and the concrete may have to be
applied before the original dyestuff is thrown down.
This, however, presents no difficulty, as the oxi-
dation will be complete before it has finally set.
Although the coloring matters used must of ne-
cessity be organic in constitution, this need not in-
volve any fear as to the permanency of the color;
in fact, there are reasons for believing that the or-
ganic colors will be more permanent than the gen-
eral run of pigments. Although it is not possible to
speak definitely until the new building material has
been tried out for several years, it is reasonable to
suppose that a color which is on the cement par-
ticles, instead of between them, will prove less liable
to fade by erosion.
These organic colors also are inert to sulphu-
retted hydrogen, sulphur dioxide, or other compon-
ents of the atmosphere of large towns, which might
have a darkening or other effect upon mineral
colors.
It is hoped that a trial on an extensive commer-
cial scale will be shortly undertaken to show the
advantages of the method both for external and in-
ternal decoration. The outcome will be watched
with great interest.—The Chemical Age.
Mechanical Loading in Coal Mines
A new phase of coal mining recently investigated
by the Carnegie Institute of Technology and the
United States Bureau of Mines is the use of ma-
chines in loading coal in the mines.
Mechanical loading has been tried before without
success. The reasons for its failure, however, have
not been, apparently, in the system used, but in the

handling of the machines by the workmen. The
fact that the use of machines has appeared to be
very easy has led to careless operation and inade-
quate results.
The recent investigation has taken into consider-
ation installations in new mines as well as in old
workings where introduction of machinery is more
difficult. It is evident that some very practicable
mining machinery will be the result of these inves-
tigations.—Department of Commerce.
Heitifttance of Pure Iron to Chemical Corrosion
It has long been known that pure iron is much
more resistant to corrosion than ordinary commer-
cial iron, but the difficulty of producing pure iron
has made any extensive use of it practically im-
possible. However, some experiments in its use
have been made and very satisfactory results ob-
tained.
In a New Jersey plant a feed water heater in
which the corrosive conditions were very severe
due to dissolved oxygen and concentrated salts, was
made from pure iron. It has been installed for ten
years and at the present shows no signs of deterio-
ation and its efficiency has been in no way affected.
An Ohio manufacturer used sifters of pure iron
and although the conditions under which they are
used is very inducive to corrosion they appear to
be little affected. Also, there seems to be little or
no more wear in this case than if other types of
iron are used.
In another Ohio plant pure iron smoke stacks
were used. They have been subjected to very severe
conditions of soft coal smoke and acid fumes for a
period of ten years and are still in very good con-
dition.
These tests indicate that pure iron can be of great
use in prevention of corrosion, especially in pipe
systems in chemical plants. The application of elec-
tricity to the refining of ores has made it possible
to produce it more cheaply than heretofore and it
is likely that its use will increase in the future.—
Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering.
Effect of Sun Kpotx on the Lerel of the
Or cut Lakes
It is well known that the levels of' the Great
Lakes are becoming lower, but few realize that the
frequency of sun spots has a considerable effect on
their position.
A comparison of data has shown that after a year
of increased sun spot activity the lake levels become
higher and when the sun spot activity decreases the
lake levels again recede. This condition is brought
about by the fact that during years of greater sun
spot activity the earth receives about three per cent
more heat than ordinarily, thus producing greater
evaporation from the earth's surface. This increase
in evaporation causes in return a greater precipi-
tatiofi and the lake levels are in consequence raised.
A period of about two years usually intervenes be-
tween a period of increased sun spot activity and
the consequent rise in lake levels. The reason for
this lapse of time is that the increase in precipi-
tation due to a greater sun spot activity does not
follow immediately. Just why this is true is not
well known. It has been suggested that it requires
considerable time for the wind currents of the earth
to change sufficiently to effect the climates and
cause an increase in precipitation such as always
occurs. This suggestion however has been much
disputed.—Water Works.
The Electrification of Gravel Pits
One of the most recent additions to the already
varied uses of electricity in industry is the electri-
fication of gravel pits.
The Greenville Gravel Co. is located at Somerset
Center, near the Chicago turnpike, which is now
being paved and most of the gravel from this pit
goes into that roadbed at the present time.
It was found necessary to get the gravel to the
road gangs more quickly and electricity was called
into use. The monthly consumption of electricity
has risen from 18,000 K.W.H. in June to 41,480
K.W.H. in September.
On this power installation three 50 Kva trans-
formers are used to step the power down from 10,-
000 volts to 440 volts. Transformers are also used
to step the current down to 110 and 220 volts for
lighting use. In this way lighting is included in
the power rate with the energy used by the motors.
Poi-aonouff Petroleum Vapors Studied
The presence of hydrogen sulphide in petroleum
vapors in certain oil fields constitutes a serious
health and safety hazard, states the Bureau of
Mines. Hydrogen sulphide is probably the most
poisonous gas associated with crude oil. Petroleum
vapors are harmful to the human system, but hydro-
gen sulphide, when present, is usually more import-
ant from the standpoint of health and safety.
The concentration of hydrogen sulphide, or the
"sour" gas, in the Texas oil fields ranges from ap-
proximately .20 to .60 per cent by volume. An ex-
ceeding toxic atmosphere can occur in a mixture
of this gas in air. Analyses of a large number of
samples of gas-air mixtures collected on the derrick
floor, and in various other places, show that the
workmen are often exposed for long periods to con-
centration of .01 to .02 per cent hydrogen sulphide
in air.

Two distinct types of symptoms occur in the men
working in the "line" wells of the Panhandle field.
One is irritation of the eyes, the other is uncon-
sciousness attending a very short exposure. One
prominent doctor in the field estimated that he had
treated more than 1,000 cases of conjunctivitis dur-
ing the first six months of 1926. Four deaths are
alleged to have occurred during the past from acute
poisoning.
This poisoning in some cases is due to careless-
ness on the part of the workers. They fail to avoid
the gas and stand on the leeward side of the hole
or in the stream line flow of the gas. A man should
never stand over a gauge hole on a tank. For work
in cellars or places where high concentration of the
gas may occur, men should wear a hose mask
equipped with a blower. Workmen should not en-
ter these places without a safety belt and lifeline.
A general rule is to wear a canister gas mask for
protection only where a man can work for a short
time without respiratory protection. Protective
steps to keep harmful gas from accumulating have
been taken, and good results have been obtained by
the use of a steam jet connected to a casing.—De-
partment of Commerce.

Weldiiif/ Laij/c Metal Struciures
A recent investigation of the strength and dura-
bility of steel structures with welded joints, made
by the American Bureau of Welding, indicates that
welded steel structures may have certain definite
advantages over riveted structures.
Electric arc welding was used in making the
tests. Steel plates were welded together to make
a plate girder. The girder was 15 feet long with
a web plate one-half inch thick and 24 inches deep.
The flanges were 12 inches widev one Ijki, the
other \l/% inches thick. A cover plate 9^ inches
wide and nearly as thick as the plates was used
on the top and bottom flanges. Nine stiffencrs on
each side were welded to both flanges and the
web.
To determine the strength of this structure, par-
ticularly whether the welds were satisfactory, it
was te.sted by the Bureau of Standards in co-
operation with the American Bridge Company.
The Olsen hydraulic machine having a capacity
of 1,000,000 tons was used, loading the girder at
the middle of a 13J/2 foot span.
It was found that the maximum load was some-
what greater than was estimated. The webs con-
necting the web to the top flange failed at the ends
only after the web was buckled and the girder had
deflected several inches.
The investigation will enable the engineer to de-
sign safe welded structures. It is probable that a
saving in the cost of steel structures will result.

Inside Fronted Lamps
The electric incandescent lamp has gone through
many stages to reach its position of the present
time. The most recent development however is
that of inside frosted bulbs.
Due to the brightness of the filament of incan-
descent lamps it has long been customary to frost
the glass bulb which encloses it, thus shielding the
bright filaments from the eye. However, outside
frosted bulbs are objectionable for two reasons.
They are wasteful of light and they collect dust to
a great degree which cannot be wiped off.
For these reasons engineers have long been at-
tempting to produce inside frosted bulbs. How-
ever, all attempts had, until recently, failed, due to
the fact that when frosted on the inside the glass
became so brittle that it would not withstand even
slight pressures. To Marvin Pipkin, of the Gen-
eral Electric Company, is due the credit for finding
the way around this difficulty. His method is
simple.
A strong acid solution is first sprayed into the
bulb which etches it. In this condition the surface
of the glass is made up of irregular projections
with many sharp angles. While the glass is still
in this state it is extremely weak and a slight pres-
sure is sufficient to shatter it. So far, the process
is similar to former attempts at inside frosting.
The difference lies in the strengthening process,
which is the application of another acid solution,
somewhat weaker than the first. This second treat-
ing rounds off the sharp edges and minute projec-
tions, leaving the glass strong again—just as strong
as it was originally.
Superiority of the inside frosted lamp over the
outside frosted, so far as light transmitting char-
acteristics are concerned, also needs explanation.
In the (jutside frosted lamp, light from the fila-
ment travels through the gas or vacuum to the
wall of the bulb, then through the glass, on the
outer surface of which it meets the frost. Then,
depending upon the plane of the particle of rough
surfaces, the beam either passes on through the
frosted surface as useful light or is reflected back
through the glass layer. Each time the light passes
through the glass a certain amount of absorption
takes place.
Diffusion of the light by inside frost is obtained
by prismatic reflection with comparatively little
loss. In fact the inside frost allows an even greater
portion of the light to pass through than does a
similar frost on the outside of the lamp. It is
found to be only about two per cent less efficient
than a clear lam]).
Another great benefit of the discovery of inside
frosting comes from the fact that manufacturers
will need only one type of lamp of each wattage
instead of lamps of several different finishes.—

of a new machine designed for the evaporation of
beet sugar juices.
The machine, according to Professor Badger, has
the advantages of having a higher capacity than
the old type, and also will boil the sugar juices
without changing the color as formerly was done.
Mr. Diaz, for two years, was an instructor of
chemical engineering at the University of Porto

his work in the South.
On December 15, Dr. Gustav Egloff, Technical
Director of the Universal Oil Products Co. of Chi-
cago, gave an interesting lecture to the student
branch of the American Institute of Chemical En-

subject of cracking of oils by the Dubbs crocking
process. Dr. Egloff declared that all rumors of a
petroleum shortage were without foundat&lt;on and
gave a complete exposition of how the problem
will be averted. His article in this issue contains
much of his treatment of the subject.

Honor
In order to better acquaint the freshman class
with the honor system and its details as they are
in effect in the College of Engmeering and Archi-
tecture several hundred copies of a handbook ex-
plaining the system have been printed and will be
distributed to the freshmen in the near future.
Besides the rules and regulations of the system,
there are printed in the booklet several articles re-
garding the viewpoint of the Engineering Faculty,
a bit of advice from Dean Mortimer E. Cooley,
a history of the system as it was conceived :md in-
augurated, and a pledge whi&lt; h the student may
sign, offering his support of the system.
"Perhaps the greatest good of the honor system
is in the increased self-respect by the student," is
the opinion of Dean Cooley. "A student working
under this system meets you in a different way—
as man to man. He seeks no favors and asks for

their jackets again, lending color to the classrooms
of the Engineering School. The class of '28 has
departed somewhat from the precedent set for sev-
eral years before and have selected blazer coats.
The coats have alternate blue and grey stripes and
over the left breast is a 2E8 monogram in black
letters. The blazers are very attractive and the
class should be congratulated for their selection.
Professor W. L. Badger, of the Chemical Engi-
neering Department, has been commissioned by
the Federal Phosphorous Company of Birmingham,
Ala., to devise a method whereby the caking of
tri-sodium phosphorous in packages will be pre-
vented. This substance is the basic chen.ical for
j.ll washing powders, and has caused considerable
trouble to manufacturers by its tendency to cake.
Considerable notice in this field has been gained
by Professor Badger due to his research work in
connection with the prevention of caking in table
salt.
COVER DESIGN
Mr. John Watrous Case, Architect, whose water
color of Santa Maria della Salute on the Grande
Canal at Venice appears on the cover of this issue,
studied civil engineering at the University of Mich-
igan and was a graduate in architecture at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1888. He
won the Rotch Traveling Scholarship from the
State of Massachusetts in 1892 and subsequently
traveled and studied two years in Europe, sending
back some very distinguished studies in architec-
ture, the cover page of which is one. After com-
pleting his travels in the Rotch Traveling Scholar-
ship, he organized and taught the course in
drawing at the Detroit Central High School from
1901 to 1905 along with his practice in architec-
ture. He was appointed professor of Architectural
Design at the University of Illinois in 1905, which
position he held until 1910.
Some of his works in architecture have been
published in the various magazines, some of which
are "Hints to Traveling Art Students," in the
American Architect of February 16, 1923, and
March, 1905, and Design at University of Illinois,
September, 1908. He also published an article on
"The Crematorium" in the Brick Builder of Oc-
tober, 1902, and "Architectural Education" in the
Brick Builder in 1901. A series of articles were
published on the Design at the University of Illi-
nois in the Architectural Annual in 1909. His
Rotch Scholarship competition drawings were pub-
lished in the Architectural Review in 1892, Vol. 1,
No. 5. Also some of his works were published in
the New York Architectural Club Catalogue in
1895, Philadelphia Architectural Club Magazine in
1896, Chicago Architectural Club Magazine in 1906
and Detroit Architectural Club Magazine in 1900.
His Envoys from the Rotch Scholarship were pub-
lished in the Brick Builder in 1902, and the Archi-
tectural Annual in 1908.
Some of the awards in competition besides the
Rotch Scholarship were the House Beautiful, No-
vember, 1908; Detroit Journal Building. 1907, and
the first prize in Beautiful Homes in 1909.
Mr. Case has continued his practice of Archi-
tecture since leaving the University of Illinois in
Detroit and is now practicing in the Capitol The-
atre Building, Detroit, Mich., with Mr. Austin A.
Howe as associate.

COMPENSATION FOR ENGINEERS
(Continued from page 35.)
The American Association of Engineers has in
the past taken up the battle of adequate compen-
sation for the railroad engineers and for the mu-
nicipal engineers of seven of our larger cities and
has helped them secure substantial increases. The
Association stands today defmitely committed to
a policv of adequate compensation for engineers
of all branches of the profession. It is the only
engineering organization that has so far taken a
definite stand in this direction. Much can be ac-
complished by proper publicity, educating the pub-
lic, and by co-operation among engineers. It is
hoped that engineers the country over will give
their active support to this work of A. A. E. in
trying to better the financial status of engineers
who are today underpaid.

Echoes from the Graduates
ALEX Dow
ALEX DOW, President of the Detroit Edison
Company, and Detroit's "most valuable, and
most useful citizen." It is with the greatest
pleasure that we present here the life history of
Mr. Alex Dow. There is very little need for stat-
ing just who he is or what he has done to deserve
the esteem of the people of Michigan. His pro-
found knowledge of all branches
of engineering, of literature, of
science and of men and of their
money make him seem almost
immortal unless you have had
the rare privilege of meeting
him in a friendly interview.
There is not the slightest doubt,
in the minds of the men who are
acquainted with the engineering
problems of the city of Detroit,
that the executive genius and
practical engineering knowledge
of Mr. Dow has been a god-send
to that city. But Mr. Dow has
not confined himself entirely to
Detroit; the University of Mich-
igan is indebted to him for the
many helping hands he has
given it during the past thirty
years. Electrical apparatus, me-
chanical laboratory apparatus,
endowments, scholarships, and
the maintenance of the Edison
Company's equipment at the University, to the very
peak efficiency for facilitation of research and study
carried on here. It is not possible to say too much
in praise of the good work he has accomplished, but
these accomplishments are not the products of a
sudden inspiration, nor of accidental character.
Back of all this "crowning glory" of success is a
l.mg hard road that tells of a life of study and toil.
Mr. Alex Dow was born in Glasgow, Scotland,
in 1862. For many years his forefathers had been
the skilled swordmakers and blacksmiths, having
their ancestry in a Highland sept, the Stewarts of
Appin. Mr. Dow's father was also a blacksmith, ap-
ALEX DOW
prenticed and trained, but in later years he took up
the profession of accountancy in Glasgow City.
Here Alex Dow was born and attended the public
schools of his day until he was about 11 years of
age. At the end of the school term he went to work
as a messenger and by promotion became a junior
clerk and later a stenographer. He took care of
himself from the time that he
was 14 years old and on the
death of his mother left Scot-
land entirely. He went to work
for the Cunard Steamship Com-
pany in Liverpool, where he was
employed in the passenger de-
partment. He continued in the
employ of the Cunard Steam-
ship Company until 1882, when
he came to the United States.
From the time that he was 16
years old he was a member of
the Lanark Engineer Volun-
teers, a military engineering mi-
litia. Although he preferred
colonial service, he could not
realize his desire because of his
youth.
Mr. Dow was naturalized in
Baltimore in 1895, where he re-
sided during the first years of
his life in America. From 1882
to 1883 he was employed as a
cierk for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and from
1883 to 1888 he was with the B. &amp; O. Telegraph
Company, in charge of city wires, with line and
instrument maintenance and some telephone and
electric light construction. Prior to his coming to
America Mr. Dow had had little schooling in any
branch of engineering and made the most of his
military training, and while he was employed by
tl/e telegraph company he studied a great deal the
material then at hand on telegraph and telephone
theory. When his work gave him opportunities
to study electric lighting he at once saw there a
greater field than telegraphy and so changed the


Page 43
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
particular subject of his education, lie worked as
lineman, wireman, and dynamo and switchboard at-
tendant, for various employers in Philadelphia and
Baltimore during the year 1888. He then became
connected with the Brush Electric Company of
Cleveland, Ohio, at first at its Chicago office as
installing electrician. In 1889 he became district
engineer and had responsible charge of important
engineering work such as the design and construc-
tion of the park and boulevard lighting system for
Washington Park, and Drexel and Grand Boule-
vards in Chicago, Illinois. The work was of an un-
usual character as it required some thirty miles of
underground cable, to be operated at 3,000 volts.
From July, 1893 to 1896 he was chief engineer of
the public lighting commission of the city of De-
troit, where he designed and constructed the public
lighting plant of that city.
In July, 1896, Mr. Dow became manager and en-
gineer in charge with the title of vice-president and
general manager of the Edison Illuminating Com-
pany of Detroit, which in 1902 was succeeded by
the present company, the Detroit Edison Company,
which serves with power and light some 4,000
square miles of area and nineteen cities, including
Detroit.
Throughout his life Mr. Dow has been a student.
His knowledge is so practical and so thorough that
problems from all branches of engineering and
(ither subjects are constantly being brought to him
for solution. He has made a circle of friends and
admirers in this country that would alone proclaim
his life a success even if it were not for the great
commercial institutions that he has built up. The
great power plants in and around Detroit stand as
monuments to the success of his work. Just re-
cently the Detroit Engineering Society gave a din-
ner in honor of Mr. Dow, which was attended by
famous engineers from all parts of the country.
There is not room here to repeat all the fine tributes
that they paid to him, but in the reminiscences they
presented of times when they had worked or been
associated with Mr. Dow they gave nothing but
true praise for his untiring and conscientious work
in the field of pioneer power development.
Certainly there is no finer example of what may
be accomplished by valiant and conscientious ef-
fort. Mr. Dow did not have a position handed to
him on a "gold platter"; every inch of the way
to the top of the ladder of fame and fortune he
has had to fight. The sky was not always rosy. It
is true that he had the advantages of a wonderful
personality and a gift of executive ability and an
understanding of human knowledge that may not
be given to us all. But there is a great lesson to
be learned from his life: honest endeavor may
not be an express elevator to the pinnacle of suc-
cess, hut it is as sure as the "mills of the gods."
As students of the University of Michigan, we
owe a great deal to Mr. Dow, for the many things
that he has done for this school of ours, the many
generous gifts that he has made, especially in the
days when the engineering college was young and
struggling, that have helped to build it up to its
present state.
Mr. Dow has been awarded two honorary de-
grees from the University, he was awarded the
degree of Master of Engineering in 1911, when
the University "adopted" him into the fold as one
of her sons. Then later as his work extended into
even greater fields, the University recognized this
greater service and conferred upon him the degree
of Doctor of Engineering in 1924. There can be
no more said than that this, the highest honor that
can be conferred in engineering can hardly do jus-
tice to his great work.

SELF-A NA L YSIS
By DEAN MORTIMER E. COOLEY
WHAT thought shall I give you, young gen-
tlemen, on the morning of your entrance
into these halls; when you are to fit your-
selves in the world of strife
and gain—and loss? That last
word does not fit well with
your present mood, for within
your horizon today there is
room only for the things
which gladden the heart—the
hopes and ambitions which
brought you to college.
It is a fair land which
awaits you when viewed from
the hill-top, but between you
and the goal you seek lie all
of the obstacles which have
been discovered by those who
have preceded you as explor-
ers in the field of life's work.
Not only those obstacles, but
others, which can become
known to you only as indi-
viduals. It is to those other
obstacles, the obstructions
which you will find lying in
your own particular path, that
I would direct these words. The goal awaiting tin-
man who can overcome obstacles, particularly
those peculiar to himself, is success. The key
which unlocks the door and brings the magic word
within the scope of your vision is self-analysis.
"Know thyself," spake Solon, one of the seven
wise men of Greece 600 years before Christ. These
words are inscribed over the entrance of Apollo's
temple at Delphi. Let them also be inscribed over
DEAN MORTIMER E. COOLEY
the entrance of the temple of your mind,—burned
in with fire that may never be effaced. The man
that truly knows himself has a profound knowl-
edge of man. Pope said: "The
study of mankind is man."
Remember always that while
the world is ever new, the
foundation truths are always
old. Beneath the surface of

The Michigan Technic takes this opportunity to con-
gratulate Dean Mortimer E. Cooley on the occasion of
his seventy-second anniversary, March 28, 1927. This
article is the substance of an address made by Dean

it to the end, it will come finally to an examination
of yourself. It may be that what we call "luck"
for want of a better word, has had something to
do with it. We almost always seek some excuse
for our failures, blame someone or assign some
cause that gives us comfort, all the time fighting
shy of the real cause. There is the point I want
to impress upon you. Look not about you but
within for the cause, and be mighty sure you do a
good job of looking.
Let me illustrate. Many years ago there was a
student here who had a growl in his voice. He
gave the impression of always carrying a chip on
his shoulder. His classmates did not fraternize
with him. Over the drawing board with him on
some problem, it occurred to me that he was un-
conscious of his fault, so one day I asked him if
he knew he had a growl in his voice. He was as-
tonished—had never thought of it, and almost im-
mediately his face lighted up with a look of under-
standing and he thanked me sincerely for calling
his attention to it. Today he is the sales manager
in one of our largest cities for one of the most
celebrated manufacturing concerns in this country.
This position he has held many years—far out-
stripping some of his classmates who gave brighter
promise while in college. Not the least important,
he is happily married, has a family of children
nearly ready for college, has given immeasurable
pleasure to his parents, who were simple farming
people here in Michigan, to whom he introduced
me on his graduation day, and never fails to call
on me, or on members of my family, with his wife
and children, whenever he is within reaching dis-
tance. Young gentlemen, that distinguished son of
Michigan made good use of the binocular, self-
analysis, once his attention was called to it. It ic-
vealed to him the golden key which unlocked the
door, not only to success in a pecuniary sense, but
what is vastly more important,—to success as a
citizen of influence in the community in which he
lives, and as the respected and loved head of his
splendid family.
Possibly it may not be clear to some of you just
what I mean by self-analysis. It is the exami-
nation which enables one to see in himself the
things so readily apparent in another. To the man
honest with himself it is a splendid discipline. It
creates in one a modesty which notwithstanding
the tendency of the times, may still be considered
a virtue. It engenders a spirit of sympathy. It
fosters .those qualities which attract us and which
make us say of him that he is gentle and well-bred,
and possesses a charming personality. If you,
young gentlemen, could only know how often we
who have been charged with your training are
asked to pass upon your merits by your prospec-
tive employers, and how often the question of your
personality is inquired into, I am sure you would
more fully appreciate that these virtues summed
up in good breeding have a distinct commercial
value, and play no small part in one's success in
life. Self-analysis will disclose to you all these
things and many more. It will be Aladdin's blanket
to carry you safely, even swiftly, over seas of dis-
content, anxiety and unrest.
I must not let this opportunity pass without a
word on the proper relation of you as beginners in
the world's work to the man who after graduation
gives you employment and makes you a member
of his business staff. It is all-important for you to
remember that you are beginners. The men higher
up in authority have most of them traveled the
same road you are starting on; many of them, in-
deed, began far lower down and had to surmount
obstacles which you will escape. But remember
that the race is not always to the swift. The longer
road does not necessarily mean a longer time to
reach your goal. The training, the discipline ac-
quired in the early stages of the journey, will give
the power to travel more swiftly the latter stages
of the journey. Be content, therefore, if your first
employment but affords you the means to live in a
simple way, provided there is a real goal ahead.
Fortunate indeed is the young man who finds his
first employment at a low salary, a bare living
wage, with prospects ahead; and unfortunate he
who starts at a much higher rate with no pros-
pects. It is a sad day when the expected promo-
tion does not materialize for the reason that the
pay is already too high. Happiness and success are
measured by the derivative which determines the
direction of the tangent to your curve. Keep this
tangent always in the ascent and be content to
start at a low enough point to insure that it will

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
THE LONGEST RAILWAY TUNNEL IN AMERICA
By RAY Y. WRIGHT
THE Great Northern is constructing a single
track tunnel 7.78 miles long through the
Cascade range between Berne and Scenic,
Wash., which, when completed, will be the long-
, est railway tunnel in America. The new line, of
which it is a part, will lower the summit elevation
505 feet, will save 7.67 miles of distance and elimi-
nate 6.04 miles of snow sheds, and 1941 degrees of
central angle, besides reducing the maximum cur-
vature from 10 degrees
to 6 degrees. Within
the limits of the work
the maximum gradient
eastbound is reduced
from 2.2 per cent to
1.565 per cent. As a
part of the project the
present electrification
through the existing
tunnel will be extended
t o Wenatchee on the
east and to Skykomish
on the west, a total dis-
tance of 80 miles, and,
later 23 miles further
west to G o 1 d b a r, 29
miles east of Everett.
Fro m a n economic
standpoint the construc-
tion of the tunnel can
be fully justified by the
elimination of the snow
sheds on the old line
with their high mainte-
nance cost and constant fire risk. The snowfall in
the Cascades is very heavy and at the point where
the railroad crosses the mountains, amounts to 56
feet annually, which packs down to about 16 feet
on the level. As a result of this extraordinary
volume of snow, combined with the steep slopes
of the mountains, snow slides are frequent and
troublesome. Occasionally, they destroy sections
of the snow sheds and interrupt traffic until the
track can be cleared of the snow and debris. In
addition to the elimination of the snow sheds, the
railroad will receive the benefits of the decreased
rise and fall, the shorter distance, the better align-
ment and the improved traction resulting from the
electrification of the mountain territory, and these
taken together are in themselves sufficient to jus-
tify the project.
The outstanding feature of the construction is
the rapid progress that has been made to date, as

the world's record for advancing has been broken
in four consecutive months, in three of which the
advance was greater than in preceding month. As
a result, on November 27 the contractor was ahead
of schedule by the amounts shown later. In August
the pioneer tunnel at Scenic, 8 feet by 9 feet in
section, was carried forward 937 feet; in September
the 10-foot by 10-foot center heading at Berne was
driven 954 feet, but counting October 1, as all rec-
ords of tunnel advances
are based on 31 days,
this was increased to 984
feet; and in October, a
still higher record of
1,157 feet was made in
the pioneer heading at
Scenic. In November an
advance of 952 feet was
made in the pioneer tun-
nel at Scenic and 938
feet in the center head-
ing at Berne, and while
lower than the Septem-
ber and October records
in this tunnel both are
greater than any known
record on other tunnel
work. On December 1,
the total primary pene-
tration was 17,257 feet
or 42J/2 per cent of the
total length of the tun-
nel.
Recently the Great
Northern has been rearranging its engine dis-
tricts and gradually increasing the distance
between engine terminals. As a result of this
policy, the rearrangement between Spokane and
Everett eliminated one district, so that freight
trains now run from Spokane to Wenatchee,
174 miles, and from Wenatchee to Everett,
132 miles. The electrification, which is a part
of the tunnel project, will extend over the heaviest
of the mountain grades, and the later extension to
Goldbar will cover practically the entire mountain
territory through the Cascade range. When elec-
trified service begins, it is expected there will be
a material reduction in the time required to move
trains between Skykomish and Wenatchee.
At present, the existing line passes through a
tunnel 2.63 miles long and it is electrified to reduce
the trouble experienced from locomotive gases.

heavy pusher service is required. The speed is
slow and much time is lost in switching the push-
ers in and out of trains, while stops must also be
made at Tye and Cascade, the portals of the exist-
ing tunnel, to attach and cut off the electric loco-
motives which pull -the trains through the tunnel.
Under electric operation over the extended mile-
age, which will cover all of the heavv mountain
tunnel is put in operation, the existing tunnel 2.63
miles long, between Cascade and Tye and all of
the old line between Scenic and Berne about two
miles below Cascade, a total distance of 17.67
miles, will be abandoned.
It was stated at the beginning of this article
that the new Cascade tunnel will be the longest
one in America; it will also be the fifth longest in
the world.

the movement of freight through the mountains
will consume less time. Again, with the improved
traction the number of trains will be less; pperat-
ing costs should be reduced materially: and a sub-
stantial amount of power and car equipment will
be released for other service. A detailed descrip-
tion of the electrification and the electric locomo-
tives appeared in the Railway Age of Novem-
ber 27.
The Old Line
Westbound from Wenatchee, the line ascends
the valley of the Wenatchee river and from Leav-
enworth to Chiwaukum it lies in Tumwater can-
yon, entering Nason Creek canyon at the latter
point which canyon it followed to its upper end at
Cascade, the east portal of the tunnel. The line
emerges from the tunnel at Tye and enters the
can von of the Tye river which it follows to Sky-
komish, 21 miles. Between Tye and Scenic, 9
miles, the line descends 1,O45 feet, and about two-
thirds of the distance is through snow sheds. At
Martins Creek, the line passes through a tunnel,
both portals of which face east. When the new
How the Work Is Organized
Between Scenic and Mill Creek a pioneer tun-
nel, 8 feet by 9 feet in section, is being driven
parallel to and 66 feet south of the main tunnel,
with cross cuts at intervals of about 1,500 feet.
From these cross cuts a center heading. 10 feet by
10 feet, is advanced on the line of the main tun-
nel, and this is being followed by enlargement to
full tunnel section from the west portal and from
the foot of the Mill Creek shaft.
Mill creek flows through a deep and well de-
fined canyon about 2.4 miles west of Berne, and
here a point was selected to sink a shaft 659 feet
deep, so that additional faces can be worked both
east and west from the foot of the shaft. From
Mill Creek a pioneer tunnel is being driven west,
with cross cuts at intervals of 1,500 feet, to meet


Page 9

the pioneer advancing from the west portal, while
a full tunnel section is also being driven west from
the shaft. A center heading is being driven east
from the foot of the shaft, for since the center
headings between Mill Creek and Berne can be
holed through in a comparatively short time, there
is no advantage in driving a pioneer tunnel be-
tween these points. When the center headings
from Berne and Mill Creek meet, enlargement will
take place from the east portal.
It was desired to begin work on the center head-
ing at Berne before a steam shovel was available
to make the approach cut, and, as the topography
was favorable, an adit was drifted in from the
north until it met the line of the main tunnel
about 200 feet west of the portal, and from this
point a center heading was started. After the ap-
proach cut was completed a top heading was drift-
ed on the line of the main tunnel and the bench
removed as far as the junction with the adit, but
10 further work will be done towards the enlarge-
ment at this end until the center heading from
Berne meets the center heading which is being
advanced east from Mill Creek.
At the Scenic end, the first 800 feet was driven
through soft material, consisting of clay in which
large boulders were embedded and gravel streaks.
This material was very wet, although the amount
of water draining into the tunnel is comparatively
small. At one point the bores crossed a seam of
clay and gravel about 140 feet wide, which had
the consistency of sloppy concrete, and gave con-
siderable trouble both at the face and in the plac-
ing of the timbers. Because the general character
of the ground was known, it was deemed advisable
to start the center heading in the rock west of the
first cross cut, and the top center heading method
was followed from the portal to this cross cut.
The section was then enlarged to a full top head-
ing and behind this the bench was removed to
give the full 18 feet by 26 feet tunnel section.
At the west end the tunnel emerges into the
valley of the Tye river, which follows a tortuous
course at this point and falls sharply in a series of
cascades, so that, while the stream is below the
track level at the portal, it crosses the tunnel
about 60 feet overhead at a point 2,000 feet farther
east. About 225 feet east of the portal, a creek
tributary to the Tye crosses 14 feet over the main
tunnel and to avoid danger from flooding, a
wooden flume was constructed to carry the water
over both the main and pioneer tunnels.
Under the present channel of the Tye river, a
large crack was encountered which gave every evi-
dence of being the result of an ancient slip. The
rock seams were displaced both vertically and hori-
zontally and the gap was filled with debris, con-
sisting of clay, boulders, and logs, such as might
be expected in a slide. Presumably the Tye river
changed its course when the slip occurred, as the
clay pocket already mentioned appears to be in
the ancient bed of a stream, because it contained
boulders, tree trunks, and other drift.
The amount of timbering and other safety pre-
cautions necessary while passing through the soft
ground made it certain that progress would be
very slow until the headings reached solid rock.
For this reason, an incline was drifted down from
a point immediately east of the Tye river to the
line of the pioneer tunnel, which was advanced
from the foot of the incline 3,387 feet, while an
advance of 2,316 feet was made from the portal.
By this means the entire pioneer tunnel progressed
5,703 feet by the time the soft ground was passed,
and four working faces for the center heading of
the main tunnel were available through cross cuts.
The center headings at Scenic were started at
the first and second cross cuts, and as soon as the
heading between the first and second cross cuts
was drifted through, a top heading was started
east from the first cross cut. It had been intended,
if possible, to enlarge the section from cross cut
No. 1 by the ring method, but the coarse granite
encountered in this section is highly impregnated
with lime, which slacks after a few days' exposure
to the air and the rock spalls badly, so that the
ring method was not considered safe. The top

heading permits the roof to be timbered before the
benches are removed, so the men can work with
safety. East of cross cut No. 2, the rock structure
so far encountered will permit ring shooting, al-
though there are occasional narrow seams where
timbering will be necessary.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Character of Rock
The first rock encountered was a coarse granite
which is very hard, but, as mentioned, is impreg-
nated with lime and slacks upon exposure. It was
difficult to drill and broke quite large, so that
mucking operations were slow. After passing cross
cut No. 2 the rock is an altered granite showing a
much finer grain with occasional streaks of schis-
tose structure, and, except for an occasional pocket
containing mica, it drills easily and breaks in a
satisfactory manner. At intervals, water under
pressure has been encountered in the pioneer tun-
nel at Scenic and this, while small in quantity, has
hampered blasting, so that several times it has
been necessary to drill relief holes before the main
holes could be charged for blasting. At one place
the pressure was so great that the water jetted six
feet from the holes. Peculiarly enough, however,
the quantity of water has been comparatively
small, and water under pressure does not occur in
the center heading of the main tunnel, apparently,
because the pioneer tunnel, which is in advance,
affords the necessary relief to the pressure.
At the Berne end the first rock encountered was
a coarse granite, similar to that at Scenic, which
was hard to drill and broke large enough to ham-
per mucking. Timbering was required here also
because of the tendency to slack. About 1,000 feet
from the portal a finer granite, similar to that be-
vond the second cross cut at Scenic, was encoun-
tinued west to permit the pioneer to advance more
rapidly and make additional faces available, but
the center heading is continued east from the en-
larged disposal station.
Disposal pockets were constructed below grade
and gates installed for the purpose of loading the
hoisting buckets. The muck is loaded in cars of
50 cubic feet capacity at the face of the center
heading to the cast, and in 6-yard cars at the face
of the enlargement to the west. It is then hauled
to the foot of the shaft by electric locomotives and
dumped into the pockets. These pockets discharge
into hoisting buckets to be lifted to the surface,
where the material is emptied into storage bins
from which it runs into the cars to be taken to the
dump.
To permit an early start in sinking the Mill
Creek shaft and avoid the delay which would have
resulted from the construction of a permanent
head frame, a small temporary head frame was
erected so that the sinking operation could be car-
ried on while the permanent head frame was under
construction. This was built in two sections, the
pockets being built in the position they were to
occupy, and the head frame proper about 15 feet
back of its final position to clear the temporary
structure. When finished, the head frame was
lubricated on its skids by forcing hard grease over
the skids and onto the sills through pipes to which
compressed air under 100 pound pressure was ap-

tered, and only a small amount of timbering has
been required in this formation. This rock is very
dry and water has given no trouble at the Berne
end.
The foot of the Mill Creek shaft penetrated a
large block of graphite, and the graphite was quite
widely dispersed in the rock surrounding the main
deposit, so that solid timbering was necessary in
the enlarged chamber at the foot of the shaft. The
full tunnel section, 18 feet by 26 feet, was taken
out for a distance of 100 feet, in both directions
from the shaft to give working room for the dis-
posal of the muck, and the full section will be con-
plied. The head frame was then skidded forward
by means of five 15-ton jacks, placed in exact po-
sition, and the shaft timbering was prepared with
guides to match the guides fitted in the head
frame. The time required to remove the tempo-
rary structure and place the permanent head frame
was nine hours. The head frame is 80 feet high
and is substantially built of heavy timbers. Each
of the five long braces at the rear is a single tim-
ber in the form of a truncated square pyramid, 84
feet long, and having end dimensions of 14 inches

THE DETROIT RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEM
By J. R. HENDHY, '06E*
ON April 4th of this year will be submitted to

"Do you approve and favor adopting an
ordinance entitled: 'An ordinance to empower the
Rapid Transit Commission to construct and ac-
prehensive rapid transit layout for not only De-

would be a poor system indeed that made no pro-

make the accomplishment of the "Master Plan"
and the building of Rapid Transit possible. Along
these lines the legislature has passed:

The Darin and the Atwood bills facilitating
and setting up the machinery for acquiring the
wide thoroughfares.
The Callender Act, an amendment to the Home
Rule Act permitting the financing and construc-
tion of a Rapid Transit System.
In addition to the above, Detroit and surround-
ing towns have found it necessary to amend their
charters, pass ordinances and hold referendum
votes in process of advancing the "Master Plan"
and paving the way for the actual construction of
Rapid Transit.
One of the most important things thus far ac-
complished by the Rapid Transit Commission is
the plan of financing the construction of the sys-
tem. Heretofore the commonly accepted method
of financing such a project has been by a bond
issue. The Detroit Rapid Transit Commission has
adopted a pay-as-you-go method, doing away with
the huge interest carrying charge a bond issue
involves. In a subway system such as Detroit
proposes, the permanent way consisting of the
tubes and stations would cost approximately 68
per cent of the entire cost, and the equipment,
consisting of power, yards, shops, cars, signals
and track, 32 per cent.
Under the plan proposed by the Rapid Transit
Commission, one quarter of the cost of the per-
manent way, or 17 per cent of the total cost, will
be raised by an ad valorem assessment on the city
at large. In the case of the two-line system now
being considered, namely the Grand Rivcr-Gratiot
line and the Woodward line, this ad valorem tax
would amount to 70 cents per $1,000 on the basis
of the 1926 assessed valuation. This is a yearly
tax and would run for ten years. As the as-
sessed value of the city increased, the rate would
lower, as the amount to be raised is a fixed sum.
Three-quarters of the cost of the permanent
way, or 51 per cent of the total cost, will be
raised by direct assessment on locally benefited
property — locally benefited property being de-
fined as all real estate lying within a half-mile
of the Rapid Transit line. This assessment varies
from 5 cents per square foot immediately adjacent
to a station, to one-half cent per square foot a
half-mile away. Intermediate assessments vary
on a straight line ratio between these limits.
Exhaustive investigations in other towns, par-
ticularly in Brooklyn, show that these proximity
assessments are directly proportional to the en-
hancement in value of the land, due to Rapid Tran-
sit, and will average from one-fourth to one-seventh
of the enhancement. It was at first thought that

A NOTE ON WATER COLOR
By JEAN PAUL SLUSSER
Instructor in Drawing and Painting
UNQUESTIONABLY, there has been a real
revival of the art of water color in recent
years. From being a diversion for
dilettantes and a polite accomplishment for young
ladies, water color, which over a century ago in
the hands of Girtin, Cox, Cotman and Turner, was
one of the chief glories of the English school of
landscape, has come into its own again as a serious
and independent medium worthy of the deepest
attentions of nature artists. In this country, es-
pecially, there has ap-
peared in recent years
a surprising number of
good water colorists.
and various of the
modern group of
painters have experi-
mented with the me-
dium with great suc-
cess. John Marin, one
of the first of living
American artists, ex-
presses himself in this
medium solely, and
two of the most im-
portant of recent
American painters,
Winslow Homer and
John Singer Sargent, were superlative water
colorists, and even, according to some critics,
touched their highest levels in this art.
It is possible that water color, which is a quick,
brilliant and flexible medium, is essentially suited
to the nervous American temperament. American
water color, as it has developed recently, is as
different from the more deliberate British product
as baseball is from cricket, or as New York sun-
shine is from London fog.
Possibly some of the present interest in water
color in this country is due to the influence of
the two great American masters in this medium,
Homer and Sargent. The two are as different as
possible in point of view and method.
Homer was the more native and of the soil, the
more rugged and the more personal. Sargent was
the more cosmopolitan and urbane, and tech-
nically the more brilliant. Sargent's water colors
can scarcely be excelled for sheer brilliance in
their command of the medium, but those of Homer
have more to say and hold us longer. Maurice
Prendergast and Mary Rogers, recently deceased,
SOUTH FERRY
did valuable work in water color, and of the liv-
ing American water color painters, Dodge Mac-
Knight and John Marin are probably the most
important. They represent the high points re-
spectively of Impressionism and Post-impression-
ism in this field. MacKnight in his way is preemi-
nent, but it is a way which now seems much
less important than it once did. Marin gives far
beyond the mere representation of effects of light
and the accidents of external reality. He pene-
trates deeply into the
subject before him, re-
duces it to its plastic
elements, analyzes
them and recombines
them into a new whole
whose logic is its own
and yet whose total
effect is profoundly
suggestive of his orig-
inal impression. It is
a tremendously se-
lective art, like that of
the old Chinese land-
scape painters, like
theirs mvstical and like
them, he achieves his
effect partly by insist-
ing upon the beauty and expressiveness of the in-
dividual brush stroke.
Water color is a subject about which it seems
futile to make rules. Turner, one of the greatest
of water-colorists, knew all the rules, and painted
as if there were none. It is a medium in which,
far more than in oil, the artist may follow his
idiosyncrasy and invent a technique to suit his
personality. This is a part of the fascination it
has for both the artist and for the public.
The books on water-color are mostly by Eng-
lishmen and hence recipes, descriptions of processes
and injunctions to do thus and so. The best
course for the would-be water-colorist is to take
his brush in hand and strike for himself. Em-
phatically, however, it should be said, water-color
is not a beginner's medium. Because of its cheap-
ness and general convenience, it is used widely in
schools and introductory classes, but it is too
tricky, too artificial, and too arbitrary to be an
ideal medium for the beginner.
There is. undoubtedly, truth in the common be-
lief that certain kinds of things make good water-

THE AMERICAN INSURANCE UNION CITADEL
By C. HOWARD CRANE
The Cover Design on This Issue is a Reproduction of
the Architect's Sketch of the Entrance to the Building.
THE new American Insurance Union Citadel
which is now nearing completion in Colum-
bus, Ohio, is, up to the present writing, the
fifth tallest building in the world. From the curb
line to the top of the urn, which serves as an or-
namentation for the stack, it is exactly 555 feet.
Syi inches. A building of this height presents
many structural and engineering problems, any of
which will suffice for a complete article in itself.
This article will merely in a brief manner set forth
a few of the interesting facts connected with the
planning, designing, and building of this structure.
This building contains a large and complete
theater, seating 3,100 people, a 600-room hotel, and
an office building containing 75,000 feet of rentable
area. Anyone would think that a building of such
diversified uses would require a complicated plan:,
on the contrary, the simplest plan worked out to
be the best. The property on which the building is
located is a full block, abqut 190 feet square. By
making the plan of the main structure L-shapSd,
and placing the office building entrance in the
tower on the corner, one can readily see how the
court remaining in the back could easily be used
as a,theater. The main portion of the building for
the full height of the wings is used for hotel pur-
poses, and the tower portion from the twentieth
floor up reserved for office space. The elevators
serving this office space run up through the hotel
portion in blank shafts.
After this plan was decided upon, a more or
less simple design suggested itself, and the big
problem was to design a building that would
neither be a hotel, office building, or theater in
appearance. The present design might be called
strictly American. Its vertical line treatment sug-
gests somewhat the Gothic, yet there is nothing
of the Gothic in its detail. Form—or proper sil-
houe,tte was the main objective, simple lines, cor-
rect scale, and a restrained handling of the detail
was necessary.
The material used in the exterior is terra cotta.
Stone was first suggested for the reason that the
ordinary terra cotta blocks could not be made
larger than about 18x24 inches without warping,
and blocks of this scale in a building of this size
would be out of the question. In order to over-
come this difficulty, many experiments were made,
using different surface textures for the terra cotta,
and finally, after much effort, the terra cotta engi-
neers and the architects decided to use a rough
texture surface, that would be uniform in its un-
evenness, and so designed to disguise any warping
that might occur in the making of larger blocks.
The result has been that the blocks used in this
building are nearly three feet square, and are in

proper scale with the structure. This uncvenness
of texture has proved an asset, rather than a lia-
bility in the appearance of the building. At first

BEET-SUGAR REFINING
Hv DONAL HAMILTON HAINES
STRETCHING across the North American
continent from coast to coast there is an
invisible belt in which soil and climate are
peculiarly suited to the growing of sugar beets.
The southern limit is the point at which the autumn
comes so late that the beet does not begin the
storing of sugar for the feeding of the roots dur-
ing the winter; the northern limit lies at the point
where the growing
season is too short.
The fact that Michi-
gan lies well inside
these limits explains
the prominent part
which the state has
taken in the beet-
sugar industry since
its early days in the
United States.
The figures for the
total sugar consump-
tion in the United
States for 1926 show
that of the 5,671,335
tons consumed, 871,-
815 tons were domes-
tic beet - sugar. The
largest single contri-
bution was 3,291,297
tons of Cuban cane,
Louisiana and the island possessions contributing
1.465,844 tons of cane sugar.
According to the statistics gathered for 1924,
Michigan's rank among the states in the produc-
tion of beet-sugar is as follows, the figures repre-
senting thousands of tons:

During the black days of 1917-18, it was brought
home to many Americans that there might be a
close connection between war and sugar, yet few
people know that the real father of the beet-
sugar industry was that man of war, Napoleon.
Beet-sugar had been manufactured in Europe be-
fore Bonaparte's day, the presence of sugar in the
beet having been discovered by Marggraf in 1747
and the first factory in Europe established by
Achard in 1799 and run with moderate success,
but it remained for Napoleon—whose mind dealt
with war-time economics as facilely as with the
principles of strategy
—to put the industry
on a solid basis. The
British blockade cut
France off from the
supply of cane sugar•
raised in British pos-
sessions— then sup-
plying practically all
that was used, and
Napoleon promptly
placed on beet-sugar
a bounty so high that
a considerable num-
ber of manufacturers
were attracted to the
business, which was
thus given an impetus
in northern France
which has never been
lost.
From France the
manufacture of beet-sugar spread to other countries
—Germany, Belgium, Italy, different states of the
Austrian Empire, and some of the Scandinavian
countries, and at the present time the process has
been brought to its most efficient state in Czecho-
slovakia.
The varying standards by which efficiency in
the process is measured furnish an interesting com-
mentary on economic conditions in Europe and
in the United States. A good mill will burn from
12 to 15 pounds of coal per 100 pounds of beets.
In the Czecho-Slovakian mills the efficiency of
the process has been brought to such a point that
the coal burned amounts to only 5 pounds per 100
pounds of beets, a figure far more economical than
that reached by any American mill. Fuel-econ-
omy, however, is the natural goal of the Euro-
pean manufacturer, owing to the expensiveness
of coal, while this is not such a high considera-
tion with the American sugar manufacturer. In
this country, labor is the chief item of expense,


March, 1927
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
and in this regard the American industry has gone
considerably beyond any of its foreign compet-
itors. In a Colorado plant of the Great Western
Sugar Company, for instance, every 100 pounds of
sugar manufactured represents one-half a man-
hour of labor, while the best figure reached by
any European mill is the production of a 100-
pound sack of sugar through three man-hours of
labor.

LIQUOR IS TAKEN DOWN TO A CONSISTENCY NEARLY
THAT AT WHICH DECOMPOSITION WOULD TAKE PLACE
AT THE BOILING POINT UNDER ATMOSPHERIC PRES-
SURE. NEXT, THE SYRUP PASSES TO THE
VACUUM PANS
As early as the "80s, the manufacture of beet-
sugar was begun in the United States, but, al-
though there was a steady increase in the num-
ber of mills in operation, the real rise has come
largely since 1910. In the early period—previous
to this latter date—the American industry did not
stand on its own feet. Practically all the mills
in this country at that time were equipped with
machinery manufactured in Europe and staffed by
experts brought to this country from France or
Germany.
An interesting off-shoot of this early period
has been the growth of two distinct "jargons" of
the trade, for in those districts where the first
mills were run by French experts, the terminology
is natural French, while a list of German terms
for the different stages of the manufacturing pro-
cess has rooted itself in those parts of the coun-
try where the pioneer sugar-makers were from the
other side of the Rhine.
Today the American industry has grown en-
tirely out of its European leading-strings. Prac-
tically all mills are equipped with American-made
machinery, and it is no longer necessary to send
to France or Germany for a first rate mill-superin-
tendent or for "boilers," as the men in charge of
the most critical operation in the process are called.
A race of American sugar makers has grown up
to replace their instructors from overseas.
As indicated in the opening paragraph, the manu-
facture of beet-sugar in Michigan differs from
the other industries of the state already discussed
in these articles—paper-making and furniture-mak-
ing—in that its development has been the result
of the natural resources of the state rather than
a combination of chance and the business acumen
of certain individuals. Beet-sugar must be manu-
factured close to those sections of the country
in which the beets can be raised easily and with
profit to the growers and Michigan, as stated, lies
inside the limits of the territory in which tiie
sugar-beets flourish.
The sugar-beet is normally a biennial plant,
growing during the first season and bearing its
seed during the second. It stores sugar as food
for the winter, beginning the process in the fall.
For this reason, the sort of autumn weather which
pleases the average person is by no means wel-
come to the farmer who has devoted part of his
acreage to sugar-beets, for warm fall weather
with a good deal of rain induces further growth on
the part of the beets, which means that the supply
of sugar already stored as food for the winter will
be all or in part exhausted, and that the time left
for storing more sugar, after growth has finally
ceased for the season, will be so short that the
sugar-content of the beets will be far too low for
commercial use.
Beet raising is not a simple matter of planting
a crop and then waiting for the time it is ready
to harvest. Beets must be thinned by hand,
weeded by hand and by no means all of the labor
of harvesting can be performed by machinery. Add
to these facts those that the Michigan farmer had
to be educated in the idea of beet growing on a
large scale, that the question of hauling the beets
had to be given careful consideration, and finally
that, under the most favorable circumstances, a
beet-sugar mill can count on an active campaign
of only from 90 to 100 days out of every year, and
it will be evident that the men who founded
the business in Michigan had to preface the actual
manufacture by a long campaign of propaganda
and education, and that, at the outset at least,
there was a decided element of daring in the
venture.
The actual process of extracting sugar from
beets is very far indeed from being the simple
and rather crude undertaking which one is tempted
to imagine it. After one has seen a bale of straw
flung in one end of a large brick building and a
pasteboard box emerge from the other, and has
witnessed the transformation and seen that it
takes place almost wholly through the operation
of ingenious machinery and without interference


Page 17
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
by human hands, the problem of extracting from
a beet the certain percentage of sugar which it
is known to contain does not promise a perform-
ance either complicated or hazardous, and one
is surprised by the number of critical stages
through which the raw material must pass from
the moment the beets are brought to the mill, the
extent to which the process must be controlled
and the technical skill necessary for the success-
ful exercise of that control.
This doesn't mean that the making of beet-sugar
is any more highly developed or scientific than
the other processes which the writer has tried
to describe, but that in the case of sugar the work
of the laboratory is never finished until the trans-
formation from raw material to finished product
has been completed; the scientist—or at least the
scientifically trained workman—has to maintain his
vigilance all the way instead of leaving much of
the process to machinery which requires little or
no watching.
The sugar-beet is a root made up of cells, with
a stiff wall, a layer of protoplasm and in the
center a clear liquid which contains the sugar in
solution. The mechanical problem is to get the
sugar out, but to extract it without getting out
all the other soluble substances. In the early
days, the method followed was to grind the beets
so fine that all the cells were crushed. This re-
duced the beets to a mush and the juice extracted
was of a very impure sort, so that the refining
process was far more difficult and could _never
be made as thorough. The designers of machinery
directed their efforts toward producing a device
The beets—after being subjected to several
operations to be described later—are dumped into
large cylindrical containers. At the bottoms of
these cylinders are the knives, which cut hori-
zontally, turning in a circle as they are driven

which would cut up the beets and yet burst as few
of the cells as possible in doing so. The result
was the modern form of knife which operates in

by a shaft, the beets being brought down to the
cutting-table by gravity-feed. The knives, which
are razor-sharp, are so shaped that they cut the
beets into "V" shaped slices ("cossettcs" in the
jargon of*those mills which cling to the French
terminology of the trade) about three inches in
length, a quarter of an inch wide across the open
end of the "V," and perhaps an eighth in thick-
ness. It has been found that this method of slic-
ing the beets ruptures the smallest number of
cells, and leaves the raw material in the best
possible form for the next stage in the process.
Moreover, as the texture of the beets varies dur-
ing the course of the campaign (due to differences
in conditions under which they were grown, etc.),
it is possible to vary the thickness of the slices by
readjusting the knives in the slicers.
But, while the "slicers" perform the first step
in the mechanical process, the beet does not go
under the knife directly from the farmer's wagon
in which it has been carried to the mill. It is
first dumped into a Hume and the surface dirt
taken off in the washers and then carried to the
scales before it is ready for the knives.
The weighing of the beets is no mere formality.
nor a simple check on the amount delivered, but
a part of the system of laboratory exactness
which is employed throughout the entire process.
To the superintendent of a beet-sugar mill, the
word "efficiency" is no mere term. His job is
to get out of every ton of beets the maximum
amount of sugar which can be taken from them;
and he knows in advance what this maximum is,

CHOOSING A BRANCH OF ENGINEERING
By BENJ. F. BAILEY, Ph.D.
Professor of Electrical Engineering
IT IS of course self-evident that the young man
about to choose his life work is facing one of
the most important decisions of his entire ca-
rper. I am assuming that my readers have gone
so far as to make a decision in favor of engineer-
ing and that they are now confronted with the
necessity of deciding which particular branch of
engineering they are to specialize in. Later it will
be necessary to make other choices such as which
particular function of engi-
neering shall be chosen and •
perhaps to make a choice of
employers.
Presumably the young men
to whom this is addressed
have shown an inclination to-
ward engineering. This inclin-
ation is usually shown in one
of the following ways:
(1) By a liking for physics
and mathematics.
(2) By curiosity as to why
machinery operates.
(3) By a desire to make
things.
(4) By an interest in the
business side of engi-
neering.
It will be seen from the
above that men of quite different types may be
attracted to the engineering profession. Many men
have gone very far as engineers who had little or
no interest in mathematics, for example, but who
have had a tremendous curiosity as to just how
and why a gas engine operates. Other men whose
interest was mainly in the commercial side have
become executives in engineering work although
most of these also were interested in why electric
motors or steam engines operated, or perhaps, as
boys, loved to build pieces of machinery.
The profession of engineering is much broader
than was formerly the case. It is perhaps possible
to divide the functions of an engineer into four
classes:
(a) Research.
(b) Engineering design.
(c) Manufacturing.
(&lt;1) Commercial work.
Each of these functions may be exercised in Civil,
Mechanical, Electrical, Chemical, Naval or Mining
Engineering or, in any of the numerous subdivi-
EACH year the members of
one class must turn the
course of their study definitely
toward a certain branch of en-
gineering. In many cases, the
student has little knowledge of
the work in any specific field,
His choice is practically a hit-or-
miss chance. It is our desire in
this and succeeding articles to aid
the student engineer to make a
logical and well-thought-out deci-
sion.—The Editor.
sions of the above. If we were to try to classify a
large group of engineers we should need approxi-
mately one hundred different pigeon holes in
which to place them. Thus one man might be de-
scribed as a research engineer in internal com-
bustion engines and another as a sales engineer for
electric motors and a third as a bridge designer.
It will be seen that engineering may be divided
both horizontally as well as vertically; horizon-
tally into functions, vertically
into the well known classes of
civil, electrical, etc. Of the
two the horizontal division is
the more fundamental,
The amount of money being
spent for research is continu-
ally increasing and t h e r e is
every prospcct that this in-
crease will continue. One well
known electrical organization
spends about $8.000,000 a year
on research work and others
spend approximately as much.
Most of the work is of course
applied research, that is, re-
search upon problems of
pressing importance to the in-
dustry, but a surprisingly
large amount is pure research,
that is, research not apparently leading to any im-
mediate commercial result. To succeed well in
research work a man should certainly be strong in
physics and mathematics and he should certainly
have a curiosity and interest in why things op-
erate.
The young man starting his engineering edu-
cation usually thinks in terms of designing engi-
neering. In earlier days this was the principal
form of engineering recognized. The qualifications
for a good designing engineer are very much the
same as those of a research engineer. It is perhaps
not so essential that he should be markedly strong
in physics and mathematics, but on the other hand
he should have shown more of a desire to make
things with his own hands.
The field of manufacturing is one that is being
invaded more and more by the technically trained
engineer. Formerly, almost all of those in charge
of manufacturing had risen through the ranks of
ordinary workmen, foremen, superintendents. To-
day the higher positions in the direction of manu-


Page 19
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
facturing are being filled more and more by men
of primarily technical training with, however, some
workshop experience. The man who would suc-
ceed best in this line of work is one whose in-
terests have been largely in making things with
his own hands and who has also shown executive
ability in directing the work of others.
The commercial field is also one being largely
taken over by the technically trained engineer.
Not so very many years ago a technical training
for a salesman was considered by many as a lia-
bility rather than as an asset. Today the old type
of salesman is rapidly disappearing and is being
supplanted by a type of man
who in addition to good per-
sonality and sales ability has a
thorough fundamental knowl-
edge of the apparatus he is try-
ing to sell. It is not too much
to say that in many cases to-
day the salesman is to a large
extent a consulting engineer. If
a young man has a reasonably
thorough knowledge of the fun-
damentals of engineering cou-
pled with a pleasing personality
he may well consider salesman-
ship as a life work.
The higher executives in the
manufacturing field are also be-
ing chosen more and more from
technical men. It is still not
unusual to find a man of legal
'training at the head of a big
manufacturing concern, but the
indications are that in the fu-
ture men with technical train-
ing plus some knowledge of
business law will largely occupy these positions.
A man with an electrical engineering training
may readily function in any one of the four
branches mentioned. His own abilities point out
which one he is best fitted for, in fact his abilities
and inclinations point more definitely to one of
these functions than they do to one of the branches
of engineering. Moreover it is easier to change in
after life from one branch to another than it is
to change one's function. For example, it is not at
all unusual for a well trained electrical engineer to
change from research in electrical engineering to
research in mechanical engineering. The funda-
mentals of the two are absolutely the same and
most of the mathematical work is absolutely inter-
changeable. An electrical engineer who knows a
good deal about the oscillations of an electric cir-
cuit as applied in radio necessarily understands a
great deal about the oscillations of an automobile
PROF. BENJ. F. BAILEY
on its springs and a man who understands the
forces involved in an alternating current circuit
understands the forces exerted on the piston of a
reciprocating steam engine. A change say from
electrical to mechanical in research work would be
much easier than a change from electrical research
to electrical sales. In fact this latter change would
be many times almost unthinkable.
I have tried to convey in the above the fact that
the most important decision that a young man
makes is the particular function which he is to
serve in engineering rather than the particular
branch he should go into. However as our courses
a r e organized it is necessary
that he select one of the well
known branches and some ad-
vice along this line may be ap-
propriate.
It is undoubtedly true that to
make good grades in the course
i n electrical engineering the
young man should be well
grounded in mathematics and
physics. Contrary to the ordi-
nary belief electrical phenome-
na are much simpler than me-
chanical phenomena, t li a t is
they obey simpler laws. For
example, the relation between
the force required and the cur-
rent in an electric circuit is a
very simple one being a direct
proportion whereas the law
connecting the velocity of a
freight train and the force re-
quired is a very complicated
one. This very simplicity of the
electrical laws tempts us to car-
ry the mathematical analysis much further than is
profital.le in any other field. This is the reason for
saying that to succeed well in his work, at least as
far as making his grades in college is concerned, a
student should be reasonably strong in mathe-
matics and physics.
Some deficiency in this respect may however be
amplv compensated for if the young man has a
real interest in electrical machinery and a desire
to know why things "go." I have seen many stu-
dents make brilliant successes whose abilities were
along this line rather than in mathematics.
The other qualifications that have been men-
tioned are of importance to an electrical engineer
and a strong inclination along any one of these
lines may make up for lack of mathematical abil-
ity. 1 can recall many cases of students whose
grades in college were mediocre, who in after life
made brilliant successes in sales work or in manu-

Upon the outbreak of an emergency our Na-
tion's man-power crowd the recruiting stations and
overnight we have an army of many thousands of
men. They at once look to Ordnance for the tools
of their new profession. Our Nation has been en-
joying an era of peace and our thoughts of war
have been so far removed that the Ordnance De-
partment has scarcely had sufficient personnel to
draw the pictures of their product.

through the Reserve Officers' Training Corps at
the University of Michigan.
On April 1, 1917, fifteen Ordnance officers sat
at desks in four rooms of the War Department.
Outside of Washington were eighty-two other
Ordnance officers. This corps of ninety-seven offi-
cers running eleven small government arsenals be-
came an organization of 5,800 officers directing the
work in 5,000 main plants whose objective was a
rate of production adequate for an army of 5,000,-
000 men and involving an expenditure in two and
one-half years of thirteen billions of dollars and
for Ordnance there is no corresponding industry
in the peace organization.

War brings with it an increased consumption
which ranges from foodstuffs and clothing to au-
tomobiles and locomotives. The man away from
his family must be fed as well as furnished with
Ordnance. He wears out four pairs of shoes to
one in civil life. He is blanketed and clothed in
wool, whereas at home he might have worn other
material. When we follow all the materials con
sumed by an army from their original raw state
to the finished product and realize that they must
all be produced by the folk left at home, in ad-
dition to their own needs, we realize the tremen-
dous load that war puts on industry and the vital
dependence of militarv strategy on industrial ef-
fort. War is not economical and this presents a
picture of the economic problem which confronts
a nation at war. Its consumption is greatly in-
creased but its man-power of production is de-
creased. To equalize these two vital differences is
one of the problems of Industrial Mobilization.
Supplying a modern army is a civilian, an in-
dustrial problem, affecting the entire populace. So

National Defense—is well recognized by industrial
engineers. The high economic value of such plan-
ning is translated by them into terms of substan-
tial factors of safety, which guard against waste
and failure in guaranteeing a short successful war.
Planning for industrial preparedness has been
made a function of the Assistant Secretary of War
and for efficiency in dealing with industry the
country has been divided into fourteen procure-
ment districts, based upon lines of industrial ac-

tivity. This plans for the decentralization of pro-
curement, production and inspection of material by
organizing in each district an agency to deal di-
rectly with the manufacturers. The Ordnance de-
partment maintains in each district an office di-
rected by a Regular Army officer whose duty is
to develop plans for securing from manufacturing
plants in his district such war munitions as may
be allocated to that district by the Chief of Ord-
nance.
A procurement plan for national defense must
be based upon a corresponding military plan. A
basic mobilization plan for a maximum effort has
been prepared which shows the number of men
to be mobilized, the rate at which they will be
called to the colors, and the organizations to be
formed; also a table of allowances which shows
the types and numbers of every article of equip-
ment necessary for the various organizations.
From this basic mobilization plan details for the
mobilization of industry must be developed assur-
ing adequate plans for the necessary supply of
munitions.
To show how requirements are computed from
the basic mobilization plan, let us consider the re-
quirements for a field gun of a given type. To
determine them we must extract from the basic
mobilization plan the number of organizations
equipped with this type of gun, together with their
rate of formation and their allowances. This gives
the rate at which initial equipment must be fur-
nished. Experience has taught us how fast these
guns wear out and a replacement factor must be
added. An allowance for schools and the stock of
the Ordnance mobile repair shops, which accom-
pany the front line troops for the purpose of im-
mediate repair or replacement, are added to obtain
a final requirement rate, from which must be sub-

tracted the reserve stock on hand to give us our
final required production rate. It has taken fifty
officers nine months to figure the requirements of
the War Department for all branches of the serv-
ice under the present mobilization plan. It will
take about five years to complete our procurement
plans. Branches like the Ordnance Department
and Air Service make demands on industry for
which no facilities exist and it will require an in-
dustrial survey of a vast number of factories and
facilities before they can accurately estimate war-
time production. In making such surveys we have
traced the shell back into its raw materials, into
the nitrates, the iron, manganese, copper, nickel,
tin, and other raw materials which must be gradu-
ally worked into the brass shell case, the propel-
ling charge, the bursting charge, the shell itself,
and the fuze. When we realize that there is no
machinery on hand for this sort of work, when
each round will require 253 different gauges for
inspection to insure its fit and perfect functioning
in any one of the many guns, that the manufac-
ture of the lathes and other machine tools are lim-
ited in number and that there are no workmen on
hand in quantity who have experience in this type
of work, you will realize why it takes time to
produce these items. If we have a plan, each fac-
tory can start converting to its war production the
day war is declared. If we have no plan we are
delayed by indecision and unwillingness to under-
take the task because they have not had time to
consider the advantages and disadvantages.
This survey of industrial facilities has been made
by the officer in charge of the district procurement
office. To eliminate conflicts between the various
supply branches of the army and between the
army and navy, the Assistant Secretary of War
has allocated to each supply branch the industrial
facility with which it may deal. These allocations
are made on the recommendation of the supply
branches, considering the type of material which
the particular factory is most able to produce. To
date ten thousand facilities have been allocated to
the various army supply branches and sixteen hun-
dred have been allocated to the Ordnance De-
partment. The following is an extract taken from
the tables of allocation:

In time of peace, the procurement activities of
each district are controlled, under instructions
from the Ordnance office, by a district chief as-
sisted by a Regular Army Officer of the Ordnance
Department. All district chiefs are civilians and
are men of industrial prominence and wide ac-,
quaintance within their districts. These district
chiefs have in turn selected other prominent and
able men to advise them. Through these men the
Ordnance Department gains and maintains con-
tact with industry. All of them give their time to
this work on a purely volunteer basis and with-;
out financial compensation.
The district chief, his Regular Army assistant
and the necessary clerical force constitute the
peace time organization of a procurement district.
The necessary expansion to carry the burden
placed upon the office by the basic mobilization,
plan has been carefully worked out and the reserve
personnel necessary to complete the organization
has been assigned to specific positions. This re-
serve personnel is being selected and by assigningi
persons who are especially qualified for a position,
and by additional training in the duties of that
position, an organization will be able to function_
efficiently with a minimum of delay.
The Chief of Ordnance apportions definite re-
quirements to each district and the district office,
must locate the sources of production. The execu-'
tive assistant, accompanied frequently by the chiefs
themselves, visit many firms allocated to Ordnance
in their district to establish personal contact, ex-
plain the problem to the management, get an idea
of their facilities, and find out what each can best
produce. Then when a "war order" is given a
district the district chief selects a manufacturer
who is asked to agree to accept the task, consist-
ing of a production schedule showing the item, the
quantity, and the rates of delivery required. At
the same time they are furnished with drawings,
specifications and all available manufacturing in-
formation.
Practically all Ordnance being non-commercial
the factory finds it necessary to formulate plans
for the production of such material. This phase of
industrial planning is termed "factory plans" and
are usually made at some expense to the accepting
firm. These plans include such data as plan lay-
out, route sheets, bills of material, requirements in
machine tools, manufacturing gauges, raw mate-
rials, labor and power. In short, they are com-
plete plans for altering existing facilities and
adopting them to the production of Ordnance. The
value of such factory plans cannot be over esti-
mated. Time is vital to our success, and we need
only visualize what these plans will avoid in un-
certainty and delay to appreciate their worth in
terms of early production in quantity.

NINE HUNDRED SLAVES APIECE
By E. E. FREE, Ph.D.
THERE is now rising in New York City a
vast building which will house the terminus
of a pipe line. This pipe will not bring
water. Instead there will pour out of it each hour,
for the service of the city, the labor of ten million
slaves. These slaves will be electric ones; the
building is the new East River Power House of
the New York Edison Company, rated at a mil-
lion horsepower which is more than ten million
man-power. The powerful streams of electrons
which will pour out over its wires are as truly
the slaves of the citizens as were the regiments of
Nubian captives who served Pharaoh.
The metaphor of a pipe line is apt, for through
great power houses, in each American city flows
to its citizens a part of their daily portion of the
benefits of science. Too many people think of the
results of scientific research as being facts buried
in books, unreadable except to experts. These
books are only containers. The real results of sci-
ence are the benefits it gives mankind.
Ninety-six years ago in London a simple, retir-
ing man named Michael Faraday was preaching on
Sundays in the chapel of the austere sect to which
he belonged and spending the other six days put-
ting together bits of wire and steel and what-not
in the basement of the Royal Institution. He dis-
covered a fact called electromagnetic induction,
which means that one magnetized bit of iron or
one wire carrying an electric current can influence
another a short distance away. These facts were
not then known to be of any use. Electricity was
expensive and scarce. All the electricity that Fara-
day or his contemporaries had to work with was
made from batteries like those we once used for
doorbells or from frictional electric machines pro-
ducing sparks like the sparks you can draw from
the fur of a cat in cold weather.
Working at the same time were Ampere in
France, Joseph Henry in America and a host of
others. Results of these men's labor pour out now
through the pipe lines that begin at our power
houses. Only by virtue of researches on electro-
magnetism which Faraday and others completed
in those long ago days can we now convert the
energy of coal into the power of electricity and
send out this electricity over wires to light our
houses, to run our street cars and to perform each
year an increasing percentage of the daily tasks
that irk us.
Inside the great dynamos of the new power-
house in New York, as of all similar power houses
in other cities, are a multitude of small coils of
wire and of small magnets. Either the coils or the
magnets move as the dynamo rotates; sometimes
both do. As they pass each other pulses of electric
current are set up in the wire. That is exactly
what Faraday was working with. He was moving
magnets past coils of wire and discovering that
electric currents were thus produced. We have
only made larger and more efficient machines for
doing this, so that we not only have vastly more
electricity at our service than any man of Fara-
day's time could have, but we have it at enor-
mously less cost.
During the past nine decades many scientific
men have helped this development. Each has
poured his best into the pipe line. Mankind enjoys
the result. Scientific research is filling a vast reser-
voir of needed knowledge. Workers in our uni-
versities and industrial laboratories, add what facts
they can. Future generations will enjoy the fruits
of what we do now as we are enjoying, at the
wire-filled mouths of our power houses, the fruits
of what Faraday began ninety-six years ago.
The extent to which electricity has remade the
world is seldom appreciated. We used last year in
the United States more than one hundred billion
man-power of electricity. Man-power is more im-
pressive than horse-power. If we tried to get ,these
same tasks done by actual human labor, as even
the greatest kings of Egypt or of Babylon would
have had to do, each man. woman and child would
have to own, keep and house about nine hundred
slaves: slaves to light the lamps, to draw the
chariots, to run with messages and to sweep the
floors and to carry us up on their backs to the
tops of whatever tall buildings we dared to build.
Another feature of the modern power house is
almost equally impressive, the perfection of its au-
tomatic control. In the new East River Station a
glass-protected gallery, high up on one wall of the
vast-thousand-foot hall that houses the nine tur-
bines and their dynamos, looks down on all the
acres of machinery where tiny men here and there
are testing or oiling or looking to the bearings or
the valves. Here sit men who hola the nerves of
the power house. No mere man starts any dynamo
or turns any valve. The electric slaves do that for
themselves. Tiny switches and buttons in the con-
trol gallery, high up behind its noise-excluding
glass, tell the dynamos and turbines and boilers
what to do. Tiny lights on a switchboard which
fills one whole side of the room in front of the*
operators announces that whatever was ordered
has been done.

not change direction indicating a fixed peak in

I would have you remember another thing which
you will recognize from your study of mechanics.
The exertion of a great force is made possible only
by a great resistance to be overcome. It is the
same thing when applied to man and his career in
life. With no resistances to be overcome, there is
no call for great force. On the other hand, the
more difficult the task, the greater is the strength
required to accomplish it. Seek, therefore, not the
easy road to success if you would achieve renown
in your profession. Note on Commencement Day
the men who receive honorary degrees, and the
simple sentence pronounced by the President
which forms the basis on which the degree rests.
Each one of those so honored has had some magic
word, motto, or star, which has kept his eyes ever
upward in his journey since the day when like
yourselves he entered college and dreamed of the
days ahead.
"What would we do in this world of ours,
Were it not for the dreams ahead?
For those thorns are mixed with the blooming
flowers,
No matter which path we tread.
"And each of us has his golden goal,
Stretching far into the years;
And ever he climbs with a hopeful soul.
With alternate smiles and tears.
"That dream ahead is what holds him up
Through the storms of a ceaseless fight;
When his lips are pressed to the wormwood's cup
And clouds shut out the light,"
And now the final word, young men. It may not
spell success when measured by the commercial
scale. But it will stand large on the books kept by
God and your fellow men when the day arrives for
the weighing. I would have you more than all
else be honest and fearless, and ever looking within
to see whether the acts of your life are meeting
with the approving smile of that little god, who
like the sign boards by the wayside, keeps one ever
on the right road. Be real men wherever you find
your place in life and remember always that
"It takes a man to stand alone,
A man whose heart is strong,
To do what he believes is right
And single-handed make his fight
When thousands call him wrong.
"It takes a man to turn aside
The popular applause,
To stand against the moving tide
Of multitudes when they deride
And not forsake his cause.
"It takes a man content to be
Unpopular, uncheered,
To battle conscientiously
For right his fellows may not see
When hatred's head is reared.
"Great deeds are seldom born of praise
With smiles right is not won:
Unpopular are oft the ways
Of him who seeks the truth to raise
Until his work is done."
THE CASCADE TUNNEL
(Continued from page 10)
vertical members range from 12 inches by 12
inches to 16 inches by 16 inches.
The method of driving the full tunnel section
in both directions from the foot of the shaft was
to advance a top heading and follow this with the
removal of the bench. Before there was room to
operate a mucking machine and the model 20 Ma-
rion shovel, a small Hoe scraper with a tugger
hoist was used to slush the muck into the pockets.
As soon as there was sufficient room for the shaft
disposal station, the center heading was started
east and is progressing rapidly. West of the shaft
the full tunnel section is being advanced by means
of a top heading and removal of the bench. About
October 20, work was started on the pioneer tun-
nel and this will be carried forward as rapidly as
possible. The pioneer tunnel will advance more
rapidly than the main tunnel, so that a center
head can be started at the second cross cut west
of the shaft and the enlargement in that direction
carried on continuously.
Tunnel Is Comparatively Dry
As has been mentioned, water has given com-
paratively little trouble to date. The maximum
amounts which have been encountered are as fol-
lows:
Gallons
per min.
Scenic pioneer 125
Scenic incline 215
Scenic main tunnel 10
Mill Creek shaft 185
Berne center heading 2
Between June 1 and November 1, the quantity
of water at Mill Creek decreased from the maxi-
mum to 95 gallons per minute, most of which
comes from strata near the surface and not from
the tunnel itself, as there is practically no seepage
in the tunnel at this point. Except for the few


March, 1927
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
instances mentioned, where water under pressure
was encountered, the working face is dry and
seepage does not begin for some time after the
rounds are fired. At the west end the water drains
by gravity, but as the Tye river incline was situ-
ated at a point where the cover was 97 feet, the
water in the incline heading, before the pioneer
tunnel was holed through, was drained by gravity
to a sump at the foot of the incline and discharged
by electrically operated Cameron pumps.
Air and Electric Power Are Used
All of the mechanical operations in the tunnel
are carried on by electric power, except the drill-
ing and the operation of the shovels engaged in
enlarging to full tunnel section which are done by
air. The permanent trolley for the electric loco-
motives ends about 800 feet from the working face
to-prevent its being torn down by the force of the
blasts from the shots. As the locomotive must
work near the face, it is equipped with a special
hook to fit over the trolley near the end, and the
power is transmitted through a heavily insulated
and very flexible wire which winds off a reel on
the engine. As the wire winds off it puts tension
in a spring and when the locomotive returns the
spring automatically winds the wire on the reel.
The power for the mucker and hoist is brought up
also by extension wires to avoid damage to the
permanent lines from the blast.
The drilling is done by means of air machines
and water core drills. The drilling machines are
mounted on the cross bars of a Denver Rock Drill
Company's movable carriage which runs between
the haulage tracks. As soon as the mucking op-
eration is completed, the mucking machine is with-
drawn, the track is laid to the face of the heading,
and the drill carriage is shoved into place. Four
or six drills are used simultaneously, depending on
the size of the working face. Where the rock
breaks easily, 10 and 12 foot rounds are pulled,
but where the rock is seamy or inclined to break
large, shallower holes or a larger number are
drilled. The time required to drill a round varies
with the character of the rock, and in some in-
stances has required as much as six hours.
The track centers of the haulage tracks are such
that the distance between the inside rails is equal
to the gauge of the tracks, so that the mucking
machine and drill carriage run on what is to all
intents and purposes a middle track and, therefore,
are centered where brought up to the face of the
heading.
By reference to the illustration it will be noted
that the rear end of the drill carriage is equipped
with manifolds to distribute the water and air to
the several drilling machines so that only single
lines of air and water need be connected when the
carriage is placed for drilling. When it is spotted,
it is anchored in place by means of a spud which
depends from the forward end almost directly
under the cross bar frame.
The mucking operations are carried on mechan-
ically by means of Meyers-Whaley muckers in the
headings, and steam shovels at the enlargement.
Where the rock breaks in good shape, a 10 to 12
foot round can be mucked out in about two and
one-half hours, while where the rock breaks large
more time is required. Cars of 50 cubic feet capac-
ity are used to transport the muck, and 12 of these
cars are hauled at one time by General Electric
tunnel locomotives. Only one car can be placed
back of the mucking machine at a time and to
avoid the delay of making a switch every time a
car is loaded, a double track is laid to the face of
the heading and the empties are set on one track,
while the locomotive which is to dispose of the
loads works on the other. A transfer hoist at the
rear of the empty train lifts the cars over to the
loading truck and the locomotive merely shoves
them back to the discharge of the mucker. This
system reduces the time of mucking by about one-
third and mucking is often completed by the time
the drillers have finished scaling.
At the west end where the enlargement has
progressed beyond the first cross cut the material
is being loaded on six-yard cars by a model 40
Marion shovel mounted on a caterpillar tractor.
and the cars are handled to the dumping trestle
by 20-ton General Electric locomotives. At Mill
Creek a model 20 Marion shovel is being used in
the full tunnel section west of the shaft. Electric
locomotives and six-yard cars are in service at this
face also.
A typical cycle of the heading operation at the
Tye river incline, when the heading had been
drifted 3,054 feet from the foot of the incline, is
interesting:
Blast 7:10 a. m.
Time required for ventilation 27 min.
Time to enter drift, and clean up fly rock with mucking
machine, and hand mucking 38 min.
Main muck pile 1 hr. 22 min.
Remove mucker and set drill carriage 38 min.
Drilling 28 holes 8 ft. 6 in 1 hr. 17 min.
Loading and retiring 18 min.
Blast 11:50 a. m.
Total time of one complete cycle 4 hr. 40 min.
Used 195 Ib. 60 per cent gelatin.
Advanced 7 ft. 6 in.
Cross section 9 ft. by 10 ft.
Four drills on Denver Rock drill carriage.
Character of rock—altered granite.
Number of men, 16—including shifter and foreman of underground
labor gang. •
Twenty-eight SO cu. ft. Koppel cars loaded and dumped on waste pile
at head of incline.
Bonus Paid for Rapid Progress
The high rate of progress has been mentioned.
So far as known, the greatest monthly advance
heretofore recorded was in the west pioneer of the
Connaught tunnel at Rogers Pass on the Canadian


Page 27
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Pacific in January, 1915. While this advance was
932 feet, it was made on a face 8 feet by 6l/2 feet,
or 52 square feet, whereas the high record of 1,157
feet at the Cascade tunnel was made on a head-
ing 8 feet by 9 feet, having an area of 72 square
feet, so the amount of rock broken and removed
was 38.5 per cent greater per running foot.
The heading operation is paid for on a footage
basis with a bonus for progress in excess of a
stipulated number of feet. Crews working directly
in the heading are paid at different rates per foot
of progress for the several services which they per-
form, but with the understanding that their pay
will not be less than it would have been under the
hourly rate which was in effect prior to July 1.
The footage price was established by using 650
feet as the basic progress for a month, and the
established monthly pay on the hourly rate for a
full month's work as the standard minimum. On
this basis the bonus is derived by multiplying the
number of feet advanced in excess of 650 feet by
the footage rate. The second month this ruling
was in effect the crews in the Scenic pioneer tun-
nel broke the world's record for advancing and
greater progress was recorded in both September
and October. All men directly engaged in the
heading operation or working at the face come
under the application of the bonus system, but the
bonus rate is different for the different services
and, as has been explained, depends on the hourly
rates of pay in effect prior to July 1. The several
grades of employees that participate in the bonus
are drillers and helpers, nippers, underground la-
borers and foremen, handy men, hoist operators,
mucker or shovel operators, brakcmen, motormen
and shifters, an average of 66 men in three crews
at every face.
In addition to the bonus, a "high camp" pennant
was designed and is given to the camp having the
best record for the previous month. There is a
friendly but none the less intense rivalry for the
pennant, which has changed hands several times.
The device on the pennant, the Great Northern
"goat," is pertinent and is the cause of good na-
tured gibes between camp adherents.
The following incident is indicative of the riv-
alry for the pennant, existing between camps. The
footage basis of payment went into effect at 7:45
a. m., July 1. The shift going off duty at this hour
in the Tye river incline had a round drilled and
loaded at 7:40. The progress had been so nearly
equal that they had the choice of shooting before
7:45 and taking the pennant away from Berne, or
holding the shot until after 7:45 and having the
footage apply on the July bonus. They did not
hesitate, but pulled the round and sacrificed the
bonus for the pennant.
AH gangs work eight hours, and those not en-
gaged in the mining operations are paid either an
hourly or a monthly rate. Men are not worked
overtime unless absolutely necessary, but when
they are required to do so, penalty overtime is
not paid. All operations are carried on continu-
ously three shifts a day, and seven days a week.
Source of Electric Power
In a tunneling operation of such magnitude only
air or electric power can be used to operate the
mining machines and haulage equipment. When
THE HEAD FRAME AT MILL CREEK TUNNEL READY
TO MOVE INTO PERMANENT POSITION
the work was started, no current was available at
either portal although arrangements were made to
bring power lines to these points as soon as
weather and snow conditions permitted. At the
west portal it was not possible, however, to com-
plete the power line earlier than about the middle
of the summer of 1926, and to avoid delay a gen-
erating station was established at Scenic. Two
360-horsepower and one . two-cylinder 120-horse-
power Fairbanks, Morse &amp; Co., Diesel engines
were installed to drive the generating equipment:
delivery of power from this plant began March 18
and continued to August 6, when the Great North-
ern power line from Everett, 97 miles, was com-
pleted. A maximum of 14,300-kw. hours a day is
used at the west portal in the mining and hauling
operation, the compressor room, and the repair
shop.
Electric traction is employed in the existing tun-
nel and the Great Northern constructed a power
line from Cascade, the east portal, to a frequency
changing station at Lanham Creek spur, from
which the power was distributed to Berne and
Mill Creek. This line and station were completed
April 17 and power is still being delivered at a
maximum rate of about 10,000-kw. hours a day.
All drilling machines are air operated and com-
plete compressor plants with electrically driven


March, 1927
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Sullivan angle compound compressors have been
established at all three camps. The plant at Scenic
contains five compressors of 950 cubic feet capacity
each, which compress the air to 110 pounds, but at
the other camps the number of working faces is
not so great and a smaller compressor capacity is
employed, although space is provided for addi-
tional equipment when needed. The air for ven-
tilation is supplied by electrically driven fans, and
is conducted to the point of delivery through sheet
metal pipes of the required size.
Storehouses and completely equipped repair
shops, with machine tools, forges, and other equip-
ment, are established at each camp, and a force of
skilled mechanics is employed so that repairs can
be made to practically ev'ery piece of equipment in
use. A section of the shop is set aside especially
for grinding and tempering drills.
Much Care Given to Camp Construction
The camp buildings are substantially constructed
and every effort has been made to give the men
clean, sanitary and comfortable quarters. Bunk
houses accommodate 10 men, and well equipped
bath houses with showers and laundry facilities are
placed at intervals in the camps to avoid crowding.
Sanitary toilets and sewage disposal have been
provided. Every camp has a commissary, a loung-
ing room, and a recreation building where lectures,
moving pictures or other entertainment may be
given and dances held. Separate houses have been
constructed for the men who have families and a
monthly allowance is given those who board them-
selves. The dining rooms are spacious; the kitch-
ens are -exceptionally well equipped and have bak-
eries of ample capacity to bake all the bread and
pastry used. Special houses have been built for the
engineering staff and the contractor's supervisory
forces.
The new alignment required the purchase of
a summer resort hotel at Scenic and this has been
partly remodeled to provide offices for the con-
tractor and the engineering forces. The accom-
modations are sufficient to house about 50 em-
ployees and such visitors as have business with
the railroad or contractor.
All three camps are in the mountains far from
school accommodations and to provide instruction
for the children in the camp, schoolhouses with
sanitary toilets and heating plants have been erect-
ed to care for 50 children at Scenic and 35 each
at Berne and Mill Creek. The local school au-
thorities provide the teaching force.
Line Changes
The east portal is below the elevation of the
present track at Berne so that a minor line change
and grade reduction was required to reach the tun-
nel. The present alignment in this section is very
crooked and, as a large amount of material which
otherwise would have to be wasted is available for
embankments, a revision of the line from Berne to
Merritt, 9l/2 miles, is being made to reduce the
heavy curvature and eliminate a number of snow
sheds. The only improvement in the grade, how-
ever, is that brought about by the slightly lower
elevation of the portal.
At Scenic, it was necessarv to construct about
two miles of new line to connect the tunnel with
the present track. Descending to the west, the
gradient is 1.7 per cent compensated for the first
mile west of the tunnel to provide for yard tracks.
The new line crosses the existing line twice, once
immediately east of Scenic station, where it is 32
feet higher than the old line, and again near the
junction of the two lines one mile farther west
where the difference in elevation is 5 feet. To fa-
cilitate dumping the material from the tunnel,
which is used to construct the embankment, a
temporary pile trestle has been driven from the
tunnel to the junction of the two lines. Directional
passing sidings for east and west-bound trains will
be constructed at both ends.
Chronology and Progress
The work of clearing the sites for the camps
began on December 1, 1925, The approach cut for
the west pioneer tunnel was commenced on De-
cember 14 and on December 29 the adit or side
drift, to reach the center heading at Berne, was
started. The drift for the Tye River incline was
begun on January 23, 1926, and the sinking of the
Mill Creek shaft was started on January 30. On
November 27, 1926, the advance faces in the drifts
had made the following penetrations:

The contract stipulates that the entire work
shall be completed not later than October 30, 1928.
and on March 1, 1926, after the preliminary work
was finished, a progress chart delineating the prog-
ress which must be made to accomplish this was

the city's credit, adds nothing to its bonded debt,
and will allow an initial operating fare of 10 cents
which can be reduced to very close to 5 cents by
the end of 10 years. Financing by a bond issue
could not possibly approximate this condition. As
a further argument in favor of this plan, the dif-
ference between Detroit's bonded debt and its
bonding limit is not sufficient to finance a rapid
transit system.
In regard to the question as to whether Detroit
is ready for rapid transit, it is pretty well agreed
that 45 minutes is enough time for a person to
spend in traveling from his home to work, includ-
ing the walk. On this basis, surface street cars
satisfactorily serve a town of 5-mile radius. Local
rapid transit will serve a 10-mile radius and ex-
press rapid transit a 15-mile radius. Detroit
proper has over-reached the 10-mile radius stage.
Out Grand River the city line is 14^ miles from
the city hall. A true transit system, however, is
not one of political boundaries. The towns and
cities adjacent to Detroit are as vitally interested
in the solution of the transit problem as Detroit
itself,
Space does not permit discussion of the num-
bers of comprehensive systems laid out and stud-
ied, nor the initial constructions selected for
analysis from the comprehensive layouts. Suffice
it to say that the office number of the initial sys-
tem finally adopted is No. 65.
As to type, the Commission is convinced that
the underground is much to be preferred to ele-
vated and worth the extra cost. Eventually there
will probably be some sections of elevated in the
Detroit system, but they will be in sections that
will not be damaged by it. The modern type of
elevated is much quieter and more sightly than
the older types used in New York and Chicago.
In the outlying sections, where 204-foot super-
highways are being acquired, the rapid transit fa-
cilities will run on the surface in an exclusive
84-foot, fenced right of way in the center of the
street. Cross traffic will be cared for at half-mile
intervals on a separated grade. This part of the
system thus will be able to make the same speed
as the subway sections and at a much less con-
struction cost. This type is carried toward the
center as far as it is economical to acquire the
right of way.
The soil under Detroit is in general a stiff blue
clay. It lends itself readily to tunneling opera-
tions. In sewer work in Detroit the contractors
commonly figure that if the cut is over 18 feet it
is cheaper to tunnel than open cut. The Commis-
sion has taken advantage of this condition and de-
signed a structure that is part subway and part
tunnel and coined the word "Tunnelway" to fit it.
The stations, about half a mile apart, are built
near the surface in open cut, while the tubes leave
the stations in both directions on a descending 3
per cent grade to a depth sufficient to avoid sewers
and other subsurface obstructions.
This profile has an operating advantage also, al-
lowing trains to accelerate on a down-grade and
decelerate on an up-grade. Stations will be framed
530 feet long, to accommodate 8-car trains. It is
not intended to "finish" the full station length to
start, as it will be some time before 8-car trains
are required. Each station will require special de-
sign, but the general type will be island platform
with overhead mezzanine. Heavier traffic stations
will have side platforms in addition to the island.
Between stations the construction will consist
of circular, concrete tubes of 18-foot outside

diameter and walls 16 inches thick. An earth core
of six to eight feet will separate the tubes, mak-
ing curvature unnecessary in entering stations.
All initial lines will be built of two-track capacity
and operated as local service. When traffic war-
rants it, two express tracks will be added out-
side.
A properly designed rapid transit system, like


March. 1927
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
a city plan, should be a diffusing influence rather
than a concentrator. For this reason the Rapid
Transit Commission has favored a four-line ini-
tial system, only two lines of which would come
downtown. For financial reasons, however, it
has been thought best to start with two lines.
The accompanying cut shows in heavy lines the
arrangement of the first two lines, with station lo-
cations. The two lighter lines represent the two
lines deferred to a later date.

color subjects. Contrast of warm and cool color
and of dark and light value is the life of all
graphic art. In oil, the pigment itself is so
sensuous, has such reality, that good design may
be achieved even with rather close color and value
harmony. In water-color, the pigment has so lit-
tle body that the design must rely on striking in-
tervals of warm and cool color, of dark and light
value, not only for its interest but for its very
existence. For this reason, architecture, intimate
landscape, and any subject in strong light and
shade has an especial value for the water-color
painter.

glance, this unevenness is not apparent, and the
results obtained are very unusual.
In order to preserve the vertical line effect, the
spandrel sections which are also of terra cotta, have
been made a different color than the main body of
the building. The colors chosen is rather a metal
color, and blends with the window-surface to such
an extent as to destroy any appearance of hori-
zontal lines. Care was also taken in the selection
of the window shades. Light shades would have
given a very restless appearance to the building
when unevenly drawn, so special shades of a simi-
lar color to the spandrels were chosen. This might
seem an unimportant detail, but nevertheless was
necessary to carry out the effect.
The American Insurance Union is a fraternal
insurance company. It is universal in its scope,
and insures all classes and types of people. This
spirit of fraternalism and protection, also the patri-
otic spirit evidenced in its by-laws have found
expression in the details of the terra cotta.
The spandrel sections are designed to represent
the universe. Four alternate schemes have been
used, representing the sun, the moon, the stars,
and the earth. The five races of man are depicted
in the Bas-relief in the frieze at the eighteenth
story. The American eagle is shown perched at
the four corners of the building in a protecting
attitude, while topping the pediments on each fa-
cade of the tower is a group representing pro-
tection or insurance.
The stack which runs up through the entire
building to the top of the tower is encompassed
by a terra cotta tripod, making a fitting finale to
the design.
There are forty-two concrete caissons supporting
this building, extending from the curb line one
hundred twelve feet to solid rock. These caissons
are approximately eight feet square, and had to be
sunk under air pressure through eighty feet of
water. The main tower elevators are what are
known as the "micro self-leveling type" and are
automatically controlled by push buttons. They
operate at a speed of 900 feet per minute, and
each cab is equipped with automatic self-closing
doors instead of the usual gates. The main ele-
vators run to the forty-first floor, from this point
a shuttle elevator extends to the forty-seventh, or
observation floor.
ON THE HURON
This building presented many mechanical prob-
lems, of which the placing of large tanks for pro-
viding water for both utilitarian purposes and fire
protection located at two different levels are rep-
resentative. The main pressure tanks have been
placed at the twenty-third floor, and additional


Page 31
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
auxiliary tanks have been placed at the forty-third
floor. Duplicate mechanical installations have been
provided throughout, and if any piece of apparatus
is out of order, emergency apparatus would im-
mediately and automatically be utilized.
It has taken nearly two years to construct this
building, and when finally completed and dedicated
next July, it should prove a mecca for students of
architecture and engineering.
BEET SUGAR
(Continued from page 17)
because each lot of beets is analyzed before go-
ing into the mill. So this weighing is the first
of the exact checks to which the material is sub-
jected.
Once the beets have been cut into the V-shaped
slices—or "chips" to use the term generally em-
ployed—they are carried to the diffusion battery.
The description of this stage of the process in a
non-technical article is by no means easy, because
it is exceedingly complicated, there are a great
number of factors involved, and the men in charge
of the batteries have either to be technical men
or so experienced in their work that their famil-
iarity with the exacting details of the process
amounts to technical knowledge. The object of
the process is simple enough; the chips are im-
mersed in warm water so that the sugar will
diffuse through the walls of the cells. The actual
operation is not so simple. The number of dif-
fusers in such a battery varies from six to sixteen,
sometimes in straight line arrangement, more often
set in a circle. The diffuser is a large, cylin-
drical container, similar in appearance to the
boiler of a stationary engine. The series of dif-
fusers is connected by a pipe-line, which carries
the water in at the top of one, out at its bot-
tom, in at the top of the next, and so on.
The work of the diffusers is to bring about a dif-
fusion of the two liquids—that contained inside
the cells of the "chipped" beets and the warm
water which is introduced through the pipes. But
the soaking of the chips in warm water will not
bring this result, or it would never have been
necessary to perfect the form of apparatus now
in general use. In the early days of the industry,
the extraction of the cell-juice was effected by
immersing the beet-pulp in water heated to a
high temperature, but the difficulties of this
method, two in number, were both serious: the
great number of crushed cells in the pulp made
the complete extraction of the sugar-bearing juice
impossible, and the long immersion of the beet-
pulp in very hot water dissolved other elements
of the pulp, so that the juice which was finally
drawn off contained impurities not easily removed
in the further stages of the process.
So the principle on which the battery operates
is that of allowing the chips in the first diffuser
of the series to remain in contact with a measured
amount of water at a known temperature for a
certain length of time, then drawing off the water
with its added load of cell-juice and introducing
it into the next diffuser in the chain, the liquid
—juice instead of water after it passes out of the
first diffuser, and carrying an added load of sugar
in solution with each fresh stage—being reheated
between every two diffuscrs.
THE BEACH AT LIPARI
This method of controlled diffusion extracts the
maximum amount of sugar-bearing juice from
the cells, and reduces to as great an extent as poss-
ible the solution of those elements in the beet
which form impurities in the juice. It will be
readily apparent that the number of factors in-
volved—the quality of the chips, regulation of heat,
water-flow, and so on, make this stage of the
process at once intricate and critical and place
a high responsibility upon the men in charge of
the battery.
In the diffusion battery there also takes place
the first separation of the raw material. After the
beet-chips have been subjected to the diffusion
process up to the point where there is danger of
breaking down and dissolving into the liquid some
of the undesirable elements in the beets, the pulp
has ceased to be of any further importance in the
making of sugar and becomes a by-product. It
is carried from the diffusers into presses where
most of the water is squeezed out of it, then into
driers, and then out of the mill with a very fair
commercial value as cattle feed.
The liquid, as it comes from the diffusion bat-
tery, is known as "raw juice." It is carried, by
way of measuring-tanks, to the second stage in
the process, the "first carbonatation." Into the
raw juice there is first introduced milk of lime for
its purification or defecation, then carbon diox-
ide, taken from the lime-kiln whch is a necessary
part of the plant, is blown through the juice, act-
ing as a reagent for the precipitation of the lime.


March, 1927
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The perfecting of this operation of carbonatation
is a modern development in the industry. It was
formerly believed that the action of carbonic acid
on juices which had not been filtered would be
that of a solvent upon the precipitated mat, so
that the process was usually delayed until after
the filtration of the liquid had been completed.
The modern practice is to introduce the juice into
the carbonatation tanks in its unfiltered state. In
many cases the process of defecation is also per-
formed in these tanks, and there is no separate ap-
paratus required for the first operation.
Usually the distribution of the gas is managed
through perforated pipes in the bottom of the
tanks, which are either round or square in shape,
the general modern preference being for the lat-
ter. These pipes secure an effective distribution
of the gas, their defect being that the small holes
are easily clogged. This disadvantage has been
in large measure overcome by making it easy to
disconnect and remove the pipes so that another
set can be installed while the first are being cleaned.
After the first carbonatation, the "first juice" as
it is now termed, passes through filters, the
waste from this process going directly to the
sewers or other waste-disposal channels, while
the juice is subjected to the second carbonatation,
precisely like the first save that it is more ac-
curately controlled. From the second carbonata-
tion tanks this "second juice," after another fil-
tration, goes through the sulphur tanks—a step
in the manufacture about which there is some
little general misconception.
The introduction of sulphur dioxide is not de-
signed for the purpose of preserving or bleaching,
and there is no trace of sulphur in the finished
product as it comes from the mill. The sulphur
dioxide serves to remove the last traces of alka-
linity in the juice which has been developed dur-
ing the various treatments to which it has been
subjected.
Just beyond another set of filters which lie be-
tween the sulphur-tanks and the evaporators, there
is a separation in the juice, a small part of the
"thin juice" going into a by-pass and being car-
ried, by way of the "melters" clear back to the
"second carbonatation" stage of its journey through
the mill while the rest of the "second juice'' goes
directly into multiple - effect evaporators, from
which it issues as "thick juice" and goes, by way
of a final sulphur-tank and filter, into the "white
pan," where the juice is evaporated to grain in a
vacuum-pan.
This almost final stage in the process is even
more critical than the handling of the diffusion
tanks, and here, as elsewhere in the business, the
decisive element must be human judgment instead
of the operation of automatic machinery. It is a
problem in the maintenance of nice adjustments,
where the man in control must act in accordance
with knowledge born of practical experience. In
the white pan, he must, through skillful control
of heat, the amount of juice, and so on, guide the
formation of the sugar-crystals, but he can do this
only by checking scientifically the natural progress
of the grain-formation. The sugar, as finally drawn
from the white pan, must be even in grain. The
tendency during the process is toward the forma-
tion of new grains while those first produced by
the evaporation are increasing in size. If allowed
to go unchecked, this would result in sugar in
which the grains were of unequal size. So the
task of the workman is to watch his mixture with
the eye of a hawk, assisting, through the agencies
at his command, the growth of grains of the de-
sired size, but preventing the development of the
smaller grains.
This final boiling is done in "batches" but up to
this stage, the process has been continuous.
From the centrifugals beyond the white pan, the
sugar goes to the sacking room by way of the
driers and scales, while the "green syrup" is car-
ried to the "brown pan," where, by similar meth-
ods, it is transported by crystallizers and cen-
trifugals, to brown sugar. This brown sugar, how-
ever, is not edible, and is carried to the melters.
whence, with the "thin juice" already mentioned,
it passes through pipes and goes back into the
second carbonatation tanks.
The final separation occurs in the centrifugals
lying beyond the brown pan, the molasses being
spun oft" while the brown sugar goes to the melt-
ers. Like the brown sugar, this molasses is not
edible. In mills which are without the equipment
for carrying out the "Steffens process" this mo-
lasses is sold for cattle food. The Steffens process,
through the use of lime from the kiln, subjects this
molasses to cold filtration, boiling and further fil-
tration, returning most of the sugar from the mo-
lasses, known as "hot saccharate," to the second
carbonatation tanks, so that only the last of the
filtrate is actual waste.
Owing to the peculiar conditions which govern
it, the beet-sugar mill occupies a peculiar place in
the industrial life of a community. The "open sea-
son" is short, and in consequence the labor is con-
tinuous and concentrated once it has begun. As
already stated, a "campaign" lasting 100 days is
most unusual, and the average is perhaps nearer
80 than 90 days. The day of actual opening varies
according to the weather conditions, the accumu-
lation of beets on hand, and there must be no loss
of valuable time. Beets held in storage must be
used before their sugar-content has diminished to
such an extent as to cause an appreciable loss, and
every provision must be made in advance for ade-


Page 33
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
quate handling of the transportation of the beets
from the field to mill, as the facilities for storage
possessed by the grower are naturally inferior to
those of the mill itself. In consequence, the sugar-
manufacturer must have his forces mobilized in
plenty of time for the beginning of the intensive
campaign, and yet, as the machinery of a beet-
sugar mill is useless for any other purpose, all
the employment he can find for his corps of labor-
ers during the nine months that the mill stands
idle is in the making of such repairs as are re-
quired by the wear and tear of the season just
closed.
In Michigan, as in many other parts of the coun-
try, this labor difficulty takes care of itself to a
considerable extent because the sugar-maker be-
comes a "migratory fowl." The beet-sugar-making
season in Michigan and other parts of the United
States and the cane-sugar-making season in Cuba
do not overlap, so the real craftsmen of the busi-
ness—such as the men in charge of the white pan
—go south with the end of one season and come
north with the beginning of the next, the processes
of refining cane-sugar and beet-sugar being near
enough alike so that a good sugar-boiler is equally
valuable in Cuba or Michigan.
The list of the Michigan mills, with the date of
erection and the capacity in tons of beets worked
per 24 hours, is as follows:

go very far as a designing engineer or in research.
To sum up, to succeed well in electrical engi-
neering a student should have at least reasonable
ability in mathematics and physics but some de-
ficiency in this respect may be compensated for if
he loves to make things with his own hands or if
he has a real interest in business engineering.
MOBILIZATION
(Continued from page 23)
The completion of a factory plan for a finished
article by no means completes the planning neces-
sary for the assurance of the required production.
The factory plan shows various requirements, such
as machine tools, gauges, components, and partly
fabricated parts to be sub-contracted for, and final-
ly, raw materials, with recommendations as to
preferred sources of supply; and, when received
by the district chief, it is his duty to assure him-
self that these materials and supplies can be ob-
tained in the amounts and at the rates required
from the preferred source, or if not, he must locate
other sources. This in turn requires additional fac-
tory plans from the sub-contractors so that this
process is continued until we get back to the
source of all manufactured products, that is, the
raw materials. In cases where the sources of ma-
terials or supplies needed for prime contracts in
any one district are located in other districts, a
request in the form of a sub-procurement schedule
for the material or supplies desired is submitted
by the chief of the district having the prime con-
tract to the chief of the district in which the pre-
ferred source is located, and, when accepted by the
latter, it becomes an order upon his facilities and
his responsibility for assuring the required supply.
To enable prompt and just agreements to be
made for war-time production of munitions, a War
Department board has been appointed to prepare
war contract forms for use by all branches of the
War Department. In the preparation of these
forms, the board has studied the various difficul-
ties that arose during the World War and there-
after in the settling of contracts terminated before
completion by the ending of the war. It has con-
sulted freely with district chiefs and other leaders
of industry. It believes it has succeeded in draw-
ing up contract forms and a definition of contract
costs to accompany them that will be clear of
purpose, easy of interpretation, and eminently fair
to the contractor and the government. Provision
is made in these forms for adjustment of the con-
tract price because of authorized changes in cost
of labor and material in the case of contracts tak-
ing considerable time to complete. Except for the
simplest contracts of short duration, provision is
also made for continuous payments to the con-
tractor for material purchased and work done from
the time of commencing work and without waiting
for deliveries. In this plan the profit to the manu-
facturer will be upon a sliding scale graduated in
such a way that the more economically he can pro-
duce the article the larger will be his profit.
The method outlined above has been in opera-
tion, with minor changes, for about four years and
has proved very satisfactory. Its success rests en-
tirely upon the patriotic co-operation of industry
without whose sympathetic support even the best
conceived industrial plans must fail; and the co-
operation of industry has been very gratifying in-
deed to the War and Navy Departments.

TECHNICAL ABSTRACTS

Efficiency of Power Plants is Increased
While Michigan's power companies were pro-
ducing more electricity than ever before in their
history, during 1926, the steam power plants,
which produced 76 per cent of the total energy
requirements of the state, were establishing new
records of efficiency in the use of coal, according
to the computations just completed by the Michi-
gan Public Utility Information Bureau, Ann Ar-
bor.
During the year the general average for all util-
ity power plants in the state was 1.61 pounds of
coal burned to produce each kilowatt-hour, com-
pared with 2.62 pounds required in 1920. In the
early days of the art, generating plants consumed
from seven to 10 pounds of coal per kilowatt-hour.
Since 1920, the average amounts of coal required
by Michigan utility plants to generate one kilo-
watt-hour were: 1921, 2.26 pounds; 1922, 2.09
pounds; 1923, 1.99 pounds; 1924, 1.86 pounds;
1925, 1.68 pounds, and 1926, 1.61 pounds.
Had the 2,605,515,000 kilowatt-hours of electric-
ity generated by the state's steam plants in 1926
been produced in generating stations operating
under 1920 plant conditions, the bureau figured,
the utilities would have required 3,413,224 tons of
coal. The utilities actually consumed only 2,108,-
957 tons during the year.
The efficiency records are the result of the pol-
icy of adopting developments as rapidly as science
pronounces them feasible, according to the bureau.
Development of large steam turbine - generators,
boilers capable of using increased percentages of
the total heat in coal, and high voltage lines which
enable system operators to co-ordinate electric re-
quirements of large regions, are factors in making
possible such efficiency.
Michigan's utility power plants are well above
the average for the nation in efficiency, a com-
parison with figures of the U. S. Geological Sur-
vey showed. During 1926, the general average for
all utility power plants in the country was 1.95
pounds of coal per kilowatt-hour generated, com-
pared with Michigan's average of 1.61.—Michigan
Public Utilitv Information Bureau.
Cost of Standardization
Reports to the committee on standardization at
Washington show that more than $7,250,000 is ex-
pended annually for standardization. The com-
mittee of which Secretary of Commerce Herbert
Hoover is chairman and W. C. Wetherill is sec-
retary includes some of the most prominent in-
dustrial leaders and engineers of the country.
The survey of national standardization has been
taken up with the committee in co-operation with
the American Engineering Council. Information
gathered from work already done at the Bureau of
Standards left only the amount of expenditures for
standardization to be obtained. A report will prob-
ably be submitted in the near future, the purpose
of which will be to make a complete statement of
the current status of standardization in the United
States. After the report is made there probably
will be a general conference to consider it and to
adopt whatever action will, in the opinion of the
conference, stimulate and expedite co-ordination
of all standardization activities.
Since 1926 important progresses are reported in
the mining and mechanical industries and in in-
dustrial safety. Mining standards formally ap-
proved include safety rules for installing and using
electrical equipment in coal mines. Work on the
drainage of coal mines, outside handling equipment
and wire ropes for mines has been submitted for
approval.
Mechanical standards are being developed on ex-
tensive plans. A tentative American standard for
tooth form of spur gears has been submitted for
approval. Several sections of work on bolt, nut.
and rivet proportions and of pipe flanges and fit-
tings are near completion.
Specifications for railroad ties, satisfactory for
both steam and electric railroads have been agreed
upon during the year and specifications for tubular
steel poles and for girder rails have been unified
and approved as tentative American standards.—
The Iron Age.
Surface Hardening Steel by New Process
A new surface-hardened special steel, made by
a process evolved by Dr. Fry of the research lab-
ratories of Messrs. Fredrich Krupp, of Essen, Ger-
many, is finding a field of usefulness in the auto-
motive and aviation industries of Europe. The
material is especially suitable for parts requiring
a highly hardened metal. Ring gears, crankshafts,
camshafts, and other parts—which are subjected to


Page 35
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
maximum punishment—are being made of this ma-
terial for several high priced foreign cars. License
to manufacture the steel in this country under the
trade name "Nitralloy" has been secured by one
of the large American steel companies.
The process of hardening termed nitration, is based
on diffusion—nitrogen being allowed to penetrate
the surface. Briefly stated, it consists of heating
the steel to a temperature not exceeding 1025° F.
in the presence of ammonia gas. Because the hard-
ing process is carried out at a relatively low tem-
perature, the necessity of heat treatment for grain
refinement and ultimate hardness is eliminated. It
is this subsequent heat treatment, it is contended,
that impairs the hardness of case-hardened steels
through expansion, deformation, or actual break-
age in the final quenching operation. As there is
no warping or deformation attending the nitrogen
process, articles can be finished and in some cases
even polished before harding.
Tests conducted at the Krupp works indicate
that the highest degree of hardness penetrates to a
depth of approximately two-tenths of a millimeter,
from which point it diminishes gradually. It is
claimed that the surface of nitrated steel will re-
tain its hardness in any heat up to 1025° F.—Com-
pressed Air Magazine.
rounded by a ball of purplish haze, which attains
about two feet in diameter with a pressure of 350,-
000 volts. This is ascribed to the ionization of the
air. The new tube thus offers many interesting
possibilities, and there are doubtless many effects
still to be discovered and investigated.—The Il-
luminating Engineer.
Experiment* with the New Coolidge
Cathode-Ray Tube
Much interest has been aroused in scientific cir-
cles by the new cathode-ray tube devised by Dr.
W. D. Coolidge, who is associated with the re-
search laboratories of the General Electric Com-
pany. The cathode-ray tube, like radium, is con-
stantly bombarding high-speed electrons into space,
but at a rate that is strictly under control and at
a considerably lower average velocity. The rays
can however be highly concentrated and many
striking experiments can be performed with them.
Crystals of mineral calcite glow with an intense
orange light when exposed to these rays, and this
glow of "cold light" will continue for hours. Gran-
ite, a mixture of various minerals, glows with va-
ried colors; some very fugitive, but others persist-
ing for some time after exposure. Ordinary salt
is turned to a brown color and castor oil is solidi-
fied. One of the most curious and interesting re-
sults of applying the rays is the formation of a
new yellow compound in acetylene gas. This com-
pound is highly insoluble and a use may be found
for it as a protective material for metals. The ef-
fect of the rays on living tissues is very marked;
exposure of a tenth of a second caused temporary
loss of hair on the car of a rabbit, and an ex-
posure of one minute caused a scab to form, and
ultimately a hole in the ear. When the tube is
operated in a darkened room it appears to be sur-
Transparent Sheet Steel
Sheet steel, as transparent as the clearest glass,
is the invention of Dr. Karl Mueller of Berlin.
Sheet steel of this description and of unprece-
dented thinness is likely to prove of far reaching
industrial as well as scientific importance. It may
be used as a membrane for the separation of gases,
or lend itself admirably to the promotion of tele-
vision and telephotography.
Test plates used to determine the transparency
of optical glass, and which were ruled with cross
lines 2,500 to the square inch, were photographed
through such a metal sheet. When enlarged to
400 diameters, the scale lines showed distinctly
with no trace of distortion. This absence of aber-
ration conclusively proved that the structure of
the film was perfectly even and equal in all di-
rections. Even though the metal sheets are so thin
that atoms will penetrate them without impedi-
ment, yet, when fastened in a frame, they are
strong enough to be bent one-sixteenth inch with-
out rupture. The delicate sheets are made by-
depositing an extremely fine film of the metal on
a smooth surface by means of electric current, and
then separating the film from the foundation on
which it is fixed.—Compressed Air Magazine.
Phenol Improves Coal Oil for Diesel Engine Use
Continuous experiments over an extended period
with a 500-horsepower Diesel engine have demon-
strated that fuels rich in phenol and similar com-
pounds produce beneficial results. On this subject
Mr. A. Spilken, in Brennstoff-Chimie says, "Al-
though the phenols contain more oxygen than or-
dinary hydro-carbon oils and although the thermal
efficiency of the engines is therefore reduced, they
cause much cleaner combustion to take place. Cor-
rosion, especially of the piston rings and cylinder
liners is reduced, while the standard compression
of the engine is therefore maintained for longer
periods of time without resetting. Lubrication con-
ditions, the author also maintains, are improved
because of the reduced tendency toward the for-
mation of gummy and tarry residues. If these re-
sults are confirmed, it would seem as though un-
desirable fuels could be rendered fit for Diesel
engine use by adding the required amounts of
phenol compounds.—Compressed Air Magazine.

Items of Interest to Michigan Engineers
HIGHWAY ENGINEERING CONFERENCE
More than 600 highway engineers and road com-
missioners attended the thirteenth annual High-
way Engineering Conference, held under the joint
auspices of the University and the State Highway
Department, which opened here February 15, and
continued through February 18.
At the first official session of the conference,
Dean A. N. Johnson of the College of Engineering
at the University of Maryland, talked on "Con-
crete Road Construction and Maintenance."
One of the features of the meeting was a smoker
held at the Union, Wednesday evening. At this
time Professor H. E. Riggs spoke on "Special
Libraries and Collections of Historical and Statis-
tical Material."
The principal speaker at the closing session on
Friday was Inspector Gustav Schink of the De-
troit Traffic Department. The subject of his talk
was "From the Standpoint of the Police Official."
In his talk he stressed the co-operation that should
exist between the traffic departments and the road
engineers in order to insure maximum safety for
motorists on streets and highways.
On the twenty-fifth of February, the students of
the Architectural College held a smoker at the
Masonic Temple. The principal speaker of the eve-
ning was Wirt Rowland, Chief Designer for Smith,
Hinchman &amp; Grylls, Detroit architects. Mr. Row-
land spoke on his "Impressions of European Ar-
chitecture." About one hundred fifty architectural
students attended, and the Architectural Society,
which sponsored the smoker, considered the affair
a decided success. Entertainment was provided by
a campus orchestra, and cider and doughnuts fol-
lowed by smokes completed the evening. It is
planned to hold another smoker a little later in
the year.
o
The annual banquet of the Junior Engineers was
held at Joe Parker's Cafe, March 9. A team of pro-
fessional dancers and an orchestra furnished the
entertainment. Thomas King acted as toastmaster
and introduced Professor J. L. Brumm, of the
Journalistic Department, who gave the address of
the evening.
Professor H. E. Riggs, of the Civil Engineering
Department, is on leave of absence this semester
doing consulting work for the New York Central
Railroad. Professor Louis M. Gram is acting head
of the department during Professor Riggs' ab-
sence. L. E. Ayres, of the firm of Ayres, Lewis,
Norris and May, Ann Arbor consulting engineers,
has taken charge of Professor Riggs' classes for
the remainder of the year.
A. S. C. E.
The regular monthly meeting of "the A. S. C. E.
was held at the Michigan Union, 'March 8. The
speaker of the evening was Mr. Nellis, of the De-
troit Edison Company, who told of the results
obtained by the 1926 experiments of the Detroit
Edison Company on the design and control of
concrete mixers, in which the water ratio theory
of Dr. Abrams was used.
At the last meeting of the society, the officers
for the past semester were all unanimously re-
elected for the remainder of the vear.
Professor H. E. Riggs, head of the Civil Engi-
neering Department, during a talk before the thir-
teenth annual Highway Engineering Conference,
told of the development of the transportation li-
brary from its beginning to its present status as
one of the best in the world.
The library was first begun by Professor John
S. Worley, visiting lecturer on transportation en-
gineering, who donated his first year's salary to
start the collection. Upon finding that the univers-
ity had no books of this nature, Alex Dow, Presi-
dent of the Detroit Edison Company, was inter-
ested in the idea and donated $25,000 to the fund.
A prominent automobile manufacturer was then
approached, but was disinterested in the propo-
sition until shown a collection of prints of old au-
tomobile models. He then donated $4,000 for the
library. About twenty other men were then found,
each of whom donated $4,000, and the transpor-
tation library was started on its career.
Among the books contained in the library may
be found some of the most valuable treatises in the
world on the subject of transportation engineering.

AERONAUTICAL DEPARTMENT
In order to satisfy the request of numerous stu-
dents who wish to take aeronautical courses with-
out entering into the regular aeronautical engi-
neering curriculum, the Engineering College has
arranged to offer a course in aviation. The course
offers two hours credit and is open to any student
in the university.
The subjects which will be taught in this course
include aerology, structure and rigging, aviation
engines, theory of flight, aerodynamical instru-
ments and sea navigation.
Lectures in these various subjects will be given
by professors of the different departments; the
geology department will take care of the aerology
phase; members of the mechanical engineering fac-
ulty will lecture on "Aviation Engines," while a
professor of astronomy will lecture on "Sea Navi-
gation."

Getting By
Show us the man who is "getting by,"
And brags of that fact himself,
And we'll show you a sort of half-baked guy,
Who will soon be laid on the shelf.
He's the man Bostonians call a "slob,"
He's one of the listless flock,
And he keeps one eye on his hated job
And the other eye on the clock.
He curses the fate that makes men toil
For the things that mortals crave—.
The fate that thrusts man under the soil
To his only rest, the grave.
Oh, not for him is the struggle grim,
And he winks a knowing eye,
And tells the toilers whose pleasures are slim,
How well he is "getting by."
Pity the men who are "getting by"
In this game of existence here;
For youthful play old age will pay
And the price it pays is dear.
The gate to success is wide and high,
And beyond it fair blossoms grow,
But the fellow contented with "getting by"
Will never get by to know.

RESEARCH NARRATIVE

What the power houses of a hundred years from
now may be like no one would dare to predict.
Probably they will be as different from those we
have today as Faraday's jars full of chemicals to
make a battery were from New York City's newest
castle for its millions of electric slaves. But what-
ever is to come we may be sure that its founda-
tions are now in preparation in our laboratories of
scientific research. The pipe line of science flows
forever and its flow seems never to grow less.

Echoes from the Graduates
ALBERT J. ROUSSEAU
OF THE sciences of our civilization, archi-
tecture builds for us monuments which shall
stand to our posterity as the most forceful
expression of our attainments. We of Ann Arbor
and the University of Michigan are indeed for-
tunate to have in our midst one who by the merit
of both achievement and inborn ability has shown
true leadership in architecture.
We speak of Mr. Albert J.
Rousseau, Professor of Archi-
tecture in the College of Archi-
tecture.
He was born in the city of
Quebec, of an old French fam-
ily, who crossed from Norman-
dy to find the fleur-de-lis wav-
ing on the ancient fortress. As
a young boy studying in a pri-
vate school and later at the
Academy of St. Savior, he
showed such marked interest in
things pertaining to the arts
and mechanics, that the future
of the child was easily appar-
ent. Not long after his entrance
at St. Savior, his taste for
drawing and unusual mechan-
ical skill with small toys at-
tracted the attention of a tal-
ented Parisian instructor, who
tutored h i m unsparingly, not
only in the arts, but also in sciences, mathematics,
and the languages, with the result that young
Rousseau passed the examination for admission to
the study of architecture in the Province of Que-
bec at the age of sixteen.
The difficult task of finding a suitable office for
the pursuit of his professional studies was simpli-
fied by the acceptance of an offer which he re-
ceived from Mr. Joseph P. Ouellet, who later be-
came President of the Royal Architectural Insti-
tute of Canada. Here, under skillful direction, his
studies were pushed vigorously so that he suc-
cessfully passed the final examination for the prac-
PROF. ALBERT J. ROUSSEAU
tice of architecture in the Province of Quebec
while he was twenty-one years old, the youngest
"architecte diplome" since the charter had been
intrusted to the architects of the province.
The admiration which the young man developed
for the architecture of the Old World gave him a
strong desire to acquire more knowledge in this
field, so after two more years
with Mr. Ouellet, he sailed to
Europe in the spring of 1909,
and went directly to Paris with
hopes of entering the famous
Ecole Nationals Superieure de
Beaux Arts, mecca of archi-
tects. For a period of five
years, he was associated with
Mr. L. Beviere, Architect, D.
P. L. G., and Inspector of the
Public Monuments of the City
of Paris, taking an active part
in almost all the architectural
competitions held in France at
the time. His office frequently
took first place.
During this period, he stud-
ied diligently, for the contest
for admission to the Ecole Na-
tionale Superieure des Beaux
Arts, and for that purpose he
took work under the expert
guidance of Professor Eugene
Chifflot, another prominent French architect. Soon
he was ready for the challenge and was admitted
in the third place in a contest which gathered can-
didates, to the number of eight hundred, from the
foremost architectural institutions of the world.
Now M. Rousseau entered the "atelier" of Louis
Bernier, Architect, D. P. L. G., Grand Prix de
Rome, and Member of the Institute of France,
and after three years of study under this renowned
master, M. Rousseau won the First Prize Jouie, the
only man from this side of the Atlantic to attain
such an honor.
During the next few years, he continued his


Page 39
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
studies, traveling extensively through many parts
of Europe, and taking a prominent part in many
of the architectural contests held at the time.
About ten years ago, while visiting in America,
he received an offer to join the staff of the College
of Architecture of the University of Michigan in
the capacity of Professor of Architecture. Since
his advent here, many of the students have been
fortunate enough to know the sincerity of his
friendship, and the high degree of esteem with
which he is regarded, tells us that he possesses a
remarkable personality, and is a true student of
human nature as well as art. When the years of
tireless effort and ceaseless preparation spent in
study and practice are considered, we are able to
see why Professor Rousseau's professional work
has reached such a high pinnacle of excellence that
he attained "honorable mention" for his design for
the Chicago Tribune Tower, two years ago. The
jury, who commented on the "beauty and original-
ity" of his design, were judging the work of the
highly skilled and foremost thinkers in "stone and
steel" from all parts of the world, some twenty-
nations being represented.
He is a member of many professional, scientific
and literary societies, including the Royal Institute
of Canada, Academic Latine des Sciences, Arts, et
Belles-Lettres, Paris; Societe Academique d'His-
toire Internationale; American Association for the
Advancement of Science, and the Michigan So-
ciety of Architects.
Professor Rousseau believes that the architect
should keep in touch with the progress of human
knowledge and also be able to execute with his
own hands the designs which he conceives on
paper. He, himself, is an exceptionally clever
craftsman in this type of work. Remarkable for
the harmony of its lines and proportions, the out-
standing example of his work in Ann Arbor is
the new Masonic Temple, which he designed as
a member of the firm of Rousseau and McConkey.
Students of architecture in this college may well
ponder on the stroke of fortune which has given
them a chance for contact and perhaps friendship
with a man standing head and shoulders above in
the field of architecture, as does Professor Albert
I. Rousseau.

THE HUMANITIES IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION
Bv PROFESSOR J. RALEIGH NELSON
ONE of the rather surprising developments in
the field of engineering education during the
past decade is the insistence on the value of
the Humanities in the prepa-
ration of the engineering stu-
dent for his profession. In the
evolution of engineering cur-
ricula there has been an in-
creasing emphasis on those
subjects which have cultural
value, and which have no im-
mediate or practical bearing on
the training of the student for
a particular task. This demand
for humanistic elements in the
scheme of engineering educa-
tion is. of course, only the na-
tural fruitage of a fine old tra-
dition, which from the very
beginning aimed to raise agri-
culture and the mechanic arts
to the rank of the learned pro-
fessions; but coming to a con-
scious expression as it has in
the present generation, it finds
a ready response from the stu-
dents of engineering t h e m -
selves. It seems likely to meet their restless im-
patience at the narrow limits &lt;•{ the specialized
courses, and to provide them with new and larger
freedom in the choice of the means -if education.
Certainly it is an influence to be reckoned with in
the swift changes that seem likely in the near tu-
tu re to result in the re-vamping of the whole scheme
of engineering education.
Since the terms "Humanities" and "humanistic"
PROF. J. RALEIGH NELSON
are bandied about, even by educators, as cabalistic
names to conjure with, and by students, naturally
enough, are confused with "human," "humane,"
"humanitarian," and all the
other derivatives of the Latin
word "homo," it may be well
to agree upon the fundamental
idea involved in the use of
these words to distinguish cer-
tain classes of subjects in the
curriculum. Historically, when
the educational system was
simpler,—and perhaps more
fundamental, and technical ed-
ucation had not been horn,—
the Humanities and Theology
shared the field between them.
Theology taught one his rela-
tions to God. In an age of
theological controversy, these
relations were quite complicat-
ed enough to provide a man a
life task. The Humanities, by
contrast, were all those sub-
jects which helped a man sense
his relation to the world of
men, his place in history, his
obligations and duties to those about him, and to
enter, by the magic of his imagination, into all the
rich inheritance that was his through the records of
literature and art. They made it possible for him
to stand up and face life with a consciousness that
he was a member of society, and a citizen of the
world.
One has only to listen in on the discussions of
engineering educators anywhere, or to read the re-

ports of committees and boards of investigation, to
note that in their insistence on the important func-
tion of the Humanities, they have more or less con-
sciously in mind this original meaning of the word.
Certain it is that the term is used constantly to
distinguish those studies that are non-professional,
and which will he a part of the developmental ex-
perience of the student, rather than a part of his
training for a job,—studies which will give him
judgment and taste, rather ^__^^^_^^^^^
than skill.
The Committee on the Study
of Engineering Education in
our own college defined the
cultural or humanistic studies
as those "which will be de-
signed to develop the student's
capacity to understand life,
broaden his outlook on life, and
enrich his enjoyment of life,
and which, when correlated
with specialized training, will
tend to make him more useful
to society." The object of such
studies is well stated by the
same Committee in its report
on the aims of Freshman As-
sembly:
"To show more clearly and
convincingly the fundamental dependence of sound
engineering upon science, the increasing importance
of human relationships in engineering, and the high
value of linguistic training, and thus to broaden and
deepen the student's interest in the non-technical
elements of his curriculum.
"To present to the student some of the important
human problems of the past and of the present, as
a means of cultivating intelligent interest in and
ability to think on extra-engineering matters."
The term "Humanities" is used among engineer-
ing educators, then, to distinguish those studies
which are non-technical and which serve to broaden
and deepen a student's educational experience, and
to develop his sense of relationship to mankind, at
large, of "humanity" in its original meaning.
The present demand for more of the Humanities
in engineering education, is simply one evidence of
a swing back to fundamentals that is likely to pro-
duce revolutionary changes in engineering educa-
tion in the immediate future. The original cur-
riculum brought back from France in 1849 by Pro-
fessor Greene of Kensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
was a combination of the curricula of "L'Ecole Cen-
trale des Arts et des Manufacteurs." and of "L'Ecole
Polytechnique." One-half of it aimed to lay a foun-
dation of fundamental science as a ba&gt;is for all en-
gineering, the other half to develop proficiency in
some special line. The enormous expansion of sci-

SON, head of the English
Department in the College of En-
gineering, is the Chairman of the
Committee on English of the So-
ciety for the Promotion of Engi-
neering Education, and has given
of his time and energy unstint-
ingly for the cause of Engineer-
ing Education for over 20 years.

garding the principles and ideas

neering.—The Editor.
ence and industry which followed the close of the
Civil War resulted in the rapid development of
highly specialized fields of engineering, and in a
consequent emphasis on specialization in engineer-
ing education. Whereas in 1870 a student could
choose his course from Civil, Mechanical, or Mining
Engineering, in 1926 he had "57 varieties" or more
for his choice. Little wonder that the curricula of
the engineering colleges had become congested and
chaotic.
Meanwhile, two new influ-
ences were gradually develop-
ing—t h e engineering profes-
sion, and the science of edu-
cation,—which served to check
this tendency to specialization.
Roth these influences made
themselves felt in a demand for
a fair and honest appraisal of
the situation, and an accurate
account of stock. An investi-
gation was undertaken concur-
rently from three different
points of view: the National
Industrial Conference Board
made its contribution by study-
ing the problem of the relation-
ship between Engineering Ed-
ucation and American Indus-
try: the professional societies, guarding, jealously
the professional spirit that shall prevent their work
from becoming a mere trade, have attempted to de-
fine the requirements for successful service to their
profession. These two bodies have done much to
clarify the understanding of what is wanted. Their
agreement is no coincidence. American industry
needs leaders; the profession of engineering needs
leaders. The call is for men,—men with initiative,
independence of judgment, personality, and power.
And in response to this clear definition of the de-
mand placed on the engineering colleges, the So-
ciety of the Promotion of Engineering Education,
financed by the Carnegie Foundation, has inspired
and directed the engineering colleges to study their
own case with a view to perfecting the means for
turning out the product that is called for. The re-
ports of all these research programs give evidence
of a reaction against the specialization which re-
sulted from the phenomenal industrial development
of this country.
The preliminary report of the Board of Investi-
gation, of the Society for the Promotion of Engi-
neering Education, is especially well worth study,
since it represents the co-operative effort of one
hundred and thirty-four engineering colleges to
make an accurate appraisal of the present situation
in Engineering Education. The conclusions set
forth in this report are based on the opinions of

THE COOLIDGE CATHODE RAY TUBE
Bv C. H. THOMAS
THE first work of bringing cathode rays out
through a window in the wall of the generat-
ing tube was done by I.enard about the time
that Roentgen discovered X-rays. The X-rav tube
has been perfected and is in general use while all
attempts to produce a serviceable cathode ray have
met with many difficulties. Various experimenters
have used one of two
general methods. The
first and earliest method
consisted of cementing
thin metal foil over met-
al into which holes have
been bored. This perfo-
rated metal served as the
window support. T h e
second method consisted
in perforating a s m a 1 1
hole in a diaphragm
through which the elec-
trons were accelerated.
The latter method was
extended to the use of
twelve diaphragms, each
with a small hole in it
arranged in a straight
line. The vacuum in this
system was maintained
by twelve mercury dif-
fusion pumps. In all this
work the currents were
very small.
It remained for Dr.
W. 1). Coolidge to de-
v elop the tube which
would permit the use of 350,(XX) volts and allow the
use of a current of at least 2 milliamperes.
Figure 2 shows a model of the Coolidge cathode
ray tube which we are using. Its over all length is
89 cm. and the diameter of its bulb is 30.5 cm. This
model may be operated safely up to 350,000 volts.
The cathode consists of a flat spiral of tungsten wire
placed in a hemispherical focusing cup, c.
The anode proper, a, which is at the same time
the window, consists of a sheet of nickel foil 0.0127
mm. thick and 7.5 cm. in diameter, supported against
the pressure of the atmosphere by a honeycomb
structure of molybdenum, b. The edge of the win-
dow is soldered to the invar ring, r, and this in turn
is sealed directly to the end of the glass anode arm,
at s by a metal to glass seal. The perfecting of
metal to glass seals of this large size has aided
m.iteriallv in the development of this tube.
A long tube, k, of thin copper, which is electrically
connccted to the window, serves as an electrostatic
shield to protect the glass of the anode arm from
puncturing. The edge of the end facing the cathode
is given a radius of 1.5 mm. to prevent cold dis-
charge during the half of the cycle when it is at a
high negative potential with respect to the cathode
structure. This copper tube is so designed as to
intercept none of the
primary cathode ray
beam.
This shield is very es-
sential to high voltage
operation as without it
full cathode potential
may build up on the in-
side of the glass anode
arm, even in the imme-
diate neighborhood o f
the anode, resulting in a
potential gradient which
will cause disruptive dis-
charge through t h c
glass.
As a result of the pres-
ence of the shield, very
few electrons can get to
the glass walls of the
tube for most of the elec-
trons constituting t h e
cathode ray stream go
right through the win-
dow, and of those reflect-
ed from the window and
the wind o w support
nearly all will go to the
shield and only a relatively small number can
emerge from the end of the shield facing the cathode
against the hostile field of the latter.
Since the functioning of the tube depends on the
special structure of the anode and cathode, each
will be described in some detail as follows:
The design of the cathode is important in that it
greatly affects the size of the cathode beam at the
point where the latter impinges on the window
(focal spot), and plays a dominating role in de-
termining the evenness of distribution of energy
over the focal area. The two factors, size of focal
spot and evenness of distribution of energy, are in
turn important as they determine the maximum
temperature of the window and so set a limit to the
amount of current which can be passed through
the tube.
It is desirable that all of the cathode ray beam
shall fall upon the window, as any portion of it

a photographic dark-room and placing it over an
opening in an illuminating box containing a power-
ful light source and then, with eyes in good con-
dition, going over it either with a low-power micro-
scope or with the naked eye. Generally the holes
can be detected in this manner, but some are so
small that they do not show except when under
vacuum. Many sheets are found free from holes
and where a hole is found it is closed with soft
solder.
The window support consists of a honeycomb
structure, b. Figure 1. It is made of molybdenum
0.015 cm. thick bent into hexagonal cells which are
fastened together and to the surrounding molyb-
denum frame by copper brazed in hydrogen. The
individual cells measure .o cm. between opposite
sides and are 0.47 cm. deep.
The shape of the openings in the window support
seems to be important if the maximum allowable
current is to be as high as possible. Experiment has
shown that with a molybdenum support having cir-
cular openings with a diameter 0.6 cm. (equal to the
distance between the opposite sides of the hexagons
in Figure 1) the window material would tear with
lube currents which could be safely borne when
using the molybdenum support with hexagonal
openings, and the space factor was more favorable
in thu latter than in the former. By calculation,
about 80 per cent of the window is free in the sense
of being directly exposed"to electron bombardment.
The window is attached to the invar frame by
soft solder. The most scrupulous care is necessary
to avoid the presence of dust particles between the
window and its honeycomb support, as very moder-
ate sized dust particles, if present, will often punc-
ture the window as soon as the vacuum is applied
to the tube.
Although the tube may be evacuated and sealed
off, we are using our tube connected by large bore
tubing through a mercury vapor trap to a single
stage umbrella type mercury diffusion pump in
series with a Langmuir condensation pump, which
has an oil pump for a fore vacuum.
All metal parts in the tube are vacuum fired be-
fore assembling, but still it is necessary to heat the
copper tube and window to a dull red by electron
bombardment before one may obtain a suitable
vacuum. The tube itself is carefully heated with
Bunsen burners to free the glass from occluded
gases. Then the metal parts are subjected to elec-
tron bombardment by imposing a strong magnetic
field on the electron beam.
Of the various sources of high potential possible
we are using alternating current through a high
potential transformer with a Tungar rectifier load
superimposed on the primary. Furthermore since
we must earth the anode, we must use an insulation
transformer. Figure 3 shows our present arrange-
ment. Two hundred and twenty volts, 60 cycle A.
C. is applied through a suitable resistance to the
terminals of a 1 to 2 transformer, the primary ter-
minals of which are connected to a Tungar rectifier
in order to reduce the inverse voltage on the tube
which rectifies its own current. The secondary ter-
minals of the 1 to 2 transformer are connected to
the primary terminals of a 1 to 1 insulation trans-
former which serves as a source of supply for the
high voltage transformer. The one primary lead to
the high potential transformer is connected to the
mid point of its secondary coil so that no point on
the transformer will be above 100,000 volts to earth.
Hence it is necessary to have the entire high poten-
tial transformer' insulated for 100,000 volts. The
1 to 2 transformer is used to enable a high resist-
ance which will limit the output to be used in the
primary.

BATIK
liv MYRON BITMAN CHAI'IN
IN MENTIONING the word "Batik" in any
heterogeneous gathering one still feels the ne-
cessity of a word of explanation, though there
has been more or less interest in the subject in the
United States for the last ten years. Batik here is
a revival of a very ancient art, practiced most ex-
tensively in Java, though the Egyptians and South-
eastern Asiatic ancient peoples in general have been
thought to have used it, or at least a process of a
very similar nature.
The history of batik is interesting to both the lay-
man and the artist. The art which had been prac-
ticed in Java for hundreds of years first aroused the
interest of Europeans through the efforts of the
Dutch traders who brought batiks to Holland about
the middle of the seventeenth century. The word
itself is Javanese, and means the process of obtain-
ing a design with dye or stain, using wax on the
material as a resist. As early as 1518 there was
already a flourishing industry of this order in Cheri-
bon, Java. It is thought to have been practiced by
small groups or1 communities as early as the twelfth
century. However, it was during the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries that this art reached its
height when most of the inhabitants of central Java
were engaged in this industry.
However, it is,with much (more interest that we
turn to the modern adaptations. The batiks taken
to Holland in 1750 did not rneet with public tyvor,
and no regular market was found for^he (Javanese
, , i' I
product. After the publication in 1K17 of "The His-
tory of Java" by Raffles, several Dutch artists
among whom were Chris LeBeau, Dijesselhof, and
Lion Cachet through their own productions revived
and stimulated a nation-wide appreciation of this
art. In fact, it became a fad or cult, and was intro-
duced into the schools. This did as much harm as
good as the people who were making batiks were
lacking in the fundamentals which give it value,
namely—a thorough training in design and color
and an appreciation of sound craftsmanship. This
same fault existed in some of the early work of
American students which has had much to do in
prejudicing the public against batik. There are still
people who think batik is a piece of sleazy silk with
a few daubs of pristine colors and much crackle pat-
tern in it, worn by some "arty" young woman, or
something thrown over a piano or divan to cover
their shabbiness. A real batik possesses much merit,
and some of the most prominent artists in this coun-
try are producing batiks of the same high standards
as their paintings. Such well-known names |as

in design and color, a steady hand and infinite pa-
tience. A batik cannot be "dashed off" hurriedly as
only those who have made them know. The Java-
nese use cotton almost exclusively, calico being the
most common material, although some native batik-
. &lt;TS produce designs on silk for foreign trade. The
native way of preparing
the material and produc-
ing a batik strikes the
American as a very com-
plicated process. They
consume days and often
weeks in boiling and
drying and preparing the
material, and then they
dye from dark to light,
necessitating the remov-
al of the wax and re wax-
ing for each color. The
American method is
much s h o r t e r as we
work from light to dark.
All material has to be
thoroughly cleansed be-
lore it is readv for wax-
ing. For silk this is but
a simple w ashing in
warm or cool water. To
prepare cotton is a more
lengthy process, as all
the starch or dressing
has to be removed by
boiling. The best results
are obtained when the
material is boiled for seven hours in rain water, the
water being changed every forty-five minutes. Cot-
ton for hangings as backgrounds for furniture or
sculpture is more satisfactory than silk, as the col-
ors are softer, and in consequence, it seems a more
suitable background material. All material is best
stretched and kept in a more or less horizontal po-
sition while one is working in wax. It should be
kept free from touching am surface, though work-
ing over oiled paper or glass will make the work
sufficiently easier to offset any disadvantage of that
method. Both paraffin and beeswax are used for
waxing. If the artist prefers to keep his design in-
tact with little or no "crackle" he will use beeswax,
though it is somewhat sticky and will drag on the
material if used clear. Some workers prefer to use
beeswax in the proportion of three to one with
paraffin, and then gradually add clear paraffin as
the mixture is used up.
THE BIRD OF TIME
as the latter is much
. cheaper than beeswax,
and it is less important
to guard against crackle
as the work nears com-
pletion, as there are less
dye-baths to deteriorate
the wax.
The wax is best heat-
ed by placing the recep-
tacle containing, it in hot
water, though not in the
manner of a double boil-
er, but with c n o u g h
space between the inner
and outer pans to allow
the worker to observe
the quantity of water as
it rapidly boils away
The room in which one
is working must be kept
w a r m a n d free from
draughts, as otherwise
the wax would chill and
only lay on the surface
of the material. It must
penetrate and sometimes
the additional warmth of an electric heater on the
floor will warm the goods to the right temperature.
The wax is applied with a sable or bristle brush, or
a "tjanting." a little instrument made for the pur-
pose, though the latter is not necessary except for
very fine work. After all the parts that are desired
white, or the original color of the material are cov-
ered with wax, it is readv for the first dye-bath.

REFRIGERA TION

THERE was a day—and that buried no great
way hack in the past of Michigan industries
—when the erection of a great manufacturing
plant was a matter of immediate and widespread
interest, irrespective of the article to he manufac-
tured or the advance in some particular phase of
industry which its production in quantity marked.
That day has gone; industry has gone forward with
such gigantic strides
that yesterday's wonder
has become the common-
place of today, and the
towering plant which
would have commanded
news paper broadsides
and a monopoly of pub-
lic interest a dozen years
ago now gets no more
than an obscure para-
giaph in the corner of an

public at large a casual,
"Ah, another factory of
some sort!"
Particularlv is this
true in Detroit and its
environs, where factories
whose working-day populations are those of gooc
sized towns rind whose products can only be ex-
pressed in terms of eight figures have sprung up
with such mushroom-like speed as to he a part 01
the accepted order.
Yet all the wonder is not gone. The motorist,
driving into Detroit by way of the new Plymouth
road, can hardly fail to note the vast size and archi-
tectural dignity of a great plant lying on his left
hand, some two miles west of the road's intersection
with Grand River Boulevard. The size of the build-
ing—640 by 440 feet—is remarkable, but there are
larger ones; the speed with which it has gone from
the stage of bare mud and surveyors' stakes to com-
pletion—between October of 1926 and March of the
present year—is impressive but not record-breaking.
But what does make it impressive is the fact that
this new plant of the Electric Refrigerator Corpo-
ration has been built to accommodate the expansion
of a business which had no existence twelve years
ago!
The history of the Kelvinator Corporation—out
THE NEW PLANT OF THE KELVINATOR CORPORATION
of which this new Electric Refrigeration Corpora-
tion has been created by its incorporation with the
Nizer Corporation and the Grand Rapids Refriger-
ator Company—provides an almost perfect example
of industrial chronicle. It has been a joint effort
between capital and science to meet a great human
need which has reached the point of a great and
permanent success after passing through lean and
discouraging years, until
it is now established as
one of the greatest in-
dustries of the State.
But the talc cannot
rightly begin with Au-
gust, 1914, w hen t h e
joint efforts of Mr. Ar-
nold H. Goss and Mr.
W. D. Merger marked
the initiation of the ef-
fort which was to culmi-
nate in the erection of
the vast plant on the
Plymouth road; it must
go many years further
back to p r o v i d e the
proper background.
The practice of corl
ing bodies below the temperature of the atmosphere
by the use of ice is almost as old as man's occu-
pation of those latitudes in which water froze. And
at a very early period of his development, man real-
ised he had not the same command of cold as of
heat, and his persistent ingenuity was soon turned
in this direction. Lord Bacon expressed man's con-
sciousness of this need when he wrote:
"Heat and cold are Nature's two hands whereby
she chiefly worketh, and heat we have in readiness
in respect of the fire, but for cold we must stay till
it cometh, or seek it in deep caves or high moun-
tains, and when all is done we cannot obtain it in
any great degree, for furnaces of fire are far hotter
than a summer's sun, but vaults and hills are not
much colder than winter's frost."
The next step, the commercial harvesting of na-
tural ice, was obvious and yet it came rather slowly.
Cooling by evaporation was known to the ancient
Egyptians and natives of India, and Marco Polo is
said to have brought hack recipes for water and
milk ices from Japan and China. But the actual

manufacture of ice is an accomplishment of modern
man.
Edwin F. Slosson, in his "Science Remaking
Everyday Life" says:
"The chronicle of the century of effort to ap-
proach the farthest north of temperature, absolute
zero, is as fascinating as the contemporary struggle
to reach the geographic pole and, unlike the latter,
THE AIR COMPRESSOR
has proved profitable at every stage. When Fahren-
heit in 1724 stuck his mercury thermometer into a
mixture of salt and snow he thought he had reached
the lowest possible point and boldly scratched '0'
on the .glass tube, but it was not long before scien-
tists began to climb down the minus steps. In 1769
a Russian professor, taking advantage of a cold
spell, froze mercury itself in a mixture of snow and
nitric acid."
More than a century ago Faraday, in his labora-
tory at the Royal Institute in London, succeeded in
condensing ammonia gas to a liquid by applying
pressure and then cooling it. When the pressure
was removed, the liquid naturally boiled off rapidly
as a gas, absorbing heat in doing so. This discovery
was not merely of great theoretical value, but it
had set the whole effort toward ice-making on the
right track. Almost a century before this, in 1755,
Dr. William Cullens had invented a machine which
made ice and produced refrigeration by reducing the
atmospheric pressure with an air-pump, causing in-
creased evaporation of the water, but it was not
until after Faraday's discovery that progress became
rapid and steady.
The first patent in the United States granted to
produce ice by mechanical means went to Dr. John
Gorrie of Appalachicola, Fla., in 1850 for a machine
which used compressed air to produce refrigeration,
but as early as 1834 an American engineer, Jacob
Perkins, had invented a machine using ether as a
refrigerant, this device being the true forerunner of
the modern compression machines and cycle, as it
consisted of an evaporator, expansion valve, com-
pressor and condenser.
Within the limits of a brief sketch it is quite out
of the question to follow the whole development of
mechanical refrigeration, the long series of experi-
ments with such devices as the Gorrie air-machine.
Kirk air-machine, open cycle air-machine. Allen
dense air-machine, low pressure air refrigeration
system, water vapor absorption machines, etc.
Years of experiment indicated that the vapor com-
pression machine was the most practical and the
type most certain to endure, which has been proved
by the fact that most of the mechanical refrigeration
today is performed by machines of this type.
In this form of refrigeration, liquids which can
be alternately liquefied and vaporized—ammonia,
sulphur dioxide, methyl chloride, ethyl chloride,
ether and carbon dioxide—are used. The refrigerat-
ing cycle is divided into four phases:
1. Vaporization process in cooling coils.
2. Compression of vapor in compressor.
3. Cooling and condensing of vapor in condenser.
4. Throttling effect through expansion valve.
Refrigeration is produced by the evaporation of
the liquid used, all of them having relatively low
boiling-points. The vapor is conducted to the suc-
tion side of the compressor. The compressor forces
the gas into the condensing element, where it is
liquefied. The liquid refrigerant is then allowed to
return to the cooling element through an expansion
valve, and the cycle is continuous.
The cooling element is operated on either a "dry"
or "flooded" system. In the latter, a relatively large
amount of the liquid is stored in the cooling ele-
ment and the level of the liquid in the cooling ele-
ment is regulated by means of a float-valve. In the
dry system the regulation of the rate of evaporation
of the refrigerant is controlled by an automatic ex-
pansion-valve operated by the low-side pressure.
During what may perhaps be called the second
period of mechanical refrigeration—when it had
gone beyond the experimental stage and become a
commercial certainty—household refrigeration by
mechanical means was a field still practically un-
touched. Mechanical refrigeration was confined to
manufacturing plants, hotels and similar places
where the installation and maintenance of large and
expensive refrigerating plants was practical; but
the housewife was still wholly at the mercy of the
muddy boots and uncertain hours of the ice-man.
With the enormous increase in the number of
scientific household machines such as the vacuum-
cleaner and the electric washing-machine, the prob-
lem of perfecting mechanical refrigerating devices
for the small private house was given more and
more attention. The first definite ventures in this


Page 15
THE MICHIGAN T E C H N I C
field followed the natural tendency—the household
machines were simply the big commercial units
made smaller. But these plants were by no means
successful. Even though reduced in size they were
still cumbersome, very expensive to install and to
operate, and by no means sufficiently "fool-proof"
to avoid giving a great deal of trouble after they
were in actual operation.
While the month of August, 1914, may, as already
stated, be considered the real beginning of the me-
chanical domestic refrigerator industry in Michigan,
it had been put an a commercial basis earlier in
other parts of the country.
As far as can be determined, the first machine was
sold in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1911. It was manufac-
tured in France, known as the Audiffern machine,
imported to this country and installed in a private
house.
Two years later, Mr. Wolf of Chicago brought
out an absorption type of machine for household
use, and later put on the market the "Isko" com-
pression type machine. The "Guardian" machine
appeared in 1914. Later it was taken over by the
General Motors Corporation, and renamed the
"Frigidaire" in 1918.
In August of 1914, Mr. OIoss and Mr. Mercer, con-
vinced that the problem of household mechanical
refrigeration was one which could be solved by sci-
entific investigation backed by liberal financial sup-
port, began the long series of experiments which
was to end in complete success. Mechanical refrig-
eration had been an accomplished fact since 1855.
and they believed that it would prove practicable to
manufacture efficiently and at a low cost a small
plant for domestic use which could be controlled
automatically.
Some of the first work was done with machines
of the absorption type, later tests were made with
compressed air, and finally a machine designed on
simpler lines, of the compressor type, using sulphur
dioxide as the refrigerant, was brought out. The
choice of sulphur dioxide followed a series of dis-
couraging experiments with ammonia, the virtues
of the chosen liquid being its low working pressures
and its non-poisonous, non-inflammable and non-
explosive qualities.
After repeated tests in the spring of 1916, a sul-
phur dioxide machine was completed which, while
not yet wholly free from defects, embodied all the
fundamental principles for an efficient, automatic-
ally controlled machine. It was called the Kelvin-
ator. after Lord Kelvin, the Scotch physicist. In the
early part of the following year, several machines
were installed in private residences, and were
watched very carefully for the appearance of any
defects.
It was found at once that the chief problem was
the leakage of gas along the crankshaft—and the
correction of this fault really forms the chief feature
of difference between the household refrigerator and
the large one used in the commercial plant. In the
latter, there is a leakage along the crankcase, which
is sealed only with a stuffing-box. Such leaks could
not be tolerated in a domestic machine, even though
sulphur dioxide had been substituted for ammonia
as a refrigerating liquid. The leakage was elimi-
nated through the use in place of the stuffing-box
of a bellows type of seal, having on one end of the
bellows a seal-ring pressed against the shoulder of
the crankshaft, the other end of the bellows flared,
gasketed and clamped to the crankcase cover.
The motor has been from the outset one of the
chief features on which there has been a constant
pressure for improvements—a pressure which is still
in force even though the motors of the present day
are better in every way than the earlier types. In
the Kclvinator. as in practically all machines, the
motor used is of the repulsion-induction type, owing
to the necessity of starting under a full load. In
the early days of the industry it was found that
these motors were by no means quiet in operation,
nor were they free from other defects, both me-
chanical and electrical. Much of the noise, both
electrical and mechanical, has been eliminated
through improved alignment of bearings and better
bearing fits, proper kind of thrust washers to cush-
ion the flotation noise between bearings, wool-
packed oil-wells instead of ring-oilers for lubrica-
tion, etc. Lubrication troubles have now been pretty

well eliminated. Where one lubricating formerly
lasted for a week, it is now sufficient for a year.
This has been accomplished by increasing the size
of the oil-wells and through the use of special wool-

show little variation from their early predecessors

in basic principles of design. The first machines
were equipped with poppet type discharge-valves,
which have been replaced in the later models by
disc-valves, each valve weighing about a fifth as
much as a ten-cent piece. The early machines had
no suction-valves, the gas entering through side-
ports in the cylinder walls. In the later machines
the suction-valve is located in the head of the pis-
ton, greatly increasing the pumping capacity. The
Hat leather belts used for the drive in the first ma-
'•hines, with idler-pulleys to take up play, have been
replaced by "v"-type rubber belts, which provide a
much more efficient transfer of power in addition
to being quieter and giving far longer wear.
The main features—in other machines as well as
the Kelvinator—have been continued without rad-
ical changes, although small refinements arid im-
provements are constantly being made. The con
densing element still consists of motor, compressor
and condensing-coils, the latter of copper tubing
one-half of an inch in diameter. In some of the later
machines, increased efficiency in the condensers is
being sought through the use of radiator instead of
coil types. This gives a lower discharge pressure
and secures a considerable reduction in size and
weight. The refrigerating element, placed in the
cooling compartment of the refrigerator, is, as in
the earlier types, a brine-tank in which are the ex-
pansion coils. And the automatic control is secured
through a thermostat instead of the less frequently
employed control system through the pressure of
the refrigerant itself.
During the last few years the tendency among
manufacturers has been to build the refrigerating
machines into boxes instead of marketing them sep-
arately for installation in boxes already built. Most
of the better known machines, such as the Kelvin-
ator, were originally, and for some years after being
put on the market, manufactured without the boxes.
The history of the industry has some distinctly
interesting features aside from the scientific and
mechanical development of the machines. The en-
gineering force of the pioneer manufacturers were
by no means the only ones compelled to work night
;md day during more than the early stages of the
campaign. The manufacturers were faced with an
immense task in educating the public to the ad-
vantages of mechanical refrigeration, precisely as
the makers of the first electrically operated wash-
ing-machines had been a few years earlier. In this
campaign of education, the manufacturers have dis-
played intelligence. There are something like 19,-
4(X).(.XX) refrigerators in use in the United States. It
was clear at the outset that the task of convincing
these nineteen millions of refrigerator users that
mechanical refrigeration possessed great advantages
over the natural method was beyond the powers and
resources of any one company. So there has been
in the selling methods and efforts of rival manu-
facturers a total absence of "cut-throat" tactics. A
widespread public confidence in mechanical refriger-
ation had to be erected and made solid; placing the
emphasis on a particular brand of refrigerator was
a step which could come later. Mr. A. might be-
lieve that his type of machine was superior to that
made by Mr. B., but he welcomed B.'s aggressive-
ne^s in the selling field, and he hoped that B.'s ma-
chine would not develop any discouraging defects,
because a lack of confidence in B.'s machine on the
part of the public became a skeptical attitude toward
all machines and so hurt A. just as much as it did B.
The results of this intelligent co-operation and
judiciously friendly rivalry have been precisely what
might be expected; the industry has been carried
through the uncertain, tentative period and placed
on a sound commercial basis in a much shorter time
than would have been possible had competition on
a vvar-to-the-knife principle been the rule from the
outset.
Half the battle for the manufacturers of electric
icfrigcrators has been the economical maintenance
of the machines already installed. When a man
buys a piece of machinery declared by the maker
to be automatic in its operation, he expects it to be
as good as the promise, and he is exceedingly im-
patient of trouble. And obviously the problem for
the designer and manufacturer of a piece of auto-
matic apparatus is indefinitely more difficult than
for the maker of a machine which operates only
under human guidance. The fashion in which serv-
ice troubles have been reduced is another distinct
achievement on the part of the industry. A few
figures on this point are instructive.
Until about 1925. the use of the flat belt and idler-
pulley caused a considerable amount of trouble.
With the substitution of the "v" belt and the elimi-
nation of the idler, service calls for this particular
trouble (in the experience of one manufacturer)
were reduced to less than one per machine per year.
Thermostat troubles were frequent up to about
1923. They were found to be due to the inherent
stiffness of the thermostat bellows, and they were
eliminated by a rigid inspection of the bellows and
the passing of only those tested to close limits well
within the pressure of the sulphur dioxide gas with
which they were charged. Expansion-valve trou-
bles, it was found, were due mainly to dirt under
the needle-valve and in the strainers, and were
largely done away with through the elimination of
dirt and scale from the tubing. Compressor troubles
were caused principally by moisture in the sulphur
dioxide. The cure here was effected by rigid inspeo
tion of the moisture content. Every drum of sulphui
dioxide received from the manufacturer was rigidh
tested for moisture content and by baking that
used in the construction of the machine.

damage may be done to tissue to produce more or
less lasting symptoms, or the victim may die
through bubbles in the heart or brain.
A diver may descend rapidly with no ill-effects
from pressure so long as he keeps his ears cleared
—that is, the same pressure inside the eardrum as
THE COMPRESSION CHAMBER IN WHICH TESTS ARE
MADE WITH HUMAN BEINGS EXPOSED TO HELIUM-
OXYGEN MIXTURE
outside—otherwise he is liable to severe pain if
not rupture or breaking of the membrane. A good
diver can descend to 190 feet in 2 to 3 minutes
without difficulty—in fact as rapidly as his ten-
ders can feed out his hose, life-line, and telephone
cable, which are usually bound together to form
a single line. On reaching the bottom or the work-
ing place, the men cease feeding him line except
to take in or play out line to meet the necessity
of his movements.
When ready to start back to the surface the
tenders haul in the line and lift the diver from the
bottom. Experienced divers can make themselves
light by increasing the pressure in their diving
dress, thereby making themselves more buoyant.
The ascent, however, is not usually a continuous
one. The decompression schedules are based on
stages of decompression or rests at various inter-
vals of depth—that is, the diver is hauled up a
certain distance and then stopped for a period to
allow the excess gas to escape from his body fluids
and tissues. The number of these stops increases
with the depth and period he was exposed to the
pressure at the bottom. In some cases a steel plat-
form is lowered over the side of the diving barge
to a point above where there is danger of en-
tanglement in wreckage, or obstructions on the
bottom, or free from the hose and life-lines of
other divers who mav be down at the same time.
When the diver who is undergoing decompression
reaches the platform on his way up, he crawls on
and he is hauled the "remainder of the way by a
winch or derrick, but stops are made at various
intervals as before.
When the diver finally is lifted from the water
he is undressed rapidly, sometimes given a stimu-
lant if cold, and always observed for the first signs
of bends. If these occur he is immediately placed
inside a specially designed steel chamber and re-
compressed to relieve the symptoms. If no steel
chamber, sometimes called by divers the "Iron
Doctor," is available the diver may be put down
into the water and thus go under pressure to re-
lieve the symptoms.
The precautions which must be taken to arrest
the occurrence of bends, or caisson illness, and the
time required to decompress or bring a diver back
to the surface after he has performed his work
have always been a major factor in the depth and
range of diving work. The deeper a man dives the
more excess nitrogen he will absorb; consequently,
it will take much longer to decompress safely and
bring him back to the surface. Likewise, tiie
longer he stays on the bottom at work the more
excess nitrogen he will absorb, which will also
increase the period of decompression. This decom-
pression time increases rapidly at depths below
100 feet and at 200 to 250 feet the time becomes
too long for practical work, even though the work-
ing period is reduced to 10 or 20 minutes. For
example: it would require several hours to de-
compress safely and bring back to the surface a
diver who has worked 15 to 20 minutes at a depth
of 250 feet.
This long period of decompression is fatiguing
to the divers and also may be dangerous to under-
take. Storms may arise which, because of the rise
and fall of the ship, would likewise jerk the diver
(as he virtually hangs on a rope on the side of
the vessel) up and down. This often causes nau-
sea, or injury, especially to his ears, through the
change in pressure at the up-and-down positions
which he rises and falls. The water may be very
cold and he may suffer from numbness and poor
circulation; something may go wrong with the div-
ing equipment; or he may become injured. All of
these make long decompression periods hazardous
and have indirectly limited the range and depth of
undersea work.
Nearly all investigators agree that the nitrogen
of the air breathed by the diver is the main cause
for the bubbles. Normal atmospheric air contains
approximately 79 per cent of nitrogen and 21 per
cent oxygen. There is a small amount of carbon

dioxide (0.03 per cent) and somc rare gases. but
these are apparently of no marked significance.
Rather recently the Bureau of Mines became in-
terested in pressure and caisson work and as a
result started investigative work at its Pittsburgh
experiment station. This work was initiated by
Dr. R. R. Savers, chief surgeon of the Bureau;
W. P. Yant, associate chemist, and Joe Hilde-
brand, professor of chemistry. University of Cali-
fornia. An attempt was made to develop a syn-
thetic atmosphere which would be more suitable
for divers than ordinary air. After a large num-
ber of experiments had been made on animals it
was found that by replacing the nitrogen of the
air with helium, and also reducing the oxygen con-
tent below that of normal air, an atmosphere could
be made that would permit decompression in one-
third to one-fourth the time required for air and
that also the deleterious effects from oxygen pois-
oning could be prevented.
The advantage of helium is that it is only about
half as soluble as nitrogen and thereby greatly
reduces the amount of excess gas that a man will
accumulate while under pressure, and that will
have to be given off in decompression. Also, be-
cause the helium molecule is smaller than nitro-
gen, it will diffuse more rapidly, and the escape of
the excess gas will be facilitated. The quantity
A DEEP SEA DIVER DESCENDING ON METAL STAGE
of oxygen is controlled within the amounts which
will not cause deleterious effects, yet be sufficient
for performing work. For very high pressure the
amount of oxygen in the synthetic air may be in-
sufficient to support life at ordinary atmospheric
pressure or low pressures, at which times it must
be enriched, but at the higher pressures it will
become adequate owing to the building up of the
partial pressure of that constituent.
Animals were subjected to pressures of 5(X)
pounds and decompressed with no apparent ill-
effects. A 500-pound pressure is equivalent to a
head or depth of about 1,200 feet of water, or
about four times that of the record dive in Pearl
Harbor made by U. S. Navy divers a number of
years ago. Divers often work at depths greater
than 150 feet but very few at 200 feet. The work
carried out on animals does not signify that men
will be able to go to those very high pressures be-
cause animals are more easily decompressed than
men, but it does signify that the depth may be
markedly increased and the period of decompres-
sion decreased. Animals similarly exposed to or-
dinary air could not stand the pressure and re-
quired a much longer period of decompression for
even lower pressures.
\\ith this information, the investigators con-
sulted with the Navy Department and a trial test
on men was arranged under the supervision of
Chief Gunner C. 1.. Tibbals, commander of the
U. S. Salvage Ship Falcon. Chief Gunner Tibbals
was the first man to use the synthetic atmosphere
under pressure. After a successful experiment, two
more of the crew volunteered for tests which were
also successful. As a result, a co-operative inves-
tigation was planned between the Navy Depart-
ment and the Bureau of Mines for conducting a
more thorough investigation of the advantages to
be gained by the use of synthetic atmospheres,
likewise, to work out favorable rates of decom-
pression and to make a study of caisson illness
with a view of devising ways and means of pre-
vention. Chief Gunner Tibbals and seven experi-
enced divers were detailed to the Pittsburgh ex-
periment station of the Bureau of Mines to work
in co-operation with Dr. R. R. Savers, chief sur-
geon, and \Y. P. Yant, associate chemist, of the
bureau. Dr. Charles K. Reinke, acting assistant
surgeon, I•. S. Public Health Service, was also
assigned to the medical phase of the work.
A rather extensive program has been started.
The experiments are conducted in a large pressure
chamber with men as subjects. This chamber or
room, the most modern of its kind, was built at
the U. S. Navy Yard at Norfolk, Va. It has elec-
tric lights, telephones, windows, fan, and adequate
control apparatus, all designed to stand a test pres-
sure of 1,000 pounds or MX) pounds working pres-
sure. The walls and doors are of steel approxi-
mately \}2 inches thick.

MOULDING RUBBER WITH ELECTRICITY
liy W. C. C;EER
MAN has long used rubber to keep electricity
where it belongs. Recently some research
chemists have been showing how to use
electricity to put rubber where man would like to
have it. Incidentally, much power-consuming, cum-
bersome equipment for forming certain kinds of
rubber goods to prepare them for vulcanization ap-
pears to be doomed to scrap-heaps and some dis-
agreeable work places will be transformed. Patient
scientific research, utilizing modern knowledge of
the way matter is put together, has again been
richly rewarded. As has occurred more than once,
independent workers almost simultaneously made
practically identical discoveries. Again research is
revolutionizing an art; rather, a new art is being
built which will in part supplant old methods and
in part create new satisfactions for human needs.
Better methods have long been sought for manu-
facturing rubber goods from the latex, or sap, of
rubber trees. Rubber is not soluble in water, but
latex and some other forms of pure and compound-
ed rubber can be suspended in water by dispersing
them into very minute globules. These "suspen-
sions" or "dispersions" for some purposes resemble
a solution, although in other respects quite differ-
ent. In water dispersions the globules of rubber
carry negative charges of electricity; consequently,
when a current is passed through them the minute
bits of rubber go to the positive pole, or anode.
Some searchers for new methods gave attention to
this knowledge.
In 1922, S. E. Sheppard and L. W. Eberlin, work-
ing in a laboratory of the Eastman Kodak Com-
pany, at Rochester, N. Y., and I'aul Klein, A.
Szegvari and a large staff in Budapest, Hungary,
found independently that pure and compounded
rubber could be electrolytically deposited from
water dispersions on to metal or ceramic molds, in
a way somewhat like electro-plating with metals.
The former group was trying to cover metals with
adhering coats of rubber deposited from water dis-
persions, and the latter to make rubber goods di-
rectly from latex.
Each investigator was practically interested in
improvement of the quality of rubber goods. They
knew that when the solid dried crude rubber is
worked upon a mixing mill in the rubber factory,
the rubber substance was altered, depolymerized,
as the chemist says, and thereby became softer and
weaker. They knew that the less rubber was heat-
rd or worked, the better was its quality. They also
knew that research of chemists in recent years had
shown how vulcanization may be carried on at
lower temperatures than formerly and the neces-
sary sulphur combined with rubber with minimum
of loss of quality. Certain substances known as ac-
celerators possess the property of permitting vul-
canization to be accomplished at relatively low
temperatures. However, if these accelerators were
incorporated on the usual mixing mill, the temper-
atures would be sufficiently high to cause vulcan-
ization during mixiiig and spoil the goods.
These men conceived the plan of so depositing
rubber on forms, from latex, that the rubber par-
ticle itself was not altered and made the astonish-
ing discovery that electro deposited rubber had the
highest quality ever observed. Many were the
problems to be solved before this was made prac-
tical. It was necessary to incorporate other sub-
stances to be deposited simultaneously on the
anode, such as sulphur, zinc oxide and carbon black.
These latter two substances are necessary in rubber
goods to give toughness. A long investigation was
carried out to find means to disperse them in water,
mixed with the latex particles, without coagulating
the latex. A noteworthy achievement, which has
made the Anode process possible, has been the
means by which these rubber layers may be free
from bubbles, for when an electric current is passed
through a solution, bubbles of gas are formed on
anode and cathode. So they hit upon the scheme of
surrounding the anode with a porous clay dia-
phragm. The anode is therefore immersed in elec-
trolyte inside a porous clay cell or dish and the rub-
ber particles together with those of zinc oxide,
sulphur, etc. are deposited upon this porous so-called
Anode diaphragm. Thus the rubber as it collects
forms a continuous, homogeneous, tough covering
of uniform thickness. Any thickness up to an inch
or more is practicable. Rubber thus formed is
stronger than rubber prepared by the old methods.
and is free from gas or air holes. Therefore it is
permissible to use less thickness for some purposes.
Industrial development is already well advanced.
Continuous, automatic production of certain kinds
of articles is feasible. Manufacture of inner tubes
for automobile tires is the most important applica-
tion, if quantity be the criterion. Bathing caps, sta-
tioner's elastic bands, tobacco pouches and hot-
water bottles are other examples. Insulation for
wires and other things electrical is another applica-
tion. After being formed of desired thickness, ar-

ONE of the chief functions of a great uni-
versity is to develop personality and char-
acter. Men and women entrust their sons
and daughters to its guidance not alone to be filled
with information but at the same time to be de-
veloped in honesty, forcefulness, courtesy, intelli-
gence, and industry. If the proper personality is
developed, knowledge will care for itself. Success
is a result of two parts personality plus one part
brains. I feel therefore no
hesitancy in talking about
some of the interesting phases
of our personalities. I am in-
deed delighted to have the op-
portunity to discuss this sub-
iect. This discussion will be
on that sort of personality
which every human being
would like to possess—a pleas-
ing personality. Any man or
woman who asserts that he
does not like to be liked by
other people is either a liar or
a freak. The highest ambition
of every man is to maintain
the respect of those whose opinion he values. We
all desire a personality that is pleaMng to some
other people.
But in developing a pleasing personality we have
to know first of those qualities which are pleasing
to other people. And here we run into a difficulty.
NYhat is pleasing to one acquaintance may not be
pleasing to another. In fact. I have taken the
trouble on many occasions to ask my friends to
define what kind of personality is pleasing to them.
They always differ in some respects: One lays
stress upon good looks, another upon a sense of
humor, a third upon keenness of mind. On the
other hand, there are a number of traits upon
which they agree.
From many sources I have gathered a few fun-
damental common qualities which seem to me to
be necessary in a pleasant personality. They com-
prise my li*t; vours may be different. Neverthe-
less, I think you will agree with me that mine is
a good one,
lust for fun I am going to &gt;tate these five quali-
ties as questions, which you may ask yourselves
IS YOUR PERSONALITY
PLEASING?
How well do you like people?
How much do you enjoy talk-
ing to other people about
what interests them, rather
than about what interests
you?
How much sense of humor
and fun do you have?
How much do you do for your
friends?
Are you a forceful, vigorous
person, or are you a dead one?
about yourselves. It v-,u are just about as good
as the average of your friends you may, in college
style, grade yourself C. If you think you are above
the average give yourself the grade of A or B,
and if below average mark yourself I) or E. Then,
when you are through, you may ask one of your
friends to judge you on these qualities and com-
pare your own opinion with his to see how closelv
you agree. Now we are all set for the self-analysis.
The first question I shall ask
is this: How well do you like
people?
If you are a critic and pick
holes in v o u r acquaintances
you cannot have a personality
pleasing to other people be-
cause no one is clever enough
to cover up his criticalness.
Other people know instinc-
tively if you are a critic and
are afraid of you. They do
not like to be criticized. But
if, on the other hand, you see
more good than you see faults
in other people; if you are in-
clined to excuse the faults and to think well of
.every one. you will, to that extent, be pleasing to
them because it is natural to like people who
like us.
What is your score on liking people? If you
wish to like people there is one simple method to
use. Make a list of the good points of some of
your acquaintances, and think about these points.
Do not let the criticisms creep into your mind.
Try it on one of your pet aversions for two weeks
and see how vour liking develops.
How much do you enjoy talking to other people
about what interests them, rather than about what
interests you?
If you always talk your line, you may be sure
that people will grow tired of hearing about it.
because what interests everybody most is their
own line. Wc like people who listen well and ask
intelligent questions. We like them to be good
talkers, but not monopolizers.
What is your score on giving other people a
chance to talk?
How much sense of humor and fun do you have?


May, 1927
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
If you do not have a sense of humor it is hard
for you to develop it; but you can develop an en-
joyment of fun. Only a few of us are witty and
humorous. We have to be born with it and we
cannot much increase the amount. The majority
of mir friends do not possess a keen sense of
humor; and indeed all that they want us to have
is an enjoyment of fun. Our jokes, our puns, and
our wit may be very crude and musty, but that
does not matter if we enjoy ourselves with our
friends and do our best to be cordially humorous.
That much we all can do.
I suppose every one will grade himself A on
sense of humor and fun. Only the most mournful
of my friends will acknowledge that they have no
sense of humor and, at that, they half suspect they
are mistaken.
What is your grade?
How much do you do for your friends?
Do you perform little acts of thoughtfulness?
Do you see that they have matches for their cigar-
ettes, that the chair is comfortable, that they get
the evening paper? Are you consciously thinking
of doing little courteous things for them that take
no time but nevertheless show that you are think-
ing about them? Particularly, do you laugh at the
right time when they need the laugh to make them
happy, and is the laugh a joyful chuckle or a
strained "Ha! Ha!"? I know that the man who
is thoughtful of me in little ways is inherently un-
selfish, and I like that kind of person. So do you!
In developing a pleasing personality, it is of
more importance to try to do little things for
people than great monumental things. It is some-
times better to remember to ask a friend about his.
family than to give him a thousand dollars.
Where do you grade yourself on courteous
thoughtfulness about the. little comforts of your
friends?
Arc you a forceful, vigorous person or are you
a dead one?
We like people who do things, who have con-
vincingness, who hold their own in an argument
without temper, whom we can depend upon to do
things for us. We do not like ineffective people,
without convictions, who speak slowly, dullv. and
monotonous!y; who will not argue, or if they do,
get mad; who can be depended upon for nothing.
How strong are your convictions? Do people
listen when you talk? Do your friends ask your
advice because they respect it?
What is your grade?
In closing may I repeat that a pleasing person-
ality can be developed, in part, by attention to
the following rules:
1. Like people; don't be a critic.
2. Let your friends do their fair share of the
talking.
3. Enjoy fun even if you can't be a wit.
4. Be courteously thoughtful of the little com-
forts of your friends.
5. Develop convictions and get action.

velop the student as a man of intelligence and re-
source, rather than to train him for a narrow spe-
cialty. Rut most notably, it demands a broader,
more fundamental, more liberal, and more human-
istic curriculum. It is agreed that there should be a
core of fundamental studies occupying two-thirds
of the course, leaving only one-third for specializa-
tion. It is also insisted that cultural or humanistic
studies be an integral and essential part of this core
of fundamentals. Approximately fifty-seven per
cent of the replies favor giving the Humanities this
recognition.
The subjects suggested as especially fitted to en-
rich the engineering curricula by their cultural con-
tent, are as follows:
Literature. History. Modern Languages, Psy-
chology. Economics. Philosophy. Political Science.
Art. Biology, and Geology.
it is interesting to note that in the list of non-
engineering subjects fundamental to all engineering
curricula, 95.5 per cent favor English Composition.
.73.5 per cent English Speech, 45.5 per cent English
Literature. This actually places English second to
Mathematics and Physics only, as an essential ele-
ment in the education of an engineer. The social
and economic content of the engineering curriculum
also receives a new emphasis. Gencral Economics.
Engineering Economics, Political Science, General
History, History of Political Institutions, and cog-
nate subjects, are suggested as valuable for this
purpose by a large number of the replies to the
questionnaire. The following sentences quoted from
the report indicate the point of view of those who
stress the importance of these subjects:
"There are two fairly distinct objectives to be
kept in view; the first is the understanding of social
institutions, and of the broad interplay of social
forces; it is essentially philosophic and lies mainly
within the educational office of the social scientist.
The second is the capacity to deal with specific eco-
nomic problems and social situations arising within

the rtalm of engineering, and this is a responsibility
of engineering educators."
"The development of greater social insight and a
larger sense of social responsibility should he a
definite objective of the engineering profession, if it
is to gain recognition for more than its technical
proficiency,"
"These considerations lend a high importance to
the social sciences as an essential part of engineer-
ing education. These subjects should he taught by
competent exponents, and primarilv for cultural
rather than for technical ends."
"Adequate and sustained emphasis should he
given to the bearings of engineering on the broader
problems of society, and to the social responsibilities
of the engineering profession. The aim should be to
indoctrinate the student with a sense of social ob-
ligation which will survive pre-occupation of tech-
nical detail in his early experience, and determine
his attitude in the more responsible years of his
maturity."
The report lays great emphasis on the progressive
sequence of the sciences and related engineering
subjects. It insists also, on a co-ordinated, progres-
sive sequence of cultural subject,—"a hand of hu-
manistic subjects extending throughout the cur-
riculum." Sixty per cent of the replies express the
belief that the cultural subjects should be required
throughout the four years. Many point out that
these subjects are apt to be of greater interest and
value to the student in the later years of his course,
than in his thoughtless freshman year.
One sentence in this report is especially signifi-
cant of the degree to which the humanistic idea has
come to penetrate the whole field of engineering ed-
ucation, the ideal of making a man fit to serve his
profession intelligently, and to live in his world with
satisfaction to himself and profit to others. It is
this:
"Given a proper choice of subiect matter and ac-
tivity, reinforced by the incentive of purpose, the
inspiration of professional ideals and the effect of a
professional objective in bringing the entire process
to a focus, the result of engineering education
should be a sound, general development, worthy to
he compared with the result of any other collegiate
program."
The increasing recognition of the value of the
"Humanities" in the education of young men for
the profession of engineering has met with a ready
response from the students themselves. Engineer-
ing students have for a long time felt that they were
being forced to prepare for specific tasks, when they
needed, somehow, to be given the intelligence, judg-
ment, resourcefulness, originality, initiative, which
would fit them to meet situations and solve problems
which no college faculty could possibly forecast.
They have been conscious, too, of their need
of the liberalizing effect of non-technical studies.
They have appreciated their need for interests out-
side their technical field, in order to balance the nar-
rowing effect of their professional work in the long
stretch of years before them.
Whatever revision or reorganization of the cur-
riculum shall result from this new emphasis on the
more professional ideal of educating men. rather
than training workmen, the students of engineering
will welcome the opportunity for a larger range of
choice in their studies,—this, in itself, a liberalizing
experience,—and will feel that at last they are to
have the richer and more stimulating educational
experience which they have long desired.
THE COOLIDGE TUBE
(Continued from page 9)
by the rheostats in the filament circuit. At 100 KY
a temperature of 132° C. was reached by the hottest
part of the window, with 0.7 ma., in five seconds;
at 200 KV the same temperature was reached with
0.6 ma., in five seconds; 340° C. was reached with
200KV and 1.3 ma. in ten seconds.
Inside the tube the cathode rays approach the
window in a conical beam. Some scattering in this
beam takes place in the window and then a great
deal more on the outside.
Some experimenting has been done with this tube
by its developers. A short summary of the results
are now given.
Of twenty-four diamonds subjected to 200,000
volt cathode rays all but two stones showed blue
fluorescence, one of these showed green and the
other yellow fluorescence. None of these showed
appreciable phosphorescence. Not one of the dia-
monds showed any color change.
Fused quartz showed a purple color which dis-
appeared completely on heating before a Bunsen
burner. On again raying the surface the purple col-
oration returns with perfect duplication of original
pattern.
By fracturing the disc and then raying the frag-
ments, it was shown.that the inhomogencity ex-
tended throughout the mass and is in no way con-
nected with grinding and polishing operations.
Ouartz crystals from several different sources
have been rayed and the only ones showing any
color change are those from Herkimer County, N.
Y., and these turned brown.
Calcitc crystals, upon being rayed, fluoresce
strongly in the orange and remain highly lumin-
ous f.ir several hours after raying. In addition to
this they may show bright bluish-white scintilla-
tions. These have been observed while the crystal
is undergoing bombardment and for as long as a
minute after raying. By slightly scratching the

rayed surface of the crystal with a sharp instrument
the scintillations may be induced for as long as an
hour after raying.
Scintillations have not been observed in calcite at
a temperature as high as 180° C. At liquid-air tem-
perature they take place more readily than at room
temperature.
Very few substances show scintillations at room
temperature but many substances consisting of min-
erals, gums, organic acids, sodium salts of organic
acids, alcohols, esters, other organic compounds and
a few inorganic compounds show scintillations at
liquid-air temperature.
The scintillations are electric discharges and arc
apparently to be observed in substances which, at
the temperature in question, are good insulators.
When glue is rayed it breaks down under the
bombardment and the gas forms bubbles as soon
as the material is softened by heat. The same thing
happens with gelatin, shellac, cane sugar, rochelle
salt crystals and celluloid.
Aqueous solutions of cane sugar, starch and gly-
cerine become acid to litmus on raying. Milk, upon
being rayed, quickly acquires a rancid flavor and
strong odor. Butter behaves in exactly the same
way. Certain bacteria were killed by exposure to
0.1 ma. at 90,000 volts for one second, at a distance
of 1 cm. from the window.
Fruit flies, upon being rayed for a fraction of a
second with 1 ma., at 150,000 volts at a distance of
\Y\ cm. from the window, instantly showed almost
complete collapse and in a few hours were dead.
Water snails, exposed for very short periods of time,
died either immediately or within a few days. Cock-
roaches seemed badly injured when rayed for a
quarter of a second and one was killed by being
rayed for one-half second.
When plant tissue was rayed, the exposed areas
were covered with white latex as though the cell
walls had been punctured or in some other way ren-
dered permeable. The color of the rayed portions
of the leaf gradually changed from green to brown
and within a week the rayed tissues throughout the
thickness of the leaf had dried up.
The effect of cathode rays on animal tissue was
found to be as marked as upon plant tissue. Small
areas on the surface of a rabbit's ear were exposed
to the rays. The effects produced varied from a
slight tanning of the skin to complete destruction
of the tissues throughout the entire thickness of the
ear depending on the time of exposure and the
amount of current used.
Acetylene gas when rave d sufficiently long
changed to a brownish yellow powder which has
been called cuprene, the chemical properties of
which have not been determined.
We shall study the polmerization of the hydro-
carbons when exposed to a given amount of raying.
Analysis of the products will be made by fractional
distillation and combustion.

be used in order to conduct work under practical
conditions.
During the course of the investigation the work
•has been twice temporarily discontinued to allow
the personnel to take part in outstanding diving
and salvaging operations. The first of these was
for inspection of the S. S. Lakeland, a vessel which
sank in about 200 feet of water a few years ago
in Lake Michigan, just outside the Sturgeon Bay
Canal. This assignment necessitated the inspection
of the inside of the vessel, a feat not heretofore
attempted on such an extensive scale. The work
was successfully carried out without injury to any
of the five divers.
The personnel engaged in the investigative work
at Pittsburgh had just returned from the inspec-
tion of the Lakeland when the U. S. S. S-51 was
rammed by the coastwise steamer City of Rome
and sunk off Newport, R. I. The entire diving
personnel was assigned to the salvage crew of the
U. S. S. Falcon, to aid in the recovery of the lost
vessel.
In the salvaging of the S-51. the helium atmos-
phere played an important role. At all times in
the decompression chamber there was a lull tank
of a synthetic atmosphere of helium and oxygen,
attached to a breathing apparatus. In case a diver
developed bends, or in case recompression after
the development of bends did not correct the con-
dition with satisfactory promptness, the subject
donned the breathing apparatus and inhaled the
synthetic helium atmosphere while under the pres-
sure. His nitrogen was then replaced by the he-
lium, and this gas, being so much more easily
eliminated, accelerated his recovery and often re-
moved the symptoms in surprisingly short periods,
as compared with the- normal atmospheric air.
Were it not for the high cost of helium, the pos-
sibilities of using a synthetic atmosphere of helium
and oxygen during the entire period divers are
under pressure would be almost unlimited. Instead
of an hour on the bottom at 135-foot depth, nearly
two hours could be spent, without any increase in
the period of decompression. This would permit
of much faster work without the constant inter-
ruptions incident to the changing of shifts. Or, on
the other hand, work might be carried on by a
diver for an hour at a depth of more than 20(1


T H H MICHIGAN T li C I I[N I C
feet. This would make possible the salvaging of
many wrecks which are not now considered prac-
ticable for salvage, on account of the enormous
period necessary to decompress workers who
might descend to the requisite depth.
Under present conditions, diving hazards have
been reduced to a minimum, for, granting the pres-
ence of a trained observer in charge of the per-
sonnel, the symptoms of caisson illness can be
recognized as soon as they develop, and. prompt
recompression, especially if the helium apparatus
is used, will in every case control the trouble;
after which it is merely a question of decompres-
sion at an adequately slow rate of speed.
Landsmen may not be generally aware ot' the
intense rivalry for possession of the signal bell of
a sunken craft which is customarily indulged in by
deep sea divers. In the case of the bell of the
S-51, a most unusual game of submarine hide-and-
seek was participated in by the divers engaged.
"It became a matter of personal pride with some
of us to keep the bell out of the way of the re-
mainder of the men," says Chief Torpedoman
Smith. "Today the bell would be in a given spot;
tomorrow some enterprising diver, happening upon
its hiding place, might stow it away in an entirely
new place, from which it might be salvaged by a
third party. As the original 'thief of the bell. 1
was often hard-pressed to keep one guess ahead of
the others in discovering new hiding places. The
day came when I deemed it wise to attempt to
bring the much-sought-after bell to the surface. I
had hidden it for two or three days prior to this
in the engine-room, a place frequented by few, but
these were mv most formidable competitors. The
'trail' was becoming decidedly hot; 1 knew that
soon someone would be sure to stumble upon the
treasure-trove and ruin my chances of being the
lucky man and, considering everything, 1 thought
it advisable to bring the 'loot' up before it should
he 're-stolen' from me.
"In deep-sea diving two divers usually work to-
gether on each given place of work. It so hap-
pened that one morning 1 was working with Kadie,
a veteran undersea man. We were engaged upon
a risky and ticklish bit of work in the engine-room
and, having completed the job in good time, were
about to give the signal to those above that we
were ready to ascend, when I thought that it was
probably the most propitious time for salvaging
the 'treasure.' Accordingly, I brought out the bell
from its hiding place and passed it up through the
engine-room hatch to the mystified Eadie, who
had not in the least grasped the significance of my
antics.
"With the bell once safely on the deck of the
submarine, I explained the situation to Eadie by
means of signs and he willingly fastened the heavy
bell to my diving belt. The fact that this pro-
cedure added considerably to my already cumber-
some costume troubled me not at all. This done,
both of us signalled to be taken up with our long-
desired loot, the ship's bell of the lost S-51." o

The Electric Refrigerator Corporation is the larg-
est Michigan firm engaged in the manufacture of
mechanical refrigerators, so that the history of its
development has been used throughout this short
sketch of the industry, but it is by no means the
only Michigan corporation engaged in this com-
paratively new field of industry. Among the others
are:
Rice Products Co., Detroit.
Universal Cooler Co., Detroit.
General Necessities Corporation, Detroit.
\Vhitehead Refrigerating Co., Detroit.
Copeland Products Co., Detroit.

Ward Electric Refrigerator Corp., Buchanan.
Belding Hall Electric Corp., Detroit.
This list does not, of course, include many firms
engaged in the manufacture of refrigerating boxes
in which mechanical refrigerating units of many
kinds may be installed.
Such a combination of courageous persistence in
the laboratory and the experimental workshop, the
unhesitating expenditure of money in the effort to
perfect an efficient machine and intelligent methods
in the educational and selling campaigns has not
only placed a new industry on a firm basis in a re-
markably short time, but it has put Michigan at the
verv head of the new field.

der dyes on the market. With the exception of
boiling, the directions of the manufacturer are safe
to follow. Silk should not be subjected to a high
temperature either in washing or in dyeing. A tem-
perature of dye comfortable for the bare hands is a
safe enough gauge, though the melting point of
beeswax is 140. The addition of paraffin lowers it
twenty degrees or more. Cotton with beeswax can
,be dyed in a bath of higher temperature. The vol-
ume of the dye-bath should be about fifty times the
weight of the material—"a pint's a pound," The
quantity of dye should be such to allow a twenty
or thirty minute bath, rather than a stronger so-
lution, and even if a dark value is desired, it is
thought best to add the dye gradually, as immediate
immersion in a strong dye-bath will cause streaking.
After the material has been stirred about in the
bath for twenty minutes or more take it from the
solution and rinse it thoroughly in clear water of the
same temperature. The color while wet, like water-
color, will look much darker than it will when dry.
Care must be taken not to wring or squeeze the
material which would destroy the waxed surfaces,
and it had better be patted nearly dry in an old
towel before hanging it up to complete the job. The
material should be hung up with pins, for if it came
in contact with any surface such as a clothesline,
the water would be absorbed more quickly at that
spot, and that would result in a streak at that place.
When the material is dry and warm enough for a
second waxing, again stretch it flat, and look care-
fullv for any breaks in the first waxing, and repair,
unless one is intentionally planning on much
crackle. In repairing a break in the wax, do not
pile the wax on either side of a crack, which would
only result in another break in the next dip.
Naturally, one has to go from light to dark, as a
light value cannot be obtained over one already
dark. As complements mortify or neutralize each
other, one cannot have complementary colors of
equal intensity or value, for as the value deepens
the chroma is correspondingly reduced. One may
get a design in one waxing, such as black on white,
or one can get any number of colors by repeated
waxings and dyeings. Colors are sometimes
bleached if it is not desirable to preserve a whole
area. Any process of this kind either with am-
monia or any patent stripping compound deterior-
ates the wax, and the result is bound to be a much
broken and crackled design. Commercial workers
sometimes resort to painting in some of their col-
ors, but—like a painted Oriental rug, such colors are
fugitive.
. When the last color has been obtained, the time
has arrived to remove the wax. In the case of vel-
vet, or any heavy material, it is better to send it to
a professional cleaner, though with most materials
one may do it at home with gasoline. This process
is safer if done out of doors, but even there care
must be exercised in not rubbing the material
enough to cause sufficient friction for ignition. All
of the wax possible should be removed in the first
bath, and then a second rinsing in clear gasoline will
keep the material from having a stiff, paper-like
quality. Silk hangings are usually backed with a
cotton lining which is weighted. Cotton hangings
require nothing more than weights, or a heavy hem
at the bottom.
Batik hangings, or silk murals as they are some-
times called, are much in vogue at present. With

There is a tendency to use fewer and larger deco-
rative elements in the interiors of the present, and
batiks in their adaptability both as to color an'1
scale supply this need admirably. They can be
stored conveniently, quickly cleaned, and what is
more,—easily shipped, making a duplication of deco-
ration in country home and city apartment unneces-
sary. There are batiks, simple but attractive, that
one may buy for a modest sum. Some New York
artists receive a thousand dollars and more for their
larger hangmgs. They can be had to fit the scale,

That steam may outdistance water power for
generating electricity even in the Pacific Coast
country where water power is so abundant is in-
dicated by recent developments in that region. The
cheapness of oil fuel and the great advantages in
efficiency of steam generating machinery are the
main reasons for this condition. Although only
one-third of the electric energy used in California
today is generated by steam, engineers believe that
this ratio will soon be reversed.
Most of the hydro power sites have been or are
at the present being developed. The best hydro
plants today are developing from 85 per cent to 90
per cent of their theoretical efficiencies, which
leaves but little chance for improvement. Also sev-
eral years of comparatively drv weather have
placed greater emphasis on the value of steam
plants.

has been said there is every indication that this
will in time be true.— Journal of the A. I. E.. E.

Honlogeneou* Lcml Cnnting for
Lead coating by a process which eliminates the
use of soft solder or tin, as a flux to effect the ad-
hesion of the lead to the metal being coated, has
been developed by the Gross Lead Burning and
Coating Corp., Cleveland. This is being used for
applying coatings of lead to steel, brass and copper
containers for holding corrosive acids.
In place of the usual solder flux, a liquid lead Ilux
is used, made from a formula developed by Louis
dross after 20 years of research and experimental
work. The success of the Gross formula is at-
tributed to the avoidance in the flux of tin or other
materials readily attacked by acids or which prevent
the coating from withstanding heat.
Pieces to be lead coated, which are small enough
to be dipped in a tank, are first cleaned by pickling
in diluted sulphuric acid and then rinsed in clear
water. They are then immersed in,a pure lead bath.
The flux floats on the top of the molten lead, to a
depth of one-half inch, depending on the character
of the work being coated. As the piece is dipped
into the bath it is completely covered with the flux,
which opens the pores of the metallic surface. The
piece is left in the bath a few minutes, until a skin
base about the thickness of writing paper is formed.
Cpon this amalgamated basis successive coatings of
lead are built up with the ordinary lead burning
process, by means of a burning bar and oxy-hydro-
gen torch. When finished, a homogeneous coating
is provided of one-eighth to three sixteenths of an
inch in thickness, according to requirements.
Articles too large to he immersed in lead baths
for skin coating are first cleaned with emery wheels
or by sand blasting. The piece is then preheated
with a torch, a small section at a time. If its form
permits, the heat is applied the side opposite that
being coated, allowing the heat to penetrate clear
through. When the metal is brought to about 700°
Fahr., the solution is applied and the skin of lead
is put on with a burning bar. After the base is ap-
plied in this way, the lead burning bar is used for
adding successive coats to form a homogeneous
coating.
One important advantage claimed for this process
is that the coating will stand the temperature of
molten lead before loosening, and. in fact, will melt
before it loosens. The melting temperature of the
coating is given as o50-670° Fahr. or 50° higher
than sheet lead. Ordinary solder when used to cause
adhesion to the part being coated, it is pointed out.
melts at a low temperature and the coating gives
way. It is claimed that the coating applied by the
Gross process will not peel, buckle, crack or blister,
and that heat expansion and contraction have no
effect upon it. Sheets coated by the process it is
stated, can be crimped, beaded, or rolled after coat-
ing, without damage to the coating.
The process is being applied for coating pickling
tanks in the sheet steel industry, to take the place of
wood or steel tanks lined with sheets of lead. A lead
coated steel shipping drum also has been developed,
which successfully withstood standard shipping
tests. The process has been applied in coating
aluminum but as yet has not proved commercial)v
satisfactory. Coated copper roofing plates are re-
garded as more satisfactory than those having a
galvanized coating.—The Iron Age.

is also endless interest and utility. In fact, the
American public is paying more than a million dol-
lars a week for glass-contained vacua.
Ability to create even partial vacua in enclosed
spaces has been of great use. It has made possible
suction pumps, thermometers, incandescent lamps
and many improved physical and chemical pro-
cesses, and has increased the efficiency of steam en-
gines and turbines.
At night we sec largely by the aid of vacuum
lamps. By means of other vacuum lamps (X-ray

sion of photographs by wire or wireless, incorpo-

Smokestacks' Doom Keen in Xew Type
Factory Building
Smokestacks are going the way of the wooden In-
dians who used to embellish cigar stores, as witness
the record set up by wide-awake Cincinnati.
Local citizens have no aversion to seeing "red" in
baseball parlance, but they certainly do not intend
to see black—the black of belching smoke and soot,
for example. Already several factory buildings have
been completed in Cincinnati that do not have
stacks, and it is expected that four more will be
completed this summer, according to Alvin M. Fork-
IHT. of the Union Gas &amp; Efectric Company of that
city.
The newest of these stackless, smokeless factory
buildings was recently erected by a building com-
pany. The elimination of the stacks was made pos-
sible by the brother utility services, gas and elec-
tricity. The former furnishes the heat, while the
latter furnishes the power and light.
Offering the new factories as evidence, Mr. Fork-
ner claims that stacks pouring forth large volumes
of smoke may have symbolized industrial activity
in the past, but the present interprets them as a
menace.
"One of the specifications called for by the build-
ing company was the utilization of all available floor
space," says Mr. Forkner. "Fuel storage space is
eliminated by using gas heat. The principal features
of the system are that it requires no attention, is
flexible in operation, and may be cut down or turned
on full force at will. The svstem is a unit one, the
units operating independently of each other. They
can either be attached to the wall or suspended from
the ceiling without any loss of efficiency."—Gas

V a riou* Unas of the Photoeleetric Ceil
The value of the photoelectric cell as a detector
of light has now been utilized in several photo
metric instruments. These applications were de-
scribed by Dr. Clayton H. Sharp at the Montreal
meeting of the American Physical Society.
For use as a photometer to maintain a photo-
metric balance the cell is placed behind a rotating
glass disk one half of which is silvered so that the
rays of the "X" lamp and the comparison lamp are
thrown alternately on the cell. The cathode sur-
face of the cell is connected to the grid of an ampli-
fying tube and the output of the amplifier, after
passing through a transformer and a rectifving de-
vice, is measured by a D. C. galvanometer. Any
difference in the effect of the two lamps upon thi
cell will be shown by the galvanometer.
For use in spectrometry the filament of an incan-
descent lamp is focused on a spectrometer slit, the
beam passing through a variable sector. The pho-
toelectric cell with an amplifier is the detector. A
circuit is used such that the galvanometer shows
only changes in plate current. Spectrophotometrk-
measurements of transmission are made by noting
the deflection of the galvanometer when the filter
is imposed in the beam, and then, by means of the
sector, bringing the galvanometer to the same de-
fiection when the filter has been removed.
The photoelectric cell is also used f., determine
the temperature of lamps. The cell shows that the
latio of light transmitted by a blue filter to that
transmitted by an amber filter varies with the tern
perature of the source of light. The temperature
of incandescent bodies can thereby be determined,
using a calibration curve.

Xi Lecture
"Aeronautics As a Means of World Transporta-
tion" was the subject of a talk given by Dr. W. F.
Gerhardt, T7E. under the auspices of Sigma Xi,
March 29, in Natural Science Auditorium.
Dr. Gerhardt was one of the first aeronautical
students to graduate from the University and re-
ceived his Doctor of Science degree several years
ago. Before taking office in his present capacity as
Vice-President of the Aeronautical Research Cor-
poration of Detroit, Dr. Gerhardt was stationed at
McCook Field, where he was in charge of the engi-
neering division of the research department. Dr.
Gerhardt is considered as one of the foremost au-
thorities on performance analysis and free flight
tests, having written numerous papers and books on
aerodynamical problems, several of which are now
being used as textbooks.
In his address, Dr. Gerhardt pictured the family
airplane of the future as one being able to take off
and land on a person's own property, having a stop-
ping power comparative to the present-day automo-
bile, having a minimum number of moving external
parts and being able to effect a tangential landing
with a dead motor.
Dr. Gerhardt explained that in connection with
family airplanes that the helicopeter type of plane
promises to solve most of the present difficulties
encountered by aeronautical engineers in developing
a highly safe machine.
"Furthermore," declared the speaker, "the entire
future of aeronautics depends on the research which
is done in the next five years."
Discussing the heavy transport type of plane, Dr.
Gerhardt pointed out that the multiple engine planes
are far superior to other types for this work. Ac-
cording to statistics, a forced landing in the present-
day mail service is only necessary once in every
seventy trips of 200 miles each. Working on this
basis, Dr. Gerhardt showed that with different com-
binations of multiple engined planes that even this
safety could be improved.


May. 1927
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
"However, the multiple engined plane is only a
temporary solution of the problem since the ideal
plane is one with a single power unit. Therefore,
present-day motors must be developed to a relia-
bility of seventy times their present state in order
that a single powered plane can attain the safety of
a two-engined plane which is capable of flying with
one engine," stated Or. (ierhardt.
In concluding Dr. Gerhardt said that within two
years he expected to see airplanes that could rise
vertically in the air, and that within three years he
expects a plane to be developed which will fly across
the ocean and back without stopping, all the while
having perfect control, stability and performance.

Mr. A. II. d'Areambal. '12E. of Hartford. Conn.,
was the speaker of the evening at the last meeting
of the American Society of Chemical Engineers, on
Thursday evening. April 21, in the society rooms
in the East Engineering Building, lie took as his
topic the subject, "Metallurgical Controls in a Plant
Manufacturing Small Tools, (iauges, and Aircraft
Motors."
During the talk, the extreme necessity of accu-
rate metallurgical control was particularly empha-
si/.ed. The manufacture of high grade gauges, and
high-speed cutting tools was explained and also il-
lustrated by lantern slides of operations in the
Pratt and Whitney Company factories at Hartford,
Conn., where Mr. d'Areambal is Chief Metallurgist.
He also told of the aircraft motor which is built b\
this company. It is a nine-cylinder, air-cooled,
static radial type motor, with an acceleration from
idling speed of 400 revolutions per minute to 100 )

revolutions per minute in one-tenth second. After
the talk, there was considerable discussion on heat
treatment of high-speed steel, and Mr. d'Arcambal
explained in terms of the most advanced theory the
phenomena which takes place in high-speed steel.
After the meeting, Madhusudan Mozumdar, '28

Control Through Will Power." Mr. Mozumdar.
who comes from India to study chemical engineer-
ing, has, by constant exercise and right living, de-

Receipt of an appropriation of $10,(XX) from the
American Gas Association for a program of inten-
sive research in the use of gas for steel treating at
the University of Michigan has been announced by
Prof. A. E. White, head of the department of engi-
neering research.
A specialist in metallurgy and a stall of labora-
tory assistants will immediately start a series of
investigations into the uses of gas for heat treating
of steel and in forging furnaces. The work, which
will be undertaken in co-operation with the Surface
Combustion Company, will be under direction of
Professors A. H. White and A. E. White.
Use of manufactured gas for heating operations
is constantly increasing because of the readiness
with which gas lends itself to automatic control.
While this work is being done for the American
gas industry, the results will probably be of great
direct value to Michigan industries. This will he
particularly true of the automobile industry, be-
cause of the immense amount of heat-treated metal
employed in it,
"This appropriation is taken from our special
fund of $5(K).(KK) to be used in a five-year program
of research in the field of large scale industrial use
of gas," Alexander Forward, managing director of
the American Gas Association, said in a telegram
to the engineering research department.
"We are especially happy to include the Uni-
versity of Michigan in this program and we are con-
fident that the work to be carried on there will
further reflect its high standing as an educational
institution. I extend to Prof. White and his asso-
ciates my congratulations on the termination of an
agreement which will bring, his institution in closer
contact with the entire manufactured gas industry."
Factors considered by the gas association in se-
lecting Michigan for this work are:
Excellent facilities are available in the labora-
tories of the University for the pursuit of this
study.
The University is almost in the center of the steel-
treating industry—a large percentage of the work
of this character in the United States being done
in factories located within a radius of 50 miles of
Detroit.
Prof. A. E. White is past president of the Ameri-
can Society for Steel Treating, and for 20 years has
devoted a major portion of his time to metallurgical
problems. During the war he was head of the Met-
allurgical department of the Inspection Division of
the United States Army Ordnance Department.
Prof. A. H. White has had contact with the Michi-
gan Gas Association for more than 20 years, and
has an intimate knowledge of the gas industry.
The Surface Combustion Company is conducting
a number of research problems looking to a wider
use of gas in industry, according to Prof. White.
and the American Institute of Making is studying
applications for gas in the baking industry.

The student branch of the A. I. E. E. held a meet-
ing in Natural Science Auditorium. Monday after-
noon, March 21, at which time R. R. Swain, grad..
gave a talk on "Radio Frequency Measurements."
A small model was used in illustrating the proper-
ties of high frequency electric flow on wires.
Monday evening, a smoker was held at the Union
for the Electrical Engineering students and was also
sponsored by the A. I. E. E. Mr. Deller of the Bell
Telephone Company's Research Laboratories of
New York presented an illustrated talk on various
phases of the telephone business. Former Brigadier
General R. I. Rees also addressed the meeting.

In commenting upon the various functions of the
Mechanical Engineering Department, Prof. H. C.
Anderson states that the new five-year combined
course in Mechanical and Industrial Engineering
shows every indication of being a decided success.
He is glad to say that at the present time the de-
mand for graduating Mechanical Engineers is over
four times the available number of graduating
students.
Prof. Anderson also stated that he has calls for
experienced Mechanical Engineers, and suggests
that any graduate who is desirous of changing his
present position would do well to communicate with
him for details.

Architect's May Party
The final plans and arrangements for the six-
teenth annual Architect's May Party, which will be
held May 6 at the University of Michigan, are
rapidly being completed, according to the various
members of the committee in charge of the party.
Winstead's Orchestra from Louisville, Ky., will
be brought north to furnish music as well as en-
tertainment for the evening to the two hundred
and seventy-five couples who are fortunate enough
to be able to attend the party. This orchestra was
well received when it made a previous appearance
on the campus.
The May Party, which is given annually by the
students of the College of Architecture, is becom-
ing the most exclusive party on the campus, due
to its limited ticket sale. It is the only costume
party given in Ann Arbor and it is well known that
it has the most elaborate decorative scheme of any
party given in the entire State of Michigan because
of the talent available in the school. The entire
work of design and execution of design being done
by the students.
The party is attended not only by the students
of the Architectural College, but also by the group
of students representative of the really talented ele-
ment on the campus. It is also interesting to know
that all those attending must be in costume; no one
being admitted in formal or street clothes.
In an effort to find the best possible scheme for
the decorations a competition was held among the
students, which was won by R. T. Bittinger, '27 A
of Ann Arbor, Mich. The winning design is a direct
effort to turn back the pages of life and allow all
those who would to romp and be merry, dance and
be entertained among the toadstool houses, snails
and flowers of a fantastic fairy land where elves,
goblins and fairy queens were wont to roam and
reign supreme.
The plans of the winning design place the set-
ting in a very elaborate garden, whose large scale
in relation to the human form will make one feel
very small and elve-like; a feeling of enchantment,
when dancing around the flowers and toadstools,
mushrooms and pendant spiders.
Entrance to the party will be gained through a
secret passage in an old stump whose sides are
covered with colored fungii and among whose roots
are brightly colored toadstools.
The ceiling will be covered with vari-hued crepe
paper over which will be strung many streamers
to give the effect of a very large cobweb. Lights
will also be placed above the web, all of which will
give the dancers the impression of dancing under a
huge cobweb and underneath the flowers among
which all these large spiders and snails are lurking.
The lights placed in banks around the sides of the
gymnasium will cast a faint glow upon the danc-
ing couples after being reflected from the highly
painted and brightly colored panels which will en-
circle the gymnasium.
It might be interesting to know that almost a
mile and a half of erepe paper are used in the cov-
ering and complete concealing of all the structural
work in the gymnasium.

\ joint meeting of the Ann Arbor Branch of A.
S. M. E. with the Detroit Branch was held May 7
at Ann Arbor. The purpose of the meeting was to
enable students to become more closely acquainted
with practicing engineers. Dinner was held at the
Union at 6:30 p. m., after which a meeting was held
in the new Physics Building at 8 p. m.
Mr. Floyd Firestone, Associate Investigator of
the Department of Engineering Research, gave a
talk describing and demonstrating various devices
for detecting and measuring noises and vibrations
in roller bearings and gears.
This was the first joint meeting of the Detroit
and Ann Arbor branches of the A. S. M. E., which
has been held here this year. It was considered
very much of a success by the attending engineers.

Prof. Sadler will leave in June for Glasgow. Scot-
land, where he is to receive an honorary LL,D. de-
gree from the University of Glasgow.

The frontispiece of this issue is the work of Mrs.
Mary O. Johnson, '27, Instructor in Freehand
Drawing in the College of Architecture. Mrs. John-
son's work has been featured in several of the Art
Exhibits in Alumni Memorial Hall, and she has
very kindly allowed us to use this charcoal sketch
of the new Architecture Building, done in such an
unusually brilliant manner, and one of her latest
sketches. This view of the Architecture Building
is doubly valuable, since it was drawn while the
building was in process of construction.
Remarkable for the effect of beauty produced
from the treatment of one of the streets in the
downtown district of "Detroit, the Dynamic City,"
the cover design is reproduced from the original

Echoes from the Graduates
FRANK C WAGNER
FRANK C. WAGNER, the subject of our bi-
ography, is the President of Rose Polytechnic
Institute and one of the most prominent en-
gineers in this country today. We are indeed for-
tunate to have the privilege and agreeable task of
outlining briefly the principal events in the life of
a man of his standing. His services to this country
and to the engineering world are-
invaluable. Mr. Wagner was
born in Ann Arbor in 1864 of
German-American parentage on
both sides. His father, William
Wagner, came here from Ger-
many in 1838, carrying all his
possessions in a small bundle.
Settling in Washtenaw County,
it was not long before William
became one of the most promi-
nent business men in this sec-
tion and he established an ex-
ample of sobriety and Christian
character which is one of the
most cherished inheritances of
his children. From his grand-
mother, a person of remarkably
strong character and intellectual
ability, Frank inherited many of
his prominent traits. She is re-
ported as having been extraor-
dinarily gifted in mathematics.
Before graduating from high
school, as his mind naturally inclined towards me-
chanics, Mr. Wagner was fully determined to be-
come an engineer.
At the age of eleven he entered Ann Arbor High
School from which he graduated with honors at the
end of four years. It was during his high school
career that he became interested in the work of the
church of which he has been a consistent member
since 1879. He was actively interested in the work
of the Christian Endeavor Society and the Students'
Christian Association. In 1888 he assisted in found-
ing a Y. M. C. A. among the American residents of
the City of Mexico.
In 1880 he entered the University of Michigan
DR. FRANK C. WAGNER
from which he graduated with the degree of A.M.
in 1884, at the age of nineteen. For the Master's de-
gree he chose for his major subject electricity and
for his minors chemistry and analytical mechanics,
his thesis being devoted to "The Electro-Magnetic
Theory of Light." The next year found him teach-
ing in the University as "Assistant in Physics" to
Prof. Charles K. Wcad, to
whose instruction in applied
mathematics he feels he owes
much of his success. During this
year also he received his degree
of B.S. (M.E.), his theses being
on the subject, "Some Electric
Light Tests," devoted to care-
fully conducted tests of the Van
Depoels arc and of the Edison
incandescent lighting plants at
that time (1885) in operation in
this city.
Some knowledge of the prac-
tical part of his profession was
gained at the Industrial Works
in Bay City. Sweeping floors
constituted his first step at the
bottom of the ladder. Mr. Wag-
ner's first real job in his own line
was with the Thomson-Houston
Electric C o m p a n y at Lynn,
Mass. Once started on his prac-
tical career success followed suc-
cess and he soon found himself entrusted by his
company with the responsible work of erecting and
installing electric plants. Several plants were erect-
ed, during the installation of which many difficult
obstncles were met and successfully overcome.
Directly from this last success orders were re-
ceived to go to Mexico as engineer in charge of all
the Thomson-Houston Company's interests in that
territory. Lighting plants were successfully in-
stalled in the Hotel Iturbide in the City of Mexico,
a private palace of the emperors before the time of
Maximilian, and at Pueblo. The latter was a plant
of 100 arc lights operated from water-power
seven miles out of the city. Several minor plants


May, 1927
T H U. M I C H I G A N T E C H N I C
were installed in cotton factories and numerous esti-
mates for new plants prepared, some of which have
been erected since. A report was also submitted on
the feasibility of an electric railway in the City of
Mexico.
While engaged on this work Mr. Wagner began
experiments on an electric meter which were so
promising as to lead him to resign his position so
that he might come home the better to pursue his
investigations. A year was spent in this work which,
owing to patent complications then had to be aban-
doned. Incidentally, however, the work led to the
invention of a successful volt meter.
In 1887 Mr. Wagner presented a paper before the
American Association for Advancement of Science,
of which he is a member, on "Analysis of Dynamo
Design." This paper, published later in the "Elec-
trical World." is remarkable as being the first work
done of its kind in this country.
In 1890-92 Mr. Wagner was appointed Acting As-
sistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering in the
University of Michigan. This position was changed
to Assistant Professor the following year.
It was at this time, in 1892, that he married Miss
.Mabel I'eck. of Ann Arbor.
During his connection with the University, Mr.
Wagner, in conjunction with Dean Cooley and the
late John K. Allen, made very elaborate tests of the
Nordberg pumping engine belonging to the city of
(irand Rapids, Mich. These tests were worked up
in great detail and presented at the 1900 meeting of
the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.
Another piece of testing work which had great
influence upon his subsequent career was a series of
tests upon the Stirling water tube boiler, then lo-
cated in the engineering laboratory of the Uni-
versity. These tests were made at the instance of
Dean Cooley to prove certain points at issue in liti-
gation over the fundamental Stirling patent. The
giving of testimony regarding these tests introduced
Mr. Wagner to the art of giving expert testimony of
an engineering character before the courts. His
services have been in demand in this direction quite
frcquentlv and in a number of very important cases.
In 1890, 1'rof. Wagner left the University of
Michigan to become Associate Professor of Steam
and Electrical Engineering at Rose Polytechnic In-
stitute, where he has remained ever since. In 1904
his title was changed to that of Professor of Steam
and Electrical Engineering and in 1920 to Professor
of Mechanical Engineering.
In 1923 Mr. Wagner was elected President of
Rose Polytechnic Institute and at that time the in-
stitute conferred upon him the honorary degree of
Doctor of Science.
While engaged in teaching. Mr. Wagner has con-
tinuously occupied his spare time with professional
work on the outside. In conjunction with Mr. W.
C. Ely of Terrc Haute, he designed the first of the
rotary puddling furnaces for the use of the Highland
Iron and Steel Company. This furnace was notable
for being controlled entirely by electric motors, both
for rotating the furnace, and for opening and clos-
ing the door for introduction and releasing of the
charge. Several of these furnaces have been in con-
tinuous use for a number of years.
In 191o. Mr. Wagner made the first scientific tests
of the so-called pipeless furnace. The results of
these tests were used in a hotly contested litigation
over the patent rights to this type of furnace.
Many of the interesting research problems upon
which Mr. Wagner has worked arose out of patent
litigation. One in particular, relating to the oper-
ation of an open hearth furnace used to heat skelp
for making butt-weld pipe, led to tests upon the
rate of heat transfer from the furnace to metal. The
results of these tests, in which it was shown that
in commercial furnaces heat was transferred accord-
ing to the Stefan law of the difference of the fourth
powers of the absolute temperatures, were given in
a paper which was published in the Transactions of
the American Society of Mechanical Engineers for
the year 1905. In this paper attention was called to
the great increase in heat-transmission in boilers
which might be obtained by raising furnace temper-
atures, and exposing the heating surface to radiant
heat at high temperatures. The developments in
boiler furnaces since that time have fully borne out
the predictions made in this paper. One of the lead-
ing boiler designers of this country characterized
the paper as "of unusual significance." It directed
the attention of this engineer to the advantages of
high furnace temperatures and has indirectly in-
fluenced developments along these lines.
The most important litigation from the stand-
point of the financial interests involved in which
Prof. Wagner has engaged related to a cracking
still for producing gasoline from gas oil. In con-
junction with Dr. W. K. Rittman, well-known ex-
pert in the petroleum industry, he spent nearly three
years in experimental investigations of oil cracking.
During the war Prof. Wagner was appointed En-
gineer for Indiana of the United States Fuel Ad-
ministration. He did his bit as one of the dollar-a-
year men in the service of his country.
President Wagner has five children living: Helen
W. (Mrs. J. L. McCloud), residing in Dearborn.
Mich.; F. Caspar, Jr.. of Victoria. Tex.: Priscilla M.
(Mrs. Fred H. Johnson), of Indianapolis, Ind.: Wil-
lys P., of New York City, and Harbara. of Terre
Haute. Ind.
Dr. Wagner is a member of the American So-
ciety of Mechanical Engineers, fellow of the Ameri-
can Association for the Advancement of Science,
associate member of the American Institute of Elec-
trical Engineers, member of the Indiana Engineer-
ing Society and a member of the Society for the
Promotion of Engineering Education.

Perfected Aerial Camera Hax Great
Cominei'fial Value
Aerial photography will be greatly aided by a new
automatic aerial camera which has recently been
perfected. This camera will enable the pilot of a
plane to map on one roll of film an area of 180
s(|uare miles at an altitude of 15,000 feet. The cam-
era records automatically the time the picture is
taken, the level condition of the camera, the alti-
tude, the number of exposures and the focal length
of the lens. A strip of land 90 miles long and 2 miles
wide can also be automatically registered allowing
50 per cent overlap.
This camera is placed in the rear cockpit of an ob-
servation plane. The observer can change the film
magazine in three seconds, installing an extra one
which will cover double the area without gaps. The
extent of area covered is governed by the number
of spare magazines taken on flight.
Aerial photography, previously used only for mili-
tary purposes, is now being utilized commercially.
Aerial photography has proved invaluable to town;--
or cities anxious to revise their tax assessments on
property. Through this medium many houses or
stores, previously not on the tax records, have been
discovered. By the increase in tax receipts which
has resulted from this discovery these towns have
been able to substantially reduce their tax rate. In
Middlctown, Conn., alone, 1,896 buildings were dis-
covered upon which taxes had not been previously
paid.
The aerial camera will also be of great assistance
to the surveyor who often is hampered in his work
by natural obstructions. Engineers, for example,
who are seeking to run a railroad line through a
mountainous region can use aerial photography to
great advantage.
Aerial photography can be used very successfully
by real estate dealers, by advertisers, and in all in-
dustries where a comprehensive view of physical
resources will aid in selling the product.
This new camera has been built by the Fairchild
Aerial Camera Corporation of Xew York.—Aviation

THE ENGINEER AND His RELATION To
COMMUNITY LIFE
llv PROFESSOR WILLIAM C. HOAD
A DISCERNING observer of our present-day
civilization not long ago remarked that engi-
neering education has been engaged in setting
up in place of the older educa-
tional ideal of personal culture
the more constructive standard
of beneficial service to man-
kind. This increasing purpose
in the formal preparation of
candidates for the engineering
profession is but the sign and
the index of an enlarging rela-
tionship between the activities
of the engineer and the public
welfare. More and more the
engineer finds his work to be
invested with a public interest.
More and more he is called
upon to aid in the solution of
public problems.
There is no field in which the
professional work of the engi-
neer is so obviously bound up
with the public welfare as city
building, city operation, and
city maintenance and improve-
ment. The fundamental plan-
PROF. WILLIAM C. HOAD
of its industry and trade are more strictly engineer-
ing activities. The great urban utilities of water
supply, transportation, sewerage, and lighting are
so fundamental that no city of
any consequence would be built
without them, or if built could
long endure; and the planning,
building, and ceaseless improv-
ing of these works are well
within the recognized province
of the engineer.
But the cities of the present
day are coming to demand
in u c li m o re of the engineer
than the planning and building
of public works and public util-
ities. All these things must be
managed, and the directive ad-
ministration of large and com-
plex public works which inti-
mately touch the lives of great
numbers of people calls for
broad human understanding as
well as technical abilities of
high order. Life in the city to-
day has become vastly more
complicated than life in the
ning of the cities themselves, or the revamping and small town. In addition to water supply, transpor-
rcplanning of cities which have grown up without tation, sewerage, and lighting, which may still be
intelligent guidance, is generally recognized as be- looked upon as the fundamental public services in
ing essentially an engineering function. The design-
ing and constructing of those public works which
are necessary for the safety and comfort and conven-
ience of the city's inhabitants and for the promotion
any city, there have come into view a long train of
minor, though highly important, problems which
affect the comfort and convenience and pleasure, the
financial income and outgo, and sometimes even the

health and safety of city dwellers. The restriction of
industry and trade through zoning; the drafting and
enforcement of building codes and housing regula-
tions ; the regulation and control of the use of streets
and other public ways; street cleaning and general
sanitation; the production and public distribution of
power; specialized fire protection; the solution of
rapid transit and of traffic control problems; the col-
lection and disposal of garbage and other city
wastes; the regulation of
smoke and other aerial nuis-
ances; all these, and a thousand
other things not dreamt of in
the philosophy of an earlier
day, must be given place on the
general municipal program,
and must be so planned and
managed as to be held in proper
balance. The wise and effective
administration of all these
things calls more loudly every
year for those qualities of train-
ing and habits of mind which
presumably are a part of the
engineer's mental equipment.
Not only are increasing respon-
sibilities being laid upon the
office of the city engineer, but
superintendents and managers
of public water supplies, commissioners of public
works, commissioners of park systems and of city
planning, directors of public service, managers and
superintendents of rapid transit, managers and di-
rectors of public utilities of all kinds, and other like
officials are more and more drawn from the ranks
of engineering. It has not come about merely by
accident that an overwhelming proportion of suc-
cessful city managers themselves are engineers.
And the end is not yet in sight. The most note-
worthy fact about our present mode of living is the
rapid change that is taking place in it. The vastly
increased use of the means of individual transpor-
tation afforded by the automobile and improved
highways is having a profound and far-reaching
effect, and no one can as yet pretend to say what
the ultimate result will be. The disaster that has
come in large degree upon agricultural industries,
while manufacturing has flourished, is another out-
standing aspect of present-dny change. The drift
of population from the country to the city, and the
growth of the larger cities at the expense of the
smaller ones, is a change which is in operation all
over the country. The releasing of vast and still
vaster quantities of power from natural storehouses,
and the use of this power in the manufacture and
distribution of labor-saving, comfort-yielding, pleas-
ure-giving devices and services, and on a scale of
lavishness never before imagined, represent other
IN view of the increasing stress
on the non-technical side of En-
gineering education it is the pur-
pose of this article and of others to
follow to bring out as far as pos-
sible the real background for this
trend of the profession. William C.
Hoad, professor of municipal and
sanitary engineering in the College
of Engineering, has done much by
way of studying the engineer's per-
sonal and professional relation to
his community. We believe that
Prof. Hoad through his personal
interest in the subject has voiced
the opinion of the most advanced
thinkers on this subject.
—The Editor.
phases of this change. The general economic shift
from higher to lower levels in money values is still
another aspect of the change that is going on; or
perhaps this last is but the net result and index of
all the other factors stated in monetary terms.
With much of this the engineer has had a good
deal to do, and he can scarcely evade his share of
responsibility for the results. He has stimulated
manufacture and has devised and developed meth-
ods of quantity production
which have multiplied manu-
factured goods almost without
limit, and oftentimes faster
than we could learn how to use
them beneficially. Comforts
and conveniences have been
added to human life beyond
our ability to enjoy them with-
out enervation. Labor-saving
devices have created leisure
that never existed before, but
we still have to learn how to
employ all this leisure in our
own best interest. There are
large rewards awaiting the en-
gineer who can clearly point
the way to the largest and
most profitable use of all these
good things which he has cre-
ated. But to do this will require an understanding
of men and their ways and the things by which men
live at least equal to his understanding of physical
materials and processes and the principles of eco-
nomic production. He must know something of
social as well as of industrial economics.
Notwithstanding its many recognized and some-
times spectacular successes, the engineering pro-
fesson has not always measured up to the oppor-
tunities presented to it. It is proper, therefore, to
call attention to at least one special qualification
necessary for the successful occupation of the pub-
lic service field.
It has been oftentimes remarked that science is
the sure foundation upon which engineering is
based, and that engineering is only science put to
use in the service of mankind. In its earlier stages
the sciences most drawn upon were the mathe-
matical sciences, and the application of these suf-
ficed for the rather narrow field in which engineer-
ing was supposed to operate. But engineering
quickly outgrew those earlier boundaries, espe-
cially as the developing physical sciences afforded
more extensive systems of organized facts and prin-
ciples from which practical applications could be
made. The production of power, the mechanization
of our daily life, the development and utilization of
the known natural resources and the never ceasing

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN ELECTRIC DRIVES
FOR ROLLING MILLS
By L. A. UMANSKY
THE iron and steel industry is the largest
single consumer of electric power. In 1924
this industry used more than 6,000,0(X),000
kw-hr., which is about 20 per cent of the total power
consumed by all industries in the United States. It
is of interest to note that the combined output of
all central stations in the country equalled 54,-
413,403,000 k\v-hr. during the same year.
A modern steel plant starting with iron ore as
erations and processes now in wide use, are prac-
tically impossible without the agency of electric
power. Rolling mill designers have taken advant-
age of the possibilities of electric drives and have
built mills on radically new principles, exception-
ally advantageous for steel plants, but not practical,
were it not for the presence of electrical motors.
On the other hand, the electrical engineers have
developed new machines, or new combinations of
a raw product, produces at its blast and open hearth machines, primarily, if not exclusively, for rolling
furnaces and at the coke
ovens a large amount of
waste gas or heat. Elec-
tricity gives means of con-
veniently converting and
transmitting this poten-
tial power to the centers
of its consumption. This
explains the rapid growth
of power generating
plants in steel mills; one
steel plant has an installed
capacity of over 100,000
kw. In 1926 alone the steel
industry purchased for its
use a 30,000-kw. turbo
generator and three others each rated at 20,000 kw..
not counting many other units of 15,000-kw. ca-
pacity and less.
• So great is the demand for power in the steel in-
dustry that even plants having their own blast
furnaces often purchase additional power from pub-
lic utilities. Many other plants, deprived of the use
of blast furnace gas, run almost exclusively on pur-
chased power. The latter amounted in 1924 to 39
per cent of the total power consumed.
The bulk of this vast amount of energy goes for
the work of shaping the steel; the rolling mill drives
are the principal outlets of the generated power.
Here the electric drive predominates. Hardly any
new mills are being equipped with anything but
electric motors; older steam driven mills are being
gradually electrified, for purely economic reasons.
Many electrical engineers, not connected directly
with the steel industry, may not fully realize the
profound, almost revolutionary changes which the
electric drive brought about in the rolling mills. It
is not merely the question of performing the oper-
ations in a better, more efficient, or more reliable
manner than otherwise possible; but the point,
which is sometimes lost sight of, is that many op-

mill application. Thus
the new rolling mill has
become closely tied to its
drive and is unthinkable
without it; the influence
between the electrical and
mechanical equipments is
now not only great—it is
also mutual. Many new
problems were brought
up and were solved more
or less successfully.
There will be outlined
in this paper, in a neces-
sarily short space, those
solutions offered by elec-
trical engineers for a few of these problems. A brief
sketch of the types of new rolling mills will give
the necessary background.
Continuous Rolling and Continuous Mills
It has been generally recognized that for a large
tonnage output a continuous rolling mill possesses
decided advantages. Such a mill, see Fig. 1, consists
of a number of two-high stands, arranged in tandem
and conventionally driven through a line shaft and
gears by a single motor or engine. The hot bloom
or bar passes in succession through all stands, as
indicated by the arrow. Each pair of rolls reduces
the cross-section of the bar until the latter leaves
the last stand as a finished product of the desired
shape. The layout is compact; little heat is lost be-
tween stands; the metal is rolled at a high temper-
ature and with a relatively low power consumption;
the steel requires little, if any, handling; the labor
costs per ton are reduced to a minimum.
The bulk of the country's steel output passes
through a continuous mill of one kind or another.
To maintain the high tonnages and to keep the
cost of handling clown, the rolled bars are usually
of considerable length; a finished length of several
hundred feet is quite common. In order to save the

floor space the stands are located close to each
other. This means that the metal is in several
stands at the same time. It is obvious that with
such an arrangement the speed of each consecutive
pair of rolls is increased in proportion to the reduc-
tion of the cross-section area. For a given mill the
speed relation between stands is fixed and is de-
termined by ratio of the several gears; hence the
reductions per pass, or the so-called drafts, are also
FIG. 1. ELEMENTARY DIAGRAM OF A CONTINUOUS
MILL WITH A SINGLE DRIVE.
more or less fixed. Thus, a continuous mill of the
outlined type, capable of producing large tonnages
of certain class of sections, is not quite flexible when
it comes to rolling of a diversified line of products.
Individual drives for several stands of a continu-
ous mill give it the necessary flexibility, at the same
time maintaining its inherent advantages.
Mills, designed and built on this principle, are
springing up all over the country. Hot strip, rods,
merchant and certain structural shapes are being
rolled on such mills. They are believed to be eco-
nomical, flexible and tonnage producing. In many
cases one mill of this type takes the place of two
or three less modern mills.
Such layouts would be hardly feasible were it not
for the application of the electric motor. We are
usually accepting it as a matter of fact, and are apt
to forget that there is no other device which can
concentrate a large bulk of power in a limited space,
which is eflicient even in small units and which is
capable of speed adjustment, yet will closely main-
tain its speed, once it has been adjusted.
It is outside the scope of the present paper and
outside the competence of the writer to offer a thor-
ough analysis of mill layouts from the standpoint of
rolling mill operations. It was not intended to con-
vey the idea that, for instance, a continuous mill
with individual drives is the best combination 01
layout for all applications; such a mill was merely
discussed in order to illustrate the profound influ-
ence of electricity on rolling mill engineering and
practice.
Types of Electric Drives
It will be shown presently how the electrical en-
gineers are providing suitable drives for mills of the
kind just described. While no radically new ma-
chine was invented nor introduced, some new com-
binations of machines were conceived and were suc-
cessfully applied.
D-c. Drives. When a mill requires a number of
adjustable speed drives it is the simplest and, in
many cases, the best way to make each drive a d-c.
motor and to furnish power to them from motor-
generator sets or from synchronous converters.
Fig. 2 gives the schematic layout of the motor
room of one of the most modern mills of this type.
A 3000-h. p., 200/3(&gt;0-rev. per min. motor drives
the roughing train of three stands; two 1700-h. p.,
90/204-rev. per min. motors and two 2100-h. p.,
150/460-rev. per min. motors are individually driv-
ing the next four stands; the two finishing stands
are each driven by double-unit, 2000-h. p. motors,
consisting of two 1000-h. p. armatures which can be
connected either in series or in multiple, and oper-
ating up to 800 rev. per min. Three smaller edging
roll stands are also electrically driven.
All motors are 600-volt, d-c. machines and the
power to them is furnished from three large syn-
chronous motor-generator sets, aggregating 12,200
kw. (40 deg. cent, continuous capacity). Practically
each motor has a corresponding generator, as is
shown on the diagram. Ward-Leonard control is
used for starting, and the combination of generator
voltage and motor field control gives a very wide
speed range (as wide as 4:1 and 5:1) to each drive.
D-c. Versus A-c. Drives. When a mill requires
a number of adjustable speed drives, especially of
the average or of less than the average capacity,
then it is usually more economical to make them
of the d-c. type, as just described. When a speed
range larger than 2:1 is necessary, the use of direct
current becomes almost imperative. The speed reg-
ulating control is quite simple, usually consisting
of one or several field rheostats. The use of direct
current may also reduce the cost of the high volt-
age switching equipment.
On the other hand, the necessity of converting
the full amount of electrical power three times from
the available a-c. line to the mill coupling, greatly
reduces the over-all efficiency of the drive and in-

creases the running light losses. Assuming an ef-
ficiency of a d-c. motor at 92 per cent and that of a
motor-generator set at 88 per cent, the over-all ef-
ficiency of the drive at full load is only 81 per cent.
When the d-c. machines are operating at reduced
voltage (i. e., when part of the speed range is cov-
ered by Ward-Leonard control) their efficiency


Page 9
THE MICHIGAN T E C H N I C
goes down quite appreciably. The actual over-all
efficiency and the power consumption (in terms of
kilowatt-hours used per ton of rolled material) are
still further unfavorably affected by the fact that
the average mill load is usually much less than the
rating of the drives.
Thus, much as a straight d-c. system may seem
attractive, in many cases, from the operating stand-
point, it would be fallacy to consider it as standard
for any multi-drive mill.
\Vith alternating current universally adopted in
all steel mills for power generation and distribution.
the engineers should always analyze whether the
available a-c. power could not be more directly used
for driving the mills. When large amounts of en-
ergy and large tonnages arc involved, the possible
improvement of 5 or 6 per cent or more, in over-all
efficiency, presents an attractive goal worth striv-
ing for. Say, a mill rolls 50,000 tons of steel per
month, consuming approximately 40 kw-hr. per ton,
or 2,000,000 kw-hr. per month; a saving of 5 per
cent at, say, 0.9 cents per kw-hr. will net over $10,-
000 per year. Such economy alone would justify an
additional investment as high as $50,000 if it were
required. But, if it is obtainable without any ad-
ditional outlay, or even with a lower first cost than
with a d-c. drive, then the application of a-c. drives
becomes vital and their possibilities should be most
carefully studied.
A-c. Drives. The art of engineering thus far
knows of but one way to build adjustable speed a-c.
drives, of such capacities as are involved in steel
mill work. This is to use a slip-ring induction motor
and to regulate its speed by acting on its secondary
circuit in one or another well known manner. These
methods are generally quite well known to elec-
trical engineers, and the most representative of
them are diagramatically shown on Fig. 3.
Broadly speaking, all these methods have one
thing in common. An induction motor, running at
a subsynchronous speed, delivers at its shaft, as me-
chanical energy, only that portion of the power
transmitted to the rotor which is proportional to the
speed; the balance of this power, proportional to
the slip, is available at the slip-rings and is usually
called the slip energy; it is of a frequency and volt-
age proportional to the slip. This energy is either
converted into mechanical power and is returned to
the main motor shaft, see 3B, 3D, 3F, or is con-
verted into electric power of the line frequency and
voltage and is returned to the a-c. system; see Figs.
3A, 3C, 3E. In the first case the drive is of a "con-
stant horse power" type, as approximately the same
amount of power (neglecting conversion losses) is
available at the motor coupling at all operating
speeds; in other words, larger torque is available at
the reduced speed. In the second case the drive is
of "constant torque" type, i. e., the power available
at the coupling varies in proportion to the speed.
Figs. 3A and 3B represent the Scherbius system
employing an a-c. polyphase commutator motor R
to convert the slip energy into mechanical power
at its shaft; then it is either returned electrically to
the line through an induction or synchronous gen-
erator K, or is utilized directly on the drive shaft.

The regulating machine R is shunt wound and is

In the Kraemer system the slip energy is con-

converter. This d-c. power (of variable voltage)
may be also either pumped back to the line through
a motor-generator set D-K, Fig. 3C, or returned
mechanically to the main motor shaft. In either
case the speed of the drive is adjusted by control-

DRY POINT ETCHING AND THE APPRECIATION
OF PRINTS
Iiv HERBERT WATTS
AMONG all the arts there is hut one which has
been fortunate enough to obtain strong and
lasting public favor; that is the art of paint-
ing. Most persons in their desire for the beautiful
are satisfied when they can recall to their mental
vision the masterly works of Titian, Rembrandt, or
some other of the magical can-
vasses which are left from all
ages to delight our eyes. There
is another branch of art, which,
like painting, uses the same ex-
pedient of story telling, and
this is the art of Black and
White. Since it is by far the
most widely read, its chances
should be the best of all the
arts. In spite of this, however,
it is just the one form of art
about w h i c h the least is
known.
The object of this article is
to describe one phase of the
Black and White art, known
as dry-point etching, and, if
possible, to convey some of the
subtle points necessary for the
appreciation of prints. Thus
anyone who will trouble him-
self to gain the information, by
study and close observation of
old and new masters, will find that in addition to
the aesthetic enjoyment he has derived, he has been
awakened to many new interests which will hence-
forth insure his partiality for this form of art.
In the most limited sense an etching is a drawing
or inscription, scratched upon a metal plate, such
that when rubbed over with ink an impression may
be taken from it en paper. There are two general
methods of line etching; first, that in which a
"ground" of wax is used and the drawing scratched
through is attacked with an acid; second, the dry-
point in which the work is done directly upon the
plate. The steel needle or diamond-point is used,
in the latter, with which the etcher goes over the
plate, laying out his design. If the object sketched
is unsymmetrical the actual drawing done on the
copper must be in reverse so that the impression
taken on the paper will be correct. This is not con-
sidered an artistic necessity, especially if the scene
is from nature. By holding the needle perpendicu-
larly a V-shaped furrow is cut into the metal, and
AN ITALIAN COURTYARD
if held at an angle a large ridge is produced like
that of a ploughshare. This ridge is called the
"burr," and it constitutes the distinctive feature of
a dry-point work. An eye, only partially trained,
can tell the difference between a line made in this
manner, and the more severe line produced by the
biting of the acid. Durer seems
to have been the pioneer in the
application of the true burr
quality, although it was gener-
ally used to supplement the
acid etching. Rembrandt ac-
quired a marvelous command
over this technique, and raised
it to the position of a separate
art.
When the plate is inked for
printing, the ink clings to the
burr and produces a magnifi-
cent, rich, and deep soft shade,
the quality of which no other
method of engraving can equal.
The dry-point process is
quite difficult, for there is no
means of steadying the hand
while it works on the plate, and
there is always the danger of
the needle slipping away, espe-
cially when a curved or com-
plicated line is attempted. Dry-
points require a most extraordinary degree of care
in printing, for in the press, and especially in the
hands of the printer while he is inking the plate, the
burr suffers rapidly. It is a very slight elevation of
copper at best, and as a rule, only one or two dozen
prints can be taken before it is worn off. Later im-
pressions have a flat lifeless appearance, and are but
skeletons compared with the earlier proofs. The
dry-point obtains its rich effect by brushing the ink
up against the burr; therefore, as a general rule, the
proofs obtained are somewhat different. Delicate
shades of sky and water, rich sweeps of shadow,
are thus produced by leaving a slight film of ink
over portions of the plate. The illustration on the
frontispiece was treated in this manner, and is in
direct contrast to "The Banks of the Ganges,"
which is a pure line etching, hand wiped and printed
with almost no tone. This artificial lighting is often
employed to concentrate and emphasize the com-
position of a picture. The art of etching is greatly

CHEMISTRY IN THE DESERT
By JOHN E. TEEPLE
THIS is a tale of how a sickly "war baby" be-
came a lusty chemical industry. It took much
scientific nursing and plenty of rich milk.
Fundamental research, skillful engineering, sound
business economics and loyal co-operation of chem-
ists, engineers and business men would have won
anywhere. The moral would have been the same
if the substances under study had been metals or
oils, instead of salts. Wartime necessity and situ-
ation in the Mohave Desert, not many miles from
Death Valley, in the southern part of California, add
romantic interest.
Potash is essential to agriculture and is useful in
many other ways. Continental U. S. A. consumes
each year about 250.000 tons of K2O, as the chemist
labels it with his symbols, of which over 90 per cent
goes on to the land. Before the World War, this
country produced only an infinitesimal quantity.
War cut off our supply from Germany. There are
a number of sources from which potash can be got-
ten in these United States if cost is not a consider-
ation. War exigency multiplied the price. More
than 120 plants were created to produce potash in
various ways in several parts of the country. Two
of them were at Searles Lake, in the Mohave Des-
ert. In 1918, production from 123 plants attained
the maximum of 54,000 tons K2O. In July, 1922,
potash was on the "free" list of the tariff and only
one plant was in commercial operation, one of those
at Searles Lake, and it had produced only 3000 tons
during the last year. Here the adventurers had in-
vested up to 1919 more than $6,000,000 and the
source of raw materials appeared to have possibili-
ties. At any rate, one stubborn chemist got a vision
of an American plant producing potash and other
chemicals, at a profit, in competition with the world,
and "thereby hangs our tale."
Searles "Lake" is a bed of crystallized salts about
12 square miles in area, 60 to 70 feet deep, per-
meated with brine, and fed by underground streams.
Summer evaporation keeps the brine an inch or so
below the surface of the salt. In winter, brine
stands an inch or more deep on top. In this "lake"
are eight salts of sodium, potassium and boron, in-
cluding some 36,000,(XX) tons of potassium chloride.
The composition of the brine is uniform and its
temperature throughout the year, 23 degrees Centi-
grade (73 Fahrenheit).
The stubborn chemist first got assurance that
enough patient money would be forthcoming to
carry ,through the researches and reorganization.
Then he picked a few young men who liked work
and responsibility and had the hardihood to work
and live in the desert. He showed them his vision.
With the bait of a big pioneer venture, this nucleus
drew other ambitious souls. He assured them the
project would be completed, that each would have
all the work and responsibility he was capable of
taking, and that there would be a freedom from
bossing and interference. The group became an
organism, a living, growing, co-operating entity,
made up of self-reliant, unafraid, resourceful indi-
viduals, disregarding personal comfort, 115 degrees
in the shade, or 24 hours a day.
The stubborn chemist certifies to his readers that
there are plenty of men who will work their heads
off intelligently and accomplish marvels, if manage-
ment will realize, and make them realize, the dig-
nity and importance of their work, give them au-
thority along with responsibility, free them from
nagging, from gloom spreaders, from constant dic-
tation, and ask only for final results in scientific
achievements coupled with economic success. And
pay checks must maintain an encouraging relation
to work done. From an establishment so managed
the weak, the petty and the deadwood will disap-
pear. Any man who is not contributing his best
feels lost and fades away.
Trona, for so the place was called after one of
the salts in Searles Lake, was, in 1919, just a desert
mining camp. The labor turnover was 500 per cent
per year, an entire new force on the average every
ten weeks. In 1926, turnover was normal. Trona is
now a beautiful town of a thousand inhabitants,
with tennis courts, golf links, swimming pool, steam
heat, running water, electric lights, and the other
comforts of American civilization, including after-
noon tea and "bridge."
Chemical and engineering problems were mas-
tered without stint. Here's a sample. Foaming in
the evaporation process in the plant made much
trouble and expense. Why? Research finally
proved that some organic substance in the brine
must be the cause. What? The desert tributary to
the lake had but few fauna and flora. Nevertheless.
Larrea mexicana, the creosote bush, which with
cactus and sage constitute most of the vegetation,
was found to be the culprit. Research also provided
a simple remedy, and foaming ceased.
Now the American Potash and Chemical Corpo-
ration can produce in the 1919 buildings, nearly 400
tons daily of potassium chloride, borax and boric
acid of very high grade, at prices below pre-war,

THE NEW WIND TUNNEL
By PROFESSOR FELIX W. PAWLOWSKI
Head of the Department of Aeronautical Engineering
THE construction of the new Aerodynamic
Laboratory was started several years ago in
connection with the new Engineering Build-
ing. The main feature of the equipment of an aero-
dynamic laboratory is a wind tunnel. The new wind
tunnel has been designed in such a way that a large
part of it called for reinforced concrete as the struc-
tural material and therefore could be executed to-
gether with the construction of the building at a
comparatively low cost.
After the construc-
tion of the building, the
completion of the wind
tunnel, requiring a con-
siderable amount of
rather expensive elec-
trical equipment, wood
work, etc., progressed
slowly due to the lim-
ited funds which could,
in justice to the other
departments, be spent
for this purpose. Due
to the generosity of the
Daniel Guggenheim
Fund for Promotion of
Aeronautics, the Uni-
versity obtained last
year a subsidy for com-
pletion of the equip-
ment of the new Aero-dynamic Laboratory and
the work is now going on at full speed.
The new laboratory will certainly rank among
the largest and more powerful equipments for aero-
dynamic research in this country and therefore may
deserve some interest on the part of readers of this
magazine, which is the reason for the following
brief description of it.
The laboratory is located in the basement of the
south wing of the East Engineering Building and
occupies approximately 10,000 sq. ft. of floor area;
it comprises two offices for the members of the
teaching staff, a drawing room accommodating 24
large drawing tables, a shop for the laboratory
mechanic, and the laboratory proper.
The chief apparatus of the laboratory is the wind
tunnel and it occupies approximately 4,000 sq. ft. of
floor area.
A wind tunnel, in general, is a device for pro-
duction of an air current in which scale models of
complete aircraft or of parts of air craft are im-
I'holo by Swain.

mersed in the air current and the action of the air
current upon these models can be measured by
means of properly adopted scales or balances, usu-
ally called dynamometers. The character of the
work and the methods used are, in general, very
much like those used in naval tanks in connection
with the models of ships.
There are a number of types of wind tunnels in
existence. In broad lines, a wind tunnel can be
described as a large tube through which the air
flows under the action
of a blower or fan, thus
providing the neces-
sary air current. The
flow of air through the
tube can be produced
by application of pres-
sure or suction on one
end of the tube.
The pressure action
of a centrifugal blower
of the Sirroco type has
been applied in the old
small wind tunnel in
the West Engineering
Building. This old
piece of apparatus is
still used for some ex-
periments and demon-
stration of certain aero-
dynamic principles in connection with the courses
in Aeronautical Engineering, although it is quite
inadequate for research work in some of the more
intricate phenomena, requiring more accurate meas-
urements, higher wind velocities, etc. For reason
of comparison with the new equipment it will be
mentioned here that the old wind tunnel of the
above type produces an air current of only 3 ft. x
3 ft. in cross-section and 40 miles per hour maxi-
mum velocity at the expense of 12 K. W. motor
energy to drive the blower.
The new wind tunnel is of the so-called "Venturi-
tube double-return type with Eiffel chamber" and
the arrangement of it is shown in Figure 2. The
Venturi-tube is located centrally and is interrupted
at the throat by the experimental chamber, so that
a free jet of air passes through the chamber, thus
giving a better visibility, free access to the model
under test, and a more even distribution of wind
velocity across the air current than is the case in
the wind tunnels of the continuous type. This fea-

ture was introduced in the wind tunnels by Eiffel
and therefore such an experimental chamber is
referred to in aerodynamics as Eiffel's chamber.
This central tube is of octagonal cross-section, 8 ft.
diameter at the throat, i. e., at the chamber, and
increasing in size in both directions toward the
ends.
The diameter
at the propel-
ler effecting the
air flow is 10.5
ft., thus the en-
ergy to be ap-
plied at the
propeller in or-
der to produce
a given veloc-
ity of air at the
throat is great-
ly reduced, i n
comparison
with a tunnel
of constant
cross - sectional
area. A further
reduction of en-
ergy, necessary to produce an air current of given
dimensions and velocity, is obtained by turning the
air current behind the propeller back and making
the air circulate inside of this return-type wind tun-
nel. The symmetrical arrangement of two return
ducts insures a more regular flow at the throat,
through the Eiffel's chamber.
The octagonal cross-sections of the Venturi-tube
is changing gradually, behind the propeller, into a
square section of 10.5 ft. x 10.5 ft., and at the en-
trance cone, on the opposite end, into a rectangular
section of 10.5 ft. x 14 ft. These two ends are
connected by means of the bends and return ducts
of constant height of 10.5 ft. and gradually varying
width.
The propeller, furnished by the Paragon Com-
pany, is driven by a Westinghouse variable speed
A. C. motor of the slip-ring type of 300 HP. maxi-
mum capacity through the intermediary of a disen-
gageable coupling and a long shaft supported by
four S.K.F. ball bearings. The bearings inside the
wind tunnel are encased in a cylindrical housing.
The supports of the bearings are streamlined and
the front of the hub is provided with an ellipsoidal
spinner of the same diameter as the cylindrical bear-
ing casing in order to provide, as much as possible,
an unobstructed flow of the air. Figure 4 shows
the view from the propeller toward the entrance
cone. The clastically attached wire net in front
of the propeller can also be seen in this view. It
is installed there for protection of the rapidly re-
volving propeller against injury from objects which

accidentally may be drawn in by the air current
from the Eiffel chamber.
The speed of the motor is controlled by the ob-
servers from the Eiffel chamber. The anticipated
wind velocity at the maximum rotational speed of
the propeller, of 1750 R.P.M. is 110 miles per hour,
however, this wind velocity can be raised still

forces. The last one is installed on a shelf on the
wall and visible in Figure 5. The maximum ca-
pacity of the dynamometer is 900 Ibs. for the lift,
200 Ibs. for the drag, and 60 Ibs. for the lateral
forces. It might be surprising to some of the read-
ers of this article that forces of that order may be
exerted by the air on the models, but this is never-
theless the case. In a wind tunnel of this caliber,
comparatively large models can be used. For exam-
ple, the multiplane, visible in Figure 5, has 54
inches wing span and over 5 sq. ft. wing area. It
will lift about 270 Ibs. at 100 m.p.h. and over oCO
Ibs. at 150 m.p.h. Large size of models enable to
reproduce correctly to scale various small structural
details which in the work with small models in
small wind tunnels must be omitted.
The construction of models for aerodynamic tests
is developing almost into an art of its own about
which a few words may be said at this place.
The determination of the air forces acting upon
the full size aircraft in flight is based on calculations
made from the measurements of the forces acting
on the model tested in the wind tunnels. These cal-
culations are made by application of the so-called
laws of dynamic similarity, which broadly may be
stated as follows: The air reactions (or the reac-
tions of any other medium, like water, for instance)
on two bodies of different size, but geometricallv
similar, are proportional to the square of the ratio
of any two corresponding linear dimensions of the
two bodies and also proportional to the square of
the ratio of velocities of the air in the two cases.
For example, if the model of the aircraft to be in-
vestigated is made to the scale of 8:1, the wind
velocity in the wind tunnel test was 60 miles per
hour and the velocity of flight of the aircraft is to
be 120 miles per hour and the forces acting upon
the model were found to be 80 pounds of lift and
10 pounds of drag then the actual lift and drag on
the full size aircraft will be

at the same density of the air. Of course actually
the problem is more complicated due to the neces-
sity of considering the variation of air density with
the changes of temperature and barometric pressure
and also of the effect of the viscosity of the medium
on small and large bodies, but the requirements of
geometrical similarity of the model to the full size
aircraft is basic.
While small inaccuracies in reproduction of the
shapes of certain parts of aircraft like fuselage and
landing chassis are not very important, the accurate
reproduction of the shapes of the wings is very im-
portant. The properties of the various types of wing
shapes can be studied separately by means of the
wing models (the so-called aerofoils) which must

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
SENIORS, JOBS AND OTHER THINGS
By H. J. BURTON
Chairman for Michigan of the N.E.L.A. Committee on Co-operalion with Educational Institutions
IT USED to be a matter of profound wonder to
me why so many men graduated from college
without knowing why. The graduate often can-
not tell why he went to college. He has no definite
plans as to his future life work.
In reply to a direct question as to what he intends
to do, he will answer, "Oh, you know what a col-
lege graduate expects." Or he might say, "Any-
thing at the start." Ask him to name the jobs he
would pick if given his choice. You will find that
he cannot give anything like a definite account of
what he would like to do. He sometimes has an idea
of what he expects to do eventually, but he has no
plan as to the best way to occupy his time in the
interval.
The point I want to make is: Seniors do not
start to think definitely about jobs until after they
graduate. I will agree that a lot of time is put in on
the subject before graduation but the fact remains
that the average student graduate is far from hav-
ing a definite idea as to what he intends to try and
do as his life work.
Hazy Ideas
I said in the beginning that I used to wonder
about all this, now I know from experience that the
new graduate's knowledge of the nature and re-
quirements of the field of work he should be most
interested in is most hazy and frequently incorrect.
He may form an opinion of a job by observation of
the behavior of a prominent man whom he mav
know—the thought being, "Well, if he can hold a
job like that, I should worry." He often does not
realize that the case under observation is excep-
tional, or that the job is not held because of the
trait or quality observed, but in spite of it.
The question of character is nearly always under-
estimated by the graduate. He is sure that "hard
headed business men" are not interested in personal
habits, especially when shop or plant jobs are con-
cerned. There is no question in my mind but that
character is a most important factor. Dean Cooley,
of the University of Michigan, has said that the
requirements for a successful engineer are:
"Ninety-eight per cent Character and Honesty,
1 per cent Tact, 1 per cent Technical Training."
Good health is an essential quality for almost any
job.
The Mann report of the Carnegie Foundation,
published some years ago, indicated that the quali-
fications for the senior job-seeker, stated in the
order of their desirability, are as follows:
"Character, Judgment, Efficiency, Understanding
of Men, Knowledge, Technique." Study this list
and measure or rate yourself before applying for a
job. Are you reliable? Are you a good team-
worker? Do you inspire confidence and go out of
your way to assist others? Are you willing to do
more than is required? Are you accurate, level-
headed, economical? How about your technical
knowledge?
You may ask the question, "lust what is expected
of a graduate, what may he expect?" Let us put
the matter to a test. An executive is sitting in his
office. Some recent graduates are without, waiting
to be interviewed. They are senior job-seekers. One
is called into the office. He slouches in, hat on head.
He does not know what he wants, but can do any-
thing. He admits it.
The next one is called and starts in by stating
that he has just spent four years studying electrical
engineering and he immediately hands the execu-
tive the copy of his school record and references.
The executive asks: "What did you do during va-
cation?"
"Worked in the old man's store, canvassed a
little, made pretty good money."
"Do you wish to get a job as a salesman?"
"No."
"What practical experience have you had along
electrical lines?"
"None, outside of my work at college."
In reply to further questions he implies that al-
though he has no definite idea of the job under con-
sideration, he expects to reach an executive position
soon and with little effort on his own part.
Willing to Do Anything
The next man called in says he wants work and
wants it badly and that he is willing to do anything,
and he adds, "Of course, within reason." He is a
good talker, sold books during two vacations, played
in a band at a resort one summer. When tentatively
offered a certain job he "frankly does not want that
kind of a job." He knows why he went to college
and it was chiefly to get away from such work. He
does not say just what kind of a job he does want
and it may or may not be because he is too modest.
The executive wonders why he went to college and

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
INDUSTRIES OF MICHIGAN-
SALT
V
By DOIVAL HAMILTON H \INES
THERE is an old fairy-story about a king who
was unable to decide which of his three
daughters loved him most deeply and truly
and who, after the indirect and cumbersome fashion
of those days, subjected them to a test, command-
ing that each should express her affection for him
in such terms that he might decide which of them
really cared most.
The eldest daugh-
ter promptly de-
clared that she
loved her royal
father better than
gold, the second—a
bit shy on invent-
iveness — could
think of nothing
better than silver,
while the third -
the real darling of
his eye, according
to the ancient tale
—had wit enough
to say that he was
m ore precious to
her than salt. This
workaday and pro-
saic answer dis-
pleased the king
until the clever young woman explained in detail
and made him see that he could worry through life
much more happily without gold or silver than
without salt. Then they all lived happily from then
on in the approved fashion—and the writer of the
ancient tale proved himself an excellent industrial
sociologist.
For salt today is just as commonplace and taken-
for-granted an article as it was in the time of the
fabled king; it remains, in the immortal phrase of
the small boy, "the stuff that makes potatoes taste
bad if you don't put it on 'em," and little or nothing
is known of its manufacture save by people who
chance to live near one of the few great salt-produc-
ing centers.
Michigan ranks first among the states of the
Union in the production of salt—a fact unknown to
a great many of its inhabitants. Yet this widespread
ignorance of an important industry is not as un-
natural as might at first appear. In the first place,
natural conditions have limited the commercial pro-
duction of salt to a few restricted areas, and in the

second, salt-manufacture in Michigan is very old
when compared with many of the other industries
of the state, so that the producers of the useful com-
modity were nearly all settled and established man-
ufacturing operations some years before the recent
industrial growth of the state, and their larger and
more complete development made little stir in the
industrial circles of
the state outside
those who were im-
mediately interest-
ed. It was just as
inevitable that
Michigan s h o u 1 d
become a great salt
making center as
that Pennsylvania
should produce
coal and iron and
Oklahoma oil, be-
ing a question of
natural resources.
A vast bed of salt
underlies most of
the Lower Penin-
sula of the state,
but only in a few
places does it come
near enough the
surface to make commercial working feasible. Near
Saginaw Bay, Midland and Detroit, and on the op-
posite shore of the state, near Manistee and Eud-
ington the bed is fairly near the surface and it is
probable that this bed lies not very far under the
surface across the entire breadth of the state within
this belt.
But the mere presence of the salt-beds did not
guarantee Michigan the certain establishment of an
enduring industry by any means. While getting
the salt to the surface and turning it into the edible
article of commerce is a comparatively simple pro-
cess, it entails a great deal of labor and expense and
its early and successful development in Michigan
is due, like so many other forms of the state's man-
ufactured wealth, to the lumber business.
Back in the days when men were making so much
money out of timber that they had ceased to be
mere lumbermen and had acquired the longer vision
and wider interests which come with the acquisition
of great capital, the profitable disposal of the im-
mense accumulations of cheap fuel became a real

problem. The slabs, chips and sawdust from the
sawmills gathered in vast heaps, far too great for
the requirements of the mills themselves. Yet, as
they were waste-products and the shipping facilities
of those days were rather elementary, they could

RATED FROM THE BRINE, AS IT COMES FROM THE
WELLS AFTER PASSING THROUGH THE WASHING TANK.
not be transported with profit, and if they were to
be used they would have to be used where they lay.
The existence of the great salt beds was known, and
some of the "lumber barons" sank wells, pumped
the brine to the surface into open "grainers" and
evaporated the salt by steam, using the excess fuel
to run the pumps and to furnish the steam for the
process of evaporation.
Thus, largely in an attempt to prevent the loss
of good dollars through waste, the lumbermen laid
the foundation of another industry destined to go
on long after the disappearance of the Michigan
forests had put an end to their own.
There is, of course, little more than an elementary
resemblance between the salt plants of the early day
and those of the present. Most of the pioneers of
the business, many of whom were "operating on a
shoestring" without anything like adequate capital,
did not sink their wells to the level of the salt-bed
proper, which is about 2000 feet below the surface
of the earth, but to the brine, which could be
reached at a depth of between 900 and 1000 feet.
This was, of course, a much cheaper operation, but
it resulted in an inferior quality of salt.
One of the earliest borings to the salt-bed proper
was made by D. C. McElroy of Marine City, some-
where around 1880. He had already driven a 900-
foot well into the brine level, and was evaporating
salt with the steam from his stave-mill, and rea-
soned that the salt-bed proper must be no great dis-
tance below the brine, and that he could obtain from
there a better and purer quality of salt. He sank a
test-well, employing the method which was later to
become common. He drove down a three-inch tub-
ing inside a six-inch casing. Fresh water from St.
Clair River was pumped down between the casing
and the tubing, and this water was turned to brine
through contact with the salt. The pressure of the
fresh water being pumped down the outer casing
forced the brine up the inner tubing, and it came
to the surface ready for the evaporation.
Like every other infant industry, salt manufac-
ture passed through a precarious period in its early
stages. In those days, before the development of
the later processes which have fairly revolutionized
the industry, "salt was salt," there was no particular
attempt to improve the product, and about the only
fashion in which the salt-maker could try to cope
with a competitor was to give the purchaser a larger
quantity of salt for the same amount of money.
This meant that quantity production was the one
way of increasing sales, and the early mills were
not equipped for manufacturing in great quantities.
Salt was cheap, and Michigan salt was no better
than salt manufactured in eastern states or shipped
in from Europe—the latter then, as still, of indif-
ferent quality but exceedingly cheap as it could be
carried as ballast by vessels returning to this
country.
While this open-pan or "graincr" method of pro-
ducing salt is no longer employed for the production
of any but what are known to the trade as "me-
dium" salts, its principles remain the basis for the
more elaborate and improved processes by which it
has been supplanted.
In this process the chief items of equipment are
huge shallow, open vats having steam coils at the
bottom. The brine is brought to the vats from the
storage tanks and heated to a temperature just be-
low the boiling point. By slow evaporation, the
water is released from the brine, causing the salt

to form into flaky grains on the surface and then
settle to the bottom of the vat. When the process

veyors to the storehouse, where it remains to drain
and "ripen" until ready to be shipped in barrels.
In modern salt plants (such as that of Ruggles
and Rademaker at Manistee, which was risked by
the writer) the grainer method has been supplanted
for the production of high grade salt by the "vacu-
um pan" process. The vacuum pan, described in
untechnical language, consists of two great cones
connected by a cylinder called a "steam belt." At
the top and bottom of the latter are flue-sheets con-
nected by 2200 copper tubes, each four and one-half
feet long, through which the brine can pass, or
nearly two miles of tubing to each pan. Brine from
the settling tanks is admitted to the lower cone, and
steam fills the steam-belt outside the flues, the cir-
culation of the brine through the flues and in the
cones being assisted by an agitator in the lower
cone. Passing downward, the brine goes through
a well in the center of the steam-belt.
When sufficiently evaporated, the salt, mixed
with brine, is pumped from the bottom of the pan
into a washing tank. This is the next step in the
process of manufacture when only a single pan is
used, but in the "quadruple effect system," such as
used at the "R. &amp; R." salt factory, four vacuum
pans instead of one are used, the vapor passing from
the first into the second pan and so on through the
four, thereby the heat from the steam being used
four times. Although the temperature in each suc-
ceeding tank is lower than in the one preceding the
brine is kept boiling due to the partial vacuum cre-
ated, permitting re-use of the steam and a highly
efficient and economical process.
A most important step in the process is the dry-
ing of the salt. This is done in great revolving
drums or kilns, thirty-two feet long and large
enough in diameter so that a full-grown man can
stand upright inside one of them. They revolve
slowly, heated air being blown through them as
they turn. The kilns are lined with Monel metal to
prevent discoloration of the salt.
A third process, known as the Alberger Process,
is employed by the Diamond Crystal Salt Co., of
St. Clair. It takes its name from another pioneer of
the industry, J. L. Alberger, who came to St. Clair
from Buffalo, N. Y., in 1886.
In this process the brine is drawn from the stor-
age tanks into a series of heaters, four to a series,
the heat being supplied by steam, passing through
them successively under pressure, and reaching in
the last of the heaters a temperature far above the
boiling point. The one serious impurity found in
salt is sulphate of lime, or gypsum, which is insolu-
ble, indigestible and unassimilable. At the temper-
ature to which the brine is heated, the gypsum is
precipitated, this action being assisted by drawing
the brine into filters where the precipitated gypsum
deposits on gravel, precisely as lime forms on the
bottom of a tea kettle.
The formation of the salt grains is brought about
by the removal of the high pressure required to pro-
duce the necessary temperatures for the precipita-
tion of the gypsum. The small salt grains are
formed in evaporators, to which the brine passes
directly from the heaters. The larger grains or
flakes form in huge pans to which the brine is next
conveyed. At the Diamond Crvstal works, the brine
is next carried to centrifugal driers, revolving at a
speed of 600 revolutions per minute.

The perfection of such processes as the vacuum
pan and the Alberger marked the beginning of u
new era in salt making. The days when "salt was
salt" were definitely over. In the sifting rooms of
the modern plants, the dried salt is sifted and sorted
automatically into different bins, graded all the way
from the fine salt for table use to the coarser grained
article used in such huge quantities by the meat
packer, ice cream manufacturer and so on. Now
the manufacturer no longer stresses the size of his
package, but the purity of his product and its per-
fect fitness for the particular use for which it is
intended.
Naturally the improvements in salt making have
not been confined to the actual process of manu-
facture. Modern ingenuity has been exerted on
other phases of the business with results which are,
to the uninitiated layman, even more impressive. In
the early days, the salt was packed by- hand into
barrels from the nearest cooper shop or bags from
the most convenient bag maker. Now, although
much of it still goes into bags and barrels, the pack-
ing is done by machinery and many of the contain-
ers arc made under the same roof which shelters
the vacuum pans and driers.
Barrel making, for instance, at the Diamond
Crystal plant has ceased to be a handicraft and be-

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
AIRPORT AUTOMATICALLY LIGHTED BY
LANDING PLANE
By 0. M. OSTLUND
Research Engineer of Weslinghouse Electric $ Mfg. Co.
A FORMIDABLE enemy of night flying—the
unilluminated landing fie-Id—was conquered
automatically by the modern wizardry of
electricity at Bettis Field, McKeesport, Pa., U. S.
A. recently. At a public demonstration there the
hum of a plane, one thousand feet in the air, closed
a switch on the landing field. A hank of airport
floodlights were turned on, and an instant later the
pilot was gliding safely along a path ol illumina-
tion that was called
into being by the voice
of his own plane. Thou-
sands witnessed the
successful exhibition of
the sound-sensitive au-
tomatic lighting agency
developed by T. Spoon-
er. Research Engineer
of the Westinghouse
Electric and Manufac-
turing Company.
Merle Moltrup, Chief
of the Air Mail Pilots
at Bettis Field, made
the landing w h i c h
opens a new volume in
the annals of aviation.
Essentially the function of the device is to use the
drone of an airplane to control electrical energy.
At first this controlled energy is a tiny weakling,
but it is nursed along by a corps of amplifiers, and
finally ,emerges as a husky child capable of clos-
ing a good-sized lighting switch. This switch locks
automatically and the lights remain on until turned
off by the field attendant.
A loudspeaker constitutes the "Ear" of the mech-
anism. It works in reverse order, inhaling rather
than exhaling sound. The loudspeaker laid on its
back gives the apparatus a directive effect with ref-
erence to noises from above. A microphone com-
pletes the,auditory section. After passing through
the initial amplifier the impulse is received by a
resonant circuit set, tuned to the dominant fre-
quency of the airplane drone. Here a second am-
plifier does its work and then the thread is picked
up by a device which has an amplifying power of
loo.coo.ott).
The electrical impulse, which a split second be-
fore was awakened by the hum of the plane, is now
ready for the time-limit relay—the last step in the

process before the long arm of electricity reaches
out to close the power switch.
The time-limit relay is a vital unit in the Spoon-
er Sound-Selective Switch. Without this feature
the automatic lighting mechanism might be oper-
ated by sporadic transient noises. With the time-
limit feature nothing less than the continuous hum,
characteristic of the moving plane, will operate the
apparatus and light the field.
Lacking this unit the
apparatus would be
like a nerve frazzled
watchman, who start-
led by the slightest dis-
turbance, jumps to the
lighting s w i t c h, not
knowing whether the
noise he heard came
from the air, or the
earth. The time-limit
agency gives the
Spooner device the ad-
vantage of the self-pos-
sessed watchman who
thinks and knows what
he is about to do before
he acts.
Preliminary to the demonstration Mr. Spooner
made frequent visits to Bettis field studying, as it
were, the language of the airplane, to determine
the nature of the sound he had to deal with. Chief
Pilot Moltrup flew high and low while the engi-
neer and his staff took notes below, aided by a
sound analyser.
The lights that went into action automatically
came from a new type of airport projector devel-
oped by the Westinghouse Company.
The new unit is designed to furnish sufficient il-
lumination over an uneven field, at the same time
keeping the source of light low and eliminating ob-
jectionable glare in the eyes of the aviator. It con-
sists essentially of a steel drum 25 inches in diam-
eter and 19 inches deep, mounted on a 2i/, inch
pipe standard. Mounted within the drum are a
lamp socket with vertical, lateral and in-and-out
focusing adjustments, a 23-inch parabolic metal
reflector of such focal length that all reflected rays
come approximately within a 3 degree divergence,
and a system of louvers to absorb all those rays
of direct light the upward tilt of which exceeds lj/i

degrees. A spread lens mounted in front of the
shell gives a horizontal spread of 45 degrees to the
beam.
The unit is so mounted on the pipe standard that
it may be rotated horizontally, or tilted vertically
two degrees above and six degrees below the hori-
zontal. It is dust and rain proof.
When equipped with a 1500-watt projection lamp
and spread lens, the unit gives a maximum inten-
sity of 250,000 C. P., with an estimated intensity
with plain lens of 3,000,000 C. P. The projector
may be accurately focused by the use of a day-
light lamp-setter developed for the purpose.
By spacing a number of such units on the side
lines at intervals of 300 to 350 feet, sufficient pene-
tration is obtained even for large fields, and the
units can be individually adjusted to take care of
any unevenness in the surface of the ground.
ROLLING MILL DRIVES
(Continued from papre 9)
Or, the slip energy may be transformed by means
of a frequency converter, F, running at the motor
speed, and a regulating transformer, T, Fig. 3E,
into line frequency and voltage. Finally, it may be
converted suitably by a frequency converter, F, Fig.
3F, separately driven by a small synchronous mo-
tor, A, and is then returned as mechanical power to
the main shaft by means of a synchronous motor,
S; its excitation provides the speed regulating
means. Several other schemes, employing a fre-
quency converter, are also conceivable.
Either scheme is capable of regulating the speed
of the main motor not only below but also above
synchronism, forming a so-called double range
drive. Obviously the slip energy is then of a reverse
direction; it flows from the regulating machines to
the slip-rings, and not from them; the arrows, see
Fig. 3, indicating, by dotted lines, the flow of power
will have to be reversed. The Scherbius and the
frequency converter systems arc usually of the
double range type; on account of certain difficulties
of operating the Kraemer drives close to synchron-
ism (i. e., at a very low frequency at the synchron-
ous converter C) and of inability to go through syn-
chronism under load, these drives are usually built
as single range equipments, for sub-synchronous
operation only.
It will be observed that with all of these schemes
the main part of the a-c. power is converted but
once until it reaches the mill coupling; only the
balance of power or the slip energy goes through
more than one transformation before it is utilized.
Naturally, the over-all efficiency is higher than with
the d-c. drives and is usually around 90 per cent at
full load. The machines used for speed regulation
should have a capacity depending on the size of
the main motor and on the amount of speed range.
Therefore, the greater the speed range, the more
expensive becomes the a-c. speed regulating equip-
ment, and the less becomes its advantage over a
d-c. drive, both from the standpoint of first cost
and efficiency. Obviously, with a double-range
drive, the same speed regulating equipment is util-
ized to a greater extent than with a single range
drive.
Conclusion
None of the several electrical layouts described
on the preceding pages should be considered as any-
thing more than what they were originally intended
for:—a good combination of electrical machines to
fit a set of given requirements. Certain principles
may be used again in some future drives; the whole
combination may never be repeated. Electric drives
for nicdern large rolling mills can hardly be stand-
ardized. They rather are and may rightly be called
"custom made."
Many single mills require up to, or over, 20,000
h. p. in electric drives; investment runs into several
hundred thousands of dollars; the cost of power
consumed in a year may approach the same figure.
This alone justifies a thorough engineering study
and a preparation of an individual layout for each
case. Machines of special design need not neces-
sarily be built for any new drive, but there is usu-
ally a broad field for working up a good new com-
bination of apparatus.
It was the author's intention to point out, by
means of the several illustrated schemes, that such
an opportunity is present in most cases and that
the electrical engineers seldom let such opportuni-
ties slip by.— Reprinted by courtesy of The Journal

THE ENGINEER AND COMMUNITY
LIFE
(Continued fiom page 6)
quest for more, and especially the widespread dis-
tribution of services and facilities and manufactured
goods of various kinds, all these things mark what
may be called the second stage in the broadening
of the engineering field. But while both science and
engineering have progressed rapidly, and while
both have expanded tremendously, there is now the
appearance of engineering treading upon the heels
of science, pressing for new ground to be conquered
and occupied, clamoring for new discoveries capa-
ble of being developed for use.
With all these things clearly in view it seems per-
fectly obvious that the time has come for the engi-
neer once more to broaden his foundation, by rest-
ing his work upon the social sciences as well as
upon the mathematical and physical. It seems a
fair question :—whether he should go on indefinitely
in line with his more recent past, creating leisure
but without giving thought to the way in which it
may be spent, distributing physical comforts and
pleasures in vast profusion but without regard to
their spiritual values or their ultimate social conse-
quences, cultivating and stimulating the gregarious
instincts of people without fully taking care of them
when they are herded into large cities. It seems a
fair answer:—that he should honestly accept what-
ever may be his due share of responsibility for the
social welfare as well as the physical well being of
mankind, and prepare himself to carry it. This will
mean that he must draw heavily upon the great re-
sources of the social sciences, as well as upon the
mathematical and physical, for the more extensive
equipment with which to meet the varied require-
ments of those wider fields which lie before him.
These broader opportunities are admittedly open
to the engineer in the field of industrial manage-
ment. Especially this is true in the large manufac-
turing concerns where huge aggregations of capital
and plant require for their successful management
not only the technique of securing and handling and
fabricating physical materials, but also the ability
to understand and manage the human problems of
labor, of employment, of team work, of industrial
organization. Just as many an ingenious and profit-
able machine has been rendered practicable and use-
ful only by solving the problem of friction between
its moving parts, so in like manner many an in-
dustrial system can be made to function success-
fully only by the elimination of human friction. The
general principle is the same in both cases, but in
the first it is only a matter of physical materials and
movements, while in the second it is the more deli-
cate problem of human qualities and of human ac-
tions and reactions.
In commerce and trade analogous situations ex-
ist, with many attractive opportunities open to the
engineer who brings with him a sympathetic under-
standing of human relationships as well as a
grounding in economics. But it is in the application
of the science and the arts of the engineer directly
to community life that large-scale problems in the
greatest number and variety are pressing for so-
lution. In the case of many of these problems, such
as the well established public utilities, the physical
basis may be pretty well worked out and under-
stood while the social relationships may be neither
clearlv recognized nor honestly faced. In others,
such as certain phases of public sanitation, improve-
ments may go forward haltingly and with many set-
backs because of tactless methods employed or be-
cause of failure to take account of well known traits
of human nature. Many questions related to public
works or public service are voted up or down ac-
cording to some shibboleth of the man on the street,
instead of according to the solid facts in the case.
The whole theory and practice of special assess-
ment as a means of financing those community
improvements which confer special private benefits
but which at the same time are invested with a
public interest, sorely needs competent engineer-
ing guidance. Many other illustrations might be
mentioned, but surely enough has been said to
indicate the extent of the field which is here so
wide open to useful and profitable endeavor.
There is probably no field today in which the
broad scientific training and the direct-minded
habit of the engineer is more needed, nor one in
which, in the long run, intelligent application is
more certain to be generously rewarded.
DRY POINT ETCHING
(Continued from pase 11)
aided by the employment of a printer of good taste
to heighten its effect. When the artist himself does
the printing it may be regarded as a continuation of
his work and a certain freedom must therefore be
allowed him to give expression to what is in his
mind. One way to get this tone is to wipe the plate
fairly clean, and then pass a hot, light cloth over
it. How much film to leave and where to leave it
are matters of judgment; and in this retroussage
the fine printer distinguishes himself from the men
of poorer taste. There is no better way of getting
a sunset glow, of rendering the soft shadows of
wind-stirred foliage in Black and \Vhite than by
this process. The tone left on the plate should,
however, only be used to heighten the desired ef-
fect, and never to cover the defects of a poor line
drawing.
All of the illustrations are dry-points, and in a
meager way tend to give some idea of the possi-
bilities and extent of effects which may be pro-


Page 23
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
duced. The mechanical process of reproducing-, and
generally reducing, an original proof is not perfect,
and the reproductions are never as soft and velvety
or as sparkling as the original. The subtle use of
the retroussage and even a good deal of fine indi-
cation are lost.
The basis upon which all graphic art is built up
is line. The feeling for line is not born in us, and
so few of us can comprehend its meaning. It, and
nothing else, is the making of true graphic art, for
it introduces the factor of creative ability. Lines
are not found in nature, but must be created by
the artist. Do not attach an excessive importance to
correctness of drawing in Black and White art. The
ability to draw depends only on the training of
hand and eye, and they can be trained. But genius
can not be acquired, and it is genius which enables
the artist to translate nature into a pleasing system
of lines.
The powerful open line work in prints is what is
good and of lasting value. Too delicate tone, over
finish, and elaboration savor of the copyist. The less
detail, the less elaborate a print is, the more sug-
gestive and finer it becomes. The soul of the art
of etching is to stimulate the fancy and the imagina-
tion.
So look at etchings not as you do at oil paintings,
or at nature, but from the point of view adjusted to
the character of the art. Only in this way will you
be able to extract the artistic pleasure that it is
able to afford you.
SALT
(Continued from page 19)
come a process largely mechanical. The staves are
assembled and held together by temporary hoops,
transferred to another machine where the ends of
the staves are grooved to hold the heads, fitted by
machinery with the middle hoops (also made in the
plant) and shaped while this is being done more
accurately than the cooper could do so by hand,
then headed in still another machine, where com-
pressed air takes the place of the cooper's clatter-
ing hammer.
Even more absorbing to the layman (although it
is no more than a detail of the business) is the mak-
ing and packing of the round pasteboard can which
has so largely taken the place of the cloth bag as a
container of high grade table salt. The whole job
is not only done in the salt mill, but it is done
largely without the assistance of human hands. The
raw material consists of huge rolls of pasteboard,
almost as large as the rolls of print paper which one
sees in the pressroom of a modern newspaper.
These rolls are unwound onto machines which cut
them into strips of the proper width. These strips
then pass through other machines which coat them
on one side with asphalt paint and on the other with
paste, so that the wall of the box is three-ply in
thickness and thoroughly moisture proof. Machines
punch out the round bottoms and set them in place,
machines punch out and bend into shape the round
covers, other machines paste on the labels, and still
others shrink them into place, machines attend to
the filling of the cans, machines shunt them here
and there from one stage of their growth to another.
Practically the one point at which the assistance of
human hands is required is the setting in of the
little metal spout through which the salt is poured
from the container for household use—and beyond
a doubt the machine for that operation will appear
in the course of time.
At one plant, where the process requires an enor-
mous amount of steam and the furnace and boiler
room is the veritable heart of the mill, old-fashioned
stoking of the furnaces was replaced by automatic
stokers several years ago, and now the automatic-
stoker is being supplanted by a still more advanced
method of reducing the coal to a powder and blow-
ing it into the furnaces, a process which secures al-
most total combustion and elimination of waste.
Two words seem to have become the salt mak-
er's chief concern—purity and efficiency. Every-
where is a degree of cleanliness suggestive of the
laboratory rather than the mill, and everywhere the
plants not only bristle with the most ingenious de-
vices for the actual manufacture but with scientific
apparatus for keeping a constant check upon every
function of the mill. Every pound of coal, every
pound of steam, every quart of brine is measured
and weighed not only once but many times, so that
there is constant progress toward the elimination
of loss and waste motion.
The following figures are taken from the Census
of 1920 and are not wholly accurate for the present

While small as compared with many of the other
industries of the state, Michigan's salt-making must
be reckoned as among its most important, not mere-
ly because it has given the state the leading position
in this field, but because the qualities of the men
engaged in the business have developed some of
the most important improvements of the process
within the borders of Michigan and have left an in-
dustry characterized by a very impressive pride in
its own development.
THE NEW WIND TUNNEL
(Continued from page 15)
large variation of the aerodynamic properties of the
wings.
These aerofoils are made of wood or of reinforced
plaster of Paris. When the tests are to be made at
comparatively high wing velocities and resultant air
reactions are of an order of hundreds of pounds the
question of strength comes in and the aerofoils must
be made of metal (aluminum, bronze or even steel).
Handwork is not always possible or adequate for
making aerofoils and would be too expensive. Spe-
cial machines are therefore, developed for cutting
aerofoils from the different materials. In these ma-
chines the cutting tool is operated through an inter-
mediary or guided by templates made with the ut-
most accuracy in metal from drawings of the desired
profiles of the wings to be investigated.
A special room has been provided in the new
aerodynamic laboratory for the installation of two
different aerofoil machines. These machines are de-
signed at the present time. One of these will be for
cutting wooden aerofoils, the other for casting of
plaster of Paris aerofoils.
As it is necessary to provide for the various in-
vestigations aerofoils of rather complicated shapes,
the design of a suitable machine is a rather difficult
problem. I will mention here only that the outlines
of the wings used in modern aircraft are very sel-
dom plane rectangular. Neglecting the different
types of wing tips which are usually rounded in
different ways, the width and the thickness of the
wing varies often along the span of the wing, i. e.,
the wings are very often tapered both in width and
thickness; besides, the profile (cross-section of the
wing) may also vary along the span and the profiles
do not necessarily remain geometrically similar,
further the two symmetrical halves of the wing may
be set together at a certain angle in the plane of the
wing (the so-called sweep-back) or in a plane per-
pendicular to the plane of the wing (dihedral). All
these requirements lead to an extreme variety of
wing forms and require complicated machinery for
production.
Other apparatus and dynamometers are now
under construction, and, therefore, will be men-
tioned here only briefly.
A heavy drag dynamometer built around a 500-
pound Toledo balance for experiments with objects
in which the determination of drag will be the prime
object, like: large size models of fuselages, models
of dirigibles, engine radiators, airplane wheels in
full size, etc.
A propeller dynamometer built around an electric
motor of 200 h. p. capacity, enabling the use of 6-
foot diameter propeller models, twice the size of
any models used elsewhere, thus making it possible
to eliminate certain errors in measurements. The
dynamometer is of such a construction that it will
permit the measurement of both the positive and
the negative thrusts and torques at different po-
sitions of the axis of the propeller relatively to the
direction of air flow, at fixed positions, and while
the axis of the propeller oscillates about any given
position. It is expected that this apparatus will open
new vistas in propeller research.
A dynamic balance or an oscillograph, to record
photographically the oscillations of an airplane
about its axes and furnishing data for determination
of the dynamic stability of airplanes.
Most of the above dynamometers are movable, on
casters, to be put in or taken out of the Eiffel's
chamber through the especially provided big doors
visible in Fig. 2, for the following reason: It is a
well known fact that it usually takes little time to
run an aerodynamic test, very often one-half hour,
while it takes several hours and even a few days to
prepare the experiment on a dynamometer.
Consequently, since it will be possible to prepare
experiments on the dynamometers outside of the
wind tunnel without interfering with an experi-
ment in process, the output of the wind tunnel will
be greatly increased in comparison with other lab-
oratories in which the dynamometer is a permanent
feature of the wind tunnel. In this way the new
laboratory will be able to better respond to the de-
mands for tests of the rapidly developing aero-
nautical industries of the country.
It might be mentioned here also that another,
small size high speed wind tunnel is being designed,
to be operated intermittently by the same motor as
the large one. In this wind tunnel it is attempted
to obtain wind velocities approaching the velocity
of sound; it will serve for calibration of speedome-
ters for airplanes, test of elements, of propeller
blades, and in general for the study of high speed
phenomena.

SENIORS—JOBS
(Continued from page 16)
studied engineering and also why he applied to an
engineering concern for a job.
The next man is called. He is asked to be seated.
In answer to a question he states simply and to the
point that he is a recent electrical engineering
graduate. He gained some little experience as a
sub-station operator and as a trouble shooter. On
being questioned further it is learned he also has
had some transmission line construction experience,
having worked during one summer vacation as a
"ground-man." He would like very much to get
some steam plant experience, both in the turbine
and boiler room. "What branch of the work do you
expect to follow as a life work?"
"When I have had enough experience I would
like to be a designing engineer."
"Will you be content with that all your life?"
"I hope some day to become a public utility ex-
ecutive."
When questioned further regarding his desires
and ambitions it is learned he has consulted not
only the professors at college but some of the lead-
ing engineers in the country, either by correspond-
ence or in person when they had visited the college.
The college record of the applicants interviewed
was practically identical and they all "applied for"
the same job. Who got the job? No, it does not
matter what the executive had to offer. You can
bet your bottom dollar he did not let one of the
boys slip through his fingers.
What is to be done about all this? The answer
is fairly simple. It is, start as soon as possible to
have a goal in sight and train for it. The man who
persistently aims at the bull's eye learns sooner or
later to hit it. He will not continue to shoot all
over the lot. You do not think of trying to make
the team without practice. You would be laughed
off the field. Work and play for the final result.
Don't worry too much about it. Don't be afraid of
making a wrong choice. A definite goal is better
than none. All winds are unfavorable to a ship
without a definite port in sight.
Actions speak louder than words. Sometimes you
can hear neither because of clothes. Pay attention
to details, shoes, fingernails. This does not mean
that you have to put on a false front, and an af-
fected manner. Deal with facts. Should you make
a misstatement in your eagerness to make a favor-
able impression, immediately correct it, even if ap-
parently unnoticed. Remember the boss has inter-
viewed graduates before, possibly a thousand or
more. Also remember he often has had plant or
shop training as a foundation for his job. The time
to think of what you are going to do or say when
starting out to land your job is now, whether you
are a freshman, sophomore, junior or senior.
It is true jobs are often a question of supply and
demand, but the right kind of a man can land one
almost anytime. Such a one came into my office
some years ago, during a severe industrial slump.
He appeared very much discouraged. Because of
conditions we could not put on another man. I
helped him prepare a list of ten industrial concerns
who were likely to have jobs according to his speci-
fications, which were definite. It was about 8:00
o'clock when he left my ofiice and I bet him he
would land the job he wanted before he had tried
the tenth place. About 2 :00 o'clock he telephoned
me that I had won the bet.
You can bank on this statement. If the gradua'te
has character and an objective he need not worry.
The fact that he is a graduate is sufficient evidence
his technical training is, or should be, taken care of.
Work we must, whether we have a college educa-
tion or not. If we do not work with our hands we
must toil in some other way. Should you get a
job and find you do not like it, get dissatisfied with
yourself, not your job, and look ahead and plan the
next step of the journey toward your goal.—Re-
printed by courtesy of Wisconsin Engineer.

with a profit. Instead of tradition, a loud voice and
a strong arm, the plant is run on meters, thermome-
ters, charts and accurate knowledge. Every minute

charged from the plant. Every minute 2()D,(.XX) gal-

marketing and purchasing. Research, intelligently
managed, pays.—A research narrative of the Engi-
neering Foundation.
Electric Lampx (Hoir Without Fil
Tiny electric lamps that have no filaments are
now available. They produce a little light by the
activation of the contained gas which gives a nega-
tive glow around the negative electrode. These
lamps will illuminate small clock faces, act as night
markers of various sorts, or serve as indicators by
which to determine whether electric irons or cel-
lar lights are shut off. Some are so tiny that they
could be burned for 5,000 hours for 1 cent, except
for the fact that the normal life of such lamps is
2.000 hours—about double that of the average elec-
tric lamp.—The Synchroscope.

Foreword
To you who have chosen engineering as the pro-
fession in which to make your contributions to the
world and who are this year entering the College
of Engineering as freshmen, we extend our most
friendly greeting. You have not chosen the easi-
est path by which to secure a university degree nor
have you chosen the hardest. It is for you your-
selves to make that path what it may become. You
will find times when it may seem to you that you
are on the wrong track and that the time has come
for you to change. Then you must go slowly for
the best may make mistakes. You, yourselves indi-
vidually, know the reason why you came here to
study engineering; pursue your studies in the fu-
ture for the same reason and be assured you will
not fall short of the goal. When you find the go-
ing difficult remember that hundreds have traveled
the same path before you and have not found the
obstructions insurmountable. As soon as you have
progressed a part of the way you will find a thou-
sand vistas open before you in which to broaden
and extend your knowledge and influence.
o
Dean Cooley and the Engineering College
It is not without most sincere regret that the
College of Engineering hears of the resignation of
its much reverenced dean, Mortimer E. Cooley. One
who has done more to make the Engineering Col-
lege what it is than any other man has ever done or
can hope to do. From a rough, temporary, little shop
with a floor space amounting to about 1720 square
feet, to the three, large, excellently equipped build-
ings having a total of some 500,000 square feet floor
space; from three or four courses taught by two in-
structors, to hundreds of courses taught by over 160
professors, instructors, and assistants; and from an
enrollment of less than thirty, to an enrollment of
more than 1800, are stories of progress of the En-
gineering College which indicate the energy, the
ability, and the devotion of the man at the helm.
Dean Cooley, the Grand Old Man of the Engi-
neering College, was born on a farm near Canan-
daigua. N. Y., on March 28, 1855. He'attended the
rural school and the Canandaigua Academy until
the age of seventeen, when he became a teacher in
-a school near Canandaigua. When nineteen he en-
tered the U. S. Naval Academy as a cadet engineer.
After graduating in 1878 he shipped on various
naval craft, seeing considerable of the world and
gaining practical experience.
The Navy Department sent him to Michigan in
1881 to teach mechanical engineering. He was
given a little shanty costing about $1,500 in which
to display his wares, which were blacksmithing,
machine shop, and pattern making. At the end of
four years the regents of the university invited him
to resign from the Navy and accept the professor-
ship of mechanical engineering. He made the de-
cision to remain at the university, and has not
changed it since.
In 1904 he became Dean of the Colleges of En-
gineering and Architecture. From that time to this,
the colleges have expanded under his careful direc-
tion. His policy has been conservative and thought-
ful. He has never adopted new measures rashly,
but has always weighed the ideas carefully and dis-
cerned their true worth. In this way his work has
been constructive. The colleges have been firmly
founded.
This development has been mutual. Dean Cooley
and the colleges have matured together. They are,
each the product of the other. The greatness of the
one has reflected itself on the other until each has
become so interlocked with the other that it is
hardly conceivable that the one can be—without
the other.
Reading
What and how one reads is a big factor in de-
termining the character and ability of an individual.
This is indeed true of an Engineer. The courses
that go to make up the present day Engineering
College curricula are of necessity technical and this
technical field is so large that little time is left for
non-technical courses, courses that give the engi-
neer a broader and more cultured outlook on life.
The engineer of tomorrow much more than the en-
gineer of today or yesterday must have a broad
and complete outlook on life and on the society of


Page 27
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
which he is a very important part. An excellent
way for the engineer to supplement his technical
education is by reading good literature. Roger Ba-
con has said, "That reading makes a man full." By
full he means not only full of knowledge, but also
full of sympathy and understanding. To read much
is to have many interesting and pleasurable experi-
ences. Each new bit that one reads can bring to
one a new glimpse of life or a new point of view
which he has perhaps overlooked before. In the
short time that is allotted to each one of us it is
impossible to have a really wide range of experi-
ences yet it is possible by reading to learn and
profit by the experiences of many others. Read-
ing to the engineer should mean much more than
simply a pleasant pastime. There is a large amount
of literature that the engineer must read which is
more or less technical, and one must learn to read
technical literature. It is not easy to read a long
and detailed treatice, and the ability to do it can
only be accpuired by practice. Why not acquire the
reading habit while you are still in college if you
have not already done so? The big alibi of the
undergraduate is that he has no time, there is al-
ways something else that seems more important
or attractive. Lack of time is one of the most fre-
quent pleas of people today both in college and out.
Yet there are still twenty-four hours in each day.
It must be that we do not use our time to the best
advantage. If you do not find time to read why
not form the habit of having a good book handy
on your desk that you can pick up and read when
you have a few minutes that you might otherwise
waste. True this is perhaps not the best way to
read a book, nevertheless it is a way of getting it
read and the more you practice this habit the more
time you are going to find to practice it in.
o
A Problem
The fact that impure water consumed by human
beings causes outbreaks of different maladies has
been know:n from time immemorial. The ancient
Romans appreciated this when they spent so much
time and labor to bring their water supplies through
their magnificent aqueducts from beyond the reach
of pollution. The most important questions to be
considered in connection with the water supply are
(1): whether it is wholly free from the possibil-
ity of distributing disease; (2) whether it is likely
to remain in such a condition. These are questions
of much more importance than economy in secur-
ing or distributing water and should therefore first
engage the attention of the sanitary engineer. There
is probably no group that is more responsible to
public welfare than the sanitary engineers, but it
is not to them that the responsibility of infectional
disease can be attributed. When the engineer has
satisfactorily answered the first question his efforts
are turned toward the second question. In nearly
all cases his work is entirely completed and he has
found a complete solution. The responsibility of
his solution is in the hands of the community and
in many cases the result is as annihilating as Hen-
rik Ibsen's play, "The Enemy of the People."
Many cities have spent enormous fees for engi-
neers to analyze the conditions of the existing water
supply and, after receiving the reports and sugges-
tions, the community is involved in civil argument
as to whether the discussed constructions are advis-
able. There may be no source of danger in the
present supply but to what avail is the ingenious
thought and effort?
A careful study of statistics disclosed the fact
that in places where a pure water has been substi-
tuted fur a badly polluted one, there has been a
greater reduction in the death rate of typhoid fever
alone. Investigations have found that for one life
saved due to typhoid fever by improved water sup-
plies from three to six have been saved from gen-
eral causes. This may be due to the fact that other
diseases are water born to a greater or less extent,
or that an improved water supply places the indi-
vidual in better physical condition to combat any
disease which may attack him. A potable water is
a community's greatest asset and the benefits to be
derived are certainly of such a character that those
who are directing public welfare should not hesi-
tate when the conditions have been analyzed and
the suggestions made by a competent engineer. The
progress of engineering which has been so pro-
nounced in the past decade is not dependent upon
the careful research and scientific study of those
so intrusted but upon the leaders of the community
who hesitate upon vital questions. A purification
of water is always a necessity and a surer way of
protecting the welfare of the community than to
continue in doubt in such a vital matter.
The Metric System in Engineering
The subject of weights and measures has always
been one that is hard to get at and one which con-
sequently is much discussed but little changed.
The average high school student today recognizes
the immense value of such a system as the metric
system from the standpoint of both convenience
and standardization when compared to the old
clumsy English system of units. Any engineering
student will say that he would rather work with
metric units than English units. Vet, in spite of
all its recognized and acknowledged conveniences,
we find the entire engineering profession in Amer-
ica and England still clinging doggedly to a clumsy
antiquated system used by our forefathers because
they had none better.
In his studies of physics the engineer finds nearly

to the use of that aluminum alloy in airplane con-
struction. It has been found that this alloy, par-
ticularly when exposed to salt air, may become brit-
tle through a type of corrosion that is not appar-
ent on the surface and that cannot be detected by
inspection. This corrosion, which is termed "in-
tercrystallinc embrittlement," weakens the bond
between the crystal grains that make up the alloy.
According to an official statement based upon
the laboratory work of the government experts,
"the greatest drawback to long life and safety of
duralumin for aircraft construction may be almost
completely eliminated by means that are commer-
cially practicable." The tests have proved first,
that by quenching the metal in cold instead of in
hot water, as is the common practice, the resistance
to intercrystalline corrosion is markedly increased.
Second, by giving duralumin a protective coat of
unalloyed aluminum it is possible to obtain fur-
ther insurance against corrosion. Commercially
pure aluminum is not subject to intercrystalline em-
brittlement. Specimens of duralumin covered with
aluminum by the metal-spray process have been ex-
posed to salt air for a year, and are showing no
signs of deterioration.
In this connection it is interesting to note that
the bureau's experiments with aluminum-coated
duralumin have been corroborated by independent
laboratory tests. These tests were inspired by one
of the largest manufacturers of duralumin, which is
now producing sheets of the new metal on commer-
cial scale.—Compressed Air Magazine.
Safety Testing Pit
A pit which will permit the testing of the larg-
est pieces of revolving machinery at runaway speeds
with safety to the operators has just been com-
pleted at the Schenectady works of the General
Electric Company. This pit, the largest of its kind
ever constructed, will permit tests which cannot
now be duplicated anywhere else in the world. It
has been built for the purpose of running "double-
speed tests" on the rotors of water-wheel genera-
tors, from the smallest size up to huge machines
40 feet in diameter and weighing as much as 500
tons. The pit itself is a circular chamber with a
depth of 30 feet, surrounded by two concentric
walls of heavily reinforced concrete, between which
there is a cushion of soft sand. Over the top is
placed a cover 8 feet thick of reinforced concrete
and steel plate, and around the rim two ring girders
each 2i/2 feet deep. The pit is housed in a large
brick and steel building, placed in a field at a
quarter of a mile from the nearest factory build-
ing.—The Blast Furnace and Steel Plant.
Putting an End to Water Hammerx
The problem of warming up a steam system
quickly and at the same time safeguarding the pip-
ing and equipment from the destructive effects of
water hammers is one of the most annoying details
of the plant engineer's job. The conventional
method of by-passing all steam traps is effective but
involves not only the loss of considerable amount of
time and work on the part of the engineer but the
loss of considerable live steam as well.
A recently developed method made possible by
the use of so-called thermic units which provide
an automatic means of holding steam traps wide
open until steam temperatures have been estab-
lished is a much more satisfactory means in mak-
ing the morning warm-up safe and easy.
This device makes use of a thermic unit which
has been extensively used in effecting heat regu-
lated control on many kinds of apparatus. It con-
sists of a strip of metal made of laminations which
cause it to bend when it undergoes temperature
changes.
This unit is applied to the float of the steam trap
in such a manner that when the trap is cold the
laminated strips hold the valve of the trap wide
open. As soon, however, as the cold water and
air contained in the line have blown through the
open valve the temperature in the trap rises and
expansion of the laminated strip causes it to bend
so that it no longer holds the trap valve open but
permits the float and lever system of the trap to
function in the normal manner. The device is


Page 29
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
usually set so that as long as the temperature is
below 200 degrees the valve is held open while at
all temperatures above this point the trap func-
tions in the normal way.
The thermic unit is entirely contained inside the
steam trap and becomes an integral part of the
mechanism which never needs attention or adjust-
ment. Due to its simplicity the cost of the en-
tire unit is generally less than that involved in the
installation of an adequate by-pass and so in ad-
dition to the economy effected in steam saving and
saving due to the elimination of water hammer
damage as well as the saving of the engineer's time,
a distinct economy is effected both in installation
cost and operation.—Southern Power journal. o
Neir Uxc for Chromium J'latc
An application of chromium plating of large im-
portance and industrial significance has recently
been put into operation in California. At some
of the large oil refineries, steel stills of varying di-
mensions are used for cracking operations in pro-
ducing gasoline and other products. Some of these
stills are produced by the A. O. Smith Corp., Mil-
waukee, and arc in themselves unusual products.
They are understood to vary from 3 to 6 feet in di-
ameter, and some of them as long as 22 feet, and
to be made of steel plate 3 inches thick, welded elec-
trically. In the distilling operations, they must
stand very high temperatures and high pressures.
After they have been in use for some time, the
thickness of the still gradually lessens from corro-
sion until a point is reached where, for obvious rea-
sons, the pressure must be reduced and consequent-
ly the output of gasoline and other products les-
sened. It is understood that this occurs when the
stills reach a thickness of about \l/2 inches.
It is at this stage of the proceedings that chrom-
ium plating has stepped in. A number of stills,
which had been reduced in thickness to about ll/&gt;
inches, have been successfully plated inside with
chromium and their life has been decidedly in-
creased. The plating is accomplished by partly
filling the still with the electrolyte, then introduc-
ing electrodes and revolving the still during the
plating. Experience thus far has demonstrated that
the cost of chromium plating is more than offset
by the increased life of the still and the fact that
the pressure does not have to be lessened and,
therefore, the product of the still is not diminished.
The understanding is that it will be possible in
the near future to make the original stills of a thick-
ness less than 3 inches, which will be chromium
plated and used in that condition at once. This is
expected to result in a less expensive still with a
considerable longer life. It is also stated that the
carbon deposits from the cracking operations are
more easily detached from the chromium plated
steel than from the ordinary steel surface.
Those who are interested in this new develop-
ment emphasize that the field is a wide one and
are making plans to apply chromium plating on a
large scale.—The Iron Age.
Tests Indicate That Radio Woven Penetrate
Earth and Rock
Tests conducted by the United States Bureau of
Mines, Department of Commerce, in a Colorado
metal mine indicate strongly that radio waves will
penetrate 500 feet or more of rock strata. These
preliminary experiments were observed by Dr. A.
S. Eve, Director of the Department of Physics,
McGill University, Montreal, Canada, who is con-
ducting a study for the Bureau of Mines of the pos-
sibilities of various methods of geophysical pros-
pecting for the location of underground mineral
deposits.
The experiments participated in by Dr. Eve were
conducted with a superheterodyne set with nine
electron tubes in the Caribou mine of the Ameri-
can Mining and Prospecting Company, at Caribou,
Colorado. The first test was held at a depth of
220 feet, where, by means of a loop, a strong and
clear reception was obtained of a musical concert
given at Denver, 50 miles distant. The evidence
pointed strongly to the conclusion that this clear
reception was due to the penetration by the radio
waves of the solid rock strata, although there was
a remote possibility that the reception was obtained
through shafts and cross-cuts, toward which, how-
ever, the loop did not point. The nearest metal
conductors, iron rails, were 66 feet away.
The next series of experiments was conducted at
a depth of 550 feet, when "mushy" reception was
obtained from Denver. This type of reception was,
however, as good as could be obtained above ground
at the time of making the test, the night being un-
favorable for general radio reception. This series
of tests was conducted at the end of a cross-cut
reached with many turns, and 200 feet from the
main shaft. A pipe came down the shaft and fol-
lowed the tunnel up to 80 feet from the point of
observation.
In previous experiments conducted by the Bu-
reau of Mines at its Experimental Mine near Pitts-
burgh, Pa., it was at first concluded that radia-
tion and induction would penetrate rock for con-
siderable depths. Subsequent investigations have
shown that in every case the transference of radia-
tion was by some conductors in the mine, electric
wires, pipes or rails, all of which abound in mod-
ern mines.
It is possible that at Caribou the radio waves ex-
cited the conductors in the shaft, and these in turn
excited the rails and pipes, which brought the radi-

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
ation to within 70 feet of the experimenters, and
that the strong amplification of the radio apparatus
enabled the radiation to bridge the gap. This, Dr.
Eve considers, is improbable, but not impossible.
On the other hand he was impressed with the fact
that the loop did not point towards neighboring
conductors or along the tunnels, but it did point,
at both levels, within a few degrees of the source,
at Denver. The evidence is strong, but not abso-
lutely conclusive, that wireless waves will pene-
trate 500 feet of rock to an extent which enable-
them to be received with powerful amplification.
It is desirable that these investigations should be
followed by further research work on the subject.
The experiments conducted at the Caribou mine
tend to confirm the view that radiation passes
through rock with, of course, much attenuation. It
is known that radio signals will just penetrate
through a good conductor like sea water to a maxi-
mum depth of about SO or 60 feet, and there is no
reason why radiation should not penetrate to ten
times that distance through a poor conductor like
dry rock.
It is felt that further investigations should include
a comparison of the penetration of radio waves from
a distance exceeding many wave lengths, and of
radio waves generated at a distance less than .1
wave 'length.
Microbes Produce Copper
Copper is ordinarily thought of as one of our most
valuable metals won from the earth through the
skill of the miner and made into usable form by the
metallurgist; but according to a recent report of
the Department of the Interior, it now appears that
metallic copper may be deposited — in relatively
small quantities to be sure—through the action of
bacteria.
During a survey of the region near Cooke, Mont.,
by the Geological Survey, spongy masses of native
copper were found in the black muck of a bog. Sev-
eral bodies of pyritic copper ore crop out about half
a mile above the bog. This ore weathers rapidly.
and the copper is removed from it in solution as
cupric sulphate. Redeposition of the copper as na-
tive metal only in the black muck and in none of
the gravels and sands in the vicinity was ample
proof that something in the muck had caused the
precipitation of metallic copper from the sulphate
solution, but the identity of the precipitating agent
remained to be determined. Consideration of inor-
ganic processes was discouraging, but preliminary
experiments with the copper-bearing muck led to
more carefully controlled experiments which proved
beyond question that the copper was precipitated
through the agency of certain bacilli. These experi-
ments are described in some detail in Bulletin 795-C,
of the Geological Survev—"Organic Precipitation of
Metallic Copper," by T. S. Lovering.
Cast 8tonc
Considerable reconstruction of central districts in
cities and increased cost of materials have caused
architects to look beyond the materials to which
they have become accustomed to specify almost au-
tomatically, and cast stone is one of the "discover-
ies" that have resulted from the search for some-
thing that is in all respects the equal of the usual
materials but cheaper. The modern cast stone,
which is simply natural stone crushed and recon-
structed with 1'ortland cement so that it may be
shaped by the less expensive method of moulding
instead of cutting, is gaining favor with leading
architects with a reputation for conservativeness.
Doubts have been expressed as to the wearing prop-
erties of cast stone. The material is, of course, of
too recent date for comparison with natural stones
erected centuries ago, but some of the earliest cast
stone constructions are still in excellent condition.

INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS AND
THE ENGINEER
Through the improvement in organization and in
productive methods rendered industry by techni-
cally trained men, marked increases in industrial
efficiency have been brought about. In the steel
industry, for instance, two men with modern un-
loading machinery have replaced 12 to 20 unload-
ing by hand; in blast furnace charging two men
using machinery do the work of 14; in pig iron
casting seven men accomplish what 60 formerly
could do, and in the unloading of scrap and pig
two men with great electric magnets and travel-
ling cranes get done in a day as much as 128
working under old methods.
Greater productive capacity exists in virtually
every industry—in textile, tire, steel, oil. shoe,
leather and others. Herbert Hoover has estimated
that while the number of wage earners in Ameri-
can factories increased 27 per cent in the last 10
years, their output, in terms of quantity, increased
nearly 60 per cent. Production per wage earner
employed has advanced by at least 25 per cent.
These figures are indicative of a great new trend
•—the flow of technical knowledge, from the engi-
neer and scientist,"to business and industry. In-
creased production has come about very largely
through the adaptation by the engineer of research
in pure science to practical needs.
How has this new knowledge—these new meth-
ods—reached the business man? In two important
ways this new technique has spread to the in-
dustrial world. Where size and resources have
permitted, business has set up its own laboratories


Page 31
THE M ICHIGAN TECHNIC
and engaged its own staff of scientists and tech-
nicians. Or, this knowledge has been sccured
through the medium of hooks, scientific journals,
the reports of technical societies and their bulletins
•ind publications.
This latter is important for two reasons. First,
every industry cannot maintain its own laboratory
and staff of engineers. Secondly, a wide diffusion
of knowledge is constantly necessary to avoid
costly duplication of research and assure to indus-
try as a whole the benefits of the latest and best
scientific knowledge.
A valuable channel for this dissemination is the
American public library. Indeed, one of the prin-
cipal directions of recent library growth has been
in the development of science, technology and eco-
nomics departments. The John Crerar Library in
Chicago, for instance, is one of the foremost in-
dustrial libraries in the United States today. The
Newark Public Library has established a down-
town business branch. And the libraries in Cleve-
land, Detroit, New York and other cities are en-
gaged in the work of becoming valuable connecting
links between business and scientific knowledge.
Concerning the library and its relation to new
scientific truths, the late Professor Jacques Loeb,
an outstanding American scientist, has said that
most scientific discoveries are made in libraries and
then are tested out in laboratories. "New discov-
eries are combinations of old ideas, and those com-
binations are most likely to occur to the mind of
scientist and engineer, not when handling material
rhings, but when brooding over the thoughts of
other men and rethinking them again." It is in
these hours of profound reflection that new com-
binations occur, and the laboratory verifies or dis-
proves. "The library," said Professor Loeb, "re-
mains the great essential to discovery."
Yet despite the rapidity with which the engineer
;-nd his contributions have been utilized by indus-
try and business, there exists today, unapplied and
of times unknown, vast aggregations of technical
knowledge.
Engineers have asserted that technical knowl-
edge is available which would go a long way to-
ward the abolition of poverty, double or treble the
standard of living, change ugly cities into noble
ones, and by the means of giant power and de-
centralization bring the culture of the town to tin.
countryside.
Fully one-half of the million man-years lost every
year through industrial accidents could be saved,
it is estimated, if our engineering knowledge were
generally known and applied.
Much technical knowledge must, of course, re-
main unused for a considerable period of time, for
its application would mean the scrapping of many
hrge industrial units. Application must come about
gradually. Yet there is a danger, too, that valu-
able technical knowledge which might be imme-
diately useful will remain buried in brochures,
locked in laboratory reports or stand on shelves
unknown. Progress in industry rests not only upon
the creation of new knowledge but also upon its
diffusion.
Engaged in a general program for the spread of
knowledge is the American Library Association,
a national body of 8,400 libraries, librarians and
allied organizations throughout the country.
It is engaged in bringing industry and business
into closer contact with the sources of technical
information. Its program includes the establish-
ment and development of science, technology and
economics divisions in the public library.
Its knowledge and experience in all the rami-
fications of library work is placed at the disposal
of corporations, of business and scientific organi-
zations. The association is engaged in pointing out
the growing technical resources of the public li-
brary and the many sources of technical infor-
mation to which it holds a key. It is endeavoring
to make the public library a vital medium between
science and industry.
Such a program will require, however, the co-
operation of the engineer, of business and industry,
for its accomplishment. The association, whose
headquarters are at 86 East Randolph street, Chi-
cago, asks, therefore, that all organizations and
publications concerned in decreasing the actual
phvsical burden upon the American people, in the
dimunition of the average hours of labor and an
increase in the standards of American living, co-
operate with it in this work. o
THE COVER DESIGN
The cover design for this issue of The Michigan
Technic is a charcoal sketch by Mr. Frederick How-
ard Aldrich, instructor in Freehand Drawing in the
College of Architecture. The subject is one of the
main entrance to the new Museum, now being com-
pleted at the corner of North University and Wash-
tenaw avenues.
Mr. Aldrich's work has appeared in many of the
leading art exhibitions throughout the country and
is remarkable for the effects produced in the simple
light and shade. The method used in this drawing
is what is known as the Rub drawing. Silhouette
and value in this process are very effective, and the
idea of light and shade balances throughout the
picture. Particular attention is called to the good
finding of proportion in this design.
The Technic is very fortunate in being able to
secure such excellent material for its cover illus-
tration, and wishes to thank Mr. Aldrich for his
contribution.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
THE COLLEGE CHRONICLE
Items of Interest to Michigan Engineers
Addition* to the Engineering College
Teaching 8tnff
The past year brought about few changes in the
personnel of the Engineering College teaching staff,
there having been five resignations and as many ap-
pointments.
With the resignation of Prof. A. H. Blanchard.
Professor of Highway Engineering and Highway
Transportation, the college lost one of its most ac-
tive and capable men. Prof. Blanchard, being very
widely experienced in his line of work did much
toward raising the Highway Engineering Depart-
ment to its present high standing. Not only was
he active in university work, but he was equally
active in engineering circles throughout the state.
He is now. a consulting engineer with offices in To-
ledo, Ohio.
Other members of last year's staff who resigned
are: Mr. M. L. Carroll, Instructor in Modern Lan-
guages; Mr. Bernard F. Dostal, Instructor in Engi-
neering Mathematics; Mr. J. C. McCalmont, In-
structor in Naval Architecture, and Mr. G. B. Wat-
kins, Instructor in Chemical Engineering. o
The Department of Engineering Mechanics is ex-
ceptionally fortunate in securing the services of
Prof. Stephen P. Timoshenko, who is an engineer
of considerable repute in the field of mechanics.
Prof. Timoshenko was born in Russia in 1879.
He received his advanced academic training in the
Petrograd Polytechnic Institute, from which insti-
tution he graduated in 1901. After three years of
instructorship in the Petrograd Institute he became
professor of mathematics at Kiev Polytechnic In-
stitute. While at Kiev his doctor's dissertation was
published and was very favorably received. He re-
mained in the institutes of Petrograd and Kiev until
1920 when he became a professor in a polytechnic
school in Jugo Slavia.
During the World War he was for five years a
consulting engineer for the Russian navy and for
the Department of Communication. At this time he
was also a member of the Special Committee on
Stresses in Railway Track, and of the Committee
on Stresses in Bridges at the Departments of Ways
of Communication.
Prof. Timoshenko has written some thirty books
and papers on different theories of vibrations,
stresses, and strains. Several of these papers have
been translated into other languages, and have re-
ceived wide recognition among engineers and ma-
thematicians.
Prof. Timoshenko came to the United States as
the result of a paper on the theory of vibrations,
which attracted the attention of an American con-
cern. Of late he has been a member of the engi-
neering staff of the Westinghouse Electric &amp; Man-
ufacturing Co. While with this company he served
as a research engineer in stress analysis and vibra-
tion problems.
o
This year's Civil Engineering teaching staff has
been strengthened by the appointment of Prof. W.
J. Emmons, who will succeed Prof. Morrison to the
State Highway Laboratories. Prof. Emmons is -i
graduate of Brown Universitv. He received his
Master's Degree from Columbia. Since his gradu-
ation Prof. Emmons has had many years of prac-
tical experience in highway engineering. As a result
of his college work and his practical experience, he
will be a very valuable addition to the faculty as
an associate professor of highway engineering.
Mr. Gordon W. Harrison, I'h. 1'.., comes to Michi-
gan from De Pauw University. After attending
Alma College, Mr. Harrison received his Bachelor's
Degree at the University of Chicago. He was a
member of the U. S. Army during the war. Mr.
Harrison will act as an instructor in the Modern
Language Department.
Civil Engineering Drnnrtment Note*
Although the Civil Engineering Department is
one of the oldest and best established departments
in the Engineering College, it has never become
self-satisfied. It is continually making improve-
ments which give a greater field of activity for both
the undergraduate and the research-bent graduate.
The department has been especially active in re-
search during the year. An experimental electrical
transmission line has been erected outside of Ann
Arbor. The purpose of this line is the study of the
stresses and strains set up in cables by varying at-
mospheric conditions. The department has also
been busv in other fields of research.


Page 33
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Prof. Roger L. Morrison has severed connections
with the State Highway Laboratories and is now
devoting his entire time to teaching and research
work in highway engineering and highway trans-
portation.
Prof. John S. Worley is now giving his undivided
attention to the affairs of the Transportation De-
partment. Under his able direction the Transpor-
tation Library has grown in size and importance,
until it has been found necessary to change its lo-
cation. It is now situated in a room on the first floor
of the East Engineering Building. The librarv con-
tains volumes on nearly every conceivable phase of
transportation, and is considered to be one of the
best of its kind. Every engineering student ought
to make the acquaintance of both the library and
its able champion, Prof. Worley.
Professors King and Wisler have just completed
and published a revised edition of their text book
on Hydraulics.
K. 0. T. C.
The R. O. T. C. unit is still busily engaged in
turning out men of warring instincts. The several
changes that it experienced this year does not seem
to retard either the speed or the quality of pro-
duction.
Capt. G. W. Dunn, Jr. has been transferred to a
post in Panama. In the few years that Capt. Dunn
had been at the university he made many friends
among the students.
Lieut. J. H. Madison, in charge of instruction in
the Coast Artillery unit, is filling the vacancy left
by Capt. Dunn.
Lieut. Madison studied mining engineering at
the Colorado School of Mines, later entered the
United States Military Academy and was graduated
from that institution in November, 1918.
Eollowing a tour of inspection of the European
battlefields he was assigned to study as a student
at the Coast Artillery School, Fort Monroe, Va., in
1919. His service since then has been at Fort Casey,
Wash., various posts in the Hawaiian Department,
and during the last year, at the Coast Artillery
School, where he has completed a further course of
study.
Due to the insufficient number of students en-
rolled in the Coast Artillery unit of the K. O. T. C.,
it is expected that this unit will be discontinued
next fall. The students now enrolled may transfer
to any of the other departments of the R. O. T. C.
Chemical Engineering Deportment Notes
As usual the Chemical Engineering Department
is plunged deeply into a vast amount of research
work, much of which has not been completed to an
extent which will permit a description of the re-
sults.
Prof. Brier has started research work in the field
of paints and varnishes. Although it is just started,
it is beginning to shape itself into a very interesting
piece of work.
Prof. G. G. Brown has been engaged in research
work for the past year and a half on natural gaso-
line. Natural gasoline is a very' volatile product
obtained from natural gas. At present, between
fourteen and fifteen per cent of all the gasoline used
is natural gasoline. A small percentage of this gaso-
line mixed with other gasoline produces a very no-
ticeable increase in the ease of starting a car and
of accelerating it when started.
There are nearly as many graduate students in
the Chemical Engineering Department as there are
seniors, there being about twenty working for their
Master's Degree, and as many more working for
their Doctor's Degree. The reason for this becomes
evident when one considers that the possessors of
such degrees usually obtain higher and more re-
sponsible positions with increased opportunity for
advancement than the possessors of just a B. S.
Degree.
Freshman Week
According to all reports Freshman Week was a
noteworthy success. Nearly all of the first year men
were at the university on time, so that everything
went smoothly from the start. The spirit in which
the Freshmen participated was excellent. This was
particularly true of the Engineers. They entered
into the thing with a friendly, good-natured, inten-
sive zest which created an atmosphere appropriate
for such an occasion.
The schedule, being rather intense, kept the men
busy the entire week. With its varied assortment
of lectures, tests, trips, free shows and luncheons,
the program did not allow them time in which to
become dejected or homesick. It initiated them
to college life with activity and friendliness show-
ing them that the university was greatly interested
in them. It acted as an intermediate between the
incoming Freshman's ideas of college life and ac-
tual college life, correcting erroneous ideas and pre-
senting new ones. As a result of this program the
class of '31 was matriculated into the university
thoroughly informed and unbewildered.
The faculty advisers for the Engineering Fresh-
men had been chosen the Spring before, and had
made many plans for the instruction and entertain-
ment of their groups. In all cases the advisers re-
ported that the spirit of their groups ran high, which
demonstrates the mutual interest and co-operation
between the advisers and the individual members
of their respective groups.
The Freshman Engineers had several assemblies
in which prominent members of the Engineering
College teaching staff addressed them. These as-


November, 1927
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
semblies were also given over to the discussion of
the problems of the class as a whole, personal prob-
lems being discussed in the advisory groups. The
assemblies tended to give the class a definite state
of organization, a uniform spirit, and an acquaint-
ance with the members of the teaching staff.
Freshman Week was a success both from the fac-
ulty and the student viewpoint, because of the per-
sonal contacts made, the spirit of friendliness cre-
ated, and the solution of mutual and personal prob-
lems executed.
ering of fellows who like to air their views on prob-
lems of common interest. Incidentally they are se-
curing practice in thought and its expression while
standing before an audience.
Mechanical Engineering Department
The Mechanical Engineering Department has not
experienced any notable changes either in faculty
or equipment. The department has been carrying
on considerable research in different phases of me-
chanical engineering. The Automotive Laboratory
has been running tests on its new universal engine.
The engine threatened to ruin both the Automotive
Lab. and the auditory senses of anyone in its im-
mediate vicinity. These difficulties were overcome
by putting it on a special eradle, and by connecting
it to a twenty-foot exhaust muffler. So Prof. Lay
can now run the engine without fear of awaking
the students from their daily slumbers.
The Transportation Club
As the result of the increasing interest in trans-
portation on the part of both the students and the
faculty, the idea of forming a Transportation Club
was conceived. After due time, this idea came to
a head in the form of a lively, enjoyable meeting
which was held on Thursday, October 20. At this
meeting the-purpose of the club was outlined and
officers were elected.
The officers elected were: P. M. Shoemaker,
'28 E, president; W. If. Heath, '28 E, vice-president,
and D. L. Allen, '28 Lit., secretary and treasurer.
The purpose of the club as outlined, is to present
problems and phases of past, present, and future
transportation. It is hoped that the club will be
able to secure prominent leaders in transportation
work, who will give talks on up-to-the-minute topics
on transportation.
The Engineering Debating Society
The Engineering Debating Society, a club open
to the class of '30 and all succeeding classes in the
Engineering Colleges, has had several meetings this
year. The society expects to show a substantial in-
crease both in numbers and in popularity. The club
has several unique programs planned for the neat-
future, which if executed ought to be both enter-
taining and instructive. This society is not a stiff,
formal gathering of powerful elocutionists, but
rather an active, direct thinking, semi-formal gath-

The national convention of Tau Beta Pi was held
at Columbus during the week of October 9th. The
convention was attended by several members of the
Engineering College faculty, three of whom were
elected to national offices. Prof. A. D. Moore again
returned with the presidential honors, and, inciden-
tally, with its many responsibilities. Prof. H. H.
Higbie was elected vice president, and Prof. C. T.
Johnston was elected to the office of counsellor.
The convention definitely urged that the Alumni
put into operation a plan for the granting of fel-
lowships. It is expected that within the next five
years, there will be fifteen fellowships of $600 each.
These fellowships will be granted each year to
worthy students who have completed a four-year
course in engineering.

all his laws based on metric units making it nec-
essary to convert other units to the metric sys-
tem in order to make them useful. In his engineer-
ing courses he finds exactly the reverse is true
and all that he learned in physics must be modified
to fit a new system. In electrical engineering all
the laws of electricity are based on the metric sys-
tem while the mechanical laws of motors and other
apparatus are based on the English system. It
is not necessary to enumerate further the mixed
up conglomeration which makes up the American
engineer's system of units today. What might be
more forcibly brought out is this; is such a system
as this necessary? Certainly it is not. It is ac-
tually discouraging to think that a profession which
has advanced as far as engineering has advanced is
still retarding its own progress while in other
countries the more popular system was long ago
adopted. America and the British commonwealth
are the only countries today that exist on a double
standard.
Certainly the engineering field is not the only
place where our double standard retards progress.
In every line of activity where a system of measure
is necessary we find America and England at odds
with the rest of the world. However it is in the
field of engineering that a start toward standard-
izing America can best be made.
The physicists, being a group more or less or-
ganized through similar lines of progress, long ago
threw away the old drag and whole-heartedly ac-
cepted the new system. In unorganized groups the
change is affected less easily. The engineers do,
however, comprise a group nearly as well organ-
ized as the physicists and consequently the next
step should be in the engineering field.
Such a change, of course, cannot be brought
about over night. It means much effort on the
part of all concerned. Books and tables must all
be revised in order to give place to the better
system, however all this can be accomplished in
such a more or less informally organized group if
the correct steps are taken. If the leaders of en-
gineering education would take the matter in hand
the process would be a short one so far as the en-
gineers themselves are concerned. Furthermore
the writers of books dealing in engineering subjects
and the manufacturers of America are catering to
the engineers. They are using the English system
today, not because they believe it to be best, but
because the engineers demand it, and if the engi-
neers see fit to use the metric system their demands
will be as quickly cared for as they are at pres-
ent.
Milwaukee Generator tiets Record
The Milwaukee Electric Railway and Light Co.
has installed a steam turbine generator that uses
steam at a pressure of 1200 pounds per square inch,
superheated to 720 degrees F. It exhausts at 320
pounds pressure, the steam being conducted at this
pressure to the station mains serving several other
generating units, where more of its energy is ex-
tracted. Final exhaust is at one inch absolute pres-
sure. This pressure of 1200 pounds is between
three and four times the average pressure of gen-
erating plants, and, with one exception, double the
pressure in use at any station. The one exception
is the 3,000 kilowatt turbine generator in the Edger
station of the Edison Electric Illuminating Co. of
Boston, which also operates at 1200 pounds pres-
sure. The Milwaukee machine sets a record, how-
ever, in that it has a capacity of 7,000 kilowatts—
more than twice that of the Edison unit. Both
units are of General Electric design and manufac-
ture. A pressure of 400 pounds per square inch is
now common in central stations, with some oper-
ating above this figure, but 600 pounds is believed
to be the maximum except in the cases mentioned.

Echoes from the Graduates
FRANK W STEERE
By E. R, NELL, '29E
FRANK W. STEERE of New York, vice-
president and general manager of the Semet-
Solvay Engineering Corporation, was elected
president of the Michigan Gas Association at the
closing session of its annual convention, July 7, at
the Grand Hotel, Mackinac Island. Mr. Steere was
advanced from the office of vice-president in ac-
cordance with an established custom.
The above paragraph
contains no errors in names
or places; a New York citi-
zen has been elected to the
presidency of a Michi-
gan association represent-
ing one of its biggest in-
dustries. The reasons be-
h i n d the announcement
constitute an unusual bi-
ography and a story of sci-
e n t i f i c and commercial
progress in an important
field of utility service.
Fifteen years ago, at the
age of 27 years, Frank
Steere was finishing his
student days at Ann Arbor.
The opportunity to enter
college came a little late,
but he made up for lost
time. While in school he attacked some of the re-
search problems confronting engineers at that time.
One of these was an electrical process for detarring
gas. He worked out a principle of his own under
the guidance of Professor Alfred H. White, and
the resulting apparatus was set up in the plant of
the Washtenaw Gas Company at Ann Arbor.
Two years after his graduation as a chemical en-
gineer in 1912 he appeared before the American Gas
Institute, now the American Gas Association, and
read a paper on his detarring process, which in-
spired considerable discussion. His thesis so im-
pressed the Institute that he was awarded the Beal
Gold Medal, presented annually to the individual
who brings to the sessions the paper of greatest
significance to the gas industry as a whole.
\
FRANK W. STEERE
Frank Steere's first job after leaving college was
with the Semet-Solvay Company's by-product coke
plant in Detroit. It was here that he had his first
intensive training in large scale gas production and
its problems. He had a great opportunity to con-
tinue his investigations in a generally neglected
field of gas operating practice.
Shortly after completing his work with the Semet-
Solvay Company he went
II to the Ford plant at High-
land Park to study and im-
prove, if possible, the heat
treating methods. At that
time a series of oil-burning
furnaces were used. They
covered considerable
ground and required stor-
age space for the forging,-
to cool between the succes-
sive steps of the process.
The layout was cumber-
some and did not fit into
the Ford idea, then being
developed, of progressive
production and assemblv
along a conveyor. With
this problem before him.
Frank Steere designed and
built the first double re-
generative type of furnace. The principle was new
to the Ford engineers, and when the furnace was
built the general sentiment was that when Steere
lit it up they didn't want any of their employees to
be within reach of the debris that would follow the
explosion. On the day that Steere's furnace was
ready for its first test everybody left the building.
But it didn't blow up. The furnace behaved just as
it should have behaved. It delivered a terrific white
heat such as had not been obtained in existing
types. The pipe that carried off the waste gases
was never more than warm, so efficiently did the
regenerators retain and utilize the heat that was
developed.
Steere's heat treating furnace established the
merit of gas fuel for an exacting industrial opera-


Page 37

tion. With oil there was no temperature control;
with gas, the temperature desired by the engineers
could be obtained accurately and exactly as needed.
The new process lent itself to cheap handling, which
was the whole secret of the Ford manufacturing
policy, then being developed.
In 1914 Frank Steere formed the Steere Engi-
neering Company whose purpose was to build gas
cleaning and condensing equipment, From a mod-
est beginning, the company had a development
which was closely linked with the advances in gas
making methods. Two years out of college, head
of his own company, visioning the opportunities
for improving methods in gas plant practice by
simple application of principles then only partly
understood, Steere began making things for gas
men. He was unhampered by any prejudices or
any notions that the established order would remain
the same.
The new company grew steadily and in 1916 it
bought the Lloyd Construction Company of Detroit,
a concern of long standing in gas equipment manu-
facture. At this time Steere built the Dohcrty
Washer Cooler for the gas industry, and construct-
ed it of welded steel, an innovation in the gas in-
dustry. This welding was done with acetylene
torches; later when the General Electric Company
developed their electric welding process it was in
the Steere shops that it received its most severe
operating tests and conditions. The results of these
tests went far to enable electric welding to reach
the prominent place it occupies today.
In the archives of the Steere Company are some
interesting accounts of experiences in "selling" the
welded equipment "idea" to the gas industry. The
Miami (Florida) Gas Company needed a purifier.
The Steere Company offered to build one of welded
steel. The Gas Company refused to consider the
"new fangled idea" unless the Steere Company
would guarantee to replace the installation if a
tornado should rise out of the sea and waft it
away; the guarantee was given. The job was fin-
ished, and the men who directed the work went on
their vacations. When they returned from the syl-
van recesses where they had taken their fishing
tackle, the first thing that met their eyes was a
newspaper headline blaring out the destruction
done by the Miami hurricane. Anxious question-
ing revealed that the hundred-mile wind had moved
a cover a few feet when something had struck
against it. The welded job resisted the tornado.
It removed any lingering doubts about the strength
of welded steel.
Another outstanding contribution was the devel-
opment of the Backrun Process. Since 1923, when
it was introduced, it has revolutionized the manu-
facture of water-gas. The Backrun Process was
conceived and patented by D. J. Young, a consult-
ing engineer of Tacoma, Washington. He devel-
oped the idea of taking superheated steam and pass-
ing it backward thru the carburetor and genei
ator of a water-gas machine, making gas on the re-
verse operation, while at the same time preserv-
ing for gas making, valuable heat that formerly
went through the stack and was lost. The im-
proved heat balance which it gave and the account
of the reversed steam on the fuel and the brick-
work improved every step in water-gas operation.
After its introduction and complete acceptance by
all manufacturers of water-gas, it was a natural
step for the Steere Company to begin building them.
This machine has always been regarded by the gas
plant operator as equipment nominal in price and
useful chiefly for reserve capacity and to meet
excess demand. A large capacity can be developed
on short notice and then the machine may be shut,
down if desired. Coal gas has always been de-
pended upon for "the backbone" of the supply. Un-
der steady operation, the water-gas machine needs
to be taken out of production periodically in order
to reline the shells with brick and to remove
clinker. These obstacles to satisfactory, continu-
ous operation did not impress Steere as perma-
nent inescapable conditions of water-gas operation.
The backrun had already reduced the destructive
action of carbon and fused ash on brick lining,
when the steam driving backward through the .ma-
chine carried these deposits to the fuel bed before
they could fasten to the checker bricks and side
walls. Steere's study of fuel-bed conditions re-
vealed that the high heats which were necessary for
the machine to function had a tendency to make un-
equal conditions in the fuel-bed that greatly re-
duced the machine's usefulness. The Steere charg-
ing machine was first developed; it took coal from
the hoppers and by a simple mechanical control
placed it exactly where needed and in correct quan-
tity in the generator. That made for a fuel-bed
of uniform depth. The problem of varying density
had yet to be eliminated. In the center of the fuel
bed was a thick mass of coal, which along the walls
the coal burned freely. Thus the blasts which were
to carry this heat through the machine were pre-
vented from functioning evenly. The Steere grate
poker, a hydraulically operated pillar of heat-re-
sisting metal solved the problem. It was built un-
der a specially designed grate and whenever things
became clogged up in the fuel bed, the operator, by
the turn of a lever sent the poker plunging its way
through the clinkers, blow holes, black centers, and
back again leaving behind a uniformly burning fire.
Originality and resourcefulness, combined with
administrative ability brought recognition to the
Steere Engineering Company. At the close of 1926,
just 12 years after it was organized, it had more
than 300 persons on its payroll and was growing
steadily, then came the next step.


November, 1927
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The Allied Chemical and Dye corporation of New
York decided that it wanted to put on the market
the gas making and refining equipment which had
been developed to a point of high efficiency by one
of its subsidiaries, the Semet-Solvay Company.
This company had built a number of by-product
coke oven plants, many for its own organization to
operate, selling gas for city consumption, coke for
blast furnaces and disposing of ammonia, tar and
light oils to their respective markets. Someone was
needed to take over and lead the construction or-
ganization and develop it into a great industry; so
it came about that the Stecre Engineering Com-
pany was bought by the Allied Chemical and Dye
Corporation and the Semet-Solvay Engineering
Corporation was organized. Steere was made vice-
president. It is an index of his administrative cali-
.bre that his entire Michigan organization moved to
New York with him. The records and equipment
of the Steere company were loaded into express
cars one week end late in January, 1927, and moved
into the heart of New York's financial district. Busi-
ness as usual was transacted on the Monday morn-
ing after the move was made.
For the past decade, Frank Steere has been in
constant demand to appear on the programs of gas
associations over the country to discuss and ex-
plain the things he was developing. He has read
papers before the American Gas Association, Soci-
ety of Chemical Industry, American Chemical So-
ciety and many others, besides contributing to
many technical publications and studies. So thor-
oughly have some of his business seeking bulletins
gone into the subjects that were created for dis^
cussion that some of them have been used for ref-
erence books in technical schools.
It may not be surprising therefore, that with such
a constructive force in the gas industry in Michi-
gan, that the Michigan Gas Association, made up
of operators of gas companies, would desire Frank
Steere to become its president for a year, in rec-
ognition of his contributions to the industry. At
the 1926 convention he was made vice-president.
It is the custom to advance this officer each year
which meant that he was due to be elected presi-
dent in July, 1927. During the year between the
two meetings came the move which took him out
of the state. He left with the association the de-
cision as to whether he should retain his office.
The membership was canvassed and was unanimous
in its desire that he serve his term as president.
He was a favorite son and once a favorite son in
Michigan, always a favorite son. Wherefore it
may be recorded that all official communication to
the Michigan Gas Association requiring the atten-
tion of its president should be addressed to Frank
W. Steere, New York City.
As to his personal attributes, they can be briefly
summed up. He has three hobbies, his family, his
work and his farm. Back in Michigan on "Wat-
kin's Lake, Oakland County, is a little country es-
tate just about large enough for nine golf holes
which will never be found. Where bunkers might
bloom or divots be replaced is a field of wheat and
a garden and a playground for two reg'lar fellers
and their sister.
After fifteen years of working at one thing, one
may be pardoned if enthusiasm cools a little. There
is no indication at present that Frank Steere is
losing any of the enthusiasm which has carried him
this far. He has visions of a gas industry far out-
stripping the one that exists today.
The great future for the gas industry, he believes,
is in the development of industrial gas. The prob-
lem as Steere visions it is the development of ap-
pliances for absolutely every heating process in in-
dustry, making and employing gas on a basis that
will be cheaper than any competitive fuel. He is
convinced that it can be done and it will be done
very soon by somebody. He believes that enough
is known today about manufacturing processes to
take care of all problems of gas supply. The devel-
opments will come, he predicts, in the design of ap-
pliances of many kinds and in the aggressive fight
for the business that righly belongs to gas, the
most perfect of all fuels.

Undiscovered
country in industry
THE globe's surface no longer
holds much undiscovered country,
but the pioneer-minded man can still
find plenty of it in industry—partic-
ularly in the telephone industry.
In the Bell telephone companies
throughout the entire country, men
are now exploring the 1930's and
40's and 50's, charting the probable
trend of population and the require-
ments for service.
In research and operation, and in
telephone manufacture as well, the
Bell System takes seriously its respon-
sibility to give adequate service now
and to gird itself for a long future.

considered the outstanding ex-
ponent of research. Germany
has long been considered the
leader in this field, with Eng-
land a close second. Without
doubt, this observation has
been in general correct, as re-
search never comes to the fore
in any country until the atten-
tion of capital is attracted
with regard to the economic
utilization of raw materials.
The United States was es-
sentially an agricultural na-
tion until the civil war. Since
then, it has become an indus-

fundamental studies in natural
sciences. Others think of it in
terms of a new development

sales and production. For in-
stance, we have such an organ-
ization as the Copper and
Brass Research Association. A
large share of the national ex-
penditures of this association
were devoted to advertising, al-
though at this writing larger
and larger expenditures are
being made available for ac-
tivities that are looked upon as
research. The United States

criticised for not engaging
more extensively in research.

by no means reached a state of depletion, yet,

ber of the development activities, he states that

directly required a total force of 2115 employees.
It is now generally known that the corporation
contemplates proceeding on a more extensive pro-
gram of research and to this end they have ap-
pointed a director of research.
The automobile industry has also been criticised
for its failure to support research. Here, again.
we must define what we mean by research before
we can reach an}- conclusion with regard to the
accuracy of the charge. If we
consider research only from
the angle of the procurement
of fundamental data, there will
be some justification. If we
look upon research as involv-
ing not only procurement of
fundamental data, but prosecu-
tion of a comprehensive devel-
opment program as wejl, then
we must come to the conclu-
sion that the automobile indus-
try has not been negligent in
its research activities. It
seems logical to view research
from the latter aspect as de-
marcation between that which
constitutes development activ-
ities and that w h i c h consti-
tutes activities performed for
the sole purpose for obtaining fundamental data
are not sharp.
It is true that our universities are not occupying
the same pre-eminent position in research which
they did a decade or more ago. This has been
due to the fact that certain industries have found
it necessary to engage in research on a large scale
in order to expand and grow. The American Tele-
phone and Telegraph Company, the General Elec-
tric Company, the Westinghouse Electric and Man-
ufacturing Company, the General Motors Corpora-
tion, the dul'ont Industries and a host of others
are examples of this type. The American Tele-
phone and Telegraph Company maintain a research
staff of over 3000 and operate on a budget of over
$8.000.000 annually. In the State of Michigan such
organizations as the General Motors Corporation,
the Edison Company, Parke-Davis Company, Pack-
ard Motor Car Company, I'ostum Cereal Com-
pany and many others are engaged in research ac-
tivities involving annual expenditures of several
hundred thousand dollars and a number are en-
gaged in research activities involving annual ex-
penditures of over a million dollars. Although our
universities have not expanded their research activ-
ities in recent years to the same extent that those
of industry have been expanded, it is the judgment
of the writer that a new era for research is before
our universities. There is a greater interest in re-

WHITE, head of the De-

search, is, by virtue of his own
personal experience, one of the
best authorities on the status
of engineering research, both

scribed quite fundamentally
what the future research man

~i
search today in our universities than ever before
and a greater appreciation of the fact that adequate
research programs must be supported.
In the University of Michigan part of this ex-
pression has taken the form of a Department of
Engineering Research, the development of which
is being watched with keen interest not only by
those directly connected with the University an&lt;]
industrial leaders of the state but also by sister in-
stitutions throughout the coun-
try. The growth of this de-
partment within recent years
has been most gratifying. Due
to the loyal support which th-j
department has received from
the University itself and from
those industries which h a v e
brought certain of their prob-
lems to it, last year a total of
$142,250.19 was expended for
research, involving work on
140 projects, 90 of which were
completed with w o r k still in
progress on the remainder.
This program i n v o 1 v e d the
services of 161 persons, of
which 15 were full time, not
counting clerks, students and
mechanics and the part-time
services of 54 members of the faculty.
Although the expenditures for this program are
not large in comparison with the research expen-
ditures of some of the industrial organizations
above mentioned, it is still a most creditable show-
ing when viewed from the standpoint of similar
activities in the other universities and colleges in
the country. The most pleasing aspects of the
department's growth, however, arc the fact that
the activities are increasing at a very rapid rate
and the further fact that the problems which are
being brought to the University are of much larger
calibre and scope than was formerly the case.
For instance, the Michigan Gas Association, which
has. hitherto, made available but $1000 per year
has increased its allotment for the present year
to $10,000.
When the Department was first established there
was a general feeling that research problems would
be brought to the University because of the phy-
sical equipment. This has not been the case. They
have been brought because of a feeling of confi
dence in the men to whom the work was entrusted.
Research is not a matter of physical equipment,
although equipment is a very necessary item for
the proper conduction of research, it is a matter of
brain power. All physical equipment would be ab-

THE SIGNAL CORPS of the army is con-
cerned primarily with signal communica-
tion service. Its mission both in peace an(l

needs the telephone, tel-
egraph, radio, panels,
pyrotechnics, pigeons,
lamps, and the messen-
ger who takes the dis-
p a t c h e s personally to
their destination.
These agencies un-
practically n ev er all
available at the same
time, but the technical
development of all agen-
cies is of first impor-
tance. Since the World
War development proj-
ects on most of these
subjects have been un-
dertaken and carried
through t o completion
and steady progress is
shown in improved de-
si gn and operation of
mechanical and electri-
cal equipment.
In the field of radio
considerable work has
been done. Radio beacons are being found to
be tremendously valuable to air navigation
and a project involving the development of such
a beacon has recently been completed by the Sig-
nal Corps of the army. It is known as an inter
locking equisignal beacon. It is based on
the well k n o w n directional effect of the loop
antenna. A receiving set equipped with a loop
antenna will receive best from stations toward

would be obtained. If a similar loop is connected
to a transmitting set, the loop will radiate most
strongly in the direction in which it is pointing
and not at all at right angles to it. Therefore, any
receiver moved at a constant distance and in a cir-
cle around the transmit-
ter will pick up signals
at the maximum intens-
ity when the loop of the
receiver is in the same
plane as the loop of the
transmitter. The follow-
ing is quoted from an ar-
ticle on the subject by
C a p t a i n William H.
Murphy in t h e Signal
Corps Bulletin for De-
cember:
"Now let us employ
two loops at a certain
point set up at a defi-
nite angle between them.
Let one loop point 30
degrees west of north
and the other 30 degrees
east of north as shown
in figure 2.
"We can then say the
two loops differ in posi-
tion by an obtuse angle
of 120 degrees. If a re-
ceiver on the ground or
in an airplane were lo-
cated at the point 33 cor-
responding to a bearing 330 degrees, then signals
from the left loop would be at their maximum
while signals from the right loop would only be
half as strong. A Morse N or Morse code sent
out by the left loop would be much stronger than
a Morse A or Morse code sent out by the right
loop, it being understood that the loops would be
transmitted alternately. Suppose next that our
receiver were located at the point 21, correspond-
which the loop is pointing and stations at right ing to 210 degrees, then the Morse A signal from
angles to the direction of the loop will not
be heard. The change from best reception to zero
reception is of course gradual. If the varying
intensity of the signal were plotted in proportion
the right loop would be louder than the Morse N
from the left loop. Suppose finally that the re-
ceiver, owing to the stronger A signals being re-
ceived, were moved northward until the point 27
to the intensity of the signal a figure eight or co- were reached, that is until it was directly west of
sine characteristic of the form shown in figure 1 the transmitter, then on comparing the two figure

8 characteristics we would find that the two sig-
nals would now be equally strong, as the lines ai
and aj are of the same length.
"It is easy to visualize just which signals an ob-
server in an airplane would hear louder if he were
north or south of the true course and to know
what direction he would have to follow in order
FIGURE 1
to arrive on the true course and to remain on the
same. It is obvious that the more accurately the
pilot can determine the equality of such alternate
signals the more nearly true a course he can fly;
also that no apparatus will be needed other than
a receiving set capable of being tuned to the wave
length of the signals.
"The cquisignal line is a great circle line and is,
of course, not affected by wind. A pilot following
such an indicated line will, therefore, automatical-
ly compensate for drift, and will automatically fly
the shortest route between two terminals without
any calculations whatsoever. As a matter of fact,
flights made by means of the beacon over cloud
layers were entirely accurate and were in turn used
to determine the wind drift by the simple expe-
dient of noting the change in earth-inductor con-
troller setting required in order to bring the in-
dicator to zero. The beacon and compass can and
should supplement one another, although flights
without the aid of compass or map are entirelv
possible and practicable. It i.s further possible
for the pilot to leave the true course in order to
avoid storm areas or to follow through mountain
passes and then to return to the true course again,
and this has been done frequently.
"The accuracy of determining changes in signal
intensity being most important, it was necessary
to devise aids for the observer. At first alternate
parts of the two Morse signals were loosely inter-
locked, so that when equality of signals had been
obtained an X or -- . . -- would be heard. This
made comparison easier and eliminated a physio-
logical effect which in some cases made the sec-
ond of two equally strong signals actually appear
weaker. The result was that differences in inten-
sity of 14 per cent could now be normally deter-
mined, which meant a reduction of the equisignal
zone to 4 degrees. As a further refinement, the
interlocking was made closer so that the spaces
became of equal length to the dots. The result
was that when equality had been obtained the sig-
nals merged into a new signal, namely, a dash or
T, which rapidly wavered and then dissolved into
a dash dash and then dot on one side and into a
dash dot dash and then dot dash on the other. The
final result was that an intensity change of 10 per
cent could be determined, which with the loops
in question means an angle of 3 degrees width."
The use of two Signal Corps beacons in San
Francisco and Hawaii was recently placed at the
disposal of the participants in the Dole flight to
Hawaii whose airplanes were provided with suit-
able receivers. In connection with the usefulness
of the Signal Corps beacon in this flight, the fol-
lowing extract from an interview with one of thc
successful aviators is quoted from the Washington
Herald of August 22, 1927:
"From the time we left Oakland we saw to one
thing ahead of everything else. That was to swing
directly into the radio beam that was sent out fror.i
San Francisco and the island of Maui to direct us.
"And this had value beyond estimate. We were
in the beam from about 25 miles out practically all
the way across the big gap. During the night we
flew between 6000 and 8000 feet up, and our prin-
cipal work was working out the air adjustment
and keeping the motor working.
"Above the clouds the weather was fine, with the
moon shining, and after we had eased into the cen-
ter of the radio beam all Davis had to worry about
was checking our heading by the sun.
"As we got farther out, however, the beacon be-
came faint, so we never shifted our wave length to
receive ships' messages, since we were afraid if
we lost the beacon we might not be able to pick it
up again."

THE UNIVERSITY GAS RESEARCH PROGRAM
By EDWARD R. NELL, '29E
IMPRESSED with the necessity of expanding
and accelerating the amount of research work
now being done in the gas industry, the Michi-
gan Gas Association has launched a program at
the University of Michigan that is the most ambi-
tious yet undertaken in the history of any simi-
lar group.
The gas companies of Michigan, through the
fellowship committee of its
state association, have just em-
ployed a director of research.
He will be located at Ann Ar-
bor. While the work will be
financed and managed by the
Michigan Gas Association, the
studies which are to be under-
taken will be typical of the en-
tire industry, and the results
will be made available to gas
men everywhere.
This will be the second im-
portant gas research program
to be inaugurated at the Uni-
versity of Michigan in one
year. Early in 1927, the Amer-
ican Gas Association appropri-
ated $10,000 a y ear for five
years toward a study of gas
for the heat treating of metals.
This work is now going forward under the direc-
tion of the Department of Engineering Research
of the University.
The Michigan Gas Association was probably the
first in the United States to undertake and en-
courage systematic research. Since 1900 it has
maintained a fellowship which called for expen-
ditures of approximately $1000 a year for making
studies in various processes used in gas plants. A
large number of important problems were inves-
tigated. The work has continued for more than
a quarter of a centurv, interrupted only by the late
war, and resumed immediately afterward.
Soon after the annual convention last July, it
was decided that the expansion of research was
one of the most important activities the associa-
tion could undertake. It was agreed that an ag-
gressive program headed by a competent engineer
who would give it all his time, would speed the so-
lution of many troublesome problems in gas mak-
ing. The estimated cost of launching the work
was underwritten by a number of member com-
panies, The Consumers Power Company, The De-
troit Edison Company, and The Semet-Solvay En-
DURING the past decade,
the gas industry in the
United States has increased in
importance to a point where it
is one of the largest in the en-
gineering field. This expan-
sion, both in volume and in
scope, has been brought about
largely through the solution of
important problems by means
of research programs conduct-
ed at the University of Michi-
gan. In this article the writer
has endeavored to give an idea
of the prpblems encountered in
gas engineering and the meth-
ods by which they are solved.

gineering Corporation. The work will be con-
ducted by Elmore S. Pettyjohn, who has just
moved to Ann Arbor to take up his duties. Mr.
Pettyjohn presents excellent qualifications for
serving the gas industry. He was graduated from
the University of Michigan in 1918, receiving his
A. B. Degree. He enlisted in the navy, in which
he served fourteen months. Following his dis-
charge, he worked for The
Semct-Solvay Company, a n d
The Ford Motor Company.
Later, he returned to the Uni-
versity and entered the Engi-
neering College, from which
he was graduated in February.
1922, and the following June
received his master's degree.
He was employed by the Illi-
nois Steel Company, and af-
terward by the Chicago By-
Product Coke Company. He
left the latter organization to
return once more to the Uni-
versity to accept his present
position.
Under the plan of procedure,
Mr. Pettyjohn will have avail-
able the laboratory and per-
sonnel resources of the De-
partment of Chemical Engineering at the Univer-
sity for his work. The assistance and counsel of
Professor Alfred H. White, head of the department,
will be at his disposal. Professor White has been
identified with the fellowship program since its in-
ception. In addition, Mr. Pettyjohn will be able to
follow up his laboratory work with actual operating
tests on any of the gas plants in Michigan. It is
the intention of the research committee to direct
its investigations into present-day problems, which
would make necessary the use of plant and serv-
ice equipment to test the volume of laboratory stu-
dies under the limitations of operating conditions.
The Michigan fellowship has attacked many dif-
ficult problems in the past. The first one dates
back to the days when gas was still the most impor-
tant lighting medium. Work was undertaken on
lighting with incandescent mantles. A three-year
study on the removal of napthalene followed, after
which the fellowship took up the subject of coal gas
manufacture. Case hardening, the weathering of
coal, gas in japanning and treatment of brass, com-
plete gasifacation, use of oxygen in gas producers,

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
UNIFYING ARCHITECTURE IN AMERICA
By R. W. SEXTON*
THE social, economic and industrial conditions,
in fact, the whole mode of living of the peo-
ple of a community, as well as the traits of
the individuals, are very markedly influenced by the
prevailing climate. In a country of such vast size-
as ours it is, therefore,
only natural, on ac-
count of the difference
in climate in the vari-
ous sections, that the
habits and customs
characteristic of the
people of one locality
are so much at vari-
ance with those of an-
other. To a certain
extent this is unfortu-
nate, for the peculiari-
ties and characteristics
of the people of the
country as a nation are
less easily distin-
guished, and our na-
tionalism is, to some
degree, thus lost sight
of. N e w Englanders
have, for example, al-
ways taken a certain
pride in the customs
which distinguish them
from New Yorkers.
Chicagoans claim that
they can recognize a
neighbor, no matter
how far from home; as for a New Yorker—well, he
is insulted if someone thinks he conies from Main
Street. So an American is first of all a Bostonian,
New Yorker or Chicagoan. And so it has always
been with our architecture.
There is not, and until recently it seemed as if
there never would be, a distinctly American style of
architecture. There are certain types of build-
ings that are especially characteristic of certain lo-
calities, but no one type can be said to typify the
American style of design. This state of affairs, too,
can be traced to climate and consequent social con-
ditions, for architectural design, based as it is on
structure, is itself very largely governed by climate.
Certain building materials are more popular in cer-
tain localities for thev withstand the climate of that

section they would soon perish. Then, too, old tra-
ditions have an influence on architecture, just as
they do on habits and customs, and another line is
drawn between buildings of different localities. In

the design of buildings
follows closely the tra-
dition of the old Span-
ish settlers and their
missions, which w ere
peculiar to the climate
and customs of the
people of that locality
in both design and
structure. In the Mid-
dle Atlantic section the
Grecian influence, typi-
cal of Colonial days, is
still discernible. In
New England the char-
acteristics of the early
American inhabitants
continue i n evidence,
while in Xew York the
skyscraper has become
the feature. All these
types can be indirectly
traced to climate which
dictates building mate-
rials and methods of
construction. The re-
sulting habits and cus-
toms of the people, and
even geographical status, especially in the case of
New York, has had some influence. And so we have
come through these one hundred and fifty years
minus a style of architectural design that we can
definitely point out as being distinctly American, in
a truly national sense.
Of these various types of buildings, typical of the
various localities of this country, the skyscraper
stands alone as being purely American. The origin
of some of the other types may be readily traced as
to early English, the Spanish, or to the Roman
classic, but the skyscraper is based on no precedent
written in the entire history of architecture through-
out the world. It represents actually a style of
architecture rather than a type of building. The
problem in design and construction, which it has
always offered, differs so from anything that has
ever been presented in architecture and building

before, that tradition, and precedent too, are of
no value whatever in its solution. Th skyscraper
differs from old time building principally in its
mass. Never in the history of architecture and
building have structures risen to such heights! Its
problem, as all problems in ar-
chitecture h a d always been,
was based on the relationship
of mass and voids, but while
the voids remained the same as
they had always been—for the
sizes of doors and windows are
practically fixed — the m a s s
was of proportions never be-
fore even considered. It is only
natural, then, that architects
centered their interest on the
designs of the mass, and gave
little thought, in comparison,
to ornamental details. And
such an unusual problem as
this one seemed to offer unlim-
ited opportunities and possi-
bilities to the architect.
In the history of architec-
ture, during the last four hun-
dred years especially, styles
and periods in architectural de-
sign were distinguished by
their ornament more than their
mass. The mass was practical-
ly unified after Gothic times,
and the style of a building was
characterized by its ornamen-
tal details. The difference in
building materials and conse-
quent methods of construction
characteristic of a building of
the Louis XVI period, as was
opposed to those characteristic
of a structure of the Georgian
style, was primarily in its or-
namental detail. Just so, the
early American house differs
from the Jacobean house in
England, if it differs at all, in
its details, not in its mass.
The American skyscraper,
however, reversed the old or-
der. It was not only a new style of architecture,
but in reality a new architecture. It is not strange,
therefore, that architects turned their attention en-
tirely to this phase of its design, and relegated the
design of ornamental details to second place. But
the skyscraper suffered by this condition. The
American skyscraper representative of a new Amer-
ican architecture, clothed in European ornament of
THE R1TZ TOWER, NEW YORK
four and five centuries before, lost its nationality
entirely. For fifty years, from its earliest concep-
tion to most recent times, one might well say that
the American skyscraper was not American at
all. For ornamental detail, architects and
designers of skyscrapers adapt
(as we say, to avoid plagiar-
ism, but we mean actually to
apply) forms and motifs of old
European styles and periods
without regard to materials or
structure, to say nothing of
habits and customs, climate or
tradition.
In spite, then of certain fea-
tures which would seem to
stamp it as purely American,
the skyscraper, adorned and
embellished with ornament of
European origin, lost whatever
individuality it possessed, and
in our large cities Classic, Re-
naissance, Gothic and even
Italian skyscrapers vied with
one another for prominence.
In attempting to adopt forms
and details peculiar to Euro-
pean conditions of the six-
teenth and seventeenth cen-
turies to a structural mass
characteristic of America of
the twentieth century, progress
in the new architecture was de-
layed.
In attempt to perfect mass
design, intensifying on that
problem to such an extent that
ornament was relegated to sec-
ond consideration, the architec-
ture in our cities became a con-
glomeration of elongated boxes
and ill - proportioned towers,
marvelous feats of engineering
skill, but lacking in their de-
sign, the very basic principles
on which architecture is found-
ed. With buildings striving to
outdo one another in height,
the streets became canyon-like
in appearance, the sun finding its way there only for
an hour or two during the middle of the day, play-
ing havoc with business, the very thing which the
tall buildings were intended to aid most. From the
land valuation point of view, conditions improved,
which can be very easily understood when it is real-
ized that three and four-story buildings were re-

ARCHITECTURAL MODELS AND THEIR VALUE
By ROY B. BLASS, '29A
MODEL making is fast becoming a necessary
part of Architectural design. Models have
always been used to some extent but only
within recent years have they been used to proper
advantage.
Most architects realize, now that competition is
brisk, that alterations and numerous drawings are
both difficult and costly. The use of models elimi-
nates much of this. Objectionable features which
show themselves on t h e
model can easily and
quickly be changed be-
fore full working draw-
ings are made. They are,
moreover, invaluable i n
enabling a client to appre-
ciate an architect's draw-
ings, and to discuss any
points which arise with a
full measure of compre-
hension.
No matter how experi-
enced the architect may
be i n "reading" a plan
and interpreting architec-
tural drawings, he must
take into consideration that the average client
cannot visualize the building clearly. It is in such
cases that the model is indispensable.
Even those architects who have little sympathy
with the use of models as aids in the preparation
of their designs and who consider themselves quite
competent to visualize the effect of their own geo-
metrical drawings, often find that the model-maker
has to be called for the purpose of explaining those
drawings to the untrained mind of the client.
The model is particularly serviceable when a
body of people, a committee, or a board of direc-
tors, have to be made to understand an architec-

SHOWING BUILDING ESSENTIALLY AS BUILT
tural scheme. When the exterior has been sub-
jected to criticism, the interior can be explained
by simply lifting off the upper part of the model
and revealing the miniature rooms within. On
the model having such subdivision, the meaning
of the technical expressions, "plan" and "section"'
becomes clear without verbal explanation.
In the processes of architectural design models
may afford innumerable advantages. Drawing-;
alone are insufficient to
express design in architec-
ture. Though models
alone may also fail to set
forth every aspect of the
design, they come nearer
to a true statement of im-
portant facts which ought
to be considered for every
building.
As a rule, the architect
builds up his ideas
through successive sketch
plans, knowing that his
early efforts are only step-
ping stones towards the
finished drawing. In ac-
cordance, one model may not show every detail
of the proposed building, but the architect may
proceed by way of many models towards the at-
tainment of the final result.
Co-ordination of the various elements is the life
of any art, and architecture is one of the most
fascinating of arts. Model-making has the faculty
of co-relating all the problems and permitting the
architect to group the relationship of part with
part, and of each part with the whole.
Xot only in elevation, but in perspective as well,
the bulk of the building has to be arranged to form

INDUSTRIES OF MICHIGAN—VI
CRANES AND PUMPING MACHINERY
By DOINAL HAMILTON HAINES
IT may seem to many readers of "The Technic"
that the grouping under one head of the t\v. &lt;
industries which are sketched in this article
is neither logical nor appropriate. It is true that
there is no connection or close relation between
the present-day industries in the state, and just
as t r u e as t h a t there
is neither scientific nor
historical likeness be-
tween them. But there
were two considera-
tions which seemed to
justify an otherwise
unwarranted method of
treatment.
In the first place, it
seemed to the untech-
nical mind of the writ-
er that, however far
apart today is the man-
u f a c t u r e of cranes
from the making of
pumps, the two indus-
tries have grown out of
a common human need
—the raising and han-
dling of huge masses of inert matter which could
be managed neither by man power nor horse

middle. To one end of it the object to be lifted
was fastened by ropes. At the other end was a
huge basket. Into this the laborers piled stones
until the basket outweighed the load and swung
it into the air. The process of lowering the raised
weight to its desired position was accomplished by
removing' stones from
the basket—which indi-
cates that the operation
of the "shadoof" must
have been about as dan-
gerous as it was crude.
With the invention
of the single pulley,
usually credited to Ar-
chytias, a disciple of
Pythagoras, hoisting
engines which were
great improvements
upon the shadoof as an
almost equally ancient
Hindu machine called
the "picotah" were pos-
sible, and the develop-
ment of the block-and-
tackle, having a num-
ber of pulleys and hoisting ropes (probably
due to Archimedes) was an even greater step
power; in this respect at least the pump and the forward. The early Romans were thoroughly fa-
crane are similar engines. And in the second place, miliar with the block-and-tackle, employing it ex-
there was the matter of limited space. In such
a series of brief sketches as that of which this is
one, it seemed unwise to devote an entire article
tensively in their engines of war as well as in build-
ing operations, and an illustration of a "polyspas-
ton" in "The Mechanical Triumphs of the Ancient
to cranes and another to pumping machinery, yet Egyptians," by Commander Barber, N. S. N., shows
neither could with fairness be considered more what may with reason be considered the earliest

joint treatment appeared the only solution.
It is almost inevitable that one should begin
any discussion of hoisting machinery by a refer-
ence to the building of the great pyramids in
Egypt, an engineering feat accomplished by sheer
man power--or at least without the aid of any
machinery more complex than the inclined plane.
But, whether or not it played any part in tin-
It is almost impossible to trace the development
of hoisting machinery from ancient through me-
dieval to modern times. It is not unlikely that as
far as the devices for the mere lifting of loads was
concerned, the engineers of the middle ages had
come fairly close to modern standards of efficiency;
what they lacked, of course, was motive power.
In the sketchbook of Leonardo da Vinci there are

tive steam crane into being four hundred years
before it was actually built.
The usefulness of the lever-hoist was long
known, but its full possibilities did not begin to
be seen until the substitution of the drum and
crank for the long end of the lever. The next
step forward was the increase in lifting power
through the use of gears, and then in the addi-

TAGE TO MORE ACCURATE CONTROL
tion of a boom, so that the load could be lifted at
some distance from the winch. The third great
improvement came with the placing of the winch
with its boom on a post so that it could be made
to rotate, thus bringing into being the first pillar
erane.
In 1811 there was built and operated in England
by Henry Maudsley a crane in which the rotat-
ing post was mounted on wheels—the direct an-
cestor of the modern machine, but of course a rela-
tively crude affair. It was hand-operated so that
its lifting power was small, while its "cruising ra-
dius" was also very limited. But, in its essentials,
it was the crane of today.
Modern cranes date from the invention of the
steam engine by Watt in the eighteenth century
and the application of the engine to hoisting ma-
chinery. The first steam locomotive cranes were
built in England. The first of a number of sta-
tionary steam derricks was built by James Taylor
of Birkenhead in 1839. These had single-cylinder
vertical engines with fly-wheels and were found t.,
be very dangerous. In 1853, Taylor took out a
patent for a steam winch with link reversing mo-
tion, double cylinders and no fly-wheel. Between
this date and 1858, a steam locomotive crane was
built by Taylor from designs made by \Y. W.
Hulse. Drawings are in existence of a crane built
by these two men in 1859 or 18o0, and show the
machine to be of wonderfully good design, full-
revolving with a variable radius boom, vertical
engines, a short boiler of locomotive type, the
whole mounted on a four-wheeled railway car.
At the time of the Philadelphia Centennial Ex-
position in 1876, no steam locomotive cranes had
been built in this country, and the only ones in use
in America had been imported from England, but
the first American-built crane of this type was in
existence four years later—1880—and from this
time English domination of the new industry
ceased. Today the United States leads the world
in crane building.
Modern industrial progress has brought into be-
ing an off-shoot of the power-driven crane, the trav-
eling crane, no less important than the locomotive
crane. When mechanical advance produced the
huge modern factory buildings, it was evident that
power-driven cranes which could be moved from
place to place were not sufficient to meet the re-
quirements of efficient production, so the traveling
crane, which is an integral part of the structure
in which it is installed, was born of the necessity.
Michigan not only stands at the top in the pro-
duction of cranes of both types, but has occupied
this position since the earliest days of the industry.
The Industrial Works at Bay City, manufacturers
of "rail traction and crawling tractor locomotive
cranes," was established in 1875, and the Shaw
Crane Works at Muskegon (now a part of the great
corporation of Manning. Maxwell &amp; Moore) manu-
facturers of electric traveling cranes was founded
in 1891.
The traveling crane has to work in three dimen-
tions: it must travel the length of the factory build-
ing in which it operates, it must also be able to
move from sidewall to sidewall, and it must raise
and lower weights. In the days before A. J. Shaw
—then of Milwaukee and later the founder of the
Shaw Crane Works at Muskegon—designed and
built the first three-motor electric cranes, the trav-
eling crane, while it had already gone far toward
speeding up and simplifying operations in machine
shops, foundries, etc., was still an uncertain and an
exceedingly dangerous piece of machinery. The
traveling cranes of the early days, mostly of the
"flying rope" type, were for the most part power
operated, but the power for all three of the opera-
tions came from the same source, from which re-
sulted most of the trouble.
In 1888 Mr. Shaw was master mechanic in the
A. E. Allis works at Milwaukee, and in this capac-
ity he had charge of several of the "flying rope"
cranes, so that he had a first-hand familiarity with
the troublesome delays due to their uncertainty and
the hazard to safety of the men operating them
which they constituted. The climax came when one
of these cranes collapsed and fell from the runways,
and Mr. Shaw was commissioned to construct a
better one. He conceived the idea of installing a


Page 15
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
separate motor to control each of the three move-
ments, and the crane which was built according to
these specifications was destined to be Shaw Crane
No. 1.
How far the inventor had gone in his first ma-
chine to saying the "last word" in the matter of
traveling cranes is pretty well established by the
fact that Shaw Crane No. 3, a 40-ton, double-trolley
crane, built in 1890 and installed in June of the
same year in the Union Pacific Railroad shops at
Cheyenne, Wyo., is still in operation after thirty-
seven years of use.
All traveling cranes—whether made at the Shaw
Works or elsewhere—are essentially alike and yet
no two of them exactly so. Each possesses the
same three main elements, the bridge, spanning the
width of the room in which it is to work, the two
ends earning wheels having flanges on both sides
and running on standard rails, the "trolley" which
runs back and forth across the bridge covering the
space between the walls, and the hoist proper, which
is located on the trolley. But here, as far as dimen-
sions and detail of construction go, the necessary
resemblance between any two cranes ends. As each
one is built into the structure in which it is to oper-
ate—sometimes when the building is erected—and
is designed to perform specific operations with
known materials, each one presents a different
problem in design and construction. It may, for
instance, be intended for use in a long, narrow build-
ing, so that the bridge will be relatively short, and
A DOUBLE ACTING STEAM DRIVEN PUMP
yet designed to lift very heavy objects, calling for
the heaviest possible construction and the instal-
lation of very powerful motors.
In the lifting apparatus itself there may be a de-
mand for nothing but the handling of small cast-
ings in a foundry, where the loads are comparatively
slight and the whole operation no more complicated
and exact than carrying them from one part of the
room to another. On the other hand, as in a loco-
motive works in which some of the Shaw cranes
have been installed, the load to be lifted may be the
whole body of a huge locomotive, and the opera-
tion the setting of this great mass of steel on the
running gear, where the crane itself must make
adjustments measured in fractions of an inch.
The manufacture of such products breeds in the
plants a spirit noticeably different from that which
prevails in a factory where quantity production is
the rule. Since its beginning in 1891, the Shaw
plant has designed, manufactured and installed
something over 4500 cranes. With the exception of
about twenty—of which a word more, presently—
il has kept track of all these cranes. In the offices
are the records of every crane, not only their di-
mensions and the technical details of their construc-
tion, but of the work they have done, the new parts
which have been supplied for them, and so on. Those
hundreds of cianes, scattered over the whole sur-
face of the earth, are still members of a family, and
every man in the plant, from the.engineers and de-
signers in the offices to the workmen in the great
shops setting up the templates from which the great
girders of the bridges will be copied, have an inti-
mate interest in every one. whether it is a 150-ton
monster with special bearings being made for a
shop in Springfield, 11l., or a little 10-ton product
of the late '90's which has been working for thirtv
odd years on the docks at Valparaiso or Port Said.
The twenty odd cranes of which there are no rec-
ords in the Shaw offices are those which, between
the years 1900 and 1916, were shipped into Rus-
sia. Whether they are still in operation (the life
of a traveling crane is almost indefinite, provided
there is a supply of parts) or have fallen a victim to
some Bolshevist outbreak is unknown. But aside
from these vanished few, the records of the huge
family are still complete.
Some notion of the scope of the company's busi-
ness is given by the following partial list of the

As has already been stated in the brief outline
of hoisting machinery history, American entry into
this field of manufacture, may be said roughly to
date from the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition
but the Industrial Works at Bay City antedated
this by three years, being founded in 1873 for the
purpose of producing special equipment for mill,
marine and railway use. This margin of three
years was of the utmost importance in the history
of the company, because they gave to the little-
plant in its two-story, early Victorian shop with the
cupola-stop just that much background of prac-
tical experience at the time American designers and
engineers were taking the first steps into the field
hitherto dominated by the English.
The early history of the works is a series of dates
on which these pioneers of the industry accom-
plished one small advance after another. At the
time, there were only a few steam shovls in use in
railroad construction throughout the United States,
and these machines were all wide gauge with very
little consequent mobility. In 1880, the first Amer-
ican-built steam shovel of standard gauge was built
at the Industrial Works, this date really marking
the formal entry of the company into the field of
heavy equipment for railroads.
The next significant date is 1883. At that time
the only railroad wrecking crane in the whole coun-
try was owned and operated by a Michigan rail-
road and had been built in the railroad shops. Their
second crane was built by the Industrial Works.
It was of 20-ton capacity, a feeble and crude piece
of machinery compared to its monster descendants.
The boom was mounted at one end of a wooden
flat car over double four-wheel trucks, while the
boiler and machinery were on a stationary mount
at the other end of the car. Manilla ropes were used
instead of the wire cables of today, while the work-
ing radius of the crane was very limited; the load
could be slewed through a small arc by means of a
rack device on the boom.
Three four-ton wharf cranes had been built in
1883. the cranes being mounted on fixed bases and
steam supplied to them from independent boilers.
Three years later, steam wharf cranes were mounted
on four-wheel railroad cars at the Industrial Works.
These were the direct forerunners of the modern
locomotive cranes. In the same year another im-
portant advance was made through the adaptation
of the revolving crane. Several fifteen-ton railroad
cranes were built in which the crane proper—in-
stead of merely the boom—was mounted at one
end of the car and the boiler at the other. Some of
these cranes built in the '80's are still in use and
giving excellent service.
Seven cranes from the Industrial Works were ex-
hibited at the World's Fair in Chicago in 1893, and
were awarded first prize and a gold medal. Thi;
conspicuous success and the world-wide attention
attracted by the cranes gave a great impetus to
construction and successive improvements at the
Industrial Works. This advance is perhaps best
shown by the steady increase in the maximum lift-
ing capacity of the cranes manufactured. The fol-
lowing table shows this progress with the years
in which each increase was made:
1893 12-ton
1894 20-ton
18% 30-ton
1897 40-ton
1899 50-ton
1902 60-ton
1903 70-ton
1904 100-ton
1909 120-ton
1911 150-ton
1915 160-ton
1922 200-ton
This table requires a little explanation. At a
glance it is hard to reconcile the fact that nineteen
years passed between the 12-ton crane of the early
'90's and its 200-ton descendant of 1922, although
increases which almost doubled lifting capacity
stand only a year or two apart in the table. This
seeming inconsistency is due to the fact that the
table is really the record of successive experiments
in sheer engineering daring. The designers at the
Industrial Works kept pitting their wits against
the seemingly impossible. Each time they achieved
a considerable advance, they were ready to agree
with the opinion of the outside world which said.
"This is certainly the largest crane which can be
built and successfully transported over a railroad."
But now that they have demonstrated the complete
practicability of the 200-ton crane—at the moment
the largest in the world—they are not prepared to
say what the ultimate limit may be.
It may surprise the outsider to learn that there
is a "used crane business" just as there is a "used
car business." This is naturally far more true of
the locomotive than of the traveling crane business,
although not entirely unknown in the latter by any
means. Many locomotive cranes are purchased by
contractors for one piece of work. Their next job
may be in a distant corner of the world, and of a
nature calling for equipment of another sort. It is
more economical to sell the perfectly sound but
temporarily useless crane at a loss than to let it
stand idle and depreciate—hence the second-hand
business. The manufacturer doesn't particularly
like it, but recognizes that—in view of the long-
wearing and expensive nature of the machines he
makes—it is inevitable.

It is impossible here to go into details regarding
the various types of cranes and similar machines
now manufactured at the Industrial Works. They
include rail, traction and crawling tractor cranes,
barge, wharf and gantry (portable pier) cranes,
steam shovels, pile drivers, portable railcutters,
operated by steam, gasoline and electricity.
The plant at which these monsters of modern
industry arc created is naturally a good deal like
a small city. That it is complete, from the nerve
center office to the most remote stockyard goes
without saying. Growth has brought a great deal
beside mere size and a gratifying increase in out-
put.
As an interesting detail in support of this state-
ment, the plant safety department and hospital fur-
nishes perhaps the best instance. In any factory
of such size, employing hundreds of men, dealing
with molten metal, the handling of huge castings.
the setting up of gigantic machines and the inces-
sant running of exhaustive tests of all sorts it might
naturally be expected that the human casualty list
would be heavy. A few years ago this was deplor-
ably true. The company expected an annual ex-
penditure running well up into the thousands to
compensate employees for injuries then regarded
as inevitable. Now all this has changed. Modern
mechanical progress has been accompanied at even
pace by the "safety first" campaign. The workman
has been safeguarded in two ways: every device
which will stand between him and possible injury
has been installed, and, perhaps even more impor-
A LOW PRESSURE CENTRIFUGAL PUMP ELECTRICALLY
DRIVEN
tant, he has been educated ceaselessly to take care
of himself. The results are nothing short of amaz-
ing. The writer was shown the hospital records. A
few years ago, injuries were frequent, all too fre-
quent, and very often serious. Now, the head of
the Industrial Works hospital displayed a record
sheet showing an incredibly small number of slight
mishaps covering a period of several months. Only
three or four men had been so badly hurt that they
lost time from their work, and the only really seri-
ous case—that of an amputated finger—had been
due to infection caused by negligence on the part of
the injured man. If looked at only from the stand-
point of economy, the hospital and safety depart-
ment would be of the utmost value to the company.
Within the very near future there will be carried
into effect a consolidation between the Industrial
Works and the Brown Hoisting Machinery Co. of
Cleveland, O., the new corporation to be known as
the Industrial Brownhoist Corporation, whose gen-
eral offices will be located in Cleveland. The mer-
ger is one certain to be of the utmost importance to
the industries to be served by the new corporation,
as it is designed primarily to give better service
to users of material-handling equipment through the
elimination of overlapping and duplicating equip-
ment where it exists. Both the merging concerns
are outstanding in the field, the Brown company
having been founded in 1880. The merger will
bring under one management some 2100 people and
assets of approximately $13,000,000. The present
plants of the two companies, at Bay City, Mich.,
Cleveland and Elyria, O., will continue to operate
under the single administration.
One must probe even farther back into the shad-
owy, uncertain years of history for the first traces
of man's experiments in the labor of lifting water
from its natural level to heights at which he could
turn it to use. There are evidences of crude water
lifts—most of them of the bucket-lift sort—in very
ancient times, and hand pumps of various kinds
were comparatively common in the 15th century.
The first authentic evidence of distinct progress
toward perfection in water-lifting devices is re-
corded in 1675, when Sir Samuel Moreland took out
a patent in England on a pump in which a plunger
was substituted for the piston. A double-acting
force pump was made by La Hire, a member of the
French Academy in 1716, and what was probably
the first pump of the centrifugal type by Lemour
in 1732. The first recorded compressed air pump is
credited to Schemnitz of Hungary in 1755.
American connection with the pump-making in-
dustry came at a relatively late date, several pat-
ents on pumps of the ejector type being taken out
in this country between the years 1860 and 1870.
One of the first manufacturing concerns in this
field was the American Steam Pump Co. (also one
of the pioneer industries of Battle Creek) which
was incorporated under the laws of Michigan on
July 3. 1873—the same year which saw the founding
of the Industrial Works at Bay City, and which
lies in the center of that period which witnessed
the beginnings of so many of the state's present-
day manufacturing enterprises.
Like many another venture which has finallv
achieved lasting success in a highly specialized field
of manufacture, the American Steam Pump Com-
pany began its work along lines of seemingly slight

THE WHY OF THE TELEVOX
By \\. J. WENSLEY
Switchboard Engineer, Wesiinghaute Electric and Manufacturing Co.
UNLEASHED by the sight of two mechan-
isms carrying on an animated telephonic
conversation with one another and execut-
ing orders delivered over the phone, the vivid imag-
ination of the newspaper reporters and special writ-
ers have run riot and
many remarkable and un-
expected attributes have
been thrust on the Tele-
vox. It is the purpose ol
this article to give the
real and serious purpose
back of this development.
Even granting the the-
oretical possibility of such
a device, it is not intend-
ed that a home model be
put on the market with
the ability to prepare
soup w hen given the
proper code of whistles
over the phone from the
afternoon bridge club.
But in all seriousness the
device may make the
preparation of the soup
possible by enabling the
power system dispatcher
to reroute the supply of
electricity so that service
may be quickly restored
to the electric range after
a storm, fire or other disaster. The Telex ox was de-
veloped to supplement but not supplant supervisory
control systems which have come into such gen-
eral use in the last few years. The use of small
distributing substations is becoming more and
more the accepted method of supplying the elec-
trical needs of large cities. To carry this plan to
its logical conclusion these stations must be unat-
tended. Wholly reliable means are available for
the periodic reclosing of the local distribution feed-
ers. It is not so simple to control the incoming high
tension feeders which may form part of a ring or
other complicated network. It is most desirable
that the system operator be given some means by
which he can issue instructions to the apparatus
in the unattended stations and receive replies that
his instructions have been obeyed. For impor-

tant or large substations where the expense is war-
ranted, there is no better method than by the use
of one of the available types of supervisory con-
trol. These systems require individual control cir-
cuits of from two to four wires. These wires may
be specially installed for
the purpose or m a y b e
leased from the telephone
company. In either case
there is considerable ex-
pense involved. For the
more important stations
this expense is fully war-
ranted, but for the lesser
stations the tendency
among many power com-
panies is to take a chance
and depend on quick
transportation to get a
man to the station after
an outrage. If a man
were actually in the sta-
tion, the solution would
be quite simple. The dis-
patcher would pick up his
telephone, call the substa-
tion and order certain
breaker movements. But,
as we have have already
stated these stations are
too small to justify hu-
man attendance, hence, the telephone is useless.
The public telephone systems have been brought
to a high state of perfection. Recent improvements
in operating technique have greatly speeded the
connection time of the Bell system. In spite of the
time worn jokes regarding the slowness of the ex-
change operators it is now a matter of common
comment that connections are secured with an ac-
curacy and speed that leave but little to be desired.
With this great and reliable means of public com-
munication available in every corner of our cities
and towns it seemed a pity that it could not be used
for the purpose of controlling these small, unat-
tended stations. If there were only a machine with
sufficient intelligence to answer the telephone and
carry out a few simple instructions and give some
replies, the problem would be solved.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
In response to this need came the Televox. This
is literally a machine endowed with enough appar-
ent intelligence to carry on a conversation over a
standard telephone through exchanges and their
connecting cables in exactly the same manner as
would a human operator, were such available. This
device must not transgress the rules laid down by
the telephone companies regarding attachments to
their lines or instruments. Every effort is put forth
by these companies to maintain their service at a
high degree of efficiency. This could not be done
were unauthorized persons permitted to make
changes in the electrical circuits or the telephone
instruments themselves. The telephone companies'
very rigid but justifiable restrictions, therefore,
made it necessary that the Televox actually "listen"
to the receiver and "speak" into the transmitter.
The standard telephone systems provide channels
which will carry all frequencies between 300 and
2&lt;S(X) cycles with a reasonably small attenuation.
The operating tones or "voice" of the Televox must
stay within these limits. For the first sample,
which is the one that has received such wide pub-
licity, tones corresponding to 600. 900 and 1400 cy-
cles were chosen. It will be noted that the upper
frequency falls between the second harmonics of
the two lower frequencies. This is necessary to
prevent possible false operation due to the har-
monic operation of the amplifier for the higher fre-
quency, should this be a multiple of one of the
lower frequencies.
The first model, described in this article, is an ex-
perimental device and is necessarily crude. It in
no way exhausts the possibilities in this new form
»
of control.
The dispatcher's equipment consists of three tun-
ing fork oscillators, a two-stage audio amplifier, a
loud speaker unit and three push puttons. The
standard desk telephone is placed on the desk in
front of the loud speaker unit.
At the substation there is a larger cabinet which
contains a two-stage amplifier, three ladder type
filters and three individual frequency amplifiers.
Relays in the plate circuits of the output tubes in
these final amplifiers operate the selective portion
of the equipment. A set of telephone relays and
selector switches comprise the selective equipment.
On the side of the box is a shelf on which the stand-
ard desk telephone is placed. The receiver is left
oft" the hook and is placed on a microphone which
forms the electrical "ear" of the unit. A weighted
arm projects from the side of the box to depress
the hook switch on the phone. This is arranged to
be lifted by a magnet inside the cabinet. The tele-
phone may be lifted from the shelf and used in the
ordinary manner without the necessity for detach-
ing or disconnecting any device. When finished
with its use as an ordinary telephone, the instru-
ment is replaced on the shelf and is immediately in
readiness for automatic operation.
All language is but a succession of sound strung
together in various combinations. As there are but
few operations to perform, the language need not
be complicated. The three frequencies before men-
tioned are used as three monotone syllables and all
the various commands are translated into a lan-
guage composed of these. This might be called
"Televoxanto" with apologies to Esperanto.
Let us vision a scene in the dispatcher's office of
a central station equipped with the Televox.
The telephone rings. "Dispatcher speaking."
"This is the service department. We have three
calls from 26th and Y Sts."
"All right. We'll investigate and call you back."
The dispatcher hangs up and turns to his sys-
tem map. "Let's see. That will be feeder 16-S-5
out of sub. 16."
The dispatcher consults his telephone index and
picks up his telephone receiver. "A line please,"
this to the private branch operator.
"Number please."
"Valley 6000."
"Thank you 6000."
And then the dispatcher hears in the telephone
receiver, "Buzz .. . buzz ... buzz ... buzz ...
buzz ... buzz .. . buzz," which translated from
Televoxanto into English says, "This is the Tele-
vox at Substation 16 speaking. What can we do
for you?"
The dispatcher places his phone in front of the
speaker unit on the front of his Televox cabinet and
pushes the button marked 1400 five times. The
loud speaker says, "Tweet tweet .... tweet ....
tweet .... tweet," which says to the substation,
"Connect me with breaker number five and tell me
if it is open or closed."
And then the buzzer at the substation buzzes out
the information that breaker number five is open.
The dispatcher pushes the button marked 900 and
the loudspeaker says "Toot," which is short for
"Close it." The buzzer then says that the breaker
closed but opened again almost immediately. "Close
it again." This time the buzzer says that the
breaker stays in.
The 600 cycle button causes the speaker to say
"Whoop." which is the way the Televox has of
saying, "That is all. Goodbye." The substation
hangs up; the dispatcher hangs up but immediately
calls the service department and asks them to call
the persons making the complaint to see if service
has been satisfactorily restored, also to send out a
man to patrol the line and locate the trouble if
possible.

ARCH DAMS
By PROF. CHARLES D. MARX
Chairman, Committee on Arch Dam Investigation, Stanford University, California
WATER serves humanity in many ways, yet
few persons know how engineers control
it. Rain falls and snow melts irregu-
larly; there are floods and droughts. In many
places water must be stored, or its level raised, or
its course changed, for development of hydro-elec-
tric power, for water supply of communities, for
irrigation, for flood control, for navigation in rivers
and canals. Dams are means to these ends. Some
dams are walls of concrete or other masonry, of a
variety of shapes. As engineers have been embol-
dened by experience, dams have been built higher.
Many now exceed 200 feet and a height of even
700 feet has been considered. Because stored water
becomes vitally necessary to those dependent upon
it and because the breaking of a dam would in
many places destroy life and property, dams must
be unquestionably safe. Yet they may not be too
costly.
A few centuries ago an engineer conceived that
curving a dam upstream would make it stronger.
A curved dam would in some situations act as an
arch stood on its edge; hence engineers took ad-
vantage of the arch strength as revealed in bridges
and buildings. A single curved wall will act as an
arch only in a narrow canyon, or gorge, with steep
rock sides. Also engineers used for dams across
wider valleys series of arches, between buttresses.
Arch dams were developed on assumption and
theory. With safety in mind many curved dams
were made so thick they could have but little arch
action. About thirty-five years ago, an engineer
built a dam in Bear Valley, near Redlands, Califor-
nia, so thin that conservative dam builders gasped.
It still stands. Other thin arch dams were built in
several countries. None built by an engineer has
failed.
There was divergence of engineering opinion.
Experimental knowledge was much desired, but
obstacles were forbidding. In 1922, Engineering
Foundation undertook an investigation. A com-
mittee of engineers was organized. Observations
on existing dams were undertaken, but this method
was difficult and slow. Available instruments were
not satisfactory. Consideration was given to mod-
els and to methods and instruments. A meeting
of the committee was enthused by a proposal from
a large power company to build an experimental
dam fifty to a hundred feet high, and the offer of
a substantial contribution.
Financing and planning went along together.
Power companies, industries, bankers, government-
al bureaus, universities, American and foreign engi-
neers joined Engineering Foundation in carrying
on the investigation. Better instruments became
available, some being devised especially by sub-
committees and collaborators. For this full-size ex-
periment favorable conditions existed not likely to
be duplicated in many years. In the Sierras, 60
miles east of Fresno, California, Stevenson Creek,
tumbles down the mountain through a granite
gorge into the canyon of San Joaquin River. On
this creek was an ideal spot. It was near a tunnel
through the mountain conveying a great volume of
water to a power plant. A small pipe, controlled
by valves, led from the tunnel to the creek, above
the dam site, so that the reservoir could be filled as
desired, like a tank in a laboratory. The reservoir
was so small that the quantity of water needed was
unimportant. Even if the dam should break while
the reservoir was full, no damage would result. The
power company was constructing extensive works
in the region. Hence a works railroad, a highway,
electric light and power, equipment, supplies, and
skilled men were at hand.
When the excavation in the rock was almost
ready for the dam, an untimely flood washed rocks
and sand into the trench, causing delay and ex-
pense. June 4, 1926, the dam was completed to .i
height of 60 feet. It was shaped like a symmetrical,
triangular piece of the side of a round can, stood
on its point, curved upstream. It was built of port-
land cement concrete without steel reinforcement.
Thousands of parts of instruments were embedded
for making tests. Its thickness was reduced from
7l/2 feet at the bottom to only 2 feet 30 feet above
and is 2 feet for the upper 30 feet. It is 140 feet
long on top. Thousands of measurements of strain,
deflection and temperature were made with the
water at various depths up to 60 feet, and with no
water in the reservoir, according to a program,
from June to October. To have practically no
change of temperature and moisture during a test,
measurements were made at night. Late in No-
vember a flood overtopped the dam at least three
feet, destroying the observation platforms and many
instrument connections and partially filling the
reservoir with sand and rock. This prevented cold
weather tests planned for January. There was an-
other flood in February. The dam still stands.

Stevenson Creek dam was tested with mercury in-
stead of water. The results agreed remarkably.
Models of larger sizes, of mortar and other sub-
stances, are being planned of dams of the same
*hape as the Stevenson Creek dam and several oth-
er shapes. Stevenson Creek dam should be built
higher and tested until it breaks. Useful informa-
tion has been gotten and is being made into a book.

connection with those which it was ultimately to
follow. At the outset, the small plant in which the
business was carried on was engaged in the manu-
facture of sawmill and woodworking machinery.
After some years, a side line of pumps for boiler
feed service on traction engines was developed, and.
with the passage of time and the gradual decline of
the lumber and allied industries in Michigan, the
side line became more important than the main line,
and the whole direction of the company's future
was changed.
To follow the history of the company with the
detail which just treatment of so important an in-
dustry demands would require nothing less than a
survey of every industry engaged in the manufac-
ture of machines into which pumps of one sort or
another are built as integral parts, with references
to all those changes in the material structure of
society which have required adaptations of pump-
ing machinery for purposes undreamed of in the
early days, and for the handling of materials which
the pump makers of the '80's and '90's never
guessed would ever require their attention.
The history of this company, like those of the
two crane manufacturing plants already briefly
sketched, has been one of typically American ex-
pansion and rapid growth in keeping pace with the
demands made upon it by new industries in hither-
to undeveloped fields and old ones whose progress
had given birth to unexpected needs. The only
difference is one inherent in the industries them-
selves: the pump manufacturer was less absorbed
in the perfection of more powerful devices than in
altering the specifications and designs of proved
and tested pumps so that they might handle other
materials than water and function successfully un-
der new conditions.
Centrifugal pumps—single suction, double suc-
tion, solid case, split case—creamery pumps, oil
pumps, sand and gravel pumps, pumping machinery
for the equipment of factories in the ever-growing
sugar, salt and paper industries, for handling the
water and heating systems of hotels and other huge
modern buildings: all these demands, plus innu-
merable others, required the development of a line
so large and varied that the index of the company's
catalogue now covers several pages of closely
printed type, and any day may witness a fresh de-
mand from some quarter which will set the de-
signers to work afresh.
The increase in the physical dimensions of the
plant has been far greater than might be guessed
by anyone glancing at the buildings from the car
windows of a train passing through Battle Creek.
The business has grown in a fashion which has left
neither time nor opportunity for a complete reor-
ganization and rehousing of equipment. As a fresh
need developed, a building was added to meet it.
The greatest single accession occurred in 1923
when the entire plant of the Advance Pump and
Compressor Co., adjoining the American Pump Co.
on the east, was taken over. Thus, while a casual
glance gives little notion of size, the present plant
covers a floor space of over 160,000 square feet.
The "line" manufactured by the company—
known as the American-Marsh pumps—includes
simplex, duplex, centrifugal and power types, with
capacities ranging from five gallons to eight thou-
sand gallons per minute, as well as air compres-
sors. The original lines of sawmill and woodwork-
ing machinery have long since been discontinued.
One of the most interesting pumps manufactured
by the American company is the latest addition to
its products, the Barton Portable Pump. This
relatively tiny unit is direct connected to the en-
gine on the front of a motor car, truck or tractor, of
practically any standard make. They are largely
employed by contractors and by telephone com-
panies for their underground work, but perhaps
their most important field on usefulness is on the
fire trucks of small town and rural fire departments.
One of these pumps will "boost" the efficiency of
a twenty-five to fifty-pound per square inch water
pressure (a common figure for small towns and vil-
lages) one hundred per cent, or will throw two
streams supplying 270 gallons a minute over a four-
story factory building, the water being pumped
from a stream through a ten-foot suction lift.
Among the complete installations made by the
American Steam Pump Co. are the following:
The Blackstone Hotel, Chicago.
The Union League Club, Chicago.
Drake Hotel, Chicago.
C. B. &amp; Q. Building, Chicago.
Bell Telephone Bldg., Chicago.
Michigan Central Terminal, Detroit.
Miami Biltmore Hotel, Miami Beach, Fla.
Great Western Sugar Co., Johnstown, Colo.
In all, the company has now over 200,000 pumps
in actual operation.

nal communication with moving elements, and sec-
ondarily is to furnish an alternative means of com-
munication between land units. This necessitates
a dual development of signal corps equipment.
Field or readily portable equipment must be light,
compact, simple, quick of installation, and rugged.
It must be waterproof and not affected by climatic
conditions because its usefulness extends from the
arctic to tropical climates.
The requirements for fixed stations are not as
difficult of accomplishment and the development
of this type of equipment is parallel to that of
commercial developments. Recently considerable
work has been undertaken to determine the use-
fulness of high frequencies, that is, about 1500 kilo-
cycles, especially with reference to airplane and
ground use. This type of equipment is light in
wreight and is capable of more compactness for the
same distance ranges. These factors being of para-
mount importance in the case of aircraft radio, it
is expected to eventually replace all airplane radio
sets with short wave equivalents.
Several 250 watt short wave experimental sta-
tions have been distributed from the Signal Corps
laboratories and are at the present in operation.
Other branches of the Signal Corps including R.
O. T. C. and National Guard Signal Corps Units
have installed short wave equipment.
A particularly favorable opportunity to carry
out some work on this line presented itself here at
the University of Michigan last spring. Professor
\Y. H. Hobbs, of the Geology Department, was
taking an expedition to Mount Evans, Greenland,
to gather meteorological data. It was his inten-
tion to leave part of the expedition on Mount
Evans during the winter of 1927-1928. He asked
the Signal Corps R. O. T. C. unit at the Univer-
sity if they would be able to keep communication
with this party on Mount Evans during the win-
ter, stating that a qualified radio operator with
equipment for a 250 watt station would be left at
Mount Evans with the meteorological observers.
This was essentially a short wave project. It did
not appear to present any particular difficulties but
it was unique insofar as it presented an oppor-
tunity to carry out certain development work over
a considerable period of time on a definite sched-
ule with a station at some distance. It was deter-
mined to build a 250 watt transmitting station with
crystal control, using a Hertz antenna. Equip-
ment was obtained from that on hand at the Uni-
versity in the Department of Electrical Engineer-
ing, from the equipment in the possession of the
Signal Corps Unit and by purchases from outside
sources by governmental funds. The station was
built and put into operation on November 2nd, and
excellent reports were immediately received when
tests were made. One obstacle developed almost
at once. It was found that after the crystal heated
up the frequency varied an appreciable amount and
stability was not therefore satisfactory. After
further investigation it was decided to rebuild the
set using a master oscillator before further work
was done with the crystal. This stabilized the set
and a crystal tone was reported by stations with
whom tests were made. Communication was first
established with the expedition at Mount Evans on
December 2nd, and since that time daily communi-
cation between the personnel there and Professor
Hobbs has been possible.
UNIFYING ARCHITECTURE
(Continued from page 11)
placed by others twenty-three and twenty-four stor-
ies high. But from an artistic point of view, an ar-
chitectural viewpoint, they deserve little praise. The
remedy seemed to be in stabilizing in some way
these roaring masses of various shapes and sizes.
Such stabilizing could only come by law. No law
could fix the shape or design of a building, but a
law can fix its height.
A zoning law for New York City, where the sky-
scrapers had originated and developed, was sug-
gested and promptly enacted, by which a structure
is allowed to rise straight up from the street line
only to a height determined by the width of the
street upon which it faced. If the building is car-
ried beyond that height, it must, from that point up-
ward, slant backward, and must be kept within a
line drawn from the center of the street through the
top of the wall on the street or building line. Dif-
ferent height allowances determined various zones.
The law of zoning means that a pyramid be super-
imposed on a cube. A pyramid is especially unsuited
for windows, for example, unless they be dormers,
so architects developed a series of set-backs or ter-
races that, as they stepped backwards and upward,
kept within the pyramidal line.
In certain other cities where a zoning law is en-
forced, as in Chicago, for example, the height
straight up from the building line is fixed at so
many feet and set-backs, also definitely established.
There is a provision in the New York zoning law
that upon twenty-five per cent of the area of the
plot the building may be carried to an unlimited
height. This clause is responsible for the towers
which frequently surmount these structures.
It has taken us some years to learn that a style,
worthy to be so called, must come from the peo-
ple. An American style of architecture must bear
the marks of American nationalism, and not repre-
sent only the ideas of a select few. Furthermore,
a style of architecture must be based on building


Page 23

materials and methods in vogue in the country
where the style originates. To overcome, then, the
variation in climate, prevalent in the different lo-
calities of this vast country, building materials and
methods of construction must be developed that
will withstand the various climates, and at the same
time be as appropriate in our temperature as in
another. Or, designs must be originated that will
adapt themselves to the various materials and meth-
ods of building in use in the various localities.
The modern skyscraper seems to have solved these
problems so far as the tall building is concerned.
Its mass, at least, is just as appropriate to the struc-
tural qualifications of San Francisco, St. Louis,
Cleveland or New York. Its success is due prima-
rily to its natural development wherever it is erected.
Its mass and its ornamental details arise naturally
from its structural plan. In a building designed in
a pure style, materials and methods of construction
are never challenged. That is one of the first prin-
ciples on which architecture is founded, and it is
the principle on which the modern American sky-
scraper is being developed.

instantaneous carbonization, and ammonium sul-
phate production and disposal followed.
It is interesting to note that a number of men who
held the fellowships have become prominent in the
gas industry. The first man to work under the
Michigan Association's auspices was Herman Rus-
sell, now vice-president of The Rochester Gas and
Electric Corporation. Some of the others are: Alva
F. Traver, now vice-president of the Columbus, Ohio
Gas Utilities Company; Samuel Ball, now district
manager of The Consumers Power Company, Bay
City, Michigan; William A. Dunkley, now superin-
tendent of the gas department, Memphis (Tennes-
see) Power and Light Company; R. S. Tour, now
Professor of Chemical Engineering, University of
Cincinnati; J. W. Hacker, superntendent, Central
Alloy Steel Corporation, Massillon, Ohio; C. K.
Wirth, Semet-Solvay Engineering Corporation, New
York.
The matter of the research fund and the appoint-
ment of Mr. Pettyjohn as an investigator will come
formally before the Regents for acceptance and ap-
proval at their December meeting.
Several months ago The American Gas Associa-
tion brought the University an annual appropria-
tion of $10,000 on a five-year plan for the conduct-
ing of research on the utilization of gas. This is
being conducted by Walter E. Jominy, a graduate
of the University in 1915, who was later employed by
The Studebaker Corporation, Liberty Motors, and
The Packard Motor Company. For the past two
years Mr. Jominy has been an investigator in the
University Department of Engineering Research.
He is now making a study of the utilization of gas
in steel forging, which is of particular interest to
the automobile industry.
The first of Mr. Pettyjohn's investigations will be
in the field of water-gas manufacture from coal. At
the present time water-gas is being manufactured
almost exclusively from coke, a process which has
been perfected in years gone by and which gives
good results. The only water-gas plant which uses
coal for its basic raw material is the one at Port
Huron, Michigan. Although water-gas which is
made from coal is much better from the consumer's
standpoint, than that made from coke, the difficul-
ties encountered in its manufacture make steady
production hard to maintain. If the method of manu-
facture could be improved it would be more eco-
nomical from the producer's standpoint also, since
coke costs much more than coal. It is the purpose
of Mr. Pettyjohn to go to this plant in Port Huron
and make an intensive study of its difficulties, an.l
run elaborate tests, in order to obtain conclusive
data upon the major difficulties which are now be-
ing encountered. After he has completed this pre-
liminary adjunct to his work, he will return to the
University to begin actual research upon the prob-
lems which he finds most pressing. At the pres-
ent time Mr. Pettyjohn is occupied in the Univer-
sity laboratories in the construction of testing ap-
paratus and in obtaining materials which he will
use during his work at the Port Huron water-gas
plant. After this matter of important research has
been successfully completed he will turn to other
important problems of the gas industry.
The fellowship committee of The Michigan Gas
Association is as follows: Chairman, James A.
Brown, Jackson; John W. Batten, Detroit; Dan W.
Hayes, Port Huron; Charles R. Henderson, Ann Ar-
bor; Fred W. Seymour, Battle Creek; and Frank
W. Steere, of New York.
Gas is fast becoming one of the most important
exponents of heat in large manufacturing plants.
The recent large increase in gas consumption at the
Ford plants is but one of many. Gas is playing a
major role in the manufacture of the new Ford
automobile. More than twice as much gas is being
used in heating processes in turning out the new
car than was used to make the old model. The vast
majority of the heating operations in the Fordson
plant at Detroit are done by means of gas. Fifty
million cubic feet of this fuel are being used daily,
whereas only twenty-three million were used pre-
viously. The Ford Motor Company has apparently
determined that gas as a fuel has definite advan-
tages over all others. The use of gas in heating op-
erations was largely developed through intensive
research conducted at the University several years
ago.

THE NEW YEAR
To most of us the New Year means New Year's
resolutions and New Year's greetings. It is the end
of the old and the beginning of the new. It is the
much needed change which long continued industry
requires in order to break up the monotony and
routine and start over again. But to some, a select
few, to most of us no different than the rest, the
new year has greater meaning. It is not only a new
start, it is opportunity, opportunity to bring out
what the past has failed to reveal.
Looking back over the past year at the enormous
changes which have taken place in industry, at the
remarkable feats accomplished in almost every line
of endeavor it is fair to say that 1927 has made its
full contribution; that the world has not been
asleep. Yet that select few who have already given
their part toward 1927 see in 1928 new possibilities.
Never satisfied, they grasp at the future far ahead
and would make it yield to them the secrets to come
that humanity may benefit. The mistakes of the
past are forgotten, ponderous as they may have
seemed at their hour, for in truth they have served
only to guide us in the correct path more than to
hold us back. North, South, East, and West lies the
vast unknown. Opportunity opens before us in
countless directions. It is the foundation of our
hopes. This is the New Year.
portation in air, on land, and in water must be im-
proved. Too many lives that are valuable are lost
through accidents and carelessness. The public
can safely place its confidence in the engineer. He
can and will show himself equal to any problem
that mav come before him.
ENGINEERING RESPONSIBILITY
As an engineer looks back upon the past year
he rejoices at the achievements of the many in his
profession. He sees the completion of several im-
portant tunnels and bridges. The advancement in
aviation induced by distance flights absorbs his at-
tention. He marvels at the progress in the build-
ing of skyscrapers; at the ingenuity of the archi-
tects. He praises the work of those in charge of
communication engineering. B u t—the engineer
cannot and does not dwell on the past.
It is the engineer who has helped make living as
complex as it is. It is the engineer who has made
himself responsible for human life. Therefore it is
his chief duty to prepare for the future welfare of
the human race. In the past year great floods have
devastated large areas. Many lives were taken and
millions of dollars' worth of property was destroyed.
The mighty task of preventing future floods rests
on the shoulders of the engineer. Means of trans-
CURIOSITY
One usually thinks of curiosity as a human proc-
ess that makes us want to pry into the affairs of
others which should not concern us. One thinks of
it as that something that makes us listen to re-
marks that are not intended for our ears. Yet isn't
there something more to curiosity than this? I
think there is. What about the curiosity that gives
some men such pleasure in investigating the phe-
nomena of nature. Isn't this a kind of curiosity
which we can all cultivate to advantage? This type
of "idle curiosity" as Veblen has called it is a
unique human process and has led to many inter-
esting and useful discoveries.
Galileo was a thoughtful youth and always curi-
ously interested in the things about him. He doubt-
lessly turned over a rich and varied trend of
thought in his mind. He had artistic ability and
might have turned out to have been a musician or
a painter. Instead his curiosity led him to me-
chanics, mathematics, and astronomy, and we re-
member him as a scientist. Many of Galileo's ob-
servations may have no assignable results. He may
have seen that the warts on a peasant's face formed
a perfect isosceles triangle, or he may have noticed
with boyish glee that just as the officiating priest
was uttering the solemn words, ecce agnus Dei, a
fly lit on the end of his nose: All of Galelio's ob-
servation however were not as fruitless as these.
One day when a boy of seventeen he wandered into
the cathedral in his native town of Pisa. As he
watched the lamps suspended by long chains from
the high ceiling swing to and fro he wondered if
mayhap their oscillations whether long or short did
not occupy the same time. Then he tested his
hypothesis by counting his pulse for that was the
only timepiece he had. As a result of this bit of
idle curiosity on the part of Galileo has come the
highly accurate pendulum clock. Yet how many
times did you see a pendulum before you knew that
its oscillations, whether long or short occupied the
same length of time?

Here it seems to me is suggested a way for one
to get practical information. Something which the
young engineer is always complaining he lacks and
which his college course does not give him. Get
curious and observe the things about you. You
have innumerable examples of engineering prac-
tice about you. Enquire, observe and think about
them and you will be surprised at the number of
facts and ideas that you have which you have ac-
quired with so little effort and yet may some day
be so useful to vou.
EDUCATION
Every now and then we have something on the
subject of culture from the engineer: or the lack
of it. The movement seems to have its origin from
two sources, i. e., from the literary man and the
engineer himself. The literary man's version be-
ing; the engineer's mental facilities are somewhat
deadened by incessant application to logarithmic
expressions, and other forms of mental agony—
only knowing a few formulae and applications of
the same. This leads up to another version, mainly,
that the engineer should know something of the
other fellow's work—literature. The engineer sees
the justification of the latter criteria, not just for
the sake of knowing something of the other fel-
low's work, but because he actually sees the neces-
sity as life grows more complex. The result being
that the engineer has taken to a more extensive
study of rhetoric, psychology, and even philosophy.
Merely meaning that a man can be a "boilermakcr,"
and yet he can be capable of grasping the signifi-
cance of Plato's "Utopia" or Berkley's "esse est
percipi" principle. So much for the engineer. Let
us meditate a moment upon our literary brothers,
and try to see what engineers should demand of
them.
In the last two decades great advances have been
made by the engineering world; if we may choose
to be as drastic as all that, and call it a world by
itself. With this the complex problems in life have
become even more so. This is one reason for the
engineer's study of subjects which in the past were
out of the realm of his thinking. A more complex
life demands broader thinking, and it would not be
too much to ask the literary man to study a little
engineering—if for no other reason than to know
something of the other fellow's work. Let us hope
that the University College may do something to-
wards this end.
The University College, according to some re-
ports, is to go into effect next fall. The purpose
of the college being to prepare entering students
for further work in the University, and to eliminate
the undesirable members. The student's work in
the college will cover a period of two years. At
the end of two years he will have completed a gen-
eral preparatory study, which will determine
whether or not he is to continue further work at
the University. If his work is satisfactory he will
then branch off into anv one of the professional col-
leges of this institution. Let us hope that the two
years of general training will include some engi-
neering studies. Even if the student is dropped at
the end of two years, his engineering studies will
do him no harm in this scientific age.
EXAGGERATION
Wherever we go, whatever we do, we will always
find ourselves coming in contact with exaggerations
of true states of affairs. It seems to be a natural
tendency of the human race in general to attribute
more than what can easily be seen to all natural
phenomena and this attribute is immediately ex-
tended to things in general in which we find our-
selves interested. Our newspapers find themselves
especially susceptible to this common failing.
Whenever anything new is developed which it
seems that the layman should hear about our news-
papers immediately make it their duty to inform
him of what is happening and the technical man
upon reading of his work in the news is surprised
beyond comprehension to find the marvelous things
which his new development is going to accomplish
which he had not dreamed of before. A current ex-
ample of what is discussed above is the newspaper
treatment of the recently developed televox, by
means of which sound vibrations are made to oper-
ate mechanical devices. The newspapers seized this
new marvel and immediately had it doing every-
thing which might be possibly conceived, that a
device of this nature might do, by one who knew
nothing of its fundamental principles and only the
general way in which it operates. It would seem
that the newspaper men are not satisfied with the
really remarkable attributes to be found in most
modern developments but must add something in
order to make them readable to the layman. This
condition is perhaps also due to the fact that read-
ers demand something which is interesting and car-
ry the demand to the extent that they are actually
satisfied with exaggeration.
This habit of demanding exaggeration and of us-
ing it ourselves is one which we should guard
against and try to eliminate. The engineer espe-
cially will find himself in a position in which ex-
aggeration cannot be tolerated. For the engineer
works with nature. He cannot fool himself, how-
ever hard he may try and he cannot deceive the
laws of nature nor hide from them. He must be
conservative and guard his conservatism with truth
and straightforwardness.

Steel Floats Unsupported in Field of
Cobalt Magnet
A piece of steel floating unsupported in the air
was one of the scientific marvels which greeted the
eyes of visitors to the Westinghouse Electric and
Manufacturing Company's display at the Radio
World's Fair in the New Madison Square Garden,
September 19 to 24.
Only a thin wire, serving as an anchor to keep
the steel from escaping, was attached. With that
exception, the bar, which was six inches long,
one-half inch wide and one-half inch thick, had ab-
solutely no visible means of support.
The answer to the mystery is spelled by the
word "magnetism." Below the floating bar was
a companion piece of steel of similar size and com-
position, and the two bars, magnetized with like
poles opposite, were held apart by the magnetic
repulsion between them, which exceeds the force
of gravity.
The material used was cobalt steel alloyed with
tungstown, which, according to Westinghouse en-
gineers, forms the strongest permanent magnet
known. The alloy was developed by Dr. P. H.
Brace, Westinghouse research engineer, after
months of experimentation in the laboratory.
The new alloy is so highly magnetized that,
when used as horseshoe magnet, it will lift a bar
thirty times its own weight, representing a strength
five times that of the ordinary magnet, according
to Dr. Brace. In addition, the alloy clings tena-
ciously to its magnetic power and will not lose it.
Cobalt steel such as is used is relatively ex-
pensive. It will be used only where performance
is worth more than price, as in delicate meters, fine
phonographs and such precise machines as the
Westinghouse oscillograph or "Osiso."—Westing-
house Press Service.
What Is Static Pressure?
The best way fully to understand what static
pressure is, is to draw a parallel between the elec-
tric generator, which generates electric current, and
the fan, which is essentially a generator or air cur-
rent. When we have to send the electric current
furnished by an electric generator into a circuit
having a high resistance, the electric generator
must be able to develop a voltage high enough to
overcome the electric resistance of the electric
circuit.
Static pressure is for a fan exactly what volt-
age is for an electric generator. That is. static
pressure (S. P.) is the tension factor for the air
current in the same way that voltage is the ten-
sion factor for the electric current; the volume of
air delivered by the fan per unit of time (C.F.M.)
being exactly the equivalent of amperage furnished
by the electric generator.
When a fan has to secure the circulation of air
through a certain air circuit, it must be able to de-
velop the necessary static pressure to overcome the
different resistances in its path. For air currents
these resistances appear in the shape of friction
against the walls of air ducts, changes of direction
of the air current (bends in ducts), variation of the
section available for the air flow, vortices and eddv
currents created by different obstacles to the air
flow, etc.
To speak about a fan without any reference to
its static pressure is thus a physical anomaly. One
can form a judgment about a fan (generator of air
current) only if both its characteristic factors, the
C.F.M. and S.P., are specified.
When a fan furnishes static pressure, it not only
communicates a certain velocity to the air but it
also compresses the air. The density of the air
delivered by a fan furnishing static pressure actu-
ally is higher behind the fan—defined in relation
to the sense of air flow—as compared to the density
in front of it. In other words, the air, when pass-
ing through a fan furnishing static pressure, has
its density somewhat increased.
The air delivered by a fan furnishing static pres-
sure continues to move forward after having passed
the fan, not only on account of the velocity ac-
quired, but also by expansion. This is the case
when the fan is forcing air from the free atmos-
phere into a certain system. That is why such air
currents can well pass through bends, where most
of the air velocity is lost, because it continues to
move by expansion after passing same. In a case
where a fan is exhausting air, the phenomena are
reversed. The air is set in motion by the depres-
sion created in front of the fan and the air pres-
sure is again brought up to the normal level of
the free atmosphere after passing through the fan,
When we have air in a piston and compress it


Page 27
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
by a piston—say, in a bicycle pump—this com-
pression is attained statically, viz., by a direct push
on the air by the piston. But a fan compresses the
air dynamically, that is. by impact of the blades
against the air. The blades in rapid rotation hit
the air and not only set it is motion but also com-
press it. And if the fan is so built that one blade
follows the other quickly enough so that the air
compressed dynamically by one blade has not the
time to leak backwards in the space between the
blades, the air will stay compressed.
One readily can understand that such dynamical
air compression is a very subtle phenomenon, and
a profound knowledge of laws of air resistance is
necessary to accomplish it successfully and with
high efficiency. But one can easily see that it is
quite impossible to attain such air compression by
a fan not having a sufficient number of blades. In
such cases, the intervals between the blades are
out of proportion to the blades themselves and
most of the air slightly compressed by the motion
of each blade leaks backward in the spaces be-
tween the blades.
An air propeller is in no sense a fan. Exactly
speaking, it is something just opposite to a fan.
A propeller is designed with the purpose of fur-
nishing a powerful thrust with high efficiency.
The ventilation phenomenon connected with the
operation of a propeller constitutes a loss. Learned
propeller designers call it the slip velocity loss. And
certainly, in any kind of apparatus, in order to
get a high efficiency, one must reduce the losses.
Thus a highly-efficient propeller must be a low-
efficiency fan. otherwise it could not be a highly-
efficient propeller. But what is a loss for a pro-
peller constitutes precisely the useful action for
a fan. A fan must be so designed to produce a
large flow of air, because that is just the factor we
want to utilize, with complete disregard to the axi-
al thrust furnished by a fan which, in the case of
a fan, is only harmful because of the wearing out
of the bearings produced by it.
Thus, a good fan must be a bad propeller. The
fact that standing in the slip stream produced by
an air propeller feels like a very strong air cur-
rent does not mean anything, because we must
compare the power of the air current to the power
of the engine producing it. Aeroplane engines are
very powerful engines so it is not surprising that
although propellers are fans of very low efficiency.
they still produce powerful air currents, but they
produce them very wastefully.
The same slip streams created by a propeller
could be produced by a high efficiency fan with
much less power, but such a fan would be a poor
propeller for the propulsion of an aeroplane. And
no one should be surprised by such a state of af-
fairs.—Dr. George De Bothezat in Heating and
Ventilating Magazine.
Color By Wire
It has been reported that a new invention at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology makes pos-
sible the matching of colors by wire or radio. Exact
reproductions of any shade can be made without
the possibility of visual error, thus advancing the
industries from dependence upon the human eye.
The color specimen is placed in a holder close
to a high power electric lamp. Light is alternated
from it and a block of magnesium carbonate, the
whitest of the world's substances, and variation of
reflection from these two surfaces is registered by
a photo electric cell and transmitted in electrical
impulses by either wire or radio.—Interstate News.
Quartz Crystal Controls Frequency
At the Radio World's Fair held September 19
to 24 at the New Madison Square Garden, radio
fans were afforded an opportunity to see for them-
selves how one of the greatest boons to radio recep-
tion—frequency control—is made possible. This
was demonstrated as part of the feature display of
the \Vestinghouse Electric and Manufacturing
Company.
Interference in reception, according to radio en-
gineers, is due to a large extent to the inability
of broadcasting station to keep rigidly to the
wave lengths assigned by the Federal Radio Com-
mission. With stations separated from each other
by differences of only 10 kilocycles in their wave-
lengths, even a slight wandering from its assigned
frequency will cause one station to conflict with
another, with the result that a shriek or howl is-
sues from the receiving set.
The solution of the problem, Westinghouse ex-
perts claim, is found in the Piezo quartz crystal
oscillator, developed in Westinghouse laboratories
and now equipped on several transmitters of West-
inghouse Station KDKA. The Piezo crystal, it is
claimed, has the property of vibrating at a fixed
frequency, thus guaranteeing against any change
in wavelength. If any change does occur, the sta-
tion shuts down, but it can neVer slide off its as-
signed frequency and interfere with other stations.
In demonstrating the device at the radio show, a
miniature transmitting set was set up, and by an
arrangement of swinging pendulums, the general
method of controlling a set by means of a Piezo
crvstal was made clear.
France Soon to Develop Rhine Power
Work is at last about to be started on the har-
nessing of the Rhine for power purposes between
IJasle and Strassburg. This development will ne-
cessitate the construction of a canal between Strass-
burg and Kembs, so as to make it possible for
barges to proceed the entire way from Rotterdam

to Basle instead of finishing their journey, as at
present, at Mannheim or Strasbourg.
The concession for the construction of the Kembs
power station was granted to the Societe des For-
ces Motrices du Haut-Rhin by Switzerland about
three years ago and by the French government un-
der a law of last July. It lasts for 75 years from
the date of completion. The dam is to be con-
structed at the expense of the French government
and under the stipulations of the treaty of Ver-
sailles, which permits it to make use of the Rhine
water and execute on the German bank all the
works required for the exercise of the right, besides
giving it the exclusive right to the power derived,
subject to payment to Germany of the value of
one-half the power actually produced.
Seven months of the year the flow of the Rhine
exceeds 850 cu. in. per second, with a gradient of
one m. per km., which represents for each km.
utilized some 10,000 hp., or three times that of the
Rhone above Lyons. The dam to be built 5l/» km.
below the Swiss frontier will raise the water level
seven meters on the average. By means of sluices
the level of the Rhine will be regulated, and also
that of the canal, which is designed for a flow of
850 cu. m. at an average of 0.70 m. per second.
This canal will have a length of approximately 7
km.; its depth is to be 7 meters, and at the side
of the Kembs powerhouse there will be two locks,
one of 185 m. and the other of 100 m. in length,
with a breadth in each case of 25 m. Below the
station the canal will rejoin the river.
The Kembs station itself will be located at the
Northern end of the new canal and will take ad-
vantage of a fall of water of some eleven meters
to operate turbines, and its average power will be
120,000 hp. The average monthly output will ap-
proximate 54.000 kw. The current will be sold in
the eastern regions, which are estimated to be
easily able to absorb it all. As the canal is ex-
tended, other power stations will be erected, the
present plans embracing eight in all. The Kembs
station is to take five years to complete, at a total
cost of about $12,000,000.
Trane Test
The Trane Company has carried out tests and
has obtained some very interesting data as regards
the time required to heat a given room with a heat
cabinet as compared to a cast iron radiator.
The tests were run in a room measuring IS^x
20,'^xll feet. A 28 sq. ft. 26x30 inch, heat cabinet
and a cast iron radiator of the same capacity, and as
nearly the same dimensions, were installed along-
side of each other. Thermometers were suspended
at floor and ceiling levels at various points in the
room, and readings were taken first with the radi-
ator in operation and then with the heat cabinet.
Care was taken to run these tests under as nearly
identical conditions as possible.
The results showed a time lag of from sixteen to
twenty minutes at the ceiling level and from ten to
twenty minutes at the floor—comparing readings
with the cast iron radiator to those with the heat
cabinet. This gives an average temperature lag of
eighteen minutes at the ceiling and fifteen minutes
at the floor. The lesser time lag at the floor was
due to the radiant effect of the cast iron radiator on
the low thermometers.
At the end of a forty-minute period temperature
readings became practically constant, and we found
that while operating with the heat cabinet the ceil-
ing temperatures averaged 1.2 lower than those ob-
tained with the cast iron radiator, while the floor
temperatures averaged 1.7 higher.
Since data is known showing the time required
for a heat cabinet to produce full heat, it will be
comparativeK simple to determine the time re-
quired for a cast iron radiator to reach its full ca-
pacity. The heat output being directly proportional
to the temperature of the radiator—the time ele-
ments become dependent on the specific heats of
copper and iron and upon the mass or weights of
each for a given capacity. The specific heat of cop-
per is .093; and of iron it is .11. The weight of a
cast iron radiator per square foot being approxi-
mately 6l/2 pounds, a 50 sq. ft. radiator would have
a mass of 325 pounds. Multiplying the mass by the
specific heat shows us that 35.7 B.T.U. will be re-
quired to raise the temperature of the cast iron
radiator one degree.
A heater in a 38x42 inch Trane heat cabinet rated
at 52 sq. ft. weighs 21 pounds. The heat, therefore,
required to raise the temperature of a copper heater
one degree will be 21x.093, or 1.95 B.T.U. A ratio
of 35.7 to 1.95 gives us 18.3, which is the ratio of the
time element of a cast iron radiator as compared to
a heat cabinet.
In brief, the results of the tests show that it re-
quires from thirteen to twenty minutes longer to
heat a room to a given temperature with a cast iron
radiator than with a heat cabinet. Also, if twenty-
five seconds are required for a given cabinet to
come up to full capacity, approximately 18 times
this, or 7l/2 minutes will be required for a cast iron
radiator of equal capacity to come up to its rating.

''Twas a dark and stormy night." as the story
goes. But then, what's a little rain among engi-
neers—from the turnout and the enthusiasm at the
engineering smoker—nothing.
After the last engineer had arrived, a few more
sauntered in to complete the crowd, and to in-
crease the density of the already Pittsburghian at-
mosphere. Things were pepped up a bit by music
and song under the batoned hand of Ralph Ehlers,
'27E. Song predominated until Mary Ann Mc-
Carthy had again found an oyster, when the lime-
light was switched to Stewart Churchill, who en-
tertained the gang with several selections on the
marimbaphone. He sure knows his notes, as the
number of encores indicated.
Someone has said that humor is the best physic.
Whether or not castor oil was prevalent in those
days, we don't know. Anyway, Prof. Duffendack
of the Physics Department proceeded to set up the
incongruous by boiling a liquid on ice, burning car-
bon while submerged in the same liquid with a
temperature of less than —200° Centigrade, mak-
ing brittle spaghetti from a rubber band, and im-
parting to a coil of lead wire some of the elastic
properties of a steel spring—all with the aid of
liquid air.
Dean Cooley was on hand to introduce the speak-
er of the evening, Mr. John F. Stephens, a promi-
nent consulting engineer of Philadelphia. Mr.
Stephens is one of the most outstanding engineers
of the world. He has been very active in engi-
neering circles, having been chief engineer of the
Panama Canal, the Soo Canal, and for the Great
Northern Railroad.
Mr. Stephens contrasted the engineering educa-
tion of the past with that of today, pointing out
the many advantages of the modern technical
training over that of the past.
He stated that with the advance of time the en-
gineer will be called upon to assume the responsi-
bility of leadership more and more in the army of
progress, because of the increasing application of
scientific principles to every phase of life.
To the student, he said that with graduation
studies have just begun; that to remain abreast
with the progress of time, the engineer must con-
tinue to study diligently; and that the engineer
who fails in that respect can never be a success.
He asserted that the outlook of the future is
bright, but the way hard, "Therefore—a message to
the young engineer," he said. "Have faith—faith
in yourself and the shadowy future; and in the
words of the old German poet, 'Go forth without
fear in your manly heart.' Remember that by the
sweat of your brow, you shall obtain bread. And
remember, too, that in the last analysis, there is
but one perfect rule to follow, one which should
guide your professional as well as your every walk
of life, 'Do unto others as ye would that they should
do unto you.'"
After the speech the meeting became a mixer.
Cider, doughnuts, and smokes went the rounds.
Each man proceeded to enjoy life as he saw fit.
Chemical Engineering Department
The American Gas Association has appropriated
$10,000.00 to the Department of Engineering Re-
search to be used for research purposes during this
year. The project is to investigate the value of
gas as a heating medium for furnaces in which steel
is to be forged. This work is being performed by
Mr. Walter E. Jominy. Associate Investigator in
Engineering Research. Forging furnaces are usu-
ally heated with coal. But the demand for higher
quality forgings presents a question as to whether
or not a better quality can be produced using gas
as a fuel.
The superiority of gas lies in the ease of con-
trol of the chemical constituents of the gases which
surround the steel, and also in a better control of
temperature. There is some evidence to show that
steel burns at a lower temperature in an oxidizing
atmosphere. It is expected that Mr. Jominy will
find out whether this assumption is correct and
whether gas does give a better grade of forging
than either coal or oil.
The Michigan Gas Association has also appro-
priated $10,000.00 to the department for the pur-
pose of research work during the coming year. The
problem is to study the value of soft coal for use
in the manufacture of water gas. Soft coal is
cheaper than coke but does not behave so well in
the water gas generator. Mr. Pettyjohn who is

On the evening of October 20th, 1927, a group
of students interested in the problem of transpor-
tation met for the purpose of organizing themselves
into a more substantial body. Such an organiza-
tion has been formed in various other universities
in the United States, notably at Illinois and Har-
vard. The purpose of the club is mainly to pro-
vide the suitable contact for students with current
problems- of transportation.
The following committees have been formed
since the Club first met:
Membership:
Herbert Seaman, '28E. Chairman
Derwood Rossman, '28E
Earl A. Kloster, '30
Publicity:
C. A, McClosky, '29, Chairman
Albert Cook, '28E
Jas. B. Osborn, '30E
Hospitality:
Harold W. Kellog. '28E, Chairman
W. A. Smith, '29E
P. T. Hopkins. '28E
Trips:
Clark E. Harris. Grad E, Chairman
Wm. L. Chase, '28
Donald J. Bullock, '28E
The Club thus far has had considerable success
in all its undertakings. On Nov. 9th, Mr. H. C.
Dallman, deputy state highway commissioner, and
chief engineer, spoke before the members of the
Club on the subject of "State Highways in Michi-
gan." In his address, Mr. Dallman brought out
the problems of construction and detail work that
the State Highway Department has had to meet,
and those which it will have to meet in the future.
Saturday morning, Nov. 26th, twenty of the
members of the Club made a trip to Toledo where
they inspected the New York Central Railroad
round house and wheel foundry. Prof. Sadler ac-
companied the members in their inspection.
Monday evening, Nov. 28th, in co-operation with
the other engineering societies on the campus, the
Transportation Club held a smoker in the ballroom
of the Michigan Union. Mr. John F. Stephens, the
noted engineer who constructed the Panama Ca-
nal, was the speaker of the evening. On Dec. 12th,
the Club had for its speaker, Mr. Gardiner Wil-
liams.
The Transportation Club has taken a very active
part in the few months that it has existed. Fu-
ture plans are on foot for inspection trips to Jack-
son, Detroit, and Wyandotte. In the spring, the
Club hopes to be able to make trips to Buffalo
via the D. &amp; C. Navigation boat, "The City of
Buffalo III." Prominent speakers are expected to
address the Club in the very near future.
Membership of the Club is open to all students
of the University. At the present time the mem-
bership totals sixty men. The success of the Club


Page 31
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
has been due largely to the work of Professors
Worley and Sadler of the Transportation Club, and
to Mr. P. M. Shoemaker, the president of the Club.
Aero Club
Due to the fact that the Aero Society holds stock
in the Detroit Balloon Club, it is possible for the
members of the Society to take nights in a free
balloon. Shortly after school opened last fall four
of the boys from the Aero Club made a flight with
the balloon from Wyandotte, Mich. They took
off shortly after midnight and landed near Water-
town, N. Y., before noon the same day. They had
a very enjoyable trip over Canada and two of the
Great Lakes. They averaged about forty miles per
hour for the entire trip. A few weeks later five
of the members took another trip from Wyandotte
and landed on the southern shore of Lake Huron
in Canada. All of the members of the Society are
very enthusiastic about this exciting sport.
At the first meeting of the Aero Society, Eddie
Hill and Art Schlosser talked to the club about
ballooning and how they won the International
Balloon Race which gives them the Gordon Ben
nett Trophy for one year. The Gordon Bennett
Trophy Race is the most important race of the
year and is usually attended by the most skillful
balloonists of the world. Eddie Hill and Art
Schlosser, this year's winners, are two young engi-
neers living in Detroit.
Mr. I. H. Driggs, of Lansing, was the speaker
at the last meeting of the Society. He is one of
the prominent aeroplane designers and builders of
the country. Mr. Driggs was the first man to in-
troduce the "Light Plane" into the United States.
A. I. E. E.
The University of Michigan Branch of the Amer-
ican Institute of Electrical Engineers has started
off on what seems to be a very interesting year.
The first meeting of the fall semester was held
November 9. Dr. E. F. Barker of the Physics De-
partment, spoke on some of the interesting things
of atomic structure. The next meeting was held
on December 9. At that meeting Mr. E. E. Dreese,
a former member of the electrical engineering fac-
ulty and now chief engineer for the Lincoln Elec-
tric Company, gave a talk, the subject of which
was, "Imaginative Engineering." The attendance
at each of these meetings was about forty.
Mr. H. D. James, of the Westinghouse Electrical
Manufacturing Company, is going to give a talk
on the Westinghouse Control Engineering Depart-
ment, at a meeting to be held on January 18.
The programs for the rest of the meetings for
the year are not yet definitely arranged, but several
interesting men will speak at them.
Besides the regular monthly meetings of the
student branch, a number of the members found it
decidedly worth while to attend the meetings of
the Detroit-Ann Arbor Section of the A. I. E. E.
At the first meeting this fall Prof. B. F. Bailey, of
the Electrical Engineering Department, spoke on
the Condenser Motor with which he has been
working. The meeting at Jackson, at which sev-
eral of the engineers of the Detroit Edison Com-
pany and the Consumers Power Company spoke on
the various features of the line interconnecting
these two companies, was of particular interest to
the student members as it gave them somewhat of
the point of view of the practicing engineers on
subjects which the student studies in the class-
room.
The A. I. E. E. is also co-operating with other
student branches in putting on meetings like the
engineering smoker which was held in the Union
on November 29.
A. S, C. E.
The Michigan chapter of the American Society
of Civil Engineers have to date followed their usual
program. Regular meetings have been held each
month. The majority of these were dinner meet-
ings held at the Union. For the main speakers on
these occasions the society secured men who have a
name in the civil engineering world and also promi-
nent professors of other colleges on the campus.
The local chapter of the A. S. C. E., unlike many
other organizations, carries out the idea, that only
students of marked scholarship and character
should be chosen. This fall the following men
were selected from the list of cligibles:
Juniors:
L. W. Fitch
J. A. Hapke
L. D. Kirschner
A. J. Paddock
R. H. Shakelton
Seniors:
M. Mains
M. Thompson
H. Seaman
G. Platz
J. Daiber
C. Lisle
D. Brummit
A. Van Pelt
G. Miles
J. Wood
At a banquet at which the faculty members of
C. E. Department were present, these men were
formally initiated.
For the coming year the society has planned be-
sides its regular monthly meetings, several joint
dinner meetings with the faculty. The purpose or
idea of these meetings is to bring about a better
understanding between students and faculty.
Engineering Debating Society
The Engineering Debating Society, organized in
the spring of 1927 through the efforts of Prof. F.
N, Menefee, has been holding some interesting

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
meetings Tuesday evenings at the Michigan Union.
A varied assortment of topics has been discussed,
including such widely divergent subjects as "The
Art of J. M. Whistler" and "The Gag Rule in the
Army and Navy."
This fall the Club has had the expert advice of
Mr. R. I). Brackett of the Engineering English De-
partment. Mr. Brackett has had much experience
in this type of work and he, as well as others in-
terested in the engineering profession, feels that
the Club will become a very active one in a short
time.
A number of interesting programs have been
planned for the second semester, including a so-
cial meeting at which a practicing engineer will
speak.

Continuance of the extraordinary influx of popu-
lation and the growth of industry and agriculture-
all indicate that demand will increase rapidly. The
decrease in the amount of construction, Major Ed-
gerton believes, is a result of interconnection. This
has increased the effectiveness of existing facilities
to such an extent that a temporary falling off of
construction has resulted.—Power.
Oklahoma Boiler Code Being Simplified
The Oklahoma boiler code, which is the law al-
lowing the state labor commissioner to regulate
boilers for the prevention of explosions and disas-
ters at industrial plants, is being revised by the la-
bor commission, W. A. Murphy, commissioner,
announced, Oct. 21.
In revising the statutes, many phrases will be
simplified and many unnecessary clauses eliminated,
Commissioner Murphy said, as the present code is
difficult to understand.
"None of the rules will be eliminated in the re-
vision," Murphy said. "The revision is only for
the purpose of simplifying the language."
The state laws give to the commissioner the au-
thority to make such rules as he believes should
apply for the safety of boiler workers.—Power.
ARCHITECTURAL MODELS
(Continued from puge 12)
a good silhouette against the sky. It is nearly
impossible to design a building on paper in two
dimensions that is sure to look well in perspective
as it will actually be seen when built.
\Vhile speaking of the building in perspective it
is also necessary to take into consideration its set-
ting. The newest idea in connection with model-
making is the combining of a photograph of the
model with a photograph of the site. The result
is a picture of the proposed building as it will look
when built. To do this, the site is surveyed and
photographed from various viewpoints which arc
identified by pegs driven into the ground and by-
triangulated measurements from existing build-
ings. Pictures of the model are then taken to con-
form with those of the site, the viewpoints agree-
ing to scale with the ones on the site.
A good example of this usage is found in the
designing of the "Ritz Tower" in Xew York City.
Here the photographer, model-maker, and the ar-
chitect worked together throughout.
Now that the architectural model has become
more and more popular, the architect and his cli-
ent may depend upon a better and more thorough
understanding between themselves.
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE ENGINEER

solutely valueless without the directing genius of
the human brain.
Much valuable research can be done without
physical equipment if in the hands of men of gen-
ius and ability. Research, therefore, offers real
opportunities for the young man of today. It is
a field which is just beginning to come into its
own and which will be found to possess an ever
increasing opportunity. Those planning to enter
this field should appreciate that their most valu-
able tools are a thorough grounding in fundamen-
tals. Those expecting to enter the field of Engi-
neering Research should by all means have a thor-
ough grounding in such lines as physics, chem-
istry and mathematics, because all engineering
work, particularly research work in engineering,
goes back to these three fields of natural science.
THE COVER DESIGN
The cover design for this issue of the Michigan
Technic is the work of William B. Weiner, '28A.
The subject is one of Venice, called "The House of
the Desdemone" on the grand canal. Mr. Weiner
spent many weeks traveling through Europe
sketching beautiful and unusual architectural feat-'
ures of the old world that have seldom been
sketched by American students, and has obligingly
contributed this drawing of a typical Venetian
home for our January issue.
Among other things, Mr. Weiner has accom-
plished a great deal in the way of zinc etchings.
Especially is he familiar with the architecture of
the south, as he is a native of Louisiana.
The Technic is very fortunate in being able to
secure such excellent material for its cover illus-
tration, and wishes to thank Mr. Weiner for his
contribution.

Echoes from the Graduates
PROF. BENJAMIN F. BAILEY
FIRST impression of Professor Benjamin F. job gave Professor Bailey unusual opportunity and
Z\ Bailey, head of the department of Electrical
-*• -^- Engineering, is a lasting one. He is a rather
portly gentleman, gray haired, and has a smile upon
his face almost continually. He is endowed with
the ability to become sincerely interested in al-
most anything one may have to say to him. It is
this quality which inspires great
confidence in both students and
others who come to talk things
over with him, or get his advice
or opinion on some subject.
This is a rare quality in profes-
sors, most of them are either too
busy to talk to you, or they have
little or no desire to bother with
you. Professor Bailey has
dropped completely the strict
formality and decorum generally
adopted by men of such high po-
sition. Recognized as o n e of
the country's greatest electrical
engineering professor s, and
much sought for his advice on
anything pertaining to the sub-
ject, Professor Bailey becomes,
indeed, an apt subject for a bi-
ography.
Benjamin Franklin Bailey
was born at Sheridan, Michigan,
August 7, 1875. He entered the
Engineering School of the University of Michigan
at the age of 19, and was graduated with the de-
gree of B. S. in 1898. He went to Detroit imme-
diately after his graduation, and accepted a job
with the Detroit Edison Illuminating Company,
where he worked as a switchboard designer, and
did work on structural steel construction. Inci-
dentally, Henry Ford was also working for the
same company at this time, and was known as
"The Chief of the Engines"; he was chief engineer
at the power plant. After working there for sev-
eral months, he went to Schenectady, New York,
where he obtained a position in the testing de-
partment of The General Electric Company. This
PROF. BENJAMIN F. BAILEY
desire to develop and experiment with numerous
ideas which he had concerning electrical appli-
ances and inventions. The wide scope of the field
of electrical engineering was presented to him in
its vastness for the first time in the great plant
and laboratories of The General Electric Com-
pany. His interest waxed to a
high pitch in the various tests
and experiments which he per-
formed as part of his duties. He
saw the need of greater knowl-
edge than he possessed at that
time, and returned to the Uni-
versity after about a year to
resume his studies. He received
his degree of A. M. in 1900.
The beginning of his present
career in electrical engineering
was marked by his acceptance
of an instructor's position in
Electrotherapeutics the follow-
ing fall.
He married Elsie Marion Eg-
geman on January 20, 1902, and
took up his residence at Ann Ar-
bor. They have one child, a
son.
Professor Bailey obtained his
assistant professorship in 1906,
and was given the degree of
Ph. D. the following year. Soon afterward he fin-
ished his work on the development of an electric
ignition, starting, and lighting system for automo-
biles. The automobile industry was in its infancy
at that time, and new developments and inventions
were appearing rapidly. His system, while it was
a very marked improvement upon those in use at
the time, was held up by a long lawsuit on pat-
ent rights, and was late in making its appearance.
He also has done much work on the development
of starting and lighting equipment since that time.
He has been much in demand as an adviser upon
patent cases of similar nature.
Professor Bailey was made a junior professor in


January, 1928
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
1910, and began work on his first treatise in elec-
trical engineering. The volume appeared in 1911
with the title of Induction Motors. Two years
later he became a professor of electrical engineer-
ing. He concentrated his efforts, for a time, on
the improvement and expansion of the courses
offered. He became head of the department in 1922,
and has since done all in his power to elevate it
to the high status it occupies today.
Professor Bailey's first book, Induction Motors,
which appeared in 1903, was at that time a com-
plete work upon the subject, and was regarded
very favorably by all who used it.
His last work, Dynamo Electric Machinery, ap-
peared in 1915. It is a thorough text upon the
subject, and its merit is such that it is still in use
today.
In 1918 Professor Bailey was made a director
of The Howell Electric Motor Company, and acts
in the capacity of consulting engineer, as well as
a member of the board of directors. He was also
vice-president and director of The Fremont Motor
Corporation, and was a director of The Bailey
Electric Company during its life.
A few years ago, The Detroit Edison Company-
secured his services in doing research work on
single phase condenser type induction motors. He
formulated a plan of attack, and immediately start-
ed work on the problem. After many tedious tests
and long experiments, he was successful in pro-
ducing a remarkable improvement upon single
phase induction motors. The Howell Electric
Motor Company secured the patent rights and is
now engaged in marketing this new development,
along with The General Electric Co. and several
others. It is a plain squirrel-cage type motor which
has cooling fins on the rotor. It operates without
a commutator, brushes, or other devices of this
nature. Much of the inefficient operation of frac-
tional horse power electric motors may be traced
directly to faulty commutation. The motor em-
ploys special types of condensors in its construc-
tion. The unusually high efficiency and high pow-
er factor of the new motor make it superior to the
present polyphase types, although single phase
motors have been considered inferior up to this
time. The low current consumption of the new
motor makes it unusually advantageous as a re-
frigerator motor, in which capacity a large num-
ber of them will be used. The intermittent man-
ner in which the motors on home refrigerators turn
on and off is a serious detriment to maintaining
constant voltage along home power lines as is evi-
denced by the blinking of electric lights in com-
munities in which a large number of electric re-
frigerators are in operation. These new motors
will be an important aid in remedying this situa-
tion. They are being manufactured in sizes from
fractional horse power up to thirty horse power
units. Since over one hundred thousand refrig-
erator motors are manufactured monthly in this
country, the market for such an improved type is
enormous.
Professor Bailey is as great a success socially as
he is professionally. He can always be counted
upon to give an interesting and amusing after-din-
ner speech as well as read papers upon important
research which he has conducted. He was a mem-
ber of the Society of Automobile Engineers, and
a fellow of the American Institute of Electrical
Engineers. He was elected to Tau Beta Pi sev-
eral years ago and has since been elected to Sig-
ma Xi for his research work. His prowess as a
golfer is known to many members of The Bar-
ton Hills Country Club, where he spends many of
his free hours in relaxation.
• The head of Michigan's Electrical Engineering
Department believes that electricity has but be-
gun to open its box of wonders, and that in the
future it will find many new uses and methods to
lighten the burden of mankind.

THE TELEVOX
(Continued from paffe 19)
is installed by the telephone company and furnisho
the initiating means for the rest of the substation
equipment. The relay makes contact when the
bell rings, thus energizing the magnet which lifts
the weight from the hook switch and completes the
circuit to the amplifying tube filaments. After an
interval of about thirty seconds during which the
substation buzzer sends out the station code at in-
tervals, the actuating circuits will be opened by a
timing device unless the dispatcher sends one or
more 1400 cycle tones. This is to take care of
wrong number calls which are inevitable as long
as human beings use the telephone.
For portable use the device can be operated bv
three carefully tuned pitch pipes of the proper tones.
This enables the line repair man to operate the sub-
station breakers from any telephone in private
houses or pay stations near the case of trouble.
Testing of defective circuits is thus greatly ex-
pedited.
Means are available for reading meters, ascer-
taining the height of water in reservoirs, reading
the temperature of transformers or other devices
or in fact doing almost anything that needs to be
done in the controlling of a distant substation.
Inquiry is frequently made as to the possibility
of interference from the high frequency tones used
in the Telavox. A little reflection will reveal the
fact that the tones used are within those normally
used in voice transmission. The volume is lim-
ited by the ability cf the telephone transmitter to
convert sound into electrical vibrations. The Tele-
x-ox therefore will not create any interference un-
less the circuit is so bad that cross-talk exists during
ordinary conversation. This condition is not al-
lowed to continue very long after the telephone
company learns of it. And so we can answer with
entire confidence that the Televox will not cause
any more interference than ordinary conversation.
There will be many uses for Televox that are not
apparent at this time. There must be many places
where inexpensive remote control would fill a real
need were the expense of control circuits elim-
inated. Such applications will undoubtedly d e-
velop as the capabilities of the Televox become
better known.

the field, "3XN, the experimental radio broadcast-
ing station of Bell Telephone Laboratories, located
at Wippany, X. J.," as the announcer informed you.
Tucked away over beyond the Orange Mountains
of New Jersey, about twenty-two miles by air line
from New York, is this latest step in broadcasting.
For months, it has been a very busy spot, although
it has been quiet as far as the ether is concerned,
except on certain Friday evenings. When it has
gone on the air, though, radio listeners in practical-
ly every state in the United States, in far-away
Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, down in warm
Bermuda and in frozen Alaska have picked up the
new 50,000 watt station and have written in com-
menting on the quality of reception.
Just what advances in the art does this newest
set bring out? The engineers tell us that some of
the new features include one hundred per cent mod-
ulation, crystal control of frequency stability, un-
usual elimination of harmonics and new and elabo-
rate safety devices for the operators. Instead of
trying to comprehend all of these new engineering
terms, let's take a look behind the scenes at Whip-
pany and see what we can see for ourselves.
We first come upon a big power transformer lo-
cated outside of the main building. This provides
the power of 250 K. W. at 440 volts—60 cycles,
three phase current that the twenty-five vacuum
tubes of this transmitter use. Fourteen of these big
tubes are water-cooled by water jackets surround-
ing the plates. We find that the circulating water
goes through big radiators that look like the radi-
ators on our automobiles except for the size. And
even the familiar fan is there to cool the water.
Here stand ten large panels that look innocent
enough from the front but we are told that flowing
into these amplifier tubes there are 17,000 volts of
direct current supplied by a group of rectifier tubes.
To insure the safety of the operating staff against
high voltages, exceptional protective measures have
been developed and incorporated in the set, so that
no matter what panel or door is opened the high
voltage is not only shut off but all of the high volt-
age parts are grounded.
Over in one of the panels we are shown the small
quartz crystal that, in comparison to the other
pieces of equipment, looks like a midget. But it is
this little device that maintains constant frequency
so that in complying with the Federal Radio Com-
mission assignment of frequency (wave length) the
station is always "on its wave length."
Then there is still another feature of this new
broadcaster that listeners-in have commented on in
their letters. That is the lack of noise and static.
For just a fleeting moment, when we heard about
it, we thought that possibly a new static eliminator
had been developed. We found out, however, that
there are two features involved in this apparent
elimination. The step of from 5000 watts to 50,000
watts was decided upon in order that the radio
broadcast listeners might be given the proper kind
of radio reception. If the signal strength received
in your sets is so small that considerable amplifica-
tion is required, you immediately amplify all of the
other noises that arc "heat in" your set with the
carrier wave. But the higher power transmitter
gives stronger signals; and the newly developed
circuits give the hundred per cent modulation,
which, in turn, gives greater signal strength in pro-
portion to the carrier and the noise which it picks
up. Thus you get the proper level of received sig-
nal strength to override most of the noise and static,
leaving you with clear reception and wonderful
quality. We found also that in order to take care
of the peaks of modulation, 200,000 watts are re-
quired and provided for in this set, meaning, there-
fore, that the average normal modulated output to
the antenna is far above the rated 50,000 watts.
In short, this new broadcaster looks to us like
just about the last word in broadcasting develop-
ment.

No Substitute for M&lt;nir/&lt;inc#e in Steel
In the manufacture of steel, no satisfactory sub-
stitute for manganese is known, declares the United
States Bureau of Mines. In Germany during the
years 1917 and 1918, the shortage of manganese
necessitated trial of many substitutes, such as alum-
inum in the form of silicon-aluminum alloys. Alum-
inum has a greater affinity for oxygen than manga-
nese, but the oxidization of aluminum produces
alumina which is relatively infusible and often re-
mains in the steel as slag inclusions. Aluminum can-
not eliminate sulphur or change the condition of
sulphur as manganese can. A slight excess of alumi-
num tends to produce large pipes in the ingots.
Silicon in the form of ferrosilicon probably has a
greater affinity for oxygen than manganese, but
its use is attended by the following disadvantages:
In slight excess it causes large pipes to form in in-
gots; the products of oxidation remain in the steel;
it has no effect upon sulphur and no effect on the
molecular arrangement of the metal. Ferrotitanium
is the most powerful deoxidizer known. Titanium
does not alloy freely with iron and imparts to steel
qualities that are not acceptable to the trade. Cal-
cium, sodium, vanadium and boron alloys have been
tried as deoxidizers, but homogeneous steel was
not produced when they were used.

TRAINING THE ENGINEER FOR INDUSTRIAL
LEADERSHIP
By PROFESSOR HENRY E. Rior.s
DURING the fifteen years that the writer the total number of men available for railroad con-
has been in educational work he has many struction work, or for the government survey work
times had occasion to ask himself whether was extremely small in comparison with the pres-
the courses prescribed in our engineering schools ent day output of graduates.

the present day and age.
An examination of the cur-
ricula will disclose the fact that
they are modeled in a general
way upon the curricula of forty
or more years ago, but that
such changes as have 1&gt; e e n
made have been principally in
the way of adding specialized
courses in some field of engi-
neering. The four-year course
has been adhered to, but more
"hours" have been put into the
requirement for graduation.
During the early years of en-
gineering education in America
the demand upon the colleges
was for technicians, men skilled
in surveying and in design. The
country needed, during the
years between the Civil War,
and the end of the great period
PROF. HENRY E. RIGGS
There is no question that the
training given in those early
years of Michigan was good
training. The success of the
alumni proves that. The large
proportion of the graduates
who not only made good, but
who achieved eminence in the
profession, is the very best evi-
dence not alone of the inspir-
ing qualities of the teachers,
but of the sufficiency of the
work. These men went from
college and at once accepted
large'responsibility and took a
large part in building and de-
veloping the nation.
,When we consider the ques-
tion as to whether the same
course that was given to this
older generation, or a similar
course, or one which has been
expanded to give more tech-
of activity in railroad construction, say 1887 or nical work in the same period of time, is sufficient

directly from college to the engineering party, and the two periods before we undertake to give the

supervision of construction. The engineering of 1878. The difference is in a very large part due
schools were few and the classes were small, so that to the achievements of the engineering profession.

The development of our transportation agencies
made possible the creation of great cities, the build-
ing up of hundreds of new industries, the great ex-
pansion of our agricultural areas and the unifica-
tion of the nation. In no other country in the
world has such a job of nation building ever been
done. There is not only unity of policy and pur-
pose in the United States, and freedom from clan
and dialect, but the old provincialism of pre-civi!
war days has disappeared. The
old dialects which prevailed
have practically all given way.
The United States from one
end to the other has been made
one great nation by the great
system of railroads which has
been created. Transportation
developed industry, brought a
great population to the wilder-
ness, built states and cities, and
brought about a condition of
prosperity not to be found any-
where else.
Our job of modern city build-
ing has been made possible
through engineering devel-
opment. Water supplies, gas,
electric light and power, the
telephone, the telegraph, the
use of steel and concrete in tall buildings, elevators
and municipal transportation have made possible
city populations undreamed of fifty years ago.
The great increase in population made necessary
greatly increased production, so that engineering
skill was called upon to develop machinery to take
the place of hand labor. Greater production and
greater efficiency resulted in lower prices and
greater consumption and a gradual improvement in
the conditions of the workingmen. Many prob-
lems have been solved in the last fifty years. Many
wrongs have been righted. It has been a period
of development and of evolution. New problems
are continually coming up, problems of administra-
tion, financing, economics, accounting and engineer-
ing, which are vastly more complicated than those
of years ago because of the great size of our pres-
ent corporations and their complexity.
We are no longer satisfied with mere utilitarian-
ism. The old ugly purely serviceable structures
have had to give way to more artistic design. This
is evidenced not only in public buildings, but in in-
dustrial plants and private homes. Greater safety
has been demanded and a greater measure of com-
fort and, in these later days, luxury.
The nation of today is not only more populous
and more wealthy, but consumption per capita has
greatly increased, and the consuming classes now
include all classes.
THE place of economics in
engineering has become
more thoroughly established
as the profession has advanced
and has reached a position
where it is quite generally con-
ceded to be a necessary part of
every engineer's training. Prof.
Henry E. Riggs, of the civil
engineering department, has
made a personal study of this
situation, and is most compe-
tent to discuss it from the
standpoint of an engineer as
well as of one whose chief in-
terest lies in engineering edu-
cation. His discussion, be-
sides being fundamental, will
be found most interesting to
all readers. THE EDITOR.
One need but to compare statistics of 1875 and
1925 to see that there has been not only an increase,
but an enormous increase in manufacture, in trans-
portation, in public utility service, in practically
every form of human effort. Where the engineer
dealt with thousands of dollars years ago, he deals
today with millions or hundreds of millions of dol-
lars. He needs to know many things now, which
then were left to others.
_ These great changes in the
country have brought about a
complete change in engineering
practice. These changes have
been reflected in the engineer-
ing curricula by the addition
first of mechanical engineering,
then of electrical engineering,
then of chemical engineering
to the old course in civil engi-
neering. There has been a
further tendency to split up
further, as for example civil en-
gineering has structural, hy-
draulic, sanitary, railroad, high-
way and municipal engineering
groups, all tending to specializ-
ation, and aiming at preparing
men for technical work in the
many new fields that have de-
veloped in the last half century. The colleges have
held to the four-year course, and have steadily held
to the idea that technicians, engineers only, were
wanted.
The writer rather resents being called old, yet he
distinctly remembers the first telephone exhibit in
Machinery Hall at the Centennial in 1876, he re-
members the very early types of electric light, he
has seen a development in the railroad industry that
is almost unbelievable, and it seems only recently
that his interest was keen in the first horseless car-
riage and in Professor Langley's flying machine.
These arc mentioned merely to indicate that the
things with which the present generation is so fa-
miliar were inventions of only yesterday, and that
the dreams of today will be wonderful realities to-
morrow. The point to be emphasized is that busi-
ness, industry, manufacturing, transportation and
all other forms of human activity which need en-
gineering service are entirely different today from
what they were fifty years ago if they then existed
at all. Methods of manufacture and production have
changed. This is the era of the automobile, the
airplane, the radio. This is the day of great cen-
tralized industry. It is an era that calls for greater
and broader knowledge. It demands all kinds of
men, not alone for design and research, but for oper-
ation and management.

A STUDY OF THE STRENGTH AND LOADING OF
AERIAL LINE STRUCTURES
By ROBERT H. SHERLOCK
Associate Professor of Civil Engineering
THE use of electric power in all phases of
industrial and domestic life in the United
States has grown very rapidly in the past
decade or two, so that at the present time most
sections of the country are traversed at frequent
intervals by lines of steel or wooden structures
carrying high tension transmission wires. It is
highly important that the struc-
tures which support these
transmission wires should be
reasonably free from the haz-
ard of failure. This is especial-
ly true where the power line
crosses railways, highways, tel-
ephone lines, or any other place
where the collapse of the struc-
ture would bring the power
carrying units into contact with
objects or persons in such a
way as to cause injury. It is
also highly essential to pre-
serve the integrity of these
structures so that service may
be continued uninterruptedly,
since many lines of human ac-
tivity depend for their great-
est usefulness upon having
light and power continuously available.
The structures which are being investigated in
this experiment are the cables and the wooden
poles which carry them. These elements must sus-
tain their own weight, the weight of the ice coat-
ing which occasionally forms on them, and must
resist the force of the wind blowing either upon the
bare wires or upon the wires after the coating of
ice has been formed.
It is a comparatively simple matter to compute
the dead loads which must be sustained by these
structures. It is not so easy, however, to arrive at
a fair estimate of the probable weight of ice which
it will be necessary for them to carry. Most people
living in this climate are familiar with the phe-
nomena caused by an ice storm. Occasionally these
ice storms are so severe that they result in the for-
mation of ice coatings sufficiently heavy to break
the limbs of large trees and to pull down wires and
their supports. The question of the amount of ice
which it is fair to assume as being supported by
WHENEVER the engi-
neer's most versatile
tool, mathematics, fails him, he
must turn to experimental
means to determine his desired
ends. This may happen very
often and under many differ-
ent conditions. Prof. R. H.
Sherlock, of the Civil Engineer-
ing Department, has described
in a very interesting way how
such a problem as this is being
met in the field of power trans-
mission. His discussion brings
out well the careful and precise
manner in which all such prob-
lems are being met by the engi-
neer.
THE EDITOR.
the wires is not, however, a part of this investi-
gation. This question is being investigated jointly
by the National Electric Light Association and
the United States Weather Bureau.
In conventional designs it is usual to assume
that the wind blows against wires which are car-
rying a one-half inch radial thickness of ice, and
that the force tending to bend
each pole is equal to a wind
pressure of 8 pounds per square
foot acting on the projected
area of all the wires in one
span. In this project the wires
carry special insulation to sim-
ulate the size and weight of
one-half inch radial thickness
of ice.
No experiments have yet
been conducted in the field to
determine what is a fair as-
sumption as to the wind forces
which must be sustained by
aerial line structures. Hereto-
fore it has been common prac-
tice to assume that the wires
are attached to supports which
are immovable and to analyze
the stresses existing in the wires by the laws of
mechanics as they would apply to such a condi-
tion, having first assumed a vertical force equal
to the weight of the wires plus their ice covering
and a horizontal force equal to the wind force
described in the preceding paragraph. This makes
a problem in mechanics which involves the solu-
tion of a cable hanging freely between two rigid
supports and subjected to a uniformly distributed
transverse force. The cable thus assumes the form
of a catenary lying in an inclined plane, the sag
of the catenary from the supports depending upon
the original sag, the weight of the ice coating,
the force of the wind, and the elastic properties
of the wire. The solution is quite conventional
although rather complicated, and is usually sim
plified by assuming that the curve is a parabola
instead of a catenary. These assumptions arc

field conditions. The chief error of this method
of solution is due to the fact that the supports for
the wires are not rigid, but are elastic and sway
to and fro under the action of the wind, some-
times with extreme violence. Several influences
are thus introduced which tend to alter the results
from what they would have been if the supports
were in fact unyielding. Some of these influences
are the changing of the span length due to longi

THE DEFLECTION FOR A GIVEN LOAD.
tudinal bending of the poles, the inertia forces
which are a necessary part of the movement of
the structures, and the yielding of the ground in
which the poles are set. It is the purpose of this
investigation to evaluate these influences.
Another controversial point in connection with
the design of aerial line structures is the question
of the extent to which the wires in the exposed
front of a group of wires shield the wires behind
them. At present the various safety codes through-
out the country make no allowance for this effect
and it is hoped that this experiment will yield some
data which will tend to clarify the situation.
The investigation has been divided into two
parts, the first of which will attempt to correlate
wind velocities with pole stresses, and the second
will attempt to determine the correlation between
wind velocities and the shielding of back wires by
those in front of them.
The scheme which has been adopted for meas-
uring the stresses in the poles depends upon the
measurement of the deflection of one point on the
pole from the tangent to the elastic curve at an-
other point. This method is familiar to all stu-
dents who have taken the course here in strength
of materials where it is treated under the head-
ing of "Area Moments." In order to apply this
method, it was necessary to calibrate each pole
before it was erected in the line. The method of
doing this is shown in Figure 1. The pole is
placed in a rack and is subjected to a cross-bend-
ing force applied at the middle cross-arm near the
top of the pole. The deflection of this point from
the tangent to the elastic curve is obtained by
clamping a "tangent board'" to the pole at the
ground line and measuring the deflection of the
top of the pole from the tangent line at the base
of the pole, as this tangent line is preserved by
means of the tangent board. It will be seen that
by the method of fastening which was used no
bending is introduced into the tangent board. It
may change its position as the force is applied
but this is purely due to the bending which takes
place below the point of attachment to the pole
and in no way affects the force which is required
to deflect the top of the pole a given distance from
the tangent to the elastic curve at the point of at-
tachment. Telescopes were used because of the
increased accuracy which could be obtained. It
will be observed that a second telescope is intro-
duced to measure the twist which takes place in
the pole as it is deflected in a vertical plane. By
means of this device, it was possible to calibrate
the poles so that after they are installed in the line
the forces which are tending to bend the pole may
be measured by observing the deflection of a point
near the top of the pole from the tangent to the
elastic curve as established at the bottom of the
pole.
After the poles were erected the three points
on each pole which were used for calibration pur-
pose were attached by means of metal tapes to
instruments which are capable of transmitting to
a central chart house a record of their deflections.
This is shown in Figure 2 where the pole in the
foreground is provided with tapes at the top, at
the top of the tangent board, and at the ground
line, which tapes pass into a steel mast and down
through the steel mast into an instrument box.
Figure 3 shows the inside of one of these boxes.
It will be observed that the tapes after entering
the box are passed through a series of motion re-
ducers so that the deflections of the points on the
pole are transmitted to the three-motion transmit-
ters which are shown at the right of the box. The
motion is transmitted electrically to a receiving
set in the chart house and is then recorded on mov-
ing strip charts. In Figure 2 the anemometers
used for measuring and recording the velocities of
the wind may be seen. The one just beyond the
first pole in the picture is of the pressure tube type
which works on the principle of the Dynes tube.
Some distance along the line the revolving cup
type of anemometer may be seen. Near the fifth
pole from the extreme end of the line a second
pressure tube anemometer is installed. The rec-
ords of wind velocity and direction from the pres-

sure tube anemometers are recorded on strip charts
located in the boxes at the base of the anemometer
masts. The records from the revolving cup ane-
mometer are electrically transmitted to the chart
house where they are likewise recorded on a strip
chart. All charts are driven by synchronous motor
clocks so that it is possible at any instant to ob-
serve the velocity of the wind and the deflection in
any given pole, and from this to correlate the
stresses in the pole with the wind velocity which
caused them. At the present time there are in-
stalled at the site eighteen such electrically driven
charts, fifteen of which record deflections and three
of which record wind velocities.
The calibration of the motion transmitting in-
struments involved several interesting problems
inasmuch as they were inclined to vary in their
records according to the speed and the amplitude
of oscillation. For the purpose of this calibration
work a special device was set up in the laboratory
of the Department of Electrical Engineering to
simulate the speed and amplitude of oscillations
which would occur in the line. Figure 4 shows this
setup with a transmitter and a receiver being cali-
brated. The transmitter is in the left foreground
of the picture and may be identified by the dial and
pointer. The motion of the lever was produced by

means of a variable speed motor acting through
a countershaft and a crank disc. The variations in
the speed of oscillations were obtained by vary-
ing the speed of the motor. The variations in the
amplitude of oscillations were obtained by vary-
ing the point of attachment of the operating lever
to the crank disc. The receiver is shown at the
right of the picture with a portion of the strip
chart hanging down in front. The electric clock
mechanism is contained in the rectangular box

just to the left and back of the strip chart. Rack
of the clock may be seen the small cylindrical dash-
pot, which was used to damp down excessive move-
ment of the chart pen. The viscosity of the oil in
the dash-pots was varied to suit the characteristics
of the different instruments.
It was necessary to calibrate all anemometers
for true wind velocities within the range of the
working conditions on this project. This work
was done in the wind tunnel with the assistance
of Prof. E. A. Stalker of the Department of Aero-
nautical Engineering. All three anenometcrs
were calibrated for wind velocities up to about
ninety miles per hour.
The instruments necessary to carry on the sec-
ond part of the investigation, namely, the shield-
ing effect of the front wires on those behind them,
have not yet been obtained. Provision has been
made, however, for installing them in the wires
and in the chart house.
In Figure 2 several links about two feet long
may be seen in some of the wires just north of the
pole in the foreground. There are twenty of these
links in the line, and they are so arranged that
they may be removed and telemeters installed in
their places. The telemeters are instruments
which transmit electrically to the chart house, con-
tinuous records of the stresses in the wires. The
records are received by an oscillograph and are
recorded as an irregular curve on a photographic
film, which, like the charts for recording pole de-

SKETCHING—THE ARCHITECT'S DIVERSION
By ROY B. BLASS, '29A
IT is said that variety is the spice of life. If
we should apply this statement to the archi-
tect, we would find that his work is certainly
composed of variety. However, as a rule, his work,
when carried to its final stage, consists mainly of
drawing. Now, since most of this drawing is of
the mechanical type, that is, done with the T-square,
triangle and other para-
phernalia of ruling pens,
compasses and dividers,
the natural thing to do to
offset and balance this, is
to indulge in free-hand
drawing.
In itself, sketching con-
tains more variety than
the unknowing person
can imagine. The innum-
erable mediums and the
countless techniques of
each afford a variety that
is astounding. Not until
one begins to make a
study of sketching in one
or more of its many forms
does one realize the ex-
tent of its possibilities.
Forgetting variety for
the moment, let us discuss
the advantages of sketch-
ing. Perhaps it is best to
start with the cost. Pen-
cils, pens, pastels and
charcoal are the cheapest of drawing materials.
Outside of these, the only requirements for a com-
plete sketching outfit would be paper and erasers.
Often the cheapest of papers are used with excel-
lent results, namely, ordinary wrapping paper. It
can readily be seen that expense is no obstacle.
The second advantage might be the quickness
with which one can put his ideas into pictorial
form. A few rapid strokes, a hasty touch here and
there, and the idea is down. In fact, in most cases,
it is true that the quicker the strokes Ihc better the
drawing. However, that is taking into consider-
ation that the drawer has had enough experience to
know where to put the strokes and how they should
be made. It must be understood by the student that
such a thing as a good sketch is only arrived at by
self-improved training and continuous practice, in
a word—"perseverance,"—but perseverance carried

to the point where self-consciousness is left behind
and the sketch is produced in a manner in which
the way to do it and the technique are subconscious.
The effort, if any, is given rather to the choice and
the selection than to the way to sketch the subject
when chosen. Thus the sketch "happens" as a re-
sult of the complete command of the process which
necessarily results from
doing it often and doing it
better every time.
Quickness is not only
an advantage but it is also
a requirement. The qual-
ities common to all good
sketches may be said to be
directness, crispness and
simplicity. To obtain
these qualities one must
show no evidence of hesi-
tating touches.
Custom might \vell be
called a third advantage in
the case of pencil or pen
and ink. Everyone has
learned to handle both
since childhood. There-
fore, it should be m u c h
easier to use either of
these two mediums in
preference to any others.
The fourth reason for
the popularity of sketch-
ing and perhaps the direct
cause of its wide usage is the fascination that it
holds for the architect. The graceful flowing lines
that come from the blunted pencil or charcoal point
are indeed a relief from the needle point exactness
of the drafting room technique. Only one who has
experienced the sometimes laborious task of draw-
ing mechanically can appreciate an escape from it,
if even for only a few moments. I believe that, as
a rule, the majority of architectural students in the
university enjoy the courses offered in freehand
drawing and sketching more than any of the others
for the simple reason that they have more of a
feeling of freedom while pursuing those courses.
For an architect, the pleasure he derives should
be sufficient to warrant the time he spends on
sketching. On the other hand, taking into consid-
eration what experience he gains, it is almost indis-

ARCHITECTURE BUILDING FULFILLS DREAMS
liv WALDO M. ABBOT, '13L
This article was published in a recent issue of "The
Michigan Alumnus" and permission was granted to re-
publish it in the "Michigan Technic" for the benefit of its
readers.
The author, Mr. Waldo M. Abbot, is one of the associate
Editors of "The Michigan Alumnus" as well as assistant
professor of Rhetoric in the Literary College. We feel that
we are extremely fortunate in securing such an article and
hope that it will be appreciated by the readers of this maga-
zine.—The Editor.
FROM the tip of the golden paint brush, which
serves as the mast for the galleon of art
weather-vane at the peak of the tower, to the
rich tiles of the University of Michigan seal in-
laid in the floor of the lobby, the new Architecture
Building gives notice to all who pass or enter that
it is the shrine of the University artists.
No other University building, built with state
funds, has the artistic symmetry combined with util-
itarian arrangement that is to be found in this first
large building to be designed upon the campus.
Facing the garden of Martha Cook dormitory, the
Architecture Building is planned to be an artistic
link between the beauty of the dormitory, with its
gables, arched leaded windows, and the higher, more
formal stolidity of the present block of the Univer-
sity High School.
To unify this group the roof line of the dormi-
tory is carried up to and above the height of the
University High School through the medium of the
architecture tower; the structural material of the
three buildings is the same; the slate of the archi-
tect's peaked roof harmonizes at the west with
that of the dormitory, yet at the cast the roof is
stopped by the tower from being out of keeping
with the flat top of the School of Education's unit;
while the arched studio windows, with their Nile-
green grills, form an easy transition from the Gothic
beauty of the girl's dormitory to the factory-like
efficiency of the school's steel windows.
The view from South University avenue across
the landscaped garden of the dormitory to the ter-
raced floors, rising to the fifteen-foot arched and
leaded studio windows and thence carried up to the
golden galleon with mast a paint brush, sail a pal-
let, and see a T-square, cmphasizes the desirability
and practicability of making the university educa-
tional units beautiful as well as serviceable.
Unfortunately the exterior is artistically unfin-
ished, for the legislative appropriation of $40.'),()00
was inadequate to provide for the carving of the
medallions and for the statue of the Goddess of
Art which is to stand above the main entrance.

been purchased at $90 apiece, hut the artists sought
the beauty of a master sculptor rather than ma
chine-made representations.
After walking the length of the Martha Cook gar-
den upon Haven avenue one enters a brick lined
vestibule where ample opportunity is given the stu-
dent to clean his shoes before he steps upon the
tiled floor of the lobby. The formality of the wide
limestone staircase and the strength of the stone
columns give a monumental note to this entrance
hall which forms the base of the tower. The floor
is of brown tiles in which the University seal is in-
laid in rich colors, a gift of the late Albert Cham-

INDUSTRIES OF MICHIGAN—VII
BRASS AND COPPER ROLLING MILLS
By DONAL HAMILTON HAINES
IN any industrial census taken thirty years ago,
Michigan would have had no rank whatsoever
in the brass and copper industry: statistics
gathered at the present time would show the state
high up in the list and the chief rival in the produc-
tion of brass and copper of those eastern centers
which formed the cra-
dle of the industry and
are still its chief strong-
hold.
The growth which
has taken place during
that period marks not
so much the natural
spread of an industry
into new territory as a
sudden and very rapid
development which is
really an offshoot of
even greater expansion
and increase in other
fields. It is not safe to
say that, had the auto-
motive industry become
concentrated in New
York, Pennsylvania or
one of the New England states, Michigan would
never have come to any prominence in the produc-
tion of brass and copper, but certainly her place in
the list would have been far lower than it is.
To get a proper view of the industry it is nec-
essary to go far back of the beginnings of its
Michigan branch, which did not come into exis-
tence until many of the eastern concerns were old,
established houses and American brass and copper
manufacture had become something more than a
small-scale imitation of its European parent.
The true beginnings lie far back at some remote
and only roughly guessed time, when primitive man
found in his fire-pit pellets of some metal which
could be melted together into still larger masses
and then hammered into something like the desired
shape with the crude stone implements which were
his only tools. This discovery of bronze, the first
useful metal which man was able to turn to his
ever-increasing needs, marks the first really sig-
nificant advance of the human race.
These first chance-found bits of copper alloy were
of course due to the accidental use in the fire-pit
of stones or clay containing copper and either tin or

RECTLY TO THE ROLLS.
zinc, and the discovery was peculiarly fortunate in
that the metal on which the man first happened was
the one most widely distributed in usable condition.
There can be little doubt that the skin-clad discover-
er may very well have found iron pellets in the ashes
of his fire before and far more often than he did those
of bronze, but the for-
mer would have been of
no use to him—save as
missiles for his sling or
some such crude pur-
pose—being quite un-
workable with such
methods as he then pos-
sessed.
To what extent the
ancients actually pro-
gressed in their use of
different copper alloys
is not definitely known,
but there seems a prob-
ability that the degree
of their success in hard-
ening pure copper
through its fusion with
either tin or zinc may
account for the so-called "lost art" of tempering
copper. And since zinc is not found pure in nature
while very considerable deposits of copper and tin
were known to the ancients, it was only natural
that bronze should have been a commonplace metal
for a considerable period before brass was discov-
ered.
Exact dates cannot be given, but it seems clear
that in those shadowy eras before recorded history,
bronze was in common use in Babylon, Nineveh,
Egypt, China, Japan, and India, both for swords,
spears, and implements of war and household uten-
sils of various kinds. Articles of this kind which have
been found during recent excavations indicate that
the earliest bronzes had no fixed metal content, the
percentage of tin ranging from three to eighteen
per cent. Objects found in Egyptian tombs, and
believed to have been fashioned before 2000 B. C,
made both from pure copper and from bronze con-
taining from ten to fourteen per cent of tin, indi-
cate that in Egypt at least the manufacture of
bronze had become fairly well standarized even at
that early period.
Just when brass first appeared is not definitely

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
known. One of the earliest examples which has
been discovered is a Roman coin bearing the date
of 20 B. C., containing 17.31r/t of zinc. From this
time brass enjoyed an increasingly wide use. but
was still far less common than bronze. As late as
the early years of the Christian era, bronze was
still being used for all the heavier work. Some-
where around 900 A. D. the art of casting bronze
and other alloys of copper was lost, and there was
no progress in the art for some three centuries.
Some very interesting side-paths might be fol-
lowed in this discussion of the ancient art, but they
must be confined to a single comment on a distinc-
tive difference between the ancient and modern proc-
esses of handling copper alloys. Both among the
ancients and the workmen of medieval times, bronze
and other alloys were always cast in approximately
the desired form and then hammered or worked
down: the modern practice of casting ingots which
are rolled into sheets or drawn into tubes, rods
and wire was wholly unknown.
Anyone wishing to familiarize himself with the
story of the industry in America must study the
chronicles of Connecticut, and particularly that
quarter of it known as the Naugatuck Valley, for
the manufacture of brass articles really began in
this section of the country; a bit of Yankee shrewd-
ness in combating the difficult economical situation
of the early davs in New England. Its pioneers
were engaged only in making a living by the most
promising means at their command, wholly uncon-

scions that they were laying the foundations of a
great industry.
Connecticut was hard hit by the westward move-
ment of the population which took place in the last
years of the eighteenth century. It had been an
agricultural community, but the greater opportunity
for the tiller of the soil lay in the more fertile
lands being opened up in the west, and for those
who remained behind during this shifting away
from the Atlantic seaboard there lay only a choice
between rock-ribbed farms which could not com-
pete with the more fertile regions beyond and
some trade or manufacture. Out of such a neces-
sity grew one of the "backbone" industries of the
country.
Brass and copper were not, however, the articles
to which New England turned first when hard ne-
cessity, plus such natural advantages as water power
and convenient ports, drove them from agriculture
to manufacture: both the iron and textile industries
were beyond the "infant" stage before the other
found root, although there were some slight traces
of it at a much earlier date.
Even in pre-Revolutionary days there had been
some attempts at brass casting in New England,
the first recorded being made by John Winthrop in
his iron foundry at Lynn, Mass., in 1644. There
and at Philadelphia•some brass cannon were cast
before the American Revolution. Similar work was
carried on elsewhere for the next fifty or seventy-
five years, but in all these undertakings the metal
was cast and then finished by hand as it had been
centuries earlier.
The first use of rolled brass (and apparently the
first making of brass on the American continent ac-
cording to a well established formula) had its hum-
ble origin in the button industry. This had for years
been a household industry throughout the colonies,
most of the buttons being of pewter. In 1808 two
brothers, Abel and Levi Porter, came to Waterbury,
Mass., from Southingtop, .Conn., and set up in the
former place, a small plant for the manufacture of
buttons from sheet brass.
Hand-to-mouth methods ruled in the Porters' tinv
plant. The importation of copper was a future de-
velopment, and they obtained their supply of the
metal by combing the country and buying up old
stills, kettles, sheathing from ships and similar ar-
ticles. They did their own fusing, but the brass in-
gots were taken to an iron mill and the sheet brass
obtained by running the ingots between two-inch
steel rollers driven by horse power. Various im-
provements were made in the process of manufac-
ture, and successful resistance to foreign competi-
tion—gained only after a precarious struggle like
that through which most of the young enterprises
of America were compelled to pass—brought the
business to a firm footing. And for the next quarter
of a century, only brass rolling done on this side of
the Atlantic was for the making of buttons.
By 1835 the industry had passed safely through
the experimental stage, and, while the button was
still the manufactured article for which most of
the rolling was done, superior manufacturing con-
ditions in England had forced American manufac-
turers to make a practice of establishing and oper-
ating their own rolling mills, so that when the
period of expansion finally came, the first spade

work had already been done.
To follow the history of the industry from this
point to the present day is to get off the straight
path and into the attractive mazes offered by the
development of any large American manufacturing
enterprise. For a number of years the Naugatuck
Valley and other neighboring sections remained the
chief brass and copper rolling centers, but the steady
trend of westward growth exerted its inevitable
effect so that today the immediate vicinity of De-
troit is the greatest brass-producing section of the
country outside of the famous valley, and Detroit
is second only to Waterbury, Conn., among the
cities of the country in annual tonnage of brass.
The first of the Michigan concerns was the De-
troit Copper and Brass Rolling Mills, incorporated
in 1880 and re-incorporated in 191()—and not only
was it the first of the Michigan plants but the first
venture in the brass industry west of Rome, N. Y.
A few years later, in the early part of 1906, the
Michigan Copper and Brass Company was incor-
porated, and turned out its first product in July of
the following year. The experiment was doubtfully
regarded by the industry in general, for Michigan,
at that period, was pretty far west in a manufac-
turing sense, was widely separated from the larger

WIRES.
concerns in its field and—most serious of all—was
at a considerable distance from the natural con-
sumers of brass and copper, most of which had
established themselves within easy shipping dis-
tance of the New England producers.
The founders of the business, however, were men
who had faith in the industrial future of the middle
west and who believed that they were setting up
the new plant in a region to which, had they found-
ed it farther east, they might have been compelled
to move it within a few years' time. The results
proved that they were men of broad vision and far-
sighted business acumen. From the outset they
built with a view not to experiment but enduring
success. They secured a tract of fourteen acres in
the heart of the (old) Detroit manufacturing dis-
trict, close to the Detroit River on one side and
the Michigan Central railroad on the other. The
first mills, while small, were the best and most com-
plete which could be built by experienced men from
the east. Thus, when the amazing development of
the automotive industry made history throughout
the middle west and particularly in the Detroit dis-
trict, these two pioneer firms were in a position to
grow with the newer industry, and at the same time
to assist its almost meteoric development.
A few figures on the Michigan Copper and Brass
Company will serve to show the rate at which the
business has grown in the state. The original in-
vestment in the plant was about $400,000, while its
present value is in excess of $6,000,000. From a
single small mill, the plant has expanded until it
has a floor area of over 300,000 square feet. Its
output has increased from approximately 6,000.000
pounds a year to a figure well over ten times that
amount.
The development of special machinery in the in-
dustry is comparatively recent. As already stated,
the first brass rolled in this country was so treated
in an iron mill, and the first brass rolls were simply
better made, had a smoother finish and were given
a higher degree of technical care than those which
had been used in the iron mills. But there was noth-
ing peculiar about them nor about any of the other
machinery to be found in the ordinary brass mill.
The real change did not come until after 1900.
Seamless brass and copper tubing and the ma-
chinery necessary for its manufacture formed the
first great step forward. The so-called English
method of making seamless tubing was invented as
early as 1838—the process being to cast a cylindei
of brass and then draw the casting down over steel
arbors. For twenty years this process was the only
one used in this country. The Mannesman process
was first developed in Germany, and introduced
into this country about 1894. In this process a
solid bar of metal is thrown against mandrils so
related that the bar issues pierced from the ma-
chine. This hollow tube may then be drawn to any
required specifications in the older style tube-draw-
ing machines. A third process, still more recently
devised, makes tubing by the cupping method, in
which a blank disc of metal is first cupped by a die
and then drawn according to specifications.
Perhaps the most noteworthy of modern develop-
ments (and certainly the most impressive in actual
operation to the layman observer) is that of "ex-
trusion." In this process a hot billet of metal is
subjected to immense pressure from a hydraulic
press and forced through a steel die, the metal issu-
ing in "rod" form. The extrusion machines in the
rod mill of the Michigan Copper and Brass Co. are

A MACHINE THAT RULES FOURTEEN THOUSAND
LINES PER INCH
By KRNEST F. BARKER
Associate Professor of Physics
DISTANCES of less than one ten-thousandth
of an inch reproduced over ;iml over again
with a permissible error of less than one mil-
lionth of an inch; an order such as this would baf-
fle most instrument makers, even in shops where
high precision is the rule. Add to this the neces-
sity of marking off such
distances by parallel
grooves of a certain se-
lected shape and depth,
and the difficulties are
further multiplied. This
was the problem faced
by the Physics Depart-
ment several years ago
when plans were initi-
ated for the construc-
tion of a machine to
rule optical gratings.
After many months of
development the ma-
chine is now function-
ing successfully in the
third basement of the
Physics Building, and
turning out ruled plates
which make possible
the spectrum analysis of long wave infra-red radia-
tion, a type of research more highly developed by
Professor Randall and his associates than in am
other laboratory in the world.
There are several other ruling machines in exis-
tence, but nowhere else is there one so large as this,
and nowhere are gratings of the same sort being
produced. Its capacity is a plate ten by twenty
inches, upon which lines may be ruled with a spe-
cially prepared diamond point as close at 14,400 per
inch. These lines are V-shaped grooves of uniform
depth drawn upon a polished optically flat metal
surface. To complete such a grating wrould require
about three weeks of continuous operation, during
which time the diamond would travel along the
metal surface a total of 260.000 feet, or about 50
miles. Very often smaller grating can be used, a
stock size being five by seven inches, and the spac-
ing is commonly much coarser, for instance 3600 or
even 1200 lines per inch. Temperature regulation

within a fraction of a degree is, of course, necessary,
to prevent variations of spacing due to thermal ef-
fects. This is one reason for operating in a room
so far underground.
In principle the machine is very simple, resem-
bling somewhat an ordinary shaper. There are two
carriages traveling at
right angles to one an-
other upon plane ways
forming a cross. The
upper carriage moves
back and forth about
ten times per minute
along the shorter trans-
verse rails. It carries
the diamond point
mounted upon a coun-
ter - b a lanced lever
swinging on pivots be-
tween sapphire bear-
ings. During the draw
stroke this point floats
very lightly along the
metal surface, pressing
a groove as a sled run-
ner would do. Near
the end of the stroke
it is raised so as to clear the surface and returned
to the starting position, where a mechanical trip-
ping mechanism lowers it again. The cam operat-
ing this carriage is so designed that the linear speed
of the tool is almost uniform during the time it is
ruling.
The lower carriage mounted on the longer rails
bears the plate which is to be ruled, and travels for-
ward by minute steps. It is actuated from below
by a nut which engages the large screw running
between the rails and parallel to them. At one end
of this screw is a ten-inch ratchet wheel with 720
teeth accurately spaced along its circumference.
Mounted in front of the wheel is a rocker arm with
a small clutch operated magnetically, which pushes
the wheel forward at exactly the right moment
through a distance of one or more teeth as may be
required. This occurs while the ruling point is
lifted. Since the pitch of the screw is one-twentieth
of an inch it is easy to compute the steps by which
the plate progresses.

The details of design and construction of this
mechanism were in the hands of Capt. A. deKhotin-
sky, who came to Michigan particularly to under-
take this task. He is himself an expert instrument
maker, and was particularly well qualified because
of an earlier association with Professor Michelson
at Chicago, while the ruling machine there was in
the experimental stages. Patterns and castings
from deKhotinsky's specifications were the work of
the engineering shops and foundry. Finishing as-
sembling and testing were done by the instrument
shop of the Physics Department. The large cast-
ing forming the body of the instrument, after thor-
ough heat treatment, was machined and placed in
permanent position upon a concrete pier. Rails, car-
riages and bearings were then scraped in by hand,
an operation involving many weeks of labor.
As far as accuracy is concerned, the most critical
parts are, of course, the screw with its bearings, and
the nut. The screw is two inches in diameter and
thirty inches long between bearings. After having
been cut upon a very fine engine lathe it was sub-
jected to a tedious process of grinding to remove
all traces of periodic error, and to bring it to a per-
fectly uniform diameter. For this purpose a nut
about twelve inches long was prepared, cut in two
lengthwise, and put together with removable
clamps. The screw having been swung between
centers, this nut was run back and forth along it
for several weeks, using progressively finer grinding
compounds, and ending with fine rouge. Every few
hours the nut was changed by reversing first one
half and then the other, the clamps always being
drawn up enough to insure a snug fit. In this way
all peculiarities of the thread itself were gradually
eliminated. From time to time the grinding nut
was replaced by the brass nut of the machine it-
self, which is also in two parts, and thus nut and
screw were ground together. Observations of the
force necessary to turn the screw with the nut held
in various positions gave information as to uniform-
ity. This is particularly important since even slight
variations in strain must be avoided.
The thrust of the screw as it pushes the carriage
forward each step is borne by the butt bearing at
the end opposite to the ratchet wheel. Precision in
this bearing is no less important than in the screw
thread itself, for a periodic error is introduced if the
screw moves longitudinally in the slightest degree
as it rotates. A sapphire plate ground and polished
to an optically flat surface and mounted in a frame
with adjusting screws is placed at the end of the
screw upon a heavy rib in the casting. Before the
screw was mounted this plate was adjusted by re-
flecting in it the cross-hairs of a telescope so that
its surface is exactly perpendicular to the axis.
Against this is placed a high grade steel ball bear-
ing which fits into a conical hole in the end of the
screw. This hole has been accurately centered by
grinding with the screw in place on the machine and
observation shows that the point of contact of the
ball upon the sapphire surface is actually stationary
as the screw rotates.
Tests of the butt bearing and of the screw thread
have been made by interference of light waves.
These show that both the periodic errors and the
error of run have been reduced to negligible
amounts. Optical tests of the gratings themselves
show that some slight errors still appear, however.
They are probably due to variations in thickness of
the oil film between screw and nut, and the prob-
lem of proper lubrication is still under considera-
tion.
One other feature of the machine required an in-
teresting experimental development, viz.: the prepa-
ration of diamond ruling points. Heretofore it has
always been the custom to employ fragments of
diamond which, due to the crushing, have formed
an edge where the cleavage faces intersect. Not
only is it very difficult to find a properly shaped
fragment of this sort, but also the planes bounding
the cutting edge are rarely large enough and smooth
enough for ruling deep grooves. The technique of
grinding and polishing diamond tools has been de-
veloped in our shop until it is now possible to pro-
duce them with edges so fine that no irregularities
appear even with reflected light under a high power
microscope. Commercial diamond tools always ex-
hibit rough edges, while the stones prepared as

gems have all corners rounded slightly. The fin-
ished tools are shaped like a common barn, inverted
so that the ridge pole sets as cutting edge. The
two ends, and the two sides of the roof are highly
polished planes. When placed in position at just
the proper angle they press without cutting, form-
ing very smooth grooves with brilliantly reflecting
sides.
Although the production of gratings has already
begun on a small scale, this machine can hardly be

THE THREE MOMENT THEOREM FOR
DETERMINING BEAM REACTIONS
By RICHARD T. LIDDICOAT
Assistant Professor of Engineering Mechanics
IN reinforced concrete structures, beams continu-
ous over three or more supports are very com-
mon. To find reactions and bending moments
at the supports the methods of "Area Moments"
can be used, but to go back to fundamentals in
each case would necessitate considerable lost mo-
tion. The Three Moment Theorem derived from
either "Area Moments" or from integrating the fun-
damental differential equations is found to be a
gre.it time and patience saver
in problems of this type. An
Area Moment form of the
Three Moment Theorem for
any condition of loading which
seems simpler than the usual
form and worthy of consider-
ation follows:
Simplified Bending Moment
Diagram
If a beam has restrained end
or ends in a given span and the
amount of restraint is not
known, the bending moment at
any section will be influenced
by this restraint and so the
bending moment diagram can-
not be completely drawn until
the restraining moments are
computed. In the "Area Mo-
ment" scheme that is incon-
venient and to facilitate mat-
ters the bending moment dia-
gram is drawn for each span as though the beam
were simply supported at the ends. The unknown
moments at the ends are then assumed and plot-
ted as ordinates, a straight line between the ends
of these ordinates then completes the bending
moment diagram. The true bending moment at
anv section is the algebraic sum of the ordinates
to the two diagrams drawn as explained above.
Having computed the restraining moments at the
ends, the combination of the two diagrams men-
tioned can be made graphically as will be shown
later.
Let us consider a span such as AB, Figure 1.
Suppose it is desired to obtain the bending moment
at Section 1. It is obvious that the elastic curve
of the beam will be restrained at A and B. The
moment caused will usually be such as to cause
tension in the top fibres of the beam at these points.
A METHOD of treatment
for statically indetermi-
nent structures is familiar to
all engineers and architects,
but when attempt is made to
apply it to a system at all com-
plicated it becomes seriously
clumsy and inadequate. A
much simpler and quicker
means of making these calcu-
lations in such cases is here
outlined by Prof. Liddicoat, of
the engineering mechanics de-
partment. The simplicity to
which this treatment resolves
the solution of such problems
and its most convenient appli-
cation to reinforced concrete
and welded steel structures
make it extremely valuable to
the architect and engineer.
THE EDITOR.
There will, of course, in general be shear on each
side of the supports.
The free body diagram of span AB is shown in
Figure 2. The bending moment in this beam at
any section, such as Section 1, may be obtained
from the following equation:
M = V x — M— 2\vx Equation 1.
Where Mxis the bending moment at Section 1
VA is the shear just to right of support A.
M is the restraining mo-
ment at A, assumed as shown.
2YVX is the moment of all
the loads on the free body to
the left of Section 1. The sim-
plified bending moment dia-
gram suggested above is shown
in figure 3.
The bending moment at Sec-
tion 1 from the diagram in Fig-
ure 3 is seen to be a — b. I
propose to prove that this value
is the same as Mxin equation
1 which proof appears neces-
sary before the use of this type
of diagram.
Ordinate "a" in Figure 3 is
the value the bending moment
at Section 1 would have, if the
beam were simply supported.
Its value then will be
SWBK x — 2WX where
2WB K is the moment of the loads on the free body
of Figure 2 around B, 2W K is the left end reac-
1
tion under this assumed condition and 2WX is the
moment of the loads to the left of Section 1 about
Section 1.

Thus we have proven that the bending moment dia-
gram given in Figure 3 is correct.
Derivation of Three Moment Theorem for
General Loading
Referring to Figure 1 for any two spans the bend-
ing moment diagrams may be drawn as in Figure 4.
FIGURE 2.
Figure 4 is much the same as Figure 3 with a
similar diagram added for second span. M t is the
bending moment in the continuous beam over the
left support of the three consecutive supports con-
sidered, M is the bending moment over the mid-
dle support, and MR the right.
In order to obtain the equations for the three
moment theorem with the usual signs it is neces-
sary that these three moments, MT , MM and MR
be assumed positive, or as that causing tension in
the bottom fibres. Obviously this is not true, how-
ever, the following proof will be no less general
because of this and the resulting equation will give
results easier to interpret. In Figure 4 these mo-
ments were drawn below the /ero axis only for
convenience.
FIGURE 3.
AI is the area included between the bending mo-
ment curve for simply supported condition in left
span and the zero axis.
A2 is the area included between the bending mo-
ment curve for simply supported condition in right
span and the zero axis.
Xt is the distance from the centroid of A, to
left support.
X2 is the distance'from the centroid of A2 to
right support.
FIGURE 4.
The continuous beam takes some such form as
that shown in Figure 5 when loaded.
Curve "de" in Figure 5 is the assumed elastic
curve; line "fg" in Figure 5 is a tangent drawn to
the elastic curve at the middle support; line "hk"
is the axis of the beam before loading.
The usual assumption in computing moments and
reactions in continuous beams is that the beam does
not sag at the supports. Based on this assumption

support. By the rules of "Area Moments" the de-
flection A from tangent "fg" to the elastic curve
at the left support is found by taking the moment
of the area of the bending moment diagram between
the point whose deflection is sought and the point
of tangency, about the point whose deflection is
sought, divided by El. In this case
(See Figure 4.) As the elastic curve is assumed, the
predominating moment in the left span is seen to be
that causing tension in the bottom fibres causing
the elastic curve to be thrown above the tangent.
P! is the predominating moment in this span viewed
from mid-support.
In the right span moment causing tension in the
top fibres is seen to predominate because the elastic
curve swings downward away from the tangent "fg."

In the above figure the quantity A,X,, as has

This area is represented by the sum of a, and a2.
Area az is represented by a.,, a4, and a.-,.
Instead of finding the centroid of the whole area
and thus obtaining the moment, it is found more
convenient to take the moment of the area of each

INDUSTRIAL LEADERSHIP
(Continued from page 6)
All of this discussion may seem to be far from
having any connection with engineering education,
yet in any consideration of education we must deal
with the world of today.
The field of research in applied science has been
so greatly extended, and knowledge has been so
greatly increased, that it is obvious that the uni-
versities must prepare the men who seek to go into
industrial research much morte thoroughly than
can be done in a four-year course. The same thing
is true of design in all fields. If the four-year course
is to be kept at all, it would seem to be the fact
that it ought to merely be preparatory" for ad-
vanced work in technical fields.
It is granted that the engineering college must
train the engineers of the future. Men skilled in all
of the numerous technical fields, men competent to
design as never before, and men fitted for and
trained in research we must have, and the engineer-
ing schools must train them. There can be no ar-
gument on that score. The questions to be an-
swered are: Do our present curricula suffice? Can
this work be done in four years? Have the engi-
neering schools any other function than the train-
ing of research workers and technicians?
The writer believes that it is impossible, in any
four-year course, to train men who can be com-
petent to take their place in the world as it is now
organized and hope for any great success along
highly specialized technical lines,
The four-year course if it is to be maintained,
should be so designed as to qualify the graduate,
not as a technician and research man, but as a man
fit to enter any one of many possible fields of busi-
ness which is closely allied to engineering. Manu-
facturing, sales, building construction, highway
construction, the operation and management of pub-
lic utilities, city engineering, sanitation, and man-
agement, railroad maintenance, and operation are
among the fields which seek university graduates
with engineering training.
Much of the work does not involve technical en-
gineering, and many graduates who do get into
engineering departments remain there but a short
time as part of their training in the business. The
business problems which are met are of such a na-
ture that the courses in business administration are
of as much value as those in engineering, 3'et the


Page 23

business itself is a creation of engineering skill, and
should draw the large part of its staff from grad-
uates who have had engineering training. This con-
dition supports the conclusion that any so-called
four-year engineering course ought to be designed
with the view of giving the engineering background
to those who propose to go on in the field of busi-
ness administration, or a suitable background of
economics, accounting and business to those whose
interest is in the professional field.
If one study the records of alumni of this or any
other institution one will find that the large ma-
jority of engineering graduates enter some field
that may be very closely allied to engineering, but
that they do little or no strictly engineering work
except in the first year or so after graduation.
Certainly not over twenty-five per cent to thirty
per cent of engineering graduates become profes-
sional engineers or hold research or engineering
positions with corporations.
It would therefore appear that the engineering
schools must serve industry, not only by giving to
industry its engineers, designers and research work-
ers, but also its builders, superintendents, operating
officials and administrators.
There are two distinct groups among the engi-
neering alumni. One, the business group, is the
largest of the two. The other, the purely technical
group, the engineers, need more thorough training
in specialized fields of pure science and engineer-
ing than the first group, and they also need some
things that were not considered necessary a few
decades ago, because of the much more complicated
business world which they are to enter and for
which they are to become the designers.
Today there are many hundreds of boys enter-
ing the engineering colleges. Comparatively few
of these know just what they w-ant to do. None
of them know what door opportunity is going to
open. Some of these boys are misfits who have
no special liking for science or engineering. Prob-
ably a majority of them have good ability, suffi-
cient to insure success in a congenial field, but
whose tastes, personality, habits of thought, or
methods of work are such as to give them a much
greater success in some occupation that is not
highly technical, than in strictly engineering work.
It is from these that we must find the manufactur-
ers, sales managers, operating officials, and con-
struction men of the future. Another group, and a
good sized group, may be expected to expand and
develop during the early years of the college course,
and to find some subject that appeals to them as a
life work in which happiness may be found. Such
men should need but little inducement to go on to
a further course of training, and to more intensive
study of the specialized field of their choice.
The engineer of the future cannot secure adequate
training in a four-year college course. The engi-
neering colleges must, it would seem, make a choice
as to whether they will,
1. Continue the present four-year course, but
materially change the content of it by reducing
the technical and engineering work, cutting out
all engineering specialization and doing away with
all elective or optional work in the early years.
Such a course should prepare for business which
calls for an engineering training as a background,
and should lay a broad foundation for the engi-
neering professional course which is to follow.
Every inducement should be offered to the best
students to go on either in engineering or business
administration. Such a course ought to be one of
the main sources of supply for the school of busi-
ness administration, as well as for the school of
engineering which must logically be established.
The work of the school of engineering should con-
sist of one or preferably two years of thorough and
intensive professional engineering work, open to
students of proven ability, and to those graduates
who have found themselves after a few years of
actual experience in some field of work. This w'ork
should lead to some form of engineering degree.
2. Adopt a five or six-year engineering course,
or establish a three or four-year professional course
which presupposes two years of university college
work in which science (mathematics, physics and
chemistry) predominate.
The writer thinks that some such evolution in
engineering education must come in the very near
future.
The trouble with the engineer in the past has
been that he was inclined to be just an engineer,
and to leave all questions of finance, law, econom-
ics, accounting and management policy to others.
In college he has sought the purely utilitarian things
and has been unwilling to "waste his time" on even
English.
This progressive, busy twentieth century world
needs trained leadership in business. There is
plenty of room for the student, the research worker,
the inventor and the designer. The world needs
many a Steinmetz, who can turn his back on money
and fathom the great problems of science, but it
also needs hundreds of men of engineering train-
ing and experience who have the ability to under-
stand the great problems of finance, of valuation,
of rate making, of accounting and of economics with
which we are now dealing. Railroads are earn-
ing sixteen to seventeen million dollars a day. The
telephone is earning three or four million dollars a
day. Several industries have reached gross earn-
ings of over a million dollars a year. A number
of our great properties have investments running
into thousands of millions of dollars. Securities

tent of hundreds of millions of dollars a year on
properties of an engineering character. The suc-
cess or failure of a great property depends on the
ability of the management to understand the legal
and financial problems as well as to analyze the
costs of production and to develop every economv.
Labor is involved in every undertaking and it be-
hooves every manager and every official to under-
stand the aims and hopes and needs of labor.
When one studies these present day problems of
industry, and grasps their magnitude one realizes
that the engineer in the operating department who
does not have some grasp of them must spend his
days as a mere hewer of wood and drawer of
water. Engineering colleges tend to leave all these
economic subjects to others. Until greater empha-
sis is placed on these important subjects the en-
gineering course will never be complete.
The engineer of the future needs to have some
tools furnished to him in college which are not
now available to him. Some of the things upon
which he devotes much time and effort may be
open to question. Possibly some work is no longer
needed. Possibly too much time is given to other
work. The one thing that appears certain to the
writer is that no three-year or four-year engineer-
ing course can possibly suffice to equip engineer:
for that quality of leadership which ought to be ex-
pected of the profession.
The engineer of the future must be broadly
trained if he is to go into the field of business.
lie must be thoroughly trained in pure and ap-
plied science if he is to go into the professional
field. If he is to have success in the fullest de-
gree he must have that broadness of training and
interest that will permit him to accept any chal-
lenge of opportunity and to accept responsibility
and by his own efforts and his own study master
every problem that comes to him.

flections, is driven bv an electric clock at a speed
of three inches per minute.
The telemeter is a modification of a device which
was developed at the U. S. Bureau of Standards.
A flexible cable is interposed in the wire whose
tensile force is to be measured. This cable passes
over three saddles, the middle one of which is off-
set from the straight line joining the other two.
This causes a transverse force to be applied to the
middle saddle, which in turn transmits the force
to two opposed stacks of carbon discs, increasing
the force with which the discs of one stack are
pressed together, and decreasing the force on the
other stack. This changes the resistance which is
offered to the current passing through the stacks,
and unbalances the voltage in the two lines. The
amount of unbalance is recorded by the oscillo-
graph, which has been calibrated according to the
force required to produce various changes of volt-
age.
It will be necessary to have warning of approach-
ing storms, in order that a crew of recorders may
be at the site to supervise the instruments while
observations are being taken. This warning will
be obtained from a study of the isobars on the
daily weather maps, from the daily radio weather
reports, and from information which is telegraphed

by the Chicago weather station under certain con-
ditions. It is hoped that storm observations may
be made during March and April.
The experimental pole line is located about four
and one-half miles southwest of the campus on a
ridge running north ten degrees east, and at an
altitude of 1080 feet above sea level. It is the
highest point in the county and is about 240 feet
higher than the campus. The alignment and ex-
posure arc ideal, since an investigation of the data
at the university observatory by Professor I. IX
Scott shows that during the last five years 95 per
cent of all winds had a westerly component. Of
this 95 per cent. 65 per cent had a northerly com-
ponent and 35 per cent had a southerly component.
The pole line and the wires were erected dur-
ing September. Since that time there have been
three severe wind storms. The first two storms
blew the poles badly out of line due to the fact
that the earth back-filing around the poles had not

had time to become thoroughly consolidated. After
the poles had been re-aligned, the second time,
they were provided with the braces which are
shown in Figure 2. These braces bear against
short timbers which are buried in the ground.
They will be removed while observations are be-
ing made.
A number of faculty members have been called
upon for assistance on various special phases of
the project, and about fifty students have worked
on the job at different times. The work at the site
has been carried foward during the winter months,
frequently in the face of inclement and adverse
weather conditions, in the hope that the equipment
would be ready to take observations before the
winter storms had all passed. Professor K. S.
Swinton, of the Department of Engineering Me-
chanics, has had charge of all construction work
in the field, including the calibration of the poles.
Mr. M. B. Stout, of the Department of Electrical
Engineering, has had charge of the calibration and
installation of all electrical equipment and its ac-
cessory devices.
The work is being financed by the National Elec-
tric Eight Association, through the Department of
Engineering Research of the University of Michi-
gan. A committee of the association is co-operat-
ing actively in the study through Mr. Harold Cole,
distribution engineer of the Detroit Edison Com-
pany.

(Continued from page 18)
said to have passed the experimental stage. Minor
changes are continually being made, and no time
or expense is spared in the effort to make it me-
chanically as perfect as is humanly possible.
The experimental gratings which have already
been made are adapted to the measurement of spec-
tra ranging from the region of visible light to the
very long infra-red "heat rays" of wave length
about 0.3 mm. Each grating is designed for a se-
lected narrow range of wave lengths in such a way
as to produce the maximum usable dispersion. If
the spectrum is spread out too widely it is obvious
that the energy arriving at the receiving mechanism
of the spectrometer will be too weak to detect; if
more energy than the bare minimum is observed.
then the spread or "resolution" is smaller than
might be used. The diagram shows a cross-section
of a finished plate cut perpendicular to the ruling,
the V grooves producing a saw tooth appearance.
If a beam of light falls upon it at an angle so that
the rays are nearly perpendicular to one of the
groove surfaces it will be reflected more strongly
than will any other incident beam. The various re-
flected rays, however, differ in phase due to the fact
that they travel different distances to and from the
successive steps, and after being focused they inter-
fere. For a certain wave length only will the rays
reflected in a particular direction arrive in phase at
the receiving slit. Other wave lengths are percep-
tible at slightly different angles, but the region of
most effective reflection includes only a few degrees.
This reflection of the light as from the steps of a
stairway explains the name "echelette" gratings
which has become common. Both the spacing and
the inclination of the grooves must be adjusted for
any selected spectral region. For the longest wave
lengths the reflecting surfaces must be inclined very
little to the horizontal, because the amount of such
energy available from any source is exceedingly
minute, and it cannot be spread very widely. Angles
as small as three degrees have been used with lines
spaced one millimeter apart.
The significance of spectrum analysis in extend-
ing knowledge cannot be overestimated. Radiation
in wave lengths less than one milimeter (including
ultraviolet and X-rays) constitutes the system of
signals sent to us and the rest of the universe from
individual atoms and molecules which happen to be
broadcasting. Our success in the analysis measures
our ability to read and interpret the signals, and to
learn about the sending systems such details as
the number and relative positions of their constitu-
ent parts, the character of their motions, and the
effects of disturbance by any one of a variety of
excitation methods. Tnfra-red spectra are peculiar-
ly adapted to the study of the configurations and
motions of molecules, and have already yielded
most precise information for many of the simpler
systems like HC1, NH.,, CH4 C2H.,, CO2, etc. Only
in this way can such minute quantities as the mo-
ment of inertia of IIC1, 2.6xlCH°, or the distance
between hydrogen atoms in NH.,, 2.8xlCH cm., be
determined.
SKETCHING

pensable. The only way an artist is able to draw
as well as he does is because he draws continually.
Therefore, in this case, sketching as a hobby proves
to be not only a pleasurable, but also a profitable
pastime as it is sure to improve one's ability in :i
professional way as well as in an artistic sense.
In speaking of the pencil as a medium, Mr. How-
ard Greenly, in his preface to Mr. Arthur L. Gup-
till's book, "Sketching and Rendering in Pencil,"
says that it is a kind of staff upon which the artist
or draftsman leans most heavily. These few words
express the true value of the pencil in a clear way
for in what other medium can an artist put down
his thoughts and ideas so thoroughly and so quicklv?
True sketching is a rapid statement of facts in pic-
torial form. A few strokes and the main thought
is brought out. Unnecessary details are left out
and only a record of the important elements put
down. (Continued on paffe 38)

. UNIONISM . .
In a recent issue of a well known engineering
publication appears a lengthy discussion pro and
con on the subject of unionism among engineers.
The far-reaching effects of such an institution among
engineers make it necessary that a definite stand
be taken immediately by every engineer in order
that an undesirable situation may not arise from
such a movement.
On first thought unionism for the engineer may
seem to be of great advantage. It may appear to
be able to secure adequate compensation, recogni-
tion and appreciation for the engineer. These are
some of the things which the engineering profes-
sion often laments that it is without. Yet, on sec-
ond and more serious and analytical thought, would
trade unionism really remedy these conditions? We
do not think it would.
Let us look for a moment on the effect of union-
ism on the profession, first as it affects the ques-
tion of compensation. It would attempt to fix a
standard price on a particular type of job or on a
particular type of engineer. Taking no account of
the large personal element that is always present in
an engineer's work. This procedure would tend to
level compensation to a mediocre standard, which
might temporarily improve the lot of the poor and
mediocre engineers, but would be very dishearten-
ing to the man with ability above the average and
to the one who is able to combine executive ability
with his technical knowledge. To him such a sit-
uation would be a positive detriment. As to ob-
taining proper recognition and appreciation for the
engineer from his employer and from the public
it would fail miserably. The union might be able
to ereate considerable newspaper publicity, but this
would not be for the desirable end. Unionism would
not appeal with favor to the employer of the engi-
neer. He must take the engineer into his confi-
dence and trust him with great responsibilities. An
employer or executive would hesitate to do this if
he realized that the engineer's first loyalty and
thought was to his union and not to the company
that employed him. Likewise it would take away
the engineer's opportunity to reach executive posi-
tions, one of the big objectives of nearly every engi
neer, If unionism is to produce these effects the
engineer is better off without such an organization.
At present the engineering profession is far from
an unorganized one. Every branch of engineering
has its own representative society such as the A. S.
C. E., the A. I. E. E., the A. S. M. E., and many
others. These organizations present topics at their
meetings and distribute literature on subjects that
are pertinent to their own field and that add to the
present store of information and further the science
of engineering. This type of organization which
has as its object improvement and advancement is
the thing which will do most to help the engineer.
For in direct proportion as the engineer increases
his ability, helpfulness and service will his compen-
sation, recognition, and appreciation increase.
THE UNIVERSITY COLLEGE
At the last meeting of the faculty of the College
of Engineering and Architecture, a motion to adopt
the proposed University College was almost un;mi-
mously defeated. This action on the part of our
faculty has received the hearty support of the en-
gineering students, almost to a man. It is obvious
that the Engineering School does not believe that
the proposed University College is a solution to the
long felt want of "cultural knowledge" in the en-
gineering graduate of Michigan.
The most undesirable feature of this proposed
college is that it leaves but two years in which t&lt;
teach the engineer the facts which are necessary
if he is to be at all fitted for work in engineering
fields. Manv of the professors and instructors in
the Engineering College believe that four years is
too little a time in which to give him these neces-
sary facts. It should, be remembered by the Uni-
versity Senate, while trying to find a solution for
our wants, that the Engineering School is as much
a professional school as the School of Medicine, or
the School of Dentistry. Perhaps, if the colleges of
Engineering and Architecture were put upon this
basis, that is. the degree of A. B. required for ad-
mission, a solution to our problem would be ef-
fected.
The defeat of this proposed measure should not
be regarded as a sign that the engineers do not
wish a change in their college, but that they do not
believe that the University College is a solution to
their problem.
ENGINEERING ECONOMICS
"An engineer is a man who can handle men,
money, and material and secure efficient results; to
do this he must know how, when, where, how much,
and the cost," writes Charles N. Gould. Just how
much this statement means can be drawn from a


Page 27
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
consideration of the position which the engineer
holds in the industrial world at the present time.
With the industrial revolution came a new need
to the world. Someone must provide the power to
turn the wheels of industry. Someone must be
ready with a solution to every difficulty in order
that competition might be kept up. The power pro-
vided must be provided at minimum cost. To pro-
vide for this need came the engineer. Under his
guidance industry was given means to grow and
expand until it is so much a part of our economic
organization that the smooth running of the en-
tire social order depends upon careful control of
industry.
Such has become the magnitude of what he has
built that society now calls upon the engineer to
put forth his efforts to keep his huge machine func-
tioning properly. No longer a builder alone, or pro-
vider of giants of steel, the engineer must take upon
his shoulders the responsibilities of the social or-
der he has created. That the engineer should be
the one to take this responsibility is not to be won-
dered at. In fact, who, but one trained in the fun-
damentals of getting at the truth, working with
basic laws and meeting natural circumstance face
to face, can be expected to deal in a masterful way
with the enormous problems of industry?
The engineer of the future must prepare himself
to accept this new duty of the profession. He must
be ready to build and control machines of organiza-
tion and he must build them as efficient as he ever
built the steel giants of industry in the past, which-
ever stand as landmarks of his progress forward.
o
VISION
Visualization, according to philosophers, is the
most important part of any project, improvement,
or invention, large or small. Without careful pre-
meditation in the mind of the engineer upon the
thing he is about to perform, the chances for a
successful result are very few. Whether it is to
be the world's largest power plant, or an improved
type of safety-pin, a perfect picture of it must be
clearly seen in the engineer's mind.
One o'f the surest roads to success in engineering
practice is that of carefully and clearly thinking out
beforehand any step the engineer intends to take.
The days of cut and try in the engineering field are
gone forever; the successful engineer of today is
a man of keen, clear vision, who can accuratelv vis-
ualize not only the innovation or improvement
which is at hand, but the true function or opera-
tion of such a project. Complete knowledge of
his field is not enough for assured success, the abil-
ity to know the result beforehand is indispensable.
Those student engineers who bemoan the fact
that they have problems to solve in their classes
are not engineers, at least in the true sense of the
word. An engineer's work is nothing but the solu-
tion of problems—successfully. If one can derive
no joyful sense of satisfaction from the successful
solution of a difficult problem he does not belong
in the Engineering School.
WHO MAKES THE EXECUTIVE?
Many engineers today feel that engineering is
but a stepping stone to executive leadership, which
is indeed true, as has been many times demonstrat-
ed. There are, however, personal qualities which
enter very forcibly into the situation and one must
know how to start if he would reach the executive
goal. The start means much in every contest, and
to start wrong is worse than not to start. Merlin
H. Aylesworth, president of the National Broad-
casting Company, as an executive, gives his opin-
ion the subject thus:
"In this day and age executives are selected by
others. The board of directors of a great corpo-
ration is made up of men who are high executives
in other firms. They keep their eyes open for
promising material in their own organizations as
well as in the concerns of which they are the di-
recting heads.
"The way for the aspiring youth or older em-
ployee to become an executive is to do the job
that is given to him without regard to the time that
may be necessary, without regard to immediate
physical comfort, and without regard to any other
job that may be ahead. The employee must first
prove conclusively to his superiors that he can hold
the job that had been given to him before he can
expect consideration for higher rank in an organ-
ization.
"The success of an enterprise depends on getting
the right man for the light place. Those above are
likely to know better than you do what they want
from you. Let them have it until you have proved
your superiority to the work that you are doing.
"My advice to ambitious youth is to be exceed-
ingly careful before taking a new position, to look
over its difficulties and disadvantages as well as
its rosy aspects and not to leave a firm that you like
and respect without being sure that the new one
is equal in integrity, as sound, and will offer as
permanent employment as the one with which you
are associated.
"As for personal advice, I would say the best
guarantee of success is to keep physically healthy
while forcing your brain to be ever active and
progressive.
"No man can choose an executive position for
himself. If he shows courage, initiative and intel-
ligence, and is willing to assume real responsibility
he will find, however, that other executives will
elect him to membership in their ranks."

Weighing By Radio
One of the latest applications of the radio prin-
ciple appears in a weighing machine developed by
the laboratory staff of a large New England pro-
ducer of pulp and paper. This unique device auto-
matically weighs any materials, such as paper, rub-
ber, chewing gum and coated fabrics, passing
through the mechanism in continuous web form.
This is accomplished at full machine speed without
touching the web of the material at any point.
The principles underlying this unusual develop-
ment are those of the tuned radio circuit. The web
of the material passes between two parallel metal
plates which act as a condenser in the receiving cir-
cuit. Variations in the weight of the fabric change
the capacity of the condenser and affect the re-
sponse of the circuit to a wave of controlled fre-
quency. These variations are shown on a meter
connected in the circuit and may be used to oper-
ate machine controls by suitable relays. The ma-
chine is of great service in maintaining uniformity
in the weighing of paper and an adaptation of th"
device mav be used to register the moisture content
of the paper.—Journal A. I. E. E.
New Loud Speaker Hurls Man's Voice A Mile
Across Hudson in Novel Test
"Have you a voice that carries well?"
That used to be a very important question asked
of every man who aspired to be a public speaker.
But nowadays is really doesn't matter whether
he has leather lungs and a siren voice or not. As
long as he can talk at all, people a mile away can
plainly hear his every word. How? It's a new
loud speaker that does the trick.
On an icy cold Sunday morning not long ago, a
little group of men clustered around a field tele-
phone at the top of a cliff in Hoboken, N. J., over-
looking the Hudson River. A mile away, on the
New York side of the river, the loud speaker was
mounted on the roof of the thirteen-story Bell Tele-
phone Laboratories building. One of the men in
the Hoboken group spoke into the field telephone
which was connected with an ordinary Western
Electric amplifier in the Laboratories — the loud
speaker, in turn, being connected with the amplifier.
"Hello, Hopkins! Can you hear me?" the man
said, in an ordinary tone of voice.
Five seconds later, a giant voice coming from the
mouth of the horn in New York, a mile away, star-
tled the listeners.
"HELLO, HOPKINS! CAN YOU HEAR
ME?" it boomed.
And so, for the first time, a human voice was
thrown, without the slightest distortion, for a dis-
tance of one mile.
The loud speaker was developed by the engineers
of Bell Telephone Laboratories primarily for West-
ern Electric public address systems and for use in
connection with talking motion pictures. It is now
being successfully used in presenting both Vita-
phone and Movietone productions, for which the
Western Electric manufactures sound projector
equipment. The Hudson River demonstration was
the first to be made in the open air, however, and
at such a distance. As a result of this demonstra-
tion, its sponsors estimate that a round million of
people can listen to a speaker or to the strains of
music. Imagine what this will mean to our ora-
tors in a political campaign!
In its present form, the loud speaker is of the horn
type. The engineers who developed it say that it is
capable of converting into sound about 50 per cent
of the electrical energy supplied it. The moving
diaphragm or armature of its receiver is not made
of a magnetic material but consists of a sheet of
very light aluminum alloy, about two-thousandths
of an inch thick, and so constructed that it moves
laterally, somewhat like a piston. Attached to the
diaphragm is a small coil of aluminum strip wound
edgewise and insulated with varnish. This coil lies
in the magnetic field produced by a -powerful elec-
tromagnet.
Telephone or voice current passing through the
small aluminum winding causes the diaphragm to
vibrate. The plunger-like motion of the diaphragm
and the special shaping of the air chamber between
the diaphragm and the mouth of the horn result
in an efficiency many times greater than that ob-
tained with other types of loud speakers. The load
carrying capacity of the device arises from the fact
that the small aluminum coil lies very close to the
heavy iron pole-pieces of the field magnet.
In addition to its large capacity, the loud speaker


Page 29
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
is notable for its fine reproducing qualities. It en-
compasses the range of frequencies from 60 to 6,000
cycles per second without distortion and reproduc-
es down to 40 cycles and up to 8,000 cycles with a
distortion so slight that it is doubtful if the ear can
detect it,
At the recent outdoor demonstration of the horn,
any number of tests of its efficiency were made.
Passing ferry boats on the river were hailed and
their pilots asked to toot their whistles as a signal
that the messages were clearly heard. A phono-
graph was set up near the loud speaker on the roof
of the Bell Laboratories and five or six seconds
later sounds of music from the record came with
the utmost clearness and distinctness to the listen-
ers in Hoboken—(five seconds being the approxi-
mate length of time required for the sound to travel
through the air for one mile across the Hudson from
the loud speaker). Mrs. R. W. King, wife of the
engineer in charge of the demonstration, sang over
a telephone which connected her home in Short
Hills. NT. J., with the Bell Laboratories, and this,
too, was sent through the loud speaker, to the de-
light of the little group in Hoboken.
It is this far-flung broadcasting of music, as well
as of speech, that makes the new loud speaker of
so much interest for the future. With it great
crowds in public places can dance or listen to music
even though a long distance away from its source.
And as for being able to hear a speaker, even in
the largest convention halls or out in "the wide
open spaces," that will be no trick at all!

Varied Winter Temperatures Call For
Non-Evaporating Anti-Freeze
The present mild weather which has prevailed
generally throughout the country calls attention to
the necessity of using a proper anti-freeze solution
in the radiators of cars. ,According to the National
Glycerine Service of the Procter and Gamble Com-
pany, thousands of automobiles were caught un-
awares during the recent cold wave which swept
the country. Many of these drivers thought they
were protected because they had an anti-freeze in
the radiators of their cars prior to the cold wave, but
due to running their cars during the warm period
which preceded the cold wave, those who failed
to use a non-volatile solution had lost their pro-
tection, through evaporation.
The greatest value of the glycerine anti-freeze
solution lies in the fact that it is permanent and is
not subject to change in the varied weather which
prevails in most parts of the United States. In fact,
it is pointed out, there is more need for the use of
glycerine anti-freeze in a mild climate than there is
in a climate that is steadily below freezing. For this
reason, motorists are recommended not to wait un-
til a cold wave comes but to provide their cars with
anti-freeze solution during the present mild weather
conditions.
It is interesting at this time to review the rapid
increase in the use of distilled glycerine since its
introduction a few years ago. Over 300,000 motor-
ists in Canada and the United States used distilled
glycerine as an anti-freeze last winter, and it is es-
timated that as many more will use it this year.
These cars include all types and makes of private
cars, taxicabs, trucks and buses.
Distilled glycerine has many advantages not pres-
ent in ordinary anti-freeze mixtures now in common
use.
As it does not evaporate, one filling of the cooling
system at the beginning of the winter driving sea-
son will last indefinitely provided that none of the
solution is lost through the overflow pipe or leak-
age. It has a boiling point many degrees higher
than alcohol and even on mild winter days the
motor will not overheat. This causes the motor to
operate at a more efficient temperature. Glycerine
is odorless, a feature that drivers of closed cars will
readily appreciate. If any is spilled upon the hood
of a car while filling the radiator no harm will result
as glycerine will not damage the finest finish. This
is especially advantageous in the case of the lacquer
finishes which are so popular today, as alcohol, par-
ticularly when hot, will cause serious damage,
Glycerine is non-inflammable so there is no fire risk
to either the car or the occupants.
It has been definitely established by leading chem-
ical and automotive engineers that distilled glycer-
ine will not eat rubber or gasket material and will
not attack the metal parts of the motor or radiator.
The virtues of distilled glycerine as an anti-freeze
have long been known to automotive engineers and
technical men, but it is only comparatively recently
that the correct grade known as "radiator glycerine"
was made available to the motoring public.

ponderous devices, exerting such enormous pressure
that billets of brass two feet or more long and some
five inches or more in diameter are forced through
the dies so swiftly and easily that anyone unfamiliar
with the terrific power of modern machinery would
be tempted into thinking the billets made of some
material many times softer than hot brass.
The extrusion method has supplanted nearly all
others in the making of practically all the brass rod
turned out in the country, as shapes as thin as one-
tenth of an inch may be extruded successfully.
In the great mills near Detroit, as in most others,
electric melting furnaces have largely supplanted the

Items of Interest to Michigan Engineers
Engineering Open House
Way back in the "dear dead days beyond recall"
the engineers of Michigan would set aside a couple
of days in which to put on an exhibition—to do
their stuff as it were—for the sole purpose of let-
ting the rest of the campus, and the world in gen-
eral, know that there was such a thing as an engi-
neering college on the campus and to check the
opinion that nothing good ever came from the "en-
gine school." Models were constructed, demonstra-
tions were arranged, and the doors of the college
were opened wide to all comers. Invitations were
extended to other state institutions, to high schools
and colleges, or, in general, to everyone interested.
They were discontinued during the war but are
to be started again this year. Much time and
thought have been put on the proposed plans for
this year's exhibition which will undoubtedly be one
of the most successful of its kind. The date for the
Open House is set for March 23 and 24.
Scabbard and Blade
At the annual election of officers of Scabbard
and Blade on Thursday, February 23rd, Scuddcr
M. Griffing was elected captain; Patrick E. Mc-
Caughey, first lieutenant; P. C. Knickerbocker, sec-
ond lieutenant; and Charles E. Staff, first sergeant.
Larry Spitzcr, the retiring captain, gave a brief
summary of the work that is to be carried out dur-
ing the next year in his welcoming address to the
new officers. Mr. Spitzer recently became the fa-
ther of a future Michigan man and the company ap-
preciates the untiring efforts he has given it in his
services as captain even with all these handicaps.
The Military Ball'is the question of most moment
just now, and the Scabbard and Blade men have
pledged their strength unanimously to support the
traditional dance. From the looks of things at
present, the most important duty will be that of
making it a social success, as the financial side of
the undertaking has taken care of itself more or
less through the large advance subscription of
tickets.
lota Alpha
Iota Alpha has been holding its regular monthly
meetings throughout the school year. ' At the last
meeting held Feb. 17th, Mr. Abbott of the Timken
Bearing Co. spoke on "The Elimination and In-
spection of Gear Sounds." He supplemented his
talk with demonstrations on a very interesting piece
of apparatus. In the first attempt to detect and
analyze gear sounds a microphone was used. But
it was found that the microphone was of little use
in that it measured only the intensity of the sound.
So an analyzing circuit was incorporated into the
apparatus with the result that a sound may be
picked to pieces and broken down into its many
simpler sounds. The apparatus has a selective
range which includes sounds between 200 and 700
cycles. With the use of this apparatus disagree-
able sounds may be detected and steps taken to-
ward their elimination. It finds its greatest use
in the field of automotive engineering although it
may be used in various other fields.

The student branch of the American Institute
of Electrical Engineers has held one meeting so far
this semester and has plans for several more very
interesting ones on foot. On Feb. 15th, Mr. Hunt
of the engineering department of the General Mo-
tors Corporation gave an interesting talk to the
society. In spite of the fact that there were two
other meetings for engineers on the same night
there was a good attendance.
If the present plans carry through a representa-
tive from the General Electric Company will make
a trip through the Great Lakes District giving an
engineering lecture before the various student
branches of the A. I. E. E. This lecture will be il-
lustrated with motion pictures and will come to Ann
Arbor on April 30.
Motion pictures of the building of the generat-
ing station at Conowingo will probably be shown
at a meeting to be held some time in May. These
films were made by Stone and Webster, Inc.
A. S. M. E.
Under the leadership of its president the student
branch of the A. S. M. E. has enjoyed and contin-
ues to enjoy one of its most successful years. Of-
ficers were elected at the beginning of,the year and
these honors fell upon Perry M. Shoemaker, presi-

dent; Allen Salisbury; vice-president; and Francis
Norquist, secretary and treasurer. Prof. R. S. Ilaw-
'ley was elected honorary chairman.
Activities of the society have consisted of a stu-
dent-faculty dinner of the mechanical engineering
department, several lectures, and the presentation
of a number of films of a technical nature. "Steam,"
a Babcock and Wilcox production; "The Age of
Speed," and "The Thirtieth Part of a Hair," both
Norton films, have been shown in the Natural
Science Auditorium under the auspices of the stu-
dent branch.
Papers have been prepared and read upon several
occasions by different members. They have been
of both technical and non-technical nature. The
faculty has co-operated with the society in this re-
spect and has given considerable time to the prep-
aration and presentation of interesting lectures on
various occasions.
A. I. Cb. E.
Although the student branch of the American So-
ciety of Chemical Engineers was rather dormant
during the first semester, it has of late become quite
active. On January 16th the society held an impor-
tant meeting at which Dr. H. II. Dow of the Dow
Chemical Co. was the principal speaker. Mr. Dow
discussed several of the company's varied products,
laying stress on the utilization of all possible by-
products. A company of the size of the Dow Chem-
ical Company depends a great deal on these by-prod-
ucts and spends a large amount of money annually
in making the efficiency of their plants such that
every possible bit of material is used to its fullest
extent.
At this meeting there were about seventy mem-
bers present. After the speech cider and dough-
nuts were served. Plans were discussed concern-
ing future meetings with the result that things look
bright for the society at present. A meeting was
planned for the week of February 20th and one
for some time in April. The society meets in room
3205 of the East Engineering Building and wel-
comes any chemical engineer who is interested in
the activities of the society. o—
Transportation Club
We wonder if the Transportation Club will be
able to keep up the pace this semester that it held
last semester. It has a very long list of successful
undertakings to its credit up to date. But even if
it is not able to take part in as many outstanding
events this semester as last, it will, we are sure,
continue to hold its own as far as popularity is con-
cerned.
On Feb. 14th the club had as its speaker Prof.
H. C. Sadler, who gave the club a talk on the
United States Merchant Marine. It has been a long
time since America has had a merehant marine
which could hope to compete with that of other
nations. Yet the several attempts which have been
made to strengthen our merchant marine have not
had a very marked effect on our status. There is a
movement on foot to build several large ships which
will have a super-efficiency and super-speed. These
ships are planned to cut down. the time of crossing
the Atlantic from six to four days. Such ships
would obviously be in great ;demand. Members
of the Highway Conference were-the club's guests
at this meeting.
Plans for future meeting arc under way but are
not vet readv for announcement.
Michigan Conference on Highway Engineering
The fourteenth annual session of the Michigan
Conference on Highway Engineering opened Feb.
14th, with a meeting held in the West Engineering
Building. The morning session was taken up with
registration and inspection of the engineering labor-
atories and shops.
The afternoon session was devoted to speeches
on three different phases of highway engineering.
H. S. Mattimore of the Pennsylvania State High-
way Department spoke on "The Field Control of
Pavement Concrete." The next speaker was C. N.
Connor of the highway research board, Washing-
ton, D. C., who spoke on "The Low Cost of Im-
proved Roads." The last speaker was Associate
Professor F. C. Lang of the University of Minne-
sota. Prof. Lang discussed the topic "Bituminous
Treatments of Gravel Roads and Earth Sub-
grades."
The evening session consisted of a smoker held
at the Union at which time speeches were given by
Pres. Clarence Cook Little, Prof. John S, Worley.
and Lieutenant George P. Finch. Pres. Little's
speech was an address of welcome. Prof. Worley's
a discussion of "The History of Roads," and that
of Lieutenant Finch, "Aviation and Airports."
During the Wednesday session several speeches
were delivered by prominent engineers and pro-
fessors of engineering. The speeches were "The
Study of Concrete Pavement from Core Records/'
by C. E. Foster, construction engineer; "Snow Re-
moval," by V. R. Burton, of the State Highway De-
partment; "Trends of Bituminous Pavement De-
sign," by Prof. W. I. Emmons, of the highway en-
gineering department; "The Use of Timber for
Secondary Highway Bridges." by C. A. Melick,
bridge engineer: "The Maintenance and Develop-
ment of Roadsides," by Phelps Vogelsang, forest-
er, and "The Personnel of a Maintenance Organ-
ization," by S. J. Stewart, of the Michigan State
Highway Department.
The Thursday afternoon meeting saw the elec-
tion of officers of the association of county road

commissioners and engineers. The results of the
elections were: President, W. W. Cox of St. Clair
county; John L. Brumm, road commissioner; vice-
president, C. W. McKella, road commissioner of
Washtenaw county; and secretary-treasurer, K. I.
Sawyer, county engineer of Marquette county. A
board of directors consisting of the three officers,
Herman Munden, and W. J. Barber was also ap-
pointed. After considerable discussion a resolution
was passed by the conference recommending that the
different counties adopt a system of numbering of
highways such that the numbers of the roads should
remain continuous from county to county through-
out the state. The remainder of the session was
taken up with speeches by three more engineers.
W. J. Lehner gave a talk on "Economics of Road-
side Cleanup." C. F. Winkler spoke on the sub-
ject of "Maintenance Equipment." G. C. Dillman
spoke on "County Road Numbering."
A banquet was held Thursday night at the Union.
The principal speakers were W. M. Connelly, F. F.
Rogers, Judge H. A. Wood, and Prof. John I..
Brumm. The banquet was a very successful af-
fair, there being considerably more than 400 people
in attendance.
The Friday morning session was the final meet-
ing. At that time Mr. Elliott, Mr. Sorenson, and
Lieut. Lawrence A. Lyons read papers on differ-
ent phases of engineering. With the end of this
session the conference was brought to a close.
Military Ball
For a while it looked as though there would be
no military ball this year. 'Twould have been a
sad state of affairs to deprive the socially inclined
members of the campus of this time-honored annual
fete. Quite naturally and quite justly these pound-
ers of the ballroom floor took it upon themselves
to set up a hue and cry such that might be heard
the world around or at least in the social circles
of Ann Arbor. It still remains to be seen whether
the smoke produced the fire or the fire produced the
smoke. Leastwise the heat set the machinery into
motion so that the ball is in a high state of com-
pletion. The date is set for April 28th and unless
some unforeseen bomb explodes under the present
arrangements, that date is fixed. There are only
about sixty tickets left so if you have desires to
stamp your feet with the army the best results will
be obtained by applying early for your pasteboards.
Civil Engineering Department
Mr. Housel of the C. E. Department, assisted by
Gordon Robertson and Herman Eichenhofer is en-
gaged in the study of physical characteristics of
soil which govern the bearing capacity for founda-
tions. A study of transmission of pressure in co-
hesive soils is an important part of the investiga-
tion. Through the courtesy of the State Highway
Laboratory the facilities of their soil laboratory
have been made available for this investigation.
This laboratory investigation is being carried on
in connection with the field work which has been
conducted by the Wayne County Road Commission
during 1927.
Mechanical Engineering Department
Professors C. H. Fessenden and A. Marin, of the
M. E. Department have just begun investigations
on a very interesting research problem. The object
of the research is to ascertain the effect of paint
on the rate of heat radiation from steam radiators.
They have developed some very unique and effi-
cient apparatus for the measurement of heat qual-
ities.
Prof. Emswiler is at present carrying on consid-
erable research work in the field of natural venti-
lation.
Prof. Keeler has been investigating several dif-
ferent phases of refrigeration for some time. We
hope to get a few more details concerning this
project when it has reached a higher stage of com-
pletion.
Marine Engineering
Prof. Sadler of the Marine Engineering Depart-
ment has been appointed as a member of a com-
mittee composed of three naval architects to act
in connection with the design of six proposed trans-
Atlantic liners. The design and construction of
these vessels will be one of the biggest undertakings
of its kind ever attempted. The ships are to be
about 900 feet long, arc to have a speed of 35
knots, and are to be operated with power units
which will develop a rating of 160,000 horse power.
They are expected to reduce the voyage time to
four days. They are to have aeroplane decks \vhich
will make it possible to use aeroplanes for the car-
rying of mail. It is expected that with the use of
the aeroplanes the trans-Atlantic mail service will
be shortened to three davs.
The bore tells you the story of his life, the genius
sells it to a magazine.
Once upon a time a man was bit, and otherwise
chewed upon, by a dog suffering from rabies. The
man's friends advised him to undergo the Pasteur
treatment. But, as all good advice is treated,
the man heeded it not. One day our hero
was seen making out a list of names. He was
asked if that was to be his will, to which he replied:
"H 1, no, this is a list of people I am going to
bite if I go mad."

Echoes frcm the Graduates
PROFESSOR WILLIAM JOSEPH HUSSEY-
A MEMORIAL
WILLIAM JOSEPH HUSSEY, Professor of
Astronomy, and fifth director of the De-
troit Astronomical Observatory of the
University of Michigan, died in London on the
twenty-eighth day of October, 1926. Three weeks
before, he had set out from Ann Arbor via London
for Bloemfontein, South Af-
rica, on a project that
marked the culmination of
years of planning and effort
— a project involving the
erection of an observatory
and the installation of the
twenty-seven-inch Lamont
telescope primarily for the
prosecution of a double star
survey of the southern skies.
While waiting to continue
his journey from London,
death, caused by heart fail-
ure, came instantly as he and
Mrs. Hussey conversed with
friends at the dinner table.
Born on a farm in Ohio,
August 10, 1862, of a family
with limited funds, he did
not gain an education with-
out a struggle. Teaching
and other work needed to
eke out available resources
interfered with progress in
study to such an extent that
it was not until 1889 that
professor Hussey received
his bachelor's degree. He graduated in civil engi-
neering from the University of Michigan with a
brilliant record. For a time in 1889 he was an as-
sistant in the Nautical Almanac office at Washing-
ton, D. C.
Then began a period of seven years devoted prin-
cipally to teaching. Instructor for three years at
Michigan in mathematics and astronomy, and act-
ing director of the Detroit Observatory during the
PROF. WILLIAM JOSEPH HUSSEY
last one of these years, he was called to Leland
Stanford Junior University as assistant professor
of astronomy in 1892 and rose in three years' time
to a full professorship in that subject. During this
period he frequently visited the Lick observatory
as a volunteer observer. It was during these years
that his remarkable photo-
graphs and s t u d i e s of the
physical characteristics o f
comet Rordame were made.
His appointment to Lick ob-
servatory as successor to the
famous Barnard c a m e in
1895.
The years as astronomer
at Lick observatory, from
18% to 1905, formed for Pro-
fessor Hussey a period of
most intense activity in re-
search. His studies of com-
ets, planets, satellites and as-
teroids, and, most of all, his
e p o c h-making discoveries,
measures and other investi-
gations of double stars
brought h i m international
distinction and the widest
recognition.
His most notable achieve-
ments at Lick observatory
were his observations of the
double stars discovered at
Pulkowa and his discovery
and observation of 1338 new
double stars. The report of the former studies fills
Volume V of the Lick Observatory Publications, a
model of its kind. The discoveries of double stars
resulted from a survey begun in 1899. This great
work with related investigations won for Profes-
sor Hussey the Lalande Gold Medal of the French
Academy in 1906. Subsequently, at La Plata, ob-
serving in the southern skies, he increased the total
of his double star discoveries to 1650.


March. 1928
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
In October, 1905, Dr. Hussey returned to Michi-
gan as Professor of Astronomy and director of the
observatory. Though always assuming his full
share of teaching, in which he was notably success-
ful, and finding time for countless other tasks, he
nevertheless kept before him always the larger prob-
lems connected with the growth and extension of
the observatory. The initial program of construc-
tion for Ann Arbor, beginning with the buildings,
instrument shop and small instruments, culminated
in the 37jj-inch reflector which was completed with
its spectograph equipment and auxiliaries in 1911.
At this juncture there came an opportunity for
similar offices at a great southern institution. The
observatory at ha Plata, in Argentina, had ex-
pended considerable sums of money, but then lay
dormant with a group of sightly buildings and a
complement of equipment needing only the atten-
tion of experts to make it productive. A co-oper-
ative arrangement was formulated under w h i c h
Professor Ilussey was to add the duties of the pro-
fessorship in astronomy and Geodesy at the Na-
tional University of Argentina in ha Plata to those
at the University of Michigan, dividing his time
about equally between the two institutions. When
this was quickly approved by the regents of the
University of Michigan, the incident was a source
of much gratification to many interested in the bet-
terment of Pan-American relations and to those in-
terested in scientific progress.
Professor Hussey's arrival at Argentina marked
the beginning of a period of rapid progress at ha
Plata. The co-operative arrangement with ha Plata
University continued for six years. But regular
observations with refractor, meridian circle and
other instruments, begun at this time on a large
scale, continue today through the able efforts of
Dawson, Manganiello, Martinez, and others. The
eighth of a series of ha Plata volumes, a series be-
gun by Professor Husscy in 1914 and containing the
results of work much of which was directly organ
ized and inspired by him, is now on our shelves, and
the end is surely not yet.
It was in 1908 that Mr. R. P. hanion,t; of Chicago,
a friend since college days, was ready to finance
the plan for observation of double stars in the
southern skies, which Professor Hussey and he had
kept in mind for a number of years. Designs and
detailed drawings for a telescope mounting began
at Ann Arbor in 1910. A contract for a 24-inch
lens was placed with the Alvan Clark and Sons
Corporation in 1911, but so great were the difficul-
ties of the manufacture and perfect finish of such
a lens, especially because of the interruption of the
World War, that it was not until early in January,
1925, .that the lens, then increased in aperture to
27 inches, ;irrived in Ann Arbor to prove itself on
the stars in .its finished mounting. Through diffi-
culties encountered in securing a satisfactory con-
tract for the 56-foot dome needed for the successful
operation of the telescope, yet more delay followed.
Just before the expedition sailed for Africa in Oc-
tober last, this obstacle wyas overcome, and full of
hope, the mechanical arrangements fully perfected,
the party set out for Bloemfontein. Only three
weeks later death prevented Professor Ilussey
from completing the work of his desire for so many
years, but so fully had he planned the whole project
that his death merely left to those he had already
associated with him the task of securing the scien-
tific results that will in a very real sense serve as
one of the many memorials left us of the highly sig-
nificant achievements of his life.
But this southern expedition, important to the
scientific world and dear to his heart as it was, by
no means represents all the constructive results of
the last years of his life. The work in Ann Arbor
called for enlargement and improvement in two im-
portant directions. For instructional work there-
was much needed the establishment and equipment
of the astronomical laboratories on the upper floor
of Angell Hall. His plans for these had been prac-
tically realized before he left Ann Arbor. For manv
kinds of research work the present observatory by
the encroachment of railroad, power house, hos-
pitals, nurses' home and other close buildings had
become untenable. A new site, far from disturb-
ing conditions, was necessary to fine observational
work, and this had already been selected, and plans
begun for a suitable building and equipment. The
fruition of these plans he has left to his successors
to build on his foundations.
Honors began coming to Professor Hussey early
in his career. He was elected president of the As-
tronomical Society of the Pacific for the term of
1896-1897. In 1903, he was made a foreign asso-
ciate of the Royal Astronomical Society of hondon.
The following \ear he was made an honorary mem-
ber of the Mexican Astronomical Society. In 1906
he .received the halandc prize of the French Acad-
emy for discoveries and investigations of double
stars. He was secretary of the American Astro-
nomical Society from 1908 to 1912 and during that
time compiled the initial volume of the publications
of that society and edited part of the second vol-
ume. He also served two terms on the council of
this society. He received the honorary degree of
Sc. D. from Brown University in 1912 and served
as president of the Research Club of the Univer-
sity of Michigan for the term 1919-1920.
His publications began to appear early. "Logar-
ithims and Other Mathematical Tables," and "Math-
ematical Theories of Planetary Motions" (a trans-
lation by Harrington and Hussey), together with
several technical papers appeared during his early
residence at Michigan and Stanford universities.

THE MICHIGAN TECH NIC
While at Lick observatory his "Micrometrical Ob-
servations of Double Stars discovered at Pulkowa"
appeared as Volume V of the Lick Observatory
Publications, and in addition he contributed about
130 technical articles to various astronomical peri-
odicals during that time. Subsequently, the total
of his technical articles had increased to more than
one hundred and seventy.
Professor Hussey's only respite from hard work
was found in travel and his journeys were always
of an expeditionary character. In 1903 his search
for observatory sites in behalf of the Carnegie In-
stitution took him to Arizona, Southern California,
and Australia. At this time he reported favorably
on the present site of Mount Wilson observatory.
In 1905 he headed the very successful Lick observ-
atory expedition to Egypt. In 1911 his four jour-
neys to La Plata began. In 1912 he conducted an
eclipse expedition to Brazil, but clouds prevented
observation. In 1923 he extended his search for
observatory sites to Africa. In 1925 at Geneva,
New York, he sat in the basket of a balloon ready
to ascend under perilous conditions to observe the
eclipsed sun from an elevation above the clouds.
Expert balloonists forbade the flight. He was em-
barking on the major expedition of his career when
death came.
Class work with Professor Hussey was a sacred
duty—one that he met with more than full meas-
ure. And his students, on their part, manifested an
attitude of respectful intimacy, amounting frequent-
ly to affection. No class of his could be so large
that one student could be denied. No class was
ever withdrawn, however small the registration.
If only one student persevered in a graduate course
the class met as usual. When this point was raised
Professor Hussey often quoted Brunnow's rejoinder
when the latter's attention was called to his one
advanced student. "But that student is Watson."
An obituary of Professor Hussey published in
the widely read Journal of the British Astronom-
ical Association contains the following statement,
"Under this extraordinary organizing ability the
observatory of Brunnow and Watson expanded,
and the University of Michigan became the most
important center of astronomical instruction in the
States . . ." This is not the place to comment,
except to say that one of Professor Hussey's prom-
inent aims is thus well stated.
When reviewing a career we tend to sec the more
tangible accomplishments — the buildings, instru-
ments, scientific contributions. Results in the class-
room in comparison are too often dimly visible,
though the students are numbered by thousands.
A few become disciples, more carry away a life
interest, and many more pass on with an impres-
sion more or less profound. Such results of his
class room labors gave Professor Hussey the deep-
est satisfaction, and former students who returned
for a visit or a chat brought him some of his hap-
piest moments.
Comparatively few are endowed with the gift of
great ability as instructors, fewer, perhaps, can
achieve notable results in the field of research by
real additions to the world's store of knowledge.
Some have one ability to a conspicuous degree, while
almost lacking in the other. Professor Hussey was
one of those rare men who achieved distinction to
an exceptional extent in both directions. When
such a man passes the world is poorer indeed. Add
to this the instinctive fineness and graciousness of
his character, his seemingly inexhaustible .patience
at every opportunity to serve his fellows, either in
or out of his profession, and his proved ability as an
administrator of large vision and great effective-
ness, and his passing from us while yet he seemed
to have years of usefulness before him is a loss we
shall not try to measure. We can comfort our-
selves with the satisfaction that we who knew him.
and the world that benefited by his work, are in-
deed richer because he lived and wrought.

ARCHITECTURE BUILDING
(Continued from page 13)
dining tables in fraternity houses, the chairs are
kitchen chairs, but the books make this architec-
tural library one of the finest in the country. There
are four thousand volumes and some huge folios
that lie upon their sides in individual shelves; in
fact most of the architectural books are too large
to stand on end. The floor of the library is cork;
the windows, some arched, some square, all with
small panes, lend to the charm of the room. Before
the two end windows are hung racks in which are
placed the lantern slides that had been used in the
morning lecture so that the students may come here
to review that lecture. In an adjoining room are
15,000 slides with opal-glass slide tables lighted
from beneath where lectures may be laid out in
advance. Former students have contributed over
$6000 to the library fund, among the contributors
being Kenneth C. Welsh, Warren S. Holmes and
Walter C. Lentz, who gave $1000 each. The shelves
permit indefinite expansion.
The west side of the upper floors opening upon
the inner court, where the light is not good for
drawing and drafting rooms, arc apportioned to
faculty offices and exhibition corridors.
The second and third floors of the east wing are
principally occupied by the two-story museum in
which full-sized casts will be placed which will
bring home to the students the scale of design of
well-known monuments. All of the exhibition
pieces will be wall pieces. George Booth, of De-
troit, presented the College of Architecture with a
fund of $10,000 for the purchase of exhibition pieces
for this room. French doors with a little balcony
open upon the museum from the third floor cor-
ridor.
The north wing of the third floor is a long studio
with ceiling-high arched windows admitting the
north light. The room is divided into four sepa-
rate studios by partitions covered with burlap upon
which are hung pictures and plaster models, and in
these partitions are lockers holding the drawing
boards of the art students. In one studio are placed
a series of still life sets and innumerable easels for
the young artists. In another division are large
casts of famous statues for drawing models. The
large windows offer a delightful view of the gar-
dens of the dormitory with the William L. Clem-
ents Library and other buildings in the background.
The angles of the ceiling present perspective prob-
lems for the freshman class. Small windows, which
will be heavily curtained when funds permit, offer
a cross-draft in the studio, when the weather re
quires, and do not cause a cross-light. The walls
are of white limestone-brick which form a light
neutral background. Incidentally the brick used in
this room and in the three drafting rooms below
was furnished by the manufacturers, and the bronze
window casings throughout the building were sup-
plied at the cost of steel casings, which was a great
saving. Two hundred and fifty art students use
this studio and students from all the colleges of
the University who desire to paint or draw gather
here.
A small studio in the tower is used for the life
class. Here twenty-seven advanced students gather
to draw campus athletes. The position of model is
much demanded by athletic students who are work-
ing their way through the University because it is
one of the best paid jobs about the campus, paying
75c an hour.
The tower rooms are unfinished. One will be
used ultimately by a noted visiting artist, the other
as a faculty studio for creative work. The view
from the top studio is one of the best from any
campus building; looking to the west down upon
the Lawyers club, the LTnion, Martha Cook dormi-
tory, the William L. Clements library and Old
Universitv Hall.

At present only the east and north wings of the
Architecture Building have been constructed. The
finished plans call for a building forming a hollow
square with a wing to be constructed on Monroe
street and one facing on Tappan avenue. However
there is at present no appropriation for the comple-
tion of the building. The square bounded at pres-
ent by the two wings of the building is to be laid
out in a formal garden in the spring. Pitkin and
Mott will do the planting. The garden is to be so
arranged that no transplanting will be necessary
when the other wings are built to wall it in. A foun-
tain will play in the center of the garden; pos-
sibly some of the $5000 donated by Mrs. E. E.
Hartwick will be used as this gift was for general
use.
Indeed this is a building designed by the Uni-
versity, built by the state, and aided by alumni and
friends of the department it houses.—W. A.
ing. The popularity of such courses is proven by
the steadily increasing demand for them. New and
additional courses have been added to the schedule
and will continue to be added and as long as there is
a request for them.
SKETCHING
'Continued from page 25)
It might be said that the highest aim of the
sketcher is. to develop a technique fully adapted to
the kind of subject required, yet so easily and un-
consciously employed that it intrudes itself in no
way upon the interest and value of the subject as
such, producing an effect, when finished, of perfect
harmony and unlabored effort. Many would be
surprised to know how much work lies behind ef-
ficient sketching, but it is work that has either
definitely been directed towards the development
of an individual technique or has just naturally led
toward it. Possibly one of the main attractions in
sketching is the chances there are of discovering a
new technique of one's own.
There is still one other point in favor of sketch-
ing for the student and that is the possibilities of
financial gain. Innumerable men and women have
and are now paying their way through school with
money earned in this manner because they have cul-
tivated their ability to draw. Some have the for-
tune to become student instructors while others
do illustrating for various business firms. In one
case, for example, a student has earned his capital
by doing pencil and crayon portrait studies of his
fellow students. His work is so much in demand
that he found little difficulty in paying most, if not
all, of his expenses in this manner.
Turning to work done in our own university, the
illustrations accompanying this article show some-
thing of what has been accomplished the past semes-
ter along this line. The drawings have been done
in different mediums by students in the classes for
that type of work. These classes are held in the
new Architecture Building and, while most of the
students are architectural students, many are liter-
ary students who have a natural talent for dravv-

seen. This change has to a certain extent done away
with one of the most picturesque stages in the whole
process and rendered far less important the part
played by the caster himself in the operation. With
the open crucible, only the experience of the caster
in judging the right mixture by its appearance told
him when the instant for pouring had come; in the
electric furnace, the human element is largely elim-
inated—and with it the chance of error. On the
economic side, the electric furnace effects a very
considerable saving, as there was much loss of zinc
through volatilization with the open crucible.
It need hardly be added that the enormous de-
mands of the war had a profound effect upon the
copper and brass industry in this country. On the
first of January, 1916, the output of the various
American plants was triple what it had been in
January, 1914, and this figure had been still further
increased by the middle of 1918. Nor was the im-
petus given by the war limited to increased output.
It came at a time when many of the recent devel-
opments on the technical side were new and com-
paratively untried, and the immense and pressing
demands (such as the insatiable requirement for me-
tallic ammunition in unprecedented quantities) com-
pelled a much wider and more rapid spread of these
new processes and devices throughout the country
than would otherwise have taken place.
A trip through either of the huge Detroit plants
to which reference has been made in this sketch can
hardly fail to be impressive, whether or not the ob,-
server possess anv technical familiarity with what
he witnesses. A list of the various forms in which
the products of these plants find their way to the
market would have formidable dimensions, and the
number and diversity of manufacturing plants they
reach is revealed by a hurried examination of the
labels on the packages in the shipping rooms, wheth-
er they are huge crates containing great sheets of
polished copper or chunky boxes packed full of
spools of fine wire.
Even a hasty visit cannot fail to leave an im-
pression of an industry simple in its general lines,
yet developed in every detail to an extraordinary
degree of efficiency, and a positively overwhelming
array of raw materials, machinery and finished prod-
uct, one glance at which is sufficient to understand
that new rank to which Michigan has risen in an
industry in which she had no place whatsoever a
quarter of a century ago.

Westinghouse, having

ENGINEERING TEACHING As A PROFESSION
By A. D, MOOPK
T
HERE are fifty thousand students in engi- paper addressed primarily to seniors and designed
neering courses in this country today. Most to tell them about the teaching profession. The ed-
of them are looking forward to getting into itors of the Technic may have discovered this lack;
engineering practice ot one
kind or another. Naturally.
they wish to know what it is
going to be like. Thousands of
speeches and articles are de-
voted each year to the attempt
to tell them about it. The Mich-
igan Technic this year has con-
tributed its generous share of
such articles. All of this activ-
ity is most commendable, and
much of it is admirably done:
a great deal of good is accom-
plished in eliminating false im-
pressions from the mmds of
undergraduates, and supplant-
ing it with real information.
With so many students in
engineering, it follows that en-
gineering teachers number in-
to the thousands. Inevitably,
this great body of educators
will sooner or later be com-
pletely replaced by new men;
inevitably, replacements are to
be drawn from the ranks of engineer graduates. If
it is proper to try to inform seniors about engineer-
ing practice, it is proper to inform them about engi-
neering teaching, for practice and teaching ulti-
mately recruit from the same source of supply. Yet
this writer cannot remember ever having seen a
A. D. MOORE
at any rate, the writer is very
grateful for an opportunity to
try in some measure to stop
the gap.
The senior who may private-
ly be contemplating a teaching
career is already acquainted
with some of the externals. He
has sat in classes a great many
times, and has seen and heard
a considerable number of in-
structors in action. He knows
how long the school terms are,
and he knows the length of va-
cations down to the minute.
Beyond this, his information is
likely to be quite sketchy.
There is an impression
abroad that teaching amounts
to doing the same old thing
year after year. For the teach-
er who succeeds, there is little
truth in the impression. Teach-
ing school is a seasonal occu-
pation. If there were any mo-
notony in teaching the same course two semesters
in succession, it would be largely relieved by the
change of weather alone, with its attendant changes
in outside interests. Then there is the experience of
meeting new classes. My hat is off to the instructor
so seasoned that he can face a new class for the

first time without experiencing a thrill of expect-
ancy, or some actual stage fright.
Concerning the subject-matter to be handled,
teaching certainly is not repetition. The successful
teacher finds it impossible to teach the same course
in the same way twice. He is bound to try new
things in new ways. He is likely to be so charged
with ideas on how to better his methods at the end
of a semester, that he is anxious for the next to
begin; and his continual regret
is that he has not the time to
work out as far as he would
like to, the ideas he wants to
put into effect. This brings us
easily to a consideration of the
kind of mentality one should
bring to a teaching position.
The impression perhaps ex-
ists, among students at least,
that engineering teachers are
very wise creatures, with brain
development far beyond that
of ordinary mortals. In fair-
ness to my subject, it is my sad
duty to enter a denial. It isn't
so. More truthfully, it is sel-
dom so. The simple fact is
that nearly all engineering
teachers were once engineer-
ing seniors, and some of us were none too luminous
at that. Of course, a teacher must have sufficient
mental ability to master his section or sections of
the field,—but that requires no great brilliance. The
intelligence is required to find the right ways to
present a subject, once it is mastered. The mastery
of a good teaching technique requires a deal of com-
mon sense, a capacity for changing one's mind, and
a degree of elasticity not common to all professional
workers.
Of necessity, the young teacher takes up a job
where someone else left it. He knows little about
teaching, and the chances are that the job has him
cowed. He skates along, keeps his head well cov-
ered to avoid being noticed, and follows an outline
with great rigidity. In two or three years the
youngster begins to get some ideas of his own,—
often too many of them. But he gets them, and he
begins trying them out. Naturally, some work well,
and some do not; but it is by such experimenting
that progress is made.
A little later the young teacher becomes still
more daring. Besides modifying the way in which
he presents his outlined material he begins to ques-
tion the outline itself. Who wrote the outline, any-
way? Why is this point as important as it seems to
be? Why should that development be allotted a
\vhole week? He soon revises his whole plan for
presenting the subject. He revises it from then on
IN all the discussion and sug-
gestions of opportunities for
senior engineers a subject least
noticed despite its particular
noteworthiness is that of engi-
neering teaching. A. D. Moore,
Assistant Professor of Electri-
cal Engineering, is without
doubt, most thoroughly
schooled in this field. His own
experiences as well as his wide
acquaintance with those of oth-
ers makes him a recognized au-
thority. His thorough treat-
ment in this article of the pos-
sibilities of this field goes far
to remove the haze which has
surrounded it in the past.
—The Editor.
at least once a year. Change is stimulating, hence
justified for its own sake; but better still, it some-
times happens that proper changes based on experi-
ence with the subject return rich benefits. Elimi-
nation of dead spots and bad instructional methods
may double the progress made by a class in a se-
mester, the work at the same time being made
much more interesting.
Mentally, then, the successful engineering teacher
must be a master of his sub-
ject, but in addition, he must
have a resiliency that permits,
welcomes, and compels change.
He has the temerity to doubt
his own and other teachers' pet
methods, and a capacity for
adapting or devising new vehi-
cles for old materials of in-
structions; and he is keen
enough to judge results ob-
tained, whether they weigh for
or against the innovation.
The personality of a good
engineering teacher is not a
matter for exact specification.
One seems to find great divers-
ity of personality in any fair-
sized group of successful teach-
ers. It is probable that such a
judgment is based on externals rather than on any
careful inspection of fundamental make-up. There
are certain basic requirements common through-
out, no matter how other traits may vary. No man
can be' a fine teacher of engineering and not have
the confidence and respect of his students. Intel-
lectual honesty, intensity of purpose, belief in the
value of the profession, and confidence in one's
ability to teach,—these are common and absolutely
essential qualities.
A sense of fair play, and the absence of the taint
of suspicious cynicism are equally important.
Whatever the reasons may be, it is certainly true
that no schools or colleges can display a finer body
of self-respecting students than can our engineering
colleges. Such men react splendidly to courteous
treatment and fair play; they are also quick to re-
sent the opposite. The man who would teach engi-
neering well must have more than an impersonal
viewpoint on such matters. Unless his reactions art-
positive and healthy, he will not get far with his
students.
Teaching engineering is not a bossing job. A
boss hands, out orders, and penalizes for disobedi-
ence. Bossing has its valuable uses, but with nearly

TURBINE ELECTRIC DRIVES FOR PASSENGER
VESSELS
Bv K. G. DUDLEY. '18*
TURBINE electric drive for ship propulsion,
although an innovation for large passenger
vessels, is not an experiment in view of its
extensive adoption by the capital ships of our Navy.
Since the first application of electric drive on the
United States Collier. "Jupiter," the Government
quickly realized its vast possibilities and today, the
largest and most
efficient of our
m e n-o f-w a r are
propelled by elec-
tricity. Notable
among these are
the airplane car-
riers, U. S. S. Sara-
toga and U. S. S.
Lexington, each of
which is equipped
with turbine - gen-
erator capacity of
180,000 shaft horse-
power, enabling
the vessel to attain
a speed of 34 knots
per hour.
Electrification has
made tremendous
strides in the cen-
tral station and in-
dustrial fields. The latest to realize its great pos-
sibilities is the shipping industry, which today
presents an unlimited field for the application
of electric ship propulsion. Just how soon electric-
ity will take its place on the sea will depend upon
the open-mindedness with which the idea is re-
ceived; the competitive angle of the situation, and
the demand of the traveling public.
The S. S. "California." which was recently placed
in service on the New York to San Francisco run,
via the Panama Canal route, holds the distinction of
being the largest passenger vessel ever built in an
American shipyard, and also of being the first large
electrically-propelled merchant vessel in the world.
This vessel is a notable addition to our merchant
marine and sets a precedent in marine engineering
•Mr. Dudley's experiences in marine work have been many
and varied. In 1917 he enlisted in the U. S. Navy, where he
spent several months in training, after which he was sent to
the V. S. Navy Steam KiiRineering School at Stevens Institute,
from which he graduated with commission as ensign. He is
now with the General Electric Company at Schenectady and is
at present located in the turbine department.

design. The service records of this vessel are being
closely watched by all of the large ship owners,
both here and abroad, and its success is bound to
give that confidence which is needed for the adop-
tion of turbine-electric drive to the large, high-
powered ocean greyhounds, which ply the North
Atlantic. In view of the remarkable first round trip
of the "California,"
and the unstinted
praise of its pass-
engers for the thor-
ough enjoyment of
sea travel on a
noiseless and vi-
brationless ship, it
is safe to predict
that similar ships
on the North At-
lantic run would
do much to add to
the popularity of
sea travel and add
an important link
to the American
merchant marine.
As the features
embodied in the de-
sign and construc-
tion of fast Army
pursuit planes differ from those used for commercial
passenger carrying service, so does the application
of turbine-electric drive for the capital ships of the
U. S. Navy differ from those used aboard merchant
marine vessels. On naval vessels great stress is laid
upon high overload capacities, high economy at low
cruising speeds, as well as the maximum inter-
changeability of the generating equipment.
The speed of an ocean liner is more nearly con-
stant, and neither maximum high overload capacity,
nor high economy at low cruising speeds is of pri-
mary importance. Instead of the induction-motor
type of drive, the merchant vessels permit the use
of the synchronous motor with a fixed speed ratio
between the turbine and the propeller. This type
of motor is lighter in construction, and as it oper-
ates at unity power-factor, it minimizes the KVA
capacity, thereby reducing the size of the gener-
ating equipment required.
The power-generating equipment for a passen-
ger liner is quite similar to that installed in an up-

to-date central station. It lends itself to the appli-
cation of the same economic measures, such as high-
temperature steam, as well as multiple-stage bleed-
ing for feed water heating. The turbine can be
designed for a speed that will give maximum effi-
ciency without reference to the propeller speed, and
since reversing of the ship is accomplished by re-
versing the driving motors only, without reference
to the generator, the turbine operates in one direc-
tion only. This simplifies its design, eliminates the
need for a reversing element, and makes for a com-
pact, sturdy construction. .
Marine turbines are designed with a variable-
speed governor and provided with hand valves
through which steam is admitted to different seg-
MAIN PROPULSION CONTROL BOARD OF
S. S. CALIFORNIA
ments of the first stage nozzle. The turbine speed
is thereby controlled by a combination setting of
the operating governor and the hand valves.
I'nder ordniary conditions of operation, the oper-
ating governor is set slightly above the setting re-
quired for a given speed. The hand valves are then
opened until the speed of the turbine reaches the
desired speed. In the case of a storm at sea, the pro-
pellers tend to emerge, resulting in a corresponding
tendency for the turbines to speed up through loss
in load. The operating governor now comes into
play and prevents the turbine from racing. When
the propellers become completely submerged again,
there is a sudden demand for steam but the setting
of the hand valves prevents large surges of steam
being drawn from the boilers. This eliminates what
normally would result in the so-called boiler prim-
ing.
Since only an electrical connection exists between
the generating units and the driving motors, each
turbine can be suitably located in the engine room
irrespective of the location of the propeller shafts.
This permits the turbine to be installed in a sim-
ple manner directly above the condenser with down-
ward exhaust.
Because ships differ in their power requirements
and their number of propellers, slight design changes
are necessary, but the minor details of electric drive
and the fundamental or underlying principles arc
much the same.
The description of the electrical equipment on the
S. S. "California," which follows, is therefore, of
interest to students in marine engineering, as it
may be said to be tvpical of what would be appli-
cable to passenger vessels of much higher power.
The power equipment on the airplane carriers
"Saratoga" and "Lexington" is rated 180,000 shaft
hp., and several passenger liners de-luxe are now
under consideration, both here and abroad, with
propelling equipment capable of furnishing up to
200,000 shaft hp.
Turbine generating equipments with even a high-
er capacity are now being built for central station
practice and no doubt some day we shall see some-
what similar equipments applied to ships. Elec-
trically, it is possible to convey large powers, seem-
ingly without limit and without interposing mechan-
ical parts such as gearing that is subject to wear.
Electrical Equipment Installed on S. S.
"California"
The S. S. "California," being the first large, elec-
trically propelled passenger vessel, and so much de-
pending upon its successful and economic opera-
tion, every effort was made by 1,-,th the shipbuild-
ers and the manufacturer of the electrical propel-
ling equipment to build to the finest standards of
design and workmanship.
The turbine rotor was milled from a solid steel
forging with the exception of the first stage wheel,
which was shrunk on the shaft. The turbine blad-
ing is of non-corrodible, high-tensile steel. A modifi-
cation of this construction was used in the building
of three high-pressure turbine units now in success-
ful service in central station plants, in which the
initial steam pressure is 1200 pounds per square
inch. The factors of safety are, therefore, extreme-
ly high for the operating conditions that exist aboard
ship. The combined efficiency of the turbine, gen-
erator, and propelling motor, exclusive of excita-
tion, is above 72r/c, based on the Rankine cycle.
Should higher superheat be employed or the tur-
bine size be increased, a still higher efficiency could
be obtained.
Electrically driven vessels are noted for their
rapid manoeuvering qualities: and because of the
availability of full-power reversing, the ship's move-
ment can be controlled much more effectively than
with other types of drive.
The operation of an electrically driven vessel is
quite simple. Two control levers are used, one for
opening and closing the generator field circuit and
one for changing the set-up of the main line contac-
tors. These levers are so interlocked that the main
line contactors cannot be manipulated except when


Page 9

the field lever is in the "off" position. In start-
ing, the turbine speed lever is set for approximately
one-quarter speed. The main line control lever is
moved forward or hack to the "ahead" or "re-
verse" position as desired. The held lever is then
pushed forward, enabling current to be supplied to
the generator field circuit. For starting, the syn-
chronous motor has a high-resistance squirrel-cage

induction-motor winding, located in the pole pieces
of the motor. The field lever has three functions—
first, it places double excitation on the generator
during the time when the motor is being brought
up to speed; second, it applies normal excitation to
the rotor of the synchronous motor; and third, it
reduces the excitation to normal on the generator.
The time required to bring the motor into step is
but a few seconds. After the motor is in step, the
turbine speed is increased to that desired.
Mounted on a panel on the operating platform
are all the essential gauges and instruments re-
quired by the operating engineer for the proper
performance of the vessel. The meters consist of
ammeters, voltmeters, and wattmeters for the main
line circuit, and ammeters for both the generator
and motor field circuits. Pressure gauges, vacuum
gauges, revolution indicators, and counters are also
mounted on the same panel. A constant check of
the operation can, therefore, be constantly main-
tained. This ability to visualize constantly the op-
eration of the machinery at all times is of the ut-
most importance.
The power readings serve as a check on the pro-
pellers, and any differences in their characteristics
are readily discernible. So sensitive to small power
changes are the line ammeters, even during a pro-
peller revolution, that faulty operation is quickly
detected.
The power expenditure at a given r. p. m. gives
the torque characteristics on the propeller; and thus
its performance at varying drafts and weather con-
ditions, even to the effect of a dirty hull, may be
studied. This information likewise shows the pow-
er absorption by the propellers during manoeuver-
ing and turning of the vessel.
The over-all economy of a high-powered passen-
ger vessel depends .equally as much upon the ef-
ficiency of the auxiliary apparatus as it does upon
the main propelling equipment. On the "Califor-
nia." the auxiliaries are almost completely electri-
fied and four 5(X)-Kw. turbine-driven direct-current
generating units are installed to furnish power for
this purpose.
The entire refrigerating equipment, the main and
auxiliary circulating and condenser pumps, the
ship's ventilating fans, sanitary pumps, and numer-
ous other auxiliaries situated below deck are com-
pletely electrified. The staterooms are electrically
heated and all the galley ranges and bake ovens are
of the electric type.
The auxiliaries situated above deck, with the ex-
ception of the anchor windlass, are also electric.
The cargo winches are especially designed for
high-speed continuous service.
The S. S. "California" is probably the most eco-
nomical steam vessel of her class afloat today. The
fuel consumption is said to be less than 0.8 pounds
of oil per shaft horsepower hour. A sister vessel
is now being built at the yard of the Newport News
Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company at Newport
News. Va., which is a duplicate of the "California"
except as to the steam conditions, which have been
slightly increased to give an expected increase in
efficiencv of 5/«. Four additional vessels of the

PNEUMATIC TOOLS
By EDWARD R. NELL, '29E
A GREAT misconception is generally prevalent
in engineering circles regarding the efficiency
and versatility of compressed air as a medi-
um of power transmission, when compared with
steam and electricity. The general impression pre-
vails that compressed air is a very costly and waste-
ful medium. From a purely theoretical consider-
ation of heat units, and especial!}' in the case of
large power units, this is quite
true. However in the use of
compressed air in pneumatic
tools there are many important
factors, other than actual ther-
mal efficiency, which must be
given careful consideration be-
fore a true value of efficiency
in "cost for work done" can be
obtained.
The usual question of a per-
son who is not well acquainted
with the operation of pneumat-
ic tools is, "Why is steam not
used directly in the tools, since,
in most cases, it is necessary
to first make steam, and then
use the power in the steam to
compress air; why lose, say,
seventy-five per cent of the to-
tal heat units in steam in com-
pressing air, and then get only ten to twenty per
cent of the available power in the air delivered as
useful work from the tools?"
Percussive pneumatic tools, with the exception
of the valveless type, do not have a cut-off, and the
exhaust pressure is high. This fact, that most pneu-
matic tools do not run expansively to any appreci-
able extent, contributes greatly to their low thermal
efficiency. But, since it is almost always essential
to deliver a large amount of power as useful work
from the tool, with a minimum number of pounds
weight per horse power, any attempt to approach
the efficiency of a good steam engine is distinctly
handicapped. In addition, since pneumatic tools
are usually used at an appreciable distance from
the source of power, it is impracticable to prevent
heat and condensation losses, both in the pipe line,
and in the tool itself. These losses are so great in
the cases where steam is used instead of air as
to be almost prohibitive. Steam also experiences
considerable resistance in passing the moving parts
and parts of the tools.
To secure high speed of the moving parts in a
PNEUMATIC tools have
always been a strange sub-
ject to most engineers. This
lack of familiarity has given
rise to many false ideas regard-
ing their operation and con-
struction. In this article the
author has endeavored to give
definite information regarding
the efficiency, design, manufac-
ture, and operation of the most
common types of pneumatic
tools. All the material was ob-
tained by an actual visit to the
Detroit plant of the Chicago
Pneumatic Tool Co., and
through consultation with the
engineers at the plant.—The

reciprocating percussive tool, it is necessary that
a cushioning effect be produced by the power me-
dium when the piston reaches the end of its
stroke. Air adapts itself readily to this function,
whereas steam condenses on opening the exhaust
port, and no cushion is available. In actual prac-
tice it is found that the losses incurred in the use
of steam are so great, when compared to those of
air, that the same machine, op-
erating under the same condi-
tions of initial pressure and ex-
haust, will deliver much more
power when air is used, in fact,
the ratio is nearly two to one.
There are, many other disad-
vantages in using steam direct-
ly—since, as a rule, pneumatic
tools are hand operated, the
high temperature of steam
makes them uncomforatble to
handle. Many tools, such as
rock drills, are required to blow
cuttings from the bottom of
deep holes of small diameter,
through a quarter inch
hole in a long drill steel. This
operation is very efficiently ac-
complished with air, but is
very difficult with steam on
account of condensation in the long, cold holes.
Due to lack of cushioning, in the case of steam, the
tool becomes "rough" and disagreeable to hold, and
high maintenance costs are incurred on account of
excessive breakage of parts.
Electricity, while it is a much more efficient
means of power transmission than compressed air,
loses this advantage in the comparatively large
weight per horsepower of electric machinery. Since
most pneumatic tools are hand operated, and must
be easily moved, the great weight of electric tools
is a handicap which almost prohibits their use. For
example, a compressed air operated rock drill made
by the Chicago Pneumatic Tool Company which
weighs 140 pounds, actually delivers two and one-
half horse power on the end of the drill steel for
useful work, while running on air at 80 pounds
gauge pressure. An electric drill to do the same
work and designed along the most efficient lines
would weigh at least 300 pounds, and would be
too heavy and cumbersome to operate expeditiously,
and in addition to this, an air jet with which to
clean out the rock cuttings would be lacking.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Electric rock-drilling machines have been placed
on the market at various times, and while some were
well designed, they were found to be too slow in
drilling, too heavy, and high in maintenance cost
on account of excessive breakage of parts. The in-
stallation of electric power transmission lines in a
mine is a difficult task. The water
and moisture which are always
present make effective insulation
almost impossible, and the accom-
panying power losses and hazards
to the well being of workmen must
not be lightly considered.
Hammer tools employing the
principles of the internal combus-
tion engine have been made and
put in operation at frequent inter-
vals, but without lasting success.
The chief objection to their use, as
in the case of electric tools, is ex-
cessive weight per horse power de-
livered on the work tool. Tools of
this type require fragile parts
which will not stand up under the
vibration which is inseparable to a
machine having a free reciprocat-
ing percussive piston or hammer. The exhaust
gases from a combustion tool are poisonous, and
where many workmen are together, either in the
open or underground, this is a hazard to their well

cost of operation. It is obvious, for example, in the
case of a rock drill used underground, that if the
total cost of compressed air for an eight-hour shift
is, say, 25 cents, and the balance of the total cost
for the shift is, say, $24.75, a saving of half the
power cost, or \2l/z cents amounts to only one per
cent of the total cost for the shift.
In the case of tools where power
is applied to the substance being
worked in a purely rotary manner,
without percussive hammer blows,
the advantages of compressed air.
are not so great, and for this rea-
son, many rotary electric tools are
in use. However, even here the air
tool has the advantage of great
power and high starting torque
with light weight.
Pneumatic tools, as a whole, dif-
fer greatly in design and use. Two
distinct types are noticeable, the
reciprocating percussive hammer
type, and the rotary reciprocating
piston type. Air turbines are com-
paratively few in number.
The reciprocating percussive
hammer tool consists essentially of a piston or ham-
mer and some means to control the admission and
exhaust of air to and from the cylinder in which the
piston moves back and forth. Percussive tools are
being. The exhaust air from pneumatic tools has of two types, the valve and the valveless. In the
considerable value as ventilation in underground
workings.
At the present time, particularly for reciprocat-
i n g hammer per-
cussive tools, the
best proof that
compressed a i r is
the most efficient
in overall cost for
work done, lies in
the fact that while
many steam, elec-
tric, and internal
combustion tools
have been placed
on the market from
time to time, of
proper principle
and design, tools
operated b y com-
pressed air are
used almost exclusively. In the case of tools that
are hand held and hand operated, where the cost of
the power used is a small percentage of the total
cost, it is readily seen that cutting the cost of the
power used does not materially affect the overall
valveless tools the piston is so constructed that it
acts as a valve, but it allows the tool to run semi-
expansively.
In the valve type
tools the valve usu-
ally consists of a
spool shaped piece
with a number of
deep circular
grooves cut in it,
and slides back and
forth in a short
valve chest. It
works somewhat
on the principle of
the steam engine
D-slide valve. It is
interesting to note
that these valves
operate entirely
free from the pis-
ton, air is the motive medium for the valve as well
as the piston. This feature contributes greatly to
the difficulties encountered in pneumatic tool de-
sign.

the drill steel to the end of this hole, to clean out

Such types as drill steels, rivet sets, chipping blades,
and caulking chisels are the more common.
Theoretically, the lighter the piston the more rap-
idly it can be reciprocated with the same impelling
force, which allows more blows of the same energy
to be struck in a given length of time. This ac-
counts for the marked increase in horse power de-
livered and work done with the modern reciprocat-
ing percussive tools. Riveting and chipping ham-
mers have employed this "piston hammer principle"
since the beginning.
In rock drills these secondary pieces or work tools
are given a rotary motion in addition to hammer
blows. The mechanism which rotates them con-
sists usually of a ratchet and pawls with a rifling
arrangement, on the front of the piston or a rifle bar
(a separate piece) in rear of piston. Some machines
employ an independent motor for rotating the work
tool. Ko rotating

exclusively in mines and quarries.

CROSSING THE ATLANTIC IN FOUR DAYS
By HERBERT C. SADLER*
Professor of Nural Architecture and Marine Engineering
THE Atlantic Ocean, forming the connecting
link between the United States and Europe,
has been perhaps the most important re-
gion of the world so far as the development of the
fast type of vessel is concerned.
In the early days of the sailing ship, the fast
American clipper easily held its own, but with the
development of the iron, and latterly, the steel
s t e a mship, our
merchant marine
gradually d w i n-
dled, largely on
account of our in-
ability to compete
with the foreigner.
From the latter
part of the last
century there has
been a steady de-
velopment, both in
size and speed, of
the passenger lin-
ers engaged in
this trade. The
s tep s have been
slow but sure,
from vessels of three to four hundred feet in length,
and speeds of fifteen knots, until today we have ves-
sels approaching one thousand feet in length, and
speeds of the order of twenty-five knots.
In this development the United States has played
little or no part, but since the Great War, which
showed us our lamentable weakness in merchant
ships, the consciousness of the nation has been
aroused to the absolute necessity of an adequate
merchant marine, if we are to hold our own in the
trade of the world. The American principle of a
protective tariff, together with the ensuing higher
cost of wages and living, has acted as a deterrent
when it comes to competition with foreign ships, in
that our first costs and running expenses are nat-
urally higher.
There is, however, a strong feeling at the pres-
ent time, that the same principles which have been
used to foster all our industries, should be applied
to the merchant marine. There are now before
Congress certain bills which have for their object

the main idea of overcoming our present handicap
and the encouragement to private enterprise to en-
enter this field.
Certain men who are vitally interested in this
matter, have recently approached the question of
the possibilities of a fast Atlantic service, from what
might be called fundamental transportation ques-
tions rather than from the point of view of doing
just a little better
than the present-
d a y in e t h o d s.
Speed is one of
the essentials of
our modern civili-
zation, and it is
no use denying the
fact or wasting
time on useless re-
grets for the "good
old days." Recent
developments i n
engineering, and
n o t a b 1 y in air
transport a-
tion have enabled
us to t h i n k in
higher terms so far as speed is concerned. While
the future may develop long distance high speed air
transportation over the Atlantic, it does not at
present offer a practical solution. A combination of
fast ship with a comparatively short airplane run at
each end does, however, suggest possibilities.
It is with this principle in view that recent de-
signs have been presented to the shipping board, as
a solution for a high speed mail and passenger serv-
ice. To make it worth while, and after a very care-
ful survey of all questions involved, it was decided
that the ships should be capable of crossing the
Atlantic from port to port in four days, and that
they should be fitted with an airplane landing deck
and facilities for carrying airplanes. By having a
high speed airplane leave several hours after the
ship and overtake her. and at the other end of the
voyage, by sending off an airplane before the ship
reaches her dock, a still further amount of time for
the transit of mails can be saved; thereby reduc-
ing the time of the passage to from three to three
and one-half days. The average sea speed of the
vessels will have to be over thirty-three knots or,

THE ANTIQUITY OF RECENT INDENTIONS
By JOHN S. WORLEY
Profesior of Transportation
TO the man in the street, the invention of all
modern improvements dates with the dawn or
sunrise (1800-1900) of our mechanical age.
The steamboat Clermont was built in 1807; the
Stockton and Darlington Railw-ay was opened in
1825 ; the construction on the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Rail-
road began July 4, 1828; the Brooklyn bridge was

particular device used.
A most superficial search into the records and
literature of the past—no extensive research has
been undertaken to date—reveals the most astound-
ing facts regarding earlier concepts and uses of
these devices of comparatively recent development.
We do not know the date when paved roads were
first constructed, but just at the edge of the an-
cient city of Conosus can be seen a paved road built
about 1500 B. C. Today this road is in such a
condition an automobile can be safely driven there-
over at a rapid rate of speed. The Roman Empire
began the construction of its great system of paved
roads about 200 B. C. When completed about 400
A. I), they reached from Rome to every province
and principality of the Roman Empire. The total
mileage has been estimated at a little less than
150,000 miles. The construction work was so well
done that many of the bridges, tunnels, and via-
ducts are still intact, as is also some of the road
surface.
The movement of boats by means other than sails
or oars is as old as our present era. It is well au-
thenticated that the Romans had paddle wheels
which through a train of gears registered the dis-
tance traveled. It seems inconceivable that these
wheels were not used for propulsion. Claudius Can-

dex, a Roman consul, in the year of 264 B. C., was
transported into Sicily by a boat propelled by paddle-
wheels moved by oxen. We have a book and a pic-
ture of such a boat which was in use in 1587.
A work published in Spain early in the nineteenth
century told of a
steamboat which
was operated in 1543
by one Balasco de
Garay, a sea captain.
In order to carry on
this experiment the
book recites how Ba-
lasco de Garay ob-
tained from the king
of Spain a subsidy.
The Transportation
Library recently ac-
quired the original
manuscript letter of
Balasco de Garay to
the king of Spain
asking for this sub-
sidy. Jonathan Hulls
in 1737, seventy
years before Fulton
built the Clormont,
issued a pamphlet
with a drawing of a
steam tug boat to be
used in towing sail-
ing vessels into and
out of harbours.1
The idea of the au-
tomobile was not
new when Henry
Ford built his first
car. We have copies
of eleven automotive pictures which .were made in
1516. John Wilkins (1617-1672) was an English
divine and author of a number of books among
which is one, Mathematical Magic.1 One chapter
he devotes to the possibilities of a chariot being
propelled by four wind vanes and a train of gears.
The advantage of such a vehicle was extolled in
considerable length for "what could be more de-
lightful or better husbandry, than (sic) to make
use of the wind (which costs nothing, and eats
nothing) instead of horses."
But Bishop Wilkinson was not satisfied to dis-
cuss automotive vehicles. He also devotes a chap-
ter "Concerning the possibility of framing an Ark
for submarine navigations. The difficulties and
conveniences of such a contrivance." As to the
many advantages and conveniences of such a con-
trivance he says:
"1. 'Tis private; a man may thus goe to any
coast of the world invisibly, without being discov-

"2. 'Tis safe; from the uncertainty of Tides, and
the violence of Tempests, which doe never move
the sea above five or six paces deep. From Pirates
and Robbers which do so infest other voyages; from
ice and great frosts,
which doe so much

ages towards the
Poles.
"3. It may be of
very great advantage

emies, who by this
means may be un-
dermined in the wat-
er and blown up.
"4. It may be of

supplies: and so like-
wise for the surpris-
all of any place that
is accessible by wat-
er.
"5. It may be of
unspeakable benefit
for submarine exper-
iments and discover-
ies."
At the time of
Bishop Wilkins, Cor-
nelius D r e b 1 e, an
English man had
constructed such a
vessel. In Holland a similar vessel had been con-
structed, a contemporary picture of which is still
extant.1
We cannot pass by submarine navigation without
calling attention that in 1800 in France Robert
Fulton built a submarine which with a crew of
24 men was successfully operated. Fulton was able
to submerge the boat or bring it to the surface at
will. He could navigate under water and could
remain submerged until the air was exhausted from
within the boat.
Bishop Wilkins was not content to confine his
book to automobiles and submarines but felt called
upon to devote two chapters, "Concerning the Art
of Flying, the several ways whereby it hath been or
may be attempted." It was his thought that it was
possible to construct "a flying chariot, which may
be so contrived as to carry a man within: though
the strength of a spring might perhaps be service-

INDUSTRIES OF MICHIGAN-
PORTLAND CEMENT
By DONAL HAMILTON RAINES
VIII
IT is almost impossible to write of any Ameri-
can industry without having recourse to the
phraseology of the sensational newspaper and
tabulations of figures startling in their revelations.
Such handling of material is not deliberate but in-
evitable because of the fashion in which various
enterprises have grown from small beginnings to
the colossal proportions of the present day within
a comparatively short span of years, and in no field
is this more strikingly true than in that of portland
cement, unquestionably the greatest single factor
in this age of rapid and enduring construction, both
in buildings and the vast network of highways made
necessary by the automobile.
Only a century has passed since the discovery of
portland cement; only half that time since its first
manufacture in this country. Coupling this state-
ment with the present status of the industry, it is
evident that the history of the intervening years
must be a story of swift progress and amazing
growth.
In the year 1824 an Englishman, Joseph Aspdin,
perfected the process of manufacturing the material
which he called portland cement, after researches
extending over a period of some fourteen years. He
named his product because of its resemblance to a
hard, gray rock found on the Isle of Portland off
the south coast of England.
Thanks to the thorough nature of Aspdin's orig-
inal experiments, portland cement was a substance
of thoroughly dependable nature from the first day
of its appearance, its merits were soon demonstrat-
ed and its use began to spread through Europe be-
fore the middle of the nineteenth century, some ex-
port to the United States beginning at this time.
About 1872, fifty years after its first importation
from Europe, portland cement was manufactured on
this side of the Atlantic, one mill being established
in Pennsylvania and the second in Indiana.
In no way can the growth of the industry in
America be indicated than by the following table
showing the average annual production in sacks
from 1872 to 1922.
Year Sacks
1872 (to 1878. average) 36,000
1882 340.000
1892 2,188,000
1902 68,922,000
1912 329.752,384
1922 452,000.000
The raw materials required for the manufacture
of portland cement—-limestone, clay and gypsum—
being widely distributed in this country, cement
plants came into existence in almost every part of
the country where, or near where, these substances
were easily available, so that there has been no con-
spicuous centralization of the industry, although
naturally cement plants are more numerous in those

sections of the country where the deposits of the
raw materials are richest and most easily worked.
Michigan, thanks to extensive deposits of marl
and to the initiative of the pioneers in cement man-
ufacture, has ranked high in pnrtland cement pro-
posits of raw materials makes it possible for all of
these mills to secure their materials from local
sources. About ten per cent of the portland ce-
ment manufactured in Michigan is produced from
marl and clay. Two mills use industrial by-prod-

duction from the outset. Of the 120 cement plants
in operation in the United States at the present
time, 15 are in Michigan. This number in a sin-
gle state is surpassed only by Pennsylvania, which
has 24 mills within its borders. \\ hile Michigan
does not stand first in the production of cement, it
occupies what might be called a "key position" in
the field. This position is recognized by the United
States Bureau of Mines, which divides the entire
countrv into 12 major districts in its compilation of
statistics on the production of cement, and Michi-
gan forms one of these districts. Only three other
states, New York, Texas and California, are so rec-
ognized in these official compilations, and of the
three only California surpasses Michigan in the vol-
ume of cement produced and shipped.
Some years ago the leaders in the industry formed
what is called the Portland Cement Association,
which has been instrumental in standardizing the
manufacture of cement throughout the country and
making it possible for the builder or highway en-
gineer to depend absolutely on the uniform nature
of his material no matter from what section of the
country it has come. The association maintains 200
field engineers in different parts of the country, and,
still more important, it has so completely standard-
ized the manufacture of cement in all American
mills that every sack turned out conforms to the
very exacting specifications required by the Ameri-
can Society for Testing Materials and the United
States Government.
The fifteen mills in Michigan are well distributed
throughout the state, being located as far north as
Petoskey and as far south as the Indiana border,
while they stretch from Newaygo on the west to
Port Huron on the east. The location of the de-
ucts. The rest of the cement is made from lime-
stone and shale. But whatever process of manu-
facture is employed in the individual mill, the prod-
uct must conform to the rigid standards mentioned
above.
The conformation of all the cement manufac-
tured in the country to these standards has of course
worked an inestimable industrial benefit. Before
this was brought about through the Portland Ce^
ment Association, the individual user of cement
could only be sure of the quality of the material
he was using through actual experiment. Now he
knows absolutely that, when made into concrete,
the cement he is using will develop a certain mini-
mum of strength at the end of a given period of
time.
Michigan has been peculiarly fortunate in the
matter of natural resources, as the deposits of clay,
marl, limestone and shale within the borders of the
state have made it possible for Michigan cement
makers to conform to the required specifications
without the expense of importing any of the raw
materials from outside. Moreover, the richness of
her deposits have been more than sufficient for
the state's needs, and raw materials are shipped
from Michigan to cement plants in Wisconsin, In-
diana, Ohio and New York.
While there have naturally been great and con-
stant improvements made in the various processes
of manufacture, there has been no basic alteration
in the process discovered by Aspdin more than a
hundred years ago.
After it has been brought from the quarry, the
stone is dumped into the jaws of huge crushers,
which reduce it to bits the size of a walnut and
smaller. From the crushers it passes on to the

rotary ball mills, long steel cylinders filled with
heavy steel balls which roll and strike against each
other as the cylinder is turned, reducing the crushed
stone to particles as fine as grains of sand. From
the ball mills the sand-like material is carried to
other mills where the required amount of clay is
added, together with the necessary amount of
Some very interesting figures estimating the uses
to which different proportions of the portland ce-
ment manufactured in this country is put, have
been issued by the Portland Cement Association.
They are roughly as follows:
One-fifth of the total goes to road building. It
is estimated that about 6000 miles of paved high-

water, and this compound is ground and reground
until it is reduced to a "slurry" as fine as flour paste.
This "slurry," a semi-liquid material, is carried
from the mills and stored in huge silos, from which
it is pumped by pressure to the rotary kilns, where
it is burned at temperatures ranging from 2500 to
3000 degrees Fahrenheit. These rotary kilns, in
mills of the present day, vary from 6 to 11 feet in
width and from 60 to 200 feet in length.
The kilns turn on roller bearings, making three-
fourths of a turn per minute, and are tilted three-
quarters of an inch for each foot of length, so that
the slurry, which is fed into them at the upper end,
works slowly toward the lower. The temperature
at the upper end is about 1000 degrees Fahrenheit,
and inereases to one of 3000 degrees at the lower
end, a terrific heat maintained by a constant mass
of flame coming from pulverized coal and blown
into the kiln under pressure through an eighth-inch
jet. By the time the slurry has reached the lower
end of the kiln it has been thoroughly roasted, has
undergone a chemical change and has been formed
into very hard clinker-balls varying in size from
that of a pea to a walnut.
From the kilns a constant stream of these clinker-
balls falls into buckets of water, and the balls are
slaked into very fine particles, and these are car-
ried to the clinker storage where it is aged, the
period ranging from several weeks to several
months.
The clinker goes next to the finishing mills, where
it is mixed with the proper amount of gypsum, then
ground and pulverized until it is reduced to a pow-
der much finer than flour. It is then carried into
storage silos, holding more than 400,000 sacks, and
is then ready for the market.
ways are being built every year, and the figure is
certain to increase steadily.
One-fifth is used by the farmers of the nation in
the construction of houses, barns, silos, fence posts,
stock house floors, watering troughs, cribs, bins, cel-
lars, wells and walks.
Another fifth is used by the builders of bridges,
dams, aqueducts, culverts, houses, offices and fac-
tory buildings.
A tenth is used by the railroads in the construc-
tion of bridges, culverts, platforms, ties, etc.
The remaining three-tenths of the annual pro-
duction of more than 400,000,000 sacks goes into an
almost unlimited number of uses including side-
walks, swimming pools, chimneys, flower pots and
decorative pottery, stadiums, bank vaults, curbing
and so on.
Nineteen twenty-seven was an outstanding vear
for the portland cement industry in Michigan. A
total of 13,712,000 barrels were shipped from manu-
facturers to dealers or users within this state. This
represented an increase in consumption of 14.7 per
cent over the previous year.
Last year saw the production of 13,959.000 barrels
by Michigan mills. Production increased 15.9 per
cent over 1926. These figures show two things:
first that the use of portland cement in Michigan
has taken a definite upward trend; second, that
production of this material is growing more rap-
idly than its uses.
One naturally asks: Are these conditions typi-
cal for those of the country as a whole? The an-
swer can be found in statistics compiled by the U.
S. Bureau of Mines. During 1927, 171,908,000 bar-
rels of portland cement were produced in the

WHAT CAN I PATENT?
By CARLOS G. STRATTON
SOONER or later every engineer is confronted
with the question as to what may be patented,
and so at least a speaking familiarity with the
subject is valuable to every technically trained man,
whether he be a civil, electrical, mining, mechan-
ical, or irrigation engineer.
While a patent is perhaps more difficult to pro-
cure at the present time than at any time in the
history of the country, because so many patents
have been granted previously, yet patents are un-
doubtedly worth more today than ever before! They
bring larger royalties and sell for higher prices
than at any time in the history of the world.
The answer, boiled down to an irreducible mini-
mum, is that any new and useful invention can be
protected by patent. The law of patents clusters
largely around these three words: "new," "useful,"
and "invention," and to understand them fully is to
know the fundamentals of patent law.
Of these three words, "invention" is by far the
most difficult to understand and perhaps the most
important. No satisfactory definition has ever been
framed for invention that will meet all cases, and
the clearest way of explaining what invention is, is
to give examples of what may be protected and
what not.
Inventions are of two kinds—basic and those that
are improvements over existing machines or proc-
esses. The basic invention is that which is first
in the field and which dominates the field, as Alex-
ander Graham Bell's invention of the telephone, the
carbon filament of Edison, or vulcanized rubber
of Goodyear.
A basic patent is much more valuable and is cor-
respondingly rarer and harder to obtain. The vast
majority of patents granted in the United States
today are on improvements. Some time ago an
ocean liner was crossing the Pacific from San Fran-
cisco to the East Indies. En route the propeller
struck a rock and distorted its shape, with the re-
sult that it propelled the ship several knots more
per hour with no change in the speed of the ship's
engine. This would be considered a patentable im-
provement, but it was not basic, for propellers were
old as means to propel steamships.
The discovery of a necessity or a desired func-
tion is not invention. For instance, it might be
seen that it would be advantageous to be able to
put chains on the tires of an automobile while it
is running. This idea as it stands cannot be pat-
ented. But let a man conceive and make a mechan-
ical device that will put chains on a car while it is
in motion and we have an invention. Such a de-
vice was patented in 1925 (by John T. Jinkens,
Patent No. 1561080, issued November 10, 1925).
Suppose the problem of making a device for put-
ting chains on a car while it is running is set before
a class of ten engineers. In all probability each of
the ten solutions would be different from the other
nine, and yet all ten would probably be patentable,
if they differed mechanically to a patentable ex-
tent. Tersely, it is the means to the end, not the
end itself, that can be patented.
Square Lawn Sprinkler
Moreover, it is the common experience of those
who have lawns to sprinkle that the ordinary
sprinkler sprays a round blanket of water, thus wet-
ting the sidewalk, street or wall of the house in
order that all the corners may be watered. If the
reader will lay down this magazine at this point
and figure out a means to sprinkle a square area,
he will have invented an article which, if new, can
be patented.
The means employed by one man to solve this
problem consisted of perforating the top of a
sprinkler with holes of different diameters. The
larger holes were so placed that they would pro-
vide the corners for a square blanket of water, and
between the larger- holes the perforations became in-
creasingly smaller, forming the sides of the square.
In operation this sprinkler will moisten a square
area, the size of the square depending upon the
force of the water that is turned on. This sprinkler
has been patented (by Henry M. Siemann, Patent
No. 1539331, issued May 26, 1925).
To the man who persists that there is nothing
new under the sun and that the Patent Office might
as well close, it may be suggested that putting old
elements together in new combinations is patent-
able. However, the combination must be more than
a mere aggregation or assemblage of parts. Ex-
emplifying this doctrine, a stove that contained
more good features than were ever before assem-
bled in one stove would not be patentable if all the
features were old and if they did not perform a
joint function, and if each improved part only did
what it had formerly done in other stoves.
But if a clock mechanism is operatively connect-
ed with the damper of the stove so as to open the
damper at a certain hour every morning, this would
be a patentable combination. (This was patented
by W. R. Larson, Patent No. 992011, issued May


A/ay, 1928
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
9, 1911.) The clock and the damper were both old,
but by putting them together this inventor obtained
a new result, differing. from the result of either
one without the other.
New Tree Not An Invention
Neither the discovery of a law of nature, nor
of a product of nntiire, is invention ; but means tak-
ing advantage of either may be patented, if new.
The law of gravity could not have been patented by
Newton, but he could have patented a machine to
take advantage of it. If a new species of pine tree
or a new variety of clay were discovered in some
remote region of the Rocky Mountains, neither
could be patented by itself.
A few years ago it was noticed that the hoofs of
certain range cattle were very smooth, whitened and
clean. Upon investigation a new variety of clay
called "Bentonite" was found, which had valuable
detergent or cleansing qualities. By mixing this
clay with a small amount of perfume and certain
other ingredients, a cream was produced that was
valuable to the feminine toilet, since it removed
freckles. Although the clay as found in nature was
not patentable, by mixing it with other ingredients
a patentable composition was obtained.
The commonest way of explaining what invention
is has been to explain what it is not. The follow-
ing paragraphs explain a few of the general rules
as to what is not invention.
A rule often overlooked is the one that finding a
new use for an old invention is not patentable. It
is well settled that an inventor is entitled to all of
the uses of his invention, known or unknown. That
is to say, if a man invents a basket for carrying ap-
ples, it is not invention to discover that it will also
carry potatoes. An invention of a hinge for a door
would be entitled to royalties from everyone who
used his hinge, whether it be on the door of an au-
tomobile, the lid of a box, or what not. But where
it requires as great inventive ability to find a new
use for an old object as it required to invent the
object originally, it may be patented.
Generally speaking, the substitution of materials,
as steel for iron, or metal for wood, is of itself not
invention, unless by the substitution new proper-
ties or uses of the article are.developed, or a new
mode of operation is produced.
Multiplication of parts is usually not invention.
Nor is omission of parts patentable where the re-
moval of the element also eliminates its function.
For instance, if five or three parts are used where
formerly only four were used, and the result is no
more than would be expected from the mere addi-
tion or subtraction of parts, this would not be in-
vention. For instance, a man could not get a pat-
ent on a hay rake if the only improvement he made
was to use less or more teeth on the rake.
Changes in form, proportions, or degree are gen-
erally not considered inventions, unless such changes
cause marked improvements over what has been
known before. The changing of the form of the
ship's propeller, as stated hereinbefore, would be
patentable, for it is a marked improvement. Gen-
erally, however, making a vacuum tube larger or
smaller, or making the grid larger and the plate
smaller, or vice versa, would probably not be pat-
entable, unless the result is found to be a tube
having distinct advantages over what has gone be-
fore.
Thousand Patents a Week
Coming to the second point in determining the
patentability of a given article, it must be new. In
the first place it must not have been previously pat-
ented. Over a million and a half patents have been
granted by the United States, so that the patents
that have been granted touching directly or indi-
rectly almost every subject now known to man.
However, there is not a single field in which
new and valuable improvements cannot be made.
As evidence of this, approximately one thousand
patents are granted by the United States Patent
Office every week!
When it is said that an invention must be new,
"new" has a technical meaning. It may have been
known or used in a foreign country and still be new
and patentable in the United States. But a world
traveler upon finding a Chinese using a certain
article, cannot bring it into this country and patent
it, even though it was unheard of here, for the man
who applies for a patent in the United States must
be the original inventor, or at least not get the in-
vention from someone else.
Prior public use or sale in the United States for
more than two years, or prior publication, will pre-
vent an inventor from patenting an article in this
country. This use, however, must not have been
accidental. If sulphur had been used in a com-
pound with rubber more than two years prior to
the Goodyear application, but the person did not
appreciate what he had done and could not repro-
duce it again, this would not have prevented Good-
year from getting a patent on his process. Like-
wise, it has been held by the courts of the United
States that unsuccessful experiments do not pre-
vent a subsequent inventor from obtaining a patent.
Many may experiment, but it is to the inventor who
is diligent and first reduces his invention to a prac-
tical application that a patent will be awarded.
Commercial success is some key to novelty of an
invention. If the public buys a new radio tube in
large quantities, bringing almost immediate success
to its manufacturer, and if the question of whether
or not the tube is new is about evenly balanced,
such success would be very persuasive that it is
new and would probably turn the scales to the side
of novelty because it appears to be something that


Page 21
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the public wanted and had been waiting for, and
therefore it contained new improvements and ad-
vantages over all other tubes.
Freckle Cream Patentable
It must not be thought, however, that machines
are the only things that may be patented. A new
composition of matter, such as the aforementioned
freckle cream, a new mixture of concrete, or a new
chemical compound, may be patented.
The so-called "patent medicine" is seldom pat-
ented, for the United States Patent Office refuses
to patent a medicine. Salves for external applica-
tion, and the like, are sometimes patentable, but
most internal medicines are not patentable. The
usual method pursued by owners of formulae for
protecting medicinal preparations is to keep the
formulae secret and register the trade marks in the
I'nited States and foreign countries, as, for exam-
ple, Tanlac, etc., etc.
A patent may be obtained on a new and orna-
mental design, as a design for a radio cabinet, a
tire tread, a lamp, or a ring. Even a football sta-
dium has been patented where its design is new.
A new article of manufacture may be patented,
such as a glove, a toothbrush, a golf ball, or a street
car transfer. (The Denver Tramway transfers are
patented.) The process of making a machine or
article such as a new method of treating low grade
ores, or a new chemical process, as making sugar,
may be patented, if new.

ENGINEERING TEACHING
(Continued from page 6)
material in a reasonably clear style, if the assign-
ments are fair, if the textbook is at least a sample
of what it ought to be,—then the students will get
the work out; an instructor can make no worse
mistake than to assume otherwise. There are some
students who, will not work, either under this pro-
gram, or under a program of compulsion. It is a
mistake to drive such men, for it means a waste of
energy. On the other hand, there are a very few
students, worth saving, who occasionally need stiff
sailing orders. At such times the good instructor
will rise to the occasion and a fine time will be had
by all.
A defect too frequently found in men who cannot
be rated as successful teachers, is an over-develop-
ment of the fine art of classroom sarcasm. A little
gentle irony now and then may help where nothing
else will; just occasionally, some real sarcasm may
turn out to be the only surgical tool usable on rare
and chronic cases. But a frequent resort to sar-
castic utterance is unpardonable. All this of course
sums itself up under the head of human decency,
courtesy, and fair play. The man who is too im-
patient to avoid biting sarcasm should not be teach-
ing; there are plenty of vacancies in the lion-taming
business.
The qualifications enumerated so far will easily
be seen to describe many men outside the profes-
sion of teaching as well as in it. Where, then, does
the difference come in? If ten men in the senior
class find themselves described above, are all ten
justified in thinking they could become good engi-
neering teachers? Hardly. According to the writ-
er's ideas, there is one more qualification that is
distinctive :•—a good teacher is one who likes to
teach. Before ever taking a teaching position, he
knows that he likes to teach. Those who like to
teach will understand this statement at once; others
can merely take it on faith. A young man who likes
to teach finds abundant opportunity to exercise his
talent. In college other students gravitate to him
with the tougher problems; they have found out,
first, that he usually can work things out where
they cannot; second, he is able to explain so that
they can understand; third, he appears to enjoy do-
ing it. And he knows that he likes to do it. He
knew it in high school, from the same experiences;
he knew it even in grade school. This man, who
likes to explain things, and does it well, is a born
teacher. He will be teaching all of his life, no mat-
ter where he is or what he is doing. One of the
problems of the engineering colleges is to get more
of his kind on the faculty.
An active engineering teacher leads a very full
life. The part of it most apparent to the student is
that spent in class and laboratory exercises, but
these merely represent the formal engagements.
There is a never-ending succession of companion
activities to fill in the spare time. Looking over
papers, correcting examinations, turning in grades,
are regular or recurrent duties common to everyone.
But let no one think that correcting home work and
examination papers is all there is to teaching. Very
frequently a teacher may spend more time and
labor making up a problem than he does in correct-
ing the returns on it.
Preparation for class is a highly varying demand
on one's time. It goes without saying that every
instructor knows some parts of his work so well
that he could walk into class after a year's leave of
absence and deliver a dissertation almost without
thinking about it. This, however, is exceptional;
any fairly stiff subject calls for a repetition of prepa-
ration each semester it is given. Everyone has
heard of the new instructor who was only a day,
or an hour, ahead of his class. As a matter of fact,
every good teacher of engineering subjects always
is a day or so ahead of his class. He cannot count
on last semester's, or last year's preparation, to
carry him through. Memory is not reliable enough

to permit that, and if it were, to depend on memory
is to decide against progress in revision of all kinds.
Then there is committee work. The teacher is a
member of his departmental staff; a member of his
college faculty; and a member of the university.
The yearly dues for these various memberships are
extracted from him in the form of service given
through committee work and the like. It is not un-
usual for one to be serving on ten temporary and
permanent committees at the same time. When it
is remembered that a faculty is a very complex
body, and that education is flanked and trimmed
with special considerations, movements, actions,
duties, honors, disciplines, convocations, meetings,
and so on, it is easily seen that a faculty man is in
for a round of organization work not equalled, per-
haps, by that of any fairly similar group of men in
business or industry.
In addition to the duties with which the campus
burdens the teacher, the world at large contributes
its share. Conventions of all kinds have a way of
coming to the campus. Industry sends representa-
tives to employ seniors. Papers must be written
and presented to societies. Somebody must write
books. Somebody must review books. Technical
societies create numberless committees, and com-
mittees must have members. It need hardly be said
in so many words, that the only way an engineer-
ing teacher can dodge some of these duties is to
keep his head buried in the sands. A man in that
position, however, be it noted, is probably suitably
placed; he is already partly buried, at least.
The preceding paragraphs are not written with
the intent of frightening anyone away from the
teaching profession, although anyone who is un-
willing to take on at least some extra curricular
duties had better go elsewhere. The point is, that
monotonous repetition is the last condition discov-
erable in the life of an engineering teacher. There
is fortunately just enough of it to balance the in-
finite and distracting variety.
This paper has so far said nothing about the
teacher's initial preparation, and nothing about his
later indulgence either in research or the practice of
engineering. There is not the space here for treat-
ing these subjects at all fully. Is there one best way
for a man to prepare himself for the engineering
teaching profession? There is not. It is too much
of an individual matter. Should every engineering
teacher do research work? Again, that is an indi-
vidual matter. And if he does not do some research-
ing, must he be expected to carry a sideline of prac-
tice, or engage in practice during vacations? Still
again, there is no one answer. Anyone interested
in these questions should look into the reports
printed during the last two years in the Journal of
Engineering Education.
Every young man interested in engineering teach-
ing as a profession wants to know something about
the salary question. In the few paragraphs that re-
main, only the most general sort of statement can
be attempted. I think this statement will be sub
scribed to by most of those who are in a position
to form proper judgments: engineering teachers
who are as good as the profession deserves to have,
could usually command considerably better salaries
in business or industry. Young men who are pri-
marily interested in financial returns will, it is
hoped, do better elsewhere. They would be un-
happy in teaching, and for the sake of the profession
alone, should stay out of it. Salaries in general are
enough to live on, even if not as high as they should
be: and some of the positions carry returns of a
satisfying nature. Men of high all-around person-
ality and ability who would go far in the business
world will just as certainly go far in education.
They will become heads of departments, directors
of special bureaus, deans, and sometimes, presi-
dents.
In several instances during the past few years, I
have approached a certain few seniors and gradu-
ates who seemed to me to have exceptionally good
qualifications, and having told them frankly about
the impression they had made, asked them if they
might not consider engineering teaching as a life
work. In practically ever}- case it turned out this
wav: it was the first time anvone had spoken to
them about their qualifications; it was the first time
anyone had proposed the idea of their going into
teaching; they had privately and for some years,
thought of going into teaching; but they had never
gone to any teacher to talk it over.
I fully believe, from these experiences, that some
young men best fitted to enter teaching are likely
to hold the profession in such high regard that in-
nate modesty prevents them from presuming even
to mention to anyone the fact that they would like
to enter it. If there is any truth in this belief, it
becomes the part of those already in the profession
to do some conscious recruiting. Xear the end of
the senior year, when we are busily engaged in
helping seniors to get jobs out in the world, we
ought to be scanning the ranks for a possible future-
teacher of high promise; when we find him, we
should talk to him, go as far as to tell him he seems
to "have the makings," and if we discover him to
have some private leanings in the right direction.
we should encourage him. A little of this now and
then might in time bring a rich harvest. The right
men would enter industry with the fixed intention
of staying there only long enough to acquire cer-
tain experiences and viewpoints; soon they would
become available. The many openings called to our
attention each year might then be more likely to be


Page 23

filled with men who have consciously prepared
themselves to take up a ministry for which they
have high respect, and to which they will bring high
ability and high ideals. The word "ministry" was
not carelessly chosen. No successful teacher would
trade his place for any pulpit.
PNEUMATIC TOOLS
(Continued from page 12)
bar, in the end of which is cut a shallow hole whose
shape corresponds to the shape of rivet head that is
desired. It may be hemispherical, conical, or of a
blunt shape. Another pneumatic tool called a
holder-on is used in conjunction with riveting ham-
mers to firmly brace the head ends of rivets, and yet
provide sufficient cushion to prevent the butt end
from buckling when the rivet is being "started."
The pneumatic tools seen at work on streets and
roads breaking up concrete and asphalt are known
as demolition tools. They are essentially the same
in construction as rock drills, except that they have
no rotating chuck. These tools employ a sharp-
pointed or chisel-shaped bit as a work tool. They
are also used to a large extent in stripping brick
and concrete from steel beams in wrecking work,
and find a wide application in road building.
Clay diggers arc similar in construction to demo-
lition tools and have a spade shaped bit. They
are used to clear away clay from ore deposits in
mines, and in all sorts of underground construction
work such as foundations, tunnels, and sewers.
The valveless stone tools differ greatly in con-
struction from most pneumatic tools. The power is
applied to the stone by means of a variety of chisel-
shaped bits. These tools are used in the manufac-
ture of building stone and in carving and chasing
monuments and tombstones, and all sorts of deco-
rative stone.
Chipping hammers are used in roughly trimming
and shaping stone, and for chipping metals in mines
where they are found in the free state. Chipping
hammers are also used to trim forgings, castings,
and steel billets.
The rotary reciprocating piston type of air tool
is very similar in general design to the two cycle
combustion engine, except for the placement and
operation of the valves. Its problems of design are
very much simpler than those of the percussive
hammer tools, since the valves are directly con-
nected with the piston, accurate, dependable calcu-
lations may be made for its operation.
Many of these rotary air tools are in use at the
present time. The larger types operate hoists, lifts,
and jacks. The smaller hand held tools are widely
used in production work in industry for drilling
steel and wood, in buffing and polishing operations,
for grinding ard sawing, for putting in wood screws,
for putting nuts and bolts together, and for innu-
merable minor uses.
Air compressors are the most firmly established
part of the field of pneumatics. They have changed
comparatively little in the last decade, while the
strides taken in the improvement of pneumatic tools
have been enormous.
The portable type of air compressor is, by far,
the most common. It consists of a combustion en-
CAULKING BOILER RIVETS WITH A C-P ROTARY

gine shafted to a compressor which is connected
to an air tank. They are mounted on a chassis or
carriage for ease of transportation. These compres-
sors are used when the work to be done will con-
sume comparatively little time, and where the place
at which the tools are to be used is distant from
a large source of compressed air. Such jobs as
long ditches and tearing up asphalt or concrete
streets require portable compressors.
At mines and other places where large quantities
of compressed air arc consumed, a stationary com-
pressor plant is maintained. Most of these plants
are steam driven, although some are powered by
large Diesel engines, and a few are driven by elec-
tricity.
Hammer action has been found to be, by far, the
most effective and the most efficient method for
working hard substances such as rock. The pres-
sure exerted on the end of a chisel or tool is in-
versely proportional to the peneration effected by
the blow struck. In granite, for instance, if the
penetration is one one-thousandth of an inch with
a blow of fifty foot-pounds, the pressure exerted on
the granite would be fiftv thousand pounds on an
area equal to that of the edge of the tool. Pres-
sures this great cannot practically be applied with

purely rotational motion. For this reason, percus-
sive hammer tools are used exclusively in drilling
rock formations.
The best modern pneumatic tools are the finest
examples of the machinist's skill combined with the
most ingenious of engineering ability. Pneumatic
tools are built as carefully and as accurately as the
finest timepiece, and yet are as rugged and power-
ful as a forging hammer. They must withstand
the corroding action of water and moisture, and
continuous contact with wet pulverized rock must
not render them unable to operate. In addition,
they must be able to withstand the greatest known
enemy of metals, continuous vibration, and must
withstand repeatedly, great mechanical strains.
From the preceding conditions under which pneu-
matic tools must operate, it is seen that every means
known to modern science must be employed to make
their construction meet requirements.
The steels from which the tools are made are very
carefully analyzed in the laboratory. Much closer
limits are imposed upon steel makers by pneumatic
tool manufacturers than by other consumers of
steel. The physical properties such as tensile
strength, hardness, ductility, and grain structure
must check within a very small margin. The most
minute foreign particle or imperfection in the steel
in such parts as the piston renders them useless.
Here, indeed, is the field where the knowledge
and ingenuity of an expert metallurgist is taxed to
to utmost. Every case of breakage due to vibra-
tion and rough usage is referred to him for expla-
nation. He is the man who must determine every
heat treating operation to which pneumatic tool
parts are subjected, for it is he who is more or
less responsible for every failure of parts which
occurs.
Electric recording pyrometers are used in every
furnace, so that exact temperatures for the whole
run are definitely known. Some of the furnaces
are of the rotary type, in order to obtain accurate
and uniform heating for every piece. Indeed, the
heat treating department of a pneumatic tool plant
is a laboratory in itself.
It has been said that "the tool that is used most
in the manufacture of pneumatic tools is the mi-
crometer," and it could hardly be otherwise. The
working limit on some of the moving parts of a
tool is a quarter of a thousandth of an inch. Manu-
facture cannot be maintained on a purely produc-
tion basis because of the extreme accuracy which is
required; moreover, it would be far too costly to
tool up the plant with automatic machinery, on ac-
count of the ever-changing design of the tools.
The use of castings for the vital parts of pneu-
matic tools is taboo. Steel castings do not possess
the physical qualities which enable forgings to
stand up in the field. Cylinders are forged solid
and the whole cylinder drilled out. Grinding is an
extensive operation, every moving part is ground to
fit. Wherever possible automatic turret lathes and
other automatic machines are used, but this can
be done with very few parts, the majority of them
requiring the personal attention of an experienced
operator.
An extensive experimental department is main-
tained by all pneumatic tool manufacturers. The
engineer in pneumatics must be "on his toes" all
the time. He is forever endeavoring to "beat the
competitor's machine." Indeed, most of the sales
which are made are the result of direct competition
in the field. If his machine is beaten, he must find
out why, he must examine his competitor's ma-
chine, discover why it is better than his, and then
produce a machine which does not infringe upon
anyone's patents, yet is a "world-beater." The ex-
cellency of performance of modern pneumatic tools
is, indeed, surprising when one discovers what a
pitifully small amount of data the pneumatic en-
gineer has for reference. Practically no reference
books are obtainable upon the subject, and the en-
gineer must rely upon his own store of knowledge
and his ingenuity as his only allies in attempting
an improvement. One prominent pneumatic engineer
remarks, "When one considers the magnitude and
age of the pneumatic tool industry, it is a sad com-
mentary upon the ability of our mathematicians
and physicists that practically no data is available
for the engineer or designer of percussive hammer
tools with a freely reciprocating piston, particularly
those having an automatic controlling valve where
piston and valve are mechanically independent of
each other, controlled only by the motive fluid."
The few books which have been written upon the
subject have failed, either through lack of prac-
ticability of application, or because of gross differ-
ences between theoretical data and the actually ob-
served facts. After the engineer has designed a ma-
chine he does not know whether it will do as much,
or more, or less than he has calculated with the best
available data.
Various testing machines for percussive hammer
tools have been designed and made, but their gross
inaccuracy and inconsistency has rendered them
practically useless for successful application by the
engineer. One machine, the Paynter tester, has
found some use, however (see Fig. 1), this ma-
chine measures the foot-pound blow delivered by
the hammer, and records the number of blows
struck per minute. Before operating the testing
machine, the hundred pound steel ball is raised to
various accurately measured heights and allowed
to drop against the plunger. The force of each blow-
is conducted through the oil, which is maintained
under constant pressure, and moves the diaphragm
to which the marker is attached. After these marks


Page 25
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
are recorded, the tool to be tested is mounted he-
fore the plunger and the air turned on. The paper
on which the marks are made moves rapidly for-
ward, and a small geared constant speed motor
makes one mark per second upon the paper with
an additional marker. This machine is unreliable,
however, since the results are not consistent from
time to time and some of the indications are far
from possible. This machine is useful only for re-
cording the approximate intensity of blow, and for
accurately recording the number of blows per min-
ute. Frequently a machine that shows up best on
the tester shows up worst in actual practice.
Many strange phenomena occur in the operation
and testing of pneumatic tools. Changing the size
of a port by one sixteenth of an inch has changed
a failure into a machine which gives marvelous re-
sults. Sometimes when the operation of a tool does
not compare favorably with the standard tool of the
same design, it is found by accurate measurement
to be identical in every detail, yet for some un-
known reason, it does not run properly. The rea-
sons for this sort of occurrence are unknown, yet
the engineer must continue improving his ma-
chines. The field of pneumatics is truly one of the
most interesting fields of practice with which the
mechanical engineer may associate himself,
Almost every modern necessity and convenience
has had its manufacture materially assisted by pneu-
matic tools of some sort. They are but another in-
stance of the ways in which man has caused power
to lighten his burden and increase his enjoyment.
ANTIQUITY OF INVENTIONS
(Continued from page 15)
able for the motion of this engine, yet it were bet-
ter to have it assisted by the labour of some intelli-
gent mover as the heavenly orbs are supposed to
be turned. And therefore if it were big enough to
carry sundry persons together, then each of them
might labour in the causing of this motion; . . ."
"For if the possibility of such a motion be yeelded
(sic), we need not make any scruples of granting
the difficulty of it. It is this must adde (sic) a
glory to the invention; and yet this will not per-
haps seem so very difficult to anyone who hath
but diligently observed the flight of some other
birds, particularly of a Kite, how he will swim up
and down in the air, sometimes at a great height,
and presently again lower, guiding himself by his
train, with his wings extended without any sensible
motion of them; and all this, when there is only
some gentle breath of air stirring, without the help
of any strong forcible wind. Now. I say, if that
fowl (which is none of the lightest) can so very
easily move itself up and down in the air, without
so much as stirring the wings of it; certainly then,
it is not improbable, but that when all the due pro-
portions in such an engine are found out, and when
men by long practice have arrived to any skill and
experience, they will be able in this (as well as in
many other things) to come very near unto the
imitation of nature." * * *
"The other doubt was, whether the strength of
the other persons within it, will be sufficient for
the moving of this engine: I answer, the main dif-
ficulty and labour of it will be in the raising of it
from the ground; neer (sic) unto which, the earth's
attractive vigor, is of greatest efficacy. But for
the better effecting of this, it may be helped by the
strength of winds, and by taking its first rise from
some mounain or other high place. When once it
is aloft in the air, the motion of it will be easie, as
it is in the flight of all kind of birds, which being at
any great distance from the earth, are able to con-
tinue their motion for a long time and way, with
little labour or wearniesse."
But we must not think these ideas of Bishop Wil-
kins lay dormant from the 17th to the 20th century.
For in the early part of the 19th century the English
built automobiles in considerable number, a little less
than fifty. These machines were operated over the
highways as common carriers the same as our auto
busses of today. They were a success both me-
chanically and commereially. It was through the
jealousy and political power of the stagecoach com-
panies and the innkeepers that in 1835-1840 Parlia-
ment enacted laws taxing these vehicles so heav-
ily they could not exist. It was not until the last
decade of the 19th century that Parliament repealed
these tax laws, thus making it possible for any de-
velopment in the automobile industry in England.
We here at the University who refer with some
pride to our naval tank—being one of only two in
America—and the unusual scientific work done
therein, may be a little astonished to learn that in
France in 1802 Robert Fulton built a similar tank.
Here he experimented with models obtaining data
from which he later designed the Clermont.
Something of this modern day must be entirely
new but we become somewhat doubtful when we
learn that the latter part of the 16th century ar-
moured war tanks, and amphibious ones at that,
were used for offensive warfare.i
Most of the ideas embodied in our modern inven-
tions are not new; it is only through mechanical
perfection recently developed that it has been pos-
sible to put these old ideas into practice.

EDITORIALS
AN ANNOUNCEMENT
The Technic is very glad to make this announce-
ment to its many appreciative readers, that begin-
ning with the school year 1928-'29 it will further
attempt to serve the students and alumni of the
engineering college, as well as the field of engi-
neering at large, by publishing eight issues a year
instead of four as has been our policy in the past.
The Michigan Technic is the oldest publication
on this campus and one of the oldest publications of
its kind in the country. It first appeared as the
official organ of the Engineering Society and then
later The Technic grew away from the society and
established itself as an independent organization
with but one purpose, to serve, as best it might,
the alumni and students of the engineering school.
The Technic has had its ups and downs, as any
student organization must have, but it has man-
aged to weather all the storms successfully and is
now ready to advance into new territory with new
and greater responsibilities. The Technic feels
sure that in taking this step forward we will, as we
have in the past, receive the hearty co-operation
and support of the student body, the faculty, the
alumni and our host of other friends.
SENIORS
June and commencement are fast approach-
ing, all too fast, no doubt, for that group of senior
engineers that are going out from Michigan to find
their niche in the wide, wide world. To you seniors
"The Technic" wishes to extend its most hearty
congratulations and best wishes for your success
and achievement. Not all of you will have the priv-
ilege and opportunity of making an outstanding con-
tribution to the field of engineering. A few of you
may be thus honored, but the majority of you will
find it difficult to rise above the level of medioc-
rity. However, this fact should not discourage you
or make you feel that the race is not worth the
candle. For the harder you have to strive, the
greater the obstacles you have to overcome, the
greater your success will be and the higher your
rank. If each of you pursue your task diligently no
matter what it is, and bring to your work the
best you have, you will have nothing to regret
when you look back on your completed tasks after
many years of experience.
It is hardly necessary to say that for those of
us who are to remain here a little longer that we
will regret the passing of the class of '28 from the
campus. We will miss its associations and the
friends we have made in it. However, we will have
to make the best of it as the regular course of
events cannot be changed nor made to stand still.
Yet, in spite of the tinge of sadness that accom-
panies graduation, there is also a wonderful inspir-
ation in the thought that for such a group of young
men it is their commencement, they are beginning
life, they have the world before them.
THE ST. FRANCIS DAM DISASTER
Comparable only to the great Johnstown flood of
1889 is the havoc wrought by the recent collapse
of the giant St. Francis dam in southern Califor-
nia. That such a fate should befall a structure of
only two years standing is indeed a blow to engi-
neering achievement.
The builders of the St. Francis dam were recog-
nized as most capable men in this field, the chief
engineer having already built eighteen other dams
of the Los Angeles supply system. Opinion still
remains undaunted that the St. Francis dam lacked
none of the careful design and structure that was
given to the others. That this dam should fail
while the others of longer standing remain intact
is scarcely, then, to be laid at the door of its de-
signers.
The St. Francis dam disaster, like so many other
misfortunes of lesser magnitude, is merely another
indication of the fallibility of human judgment. No
one man can possibly foresee all the things that
go to make a structure perfect. No one man should
attempt to plan alone a structure the failure of
which will imperil human life. As by the age-old
saying, "No chain is stronger than its weakest
link," so the St. Francis dam was no stronger than
the foundation rock to which it clung. This was the
part overlooked by the builders and the failure of
which cost so many lives and property loss. It
cannot be assumed that any other builder would
have noticed the peculiar nature of the rock upon
which it was planned to build the walls which would
hold in leash the enormous volume of water. It
can, how:ever, be fairly assumed that if the con-
struction had been supervised by more than one
engineer of real responsibility the fault would have
been noticed. The great calamity can serve only
as a lesson to the future. We must let the mis-
takes of the past be the successes of the future,
and profit by our mistakes to make the future more
sound and perfect.

THE COLORADO RIVER PROJECT
No agreement has been reached in Congress re-
garding the Colorado River project. Valuable time
and money has been wasted. What is it all about?
It has been proposed that the Colorado River
be harnessed by a series of dams to give great
quantities of electric power, irrigation systems and
flood control. About 400,000 horse power could be
developed. This is about 80% of the total hydro-
electric power used in the United States last year.
There are millions of acres of arid lands to be de-
veloped and irrigated. The Colorado threatens to
flood the Imperial Valley in California. This threat
could be controlled by the proposed project. These
are but few of the beneficial results to look forward
to, yet the present Congress has mired the propo-
sition deeper than ever.
Jealousy is the chief hindrance to progress. Jeal-
ousy between the seven states regarding water di-
version for irrigation. The proposal is to use the
water after leaving the hydro-electric plants, for the
benefit of arid lands. So much arid land will be
available, however, that not nearly enough water
can be diverted to satisfy all. How should it be
apportioned? This is the greatest cause of dis-
agreement. Congress does not seem to be able to
settle it. The principal quarrel is between Arizona
and California. Why try to settle a private dis-
agreement between several states in Congress?
Surely they are interested because the federal gov-
ernment intends to finance the project. There can
be no question about the financial success or the
soundness of the investment. Therefore the dis-
agreeing states should be advised to settle the dis-
pute among themselves and then bring it up for
federal action when sanction is necessary. Every
effort should be made to keep private influence away
from the proposition.
SUPER-POWER NETWORKS
It was not long ago when all our large power
plants were completely isolated units furnishing
power to separate localities and never in any way
interdependent. Under such a system it was im-
possible to obtain a uniform demand from any one
station and engineers were not long in recognizing
the immense economies that could be accomplished
if a means for stabilizing demand could be devised.
The development of high tension transmission
solved that problem by making it possible to trans-
mit power over long distances without great loss.
Now we find the power stations throughout the
country being tied together in an ever-increasing
network so that a single plant is no longer an inde-
pendent unit but it is a part of a vast system.
Xo better example of industrial harmony and
progress can be found at the present time than this
vast power linkage which is being developed to sup-
ply the entire country with power at the very low-
est rate possible. It is in the interest of such ad-
vances that engineers are continually complicating
their problems and making the qualifications for en-
gineering more exacting. It is in this particular field
that problems are fast coming up which require the
greatest resourcefulness of all engineering. There is
no doubt that engineering will solve these problems
and that the future will bring power at a lower rate
than has yet been possible.
HERBERT HOOVER
Among the great number of men who have
headed our government in the past, not a man can
be found who can lay claim to a professional title;
every man in the long list is either a politician or a
soldier. With few exceptions the great minds of the
age have never been the pilots of our civil offices.
Perhaps this accounts for the many troubles, and
misfortunes with which public affairs have always
been afflicted. Public office does not seek busy men
who are obscure in their places of work, instead it
is the politician, the man who manages ever to keep
in the public eye through innumerable devices,
chiefly the press. Unfortunate as it may be, it seems
to be a fact that the voters choose the man who has
received the most publicity. This state of affairs
has long been lamented by scientists and profes-
sional men, but a ray of hope is strongly apparent.
A movement is on foot to install a professional man
in the country's highest office. There is high hope
that at last one of the "men who do things" may be
installed in the Presidential chair of the United
States.
Renowned as a great engineer, and a national
figure in organization, Herbert Hoover is, indeed,
worthy of serious consideration as a Presidential
candidate. Hoover is a man who is used to doing
things on a large scale, and it is generally admitted
that he gets them done with the least trouble. His
unfailing exploits during the World War in caring
for the war-stricken peoples of Europe have gained
him universal fame, and his solutions of America's
own problems have gained him a warm place in the
heart of every citizen. But his methods are not
those of the "steam-roller" politician, nor the terse
orders of the soldier, rather, they are those of the
engineer, inspiring desire for progress by their own
abundance of energy and persuasive by their un-
failing ability to sec the way clear. Some will con-
tend that an engineer does not belong in civil office,
yet who is better equipped? The art of analysis and
the ability to reach a solution are surely the great
requisites for any executive position. As an engi-
neer Hoover possesses this ability accompanied by
a train of experience in solving the country's com-

White Lights Versus North Skylight
For Color Discrimination
In the development of artificial lighting a pro-
pituous stage has been reached for exploding the
tradition that north skylight is the best quality of
light for the discrimination of color. In the past,
when artificial light was entirely unsuitable for
color discrimination, those interested in colors chose
north skylight because it was more nearly con-
stant in quality than light from any other region of
the sky. Hence it has become traditional to con-
sider it the standard of daylight. Unfortunately,
this so-called standard is quite variable in inten-
sity and spectral character from hour to hour and
from day to day.
The illuminant most suitable for color work is
one which does not favor any particular color.
White light is the only illuminant satisfactory in
this respect. Spectrally, it is practically identical
with noon sunlight on a clear day when the sun
is at a high altitude. In white light the radiant
energy is nearly equal in amount from all wave
lengths throughout the visible spectrum. Since
north skylight from a clear sky is quite bluish, it
makes the purples (pink, lavender, etc.) appear more
bluish than they would appear in white light. Be-
cause of its deficiency in jrellow, orange and red,
north skylight suppresses these colors in objects il-
lumined by it.
Those who developed artificial daylight found it
necessary to supply a quality of light simulating
north skylight because of the firmly intrenched
habit of using north skylight for color work. Here
is one of the many cases where what people want
and what is best are two different things. Inas-
much as color discrimination does not involve taste.
it seems that science rather than habit should dic-
tate what an illuminant should be for general color
work.
To produce artificial north skylight with tungsten
filament lamps it is necessary to absorb about 85%
of the light. However, to produce white-light cor-
responding to noon sunlight on a clear day in sum-
mer, an absorption of only 60% is necessary. In
other words, white light—the only illuminant which
is scientifically sound for color discrimination—can
be produced with tungsten lamps at nearly three
times the efficiency of artificial north skylight. —

A High Temperature Motor
Fifty-five degrees C rise, plus 90 degrees C am-
bient, adds to 145 degrees C, or about 290 degrees
F., a most unusual operating temperature for a
motor. However, such a motor has been built. It
is a 10 horse power, 230-volt direct current motor
and will operate on the top of a steam boiler as a
drive for stokers. This unusual motor application
is the result of the extremely crowded condition
of the particular power house.
The motor is not allowed to fan itself in the usual
open motor fashion, as the dust-laden air around
it would soon allow dirt to collect in the windings
and short circuit the commutator. The motor is
entirely enclosed and is, therefore, of considerable
size for its power output.
Paper, cotton, silk or any of the commonly used
class A insulating materials are, of course, entirely
out of the question for such a motor. Some few
bits of cotton string were used to tie the coils to-
gether and hold them in place until the motor was
built. It is expected, however, that they will en-
tirely carbonize in a short time after the motor
goes into service. For insulation, then, only mica
and asbestos were eligible. The mica is the usual
built-up type. The binder, too. in this case will
carbonize, but as its only function is to supply
mechanical strength until the mica tape is in place,
this in unimportant. The gum commonly used in
the field coils was replaced by varnish. Gum would
start to ooze from the coil long before the operat-
ing temperatures were reached.
The motor is equipped with standard ball bear-
ings, though a special, high-flash point of lubricant
is necessary. At normal temperatures the lubri-
cant is a thick, heavy grease; at the motor operating
temperatures it is a thin grease.—The Electric Jour-
nal.
Decimal Money and Weights
The king of England has just directed the English
mint to issue a new series of coins. No change
will be made in the values of the coins, except that
the crown will be reintroduced into the British mon-
etary system. The crown is worth about $1.20.
The values of other English coins are about as fol-
lows: Farthings, half a cent; halfpennies, 1 cent:
pennies, 2 cents; three-penny pieces, 6 cents; six
penny pieces, 12 cents! shillings, about 24 cents:


Page 29
THE MICHIGAN TECHN1C
two shillings, about 48 cents; half crowns, about 60
cents; half sovereigns, about $2.40, and sovereigns,
about $4.80.
Compared with our money, in the multiples of
ten, the difficulties of computation in English money
are tremendous. Converting farthings and pence
into shillings and crowns takes a mental effort and
wastes much time. Fortunately we got on a deci-
mal basis in our money at the beginning, but un-
fortunately we still deal in inches and feet, gallons
and quarts, ounces and pounds, which are just as
awkward as the English money. It is time we ap-
plied the decimal or metric system to our units of
measurement. A new bill legalizing the metric sys-
tem in this country will be introduced in the next
Congress. If it passes, once we become used to it
we would no more return to our present system of
weights and measures than we would adopt the
awkward English money—Des Moines Register.
For the Field Engineer
In the introduction to the Field Manual of the
Iowa State Highway Commission for federal and
state aid road and bridge work Mr. F. R. White,
chief engineer of the commission, gives the follow-
ing suggestions to the field engineers:
This manual is prepared to assist you in so dis-
charging your duties that your work will harmon-
ize with the methods and requirements of the gen-
eral office. You should first become familiar with
the regulations herein outlined. Next you should
master the details of the particular piece of work
to which you have been assigned.
When you show up on a job, you are, in the eyes
of the local people, the State Highway Commis-
sion. If you make good, the commission makes
good. If you fail, the commission fails. You may
be a hundred miles or more from the district head-
quarters and twice that distance from the general
office. You are, largely speaking, your own boss.
This places on you entire responsibility for your
conduct. You must often be your own judge of
the propriety of any given course of action.
Your first duty is to efficiently, accurately, and
honestly perform the duties assigned to you. Your
next duty is to make friends of all those with whom
you come in contact. If you fail in either of these,
you have not made good. The people along the
road will appreciate information relative to the im-
provement proposed. They will ask many ques-
tions. Answer them courteously. Go out of your
way to give them the information they want. We
have no place on our force for the man who gives
a smart or insolent reply to any inquiry that may
be made of him. Get acquainted with the editors
of the local papers. Get them interested in your
work. Take them out to see the job. Make friends
of them. Get in close touch with the countv board.
the county engineer, and the auditor. They can
help you when you need it. Remember that if you
make good, we will hear about it, and if you fail
we will hear about that also, even though you are
a long way from the office.
The resident engineer or party chief is respon-
sible for the actions of those under him, as well as
for his own actions. If you have a man under you
who assumes that he is a superior sort of individ-
ual because he is working for the state, fire him.
We have no place for such men.
Always assume that your work is wrong until
you have checked and rechecked it to such an ex-
tent that you have eliminated every possibility of
error. Never ignore a suggestion bv anyone on the
job, even though he be the lowest laborer, He may
be right and you may be wrong. I remember an
incident that came to my attention some years ago.
An engineer was staking out a pier for a viaduct.
The foreman of the pile driver doubted the accu-
racy of the measurement, and expressed his doubts
to the engineer. The engineer's reply was: "I'm
doing this measuring." "All right," said the fore-
man, "and you are responsible if it isn't right."
Later, after a considerable quantity of work had
been done, it was proven that the engineer was
wrong. It cost the company many thousands of
dollars. It cost the engineer his job. His refusal to
listen to the foreman's doubts and to check his own
measurements, meant the difference between suc-
cess and failure.
Another thing. Avoid all appearance of loafing
on the job. Never let the members of your engi-
neering force take guns, baseballs, bats, or other
sporting paraphernalia out to the work with them.
You will get "in bad" if you do. We understand, of
course, that when there are enough men on your
force to do the work promptly and efficiently, there
are times when in the natural progress of the work,
one or more of your men will be idle for a short
time. But the public does not understand these
things. They are looking for something to criti-
cize. Don't give them the chance. Arrange your
work so as to keep each man busy a maximum per
cent of the time. Get your men on the job promptly
in the morning and keep them there until a full
day's service has been rendered. This will avoid
much talk and criticism from the local people.
The Romance of Antimony
Antimony is one of the metals that has few uses
in industry. Yet no American daily newspaper is
printed without the help of antimony, which, with
lead and tin, forms the mental from which type is
made.
The use of antimony dates back a great many
centuries. It was employed by the ancients to color

THE ENGINEERING OPEN HOUSE
All that was lacking was the plaintive note of the
peanut vender's whistle, the droning roll of the
barkers, and the bright hued banners of the side
shows to make the Open House a miniature
World's Fair. All else was present; the crowd;
the intricate machinery; the demonstrations; the
mysterious inventions; the get-rich-quick gold
brick artists, and the gentle hoaxers.
To attempt to describe the displays would be an
impossible task. It took at least a half day to
make the rounds and then there was a feeling that
you had missed half of the excitement. The aero-
nautical, automotive, chemical, civil, electrical, ma-
rine, mechanical, military, and physics departments
took it upon themselves to furnish displays each
of which was sufficient reason for an Open House.
The aero department with its models, drawings,
and wind tunnel took a big share of the interest of
the visitors.
The automotive department's display of automo-
bile and aeroplane engines was a center of attrac-
tion. Everyone was especially interested in the
excellent display of aeroplane engines, most inter-
esting of which was the famous Wright Whirl-
wind motor,
The chemicals were on deck with their lectures,
microscopic displays and above all, with their po-
tent cure-all raise-all thirst-satisfying cherry-colored
distillate the name and formula of which seems to
be a profound secret.
The civils had many and divers displays which
were representative of their numerous specialized
sub-departments of which hydraulics, surveying,
structural and transportation engineering were very
Tvell represented. Too much credit cannot be given
to the highway and transportation departments for
their parts in the occasion. The models of loco-
motives and cars and the moving pictures furnished
by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad were two of
the outstanding features of the Open House. The
models of road machinery, the highway crossing
problem worked in sand, and the cross-sectioned
road models of the highway department were dis-
plays which are seldom equaled.
The department of geodesy and surveying had
on exhibition a very comprehensive display of in-
struments of both antique and modern design. To
the engineer the display of instruments was per-
haps most interesting, but to the visitor there were
two instruments which were interesting not so much
because of their design, but because of their his-
tory. There was the transit which was used by
Prof, Hobbs on his Greenland expedition and a
sun compass of the type used by CommandeV Byrd
in his flight over the north pole. This sun com-
pass was one of three constructed for the expe-
dition. It is not known which of the three made
the flight so that there is a chance that the one on
display was the compass used.
The electricals presented a formidable array of
motors, generators, switch boards, and other elec-
trical apparatus for the approval of the visitors. It
seemed to be hard enough for most of the visitors
to put the horse shoes on the peg without having
them immediately jump off when they did succeed
in getting them on.
The marine engineers had their naval tank work-
ing overtime giving visitors rides and demonstra-
tions on the towing car. The wax models and the
model cutting machine were the source of much
favorable comment on the part of the spectators.
There was to be found in the mechanical labora-
tory one of the most instructive and entertaining
displays of the Open House. Steam turbines, wa-
ter turbines, gas and steam engines, pumps, refrig-
eration plant and hoaxes combined to make the
mechanical lab one of the busiest and most popu-
lar spots of the Open House. We have since
learned that a score of people have succumbed to
the terrors of brain fever as a result of trying to
fathom the secrets involved in the mystery six per-
petual motion machine, the Hindoo fakir, and the
never emptying bottle. It is most fortunate for the
supporters of the 18th amendment that the bottle
in question contained only water.
After wandering through the R. O. T. C. unit's
display examining some of the Army's playthings,
we formed a few opinions on the beauties of war.

It seems to us that some of those guns are built
for no good purpose. Of course it all depends on
that end of the barrel at which you are looking
when the trigger is squeezed. Still we think that
it would be just as healthy for all concerned if
they would take a tip from the engineers and laws
and toss cold water, grape fruit, and rotten eggs
instead of lead slugs
and steel peas.
The success of the
Open House not only
reflected the great
amount of careful
thought and work on
the part of the commit-
tees in charge but also
the earnest support of
each engineer. Such an
undertaking is of the
type which is either a
huge success or an
equally big failure. No
matter how hard the
committees may work,
the degree of success
depends on the size

We have heard somewhere (we
cannot now remember just where)
that Perry's parents like all parents
confronted with the problem of
choosing a son's vocation put him
through the old oft - used apple,
bible, and dollar test. Putting him
and the afore-mentioned articles on
the floor of the living room they
left him to choose his own vocation.
On returning a half hour later they
found apple, bible and dollar intact. But there sat the young
hopeful, greasy, dirty, complacent, in the midst of a suc-
cessfully dissected phonograph. It was evident that Perry
was to be none other than an engineer of the mechanical
species.
Like all well-informed, enterprising aspirants to the engi-
neering profession, Perry made his way to Michigan, where
he enrolled as most Freshmen do. Aside from partcipating
in a few activities he did nothing other than earn the repu-
tation of being an excellent student, which is enough for
any Freshman to do. It was during his junior and senior
years that Perry assumed the leadership of several of the
most important of engineering activities. He was elected
chairman of the Student Branch of the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers, president of the Transportation
Club, and chairman of the Michigan Engineering Society.
He also served as chairman of the Engineering Open
House, the success of which was due fn a large measure to
his efforts.
Under his guidance the various societies have experienced
phenomenal increases in activity and spirit. He organized
and led the Transportation Club in such a manner as to
make it one of the most active of engineering societies. In
the case of the Michigan Engineering Society he succeeded
in bringing to life an almost defunct organization. His part
in the Engineering Open House cannot be over-estimated.
Recently, Perry was awarded the Strathcona Scholarship
in Transportation Engineering. This scholarship is awarded
each year to five college students in the United States and
Canada. It is good for a year's work in any phase of trans-
portation engineering taught at Yale University. The schol-
arship is one which is very much desired among engineer-
ing students and it is considered no little honor to receive
it. With his graduation the college loses an excellent
student, and a man who has worked unselfishly and tire-
lessly for the good of his college.

activities of the A. I. E. E. in this district, Mr. W.
D. Beaise of the railway department of the General
Electric Company is making a lecture tour of the
student branches in this district. He will give a
lecture, illustrated with slides on "The Application
of Electricity to Railways," on April 30, in room
348.
At the last meeting which will be held on May
22 the Stone and Webster films showing the con-
struction of the new hydro-electric plant. Cono-
wingo, on the Susquehanna River, will be shown.
The Conwingo project is a very large development,
its initial capacity being greater than the initial ca-
pacity of Muscle Shoals and its completed capacity
will be the largest in the United States, 594,000
horse power.
Two General Electric films will be shown. One
shows the manufacture of a 50,000 horse power
steam turbine generator and the other shows the
manufacture of Mazda lamps. After the films the
election of new officers will take place.
lota Alpha
At a combined meeting of Iota Alpha and the
Junior Research Club Mr. White and Mr. Lindblacl
spoke on the subjects of ship forms and heat trans-
fer respectively. In his talk Mr. Lindblad pointed
out the necessity of carefully planning ship mod-
els. He stated that it was a very easy matter to
design a ship so that it takes from thirty to fifty
per cent more power to operate it than is necessary.
In some cases the department has tested models
which were more easily propelled backward than
forward. Mr. White treated the subject of heat
transference in a broad manner.
At the next meeting Prof. Sherlock will talk about
his work in relation to the experimental transmis-
sion line which he has been operating for the Na-
tional Electric Light Association.
A. S. M. E.
On Saturday, May 26, the Student Branch of the
A. S. M. E. will hold a joint meeting with the
members of the Detroit section. The Detroit sec-
tion will arrive early in the day in order to make
a trip about the campus. In the afternoon they will
attend the baseball game at Ferry Field. The meet-
ings will include several lectures and discussions.
Transportation Club
At the meeting of the Transportation Club, which
was held April 18, motion pictures on the electri-
fication of railroads were shown. This meeting was
held jointly with the A. I. E. E. The pictures
were furnished by the Westinghouse Corporation.
On Tuesday, April 24. Harrison S. Taft, who
has spent a large part of his life on the Pacific
coast, gave an illustrated lecture on Pacific port de-
velopment.
The last meeting of this school year will be held
on May 2. At this meeting Mr. E. T. Howson. who
is the western editor of "The Railroad Age." will
come from Chicago to deliver a lecture to the club.
The Transportation Club and the American So-
ciety of Mechanical Engineers have planned two

Chemical Engineering Department
Three U. S. Naval post-graduate officers have
been selected by the Navy department to come to
Ann Arbor to specialize in ordinance explosives.
They are officers who have made very good records
in their work at the Naval school. They are Lieut.
Howard R. Healy, U. S, N.; Lieut. Adelbert F. Con
verse, U. S. N.; Lieut. Tom B. Hill, U. S. N.
Mr, E. P. Partridge, of the Chemical Engineering
Department has been carrying on research work on
the problem of boiler scale, its nature, method, and
rate of formation. For use in his work he has con
structed a small boiler housed in a thermostat. The
scale is formed on an iron rod which projects up
through the bottom of the boiler. The rod is so
constructed as to act as a thermo-couple, thus
making it possible to measure both the temperature
at which the scale forms and the temperature drops
in the rod incident to the formation of the scale.
The scale seems to be due to the formation of
either steam or air bubbles which deposit a thin
ring of Ca SO4 at their edge. This ring serves as a
nucleous for the formation of the scale. Mr. Pat-
ridge has drawn his conclusions to a large extent
through the use of a microscopic motion picture
camera which he has arranged for his work. After
completing his work on the determination of the
causes of the scale, he hopes to study the effect
of the several preparations which are on the mar-
ket for the purpose of eliminating boiler scale.
Civil Engineering Department
Prof. Riggs of the Civil Department has been
granted a two years' leave of absence by the Board
of Regents. He will devote his time to private en-
gineering practice, having been retained by several
large railroads as an expert adviser on evaluation
problems. His office will be in the Michigan Thea-
ter Building. No definite changes have been made
in the department incident to his retirement.
A meeting of the National Electric Light Asso-
ciation was held in Ann Arbor on April 19 for the
purpose of inspecting the experimental transmis-
sion line which the department is operating at pres-
ent. There was a discussion of a program for fur-
ther investigation of the work under the direction
of Prof. Sherlock.
Plans have been made for the installation of a
new hydraulic laboratory under the direction of
Professor King. One of the main features of the
laboratory is to be a flume and pipes leading from
the present canal in the mechanical laboratory to a
flume which is to be built in the mold loft on the
third floor of the West Engineering building. The
channel will be about fifty feet long, will have a
capacity of ten cubic feet per second, and will be
arranged so that the water will be discharged into
the weighing scales located in the mechanical lab-
oratory. The flume is expected to be ready for use
with the beginning of next semester.
Camp Davis opens this year on Monday, June
25. The students must be at the camp on Friday,
June 23. After running for a period of eight weeks
the camp comes to a close on August 17. It is ex-
pected that there will be about thirty students and
six members of the faculty at the camp this sum-
mer.
R. O. T. C.
The R. O. T. C. unit is sending some fifty men
to the different summer camps this year. There
are about thirty going to Ft. Sheridan, 11l., two to
Ft. Monroe, Va., twelve to Aberdine, Md., six to
Schnute Field, Rantoule, 11l., and one to Platts-
burg Barracks, N. Y. The camps open on June 17.
PORTLAND CEMENT
(Continued from page 18)
United States, as against 164,530,000 for 1926. Pro-
duction, therefore, increased a little less than 4.5
per cent. Consumption for 1927 was 170,922,000 as
against 162,187,000 for the previous year. The in-
crease of 1927 consumption over that for 1926 is ,(
little more than five per cent.
A study of these figures shows that Michigan,
like the rest of the country, is producing more port-
land cement than she is actually using but that her
use of this material increased nearly three times as
fast as that of the United States as a whole.
In producing enough portland cement to more
than supply the needs of Michigan, the mills were
not overtaxed. During the months of August. Sep-
tember and October, they manufactured 4,910,000
barrels. If this figure is taken as an index of the
mills' capacity for a quarter year period, one may
conclude that they might have, if necessary, pro-
duced 19,640,000 barrels, or 43 per cent more than
that used during 1927. If, however, one takes the
production for July, 1927, which was 1,692,000 bar-
rels, as the index for a month's capacity, one finds
that these mills can produce 20,305,000 barrels, or
48 per cent more than the state's 1927 consump-
tion.
As in many other industrial fields, Michigan has
been brought to a conspicuous rank in the produc-
tion of portland cement not entirely through nat-
ural resources, but through the combination of such
wealth with the courage and far-sighted business
policy of the men who first entered the new field.

THE NEW DEAN—PROF. H. C. SADLER
SINCE the announcement last spring that Dean
Cooley had resigned his duties due to pro-
longed ill health, the Engineering College,
while greatly regretting the loss of this most re-
vered man, has been eagerly looking forward to
the appointment of a new dean. It is with sincer-
est pleasure that the Engineering College wel-
comes Professor Herbert C.
Sadler as dean. Dean Sadler
will officially assume his du-
ties on July first at which
time he will relieve in part
the responsibilities of Assist-
ant Dean Patterson, who has
so successfully discharged
the duties of that office dur-
ing the absence of Dean
Cooley.
Herbert Charles Sadler
was born in London, Eng-
land, August 27, 1872. He
w a s educated at Dulwich
College, London, and the
University of Glasgow, Scot-
land. He entered the Uni-
versity in 1890, and received
the degree of B. Sc. in 1893,
the degree of D. Sc. in 1902,
and the honorary degree of
L.L.D. in 1927. In the sum-
mer of 1890 he also entered,
as an apprentice, the firm of
A. &amp; J. Ignlis, engineers and
shipbuilders, and until grad-
uation spent his summers and winters alternately
in practical work and at the University. After
graduation he completed his apprenticeship in the
drafting room, and was employed in that capacity
until 18%. He was then appointed as assistant to
Professor Sir John Harvard Biles, who was then
professor of Naval Architecture at the University,
and lecturer in Marine Engineering. He was also
associated with Professor Sir John Biles in his
private work as consultant to many steamship lines.
In the fall of 1900, the University of Michigan de-
cided to inaugurate a regular course in Naval Archi-
tecture and Naval Engineering, and Professor Sad-
ler was chosen to take charge of this new depart-
ment. He has held this position until the present
time.
Shortly after he came to the University of Michi-
gan the authorities decided to build a marine model
testing tank. The design of this tank and the ac-
companying equipment was placed under the super-
vision of Professor Sadler. He had done a large
amount of research work in this tank pertaining
to the resistance of ships while running in water.
The results of these tests have been published in
many papers read before the various institutions
of naval architects, and also appear in most of the
leading textbooks dealing with this subject. He
has also contributed many
papers relating to the design
and construction of ships,
both to various institutions
and to the technical press.
Since his appointment as
professor of Naval Architec-
ture at the University of
Michigan, he has engaged in
a general consulting prac-
tice, both in the L" n i t e d
States and Canada. He has
acted as appraiser of vessel
property for the state of
Michigan, and consultant to
many of the steamship lines.
He has been responsible for
the design of many famous
Great Lakes vessels, and
numerous ferry boats.
In public matters he has
acted as consulting naval
architect to the board of U.
S. Army engineers, in con-
nection with the question of
transportation on the Missis-
sippi River. For some years
he has been a member of the Technical Advisory
Board of the American Bureau of Shipping. New
York, and has been recently appointed chairman of
the committee on Naval Architecture for the Great
Lakes district. He was also sent as a representative
of this district to the international conference on
the safety of ships, held in London in 1913. He was
a member of the U. S. Load Line committee in 1920.
During the World War he was engaged in the
first stages of experimental work upon submarines,
and methods of protection to merchant vessels.
Later he was appointed consulting naval engineer
to the U. S. Shipping Board, Emergency Fleet Cor-
poration, and in this connection had charge of the
engineering section which was responsible for the
design and construction of all merchant vessels
built during the war.
He has been recently appointed to the committee
of design for the proposed four day Atlantic liner.

Echoes from the Graduates
CHARLES FRANCIS BRUSH
OF all Michigan's renowned alumni, none have In 1845 the Wright arc lamp, which consisted of
gained greater fame as pioneer inventors and five carbon disks, was patented in England. Its
scientists than Charles Francis Brush. For success was not very pronounced, but it was a
almost half a century this man has been considered slight improvement over Davey's arc lamp,
an eminent authority and an ardent experimenter Perhaps the most successful European arc lamp
in the field of electricity. As one of America's fore- was the one which was developed in 1876 by Jab-
most consulting electrical engineers, he has, indeed, lochkoff, an engineer living in Paris. His arc lamp
done much to advance electric-
ity to the prominent position it
occupies today.
Charles Francis Brush was
born March 17, 1849, in Euclid
Township, Cuyahoga County,
Ohio, and has spent most of his
life in the city of Cleveland
which is a few miles from
there. He received his early
education in Cleveland, and en-
tered the University of Michi-
gan immediately upon his grad-
uation from high school. He
obtained his degree as a mining
engineer in 1869. For three
years after his graduation he
worked as an analytical mining
engineer, and during the next
four years worked as a metal-
lurgist in the refining of iron
ores.
During all these years Brush
had been carrying on practical experiments with
electricity in his spare time, and in 1878 he pre-
sented to the public the perfected Brush arc lamp,
unquestionably his greatest discovery. The per-
fection of his lamp followed many failures and par-
tial successes of European inventors who were
working along the same line.
The first arc lamp was built by Sir Humphrey
Davey in 1801, and was constructed of two pieces
of solid carbon; the current was supplied by an
enormous two thousand cell storage battery. This
lamp was not very successful, but was the fore-
runner of the arc lamp of today.
CHARLES FRANCIS BRUSH
consisted of two pieces of car-
bon, separated by a thin strip
of insulating material, a n d
bound tightly together. The
light produced by this ar-
rangement was about two hun-
dred candle power, and was
used to light a street in Paris
during an exhibition. A Yale
professor who happened to be
visiting Paris at that time
wrote to his friends at home
about the arc lamp and told
them that "the light produced
by this lamp was very brilliant
and very beautiful."
All of the pioneer inventors
were handicapped by the lack
of an efficient means of gen-
erating a strong, steady cur-
rent. The electric dynamo had
not been perfected at this time.
This fact accounts for the great
number of failures among arc lamp inventors.
While all these efforts were being made in Eu-
rope to produce a successful arc lamp, Charles
Brush was experimenting at his home with rods
made of pulverized coke, lampblack, and svrup,
which he baked in the kitchen stove. When he had
at last obtained two rods which he thought were
of the right composition, he connected them to the
poles of his dynamo, touched the ends together,
then separated them a fraction of an inch. A
brilliant electric arc was instantaneously formed
which was soon to become the famous Brush arc
lamp.


May, 1928
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The formation of the electric arc is very simple.
The ends of the carbon rods are heated by the cur-
rent, and the arc consists of hot particles of carbon
along which the current leaps from one rod to the
other in a brilliant thread of light. The very high
temperature of the electric arc causes the carbon to
oxidize, and the carbon rods must be adjusted oc-
casionally to keep the distance between their ends
constant.
Brush's arc lamp immediately became far more
popular than any of the European lamps for two
reasons: it produced a more steady light, and it
was so constructed that it could be connected in
series, a great advantage in street lighting. It
was soon in use all over the world, and they may
be seen in almost every city, for illuminating streets.
Brush made many more important discoveries in
the field of electricity, notably his improvements
on the direct current dynamo.
In 1880 Mr. Brush established a company for the
manufacture of his arc lamp and other electrical
appliances which he had developed. This company
later merged with another electrical concern.
Mr. Brush retired from active business life in
1891, but he still maintains an experimental labor-
atory at his Cleveland home. He has since con-
tributed many valuable scientific papers upon his
electrical research.
Mr. Brush has held many important positions,
and has been the recipient of many awards. In
1871 he was made a Chevalier of the Legion of
Honor, by the French government. In 1899 he was
awarded the Rumford medal by the American Acad-
emy of Arts and Sciences for "The Practical De-
velopment of Electric Arc Lighting," a detailed
account of his work on the arc lamp. The Ameri-
can Institute of Electrical Engineers presented him
with the Edison medal in 1913.
At present he is president of the Cleveland Ar-
cade Company, he was organizer and the first pres-
ident of the Linde Air Products Company. He is
a trustee of Western Reserve University and Adel-
bert College, University School, and the Cleveland
School of Art. He is a member of the Union Club,
and was president for two years. He is a member
of the University, the Country, and the Mayfield
clubs of Cleveland. He is president of the Winow's
Point Shooting Club, and a member of the Uni-
versity Club of New York City, and of the Royal
Societies Club of London.
He married Miss Mary E. Morriss of Cleveland
in 1875, and they have three children: Edna, now
Mrs. R. G. Perkins, Helene, and Charles Francis,
Jr., Harvard 1915.
Mr. Brush has never lost his ardent liking for
electricity, and enjoys predicting the wonders which
electricity will perform in the future.

THE NEW DEAN
(Continued from page 34)
He has also been appointed to the International
Conference on Safety of Life at Sea, to be held in
London next year.
Dean Sadler was also responsible for the inaugu-
ration and development of the courses in Aeronau-
tical Engineering at the University of Michigan,
and was for some time the acting head of the de-
partment.
He is a member of many noted engineering so-
cieties of note, and is very active in social affairs at
the University.
Dean Sadler has a sympathetic feeling for all
branches of engineering since, in some phase, they
all come under the category of Marine Engineering.
He believes, for this reason, that he will experience
little difficulty in being able to understand the prob-
lems of the various departments in the Engineer-
ing College which will be brought to him for solu-
tion.
Although it would be impossible for any man to
fully replace Dean Cooley in the hearts of the stu-
dents and alumni of the Engineering College, there
is every reason to believe that Professor Sadler
will soon establish a similar position for himself,
and he has already gone far toward doing this in
his past work with the University.
On behalf of the students and faculty of the En-
gineering College, The Technic wishes Professor
Sadler the greatest success in his greatest under-
taking. Q
CROSSING THE ATLANTIC
(Continued from page 13)
say, from thirty-eight to forty miles per hour. To
attain this speed and take care of the accommoda-
tion of passengers, mail and possibly some high
class package freight, the vessels will be between
nine hundred and one thousand feet in length, and
with machinery capable of developing something
over one hundred and sixty thousand horse power.
They will probably use what is known as the elec-
tric drive, the power being generated by high speed
turbines which will in turn supply the current to
slower speed motors which will drive the propel-
lers. Recent developments in the use of high pres-
sure superheated steam and oil fuel have rendered
economies in weight and consumption such that
there should be no great difficulties in obtaining
the above speeds. The use of modern high tensile
steel in the construction of the ships, will also tend
towards economy of weight in the structure of the
vessels. The size and speed of the largest waves
met with in the Atlantic do not increase with the
size and speed of the ships, but are a constant fac-
tor. Hence the larger and faster ship has a dis-
tinct advantage when it comes to questions of sea-
going qualities.
From an engineering point of view, although the
problem is one considerably in advance of existing
practice, careful consideration of all details would
seem to show that it is perfectly feasible.
From the economic considerations, one rather
fundamental feature is involved. The present day
fast liners make about fourteen round trips per an-
num, but with the faster type, combined with a re-
duction of time in port at each end, at least thirty
trips can be made. This means that the fixed
charges for overhead, etc., per trip are considerably

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
reduced. Analysis of trans-Atlantic travel for re-
cent years has shown that the trend is towards
the larger and faster vessel, and there is no reason
to suppose this will change. Railroad and highway
transportation also show the same tendency, so it
is necessary to use some vision and not he too timid
in looking toward the future. Increased facilities
in transportation have always induced increased
trade, and perhaps it is not stretching our imagi-
nation too far to suppose that in the near future, if
the trip from the west to the east may be made in
three days, and that across the Atlantic in four, or
one week from San Francisco to Europe, a large
amount of new travel will he engendered.
In the bills now before Congress, it is proposed
that the government "loan" money for construction
purposes at a low rate of interest, the principal to
be returned within a stated period. This would
enable the financing to be done on a reasonable
basis, and help to bridge the present gap in the cost
of construction here as compared with that abroad.
If the proposal above outlined should go through,
it would mean building six vessels, all identicall}
the same, and provide for a vessel leaving both sides
of the Atlantic every second day.
One other feature would be that these vessels
would form a valuable addition to the Navy if oc-
casion should arise; in fact they would be a com-
bination of fast airplane carrier and scout cruiser
in time of war, and an economic asset to the coun-
try in time of peace.
Incidentally also, they would represent the be-
ginning of a new era in the re-establishment of the
American merchant marine.

the hair and the eyebrows and to make the eye
seem larger; all of which were thought to be marks
of beauty. In the middle ages antimony was used
as a medicine and as early as 1500 A. D. it was used
in type metal and for mirrors and bells. A few of
these uses continue to the present day.
While this nation produces many of the raw ma-
terials it uses, there are a number of commodities
which it can secure only from the other side of the
globe. Among these is antimony. Although the
world's demand for this metal is not large, this
country uses more of it than does any other, and
is requiring more each year.
Most of the antimony ordinarily comes from Hu-
nan, China, a province noted for its mineral depos-
its. During the Great War, however, when large
quantities of antimony were mixed with lead to
make bullets and when the sulphide went into the
primers to fire the shells and as a powder in smoke
shells, some of the western states opened anti-
mony mines. But ordinarily these mines cannot
produce in competition with foreign suppliers.
One of the largest uses of the silver-white, hard,
brittle metal in this country is to harden and
strengthen the lead sheaths of the cables which the
Western Electric Company manufactures to carry
telephone wires under the streets and on lines of
poles. By making the sheaths ninety-nine parts
lead and one part antimony they are well protected
against breaks and from wear by friction. While
the percentage of antimony is small, it serves the
purpose.
()ther uses for antimony are in cheap tableware,
toys, battery plates and acid-resisting valves, while
antimony oxides are used in glass, enamels, paints,
and in antimie silver finish.
Detector Device Used in War Gets Important
Peace-Time Job
There have been many examples of swords being
more or less literally turned into ploughshares, as
the Biblical phrase puts it, but none more appro-
priate than that of the peace-time adaptation of a
device used in the late World War. During the
years of fighting, when armies burrowed into the
ground and practically hid their artillery from sight,
the Allies found it necessary to bring into service
some new means to locate the sources of the
enemy's fire. To this end, an instrument called an
oscillograph was developed and put to effective use.
The set-up required two microphones which were
placed at some known interval apart in the line to
form two angles of a triangle of which the enemy's
artillery was to form the third. These microphones
were connected to the oscillograph which recorded
the sound arriving at each microphone as a white
line on photographic film in such a way that the
time intervals could be measured, the third angle
computed and the disturbing battery located.
When the United States entered the war, the
Western Electric Company was assigned to make
such "string" oscillographs. A number of these in-
struments were completed and sent to France where
they served their purpose in locating German bat-
teries with such accuracy that they could be de-
stroyed by a few rounds fired from heavy naval
guns.
Then came the Armistice and string oscillographs
along with many other aids to destruction were no
longer needed. However, during the process of
salvaging war materials one of the men who had
been in charge of the manufacture of oscillographs
preserved two complete equipments.
They were to come in handily. For, within a
short time, a new deep sea telegraph cable was de-
veloped by this same company, based on its new
highly magnetic iron-nickel alloy, permalloy, which
made possible cable transmission up to as high as
2,500 letters a minute. In fact, the new cable wa&lt;

so fast that the receiving apparatus with which the
old cables were equipped proved unable to keep up
the pace in the recording end. In an attempt to
correct this—and had they not been successful, the
new cables would have been a failure—the two war-
time oscillographs were pressed into service. They
proved to be almost ideal for the new work laid
out for themn, and were used on the new cable for
two years until worn out. The Bell Telephone Lab-
oratories then redesigned them, increasing their sen-
sitivity about 20 fold and speeding up the work of the
oscillograph camera. Thus, these war-time instru-
ments have become a part of modern, highly effici-
ent communication facilities which, instead of help-
ing in the business of destroying men and nations.
are bringing them closer together.

o
Neir Proccxit for Recorery of Valuable
Mica Waxlex
The recovery of highly valuable mica wastes,
hitherto lost in the ground mica industry due to
incomplete settling of fine materials in the wet
grinding process, is promised as the result of ex-
periments conducted by the United States Bureau
of Mines, Department of Commerce, at its Non-
Metallic Minerals Experiment Station, New Bruns-
wick, X. J. The solution of the problem is indi-
cated in the application of electrolytes as floccu-
lating reagents. As finely-ground mica is a high-
priced product, attaining a value of $100 to $120
per ton, the losses from this source attain propor-
tions that seem to demand a remedy.
In the mining of mica, a considerable tonnage of
material is produced which is so damaged by rump-
ling, folding, the presence of impurities and lack
of size that it cannot be manufactured into sheet
goods, points out W. M. Myers, associate mineral
technologist, in a report just issued by the Bureau
of Mines. In the early days of the mica industry
this material was considered worthless and no effort
was made to recover it. The discover}- that ground
mica produced from this scrap is of value to many
industries has resulted in the profitable disposal of
most of such material now being produced as a by-
product at the mines. The supply of scrap mica
from this source is augmented by the trimmings
produced in the manufacture of sheets; by mica not
suitable for sheet goods produced as a by-product in
the operation of feldspar mines and clay pits ; and by
production from mines which are operated for scrap
alone. This ultilization of scrap mica has been a
benefit to many mines, as it has afforded a source
of additional revenue sufficient to justify the oper-
ation of properties which could not produce sheet
mica alone in quantity having a value great enough
to pay for the cost of production. The market ab-
sorbs from 5.000 to 9,000 tons of mica per year.
The principle of the application of electrolytes
for deflocculation of fine materials in order that im-
purities may settle out, and the subsequent floccu-
lation of the suspended particles by a different re-
agent, is well known and has been applied success-
fully to clays. Flocculation is also applied with
success to ore slimes. Thus certain electrolytes,
particularly alkalies, added to a suspension of col-
loidal particles cause deflocculation so that sus-
pension mav be maintained indefinitely. The addi-
tion of other electrolytes, particularly acids, on the
contrary, produces flocculation, and the particles
are rapidly precipitated from suspension, leaving a
clear liquid above the precipitated mass. Salts of
trivalent elements, such as aluminum, act similarly.
Due to its cheapness, the double sulphate of alu-
minum and potassium, ordinary alum, has been used
extensively for treating clays.
In order to determine the effect of electrolytes on
the flocculation of fine mica, a series of experiments
was conducted at the New Brunswick Station of the
Bureau of Mines. Sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid,
potash alum, aluminum sulphate, and chrome alum
in which the aluminum of ordinary alum is replaced
by trivalent chromium, displayed efficiency as floc-
culators. Choice of a proper flocculator is dependent
upon cost and also upon its effect on the mica, as
reagents injuring the quality of the product would
be undesirable. Sulphuric acid, aluminum sulphate,
and potash alum appeared most suitable.
Neither sulphuric acid nor aluminum salts in
these quantities displayed any injurious effect upon
the quality of the mica. The greater portion of the
electrolyte is removed when the clear liquid is
drawn off from the precipitated mica.
The results of the Bureau of Mines' experiments
represent laboratory tests only, and it is highly
desirable to obtain corroborative evidence at mica
grinding mills. Considering the low cost of the
alum or other electrolyte, the simplicity of the oper-
ation, and the high value of the recoverable min-
eral, the method bears promise of successful com-
mercial application.

the sea of this similar reward.

LESSON NO. 9 FROM
THE BLASTERS' HANDBOOK
WHEN the steam shovel suddenly
strikes a stratum of heavy clay,
hardpan, or shale, how can explosives be
used to keep the yardage up to schedule?
When the excavation is for a foundation
how can you use explosives without weaken-
ing the support for the building? In blast-
ing foundations through rock, how should
dynamite be used to avoid cracking the
rock beyond a certain line? How
should bore holes be loaded, how
placed?
These and a multitude of other
questions, that are not ordinarily
treated in the average engineering
textbook but will most certainly arise when
you're in the field, are completely answered
in The Blasters' Handbook. Each opera-
tion is carefully described and illustrated
with diagrams and photographs. This
book, now standard in many engineering
classrooms, is a digest of field experiences
covering a period of 125 years. There is no
other book like it because no other men

PHILO POWER STATION, PHILO, OHIO, CONSTRUCTED BY THE FOUNDATION COMPANY
WHEN our forefathers built their primitive water wheels to use the power of run-

Nor could the early scientists, who first experimented with electricity, have conceived
of the extensive uses to which it could be put.
In this age of power its advancement has been more and more due to the public
which uses it, and which owns a large part of the securities issued for the erection
and maintenance of the generating plants.
New uses and new users of power are tremendously increasing the demand for the
enlargement of existing stations, and the construction of new ones, both steam and
hydro-electric.
The Foundation Company, in constructing many of these super-power plants, has

ITS THE MAN THAT COUNTS
human element probably plays a
more important part in the making of
explosives than in any other manufacturing
process conducted on a large scale. There
is no machine in the great Hercules plants
that has not a man for its master. Every
motion it makes is watched. The results of
its work are carefully checked. Nothing is
ever taken for granted. No machine is looked
upon as infallible.
For example, in the gelatin packing house
a large machine fills paper cartridges with
"Hercules Gelatin Dynamite. Although this
machine works with almost positive pre-
cision and accuracy, every cartridge which
comes from it is inspected twice to make
certain that it is properly packed. One in-
spection takes place immediately after the
cartridge leaves the machine. Another be*
fore it is finally boxed for shipment.
The men who use Hercules Explosives know
how dependable are the men who make
Hercules Explosives. The Explosives them-
selves tell the story. In metal mine and
stone quarry, at the bottoms of deep riven
and in the hearts of great mountains,
wherever an engineer builds a city sky-
scraper, or a farmer blasts a ditch, Hercules
Explosives live up to the name they bear.

to use
THE cost of crude fuel goes far beyond
its original purchase price. Unloading,
storage, ash removal, spoilage, insur-
ance, tied'up capital — all represent extra
costs you can't overlook.
When you use gas you eliminate these extra
and sizable charges — out go the scavengers
of waste and spoilage.
You have a fuel that affords you the most
modernized type of fuel service. It is de-
livered to your burners in any desired
quantity instantly—its uniform quality and
ease of control bring efficiency to your oper-
ations and profit to your ledgers.

The Kuhlman Electric Co. is the only
builder of Transformers in the state of
Michigan. In the entire country there
are fewer transformer manufacturers of
consequence than you have fingers on
your hands.
The Kuhlman Electric Co. is one of the
Michigan organizations responsible for
the reputation of the state as an impor-
tant industrial center. For more than a
third of a century Kuhlman has special'
ized in the development and building
of transformers. Today its activities are
international in scope.
Engineering students are cordially in-
vited to inspect our plant when in the
vicinity of Bay City. An interesting
visit is assured.

DAILY PRODUCTION CHART
CUTTERS ALONE CAN
MAKE THIS DIFFERENCE
first chart illustrates a healthy pro-
duction. The second shows a production
that is suffering with "sinking spells."
Milling Cutters alone can make this much
difference on the same machine. When in-
ferior, poorly designed cutters are used, they
become dull quickly, power is wasted in nurs-
ing them along, and production suffers.
As the result of years of experience, the
Brown &amp; Sharpe Cutter Department has de-
veloped cutters that stay sharp for long peri-
ods between sharpenings, save power, and
give a steady high production such as that
shown in the first chart.

building the new
disposal plant
'VV 7HEREVER you find construction work in progress, be it an
engineering triumph or a lesser achievement, it is quite prob-
able you will find Koehring Heavy Duty equipment.
One of these typical proiects is the disposal plant at Sioux Falls,
South Dakota, where a Koehring No. 301 Heavy Duty Shovel did
the excavation work and two Koehring Heavy Duty Mixers produced
the re-mixed concrete.
The large view gives a comprehensive idea of the entire plant while
the smaller illustration in the upper left shows the Heavy Duty Shovel
excavating part of the 100,000 yards which were moved on this iob,
The Koehring mixers, shown in the oval inset, turned approximately
sixty carloads of cement, together with proportionate amounts of
sand and crushed stone, into dominant strength concrete.
In thousands of places the story of Koehring equipped iobs is the
same as that in Sioux Falls—Koehring dependability wins.

THE UNIVERSITY
AND THE MANUFACTURER
How the Department of Engineering Research
of the University of Michigan Serves
the Industries of the State
MANUFACTURING errors
are costly because under
quantity production methods they
are often duplicated thousands of
times before discovery.
Adequate research facilities, such
as those provided by the Depart-
ment of Engineering Research of
the University of Michigan, may
be the means of saving your own
business from expensive and avoid-
able mistakes.
A few hundred dollars spent on
investigation, aided by the splen-
did equipment and personnel of
the University, may return its cost
a hundred-fold.
The Department of Engineering
Research does not compete with
commercial laboratories. It is
operated as a genuine helpful
service to Michigan industries.
The University places at the dis-
posal of interested companies and
individuals:The services of trained
workers, special laboratories, com-
plete testing equipment and ex-
ceptional library facilities.
Actual cost of labor and material
plus a nominal service fee, con-
stitutes the only charge. The
University undertakes only such
problems as require fundamental
research and give promise of defin-
ite solution.

No "broken relations"
with their users
Jenkins Valves preserve year-after-year good re-
lations with their users. Time merely serves to
strengthen the ties of many business friendships.
The veteran engineer shown above has long had
Jenkins Valves on his "schedule." He knows
from experience the long-term, low cost service
which the Jenkins Diamond mark stands for,
The real "old-timer," the middle-aged veteran,
and the young engineer—all know Jenkins
Valves. Though one may have "broken in" dur-
ing the late eighties, another at the turn of the
century, and the third only a year ago, the Jenkins
"Diamond" has meant the same thing to each
since the beginning of his career—a valve made
for maximum service, not merely the average.
There are Jenkins Valves in
bronze and in iron, in standard,
medium and extra heavy pat-
terns for practically every valve
requirement,

The Pit
Three feet of concrete—seven of sand—
five more of concrete—all reinforced with
steel—such are the walls of this under-
ground chamber. The roof, a slab of
steel rimmed with girders, is held in
place by great steel wedges.
A military stronghold? No—a test pit at
the Schenectady Works of the General
Electric Company. Here the "test men",
young engineers, most of whom were in
college only last year, help test the rotors
of waterwheel generators for safe opera-
tion under emergency conditions. These
rotors—some as large as 40 feet in diam-
eter—are revolved at double the speed
which will be demanded of them in
normal service.
The pit controls, located in a building
300 feet away, are supplemented by
ingenious listening and visual devices
which give accurate indication of con-
ditions in the pit at any instant.
Such elaborate precautions have been
devised because of the immense size and
power of generating apparatus which is
now being built to answer the general
demand for more electric energy. Scien-
tists and manufacturers are establishing
new standards of electrical production—
building a heritage which will aid the
engineers of to-morrow to increase the
usefulness of electricity far beyond
to-day's limit.
General Electric's record for successful per-
formance of its waterwheel generators is only
one of the things that have given meaning and
value to the G-E monogram, which appears on
all the equipment built by the Company.
