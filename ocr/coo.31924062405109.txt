SOME METHODS OF MAKING HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS
CHAS. Y. DIXON, '87.
Hydrographic surveying is the art of taking and recording informa-
tion pertaining to a body of still or running water for the purpose of
aiding or improving navigation.
Among other things this definition would include the field work
necessary to the making of charts, the establishing of buoys and lights
as aids to navigation, the ascertaining of the velocity and discharge of
streams with regard to the effect upon water levels, the determining of
the nature and amount of sediment carried and deposited by streams,
and the determining of the contour and kind of material of the bottom
of a stream or navigable channel, for the purpose of its improvement.
The manner of making the survey differs according to the object in view
and the accuracy desired, and may be governed partly by the surround-
ings as to the facilities for doing accurate work.
To enter fully into the methods of making surveys for different pur-
poses is more than is intended in this paper, but it is intended to describe
some of the methods used in obtaining data determining the contour of
the bottom of a stream or navigable channel, enabling the amounts of
material above any required depth to be computed with sufficient accur-
acy to govern contracts for improvement. The methods here described
are used on the Detroit river, and have been used on the St. Mary's river
for a number of years where they were improved as the needs required.
U. S. Assistant Engineer, Joseph Ripley, of Sault Ste Marie, Mich., is
largely responsible for the adoption and improvement of these methods,.


THE TECHNIC.
and the information derived from their use is as reliable as may be
obtained.
It is presumed that a system of triangulation has been previously
established, and triangulation or shore stations located conveniently near
to govern the work. Having adjusted the angles and computed the sides
of the triangles, a well determined and centrally located station is
assumed as an origin of co-ordinates, and the rectangular co-ordinates of
all stations computed. This system of co-ordinates and all stations are
then plotted on a map or chart showing that part of the channel of
which it is desired to make an accurate survey. The center line or axis
of the proposed channel is then plotted. This axis of channel is usually
marked by range towers for navigation purposes, and these towers may
be located by transit intersections from two or more triangular stations,
and their co-ordinates computed. Should there be no range towers
marking the course, the axis may be assumed, taking advantage of all
reliable information. This center line may be afterwards shifted if it is
found desirable, to take advantage of deep water or to avoid shoals
which are developed by the survey.
Having- determined the axis of channel, its equation is computed
referred to the system of co-ordinates, and also the equations of lines
parallel to the axis and 50 feet outside of the proposed channel banks.
These lines are placed beyond the channel for the purpose of including
within the survey any material which may be removed on account of
side slopes. Stakes driven on these lines may subsequently be used for
the purpose of locating dredges during the progress of the work of
improvement, and it is desirable to have the stakes marking the channel
«beyond its limits that they may not be disturbed.
The cross-sections along which soundings are taken are normal to
the axis of channel and at equal distances apart, this distance depending
largely upon the nature of the material to be removed. In rock, where
there are liable to be abrupt changes in the bottom, the cross-sections
should be 10 feet apart, and in clay or sand where the bottom is more or
Jess uniform, the sections should be from 20 to 50 feet part. The zero of
cross-sections is selected at one extreme end of the proposed work, and
one of the co-ordinates of its intersection with the axis of channel is
scaled from the lines as plotted, the other co-ordinate being found by
substituting in the equation of the axis. The co-ordinates of the inter-
sections of cross-section zero with the side lines are then obtained, and
subsequently the co-ordinates of the ends of cross-sections, usually 500
feet apart.
The azimuths from two triangulation stations to these ends of cross-
sections are then computed by means of the differences of co-ordinates.
The stations from which azimuths are computed should be selected so
that lines from them to points in the vicinity of the work should inter-
sect forming as near a right angle as possible. As the work progresses
should this angle approach to 30° or 150°, other stations should be
selected forming a more desirable angle. The angle in question is found


3
by obtaining the difference of the azimuth from the stations to the point
at which the angle is subtended. Having computed the azimuths they
should be copied in two note-books, together with the azimuths between
stations, thus enabling the observer at each station to put his instrument
in the meridian.
The note-books for soundings are then arranged,—these note-books
have horizontal and vertical lines intersecting in small squares. The
soundings to be taken 10 feet apart along cross sections are numbered
consecutively at the top of the page and the cross-sections are numbered
consecutively down the page. It has been found desirable to leave blank
every second line in arranging the cross-sections in the note-books, the
intermediate spaces being frequently required for recording other infor-
mation. The note-books should be thus arranged for the whole work,
each sounding required having its proper place, and when obtained
should be there recorded.
The preliminary work in the office being completed, the actual work
of making the survey is carried on either by means of boats or preferably
through the ice during the winter. The equipment necessary for this
work is entirely different in the two cases. If the work should be done
by the use of boats the manner of its prosecution will be as follows:
The hnes of stakes are first driven, and for this purpose the two
observers take their stations, each being provided with an ordinary tran-
sit, a signal flag, and note-book containing azimuths. The party driving
stakes and each observer should receive definite instructions as to the
order of procedure, thus preventing confusion and consequent loss of
time after the work has begun. The party driving stakes is provided
with a small scow carrying a pile driver, the requisite number of good
stakes from 20 to 30 feet long, several buoys and a cutter or large row-
boat. A buoy is first dropped from the cutter marking the position of
the first stake; in order to do this quickly the cutter gets on the line of
one of the observers, which is indicated by his flag being held vertical,
and then follows along his line, either directly towards him or away
from him. until the other observer signals "all right," when the buoy is
thrown overboard. The scow is then towed to this position and anchored,
using three anchors, one leading up stream and one to either side. The
scow is now shifted by overhauling the lines until the pile driver is in
the required position, which is indicated by the flag of each observer
being held vertical. The stake is put in and if each observer still indi-
cates "all right," the signal to drive is given by one of the party on the
scow waving his hat, which signal is repeated by each observer waving
his flag. The stake is not to be driven until each observer has answered
this signal. This process is repeated for each stake, working with the
wind or current. In order readily to distinguish the signals of the
observers, the party driving stakes should be provided with a good pair
of marine glasses.
Having driven the stakes on each line, if passing vessels and log rafts
permit them to remain long enough, the actual work of sounding should


THE TECHNIC.
begin. The party necessary for the prosecution of this work should con-
sist of the chief of party, recorder, leadsman, three or four oarsmen for
the cutter (depending on the strength of current), two small row boats,
each with two men, and one water gauge reader. Two side lines or cork
lines 500 feet long should be provided. These cork lines are made of
window sash cord which has been well stretched and has corks or small
blocks of cedar securely wedged at regular distances apart, marking- the
ends of cross-sections and floating the line. A tag line of a length neces-
sary to reach between the side lines of stakes and with tags every 10 feet
should be provided. This line is strong maitre cord and the tags are red,
white and blue cloth,—the white preferably marking each 50 feet. The
maitre chord should be well stretched for two or three days before being
tagged, and when the tags are put on they should be interwoven with
the strands to prevent slipping. The tag line on being first used usually
stretches and should be retagged. The side lines or cork lines are
stretched between the first two stakes on each line, and the tag line
stretched between the stakes marking the ends of cross-section zero.
The two small row boats take their positions at each end of the tag line
with the anchor (about 50 lbs. weight) of each boat leading astern, each
boat being also provided with a small spar (about 4 ft. long) in the bow
to which the tag line is made fast. The cutter, with the chief of party,
recorder, leadsman and crew, begins at one end of the tag line and the
soundings are taken at each tag across the channel. It is the duty of
the men in the small boats to see that the bow of the cutter, from which
the soundings are taken, keeps on the line, joining the ends of the cross-
section. After sounding each line, the men in the small boats drop
down to the next cork, make it fast to the bow of the boat, and overhaul
the anchor line until the end of the tag line is along tha line of stakes.
This operation is repeated throughout the work, it usually being neces-
sary to shift the anchors of the side boats to three positions between
each two stakes. The time of beginning- and ending of each lino of
soundings should also be recorded.
This method of taking the soundings is used where the cross-sections
are at greater distances apart than 10 feet. Where the material is rock,
and it is necessary to take the cross-sections 10 feet apart, a strong cur-
rent is usually to be met with, which renders it difficult to do accurate
work from a boat. Under these circumstances the soundings are usually
taken from a raft, constructed of squared timbers, 130 feet long and 20
feet wide. The raft should be provided with a swinging anchor (about
75 lbs. weight) which may be required to be backed by a smaller anchor,
from 1,500 to 2,000 feet of swinging line, and four side anchors (about 50
lbs. weight) with lines, one at each corner of the raft. In this caee the
stakes on the side lines should be 260 feet apart, or twice the length of
the raft, and the tag lines (of which two are required) should be tagged
every 30 feet, the tags being large enough to be readily distinguished
for a distance of 260 feet.
The swinging anchor is dropped in the middle of either half of the


channel three or four hundred feet above the first position of the raft,
and the side anchors placed in position. The raft is then hauled to its
position,—the outer edge of the raft being along the line of stakes and
the upper end under the tag line between the stakes at the up-stream
end of the work. The soundings are then taken by three leadsmen with
sounding poles at every 10 feet along each edge and through the middle
of the raft. The soundings being taken for one position, the raft is
hauled to a new position, the up-stream end being still under the tag
line and the outer edge in line with the first tag on each cross-line. The
soundings are again taken as before and this operation repeated to the
center line of channel, care being taken to keep the up-stream end of
the raft under the tag line by overhauling the swinging line. When the
center line of channel is reached, the swinging line is payed out until
the down-stream end of the raft is under the tag line between the two
second stakes on each line, and the side anchors shifted to hold the raft
in its new position. The soundings are taken in the same manner as
before, beginning at the center line, until the side line is reached. This
operation is repeated until the length of the swinging line demands a
new position of the anchor, one-half of the channel being sounded at a
time.
The raft used in making this survey is provided with iron bars sus-
pended by chains from windlasses throughout its full length, and is
ordinarily used in connection with the work of improvement for the pur-
pose of locating- boulders or other obstructions in the.channel, the bars
being set at any required depth. When the survey is in progress these
bars are usually lowered and material is thus found which would not be
indicated by the surroundings,—the proper record being kept in connec-
tion with the record of soundings. When soundings are taken in a navi-
gable channel during the season of navigation there is much delay
caused by the taking up of cross-lines to permit the passing of vessels
and thus greatly increasing the cost of the work. For this reason, and
in consideration of the fact that soundings taken through the ice are
generally more accurate, ice surveys should be made where it is possible,
the examination for boulders with the raft being made either before or
after.
When the soundings are taken through the ice, stakes at regular
distances along the side lines, which are set in the ice by transit inter-
sections, side lines and cross-lines with tags marking the ends of cross-
sections and soundings, are used as described in the first method, with
such modifications as are necessary on account of the work being on the
ice. The places at which it is desired to take the soundings are marked
by the stroke of an axe in the ice or snow underneath the tags. The
holes in the ice through which the soundings are taken are made by
boring machines resting on runners, which are easily moved about on
the ice. Two men are necessary for the proper handling of each
machine. During the past winter when surveys were being made at
the mouth of the Detroit river, it was found that with ice one foot in


THE TECHNIC.
thickness and with little or no snow to impede the running of the
sleighs, 83 holes in each line were bored in an average time of about 23
minutes. This result agrees with the experience of previous winters
under like conditions. A greater thickness of ice would not add much
to the time of doing the work, as the time is principally taken up in
moving the machine and in getting in position for the next hole.
In taking the soundings for depths less than 15 feet a sounding pole
may be used to advantage, but for greater depths it is more expeditious
and just as accurate to use the sounding reel. This device is a wheel 10
ft. in circumference, graduated on its rim in feet and tenths. Upon this
wheel is wound a fine wire with sounding lead (usually 7 lbs.) attached,
the wire being of sufficient length to take the soundings of greatest
depth. This wheel, together with the necessary framework, is mounted
on a sleigh which may be easily moved by one man. When the lead
touches the surface of the water in lowering, a dial is set at the zero of
graduation on the rim of the wheel, and the lead is held for an instant
at the water surface at each sounding to check the position of the dial.
It will be found necessary frequently to shift the position of the dial
when working over uneven ice. In taking the soundings each turn of
the wheel indicates 10 feet to which is to be added the reading in feet
and tenths as given on the rim of the wheel.
The use of ice-boring machines and sounding reels in making these
surveys has been found to be a great improvement on the old Way with
axes and sounding poles, both as to economy and comfort of men. Since
the men may keep dry the work may be carried on during the coldest of
weather. The machinery used in doing this work was designed and
improved in connection with the work of improving St. Mary's river,
Mich., where it has been in use for several years.
As a comparison of the different methods of making surveys it has
been found that the cost of work done on the ice is from one-half to two-
thirds of the cost of the same work if done from boats, taking account
of the expense of staking out the work as a part of the cost.
In whatever manner the work is done, either from boats or through
the ice, water gauge readings are taken while the work of sounding is in
progress. The water gauges to be used should be established along
shore in sheltered places previous to the beginning of the survey. The
zeros of the water gauges should be at such elevations as to give, as
nearly as possible, the same reading at the same time. This is accom-
plished by taking simultaneous readings at the different gauges on
several days during calm weather, and at different stages of water if
possible. The means of these readings are taken for each gauge and the
means for the different gauges compared. The zeros of the gauges are
then taken at such elevations as will make the readings agree. The ele-
vation of the zero of gauge is usually taken at the mean stage of water
for a given period. If these water gauges should be along the bank of a
river, the difference in elevation of the zeros will indicate the slope of
the river, and it is known from observations that this slope varies with


7
the stage of water, and direction and force of wind. It will thus be
seen that the gauges cannot be established so as to give the same read-
ings at all times. The best that can be done is by frequent observations
to get a mean under normal conditions. Having established the gauges
their zeros should be referred to convenient bench marks ashore, and
these bench marks and water gauges connected by a line of levels with
a bench mark whose elevation above mean tide is known. If there
should be no such bench mark conveniently near, the datum plane may
be assumed. This is quite necessary for purposes of reference.
When taking water gauge readings in connection with the survey it
is frequently necessary to put in a temporary gauge. For this purpose
a nail is driven horizontally into a pile or stake driven firmly into the
ground in 2.5 ft. to 3.0 ft. of water. The head of the nail should project
about i in. from the pile or stake, and should be set at the elevation of
the zero of gauge by level readings from the bench mark ashore. The
elevation of this nail should frequently be checked during the progress
of the work to make.sure that it has not changed. This should be done
each day, and especially is it necessary if the stake is driven through a
hole in the ice.
The duty of the water gauge observer is to measure and record in a
book for that purpose the distance from the zero of the gauge to the
water surface every 15 minutes, affixing the proper sign to the reading
(— if the water surface is below zero, and -+- if above zero), making note
also at the time of each reading of the direction and force of wind and
state of the weather. It is also the duty of the observer to take proper
care of the gauge that it may not be disturbed. The importance of
checking the elevation of the zero of the gauge and keeping a full and
accurate record of the reading cannot be overestimated, as the water
surface frequently changes from 0.5 to 1.0 ft. during a day even in com-
paratively calm weather, and it is necessary to have complete informa-
tion regarding these changes in order that the correction to the sound-
ings may be applied intelligently. The observer should also frequently
compare his time piece with that of the recorder and cause them to agree.
After the field work of making the survey has been completed, the
soundings are reduced to the zero of the gauge. The correction to be
applied to the soundings is obtained by taking the difference between the
elevations of the water surface at the time of sounding and the zero of
the gauge, due attention being given to the sign of correction. For this
purpose the recorder should keep a complete record of the time of sound-
ing, the time being recorded at the beginning- and end of each line and
also in the middle of a line should there be any unusual delay. The
reduced soundings are plotted on tracing linen to any convenient scale,
and from these reduced soundings the amount of material above the
required depth is computed.
After the soundings have been taken borings are made at different
places to determine the kind of material. The positions of these borings
should be selected after a thorough inspection of the soundings,—all


THE TECHNIC.
places in which rock might be expected being thoroughly tested. The
drill making the borings should be located by transit intersections, and
the positions of borings and description of the kind of material should
be given on the sounding sheets. This information should be made as
complete as possible.
It has been found that the information resulting from thorough
examinations made in this way, together with that derived from the
raft sweeping and sounding, materially affects the bids of contractors in
competing for the work of removing the material, as much of the uncer-
tainty which usually attends such work has been removed.
STRAIGHTENING A LEANING CHIMNEY.
O. L. E. WEBER, '93.
Among the different methods employed for straightening leaning
chimneys instances are recorded in which tall brick chimneys have been
brought from a leaning to a vertical position in a day's time, with
entirely satisfactory results. Though many of these examples are
admirable for the boldness of ideas and necessary courage in undertaking,
yet the hazard to life, property and reputation from a possible failure
usually suggests safer though longer methods of accomplishing the same
results.
With a secure foundation, probably one of the simplest, most suc-
cessful and common methods of straightening leaning chimneys is that
of sawing the mortar joints.
An example of this kind came to the writer's notice a short time
ago, and a description of the work may possibly be of interest to some of
the readers of the TECHNIC.
The chimney is one belonging to the mill of the Michigan Sulphite
Fibre Company, located at Port Huron, Mich., on the north bank of the
Black River and about one and one half miles from St. Clair River. It is
square in section up to 30 feet above the base and then octagonal to the
top, measuring 121 feet at the base and 9 feet across the octagon at top.
It is 110 feet high and has an average flue area of 47 square feet.
The weight of the chimney is estimated at 665 tons. The foundation
is 5 feet deep and consists of a lower course of concrete, square in plan
and covering an area of 289 square feet, with upper courses of stone.
The weight of the foundation is estimated at 82 tons. Total estimated
weight of chimney and foundation 747 tons or about 2.58 tons per square
foot of foundation. The soil upon which the chimney was built is sand
to a depth of fifteen feet overlaying a sub-soil of heavy blue clay. The
bottom of the foundation is about eleven feet above the highest level of
the river
The chimney was built in the summer of 1888, and about one year


9
after it was completed a slight leaning1 towards the south-west was
noticed, and the inclination gradually increased until the summer of 1894
when it was 2 feet llf inches out of plumb.
Mr. R. E. Raseman, architect, of Detroit, Mich., made an examina-
tion of the structure, foundation and surrounding soil, and the work of
straightening the chimney was done under his supervision.
It was decided that it would not be necessary to do any work on or
under the foundation as the seemed to be equally compressed under all
sides of the foundation and no further leaning of the chimney due to
settlement was expected.
A scaffold was erected around the chimney to a height of 45 feet and
on this four platforms were" built about 7 feet apart, leaving sufficient
room for men to work between. The lowest platform was about 16 feet
above the ground. About 3 feet above the platforms the chimney was
tightly wound with telegraph wire, forming bands as shown on the illus-
tration.* The ends of the wire were securely fastened and wooden wedges
driven between the wire and the flat sides of the chimney to obtain a
greater and more equal pressure against the brickwork. The object of
the bands was to hold the chimney intact during the process of straight-
ening, as a crack about eight feet long had made its appearance on the
leaning side of the chimney. An iron rod was then fixed across the top
of the chimney at right angles to the direction in which the chimney
leaned and a plumb bob suspended from the rod, from which observa-
tions were taken as the work of straightening progressed.
A cut was then started just below the lowest wire band on the north-
east or high side of the chimney with an ordinary ship-carpenter's saw,
but the teeth wore down in a very short time and the progress became
so slow that the saws were laid aside as useless. A piece of soft iron was
then tried for a saw. It was made 14 feet long, 4 inches wide, and i
inch thick, and nicked on the \ inch side at distances about one inch
apart, to form a cutting edge. Holes were punched near the ends of the
bar through which iron bars were put for handles.
With two men at each end of this saw the cut was again started.
The teeth or nicks on the iron bar also lasted for a short time, but it was
found that the saw worked fully as well without the teeth, as the silica
in the mortar imbedded itself into the soft iron and formed a rough
-cutting edge similar to that in a stone cutter's saw. This cut was
continued through the entire brickwork past the center of gravity and
to within about three feet from the opposite or low side. As the cut
proceeded, iron wedges were driven in directly back of the saw to free
it from the settling brickwork and the chimney seemed to adapt itself to
its new position without any perceptible movement.
The saw was then drawn out and another cut started on the same
joint and continued to about the middle of the chimney. As the second
out commenced to close up the joint was flushed with a slow setting
•See frontispiece.


THE TECHNIC.
cement. Two similar cuts were then taken below the second band and
flushed with cement as before. In making- the final cut under the third
band, the width of the cut and the position of the chimney were care-
fulty noted and the saw started on a new cut several times during its
progress across the chimney in order to get the required width of opening-
to bring the chimney to position.
Due to the difference in level between the joints of the outer and
inner chimney and the sag in the saw, a number of bricks were loosened
from the inner chimney. These were cemented and wedged into place
as often as it was thought necessary by men on the inside of the
chimney.
It will be seen that the object of making the cuts in several places
was to avoid the broken appearance the chimney would present if the
cuts had all been taken from the same place.
The work was completed by six men in two weeks' time, at a cost of
about two hundred dollars.
As far as can be detected in a rough examination, the chimney has
not altered its position since it was straightened, and a swaying or
rocking motion can be noticed during a high wind.
The illustration represents the chimney as photographed on March
15th, 1897. The view is from the east side, it being impossible to obtain
a photograph from the south-east, or at right angles to the direction in
which it leaned, on account of the surrounding buildings.
CONSTRUCTION OF LITTLE CALUMET RIVER BRIDGE.
BENJ. DOUGLAS, '82, ENGINEER IN BRIDGE DEPT., M. C. R. R.
The Little Calumet is a river crossing the main line of the Michigan
Central Railroad about two and one-half miles west of Lake Station. At
this point it flows in a crooked channel through a wide, marshy flat.
This was formerly crossed by the railroad on a long pile trestle, part of
which was subsequently filled, leaving a trestle 160 feet long over the
main channel of the river, one 89 feet long about one thousand feet west
of it, and another 90 feet long about the same distance east.
In 1896 the two side trestles were filled, and there was substituted
for the main trestle a bridge having three spans each about 55 feet
in the clear. As the distance from base of rail to the bottom of the
superstructure was greater in the new than in the old bridge, and the
water had been nearly up to the stringers of the old, the track was raised
15 inches when the new bridge was built, in order to bring the bottom
of the girders as high as the underside of the old stringers.
The substructure of this bridge consists of two masonry piers and
abutments supported by piles. The piers of the new bridge were built
between the bents of the old trestle without disturbing it in any way.


11
The new bridge being- somewhat longer than the old, the abutments
were located back of the end bents of the trestle. In order to build the
abutments, the trestle was lengthened 31 feet at each end by driving
two pile bents, one 18 feet beyond the old end bents, and just clear of the
back of the abutment, and the other 13 feet further back. A standard
floor was put on these bents. The piles are Norway pine, 10 inches in
diameter at the small end, driven 35 feet below the top of the rail of
the old bridge, and about 19 feet below the bed of the stream. Those in
the wings of the abutments were driven with a common land driver,
with a steam hoisting engine to raise the hammer. The rest of the piles
were driven with a track driver having a 3,500 pound hammer, falling
about 35 feet at the last blow. The penetration of the piles driven with
the track driver was about 4 inches at the last blow. Maximum load on
each pile is about 28,000 pounds, 11,000 pounds of this being live load.
Piles 5 feet shorter than these were used in the old trestle without settle-
ment, the maximum load on each pile being about 25,000 pounds, nearly
all of it live load repeated many times each day.
After the piles were driven, cofferdams were built around the piers
and abutments, those around the piers being made of Wakefield triple
lap sheet piling where the water was deepest, and of two lines of 2 inch
plank where there was not very much water. Waling strips of 12" by
12" timber were used to hold the sheet piling in line. All sheet piling
was driven a little below the bottom of the excavation and well braced
to prevent its crowding in. As the water was at no time during the
construction ot the substructure much above the surface of the ground
at the abutments, a single line of 2 inch plank was used there for sheet
piling, a small bank of earth being thrown up outside of it to keep out
the water. No special trouble was experienced with any of the coffer-
dams, although, in consequence of an unusually large rainfall last sum-
mer, the water in the river was 2 or 3 feet higher than had been antici-
pated. Water was kept out of the pits with a centrifugal pump driven
by a steam threshing engine.
After the pits had been excavated the piles were cut off 16 feet 8
inches below the base of rail of the new bridge, the bottom of the exca-
vation being 6 inches lower. Concrete was then deposited from the bot-
tom of the excavation to 30 inches above the tops of the piles, no caps or
grillage being glaced on the piles. Above the concrete the piers were
constructed of ashlar masonry, made of Berea sandstone, surmounted by
a bed of Portland cement mortar 6 inches thick, composed of 1 part
cement to 2 parts sand, and having imbedded in it 4 lines of 1J inch
square steel rods laid longitudinally, and 5 lines of 1 inch square rods laid
transversely. This bed of mortar was used to bind the top of the masonry
and prevent open joints, for which purpose it has been successfully used
in other bridges. The abutments above the concrete base are made with
ashlar faces of Berea stone, with concrete backing, care having been
taken to thoroughly bind the concrete to the facing with numerous
headers. The bridge seats consist of Berea stone extending across the


THE TECHNIC.
wall and surmounted by a bed of mortar similar to that used on the
piers. The retaining walls above the bridge seats are concrete. Con-
crete backing of abutments consists of 1 part natural cement, 2 parts
sand and 4 parts broken stone. All other concrete, except the 6 inch
course on the bridge seats, consists of 1 part Portland cement, 3 parts
sand and 5 parts broken stone. Broken stone was required to pass
through a 2 inch ring except that used above the bridge seats for which
1 inch stone was specified. Mortar for ashlar masonry was composed of
1 part Portland cement to 3 parts sand.
All stone in ashlar masonry were well moistened just before being
set, and laid with \" joints. Concrete was mixed by hand in the usual
manner. Sand and cement were first mixed dry on a wooden platform,
water being added after they had been thoroughly mixed. The proper
amount of stone was then added, and the whole turned over with shovels
until the mixture was satisfactory. The stones were moistened just
before they were mixed with the mortar Concrete was deposited with
shovels, care being taken to prevent separation of the stone from the
cement. Plank molds were used to keep concrete in place until it was
set.
Stone-cutting was done in a yard on the south side of the railroad
tracks, about 250 feet from the east end of the bridge, derricks being
used to handle the stone. A track was laid from there across the river
to the west abutment. As the stone were dressed, they were loaded on
a push car and run to the pier or abutment in which they were to be
used, or to a derrick at the east end of the bridge where they were
unloaded and stored until wanted. It was found more convenient to
have them stored close to the bridge than at the stone yard.
Stone were set with a Tale &amp; Towne Duplex block of 3£ tons capacity,
hung from a trolley carried by a car of special design. The car was
made wide enough to run on rails placed on light bents, one on each side
of the pier or abutment, and had a transverse track in its center for the
trolley. As the car could be moved lengthwise of the pier, and the
trolley crosswise, the block could be brought over any point of the
masonry. A stone having been brought on the push car to the end of
the masonry, the car carrying the block was run over the stone, which
was raised from the push car with the block, run over the proper point,
and lowered to its final position. The coping stones were so near the
bottom of the stringers of the old bridge that they could not be set by
this method. They were run from the push car on wooden rollers, 3 or 4
inches in diameter, running on the course below the coping, and set with
steel bars.
The superstructure consists of 3 lines of through plate girders,
spaced 14 feet apart, and supporting a ballast floor. The upper part of
this floor consists of plates $ inch thick, 13 feet 3J inches long, and 4 to 5
feet wide. These are placed so as to form a flat horizontal surface
between each pair of girders 13 feet 3i inches wide, and extending the
whole length of the bridge. Along each edge of this, just clear of the


13
stiffening angles of the girders, are 12 inch channels, the whole forming
a trough 12 inches deep and 12 feet 9 inches wide, which is filled with
gravel ballast in which common track ties are bedded. Drainage is pro-
vided through 2 lines of holes in the | inch plates. Under the plates and
supporting them, are 15 inch I-beams, spaced 12 inches apart, resting on
shelf angles, 5 by 8 by $ inches riveted to the webs of the girders just
above their bottom flange angles. In order to prevent contact between
the | inch plate and the ballast, the upper surface of the plate was
coated with "byerlyte." This is a residual product of the refining of
petroleum, somewhat resembling asphalt While probably less durable
than the best asphalt, it is cheaper and much less affected by changes of
temperature. Before applying it, the plate was heated by fires suspended
beneath the girders, the heat being retained by a border of heavy cotton
cloth 3 feet wide, suspended from the edges of the space to be heated.
The melted byerlyte was poured over the surface of the plates, from
common watering pots, so as to form a uniform coating about i inch
thick. As the byerlyte was applied, clean screened roofing gravel was
thrown on it in sufficient quantity to cover the rivet heads. While the
gravel was still warm, byerlyte was poured on it, filling all interstices,
and completing a waterproof coating that should thoroughly protect the
metal from corrosion. The inner faces of the side channels were also
coated with byerlyte to protect them from corrosion. This type of bal-
last floor was preferred to the ordinary types because it can be more
efficiently protected from corrosion, and because the I-beams forming
the support are exposed to view and cannot come in contact with the
ballast. Consequently the floor is not liable to be weakened by corro-
sion, with the probability that such weakening will be undiscovered
before it 1ias become dangerous.
In designing the girders their strength was computed from their
moments of inertia and not merely from their flange areas. Web
splices were designed to resist both shearing and bending stresses. The
center girders would be considerably lighter if they were deeper, but it
was not considered advisable to increase their depth without spread-
ing the tracks farther apart than they now are, with a resulting
increase in cost of floor and substructure greater than the saving in the
girders.
The pedestals are cast iron designed so that the bearings of the
girders are only 8 inches long. Such short bearings were provided in
order to insure a fairly even distribution of pressure on the masonry.
In consequence of them, the pedestals extend beyond the girders, recesses
being left in the masonry of the abutments to admit the projection.
Except the cast pedestals, all metal in the superstructure is basic
open hearth steel having an ultimate strength between 57,000 and 66,000
pounds per square inch, a minimum elastic limit 55 per cent. of its ulti-
mate strength, reduction of area 43 per cent., elongation varying from
26 per cent, for 57,000 pounds steel to 23 per cent, for 66,000 pounds steel,
and maximum percentage of phosphorus T%t.


THE TECHNIC.
Bearings on the west pier ase fixed. Those on the east pier and both
abutments have expansion rollers. The rollers are incased to prevent
dirt clogging them.
At the ends of the bridge it was necessary to break the continuity of
the ballast in order to allow free movements of the superstructure with
changes of temperature. This was accomplished by placing on top of
the -J inch plate, and directly over the end I-beams of the floor, 4 10-inch
I-beams having riveted to their top flanges 12 by -J inch plates that
extend beyond the girders over the top of the masonry, which has been
built to the level of their under sides.
In order to avoid placing ties on the masonry or leaving objection-
ably large spaces between the end ties of the bridge and the first ties off
of it, recesses were made in the masonry, each of them extending 5 feet
either side of the center line of the track, having its bottom 12 inches
below the top of the tie, and its front edge 6 inches from the face of the
masonry. They are open at the back. In the ballast of these recesses
the first ties beyond the ends of the superstructure are bedded. As the
masonry in front of these recesses is but 6 inches thick, scrap rails about
12 feet long are bedded in it to prevent cracking.
The superstructure was erected on false-work placed alongside the
old bridge on the north (down stream) side. For moving it from there
to its final position, tracks were laid on the false bents supporting the
ends of the girders and along the copings of the masonry. These con-
sisted of 3 lines of 65 pounds rails at the piers, and 2 lines at the abut-
ments. Inverted rails were placed under the girders and directly over
those of the tracks below. Between these inverted rails and the tracks
were placed iron rollers 3 inches in diameter and 12 inches long, made of
common bar iron, not turned.
After the erection at the side was completed, the old trestle was
torn out. The ties were carried ashore, the stringers rolled off the pile
bents on the up-stream side, and the caps rolled off the piles and dropped
into the stream under the bridge. The piles being below the new girders
were not cut until later. As soon as this work was completed, the
superstructure of the new bridge was pulled into its final position, the
power used being a steam hoisting engine working triple blocks attached
to the center of the bridge; and a hand winch at each end working double
blocks. Before the superstructure was moved, tracks were la'd on it,
with just enough ballast to hold the ties at their proper elevation. As
soon as the moving was completed, the rails of these tracks were con-
nected with those at the ends. Trains could then have crossed the bridge
if the work of raising the tracks on the bank at each end had been com-
pleted. No record was made of the time occupied in making the change.
Tearing out the old trestle commenced about 7:15 A. M. and the first
regular train crossed the bridge about 11:45 A. M., a work train having
crossed about half an hour before. Moving the girders took about fifteen
minutes, and connecting the rails about as much more. Tearing out the
old trestle and raising track took the remainder of the time.


All work done prior to the change from the old bridge to the new
was done without the slightest interruption of traffic, or disturbing the
old bridge in any way except by shifting the ties a little to enable piles
to be driven between them. After the change to the new bridge had
been made, trains were required to reduce speed to ten miles per hour
until the track had been properly surfaced where it was raised. Except
for this, and the time occupied in making the change, the bridge was
constructed without any interference with traffic. While piles were
being driven with the track driver, a telegraph operator was kept at the
bridge, to receive orders from the train dispatcher to the crew of the
driver. Two short tracks were provided, one leading out from each of
the main tracks. The driver was kept on one of these tracks except
when permission was given to occupy one of the main tracks.
Work on the foundations was commenced on June 6th, 1896. The
foundation for the west abutment was completed about July 1st. All
work on foundations was completed on July 18th. The masons com-
menced work on June 29th and finished on August 20th, except the con-
crete walls above the copings of the abutments. These were constructed
after the superstructure was in place. The erection of the superstruc-
ture was commenced on September 5th and completed October 22nd.
During two weeks of the interval between the commencement and com-
pletion of the erection the erecting gang was employed at another
bridge, because of delay in receiving material for Little Calumet. No
special effort was made to hurry the work of construction.

The cost of the concreting was greater than it would ordinarily b&amp;
because the crushed stone was unloaded all at one end of the bridge and
about 300 feet away. The labor cost given for all work includes cost of
moving, wages of foreman, cost of loading and unloading tools and
material, setting up and operating derricks, etc. Items of this character
constitute from 10 to 20 per cent, of the totals.
All work at the bridge site was done by employees of the Michigan
Central Railroad Co. The ironwork for the superstructure was bought
of the Detroit Bridge and Iron Works. All drawings, including shop
drawings of the superstructure, were made by the Railroad Company.

ELECTRICAL PLANTS FOR SMALL TOWNS.*
ALEXANDER DOW.
There are several standpoiats from, which an engineer may regard
the problems incident to the construction and operation of an electric
lighting plant. The first is an ideal standpoint—that of the engineer
who has but to select or advise a method or an expense to have his views
adopted and the necessary capital supplied. It is the lot of very few
engineers to find themselves in this position. Perhaps the nearest
approach to it is made by the special engineers of a few great corpora-
tions whose directors, after giving their best thought to the selection of
an engineer, leave him free to do the work he is engaged for. The cap-
able man who finds himself so placed knows that he has great responsi-
bilities as well as great opportunities; and though he is not likely to be
called by others to discuss his plans, he himself will surely be a most
unmerciful critic.
The second position is that of the engineer employed by the owner
of a plant to design and erect it. His investigations and calculations
must be as wide and as perfect as those of the engineer of the first class,
but his conclusions are often different because of the limited capital
available for investment and because of preconceived ideas of his
employer. Of course it is always the engineer's duty to hold down the
amount of capital invested to the figure on which a reasonable profit can
be returned. But it will often be his duty to reduce the investment
below the most profitable figure because the owner cannot or will not
furnish the money required by the calculations. In this case the run-
ning expenses of the plant will be higher and the percentage of profit
less. In the matter of preconceived ideas it is the engineer's duty to
seek a modification of 1;hese ideas, but it is not his duty to insist against
the set opinions of the investor. A man is entitled to say how his money
shall be spent and it is the nature of most men to be happy when they
are having their own way.
It is not the duty of the engineer to assume responsibility for work
that will be injurious to his own reputation, even when he carries out
the work under protest. He is himself the judge as to how far he can
go in any direction without harm to himself. Generally speaking the
differences between investor and engineer are on matters of detail and
not likely to involve the reputation of the latter.
The third point of view for the engineer is that occupied by the esti-
mating and constructing engineer of an electrical manufacturing or con-
struction company. His duties to the owner of the plant are limited by
the spirit of the specifications and contract under which the plant is

THE TECHNIC.
installed. He is usually responsible only for a guaranteed efficiency of
the plant—efficiency of transformation of energy, that is—and not at all
for its earning capacity as an investment. These two terms are not
interchangeable. I know that in the minds of most engineering stu-
dents the one implies the other, but in truth there are many inefficient
plants which earn a great deal of money for their owners and there are
many plants highly efficient which are financial failures. Your duties
as the engineer of the construction company will end with the test and
acceptance. You will find yourselves many times called on to install
alternating current plants when you know direct current would be pre-
ferable, and to erect circuits which although in excellent shape as they
leave your hands will infallibly become unbalanced and troublesome in
the hands of the purchaser within a few months. These matters are the
purchaser's affairs—not yours. "Caveat emptor "—let the buyer beware
—is good sense as well as good law. And so long as purchasing commit-
tees and "enterprising merchants" and "leading local electricians"
will, after study of advertising matter furnished them by would-be
sellers of goods, and after inspection of a few installations, insist on
decidiug engineering questions without professional advice—just so long
will it be necessary for these people to suffer for their presumption.
The first rule for the engineer is that a comprehensive study should
be made of the environment. Naturally one will obtain data of the lines
of distribution, location of the component parts of the load, and the
nature of the load; also some attention will be paid to the character of
the fuel to be burned and to the cost of fuel and labor. Lord Kelvin's
formula for the relation of investment in copper to amount of energy
expended in the copper, is well known and his original equation has been
developed into more elaborate forms than ever were contemplated by its
author. In its simplest form it requires a knowledge of the data men-
tioned. But I warn you that I know no formula that can be depended
on in every case either as including all the necessary factors entering
into the construction and operation of a plant, so that no factor may be
overlooked; or as giving to each factor its proper place in the equation.
The conditions vary so much between localities, and between meth-
ods that no generalization from a number of cases can be depended on as
a guide for any new case. This saying holds good with operating costs
as well as with the elements of design, and there are no figures so tho-
roughly misleading as those which well-meaning theorists have devel-
oped from the published costs of operation of the different municipal
lighting plants throughout the country. Of course comparisons must
be made, but they should be made item by item with the similar items
of similar plants and not with averages struck from a number of dis-
similar.
There is very little knowledge as to local manufacturing and social
conditions that will not prove useful in the design of a central station.
The manufacturing conditions such as costs and nature of fuel, water
and labor, affect the production costs and the social conditions of the


19
city regulate the market for the product. There are some towns in this
country where a central station is a predestined failure no matter how
well engineered or how economically operated, because the social life of
the people has not yet reached its development in the kerosene state.
I do not speak of kerosene contemptuously because I would rather be a
manager of a new lighting plant in a town where the competition came
from an average gas company than in another town where three or four
hardware dealers were pushing the modern kerosene lamps. Then there
are towns where any kind of a lighting plant will make money, and will
have to be extended within a year. But these considerations are rather
for the inventor and the electric light promotor than for the engineer.
I call your attention to some of the details that are too frequently
overlooked. One is the water supply, in reference to the class of boilers
which should be used. There are districts where the type of the boiler
has to be settled by convenience of cleaning without reference to the
results to be obtained from the fuel, and there are other districts where
economy must be regarded and purification of the water undertaken
before it can be fed to the boilers. As instances in point, I would point
out to the perpetuation of two flue boilers on and near the lower Missis-
sippi and its tributaries, and as an instance of necessity of purification I
refer to the salt well districts of our own State and of New York State,
where the water is loaded with lime sulphates.
I call your attention also to the necessity of studying not only the
cost of the help to be obtained but the capabilities and the practical edu-
cation of that help. You will find that in each district some type of
engine is the favorite with the majority of steam users, that engineers
skilled in the operation of that type of engine are to be had without
difficulty, and that machinists capable of skilfully adjusting- and repair-
ing it are established in business. This consideration will decide as
between the favored type and the other one which might be more
economical or less expensive. For cases in point I refer to the different
flour milling districts throughout the west, where you will find the Cor-
liss engine firmly established in the confidence of users and where you
will find skilled Corliss engineers and repair men in every small town.
Again, in the lake ports there is no lack of good marine engineers to
whom the peculiarities of 150 to 180 lbs. staam pressure are familiar and
in whose hands engines of a modified marine type will give better results
than will the Corliss engine with customary steam pressure. The first
cost of the marine engine is in its favor, as also is its adaptability to
medium rotative speeds—say up to 200 revolutions per minute. Take
again the newer mining districts and the saw mills which are established
in a forest which promises only 5 or 10 years cut of lumber. In these
locations you will find only the most primitive appliances for repairs, a
pretty general disregard for the risks attending the use of high steam
pressures and a demand for rough and reliable machinery which will
stand hard knocks and careless handling without breaking down. Also
you will find that the saw mill owner has more fuel in the shape of slabs


THE TECHNIC.
and saw dust than he knows how to dispose of, and that in his case cer-
tainly and possibly also in that of the pioneer miner, fuel economy is of
little importance. The second state of the mining region when its devel-
opment has been undertaken by organized capital, is entirely different
from the pioneer state; for there is no country in the world where finer
steam machinery is to be found or where more attention is paid to the
maintenance of apparatus and to fuel economy than in the Northern
Peninsula of Michigan. The call of owners in that district is for the
best apparatus. One other point should not be forgotten when help is
considered. That is, the supply of unskilled labor. I have indicated
elsewhere that this item is of importance in the construction of the
plant. I wish now to point out that it is of importance in the operation,
and that a lack of coal passers and boiler room helpers may shut down a
plant just as effectively as a lack of skilled engineers and electricians.
I always consider the question of the use of mechanical coal handling in
this connection, preferring where costs are equal, to employ hand stok-
ing, but where costs are much in favor of mechanical stoking and con-
veying machinery, and particularly when unskilled labor is unreliable or
troublesome, to install the more complicated apparatus.
If you are in the position of constructing engineer for a contractor,
you should study carefully the terms of the contract and specifications.
If the contract guarantees a certain operating economy, your duties will
require much the same study as if you were engineer for the purchaser.
If, on the other hand, the guarantees are only on efficiency of steam and
electrical apparatus, you have only a very small part of the ground to
cover, and the adaptation of plant to operating conditions of a general
character may be left for the owner or his advisers.
In the most frequent case, namely, where guarantees of efficiency
are involved but no broad operating guarantee, you may transfer the
responsibility for fulfilment of pledges to the different manufacturers
whose apparatus you install and devote your attention solely to reducing
construction costs. I advise a careful inquiry as to the labor available,
both skilled and unskilled. Remember that the diggers of ditches and
post holes, and the men who furnish the main strength and awkward-
ness which is the motive power on jack-screws and lifting tackle\ draw a
large proportion of the construction pay-roll, and that there is in a small
town seldom a surplus sufficient to construct an extensive public work.
If pour operations coincide in time with the harvest in the prairie States,
or with the log drive in the lumber States, you may find yourselves
driven to import your labor from a long distance, which is not only an
expensive proceeding but gives grave offence to the local labor.
Another item which is always important in electric light construc-
tion is the nature of the soil. I have twice been embarrassed by false
reports on this subject, the circumstances in each case being that I
could neither personally nor by competent assistants make the examina-
tion, and that the report brought in by the salesman was based on insuf-
ficient inquiry. In the one case the town in which plant had to be estab-


21
lished was on rock which required mining methods for almost every
post hole. In the other, the surface soil was an easily cut loam, but the
sub-soil which was found at 30 to 36 inches from the surface was what is
locally called "hard pan," being a very tough clay interspersed with
holders. The cost of pole lines in each of these cases was over twice the
estimated cost.
I advise also that you examine carefully as to whether a clear right
of way is provided by the owners or whether any part of same must be
obtained by the contractors. In a case in my experience the owners
guaranteed the use of streets for poles and specified a given length for
pole. They did not guarantee a clear right of way for wires strung on
the size of pole specified, although a casual reading of the specifications
would cause the contractors to believe that this latter guarantee was
intended. The result was a heavy investment by the contractors in
extra length of poles to surmount obstacles such as existing pole lines
and shade trees. In another case the owners undertook to furnish a
cleared right of way through certain forest lands, but wrote elsewhere
in the specifications that the contractor should locate the line so as to
minimize the risk of interruption. The interpretation placed by the
owner on this latter cause would have compelled the contractor to cut
down every tree in the forest for 100 feet on each side of the clear right
of way which he guaranteed because of the risk of a wind-storm causing
one of the said trees to fall and interrupt the line. The contractor did
not in this case suffer by the trick, but it was not through a judicial
interpretation of the contract that he secured immunity, but by taking
similar advantage of clauses which were capable of being read to his own
advantage.
Having secured preliminary information and come to designing I
advise shat you consider your installation as a whole, adapting each part
to each other. The profession has suffered in the past from electrical
engineers who install excellent dynamos and circuits in combination
with steam plants which were bought by the pound and not engineered
at all.
This fault is not yet unknown in the business, and some of the worst
sinners are manufacturing compan:es who take gross contracts for steam
and electrical apparatus; afterwards sub-letting the steam plant to the
lowest bidder who will undertake to conform to, or to evade, the specifi-
cations. The electrical engineer of to-day must be at least a first-class
steam engineer, and if he be also a good hydraulic engineer, it will help
him much.
My method of attack on the problems of a complete plant, is to
decide first the economical size of station unit, treating the dynamo and
the engine which drives it as one and not as two things. If each engine
must drive several dynamos I consider the set of engine and attached
dynamos as the unit. This size in a large plant is fixed by the minimum
load. In a small plant of one unit, by the maximum load I select such
a size as will never run under-loaded; a study of the load curve, either


THE TECHNIC.
actual or estimated, gives the size very readily. When only a single
unit is to be installed the only question to be considered is the greatest
number of lights ever to be connected. In a large station the additional
units should be preferably duplicates of the standard, but in plants
having a great variation of load during the 24 hours, the additional units
may be multiples of the standard, the object being to obtain such sizes
as will permit of the load being handled at any time with efficiency;
which practically means that each machine shall be run at, or near, its
full capacity. If conditions are favorable for storage batteries larger
units and a less number may be installed because it is plain that the
lowest point of the load curve will be the lowest actual load plus the
largest charge which the storage battery can simultaneously receive.
In that line of study I recommend you to investigate the recent papers
read before the Institute of Electrical Engineers.
A favorite arrangement is a set of three equal units of which any
two can handle the maximum load without being overstrained. I do not
require that the condition of maximum load should be the condition of
maximum efficiency, but rather that the efficiency should be good over
as wide a range of load as possible, but the maximum load can be handled
without mechanical injury, although at somewhat lower efficiency.
The reason for this is that in the majority of stations, the maximum
load lasts for a very short time, and that apparatus designed to be at
highest efficiency during the few minutes of full load will be necessarily
of lower efficiency during all the remaining hours of the day. In prac-
tice this consideration has led me to advocate the use of engines smaller
than are usually employed in connection with any given size of genera-
tor. For instance, the daylight load of the Detroit city plant is handled
by a 55 kilo-watt alternator which is connected to a compound engine
rated at 60 H—P. The practice of five years ago would have required an
engine of 100 H—P rating, to give a safe margin over the ultimate capac-
ity of the alternator. The practice of the present day would require an
80 H—P engine. I find that my engine works with fair economy between
40 and 75 H—P and that the efficiency of the set including exciter is 76
per cent, at half load of the alternator, and 82 per cent. when the alter-
nator is fully loaded and the engine is indicating all the horse power that
is safe to put upon its cranks. My specifications for this engine called
for one that would have its maximum economy at 60 H—P with a
medium pressure of steam and could be worked at 90 H—P without
straining its parts, by raising the steam pressure. We have worked it
up to 95 frequently. We get in this way a good all day eiliciency, and
the limit of power at comparatively low steam economy is only reached
during an average of one-half hour daily during the two mid-winter
months. At those times the release pressure of the steam in the low-
pressure cylinder is something like 30 lbs., which does not by any means
imply economy. Yet it is actually a saving of money to operate the
engine in this manner rather than to divide the load and start a second set.
The friction of the new set would reduce the efficiency more than the


23
overload on the running set, and the saving in oil alone will about pay
for the heat units lost by excessive release pressure during half an hour.
This is an instance from a lighting plant. Take the conditions of a
street railway having but 10 to 15 cars and you have similar peaks on
the load line not only once a day but probably once a minute. As street
railway engines were first proportioned to their generators, the rule was
2 H—P at point of maximum steam economy, per kilo-watt. Later prac-
tice brought this down to 1£ H—P per kilo-watt. The latest and best
practice as exemplified in some recent contracts requires only 1 H—P at
the point of maximum economy per kilo-watt capacity of generator.
But the framing of this last engine is even heavier than that of the
engine which would have been installed under the original rating of
2 H—P per kilo-watt; and its fuel economy in combination with a proper
boiler, is 33 to 40 per cent, better.
You will notice that a generator which taxes its driving engine to
its utmost before it has reached its own limit of load is not at all likely
to be burned out. The application of a load which would be dangerous
to the generator simply holds up the engine. You will remember that
with the generator the efficiency is practically constant from quarter
load to full load. With the engine rated in the usual way it is practically
constant from three-quarter load to 25 per cent. over-load. You will
remember also (in considering the likelihood of injury to either of the
two machines) that the risk to the engine is in terms of the stress only;
while the risk to the generator is in all modern machines in terms of the
stress times the period of application of the stress; in other words that
the rate of doing work is the measure of the risk of breakage of an
engine shaft or piston, while the temperature of danger to a dynamo is
only attained after abnormal work has continued for a measurable time.
Modern dynamos do not strip their armature coils or bend their shafts
under "short-circuits."
I mentioned that two of the three equal units should handle the
maximum load. This implies that the third is in reserve. I believe that
no electrical plant should be installed without a reasonable reserve in
boilers and in engines and dynamos. It is hard to educate new investors
to this idea, but old investors know that a stoppage of service in a light-
ing plant even for 30 seconds means the loss of more money than would
pay t^e interest of an adequate reserve of machinery. Even in the case
where your customers cannot leave you—in the case of my own plant
for instance, where the city owns its plant and is its own customer, an
interruption of the light is objectionable for economical reasons; because
the traffic of a large city needs for its safety adequate light and because
the accidents that may occur during a short extinction in busy hours
will cost more to the taxpayer than can possibly be saved by omitting
the reserve machinery from the installation. The printed rules by
which our plant is controlled begin by asserting that the results sought
are reliability of light, quality of light, and lastly and least of the three,
cheapness of light.


THE TECHNIC.
Following the idea of the paramount importance of reliability, you
will find it necessary to discard many of the little economies tnat are
dear to the hearts of theorists. Thus, one of the continual cries of news-
paper engineers is that the losses in condensation in steam pipes not
necessarily used during the day, are a great detriment to the coal pile.
That is true, yet I deliberately leave in connection with the boilers every
foot of steam mains that is not under repair, and I provide for the return
of the condensed water by encouraging further condensation in no less
than six steam loops, and I believe that I am right in doing so. Because
if I allow piping to be shut off it will contract as it cools and expand as
the steam strikes it again in a manner that is very detrimental to the
tightness of joints and to the safety of hangers, and I cannot afford to
have a steam pipe fail during the run. I avoid strains on my steam
mains more carefully than 1 avoid undue electrical strains on my insula-
tion. And those steam loops are in service 24 hours a day in spite of
some of my theoretical friends; because in a years experiencb they have
never failed to return the condensed water and keep it out of the steam
passages where it would be harmful, while asking for no attention and
little supervision. I cannot find a steam trap to work at 165 lbs. pressure,
which will not insist at altogether unreasonable times on having its
necessities attended to, under penalty of a wrecked engine through its
refusal to work.
Having selected the size of station unit two sequences follow. One
is the general plan of the building and the other the size of the boilers.
In the boilers there is more latitude than in the engines, because boilers
work "in parallel." The rule of three units, two in service and one in
reserve is good for a plant in constant service; and a still better rule,
where money is to be had without special difficulty, is to have a dupli-
cate equipment of boilers and to work each set alternately. There can-
not be too much attention paid to the slow heating up and slow cooling
down of boilers and their settings. If it be possible to take time, and
more time, and lots of time for these two operations, your bill for boiler
repair will be negligible in the total expense of operation, and will be
but a minute fraction of what it will surely be if you hurry your boilers
into and out of active service.
As between water tube and Are tube boilers, I have no preference.
Both types are now so varied that a satisfactory boiler for any duty can
be had in either class. I have previously noted that convenience of
cleaning may dictate the choice of a very simple boiler, the alternative
being the establishment of a water purifying plant. If you should find
yourself obliged to have a boiler readily cleaned, I advise you to study
the possibilities of the Lancashire boiler which is by no means so well
known in the United States as it deserves to be. Where high steam
pressures are necessary and the water and fuel are both good, the Marine
"dry back" boiler with internal furnaces, as it is built by the Contin-
ental Iron Works, and by Mr. C. C. Peck of Rochester, should be consid-
ered in conjunction with water tube boilers. The only objections to the


26
internally fired boilers are their tendency to smoke when fed with infer-
ior fuel, and the high skill in boiler making that is necessary in adapting
them to the pressures of steam now in use. You do not want to trust
the ordinary boiler-maker with the construction of a shell boiler for
180 lbs. pressure.
The larger sizes of boiler are preferable to the smaller as economizing
both fuel and labor. Marine practice is much in advance of stationary
practice in recognizing this.
In the plan of the building you will usually find yourselves limited
by the size and shape of the ground available. The general rule to be
followed is that the machinery should be located on the plau with a view
to economy of operation and of attendance, and that thereafter the lines
of the building should be drawn around the machinery. If architectural
effects are sought, they should be limited to the outside, and should not
affect the floor plan, or the cross-section of the building. We have a
class of architects now who recognize the fact that a building should
express its purpose, and that a power-house should look like a power-
house, and not like a baronial castle. If it is your good fortune to be
associated with one of these men, you should look on him as a fellow
engineer; but if your architect is one who looks on the machinery as an
accessory to the building, much sorrow will be avoided by an early defini-
tion of the necessities of your part of the work.
Of course the location of the building has to be considered in connec-
tion with the distribution system as well as with the facilities for supply-
ing fuel and water. There are frequently several sites available and the
choice is a balancing of advantages and disadvantages, both as to .first
cost and as to operating costs hereafter. In a small town or village the
selection of the site is complicated by another consideration; namely,
that the superintendent should be able to look after the plant and also
to be in touch with the customers and with any men he may have work-
ing in the town. I know of one plant where the convenience of securing
a side track for the bringing in of coal, caused the location of the plant
two miles from the district to be lighted. The line losses were compen-
sated for by the cheap handling of fuel, but in practice it was found
necessary to hire two men instead of one, and the additional salary
account of the down town office was twice what had been estimated as
the saving by the eccentric location. In a large plant there would be an
office and construction force entirely independent of the station opera-
ting force and they might almost as well be separate.
My practice is to begin the calculation of the distribution system,
which includes the calculation of the data necessary for the comparison
of proposed sites, by deciding on the voltage of transmission. This is
not a difficult matter in the more common cases, because it narrows
itself into the choice between a 3-wire 220 volt system and an alternating
transformer system of 1,000 or 2,000 volts primary E. M. F. There is a
certain distance, varying a little with the market for copper, and with
the cost of fuel at the location, within which distance, the 3-wire system


THE TECHNIC.
has no competitor. When to the 220 volt 3-wire system are joined the
intelligent use of the storage battery and of what are familiarly termed
"boosters,'' a system can be developed which will infallibly be a better
investment and a more efficient piece of engineering than any alternating
system of the same size.
But where local conditions prohibit the proper location of the power-
house, and where there is in sight business for two or three 3-wire sta-
tions, an alternating current system with its power-house located away
from the lighting center, may give just as good results technically and
financially.
A comparison between the two systems under the conditions which
I have just indicated can only be made in the largest cities. In the more
common cases as already said, it requires only a glance at the proposed
disrribution to decide whether direct current or alternating current is
preferable; and the plants of villages and small towns generally are and
will continue to be alternating plants. Where there is the opportunity
for a direct current plant it should be the duty of the engineer to impress
on the investor the full meaning of the limitation of the lighting area;
for when in the future you have to tell that investor that he cannot
reach a certain desirable piece of lighting in the outskirts without the
investment of what he calls a small fortune in copper, you will find that
your professional credit with him will depend on whether you have suffi-
ciently rubbed the idea into him that his plant is adapted to the thorough
lighting of a certain district and not to the picking up of the cream of
the lighting in all the neighboring townships. When your investor does
understand this thoroughly, you may leave your reputation safely in his
hands; for his plant under the conditions where you should advise direct
current is almost certain to be a money maker, and his opinion of your
ability will be influenced by the state of his pocket. You have doubtless
heard it said that the direct current plants in the United States are as a
whole profitable investments, while the alternating plants as a whole
are unprofitable. That statement should be understood to mean that
where the conditions of a district predicate a direct current low tension
installation, the lighting business of that district is almost sure to be
profitable.
In street lighting over the usual areas of American cities, some high
tension series system is an absolute necessity. Where arc lights are to
be used on the streets there is no other combination so good as the old
reliable series arc lamp with a 4,000 or 5,000 volt constant current
dynamo. For interior arc lighting I advise the use of arcs on the low
tension system. In direct current low tension work, arc lamps of many
makes can be had which are just as good as the best of the series lamps-
In alternating work, I cannot say so much; but I can say that alterna-
ting arcs are now giving good satisfaction on a frequency of 60 periods
per second, and that I believe the improvement in lamps and carbons
now being made will put the alternating current supply nearly on a par
with the direct current in this respect. Where a village requires a few


27
street arc lights it is worth while to use lamps of the same type as those
I recommend for interior work, in order to avoid the installation of a
small constant current dynamo. But I think that there are very few
villages where all the requirements of street lighting cannot be filled
economically and to public satisfaction by incandescent lights. Where
an alternating system is installed, the economical supply of incandescent
lights on the streets is an easy matter; a series of 20 or 30 lamps being
operated from the primary terminals of the dynamo.
Between 1,000 volts alternating and 2,000 volts alternating, there is
chance for considerable study before arriving at a decision. I cannot
recommend the 2,000 volt alternator for general service in the care of
the usual village engineer. The amount of trouble which a 2,000 volt
machine will develop as compared with the 1,000 volt machine is nearly
as the square of the voltage. 1,000 volts alternating is easily handled at
the switchboard, in transformers, and on the line; where 2,000 volts will
keep every person connected with it very much interested in the pro-
ceedings, unless the construction has been of the very best class. For
long transmission lines where step-up and step-down transformers are
used with no distributing devices on the high pressure line, I should not
hesitate to use any pressure up to 10,000 volts. My objections to the
higher pressures are only to their use in a general distribution under
care of attendants of ordinary skill.
I had this spring to estimate on a very widely scattered service in
the city of Detroit to be connected to the public lightning plant. That
plant has now an alternating system at 1,100 volts, serving 14 buildings
within the underground district by means of lead covered cables. I
found that a higher pressure would be economical for the extended ser-
vice and after careful inquiry decided on retaining the present pressure
in the station and in the " under-ground district," and serving the exten-
sions by a 2,200 volt transmission. In this case the existing plant is
2- phase and the step-up transformers allowed of transformation to
3- phases as well as to twice the primary voltage, so that I secured a very
favorable arrangement for long distance working.
I expect to see the polyphase alternator adopted by all large alter-
nating stations. Where the units are large they may just as well be
polyphase as be single phase; and the machines as built do not seem to
know whether they are in balance or out of balance, so that the bugbear
of "unbalancing" is disappearing from the minds of alternating engi-
neers just as it disappeared from the minds of those who introduced the
3-wire system when practice once showed how little it amounted to. It
does not much matter whether the machinery is 2-phase or 3-phase.
You can tranform either to the other. I expect also to see the general
adoption of a periodicity of between 50 and 60 per second in all the larger
American plants, and the regular running of alternators in parallel. A
large station with polyphase machines, of the periodicity mentioned,
working in multiple and distributing by circuits of comparatively little
loss and of good regulation to a minimum number of large transformers,


THE TECHNIC.
should be able to deliver light and power to consumers as cheaply as any
of the best 3-wire plants.
The voltage of transmission being selected, the location of the
power-house and the permissible loss of energy in the lines must be con-
sidered together. My practice is to make a calculation of the lines on
the-basis of any convenient percentage of loss; then to calculate the
expense of the energy expended in the line and the influence of an
increase or decrease in the amount of copper used. Lord Kelvin's law
applies directly to this case; with one limitation, which is the necessity
for good regulation in any system either of lighting or of power trans-
mission. If the load is constant or is to be connected at fixed times,
regulation is of minor importance, but if the load is of the usual char-
acter, namely, the demands of numerous customers, to be furnished at
any time without notice, and without pre-arrangement between the
customers, you will find that the regulation of a system under the vary-
ing load is paramount to any consideration of economy in tr ansmission.
It is useless to explain to your customers that you cannot afford under
Lord Kelvin's law to put as much copper in your lines as will keep their
lights at a constant potential. The only answer you will get is "Give
good light or stop the service." You must have the copper necessary
for uniform pressure on the lamps under all variations of distribution
and of load.
I advise that you avoid the too common blunder of looking upon the
increased voltage of transmission possible with an alternating supply,
merely as a means for economizing in copper. I advise that you consider
it rather as a means for improving your regulation. I knew a station
once upon a time where it cost $1,300 per annum to watch the qualizers
and boosters and keep the ends of the different feeders at the proper
pressure, while a good deal less than the capitalized value of $1,200 per
annum expended in the first instance would have made the system prac-
tically self-regulating.
NOTES ON WATER CONSUMPTION.
Q. S. WILLIAMS, '89, CIVIL ENGINEER TO DETROIT BOARD OF WATER
COMMISSIONERS.
A Direct Pressure System of Water Supply is understood to be a*
system in which the water flows directly from the pumps to the distri-
bution without passing through a storage reservoir, and consequently
one in which the speed of the pumps and the head pumped against must
be varied as the demand changes from hour to hour, unless it is consid-
ered more desirable to waste water at times of low consumption. It is
not possible to estimate the thousands of dollars that have been burned
in fuel to pump water that was wasted at the engines to keep them run-
ning. It seems to the writer that the designers of pumping machinery


29
-do not usually give the attention to this subject of variable demand
which its importance appears to require. It not infrequently happens
that the consumption will change from 3,000,000 gallons hourly at six in
the evening to 1,200,000 gallons between one and two in the morning,
while owing to decreasing friction with decreasing consumption the
head also falls and the work done by the engines drops as shown in the
following table:
TIME. WORK. WATER.
5 to 6 P. M. 3,300,000,000 ft. lbs. 3,000,000 gals.
6 to 7 p. M. 3,270,000,000 ft. lbs. 2,960,000 gals.
7 to 8 P. M. 3,130,000,000 ft. lbs. 2,825,000 gals.
8 to 9 P. M. 2,580,000.000 ft. lbs. 2,410,000 gals.
9 to 10 p. M. 1,935,000,000 ft. lbs. 1,965,000 gals.
1C to 11 P. M. 1,240,000,000 ft. lbs. 1,400,000 gals.
11 to 12 P. M. 1,155,000,000 ft. lbs. 1,350,000 gals.
12 to 1 a. m. 1,135,000,000 ft. lbs. 1,330,000 gals.
1 to 2 a. m. 1,085,000,000 ft. lbs. 1,210,000 gals.
From this it is seen that in two hours time the demand oil an engine
may decrease more than 50 per cent., and it can be similarly shown that
almost as rapid an increase may be expected.
The loss of economy by running modern engines below the rated
capacity is shown by the following record furnished by the Edward P.
Allis Co. of Milwaukee, Wis., from a 5 million gallon triple expansion
engine built by them for the Water Works of Brookline, Mass.:
At rated speed—Duty per 1,000 lbs. steam 135,000,000 ft. lbs. 100%
At £ rated speed—Duty per 1,000 lbs. steam... 132,000,000 ft. lbs. 98%
At H rated speed—Duty per 1,000 lbs. steam... 119,000,000 ft. lbs. 88%
At rated speed— Duty per 1,000 lbs. steam... 90,000,000 ft. lbs. 67%
In the last case the steam was allowed to follow full stroke.
This shows that with one of the best designs of the modern pumping
engines the efficiency is reduced 12% by reducing the delivery a little
more than one-half. If in following the decreasing consumption of a
hot summer afternoon an engine is laid off it soon becomes cooled, and
when a few hours later it is to be started a considerable amount of fuel
must be expended in warming it again. These questions become of
material consequence where large engines are handled. When once in
motion economy dictates that they should be kept in motion, but if in
so doing the efficiency must be lowered 12% we at once have to consider
which is the more economical, to stop or to reduce speed. It is not the
writer's purpose to advance any views as to how the question can best be
handled, but it seems that the demand is for an engine that will pump
from 10,000,000 to 36,000,000 gallons of water per twenty-four hours with
comparatively constant economy. The tendency of present practice is
to large engines and this will call more than ever for a wide range of
capacity. The enormous consumption of water in many American cities
is largely due to this defect in engine design, and it is patent to all


THE TECHNIC.
observers that those cities which use the largest quantities of water are
those supplied by direct pressure systems.
As is well known the consumption in the United States far exceeds
that elsewhere and yet the evidences of it are not apparent on the sur-
face. In the large American cities the consumption daily per consumer
ranges from above 400 gallons in Buffalo to 57 in Providence, the great
majority falling between 100 and 180 gallons, although because the
actual number of consumers is seldom known or accurately estimated
these figures may be too low.
The information obtainable from the reports of water-works gener-
ally is of such fragmentary character that it is difficult to determine
what allowances to make for the various uses of water in an American city.
In the city of Detroit where the consumption averages about 145
gallons, for some time back an attempt has been made to determine into
what channels this vast quantity of water flowed. The conditions in
this city furnish excellent opportunities for such an investigation, inas-
much as in 1888 meters were introduced and were applied first to manu-
facturing establishments, then to mercantile places of business, hotels,
saloons, etc., and lastly to private residences, so that in 1894 the metered
consumption practically represented the business consumption. The
entire quantity of water used on Belle Isle Park has been metered for
two years, and the schools, police stations and other public buildings
have also been metered with one or two exceptions.
In 1896 the consumption measured by meter was as follows:

The average daily per consumer consumption as measured by plunger
displacement at the engines for 1896 was 131 gallons.
If we take out the 24 gallons above it leaves 107 gallons per con-
sumer to be accounted for in domestic usage, waste and leakage, and in
street and lawn sprinkling. From an extended investigation into the
causes of consumption in this city, for which see Michigan Engineers'
Annual for 1895, the writer determined the average necessary domestic
consumption to be about 22 gallons per consumer daily, which included
lawn sprinkling.
Of the 85 gallons remaining to be accounted for perhaps 5 gallons
could be charged to errors in registers and slip at pumps, and possibly
the same amount to similar errors of the meters. A portion is used in
blowing off and cleaning out mains, but this cannot amount to more
than 1 gallon, and the remainder appears to be waste and leakage and
water used in street sprinkling.
The item Class II, "Depots," refers only to the use in the depot
buildings and adjoining offices and does not include water used on loco-
motives or in shops or yards.
The item Class VII, "Street Flushing," represents the water used in
cleaning the surface of asphalt paved streets by washing with a jet of
water, by which the accumulations of the day are carried into the
sewers. The amount given was used in flushing 320,000 sq. ft. of surface
58 times, 360,000 sq. ft. 29 times, and 460,000 sq. ft. 24 times, or it is the
equivalent of the amount required to flush 32,032,000 sq. ft. once, whence
it appears that about 320 gallons of water are required to wash 1,000
sq. ft., the washings taking place every night. The street so treated was
Woodward Avenue from the- Grand Circus Park to Jefferson Avenue,
and is the principal retail business street of the city.
A study of the consumption of individual school houses, hospitals,
and hotels shows that little relation seems to exist between the number


THE TECHNIC.
of pupils, inmates or guests and the water used, the latter depending
apparently upon the number and kind of fixtures for its supply.
In studying the consumption of water in an American city for a
year there will usually be found two periods of maximum and two of
minimum. The first period of maximum occurs during the winter and
is generally coincident with the most protracted period of cold weather,
and is due to the waste of water by households and others to prevent the
freezing of pipes. This will be followed by a minimum when conditions
no longer call for this waste and before hot weather comes. The second
maximum occurs in the summer and will be coincident with the most
protracted period of hot dry weather, and is in turn followed by a mini-
mum in the fall. The absolute maximum may occur either in the cold
or the warm period, and similarly the absolute minimum may be in the
spring or the fall. Generally the maximum hourly consumption in
cities of this latitude will occur in the summer. As to the relations
between temperature, precipitation and the use of water it appears that
for a range from about the freezing point to about 50 degrees above zero,
Fahrenheit, variations of temperature exert no influence upon consump-
tion, but any change above the latter point will affect it and it will
increase rapidly with higher temperature and decrease as temperature
falls more slowly than it increased. Below the freezing point the con-
sumption rapidly increases as the temperature falls and decreases less
rapidly as the cold becomes less intense. Below a temperature of, 50
degrees Fahrenheit, precipitation exerts but little if any effect upon the
uses of water, but with temperature above that point precipitation
causes a sudden and marked decrease amounting in one case to as much
as 12,000,000 from 53,000,000 gallons in a single day in Detroit in 1895.
Plates A and B show the variations in consumption in Detroit for 1895
and 1896 by days. The study of consumption by months adds nothing to
the principles applied to the consumption by years; temperature and
precipitation being the ruling factors. But in studying the weekly con-
sumption other factors appear. In those periods when temperature and
precipitation do not obscure other causes of variation the consumption
is found to change with the days of the week; the Sunday consumption
being always much below that of other days, while Monday, Wednesday
and Friday usually represent maxima, the days being divided so as to
include the 24 hours following 7 A. M.
Perhaps the most interesting features of water consumption are
apparent only when the consumption is studied from hour to hour. As
shown in Fig. 2 of Plate C, in periods of normal usage of water the least
consumption occurs between one and four o'clock in the morning. At
six o'clock there is a decided increase which usually continues till about
ten, after which the consumption drops off gradually lor the remainder
of the day, a slight increase occurring between one and two in the after-
noon, which does not appear in the Sunday consumption. During these
periods the hourly maximum is usually about twice the hourly mini-
mum. Fig. 1 of the same plate shows the effects of cold weather. The


33
maximum still appears between eight and ten in the morning, the
increase at one o'clock is still apparent, but another increase appears
frequently at seven o'clock and still another at about ten in the evening.
The last is probably due to the opening of fixtures for the night by the
consumers just before retiring, while the seven o'clock increase is partly
accounted for by the similar opening of fixtures by those who let their
fires go down after the evening meal. The minimum in periods of very
cold weather is seen to be but little below the maximum and on one day
occurred before ten in the evening, although generally the decrease of
consumption for business purposes is sufficient to keep the period of
minimum consumption in the early hours of the morning. Fig. 3, which
represents a week of hot weather consumption, shows some very decided-
ly different features. The minimum occurs at the same time as before
and is still about half of the maximum; there is a temporary maximum
in the forenoon corresponding to the absolute maximum of the former
cases, but the real maximum occurs late in the afternoon. These changes
in the lines of consumption are very largely due to the use of water for
lawn sprinkling. A peculiar feature of this chart is that while we
ordinarily have a small increase at seven in the evening during the
other week days, this does not appear Saturday, which may be in part
due to the closing of business at an early hour Saturday, and to the
habits of the people in spending Saturday evening away from home and
hence leaving the lawn hose unused. In all cases a drop in consumption
occurs about one A. m. probably due to the closing of hotels and saloons.
The effect of a rain in hot weather is well represented by the curve for
Monday when the rainfall shown occurred in the afternoon. The fire
shown by the black areas for Tuesday and Wednesday of this week was
one calling out seven of the largest engines in the service of the city.
Fig. 3 exhibits the very limited effect of precipitation when the temp-
erature has fallen below 50 degrees Fahrenheit as already pointed out.
Tiie following data covering the last three years may be found of interest
in connection with this subject:

It may be proper to say, in connection with these figures, that 1895
shows abnormal results both from cold and heat, while 1896 is below the
average with respect to the effect of each.


THE TECHNIC.
Thus far we have only considered the statistics of consumption with
reference to the quantity of water that must be provided at various
times. When we come to the question of machinery these considera-
tions become of increased moment. Every water supply system is in
the broadest sense of the term a machine, and as every machine has a
rate of operation at which the maximum efficiency is developed it
becomes an important duty of the engineer of such a system to so
thoroughly study not only the details of his works, but the plant as a
whole, that he may determine as nearly as possible the adjustment of
the various conditions relatively to each other to produce maximum
economy. Were the quantity of water used constant, or were conditions
so arranged that at times of minimum consumption maximum pressure
would be wanted, the arrangement of distribution and engines would be
comparatively simple, but with the former varying not only with time,
but differently in different localities, with the maximum pressure re-
quired at the periods when maximum delivery is wanted, and with the
lift of the pumps usually at or near its highest when the other require-
ments combine to make the demands upon the engines the most severe,
a series of complications are introduced in the problem which, though
doubtless often unappreciated even by engineers, are nevertheless of far
reaching importance in the operation of the system.
The losses to be overcome in a water-works system may be classed
under two heads: losses due to overcoming the elevation of the terri-
tory supplied, and losses due to frictional resistances in the pipe lines.
The former will change only with the quantity of water elevated, but
the latter increase when the velocity of flow is increased. While it is
generally assumed that these latter increase with the square of the
velocity, some authorities consider the investigations upon which the
theorem is based too limited to fully warrant the deduction. As the
losses due to the former cause cannot be reduced except by reducing the
quantity of water elevated, the greater attention is devoted to the latter,
which are susceptible of modification, though it will never be possible to
wholly eliminate them. To furnish the necessary data for investigating
this subject there is kept at the pumping station an hourly record of the
quantity pumped as measured by plunger displacement, and the head
pumped against. At twenty-five locations about the city readings are
taken hourly from pressure gages attached to the mains. Each gage
reading is assumed to represent the pressure upon a district which is
determined by the contour of the surface and the arrangement of the
distribution. To obtain the average pressure on the system at any time
or for any period, the gage readings are each multiplied by the areas of
their districts and the sum of these products divided by the area of the
city. In the investigations thus far it has been assumed that the con-
sumption of water is uniform throughout the whole city. That this
assumption though erroneous in itself is not productive of false results
when the distribution is considered as a whole, will appear from the fact
that the pumping station is located at one extremity of the system, and


35
the poiat of maximum consumption, from which the usage decreases
approximately with the distance in all directions, is located on the line
bisecting the system at right angles to the normal direction of flow from
the pumps. From the records kept at the engines their work is com-
puted in foot pounds. On the above assumption the average pressure
obtained as already described multiplied by the quantity pumped gives
what has been termed the Usable Work, or the work is delivered to the con-
sumers, neglecting leakage. When an average elevation of the system
is obtained by using the elevation of each pressure gage similarly to its
readings and multiplying by the quantity of water pumped, the Work of
Elevation is obtained. Subtracting the sum of the Usable Work and the
Work of Elevation from the Work of the Engines leaves the work
expended in overcoming Frictional Resistances. Plates D and E show
the work expended in the system during 1894 and 1895, and also the tem-
perature and precipation by weeks. The line of the work of elevation
may also be taken to represent the variations in the consumption, and
the large increase in the work of the engines produced by a small
increase in the consumption is apparent. This is perhaps more clearly
shown in Plates F and tf, which show the water pumped by hours for a
maximum day in winter and a maximum day in summer together with
the Work of Engines, Usable Work, Work of Elevation, and Frictional
Work, as well as the similar divisions of the pressure pumped against.
Fig. 1, Plate H, shows the similar data for a day of minimum consump-
tion. The last three plates are drawn to the same scale. The peculiari-
ties of the fluctuations of consumption are more clearly brought out in,
the work of the engines. From such a series of charts it is possible to-
compile a table or plot a curve showing just what may be expected of
the distribution under any reasonable conditions, and hence enabling one
to determine almost absolutely the limit of its economical capacity.
By taking the record of each gage separately and determining the
frictional loss in pressure to that location the weak portions of the dis-
tribution may be readily detected, and with the varying consumptions
in different localities at different seasons an equation might be derived
from which could be determined with reasonable accuracy the quantity
of water consumed in the various districts.
Returning to the consideration of summer consumption, Fig. 2 of
Plate H, shows the quantity of water used and the work expended in
providing for hot weather uses, the latter being represented by the
shaded area, which was obtained in the following manner: The temper-
ature for June 3, as shown by the full line in the lower part of the figure,
was exceptionally high and followed a week of very hot dry weather,
(see Plate A), this being in fact the hottest week of the year. The work
of the engines by hours for June 3 is represented by the area below the
full heavy line of the diagram. June 4 opened with higher temperature
and increased consumption as is shown by the dotted lines of tempera-
ture and work before 8 A. m., but at 9:45 rain began falling. The effect
of this was presaged by the sudden decrease of the demands upon the


THE TECHNIC.
engines after 8 o'clock. The rain continued until 8 P. m. of that day and
though the total precipitation was less than one-fifth of an inch it was
accompanied by a fall of temperature from a maximum of 96° on the
third to a minimum of 50° on the morning of the sixth. The work of
the engines for June 5 is represented by the area below the broken line
bounding the shaded area. It seems clear that the only uses of water
likely to be affected by a rain and such a fall of temperature are those
for lawn sprinkling and cooling purposes, and hence any decrease of
consumption at such a time must be due to the cessation of these uses.
It will be at once appreciated that not all the water so used was shut off,
but whatever difference there is between the consumptions of June 3 and
June 5 that is not accounted for by incidental causes, as fires and the
day of the week, fluctuations may be fairly ascribed to the causes under
consideration. Making corrections for the work caused by the Are
between 5:30 and 8 p. m. of June 3, shown by the area marked "Fire,"
when four steamers were in service, and for the usual nightly variations
between Sunday and week nights, the diagram shows 13,475,131,167 foot
pounds, or more than one-third of the average daily work of the year,
and nearly two-thirds of the work of the day of minimum consumption
shown to the same scale in Fig. 1 of the same plate, as due to sprink-
ling and cooling uses. This is perhaps an exceptional case even in Detroit,
and Detroit is probably an exceptional city in this regard, but it is inter-
esting as showing to what extent the consumption may go at such times
if unrestricted. The consumption on June 5 remained about 4,000,000
gallons above the average for 1896.
PLANE TABLE*
J. B. DAVIS, '68.
32. Running a Straight Line.—If the line is already platted, set up
the plane table at a station on the line, and orient it. The alidade being
at the center of the sheet, mark its position on the paper by drawing
fine lines at the ends of the work edge of the rule, and at the ends of the
rule, so that the slightest movement of the rule on the sheet can be
readily detected. Be particular to see that the levels read level. The
line may then be run, as with a transit, reversing the plane table on
its spindle as a transit is reversed, leaving the alidade undisturbed on the
sheet. Extreme care is required to keep from moving the alidade on
the sheet.
In case the line is not platted and it is to be prolonged, set the
line of sight on a mark, at a station of the line, in the direction from
the plane table, opposite to that in which the line is to go; using the

hands to move the alidade over the sheet; not disturbing the board,
as it is oriented; and keeping the edge of the rule at the center of
the sheet. Reverse the telescope on its axis and locate a line staff in
apparent line at the place where the next station is needed. Reverse the
telescope on its axis and see if the line of sight strikes the back sight
mark. If it does not, repeat the pointings, correcting the levelling, or
setting of the plane table till it will. Do not disturb the orientation of
the table if the setting, or levelling, requires correction, or if it is dis-
turbed, orient the table again. Having located the staff in apparent
line, drive a stout stake, called a plug, in its place. While the plug is
being driven try the back sight again, see that the table is level, and be
ready to give line for a point on the plug. Set the staff in line, on the
plug, with the same tests by back sighting, as before. Mark the point,
thus found on the plug, by a temporary mark, such as may be made by
sticking the point of the line staff into the top of the plug a little.
Release the spindle clamp. Reverse the plane table on its spindle.
Level it again if needed. Set the line of sight on the back sight mark
by means of the spindle clamp and slow motion screw, the alidade not
being moved on the sheet. The table will no longer be oriented, being
reversed, and may not be precisely in a reversed position, that is, not just
180° from its first position, unless all parts of the alidade are in adjust-
ment. Reverse the telescope on its axis and locate a second temporary
mark on top of the plug, with the same tests, by back sighting as before.
Drive a nail equidistant from the two temporary marks to mark the sta-
tion on the line.
Set up a picket a little behind the plane table, and on line for a
mark to back sight to from the forward station. A picket is a stick
3 or 4 feet long, about an inch or so thick, having a foot or so of its top
straight and blazed off white, with its bottom end sharpened for driving
into the ground. The picket is set so as to stand firm, with its white top
end plumb and in line. If close to the table it may be lined by looking
back over the telescope tube, or, if the telescope is inverting, by looking
through it from the object end. If a little distance away the picket may
be lined by sighting through the telescope in the ordinary manner.
Move the plane table to the forward station. Set it up and orient it.
Use the station where it stood for a back sight, and continue the line as
before.
Some telescopes do not reverse on their axes. They may be made in
such cases to be lifted readily from the wyes or standards. With such a
telescope the above directions need modification. Open the wye clips so
the telescope can be lifted out before beginning to make the pointings.
To reverse the telescope lift it from the wyes; turn it over, end for end;
and replace it with each end of its axis in the same wye it was in before.
Otherwise than this, the pointings are made the same as with a telescope
that reverses on its axis. The chances of disturbing the alidade on the
sheet are greater with this form of mounting, and corresponding care
and pains are required.


THE TECHNIC.
If the telescope does not reverse and does not lift out of the wyes,
'run the line by foresights.
To run a line by fores:ghts, set up the plane table at a station of the
line and orient it. Mark a station in the direction in which the line is to
go to sight to, to get the line called a foresight. Set the line of sight on
the foresight mark by moving the alidade over the sheet with the hands;
not disturbing the board, as it is oriented; and keeping the edge of the
rule at the center of the sheet. Mark the position of the rule on the
sheet. Locate a point on a plug beyond the foresight, and where it can
be seen from the foresight station. See if the line of sight still strikes
the foresight. If not, repeat these operations till it will. Release the
spindle clamp. Reverse the plane table on its spindle. Reverse the
alidade on the sheet by the marks showing where the rule first rested.
Level the plane table again if needed. Set the line of sight on the fore-
sight by means of the spindle clamp and slow motion screw. The plane
table is no longer oriented. Locate a second point on the plug beside the
first, with the same tests. Drive a nail equidistant from the two marks
on the plug to mark the station on the line.
Move the plane table to the foresight station. Set it up and orient
it. Use the new station for a foresight, and continue the line as before.
When the line is not platted, or it is not necessary to orient the plane
table to do other work, the line may be prolonged by placing the alidade
to the center of the sheet without orienting the table, and the first
pointing made with the spindle clamp and slow motion screw.
The plat of the line as prolonged is found on the sheet by carefully
continuing the piece that is there, platting the new stations located, and
testing their position on the sheet by shots at well determined points
previously platted.
33. Intersecting Two Straight Lines.—Extend the lines on the
ground and set two plugs with nails to mark one of the lines, the
plugs standing one on each side of the other line as nearly as can be
judged. Stretch a string between the nails. Set a third plug under
the string and on the other line. Drive a nail in this plug where the
other line crosses the string. This nail will mark the intersection of the
lines.
The two first plugs may, by miss-judgment, be on the same side of
the second line. In that case extend the string to cross the second line
and tie it to a stake. Or the first line may be marked by another plug
which shall stand on the other side of the second line.
Sometimes the three plug method is inconvenient because the
ground is so rough. Then set two plugs on each line so as to straddle
the other; draw two strings; and set a nail in a fifth plug to mark the
intersection.
Sometimes the last plug comes considerably below the string, or
strings,—too far below for good sighting. In such a case hold a plumb
line so as to look past it and the string being used to line by. Make the
plumb line cover the string and the sight will be in a vertical plane with


39
the string. A weight tied on a string will do. Steady the hand holding
the plumb line on a staff if needed.
Sometimes strings cannot be stretched between the line plugs. Set
up the plane table over the nail in one of the plugs; set the line of sight
on the nail in the other and do the sighting with the line of sight of the
alidade. This takes more time. This plan may be used in case the inter-
section plug comes in a hole.
It may be sufficient for the purposes of the work to plat the lines on
the paper and produce them there till they meet.
34. Measuring the Angle Between Two Lines.—Intersect the lines.
Measure the smaller angle between them.
Set up the plane table at the intersection of the lines. Measure off
on the sides of the smaller angle between the lines from their intersec-
tion two hundred feet or more on each. Make the measurement care-
fully, and set a nail in a plug on each line to mark the ends of the meas-
urements, using the alidade to line the marks with. Measure the
distance between the two nails as precisely as practicable. Divide this
distance in feet by twice the number of feet measurement off on the two
lines from their intersection. The quotient will be the sine of one-half
the angle between the lines. Look up the correponding angle in the
table of natural sines and multiply it by two to get the angle between
the lines.
The same thing may be done with a scale on the drawing, using the
plat of the lines thereon. If five units of some convenient scale are used
in laying off the distances on the two sides of the angle, one-tenth of the
distance between the ends of the distances measured in the same unit
will be the sine of half the angle sought.
One of the lines may need to be prolonged past their intersection to
get the smaller angle. On the ground this will be done with the plane
table as in running a straight line. On the drawing, do it with the rule.
The measurements made on the ground may be used at once with
the scale and dividers to lay the angle down on the drawing without
finding the value of the angle.
The process applies to the angle between two lines of a survey, or to
the deflection angle from one to the next, since these angles are supple-
ments of each other.
35. Laying Out a Given Angle.—Plat the angle on the sheet of paper
with its vertex at the center of the sheet. Draw the lines which form
the sides of the angle out sufficiently to fit the rule of the alidade to, or
mark pieces of them so the outer end of the rule can be fitted to them,
if it is not desirable to draw the whole line. Or a separate extra piece of
paper may be fastened on the board for this work. If the extra paper is
used fasten it on first, find and mark the center of the sheet on it, and
plat the lines from that. Set up the plane table at the plug or station,
that is to be the vertex of the angle. Orient the table by one of the
platted lines. Set the alidade to the other line. Range out this line by the
line of sight of the alidade and mark it with plugs and nails on the ground.


THE TECHNIC.
If the given angle is much over 90° it will be better to plat its sup-
plement on the plane table sheet, and produce one side of the plotted
angle to get a plat of the given angle. This refers to the ordinary case
in the field where there is no protractor. If a protractor is used the
angle can be laid down on the sheet at once with that. Without a pro-
tractor use the table of natural tangents or natural sines.
To plat an angle with natural tangents measure off from the vertex
of the angle on the given or assumed side ten parts as large as can be
conveniently used, as 10 or 20 inches. Here draw a perpendicular to the
given side in the direction the angle is to lie. Take from the table the
natural tangent of the angle. Move its decimal point one place to the
right. Measure off on the perpendicular from the given side the result-
ing number of the same parts, ten of which were used in locating the
perpendicular. Draw a line from the end of this measurement on the
perpendicular to the vertex of the angle for the other side of the angle.
To plat an angle with natural sines take out the natural sine of half
the angle and multiply this line by two. With a radius of ten parts draw
the arc of a circle with the vertex as a center and cutting the given side.
With a radius of a number of the same parts equal to twice the line of
half the given angle with its decimal point moved one place to the right,
and the intersection of the arc and the given side as a center, draw an arc
cutting the first arc. Draw the other side of the required angle from its
vertex to the intersection of the two arcs.
36. Running a Traverse.—Run and plat the successive lines of the
survey in the manner previously described for the various items of ele-
mentary work, or determine the vertices of the angles of the lines of the
survey by any of the methods given. The result will be a plat of a con-
tinuous survey which is often called a traverse. Strictly speaking the
plane table does not run a traverse in the sense of that term in transit
work, but produces a plat of the lines traversed or surveyed. If compu-
tations are to be based on a plane table plat the lengths of the Sides
should be measured on the ground with a steel tape and the plat checked
by these measurements. The plat should also be to a large scale.
37. Obstacles on Straight Lines.—Obstacles are not frequently met
with on ordinary plane table surveys. The lines of the survey are chosen
so as to avoid them. It is, however, quite possible that they maybe met
with. If the scale of the plat on the board is so small that the object to
be passed would appear insignificant, or the lines used to pass it too short
for setting the alidade to, use an extra piece of paper, and plat the work
to a sufficiently large scale while passing the object. This will permit
the work to be checked, as well as to be done with sufficient precision.
38. Passing an Object on a Straight Line by Deflections. Fig. 5. —
Fasten an extra piece of paper over the middle of the sheet. Find and
mark the center of the sheet on the extra piece of paper. Set up the
table and orient it at some point of A B, as at B, where a line B C can be
laid out clear of obstructions. Start B C so as to pass the object. Draw
lines from m, the center of the sheet, towards C and towards A, of suit-


4t
able length to set the alidade by. Set the alidade on B C. Release the
spindle clamp. Turn the table round on its spindle and set the line of
sight on B A by means of the spindle clamp and slow motion screw, leav-
ing the alidade undisturbed on the sheet. Set the alidade again upon
B C and draw a second line from m
towards C. This is done for the purpose
of drawing a line from m that shall
make an angle with the line originally
drawn from m towards A equal to twice
D B C, or to lay down 2 D B C on the
sheet. Run B C to C, measuring its
length, or till a second line C D, run
so that CDB = DBC, will pass the ob-
ject. Move the table to C. Set it up.
Orient it on C B by the second line
drawn from m towards C when at B.
The line drawn from m towards A, when
at B, will now show the direction in
which to run C D. Run out C D accord-
ingly and make it equal by measure-
ment to C B, thus locating D. Release
the spindle clamp. Re-orient the table
by the first line drawn from m towards
C when at B, so as to orient the table
with respect to A B. Set the alidade
on C D and draw a line from m towards
D. Move the table to D. Set it up.
Orient it by the last line drawn.
Check.—Locate E, supposed to be in
A B, produced. Place the alidade on the line
towards C when at B. Release the spindle clamp,
its spindle axis and set the line of sight on E by means of the spindle
clamp and slow motion screw, leaving the alidade undisturbed on the
sheet. See if the line drawn from hi towards A when at B now points
to C. If it does not, review the work and correct the errors.
If it is considered to be sufficiently accurate, the point C may be
determined by resection from A B, and B C found from the plat. Good
practice would make use of C in determining other points and objects
required by the survey. In such a case B C and C D would be platted on
the sheet with other stations. The distance B D may be found by plat-
ting B C and C D to a large scale from the center of the sheet on the
extra sheet of paper and measuring the distance B D between their ends
to the same scale. Or measure the angle B C D on the ground with the
steel tape or on the plat with the scale (34) and find B D = 3 B C sin i
BCD.
first drawn from m
Turn the table rou nd


For a check upon such work run past the object more than once,
locating C in a different place, or prolong B C, and set another point on
line beyond D. Run past on opposite sides where practicable. Set up
the table at any one of the points beyond the object. Orient it by the
line to the station where the table stands. Locate E as before. See if
the other points beyond the object are in the line to E. Apply the check
above given at any of the points beyond the object and see if it fits.
39. Passing an Object on a Straight Line by Traversing. Fig. 6.—
Bun a traverse past the object, platting the lines of the traverse. The
stations on the traverse may be determined by measurement, resection,
or any of the usual methods. Extend the plat of the
11 r ^ original line on the sheet to the forward part of the plat
of the traverse. Draw a line on the plat from the last
station of the traverse so as to intersect the straight line
produced past the object, and in a position to be conven-
iently run out on the ground to reach the original line at
E a point beyond the object. Measure the length of this
line on the sheet with the scale. Having set up the plane
table at the last station of the traverse on the ground
and oriented it, run out the above described line, measure
out its length and locate a station beyond the object on
the original line produced. Continue the line by means
of the plat of it on the sheet.
The above method is comparatively rough, but may
be used in some cases. It is without a check. To im-
prove the results, the traverse may be platted on an extra
sheet to a large scale, and the closing distance more care-
fully measured. More than one traverse may be carried
past the object and the results compared. All the
stations on all the traverses may be useful in extend-
ing or perfecting the survey. The points beyond the
I a object may be checked by resection on other platted
stations.
The traverse may be carried a sufficient distance beyond the object,
as to D, E, and F, to permit of lines being drawn from E, and F, to H,
the point where the closing line D H intersects A B, produced past the
object. Locate H by intersections from D and E, and check it by resec-
tion on F. A second point K mav be located by similar means. A num-
ber of these stations may be used to check the locations of one another,
as well as form the basis for extending the survey.
40. Passing an Object on a Straight Line With the Plane Table
Alone. Fig. 7.—Set up the plane table at B. Orient it by B A. Run
out two lines B C and B D making such equal angles with A B that they
will pass the object. Set a station D on B D, so that D C perpendicular
to A B will pass the object. Set plugs as near C as can be estimated


43
preparatory to intersecting D C with B C. Move the table to D. Set
it up. Orient it by D B. Assume a point d for the plat of D, on the
plat of D B, so as to give a good length to the lines of the diagram
being developed on the sheet to set the rule of the alidade by. From d
lay out a line on the sheet to represent the plat of D C, perpendicular to
a b. Run this line out on the ground and
intersect it with B C at C. Continue the
line on the plat and find c. Start the lines
D E and D F for locating E and F at con-
venient angles from D B, and draw d e and
df on the plat to intersect a b produced.
Set plugs on D E and D F, as near E and F
as can be estimated preparatory to inter-
secting these lines with C E and C F. Lay
out c e and of from c on the plat, making
BCE = BDEandBCF = BDF. Move
the plane table to C. Set it up at C.
Orient it by C B. Test its position by C D.
Run out C E and C F. Intersect them
with D E and D F, locating E and F.
Move the plane table and set it up at E or
F, as may be most desirable. Orient it by
the line to C. Test its position by F E and
the line to D. Continue the line to H, or
any point beyond, using F E or A B, as
they should be the same.
This work may require an extra sheet of
paper, but the practitioner will readily
decide such matters for himself. C, D, E, and F, may be used as regular
stations on the survey. The object may be platted as this work proceeds.
41. Passing an Object on a Straight Line by Resection. Fig. 8.—
Locate E in A B produced beyond the object. Choose
D as any convenient station on the same side of the
object that E is. Set up the table at E and orient it
by A B. Set the alidade on E D, and draw a line
towards D, anywhere on the sheet. Move the table to
D. Set it up. Orient it by the last named line. Resect
on B and C to get D. Set the alidade on D E. Draw a
line from d, parallel to D E to intersect a b produced
to get e. Measure c e on the plat. As a check measure
D E on the ground and d e on the plat. See if they
agree.
The larger the scale used the more perfectly will the result be ac-
complished.
42. Inaccessible Lines.—Problems relating to inaccessible horizontal
.distances maybe solved with the plane table without calculation. This


THE TECHNIC.
is indicated by Figs. 6, 7, and 8. The relative elevation of the points
between which the required distance is found in these cases has theor-
etically nothing to do with the application of these principles. The same
is true of Fig. 3. A detailed account of problems relating to inaccessible
lines is not given, because the methods illustrated by these figures may
be adapted to all the ordinary cases to be met with. Problems of this
class are rare in plane table work.
43. Running Circular Curves. Fig. 9.—Intersect the tangents A I
and B I at I (33). Set up the plane table at I. Measure the angle DIB
— A (34). Choose a suitable curve. The curve
may be designated by its degree like a railroad
curve when the station chords, as Pj P„ Pa P„
etc., are 100 feet. When the station chords are
not 100 feet the curve may be named by using
the station chord for the numerator of a fraction
and the angle the station chord covers at the
center of the curve, as the denominator, thus
20'
I05
which signifies that a chord of 20 feet covers an
angle at the center of the curve of 10°. This
device may be called the "Name" of the curve.
It corresponds to the conception used in the
term "Degree" used in railroad curves, which
means the angle at the center covered by a sta-
tion chord of 100 feet, or the numerator of the
above fraction becomes 100. If the curve is de-
signated by its degree take its radius R, with
log R, from a curve table. If the curve is "named," as above, compute
R = . ^ ''—; , where a — the
sin i a
station chord and d the station angle it covers. Compute the tangents
I A = I B := T = R tan 1 A, and the vertex distance I K = V = T tan} .i.
Set the alidade on I M. Measure from I towards M, I B = T, and locate
B. Set a plug or stake and nail at B. Bisect the angle a i b on the
sheet, defining the direction of i k. Tne plane table should be oriented
with respect to I A and I B, using i a or i b to orient the table by and
check its position by the other. Set the alidade by i k. Range out the
line I K on the ground. Measure from I to K, I K = V, and locate K.
Set a stake and nail at K. Set the alidade on I L. Measure from I
towards L, I A = T, and locate A. Set a plug, or stake, and nail at A.
Move the plane table to A. Put on an extra sheet of paper if not already
done at I. Set up the table at A. Measure from the last preceding
station, as L, to A, as L A. Mark a witness stake for A, bearing the line
mark, as Q; the number of the regular station at L, plus the distance


45
from L to A, as 147 + 62.37; the letters P. C , point of curve; the degree
or name of the curve, as 4° or
20'

the direction of the curve, as L. for left, or R. for right; and the angle

chord covers at the center of the curve, by

Subtract \ dl from \ A. Divide the result by \ d. The remainder found

Subtract \ dy from \ A. Divide the result by i d. The remainder found

Plat the angle I A P, = i dt with its vertex at the center of the
sheet and with long sides for setting the alidade by in running- the curve.
On the same side of this angle, supposing the observer to be at its vertex,
that the curve is to run, plat i d, one-half the regular station angle.
Number these lines 0, 1, 2, in the order they come in, laying down the
angles platted. Still on the same side of the last angle platted, or con-
tinuing from line 2, plat i d2, and number this line 3. From line 2 also
plat i ds, in the same direction and number this final line 4.
Set the alidade on 0. Set the line of sight on A I by means of the
spindle clamp and slow motion screw. Set the alidade on 1. Take a
distance on the chain, or tape, equal to c, = A P,. Hold one end of this
distance at A. Swing the other end of this distance on the tape into line

at P,. Drive a stake at P„ marked for the number of that station, with
the number facing A. Test this stake for line and distance, and when it
is adjusted for both, drive a nail in it to mark the station Set the
alidade on 2. Hold one end of a distance on the tape, equal to the
regular station chord, at Pr Swing the other end into line at P^ Set a
stake at P2 marked for that station, with the same tests that were used
in setting- Pr Set the alidade back on line 0. See if the line of sight
still ranges the tangent A I. If not, review the work and correct the
errors. Set the alidade on 1. By means of the spindle clamp and slow
motion screw, set the line of sight on P2. Set the alidade on 2. Measure
a regular station chord from P? and locate P3 as P2 was located. Set the
alidade again on 1 and see if the line of sight strikes Pa. If not, review
the work from P2, and correct the errors. The alidade being set on 1, set
the line of sight on P3 and continue the curve as before, making the
various checks and tests to insure trustworthy work. So continue the
work till the station next preceding K, the middle of the curve, is
reached. This is P3 in Fig. 9. After P8 is set, and before shifting the
table on its spindle preparatory to locating the next regular station, set
the alidade on line 3. See if the line of sight strikes K. Measure the
distance from P3 to K. See if this equals C2. If either of these checks
fail, review the work and correct the errors. Continue the curve from
P3, not from K, till the station, as P6, next preceding the P. T. at B is
reached. After P6 is set and checked, set the alidade on line 4. See if
the line of sight strikes the P. T. at B. Measure from P5 to B. See if
this distance is c3. If either of these checks fail, review the work and
correct the errors. Mark a witness stake for the P. T. with the line
mark; the station number of P6 plus the distance P6to B; P. T.; the name
of the curve; L or R; and the value of A. Drive this stake about a foot
to the right of B, with the number facing P6. Subtract c3 from the
regular station distance to get the distance from B to M, the next regular
station beyond B.
With the plane table oriented so the line 4 is directed to B, set the
alidade on A I, and draw a line from to by the edge of the rule. Move
the table to B. Set it up over B. Set the alidade on m i, the last line
drawn. By means of the spindle clamp and slow motion screw, set the
line of sight on A. Set the alidade on line 4. See if the line of sight
ranges on the tangent B I. If not, review the work and correct the
errors.
Range out the tangent I B. Measure c — c3 from B to M, and locate
the first regular station on the tangent beyond B, at M. Continue the
taDgent as a straight line (33).
In case the whole curve cannot be seen from A, run as far as prac-
ticable, as to P2 in Fig. 9. After checking the location of the last station,
set the alidade on line 1, and make the line of sight strike the last station
by means of the spindle clamp and slow motion screw, just as if prepar-
ing to locate the next regular station. Set the alidade on A I. Draw
to i from to towards I by the edge of the rule. Move the plane table to-


47
Pa. Set it up over P2. Turn the table so the same side of the sheet is
forward the way the curve is going, that was forward when at A. Set
the alidade on i m, the last line drawn, to look back to A. By means of
the spindle clamp and slow motion screw set the line of sight on A. Set
the alidade on line 2. Locate the next regular station in the usual man-
Der, measuring a station chord from P2. Check its location by a back
sight on A. Continue the curve as before directed for the table standing
at A; also check on K as before directed.
Should it be necessary to move up again, let P4 Fig. 9 be the station
to be used as the next instrument station. Set the alidade on i m again.
By means of the spindle clamp and slow motion screw, set the line of
sight again on A. Set the alidade on line 1. Make or find a mark in
apparent line on the tangent E F. Call this mark F. Release the
spindle clamp and set the line of sight on P4 by means of the spindle
clamp and slow motion screw, the alidade being still set on line 1. Set
the alidade on P2 F. Draw a line mf'by the edge of the rule. Move the
plane table and set it up over P4. Turn the same part of the sheet to be
forward as before. Set the alidade on/to to look back to P2. Set the
line of sight on P2 by means of the spindle clamp and slow motion screw.
Continue the curve as before.
Having moved up any number of times on a curve, let P4 be the
instrument station from which B can be seen and the curve closed.
Before beginning work from P4 after the table is oriented, set the alidade
on line 1 and make or find a mark in apparent line on the tangent G- H.
Call this point H. Having closed the curve on B by line 4, leave the
table with 4 pointing to B, and set the alidade on P4 H. Draw m h by
the edge of the rule. Move the table to B. Set it up over B and orient
it by h m, and a back sight on P4. Set the alidade on line 4. See if the
line of sight ranges the closing tangent B I. If not review the work and
correct the errors.
To lay out a tangent at any station as P4 and set up the plane table
there, orient it preparatory to continuing the curve. Set the alidade on
line 1, or whatever line was pointing to the instrument station from the
previous-instrument station when a pointing was made on the tangent
there, preparatory to moving up. The line of sight then ranges on the
tangent.
Obstructions to running the curve that cannot be removed may
often be passed by a long chord. Compute the distance from the station
where the plane table stands to the station beyond the obstruction which
can be seen, by
C, = 2 R sin i D„
where C, is the required distance, or long chord, and D, is the central
angle covered by C„ found by the number of station chords on the curve
between the two ends of C,. Run the curve as far as practicable towards
the obstruction. Having checked the location of the last station, and
without shifting the plane table, plat from line 2 an angle equal to one-

station at the far end of Cr Call the line thus laid down 5. Set the
alidade on 2. See that the table is level and the line of sight strikes the
last station located. If need be, level the table and set the line of sight
on the last station located by the spindle clamp and slow motion screw.
Set the alidade on 5. Run this line a distance C, from the station where
the table stands and locate a station beyond the obstruction. Mark the
tangent at the instrument station, as directed in the last paragraph.
Orient the table so that 5 will point to the station located beyond the
obstruction. Set the alidade on the tangent and draw a line by the edge
of the rule from the center of the sheet. Move the table to the station
located beyond the obstruction. Set it up there. Turn the table so the
same side is forward as before. Set the alidade on the last line drawn,
to look back at the station the table was moved from. Set the line of
sight on that station by means of the spindle clamp and slow motion
screw. Set the alidade on 5. Mark, or find a point in apparent line for
a mark on the tangent at the new station. Set the alidade on 1. Set
the line of sight on the tangent by the spindle clamp and slow motion
screw. Set the alidade on 2. Measure from the instrument station a
station chord, and locate the next regular station on . the curve. Con-
tinue the curve as before.
To run the curve backwards to the obstruction, set the alidade on 2,
instead of 1. Set the line of sight on the tangent by the spindle clamp
and slow motion screw. Set the alidade on 1, so as to look back on the
curve. Measure from the instrument station a station chord and locate
the next regular station backwards on the curve. Continue the curve
backward the same as forward, except that lines 1 and 2 exchange places
in the order of their being used.
Where a plus station occurs, one-half the partial angle covered by
the chord to it may be laid off on either side of one-half the regular
angle, 1 m 2, as may be required, as was done for starting the curve.
Wishing to know the plus station that would come on a designated
line running from the instrument station, measure the angle (34) between
it and a line to the last station located, or between it and the tangent at
the instrument station. Call this angle \ dt.
Find n = \^-
i d
Reduce the decimal part of n to feet, or the units the station distance is
measured in. Add the resulting number and plus to the number, and
plus (if any), of the station where the plane table stands to get the num-
ber and plus of the station at the end of the line if $ dt was measured
from the tangent at the instrument station, or the last station located,
if reckoning from there.
Lay the angles out on the sheet with great care. Be especially care-
ful in setting the alidade to the lines on the sheet.

44. Laying Out Parabolic Curves. Fig. 10.—These curves may be
used where the tangents I A and I B are equal or unequal. The curve
cuts the equally spaced breadths 1-17, 2-26, etc., drawn parallel to the
line I M, joining I with M, the middle point of A B, so as
to make the following proportions. The distances 3-P3;
5-P5; etc., from the tangents I A and I B, and P2-26; P6-62; f ,j 10
etc., from the chord A B are equal, if equally removed
from I M. P4 is in the middle of I M. 1-P^ 2-P2; 3-P3;
etc., are in the ratios of the squares of the natural num-
bers. Pj-V7; Pa-26; P3-35; etc., are in the ratios of the
products of the natural numbers written from A to M,
the one at M repeated, and continued back to A, as in the
figure. This may be represented as follows:

Make an even number of divisions between A and IM.
Intersect the tangents A I and B I at I (33). Survey
and plat these tangents. Set up the plane table at I.
Locate the tangent points A and B at equal or unequal distances from I,
as may be desired. It may be well to vary the positions of A or B
slightly in order to make the spacings on the tangents, 1-3; 3-2; or 1-5;
5-6; etc., of a convenient length to lay out. Lay out and locate 1, 2, 3,
etc., onAI; and 5, 6, 7, etc., on I B, so as to divide each tangent into the
same even number of equal parts. Move the plane table to A. Set it
up at A and orient it by A I. Set the alidade on A B. Measure A B and
plat it. See if it checks on 6. If not, review the work and correct the
errors. Locate M, the middle point of A B. Locate points 17; 26; etc.,
on A B, so as to divide A B into the number of equal parts in both tan-
gents A I and I B. Measure I M on the ground and on the plat. See
that they agree. Divide 4-1 M by the square of the number of divisions
in the tangent A I, to get the unit measure for the work. Multiply this
unit by the ratio numbers formed as above noted to get the measure-
ments for locating points on the curve. Figure out both sets. Add
them in succession for the various points Pj; P2; etc. See if the results
are in proportion to the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, etc. If not, review the
figures and correct the errors. Stretch a cord, or tape, from 1 to 17.
Locate Pj on this line by the measurements for Pj. Stretch a cord, or
the tape, between 2 and 26. Locate P2 on this line by the measurements
for P2. So continue for each of the several stations. Plat them on the
sheet in the same manner. Measure from A to Pj; Pt to P2; P2 to P3;
etc., around the curve. Record these measurements.


THE TECHNIC.
To lay out a tangent at any point, as P3. Divide the number of the
point by 2. The quotient will show the number of spaces on A I, from
A to E, the intersection of the required tangent with A I; and the num-
ber of spaces on I B, from I to F the intersection of the required tangent
with I B. Measure off these spaces, and locate E and F. Run a line
from E to F. See if it passes through P3. If not, review the work and
correct the errors.
Any number of tangents may be laid out as above noted, the meas-
urements computed from them to points on the curve; and these used
in locating stations; either with respect to A B, or the chord joining the
tangent points of these tangents with each other, or with A or B. By
this means obstructions may be passed or difficulties overcome.
The station as P„ at which a tangent as E F is laid out, divides that
tangent into two parts whose ratios are expressed by the number of sta-
tion distances between the station and A and B. E P3 is f ths and P3 F
is f ths of E F. This principle may be used to avoid obstructions.
45. Direction of a Line. Fig. 11.—The direction of a line may be
found by observing stars at their elongations. The stars near the pole
are the most useful for this purpose. Their names and relative positions
can be readily learned from a star map or a cheap planisphere. This
will enable one to find the stars required for observation, or to tell the
stars that may be observed at any time. The apparent daily motions of
the stars are in arcs of circles. When a star is at that part of its daily
motion path, where it appears to move vertically, or follow the range of
a plumb line, it is at its elongation. At the eastern elongation it is
going upwards, at the western downwards. Western elongations are
more convenient for observation with ordinary instruments. The obser-
vation is an easy one to make, as the star moves in a nearly vertical
direction for some time. The observation consists in watching the star
near its elongation, and keeping the range of a line to it. Finally get
the direction of a line to the star when at its elongation. This is done
by following the star with the vertical cross wire in a telescope, or by
moving a compass sight on a level board, even keeping the star behind
a suspended plumb line, when watching it through the compass sight,—
or by any similar device. For further information regarding this kind
of work consult an article on the "Direction of a Line" in the Technic
for 1892.
Examine the plane table and find how large an angle of elevation
can be observed with the rule standing on the board when sighting.
Unless this angle considerably exceeds the latitude of the place of obser-
vation, a diagonal eyepiece will be required to the telescope. If com-
pass sights are used the observation will need to be made on an entirely
different plan.
To illuminate the cross-wires tie a piece of unglazed white paper
(common newspaper) over the objective by a string around the telescope
tube back of the lens, with a hole in the paper centrally over the objec-
tive. This hole may be from J" to \" broad. Light shining upon the


51
outside of this paper will make the cross-wires visible. A lantern with a
lens throwing light in one direction is best. A common lantern may be
made use of by nearly surrounding it with something to shut off the
light. The light must not shine in the observer's face. It must there-
fore shine obliquely from the side upon the paper over the objective.
The light may be toned to any faintness within the telescope by with-
drawing the lantern, or changing the obliquity of the beam of light.


THE TECHNIC.
Choose some point of the line whose direction is sought, or reference
line from which a clear view of the stars to be observed may be obtained
for an instrument point. Fasten a lantern at some other point of the
reference line to sight to. A common lantern about a mile away will do
very well. If necessary to have it nearer a fainter light may be made
by covering part of the lantern globe. This light should be faint enough
to look about like a faint star, so that no change of focus of the objec-
tive will be required.
In good season for beginning the observations, set up the plane table
over the instrument point of the reference line, with a sheet of paper on
for this work. Set a needle at the center of the sheet as a guide for the
edge of the rule. Turn the board so there will be room on the paper, or
the side towards the stars to be observed, and a good place for the plat
of the reference line. Clamp the spindle. Set the alidade on the refer-
ence line, sighting to the distant lantern, the cross-wires being illumin-
ated. Use the hands in setting the alidade, and keep the edge of the
rule to the needle at the center of the sheet. Draw a line from the
center of the sheet by the edge of the rule,—m- r, Fig. 11. Place the
alidade to look at a star, the edge of the rule being kept to the needle.
Direct the telescope to a star. Bring the star into the field of view of
the telescope by the hands. Illuminate the cross-wires. Set the vertical
wire on the star, using the hands and keeping the edge of the rule to
the needle at the center of the sheet. Keep this wire on the star very
carefully as it approaches its elongation, which may be known by the
increased time taken by the star to cross the wire. Follow the star,
moving the alidade with the hands, keeping the vertical wire exactly on
it till it appears to pass directly along this wire. Presently it will leave
this wire and go to the same side it came from. Follow it no longer than
till it passes directly along the wire. Draw a line from the center of the
sheet by the edge of the rule. Mark this line for the star observed with
a note of its elongation, east or west,—as m s, Fig. 11. Set the alidade
again on the reference line. See if m r fits the rule. If it does not fit
well this observation must be rejected. The nicety of the fit depends
upon the character of the work.
To save confusion on the sheet in case the rule does not fit m r, set
the edge of the rule to m r, and set the line of sight on the distant
lantern with the spindle slow motion screw as a preparation for the next
observation.
In case the rule fits well enough, but not exactly, draw a second line
by the edge of the rule and mark both for the star observed. If the
table stands still till time for the next observation mark the second line
for the next star.
Observe a second star as the first was observed. Draw a line marked
for it as m s'. Take a pointing again on the reference line as before.
Mark the reference line drawn on the board if it differs from the last,—
otherwise note the fact that the lines checked.
If there are two lines m r drawn on the sheet for the observation of


53
a star, draw a third line bisecting the angle between them for the line to
be used in making the reductions which follow, unless there is good reason
to take one of the original lines drawn,—if there is, use that line.
Observe three or more stars in this way, noting the line for each,
and the elongation of each.
The lines to the stars are to be taken in pairs and the position of the
meridian line found graphically. There may be as many results found
as there are pairs that can be formed from the number of stars observed.
Three stars will give 3 pairs and 3 results. Four stars will give 6 pairs
and 6 results. And so on.
Let Fig. 11 represent the lines needed in finding the position, mp,
of the meridian.
Take from the Nautical Almanac the apparent declinations of the
stars for the date of the observation.
If A0 = the azimuth of the star s and &lt;?0 = its apparent declination,
and A, = the azimuth of the star &amp; and &lt;5, = its apparent declination,
the following equations may be written.
Tan * (A, + A,) = tan | (A„ - AJ (cos &lt;5„ + cos d.)
v^" cos &lt;50 — cos 6X
Tan 4 (A — A ) = tan HA0 + At) (cos S0 — cos JQ
k 0 » cos d0 + cos S1
These equations may be solved graphically, being simple proportions.
Bisect the angle * m s' by a line m c. Lay off m o equal to ten parts
of some scale, as large as may be. Draw s s' perpendicular to m o at c.
Draw two indefinite lines a b and a d, making any convenient angle with
each other. Lay off af and af = natural cosine of &lt;f0, or any multiple
of cos d0 (in this case 4 was used) to the same scale m e was measured by.
Lay oSfe equal to the same multiple of cos d„ to the same scale, and
fe' = /e. Lay off a 1 = s e = s' o. Also 1, 2 = 3, 8 = 3, 4 = * c, if
desired. Join e and e'. Draw parallels to e e' through 1, 5, 3, and 4,
intersecting a d in hv ?h, h3, and h^, a hj should equal \ h2; h} hs; and
h3 ht. From c on * lay off op = a hv towards the line which marks
the star having the greater declination, because the star having the
greater declination will have the smaller azimuth from the north at its
elongation. Draw mp. p m r is the angle between the reference line
and the meridian.
By taking the stars observed in pairs, a separate result may be
obtained for each pair, and the final location of m p made more trust-
worthy. If the lines become too numerous and the drawing too compli-
cated, separate drawings may be made for each pair by pricking the line
m 1 and the lines for a pair of stars through onto a separate sheet, and
doing the drawing on that sheet. After the angles m r is found it can
be compared with the value on the original sheet.
There are four cases of this graphical solution. The reference line
m r may be between m s and m or not, as in Fig. 11. The stars may


THE TECHNIC.
be at the same elongation or at different elongations, as in Fig. 11. In
case the stars are at the same elongation the distance corresponding to
op will represent tan i (A0 + A,) and must be laid off from c towards
the place of the meridian mp, that is, to the left of e if the stars are
both at the eastern elongation, or to the right of c if at the western elon-
gation, when the direction to p is to the N. The circumstances of each
case will dispose of all ambiguity.
Lay off the denominator of the fraction in the second number of
either equation and the distance corresponding to s o on the same line.
Lay off on the other line that part of the numerator depending for its
value upon &lt;?0 and dv Join the points located by
functions of 60 and &lt;S„ and draw a parallel or paral-
lels to this line as required. A multiple of the
cosines is taken in order to bring e and e' a good
distance apart, s' c was laid off four times as a test
of the precision of the drawing. The lines a b and
a d should be open enough to give good intersec-
tions at ftj, ft,, etc., better than in Fig: 11.
The anglep to r may be measured (34), and the
work oriented with respect to the meridian. The
meridian to p may be laid out on the ground if
desired.
The meridian may be laid out on the ground
directly, without platting the lines on the sheet if
desired. After observing a star at its elongation,
point the telescope downwards and set a stake
marked for the star with a point marked on it in
line. Do the same for two or more stars, setting
the stakes as far away as convenient, yet near
enough for the points on them to be well located.
Reverse the telescope about its axis; shift the rule
to the other side of the needle at to; and level the
table anew after observing and marking the line to each star. Make notes
showing the position of the telescope when observing each star. In com-
bining the observations in pairs place together those for two stars for
which the notes show the telescope to have been in two different positions.
By so doing the imperfections of the instrument will do less harm.
If I in Fig. 12 shows the place of the plane table C and D, the stakes
for two stars, one at its E. elongation and the other at its W. elongation,
and I K the meridian, make the following measurements carefully,—as
with a steel tape. CD = i; I C = a; and I D = 6. Let x — CK, and
j = KD, the segments of C D between the meridian and C and D.
x + y = d
x — y — d
a cos i\ — 6 cos &lt;5,
a cos &lt;J0 + 6 cos &lt;S,


55
where &lt;5„ is the apparent declination of the star represented by C, and if,
the apparent declination of the star represented by D. Find x and y and
locate K with the plane table and steel tape. As a check on the figuring use
x _ a cos S0
y ~ b cos &lt;5,
when the stars are at the same elongation d = x — y and
, , a cos &lt;S„ + 6 cos 6,
x + y = d ° , j1 .
a cos o0 — 6 cos o,
In this case K will not come between C and D but to the right of D if
the stars are in the W. elongation, or to the left of C if in the E. elonga-
tion. Should D' be set in line from I to D so that I D' = I C = a, the
figuring would be simpler. Measure CD' = d', and
x' — y' = — d' tan £ (&lt;5„ + 6X) tan \ (&lt;50 — i,).
For the stars at the same elongation d' = x' — y' and
&amp; + y' - — &amp;' cot £ (d0 + &lt;y cot | (&lt;50 - &lt;!,).
An inspection of this last equation shows that stars having nearly the
same declination should not be used together, if observed at the same
elongation.
Since A0 = C I K and A, = D I K, the azimuths of the stars at their
elongations, C I D = A0 -f- A,. For the stars in the same elongation,
C I D = A„ — A|. Measure C I D with the plane table or compute its
value from the steel tape measurements. Then
Tan i (Aj — A,) = — tan i (A0 + A,) tan i (1!„ + &lt;!,) tan i (&lt;50 — ,\)
Tan i (A0 + A,) = — tan i (A0 — At) cot i (&lt;!„ 4- d,) cot i (&lt;50 — d,).
Observations on stars having nearly the same declination, made at the
same elongation, should not be combined.
The latitude of the place &lt;p may be computed as follows:
cos A, cos S,
cos * = —J = -—r-i
sinA0 sin Aj
Whence it appears that the direction of the meridian and the lati-
tude of a place may be found without reading angles. A0 and A, may be
found directly from the triangles CIK and D I K
In case a plane table is used having compass sights on its alidade the
direction of the meridian may be found as follows. Suspend a long
plumb line from a fixed support so high that the stars to be observed
will appear somewhat below the support. Use a large piece of stone or
some bricks for the bob, and let it hang in a vessel of water to steady the
line. Drive two stakes some distance S. of the plumb line, and nearly in
an E. and W. line. Saw off their tops to the same elevation. Nail a
smooth board on top of the stakes. The stakes should stand firm, at
such a distance S, of the plumb line that with the eye a little above the


THE TECHNIC.
board, the stars to be observed will appear below the support of the
plumb line. The length of the board should be 6 or 8 ft. if about 20 ft. S.
of plumb line. Level the board carefully, both ways. Remove one of
the compass sights from the rule of the alidade. As a star approaches
its elongation place the rule on the board with the compass sight to the
south, the rule pointing to the plump line. Looking through the com-
pass sight keep the plumb line over the star by shifting the alidade with
the hands on the board. Follow the star till it appears to pass directly
along the plumb line, and leave it again on the same side it approached
from. Illuminate the plumb line if need be by a light from behind the
observer. Follow the star no longer than till it passes directly along the
plumb line. Keep the rule pointing as nearly as may be to the plumb
line all the time. Mark the place where the slit in the compass sight
stands on the board and number the mark. Record in the note-book the
same number with the name of the star and a note of the elongation,
E. or W. Observe 2 or more stars in this manner. Measure the exact
distances of each of the marks on the board from the plumb line. Meas-
ure very fully the distances of each mark on the board from all the
others. Record these measurements. Reduce the position of the meri-
dian by calculations similar to those above given, remembering that the
triangle C I D, Fig. 12, lies S. of I. The point K may then be marked on
the board. The line from K on the board to the plumb line should be
very carefully produced by repeated sightings. This may be done with
a field glass if one is to be had, by driving a nail at K in the board, stand-
ing back a sufficient distance, and using the field glass to see that the
stake and nail beyond is set in line of K and the plumb line. Better pro-
long the line some distance S. of the board, and then N. of the plumb
line, setting stakes and nails in both directions.

SEWER PIPE TESTS.
PEOF. CHAS. E. GREENE.
The ability of a sewer pipe to withstand a load has been determined
in many cases by placing the cylinder horizontally on two blocks near
its ends and applying known pressures on the top of the pipe until frac-
ture occurred. At first sight it would appear that the action was that
set up in a beam supported at two points, and loaded in the middle, or
uniformly, as the case might be. But it is noted that the pipes break
into four longitudinal pieces; and they do not fracture transversely, as
should be the case if broken as beams.
The resistance of hollow cylinders to a single load at one extremity
of a diameter and an equal reaction at the other extremity will be
determined. The results are applicable to working loads on ductile


57
materials like steel, since then the deformation will be inconsiderable,
and are reasonably correct for breaking loads on such brittle materials
as cast iron and vitrified clay in the form of pipes. Exact calculations
might be made; but as the pipes are comparatively thin, in many cases
are not very homogeneous, and vary somewhat from the true circular
form, it has not been thought necessary to use the exact value of the
moment of inertia of a cylindrical ring or to take account of the socket.
If the pipe under test is moderately long, the socket will have but little
influence on the breaking weight.
If a circular pipe were supported at two points of its length I, and
loaded at the middle of the space with W, the maximum bending
moment would be i W I. The moment of inertia of a thin ring of thick-
ness t and mean radius r, about an axis through the centre and perpen-
dicular to its plane is 2 ir r t. r*, and the moment of inertia about an
axis through the centre and lying in its plane is one-half of the above,
I = 7t t. The half depth being r, and the unit stress on the extreme
fibre being f, the resisting moment fl-^r becomes fir r* t, which is to
be equated with £ W I. Then
W I _ W;
*~ iirr*t _ 4ST'
where S — area of circle of radius r.
If the load W were uniformly distributed along the span, the bend-
ing moment, and hence/1, would be but one-half as great.
If, on the other hand, the cylinder rests on the bottom element and
is loaded along the top element, it will fail, if brittle, by breaking into


THE TECHNIC.
four .pieces, the lines of fracture running approximately through the
top, the bottom, and the extremities of the horizontal diameter. If one
will press with his hand on the top of a moderately flexible hoop which
rests upright on the ground, he will appreciate the action of a ring or
cylinder under two such directly opposed, equal forces.*
The bending moment at any point N of the ring will be proportional
to the arm R N of the resultant force, the moments being of opposite
signs on either side of the points B, D, F and G, and having maximum
values at A, C, E and K as required by the tests. A bending moment at
any point N causes the tangent to the curve there to alter its direction
slightly. But, by symmetry, the tangent at A will remain horizontal,
and that at C vertical, when the circle suffers a small deformation.
Then the total change of direction undergone by the quadrant arc from
A to C must be zero By the application of this criterion the equilib-
rium polygon, or action lines B D and F G of the resultant forces, can
be located. These lines meet W at infinity, and thus answer the require-
ments of an equilibrium polygon
Let C I = a, the horizontal distance from the ring to the equilibrium
line at the extremity C of the horizontal diameter. Let 9 — the angle
included between O C and the radius to any point N. Then will N R,
the arm of the constant force i W in B D, be r (1 — cos 0) — a, which
will be of opposite si«rns on either side of B. If this expression is mul-
tiplied by r d 6, the length of an infinitesimal arc, and integrated from
C to A, its integral must be zero.

Bending moment at side = — 1 W X 0.3634 r = — 0.182 W r.
Bending moment at crown = }W(1- 0.36341 r — 0.318 W r.
The angle from O C to the points of contraflexure, or no bending,
G, B, etc., will be 50° 28', since its cosine is 0.6366. The ratio of the
two bending moments is 7 to 4, or If to 1, the greatest bending moment
being at A and B.
Since the resisting moment of a rectangular section of width I and
depth t is if I f, the maximum unit stress of tension or compression at
the crown will be
0.318 Wr. 6 _ W r

work on Resistance of Materials, soon to be published.

The maximum unit stress of tension at the side will be found on
the outside, if the following expression is positive,
W / r
w / r ,\
With ordinary ratios of thickness to radius, the unit stress is much
greater at the top and bottom than at the sides, and cracking of the clay
or cast iron pipe may first be expected at the former points; but failure
will probably immediately follow at the sides. For a ratio of thick-
ness to radius of \, the three values above become 68.76, 42.24, and
36.24 W I r, respectively.
If these values are compared with the stress from the resisting
moment for cross-breaking: or beam action, it will be seen that the stress
at A last deduced exceeds the cross-breaking stress. To make the two
stresses equal, it is necessary that
W 1 1 111 W r 72 34"
47rr2t ~ IP' ~ t'
As I in a cross-breaking test of sewer pipe will not exceed 20 inches, r
must be about 2£ times the thickness to satisfy this equation.
The fact is thus made clear that sewer pipes, resting on two supports
and loaded at mid-span, break in four longitudinal pieces, as previously
stated, not as beams, but as cylinders under two directly opposed forces,
and that tests for cross-breaking are not such in fact.
The safe thickness for any metal cylinder under like conditions can
be calculated from the above formulas; for the deformation under safe
stress will be very slight, unless the cylinder is very thin. A large defor-
mation will affect the shape of the curve to which the moment ordinates
are measured to so great a degree as to make the formulas valueless; but
much change of shape is not to be tolerated in any practicable cylinder.
The following results of tests will show the unit breaking stress of
several pipes from different manufacturers, deduced by this method.
The first five pipes were from one factory. They were not truly
cylindrical, and the mean diameter was used in calculating f, the values

24 inches.
The second set comprises samples offered in competition by different
makers, and tested by centre loading on two-inch bearings, 21J inches
span, centre to centre. As they all fractured longitudinally, the column
f has been computed as for a thin ring. If the formula for cross-break-
ing under a central load, developed at the opening of this paper, is
applied to the 15-inch pipe which broke under 3630 lbs., the value / of
maximum fibre stress becomes 78£ lbs., a result which shows that the
pipe does not fracture as a beam.
Further:—pieces of the fractured 24 and 20 inch pipes seven inches
wide were broken on two supports with a centrally applied load, and the

analysis.

pipes were better made, although the load carried at failure was less;
and that, if these pipes had been made a little thicker, they would have
excelled the others in breaking weights.

obtained by the above formula will be too large. Further, the experi-
ments appear to have been made with an hydraulic press, the gauge of
which would indicate a greater pressure than was experienced by the
pipe. These pipes were 2i feet long.
If four equal forces were applied at points 90° apart, the stresses at
A and C on the outside would be added algebraically, and similarly on
the inside circumference. As the moments at A and C are of opposite
kinds, the new moment would be but three-fourths of that now at C,
and about three-sevenths of that now at A. A number of pairs of equal
or unequal forces may be treated.
Thus, it can be seen why brittle sewer pipes, having considerable
compressive strength, can carry a heavy weight of earth if they are
reasonably well supported or packed at the sides. If laid in a clay
trench, unless good lateral support is given by gravel or sand packed
around them, the larger sizes are liable to fracture as above described.
As, however, the broken pipes cannot spread to any great extent later-
ally, they may still be serviceable.

THE TECHNIC}.
SOME PRACTICAL POINTS IN IRRIGATION ENGINEERING.
R. C. GEMMELL, '84 AND '95.
It will generally be conceded that at the present day there is too
much talking and writing, and too little actual working, done in the
world, and the writer has serious doubts of being able to offer anything
for the readers of The Technic that will be of value; but, in an unguarded
moment, he promised to furnish a paper upon the subject of irrigation,
and there is now nothing to do but to try to keep the promise. Some
10 or 12 years ago, when irrigation engineering in this country was in its
infancy, there was little or no literature published upon the subject,
comparatively few canals had been built, and reliable information as to
duty of water, losses by seepage and evaporation, allowable maximum
and minimum velocities, etc., was hard to get. An attempt will be
made to give a few practical hints to the young engineer regarding irri-
gation surveys and construction.
RECONNOISSANCE.
As a general rule, the first that an engineer has to do with an irriga-
tion project is when he is called upon by the promoters for a preliminary
report. It is a well known fact—alas!—that Americans are always in a
great hurry, and frequently it is a hard matter to persuade the promoters
to allow one time enough to make a reconnoissance—usually surveys
are wanted at once. It is safe to say that a reconnoissance is always
desirable; therefore, insist upon it with all the firmness and tact at your
command.
Let us assume that the engineer has succeeded in proving the advisa-
bility of a reconnoissance. It will be well to take one of the promoters
along. Secure good saddle horses, if possible. Take along a note book,
a good aneroid barometer, hand level, small pocket tape, and the best
map of the country that can be found. The writer is well aware of the
limitations of the aneroid barometer, but believes that by using it prop-
erly in connection with a hand level, it is a valuable instrument for some
purposes. Be careful always to read it in the shade, and tap it gently
before reading. Always note the condition of the weather, as, if a
change accurs between two readings, the result obtained is likely to be
in error. Do not waste any time in traveling between points, and after
stopping at any point for any length of time read the barometer before
leaving, to be sure that it has not changed while at the point. Endeavor
to arrange to go over the ground twice, " checking back" on elevations
of controlling points. Make note of the date, time of day, direction of
the wind, etc., as the information may be necessary for future reference.
Usually, it will be best to start at the highest point on the ground
which the canal is expected to cover, and to make the reconnoissance


63
through to the stream from which the water is to be taken. In riding
over the ground endeavor to follow as closely as possible to the probable
line of the proposed canal, and to get the " lay of the country " clearly
fixed in the mind. Get all the information possible regarding the dis-
charge of the stream, make note of whatever general information can
be picked up as to water courses that have to be crossed, corners of the
government land survey, best camping places, etc. With proper effort,
th6 engineer should be able to pick out in a general way the best line
for the canal; and, if the country be fairly well settled up, he should
have no difficulty in laying the line approximately Upon his map.
So far as the reconnoissance is concerned, the question of the rate
of grade is one of small importance. This will vary from 0.5 ft. per
mile for large canals to about 5 ft. per mile for small canals, in ordinary
soils. A rough guess at th9 rate of grade will be close enough for all
practical purposes.
Sometimes it may be found advisable to select a diverting point
further up the stream than is required by the grade line, either for the
purpose of securing a better diverting point or additional elevation. In
the arid region the streams generally flow in canyons, more or less deep,
rocky and precipitous, and it is always advisable to get away from them
and out of the canyons as quickly as possible. Occasionally it will be
found that by placing the diverting point a little further up stream the
line of the canal can be laid through some " saddle" or a narrow ridge,
and the length of canal and cost of construction be reduced, the true
grade line being afterwards reached by putting in a drop at the proper
point. A proper reconnoissance should make the engineer thoroughly
familiar with the country and enable him to save time, money and
worry when he comes to make the surveys.
PRELIMINARY SURVEYS.
Having made the reconnoissance, the engineer is now ready to make
the prelimary surveys, which usually require that only sufficient work
shall be done to enable him to report upon the probable length of canal,
cost of construction, and area that can be irrigated. This being so, it is
hardly necessary to use the old-fashioned method of employing 9 or 10
men to make the surveys. The transit is the only instrument needed.
Measure the distances by using the stadia wires and carry the levels
with the level bubble of the transit. The party will then consist of 4 or
5 men. If the country is somewhat settled, a camp outfit will not be
needed and the work can be done by four men—the engineer, transit-
man, one rodman, and a teamster, who also acts as a stakeman. Usually
an axe man is not needed, as, except for the first 1,000 or 2,000 ft., the
survey will be made upon ground covered by low sage-brush or grease-
wood.
The transit should be of the best, fitted with stationary stadia wires
cutting 1 ft. on the rod for every 100 ft. of distance, a vertical circle or
arc, and a gradienter. The vertical circle will not be needed, except


THE TECliNib.
when it may be necessary to run the line over a narrow ridge. Two rods
are needed. They should be similar to the ordinary cross-section rod,
but not so wide, and as light as is consistent with stiffness, plainly grad-
uated to feet and tenths, with the foot figures 0.08 ft. and the tenth
figures 0 06 ft. high. One rod should be fitted with two targets and the
other with one. An axe, hand-axe and stout canvas bag complete the
outfit. The axe can usually be left in the wagon, as it rarely will be
needed. The bag is to be used for carrying stakes and hubs and should
be provided with a strap, so that it may be slung over the shoulder.
The hubs and stakes may be of one-inch stuff, the hubs about 2 in. wide
and 6 in. long, and the stakes about 2 in. wide and 18 in. long. The lum-
ber of which the stakes are made should be surfaced one side.
By means of the reconnoissance, the engineer will have generally
determined the proper point of diversion from the stream, and the sur-
vey can be started there. First, however, select a place where the stream
flows in a reasonably uniform and straight channel for 50 or 100 yards.
Measure off 100 ft. at this place along the bank of the stream, and take
a cross-section at each end and in the middle. Then, by means of floats,
measure the maximum surface velocity of the water, being careful to
start the floats far enough above so that they will have attained the
maximum surface velocity by the time they pass the upper section. By
taking care, and using the best information obtainable as to the relation
between maximum surface velocity and mean velocity, a fairly good
guess as to the discharge of the stream at that time may be made.
The survey may now be started, the approximate size of canal and
rate of grade having been previously decided upon. The engineer car-
ries the two-target rod, selects the points for the hubs, takes the stadia
readings and — sight level reading, keeps notes of the stadia readings,
of the topography and of the classification of materials. The transit-
man keeps the alignment and level notes, and sees that the engineer
selects his points upon, or close to, the grade line. The rodman carries
the one-target rod, gives the backsights for the alignment and the -f-
sight level readings. The stakeman drives the hubs and clears away the
brush around them, and marks and drives the witness stakes as directed
by the engineer. Usually the line is fitted very closely to the ground,
and the hubs average only 500 or 600 ft. apart, no intermediate stakes
being set. When the sights are short, the transitman reads the rod for
the level readings; when the target is used, the engineer marks the
level rod reading on the witness stake in small figures, for the transit-
man's notes.
This will prove to be a very satisfactory method of running prelim-
inary surveys for canal work. Points should never be selected over
about 1,000 ft. apart, and the engineer should not forget to add the focal
length to the distances as obtained by the stadia readings. At first
blush, it might seem that the method is a slow one, on account of the
frequency of the "set ups;" but a fair trial will soon prove that it is not.
The greater part of the length of a canal has to be constructed upon


65
curves, and no matter what method is used in preliminary surveys, a
great many angles are necessary, as compared with railroad surveys.
An average of one mile of line an hour can be run over fairly good
ground, and, at the same time, all the information necessary for the
reports and estimates can be obtained.
WATER SUPPLY.
Assuming that the report based upon the preliminary surveys is a
favorable one and that the projectors decide to go ahead with the enter-
prise, the engineer should at once proceed with an investigation as to
the discharge of the stream from which the water is to be taken. A great
many of the streams of the arid region have been gaged since 1888 by
the Irrigation Division of the Geological Survey, and perhaps the stream
in question may have been one of them; if not, then a gaging station
must be established at or near the diverting point. Perhaps a weir may
be found, already in, at some point; if not, one should be put in, if the
stream is not so large as to render the work too expensive. A gage
should be set with the 0 mark at the same elevation as the crest of the
weir, and some one living near at hand must be employed to read it at
least once a day. If a weir is out of the question, then measurements
must be made by means of .cross-sections and floats. Instead of using
floats to measure the velocity, a current meter should be used if one
can be had. A gage can be set and arrangements can be made for daily
readings. The ratios of maximum surface velocities to mean velocities,
under various circumstances, may be obtained approximately from the
diagram given below, marked Fig. 1.
RATIOS OF MEAN VELOCITIES TO MAXIMUM SURFACE VELOCITIES; AND HEAD
REQUIRED TO GENERATE DIFFERENT VELOCITIES.
Diagram 1. Computed by Bazin's formula. Take hydraulic mean
depth on bottom horizontal scale and find ratio of mean velocity to
maximum surface velocity on left hand vertical scale.
Diagram 2. Head required to generate different velocities. Take
velocity in feet per second to be generated from bottom horizontal scale
and find the velocity head required on the right hand vertical scale.
The flow should be measured at different stages of the stream
between high and low water, from which a curve of discharge can be
constructed so that the discharge of the stream for any reading of the
gage can be noted at a glance. Care must be taken to note the changes,
if any, in the form of the channel at the gaging station.
If it is possible to obtain the gagings of the stream for one season
only, some idea of what may be expected in the future may be obtained
by a study of the precipitation records of the Weather Bureau, coupled
with a study of the condition of the water shed during the rainy season
previous to the time during which the stream was measured. To further
elucidate this statement, let us assume a circumstance that may occur.
Permanent streams are supplied by springs. In the arid region there
are two seasons as regards precipitation - the rainy season and the dry


THE TECHNIC.
season. The rainy season usually begins in November and lasts until
April or later, but sometimes it does not begin in earnest until Decem-
ber or January, after the ground has become frozen. For the purposes
of illustration, let us assume that this was the case during the latter
part of the year 1895, and that the gagings cover the year 1896. Let us
further assume that the records for the rainy season of the latter part
of 1894 and the early part of 1895 show that the precipitation then was
less than the average. We would then be pretty safe in assuming that
the gagings for 1896 show a smaller discharge than need ordinarily be
expected. For, during the summer of 1896, we could expect to receive
Fig. 1.
very little benefit from the light preciptation that fell during the rainy
season of 1894 and '95; and the precipitation for the rainy season of 1895
and '96, having fallen upon frozen ground, did not have a fair opportu-
nity to penetrate the soil, but ran off during the early part of 1896.
This is one case; others might be given.
This subject of water supply is a very important one, and too much
information npon it cannot be obtained. Too many irrigation and power
canals have already been built, and too much money wasted, without
definite information having been first obtained upon this point. Con-
siderable time is generally spent by the promoters in securing money
for the enterprise, and advantage of this should be taken by the engineer
to study the question of water supply thoroughly.


07
DUTY OF WATER.
This subject, like the one preceding, might easily consume the
entire space allotted for this paper, for its proper discussion, but it can
be covered only in a general way in this article.
For irrigation purposes, the flow of water is usually stated in cubic
feet per second, although a great many water users talk nothing but
"miner's inches." This latter method is a very indefinite way of stat-
ing the flow of water, as there are a great many different miner's
inches. It is a barbaric relic of the early days in California, and proba-
bly served its purpose well enough at that time, but should not be used
now by engineers. A cubic foot per second may be taken as being equal
to about 50 miner's inches under a 4 in. pressure, or to about 38.4 miner's
inches under a 6 in. pressure.
The duty of water is usually expressed by the number of acres of
land that a cubic foot per second, or second-foot, will irrigate. The duty
varies widely with circumstances. It depends upon the manner of con-
struction of canals and flumes, upon the kind of soil through which the
canal is constructed, upon the locality and nature of the ground to be
irrigated, upon the kinds of crops raised, upon the way in which the
water is delivered to the crops, upon the intelligence of the handling
after delivery, etc. In some localities and for some crops, 12 inches in
depth, applied in four waterings, are considered sufficient; in other
localities and for other crops, 24 inches are thought necessary. The
duty is sometimes as low as 50 acres per second foot, with poor construc-
tion of canals and careless handling; and sometimes as high as 1,000
acres per second foot, where the pipe system of distribution and sub-
irrigation are employed.
The loss by seepage and evaporation must be taken into account.
This will depend upon the nature of construction, the length of canal
and the kind of soil through which it is constructed. It may be as low
as 10%, or it may be as high as 60%. Again, it is to be remembered
that not all of the land under the canal will be irrigated; usually it is
safe to estimate that not over three-fourths of it will be irrigated dur-
ing the same season. It is always best, however, to have too much
instead of too little water, and in matters of doubt, "take the safe side."
Further discussion of this subject will not be attempted here. Suf-
fice it to say, that the engineers in the West have adopted, as a rule of
thumb, a duty of 100 acres per second foot.
CROSS SECTIONS AND GRADES.
Ordinarily, the best cross-sections and grades for canals are those
which result in making the cost of construction a minimum, though
this is not always the case. The determination of these questions
requires study and judgment. As a general rule, on steep side-hill work
it is advisable to make the canal narrow and deep, and to regulate the
grade so that the water will have as great a velocity as the material will
stand without erosion. For light, sandy soil, a mean velocity of 2 ft.


THE TECHNIC.
per second gives good results; for firm, sandy loam, the mean velocity
may be increased to about 3 ft. per second; while in firm gravel or rock,
the velocity may be increased to from 5 to 10 ft. per second. A mean
velocity of less than 2 ft. per second should not be used, on account of
the deposition of silt and the growth of weeds; and for brickwork or
rubble masonry a velocity of 15 ft. per second should not be exceeded.
For a general rule, in ordinary soils, a velocity of about 2.5 ft. per sec-
ond is probably about right.
The most economical cross-section is one with vertical sides and a
breadth equal to twice the depth of water, but it can only be used in
solid rock or for flumes. For earth the trapezoidal form is best, with a
depth of water of about one-half, and a breath of water surface of
about twice, the bottom width. The slope of the sides of canals varies
between 1 to 1 and 4 to 1, but generally 1| to 1 is all right. Main canals
SECJIOf/ Wl] f^OlJj Bl\fA
Fie 2
are generally built on grade contours along sidehill slopes, entirely in
cut on the uphill side, partly in cut and partly in fill on the downhill
side. In distributing ditches the water surface should be a little higher
than that of the adjacent ground which is to be irrigated,'and the chan-
nel is partly in cut and partly in fill on both sides. Sometimes a berm
is left between the cut and the fill. The width of berm is from 2 to 6
ft., and the top width of embankment is from 4 to 10 ft, according to
the size of the canal. Some ideal cross-sections are shown below:
The use of a berm as shown above, with a shallow depth of water
flowing over it, is of doubtful value, however, as the velocity in the
shallow portion would be so low as to be liable to cause the deposition of
silt and growth of weeds.
Having determined the cross-section of canal, the grade required to
produce the proper velocity may be found by the use of the now well
known Kutter's formula. This part of the work can be lightened by
using the diagram given below, marked Fig. 3;


69
FLOW OF WATER IN FLUMES AND DITCHES.
To find requisite fall for ditch of given cross-section in order to
obtain a specified velocity, take mean depth on vertical column and
immediately below intersection of curve of specified velocity with hori-
zontal line through mean depth, find proper fall for ditch. To find
velocity corresponding with given cross-section, find fall on lower hori-
zontal line and mean depth on vertical scale and at intersection of
vertical and horizontal lines, passing through these values, find the
resulting mean velocity, interpolating between the velocity curves for
the result desired. In using the diagram for flumes, proceed as above
excepting that the fall is found on upper horizontal scale. The curves

This diagram is compiled from Kutter's formula with "N" for
flumes taken at .010 and for ditches at .025. Other values of "N" may
be used by adding or deducting proper percentage from results obtained.
LOCATION SURVEYS.
The form of cross-section and grade of canal having been decided
upon, the canal may now be located. There are several ways of doing
this part of the work. In the early days of Utah surveying instruments
were not to be had, and the principal instrument used in laying out irri-
gating ditches was the plow. Starting at the point on the stream where
the water was to be diverted, the farmer would plow a furrow along the


THE TECHNIC.
hillside, following a grade contour as closely as possible. If the water
followed the plow in the furrow, well and good; if not, the farmer would
start over again at the point where the water had ceased to run, and
plow a new furrow on a steeper grade. Sometimes a straight edge, one
rod long, and a carpenter's level were used, setting pegs every rod and
giving the ditch a fall of from ± in. to i in. to the rod. These primitive
methods resulted in giving too much fall to all the ditches built during
the early days.
A method frequently used by engineers is the one used generally in
making location surveys for railroads, often called "a paper location."
Ten or twelve men, constituting the transit, level and topographical
parties, run a preliminary survey and take the notes from which a con-
tour map is made. Sometimes two lines are run and all of the ground
between them is contoured. The line of the location is then laid upon
the map, and afterwards staked out on the ground. This method may
be proper for large canals, but for small canals and those of ordinary
size, the writer believes it to be slow and costly, and is doubtful about it
giving as good results as may be obtained by the method he will now
describe.
The instruments needed are a level, rod, 100-ft. tape, a few lath, axe,
stakes, etc. By the ideal cross-sections of the canal already made, the
engineer knows what the cuts should be on the downhill side forsidehill
ground with slopes of 2 to 1, 3 to 1, 4 to 1, etc. Starting at the divert-
ing point, it is usually best to do some heavy cutting for the first few
hundred feet, in order to get away quickly from the bank of the stream.
This being accomplished, the stakes can be set for the lower side of the
canal at the proper elevation above the grade line of the canal bottom
by means of the level, rod, and tape. A lath should be stuck up along-
side each stake, so that the engineer can straighten up the line with his
eye, from curve to curve. The laths are to be pulled up and carried
along to be used again. Stakes should be set every 50 or 25 ft. on
curves, following closely to the surface of the ground on grade contours.
There is no advantage to be gained in laying out curves with mathemat-
ical exactness on canals of ordinary size. Sometimes it may be better
to locate the center line, instead of the lower side, of the canal. About
3 miles of line per day can be located over good ground, and experience
has shown that this method gives good results, with a minimum expen-
diture of time and labor.
SUGGESTIONS.
Considerable care should be exercised in the selection of the divert-
ing point, but this matter cannot here be treated at length. The site
should be selected at a point where a permanent weir can be built at
reasonable cost, and the weir must be long enough to pass floods without
backing up the water so much as to cause damage. If possible, the
headworks should be located at a point where the stream has a straight
reach for some distance above, so that it may sweep past them with a
minimum deposition of silt. Put sluice gates in the weir directly


below the headgates of the canal, so that the bar that is sure to form at
the mouth of the canal may be easily sluiced away. Put sluice gates in
the canal a short distance below the hbadgates, and at all crossings of
streams.
In making ideal cross-sections on paper, for use in the location work,
provide an excess of excavation over embankment of about 20%. A
frequent mistake in location is the one of not having enough material
from the cut to make the fill. "Borrowing" in canal work is hardly
permissable, except where the canal is purposely built in embankment.
Bench work for flumes should be entirely in excavation, as experience
has proved that it is not good economy to build flumes upon embank-
ments.
It is a difficult matter to make and keep flumes tight. The use of
double thicknesses of lumber for the bottoms has not proved satisfac-
tory. Sometimes the planks are groved on each edge for the insertion
of a tongue. Some engineers prefer to leave the edges rough, and to
simply press the plank together with a crow bar before nailing, claiming
that the seams will soon silt up and become tight. Special care and
ingenuity must be used at junctions of flumes and ditches to make the
connections tight; and do not forget to allow the necessary velocity
head at the entrance to flumes, where the change is made from the
large area of the canal to the smaller area of the flume. If the finances
of the enterprise can stand it, wood stave pipe should be used instead of
flumes. At all crossings of deep gulches, inverted siphons of wood
stave pipe are preferable to high trestles and flumes.
NOTES ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF PIPE SEWERS*
H. E. KIQGS, CIVIL ENGINEER, TOLEDO, OHIO.
When I was asked some time ago by Professor Greene to prepare a
paper for you, I had in mind giving you an outline of the history of the
sewerage of Pontiac and a description of the work of construction of
main sewers. Owing to complications at that time unforseen, I cannot
carry out my original plan and am compelled to offer a few notes on
methods of construction and on our mode of handling certain perplexing
problems, and add a few words in the nature of a general discussion of
pipe laying.
I assume that some of you will at some time have an active part in
the construction of sanitary works, and that all of you feel, or will feel,
an interest in the proper construction of sewers; if not as engineers, at
least as citizens and tax payers.
I do not think that any branch of engineering work is so little
understood or so poorly executed as sewerage has been in the past.
* Paper read before the Engineering Society of the Univ. of Mich., April 30th, 1897.


THE TECHNIC.
The history of Sewerage Construction is very ancient. The Cloaca
Maxima, or main outfall sewer of Rome, dates back over 2,400 years, and
is in use to-day for the purpose for which it was built. There seems but
little doubt that the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem was not only
equipped with a complete system of sewerage, but that the sewage was
carried to settling basins, or cesspools, and after sedimentation the sewage
was used for irrigation.
Many other examples might be cited to show that the ancients had
considerable knowledge of the principles of sanitary engineering, but
time forbids. During the Middle Ages, in common with nearly all other
learning, sanitary science had a relapse. Little or no work was done.
A feeling developed that such subjects were not to be discussed by any-
one of standing. That they were too filthy to be considered. Hence we
find that sewers came to be mere cesspools where all manner of filth was
deposited and retained. The condition of Europe was very unsanitary
and the death rate became enormous. Then came the reaction, and out
of it have grown our present systems of disposing of the waste conse-
quent upon the gathering of large populations in a limited territory.
We have to-day two distinct systems of sewerage. The Combined,
which disposes not only of household and manufacturing wastes, but
also of storm water and ground, or sub-surface, water in one system of
conduits; and the Separate System, which provides for the groundwater
and storm water in one system of pipes and house sewage in another.
For convenience, I will term the system of pipes for house sewage
and manufacturing waste as sanitary sewers, thus distinguishing them
from the storm water conduits of the Separate System.
Of the Combined System I will say nothing except that it is in very
general use in this country, and while to my mind generally not desir-
able, there are many places where it will have to be maintained and
there are also localities where its use may be proper and economical.
The Separate System is rapidly growing in favor. Its advocates no
longer feel they are offering something new or untried. The people
begin to hear of it from other sources than the engineer recommending
it. Many examples can be cited, and its adoption is the rule rather than
the exception where an experienced engineer is consulted.
The advantages of the Separate System, briefly reviewed, are as
follows:
The size of conduits to carry off organic filth are dependent, not
upon the amount of rainfall to be taken care of, but upon the domestic
consumption of water in the district. They are consequently much
smaller than the sewers of the Combined System and can be designed
with much greater certainty of successful operation.
The pipe being smaller—grade and volume of discharge remaining
the same—the depth of flow and velocity are greater; hence solid matter
is carried off much more rapidly than in the large sewers.
The amount of sewage, being dependent upon population and amount
of water consumed, varies only within certain limits, and the flow may


be said to be practically uniform; hence in times of extreme dry weather
there is no tendency to solid sewage standing or clogging in the pipes
and decomposing, giving off gases and odors not only annoying but
dangerous. This, to my mind, is one of the strongest arguments against
the Combined System.
A last argument, usually advanced in favor of the Separate System,
and far from the least in the eyes of common councils, is that in nine
cases out of ten it will be found the cheapest—storm water being car-
ried by the most direct lines to the nearest streams.
In the construction of sewers of the Separate System, it is generally
desirable to exclude all ground water from the pipes. This is necessary,
as the ground water not being under control, the amount is uncertain
and it would be necessary to greatly increase the size of pipes.
From a sanitary standpoint, it is generally better to take off the
ground water, and there is no objection to taking it in the sanitary sys-
tem on grounds of health. It is merely a matter of cost and expediency.
It will readily be seen that to permit any considerable leakage will
impair the strength of the joints, as if ground water has much head, it
will surely increase the size of the openings in the joints.
The City of Pontiac has discussed sewers for several years. In 1889,
plans were prepared by W. S. Parker. Later, Prof. Greene submitted a
report. No final action, however, was taken until 1895, when it was
decided to build and bonds were issued. George S. Pierson made a
report on sewerage, but was not retained as engineer. A local man was
employed, and he prepared plans for a system of main sewers following
very closely the plan proposed by Mr. Parker.
Construction was commenced in October, 1895, and the limit of time
in which the first three miles were to be done was set at August 1, 1896.
From October, 1895, to September 1, 1896, five different engineers
were in charge of the work at different periods. On the latter date, the
writer was retained and was informed that he must build dry sewers.
At that time, scarcely one-third the entire work on main sewers was
finished. Wier measurements showed that ground water was admitted
to the amount of about 200,000 gallons per day in the one mile then
built, and it was confidently predicted that it could not be stopped.
The specification under which we were wor*king was practically the
same as given by Staley &amp; Pierson in the "Separate System of Sewer-
age," the only modifications having been made by an attorney member
of the Board of Public Works, all of which were in the nature of a
decided improvement.
No underdrain was being laid and no means had been adopted to
keep out water, except the oakum and cement provided for by the speci-
fication.
After a few days, in which time cement tests were made, it was
decided to use a quick-setting cement in connection with the " Milwau-
kee" which .had been in use. It was found that the "Milwaukee
Cement" mortar if mixed in a pat and exposed fifteen or twenty min-


THE TECHNIC.
utes to air, then placed in water, would at once disintegrate and crum-
ble. In no part of the work did the mortar actually used have that
much time to set, as the water rose in the trenches several feet, and
after the backfilling' was begun the water would at once rise over the
pipe. It was generally difficult for the pumps to keep dry a section of
over twenty-five feet ahead of the pipe layers. We commenced using a
mixture of Milwaukee and Lisbon Hydraulic Cement. The latter we
found would not disintegrate if it had two minutes in which to set in
air before immersion. This cement alone is too quick for use, as it is
difficult to cement even one joint before the cement begins to set. A
mixture of equal parts of the two cements was found to be a good
proportion, as it does not set quickly enough to cause much danger of
cracking, and yet does not disintegrate when water rises around it.
The next move was to commence the lapping of joints with ordi-
nary cheap sheeting. This was bought by the bolt, torn into strips nine
inches *n width and of sufficient length to tie readily around the joint.
In work where a comparatively small amount of water is encountered,
this affords great protection to the joint and is ample to secure the
cement in place until it is thoroughly hardened.
On one branch, we had constructed perhaps five hundred feet in
comparatively good ground, when we met trouble—Niagara broke loose.
For three weeks water ran of enough volume to half fill an eighteen-
inch pipe. There was no noticeable diminution at that time. The con-
tractor had no pumps capable of handling it, and as he was beginning
to feel financially unable to handle the work, it was delayed. Finally a
six-inch stream syphon and two hand pumps were rigged up and we
commenced work. If you can picture to yourselves an eighteen-foot
trench in sand and gravel, the bottom composed largely of boulders the
size of a man's head, with water pouring out of all the interstices—
often in streams two inches or more in diameter—the banks caving in
by reason of the impossibility of driving sheet piling as fast as digging
proceeded, and with water rising in the earth as soon as it was filled in
over the pipe—often to a height of several feet—you can form some
idea of the character of one kind of bad work.
This commenced at a time when it was impossible to begin under-
drains. Plank foundations were useless. We could not keep concrete
in the trench, as cement washed out immediately if we placed it in the
bottom, and our pipe joints met the same fate. To excavate below
grade seemed impracticable, as we could not drive saddle piles. One day
was spent in fruitless effort, and that night the writer decided upon a
method which was successful. The trench was excavated about 7 inches
below grade; small drain tile were laid on each side close to the sheeting
to carry back water ahead to the pumps; stringers of 4" x 6" x 16', pine
were laid in the trench supported on mudsills, where necessary, and sad-
dles—from 2" x 4" pine—cut out to fit the outside diameter of the pipe,
were spiked onto the stringers, two for each length of pipe.
This arrangement accomplished the same end as the saddle piles


described by Col. Waring and to whom I am indebted for the idea;
namely, it kept our pipe above water until the cement became set. We
then concreted under the pipe and up to the middle and carried a ring of
concrete oyer each joint, the small drain pipe serving to relieve the
pressure on the concrete until it is thoroughly set. We have turned the
drain pipe into the manholes and allowed them to flow for several weeks
in order to permit all cement and concrete to thoroughly harden, after
which they are plugged up.
We have encountered other classes of wet and difficult work besides
that just described, but none so annoying, Of genuine quicksand, we
have had but little. Only 120 feet of pipe is laid in quicksand. Over
1,500 feet is in a very fine water sand, which runs almost as readily as
quicksand and which has been quite as annoying. Either one has been
raadily handled by using tight sheeting, the lower section—in the case
of quicksand—being cut in short lengths, driven down deep and left in
the trench. Sometimes we have planked the bottom; sometimes not—
all depending upon what appeared most judicious at the time.
There is no great difficulty in laying good pipe sewer in such ground
if the trench is kept of good width and care is taken to confine the quick-
sand. Trenches too narrow to work screw jacks, or poor sheeting, are
fatal to the contractor.
The question has been frequently asked, why do you not use the
methods laid down in the specification. The frequent repetition of this
has led me to question some methods which are often prescribed. We
all recognize the fact that a specification is drawn to cover a very con-
siderable range of work, but it may, and often does, not cover all con-
tingencies which may arise. It should clearly define the end sought and
should prescribe means which may be used, but should be elastic enough
to permit the engineer to use other means if he sees fit. Such a clause
as this for instance: "The bottom of the trench must be made and
shaped to fit the lower half of the pipe being laid, with holes cut at the
bottom for the sockets to rest in." This is hollow mockery in Pontiac.
I can imagine clay where this could be done, but we have not had 200
feet of such ground. Where it can be done, what opportunity have we
for packing the pipe so it will not settle? It is frequently specified that
no cement shall be put in the bell of the pipe before the entering pipe is
laid and the gasket of the next joint is completed. I do not question the
desirability of this practice, but taking the two clauses together, tell me
how it would be done in a bottom of fine sand, perfectly hard and suit-
able for foundation, but with water seeping in everywhere and causing
the sand to run so fast as to fill the socket hole before one gasket could
be made, to say nothing of two; or in a rotten clay, where water rises so
rapidly that you would be compelled to keep a man with a sponge at
each joint. As in everything else, the doctors disagree in this, as you
will see by consulting different specifications.
I believe there are times where it is best for the work to permit each
joint to be cemented as the work proceeds.


The successful construction of sanitary sewers depends, above every-
thing else, upon the perfect laying and jointing of the pipe. All the rest
of the work is but the means to that end. It is necessary to keep true
line and grade and have joints that will absolutely not leak.. It might
be well to add that enough "Y" branches be laid that no man should
ever have occasion to break into a sewer. The question of how joints
are to be made is a good field for thought. The kind of gaskets, the
kind of cement, are capable of pretty full discussion, but it may surprise
some of you to know that in this age anyone would prefer clay to cement.
Last fall, I found that we got better results by cementing and packing
with puddled clay than by any other means. We have had frequent dis-
cussions as to the merits of clay, and one member of the Board—a man
with a good practical knowledge of construction—favored it rather than
cement. I recently read a copy of a paper presented by R. S. Rounth-
waite at the Congress of the Sanitary Institute, at Newcastle on Tyne,
last September. (Industries and Iron, Sept. 11, 1896). In it he advocates
the use of clay as a jointing medium in preference to "Portland"
cement, and he makes a strong case. I will briefly state his arguments
against cement:
1st. Unless we have better inspection than is usual, cement will
not be wiped out from the inside of the pipe and the least carelessness
on this point will impair the value of the sewer.
2d. Walking, or stepping, on cement joints is apt to break them,
and with greatest care this cannot be prevented.
To this cause given, I would add the danger of disturbance from
back filling, pulling sheeting and many other causes.
8d. We have no guarantee that the weight of earth, or unequal
settlement, does not fracture the joint.
4th. In case of fracture, leakage is almost certain to take place and
must eventually result in subsidence of pipes.
5th. Difficulty in repairs.
6th. Danger of using poor cement.
Mr. Rounthwaite advocates clay mainly on the ground that it will
permit of slight yielding, will not fracture and will prevent leakage.
His paper contains a considerable number of answers to questions
put to engineers, which go to show a much more general use of clay in
England than writer had supposed.
The Pontiac work is still several weeks from completion. The con-
tractors are still in charge, although it has been an extremely bad piece
of work for them and they will be at considerable loss of money as well
as time. I cannot give you the data I wish as to cost, as some work
will undoubtedly be condemned and it is impossible to foretell the extra
work required. To give you a general idea. The original work was let
for $18,000.00 in round numbers, for three miles of pipe sewers; 300 feet
of this was 10-inch.; 3,400 feet, 12-inch.; the balance 18-inch, 20-inch,
and 24-inch. The average cut on the first mile is about 18 feet, the
maximum cut 28 feet. The total extras, consisting of concrete, extra


77
foundations and tile and a few manholes, will be less than $1,000.00, or
the whole work —including engineering —will run not far from $1.50 per
foot.
I believe that several good lessons can be drawn from this work—
not only by engineers but by members of boards entrusted with the
construction of such work.
In the first place, no work on a system of sewerage should be done
until a complete topographical survey of the town and surrounding
district be made and a complete set of plans, maps and profiles prepared.
This work is now being done at Pontiac after the main sewers are con-
structed, and it is pure good fortune if we do not find some sections of
the city that will not drain into the sewers now built. A hue and cry
was raised that the sewers were too deep; but even with a slight grade,
some parts of the upper levels of the main sewer will be less than five
feet below the surface. To build a system of mains and then leave sec-
tions of the city without sewerage is a more expensive thing than a few
thousand dollars for engineering. If you are ever on a Board of Public
Works, demand a complete set of plans, even if only a very small part
of the work is to be built.
In the next place, it is a mistake to secure a local engineer to pre-
pare plans unless he has had experience in this work. He may learn
much in a short time, but the community generally pays dear for his
schooling.
A local man can learn more and make more money out of sewers by
holding back until the plans are made and act as engineer in connection
with a more experienced man to consult.
One chief difficulty about sewerage is the dense ignorance of the
people in regard to it, and the all-prevalent feeling that most work is
done just as well by a contractor without inspection as with it. This is
not true. No class of work needs closer watching. An inspector of
pipe sewers needs to be on hand at all hours and needs the backbone of
a piston rod to be successful.
The generally ignorant class of men we find employed on such works
affords full explanation of this. A man who works simply because he
wants dollars, who has no knowledge of what he is doing, or why he is
doing it, no interest in the work nor pleasure in it, cannot be made to do
honest, conscientious work in sewer building without close watching;
and the men often set to watch them as inspectors are not much better.
A poor inspector will destroy the work of the best engineer.
My idea of an inspector is that he should be bright, keen and quick;
thoroughly honest, and not bashful. He must demand good work and
cause all poor work to be immediately taken out and done over. He
should be down in the bottom of the trench while pipe laying is in
progress, and should personally see every joint made, cemented and
wiped. He should be able to judge of each pail of cement as it comes
down and detect any deficiency. He must see that no cull pipes are laid.
He should be able to judge by the way the pipes lay whether any grade


THE TECHNIC.
given from above is correct, and in case of doubt, he must make sure he
is right.
A good inspector can find plenty to do above when pipe is not being
laid. Keeping trenches full width, inspecting sand, cement, pipe, brick
for manholes, and other material, and at all times keeping close tab on
the men back filling—in short he is a busy man all day. He needs, as
his tools, prompt decision, a good temper, and a pot of white paint with
which to mark cull pipe, as chalk marks come off too readily. Upon the
inspector depends everything, and I would say that no books can teach
you as much as a few months work in this position.
I have endeavored to keep clear of points which are fully discussed
in most works on sewerage, and emphasize those which are not touched
upon at length. To briefly summarize:
In the construction of a system of sanitary sewers, it is necessary to
have joints which will not leak, as ground water will necessitate larger
pipes, or impair the value of your system.
All work done must be so done as to secure the best results in pipe
laying. The efficiency of the system depends upon the joints and
manner of making, granting of course that all designing has been
properly done.
The one man on whom the burden falls is the inspector, and his work
poorly done will destroy perhaps the value of thousands of dollars worth
of work.
Some very interesting lines of study open up in the discussion of
methods of jointing. Cement, clay, pitch, and a number of patent joints
are to be chosen from, and the best course is a very open question.
In closing, I would say that I consider the field of sanitary engineer-
ing to be far from full. We need more honest, earnest workers. We
need men who will do a dollar's worth of work for a dollar. We need
plans as carefully prepared as we would have for a bridge, or for a build-
ing, or for any other structure. Unfortunately, too many men have
entered the field and sent out plans which were a credit to no one, col-
lecting the best of fees. Others take advantage of this, and for a paltry
pittance turn out work as bad, or worse, and for a time keep work away
from the men who, by experience and study, are qualified to best execute
it. This sort of slighting of work will not pay, and no man who has the
broad liberal foundation of a college education, backed up by industry
and a practical knowledge of the work gained by actual contact with it,
need fear the final outcome. There is plenty of room for good men and
no engineer of repute fears the competition of those of the same sort.
Those who do not enter this field have an interest in it, as the proper
execution of sanitary works saves large sums of money and many valua-
ble lives. The old Greek philosopher spoke well when ne declared that
the necessities to health and happiness were
"Pure air, pure water and a pure soil."

GOOD ROADS.
DAOTEL B. LUTEN, '94.
A nation's progress in civilization may be judged by the quality of
its roads. The highways of the United States are as a rule, worse than
those of any of the other great nations. But fortunately for our nation's
reputation, our highways are not the whole of our road system, and our
magnificent railroads, second to none in the world, redeem to some
extent our miserable highways. The prosperity of the railroads depends
largely upon the condition of the highways that act as their feeders, and
it would seem that such extreme development in steam transportation
could hardly have taken place without a corresponding improvement in
methods of subordinate traffic. The fault lies in our methods of road
improvement. The policy of allowing the residents of a district to work
out their road taxes under the direction of a pathmaster who is not even
a paymaster, to say nothing about his ability in road-building, is almost
as unwise as would be the working out of the school-tax by allowing each
person taxed to teach the district school for an assessed number of days.
The construction of highways requires engineering knowledge and skill,
and their maintenance requires constant attention besides.
In most of the states of the union, the residents of country districts
are assessed their road-taxes in day's work, which may be performed by
the person assessed or by a hired substitute. A payment of $1 for
each day assessed relieves him from the road-work. The valuation of
the total assessed road-tax for the State of Indiana at the above rate is
$3,000,000 per annum. 60,000 miles ot highways in the State receive
thus an annual appropriation of $50 per mile. Yet it is safe to say that
an expenditure of $10 per mile under wise supervision would keep our
dirt and gravel highways in better condition.
The present method is wasteful, slovenly, unscientific; it places
material where it is not needed; it piles the center of the highway with
gravel, leaving the compacting and levelling to traffic; it is forever
filling mud-holes, and never draining either surface or road-bed; in short
it is the method of a pound of cure when an ounce of prevention or a
grain of common sense would have accomplished a better result.
France has a system of highways and highway construction that is
almost ideal. Government control is its basis; department engineers
have complete supervision of all constructions and repairs; all improve-
ments are planned and superintended by their assistant engineers; con-
tracts are let to the lowest responsible bidder; and repairs are made by
men who are hired to look after a certain piece of road for the year, very
much after the system of section-hands on our railroads. Piles of road
material are placed at frequent intervals along the road and carried in
wheelbarrows to the points where repairs are needed; the stone roads are


THE TECHNIC.
swept and sprinkled during the dusty season. It is by such a method as
this that highways can be economically maintained in a high state of
perfection.
American methods are slowly tending in the same direction. State
legislatures have come to recognize the benefits of good roads, and are
making appropriations for their improvement. New Jersey and Massa-
chusetts have passed laws permitting the cost of construction of new
roads to be paid jointly by the residents along the improved highwa}',
the county containing the road and the state. And appropriations of
several hundreds of thousands of dollars have been found necessary to
keep the state's portion of the agreement. This system must succeed,
if the superintendence of the improvements is placed in trained hands.
Let a state engineer be appointed or elected whose duties shall be to
superintend the planning, writing of specifications, and making of esti-
mates, of all proposed improvements of highways and bridges. Let
each county surveyor be an assistant engineer having subordinate con-
trol of roads and bridges in his county. And with no increase in the
burden of expense now borne for highways, Indiana would in five years
be supplied with a system of roads that would make her residents won-
der why they had stuck in the mud for half a century.
Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to convince the average citi-
zen that a bad road is a more pregnant cause of hard times, than the
tariff or the money question. He usually considers it better policy to
pay $100 per annum for keeping a bad road in repair, than to invest
$1,000 in permanent improvement and $60 in repairs, when money is
bringing 4% interest. Because he says it is bad policy to go in debt.
Forgetting that a bonded county is unlike a mortgaged farm in that the
residents will always prefer to be taxed a small sum for interest rather
than a large sum for repair, and that as long as the interest is paid there
need be no danger of foreclosure.
Another point still harder to impress is that the bad road is a con-
tinual and needless tax, a drain on the country's resources.
The cost of transportation by horse and wagon on country highways
may be assumed to vary directly as the traction required on the various
surfaces. This cost of transportation includes only the wages of team
and driver. The items of wear and tear of wagon and harness, of horse-
shoeing, of injury to horses, etc., being like the driver's time, some of
the quantities that regulate wages, they will all be included in our
assumed standard of wages.
The traction force required to move one ton on the different kinds of
level road surfaces is approximately as follows:
Iron rails 9 lbs
Asphalt 15 lbs
Brick :25 lbs
Macadam in excellent condition 40 lbs
Macadam in ordinary condition 60 lbs


Granite block 60 lbs
Gravel in excellent condition 60 lbs
Gravel in ordinary condition 100 lbs
Gravel, spread loosely 300 lbs
Earth, dry and hard 90 lbs
Earth, average condition 150 lbs
Sand, wet 175 lbs
Sand, dry 800 lbs
The wages for team and driver in the country at the present time
may be taken as $3.00 per day of ten hours.
The power that one horse can exert for ten hours is usually consid-
ered to be about 20,000 foot pounds per minute. At the rate of three
miles per hour then, one horse can exert a tractive force of 75 pounds,
and can maintain that rate of speed and that tractive force for ten
hours per day.
A team and driver then at $3.00 per day will be able to exert a pull
of 150 pounds for 30 miles, supposing the team urged to its best exer-
tions. In other words that will be the maximum efficiency of the team.
In general teaming where the load is hauled in one direction, the
team returning without load, where grades decrease the allowable load,
and where economy of time and labor is held lightly, it certainly can-
not be greatly in error to say that the average pull actually exerted by
the team would be 100 pounds rather than 150, a decrease in efficiency
of 33%.
Assuming such to be the case, the cost of exerting a pull of one
pound for one mile will be one-tenth of one cent.
The cost of transportation per ton-mile may deduced then from the
preceding table, resulting as follows:
Iron rails $0,009
Asphalt 0.015
Brick 0.025
Macadam in ordinary condition 0.060
Granite block 0.060
Gravel in ordinary condition 0.100
Gravel spread loosely 0.300
Earth, average condition 0.150
Sand 0.200
The first cost of a pavement as well as the annual cost for repairs
varies greatly on account of fluctuations in wages, cost of materials,
expense of location, etc., so that it is a very difficult matter to give even
an approximate table of values. The following table has been collected
from various text-books of highway construction, reports of city engi-
neers, and of government engineers in foreign countries. At best it can
give but a comparison of cost and maintenance of the various pavements
under average conditions.


THE TECHNIC.
In any particular case, the first cost should be estimated, and the
cost of maintenance should be taken from data concerning similar roads
under the same conditions if such data are obtainable.
The roadway is taken as 16 feet in width.

Macadam, 8 inches

Let us now compute the cost to the community of transportation
and maintenance for one mile of the various pavements.
Let x represent the total tonnage of wagons and loads, not including
teams, passing over the mile of road per year. Then the cost to the
community would be the tonnage multiplied by the cost per ton-mile,
plus the interest on first cost at 5 per cent, say, plus the annual cost of
maintenance.
For the Dirt Road—
0.15 x + $200 X 0.05 + $50 = cost.
For the Gravel Road—
0.10 x + $2,000 X 0.05 + $75 = cost.
For the Macadam—
0.06 x + $4,000 X 0.05 + $400 = cost.
For Brick on Sand—
0.025 x + $12,000 X 0.05 + $500 = cost.
Equate the costs for dirt and gravel roads; the resulting value of x
will be the limit of tonnage that can be economically transported over
the dirt road.
0.15 x + $60 = 0.10 x + $175.
From which x = 2,300 tons.
Under the conditions of first cost as given, the dirt road will be more
economical than the gravel for traffic of less than 2,300 tons per year, or,
on an average, perhaps 10 teams per day.
Comparing Gravel and Macadam—
0.10 x + 175 = 0.06 x + 600.
x = 11,000 tons.
Macadam versus Brick.
0.06 x + 600 = 0.025 x + 1,100.
X = 15,000 tons.


83
For the given conditions then a dirt road would be most economical
for traffic of from 0 — 2,300 tons per year
Gravel Road 2,800 — 11,000 tons per year
Macadam 11,000 — 15,000 tons per year
Brick 15,000 tons per year
At 3,000 tons per year, however, the iron rails become cheaper
than gravel, and hold their own against all other forms of pavements
as far as direct economy to the community is concerned. But other
features of the iron rails are objectionable, such as difficulty in passing,
danger of horses slipping, etc.
Macadam or brick pavements may be laid on the right hand side of
the road leading into town, to a width of eight or ten feet; the left hand
side may remain a dirt or gravel road for light traffic in dry weather,
and to give greater ease to the horses. The first cost and maintenance
may be very much reduced in such cases.
The average taxpayer will be inclined to doubt the computed bene-
fits accruing from the use of such expensive pavements. For instance
let us assume first cost and repairs as above, and let us compare the
expense to a community of a mile of dirt road and of a mile of gravel
road, assuming a traffic of 15,000 tons per year.
For the Dirt Road—
0.15 X 15,000 + 200 X 0-05 + 50 = $2,310
For Gravel—
0.10 X 15,000 + 2,000 X 0.05 + 75 = $1,675
For Macadam—
0.60 X 15,000 + 4,000 X 0.05 + 400 = $1,500
Showing a saving in favor of macadam as compared with the dirt road
of $635 per year, in spite of its first cost of $4,000 as compared with $200
for the dirt road.
But when one sees upon the completion of such a road the increase
in prosperity, the enhancement of real estate values, the increase of
traffic, increased loads, and time saved, he realizes that a bad road is a
penny wise and pound foolish investment.


THE TECHNIC.
SOME COMMENTS ON THE ESSENTIALS OF BICYCLE
DESIGN.
E. H. ERHMAN, '88.
To the average person one Chinaman has about the same appear-
ance as another, and, if among-a group of his fellow countrymen it is
doubtful if he could with certainty be distinguished; and one might be
pardoned if he had a suspicion that even the Celestials themselves would
have the same difficulty. Having no especial interest in the Chinese we
know only their general characteristics.
So it is to many people, a Chinaman is a Chinaman; a negro is a
negro; a horse a horse; a buggy a buggy, and a bicycle a bicycle; each
of its kind may have its individual qualities, rank, and peculiarities that
should distinguish it from all others, but we judge it by its class only;
since we know the class but not the individual.
There was a time shortly after the appearance of the present form
of bicycle when the several makes of machines were easily distinguish-
able one from the other, the shape of the frame, the front fork, the
style of seat and spring, etc., giving an individuality to each maker's
product. In fact about the only points of resemblance were in there
being two wheels of about the same size and a crank-shaft between
them.
Of late, especially since the pneumatic tire and the diamond frame
have come into general use, the individuality of the bicycle is to a great
degree lost, and, in its stead, we have chiefly differences of model and
design from season to season.
The bicycle of each year has its features that serve to distinguish it
from those of all other years, but each make resembles in general the
other makes for the same year.
It is in the details that the bicycle of to-day is able to preserve its
individual identity and the manufacturers have striven to make some
one or more of these conspicuous enough to enable his wheel to be
easily discernible among others.
Some do this through the name plate, some through a crown plate,
while others would have one " see that curve" in the seat post tube at
the crank hanger, or notice the elliptical spring cranks on the machines
of their manufacture, as the case might be.
The color of the enamel together with that of the rims and the
nickeled portions of the fork has served a ready means of identification,
but with the strife for fine finish and gaudy colors and the consequent
variety of finishes in the effort to obtain something different, this means
of maintaining a bicycle's individuality is not so reliable as it has been.
It is, however, in the details of construction more than in the finish
that the maker now finds " talking points" in selling his product. Im-


85
provements will always be made as the art advances, but manufacturers
are producing new features so rapidly in order to be up to date with fads,
that all new features must not be taken as improvements. If through
the experience of a year the sentiment is adverse to some feature, some
newer features will be added as " improvements" over those of the past
season and in this way errors will be corrected and real advances made.
To some of these "features" mention in brief will be made, but it
is especially to points in design that comments will be directed. Com-
ments they will be, largely, as lack of space prohibits a thorough
analysis of everything on which they are made.
Attention will be given chiefly to the essentials: bearings, driving
gear, and frame; and as the bearings are the parts most talked of they
will be noticed first.
Ball Bearings.—Ball Bearings have come to be classed according
to the number of points of contact between the ball and the ball races.
Figs. 1, 5, and 8, show respectively 2-point, 3-point, and 4-point bearings.
The 2-point bearing is very generally used, and, if well designed and
made, runs quietly. Compared with the 3-point, it may be questioned
whether it is its equal or not.
If a ball bearing could be perfectly constructed, it could be adjusted
so that each ball would at all times just fill the space between the


THE TECHNIC.
races of the cone and cup, and be held in its place by its contact with
the cone and cup without the aid of any other support. Practically,
such a condition is impossible, hence some freedom of the balls must be
allowed in order to avoid binding.
In reality but two or three balls at one time are in working contact
with the cup and cone, the remainder idly rolling or sliding in their
course, pushed by the two or three that are for the moment bearing the
load.
As all the looseness of the bearing is on the side opposite that hav-
ing the load, the balls, in pushing along, will get out of their course a
trifle as shown by the dotted circles in Fig. 1 and have to be forced back
into place as they near the working side of the bearing. This forcing or
crowding is done by the wedging action of the faces C and D. It will be
seen that this causes an undue pressure on the cup and cone close to the
proper track of the balls, and tends to produce grooving in both cup and
cone.
This wedging of the balls makes the bearing run hard, but at the
same time quietly. It is very noticeable that a bicycle hub with ordin-
ary 2-point bearings will, if held in the hand by the axle, spin a greater
length of time and more easily with the axis of rotation perpendicular
than with it horizotal; in the first position the balls are all in working
contact with the cup and cone, and in the second but two or three are
taking the load while the remainder of the balls are idle.
Another bad feature about this bearing is, that if the dimensions of
the cup and cone vary, the angle of contact of ball and bearing also
varies. In Fig. 2 are shown parts similar to those in Fig. 1 except
that the race on the cone is smaller in diameter, while in Fig. 3 the race
on the cone is larger. Besides allowing the cone to sink into or protrude
from the cup which is a matter of looks only, there is caused a greater
pressure on the bearing in the one case (Fig 2), and a liability of side
shake in the other (Fig 3).
Still another point to consider is the difficulty of grinding the races
of the cups and cones, after being hardened, and retaining their proper
shapes and relative sizes.
The 3-point bearing has been very much in favor the last few years;
with some few, perhaps because it is different from what had preceded it,
with others because in it they see a much more mechanical bearing.
The more common form of 3-point bearing is shown in Fig. 5. It
will be seen that the balls are confined within the three surfaces—two
in the cups and one on the cone—and that so long as the angles they
make with each other are not less than the " angle of repose" or about
10°, there can be no wedging or cramping of the balls.
The balls in a hub with this bearing, when the hub is rotated on a
horizontal axis, may be heard to click as they freely roll over the cone
and drop against those below them.
Another good feature about this bearing is the fact that variation in
the relative diameters in manufacturing, does not destroy the truth of


87
the bearings and furthermore as the elements of the ball-races are
straight lines the cups and cones are easy to finish on the grinding
machine after hardening.
Fig. 6 shows a bearing in which the direction of the pressure of the
balls against the cone is nearer the normal to the axle than is that in Fig.
5. It is preferable to that shown in Fig. 5 for another reason, and that
is, it will run more easily when worn. The track or race at F, should it
become badly grooved through wear or the softness of the cup, would, on
account of its position, affect the ease of running very much more than
when the points of contact of the ball with the cup are located as in
Fig. 12.
To obtain the correct proportions and proper angles of the races of
this pattern of bearing as well of the 4-point pattern it is well to make
a drawing four or eight times the actual size of the bearing.
The inside diameter of the cup is first determined to suit the size
and number of balls and the clearance between them, then the outlines
of the cup and ball are drawn.
To find the angle of the cone, project a line through the points E
and F to its intersection with the axis and from this point draw a tan-
gent to the circle at G. The angle 6 is the angle of the cone which was
to be found.
In the bearing shown in Fig. 6 it is probable that the angles of the
surfaces of the cone would be determined first and the angle of the cup
race sought from the diagram.
As it may be of some interest, a table of inside diameters which
was taken from a bicycle trade journal together with the formulas for
determining them and the angle of the cone is given below. These are
particularly applicable to the types of bearings shown in Figs. 5 and 6,
but may also be made use of to determine the diameter of the circle
which is the locus of the ball centers in some special ball bearing, that
may be under consideration.

An attempt Is made in Fig. 9 to analyze the 3-point bearing. The
outline of the ball is shown in dotted lines, the inscribed frustum of the
cone H J I rolls in the races of the cup J and I while the circumscribed
frustum of the cone H K is in rolling contact with the cone at K. The
elements of both parts of the roll J K I, together with its axis of rotation,
meet at H in the axis of the bearing. The balls are virtually double
rolls, but made to their actual shape of a sphere for the sake of accuracy
and so as not to require any ring or device for keeping their axes in the
proper position relative to the bearing. Similar analysis of the other
styles of 3-point and 4-point bearings might be made with interesting
results.
Modifications of the 3-point bearing have been made for the purpose
of reducing the wear on the cone. It will be seen that as the cup (in the
hub of a wheel) rotates and the cone is fixed, the wear in the former is


89
distributed along the race, while the wear on the cone is confined almost
entirely to the lower quarter of the race. As the race in the cup in a
9-ball bearing is almost twice the length of that on the cone, and as
only one-fourth, or less, of that must take all of the wear, it follows that
the wear on the cone will be in the neighborhood of 8 to 10 times that
on the cup. Probably it will exceed this limit as the pressure on the
cone is greater than in either of the races in the cup, since it is equal to
the resultant of those pressures.
So it is with this idea that two races have been made on the cone
and one in the cup, and it gives practically double the wearing surface
on the former where it is most needed. Fig. 7 illustrates a type of this
style of bearing.
Here it may be well to refer to Fig. 4 among the illustrations of
2-point bearings which shows a construction analogous to that in Fig. 7.
That is, the arc of the ball race on the cone is but little larger than the
ball, in order to have a closer contact with the balls; it also keeps the
balls in their course better than a race such as those in the cones in
Figs. 1 to 3. The arc of the cup race is made proportionately large so
that any slight variations in the diameters of the cup or cone do not
affect the angle of contact a so much as in the other designs (Fig. 1).
About 4-point bearings little need be said, as they have not been used
extensively since the old ordinary bicycle went out of use.
In that machine it was a bearing well adapted to the purpose, used
as it was, at the end of the front fork, and taking the axle of the large
wheel. It is what might be called an inflexible bearing, and maintains
itself in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the axle without depending
on the rigidity of the fork.
Its application to steering-head bearings of the present form of
bicycle is no doubt an error, as in it the axis of rotation of the ball is
normal to the axis of the bearing, while the 4-point bearing is only well
adapted to the construction in which the axis of rotation of the ball is
parallel to the axis of the bearing, or nearly so.
The point is purely one of the accuracy of the diameters of the ball
races in the two parts of the bearing. Referring to Fig. 8 it may be seen
that if the corresponding races are not exactly the same diameter the
pressure of the bearing is on the opposing races L and M, and the cups
may be rocked one on the other, and form in this condition a very
unsatisfactory bearing.
Passing from the bearing itself to its use in the bicycle, but one
point will be considered; the relative positions of the cups and cones.
Within the past year or two the idea of "inverting" the bearings
has become a favorite with many manufacturers and a fad with a large
portion of the bicycling public, and as "inverted bearings" have been
looked upon as a great improvement over the older form, the writer is
prompted to analyze the two forms briefly and compare them.
Fig. 10 shows the standard form of crank-shaft bearing, and Fig. 11
the inverted cup form,—that is, the cones are between the cups. This


THE TECHNIC.
arrangement has been adopted largely to simplify the construction of
the two-piece crank and shaft which is also quite popular at present.
In making the comparison, for the sake of simplicity, let the only
external force be the pull N of the chain on the sprocket tending to turn
or rock the axis of the shaft as indicated by the arrows P. An imagin-
ary fulcrum is taken at the middle of the length of the shaft and the
effect of the couple due to the force N is alone considered.
In the one case (Fig. 10) it will be seen that the direction of pressure
of the cones on the balls as indicated by the arrows O, O, is approximately
parallel to the course the cones would take (as shown by P, P,) if the
shaft's axis were free to rock and further that the cones and cups are in
a good position to withstand any such tendency of the shaft to rock.
In the other case, however, where inverted cups are used (Fig. 11),
the direction of the pressure of the cones against the balls as shown by
the line Q is in quite another from that of the arc P, where it starts
from the point of contact of the cone with the balls. The pressure
against the balls must be greatly in excess of what it is with the other
arrangement insomuch as the point of contact between ball and cone,
in moving with the rocking shaft, must move a greater distance in the
direction of P than normal to the surface of the cone; in other words it
produces a wedging action against the balls, and at the same time
allows the shaft to rock more than in the first case. An exaggerated
case is shown in Fig. 12 in which the cones are placed closer together
and the adjustment is loose. The nearer the cones are placed together
the worse the action becomes, showing at least, that a great distance
between the bearings is necessary to the rigidity and life of the bearings.
It will be noticed that while the two circles of balls are the same
distance apart in both cases (Figs. 10 and 11) the distance between the
races on the cones in Fig. 10 is greater than in Fig. 11 and that the
sprocket is close to the bearing in Fig. 10 while in Fig. 11 it overhangs
it considerably. In short, the conditions in the first case give assurance
of a rigid bearing while those in the second indicate probable excessive
wearing of the bearings, besides a tendency to rock, which may to
some extent explain the creaking not infrequently heare in "inverted
cup" crank shaft bearings.

Sprockets and Chain.—While graphically analyzed on paper a
sprocket gear may be simple, and it is simple because all the assumed
conditions are perfect, it becomes a matter for serious study in reality,
when mixed with its poor mechanical relation—the chain.
From the time the sprockets and chain are mated and begin their
run in life, the chain stretches and with its ally grinds out the lives of
both itself and the sprockets.
The worst element to contend with in chain and sprocket gearing is
the continuous "stretching" of the chain. Chains lengthen from i inch
to over 1 inch during a season's use. If i inch be taken as an average,
and that is very low, the increase in pitch of a 50 inch chain of 1 inch
pitch would be inch. If but 2 or 3 links were in contact with as
many teeth of the sprocket at a time as is the case in spur gearing, the
matter of changing pitch would not matter much, but as one-half the
number of teeth of a sprocket are in engagement with the chain at one
time the difference in pitch becomes aggravating. A sprocket having
24 teeth would have 12 in contact with the chain whose 12 links are each
1.01 inches long, or in all about 12£ inches, which have to be crowded
into the 12 inches, the half circumference of the sprocket. It does it by
"climbing" the teeth of the sprocket and wearing them away.
But thanks to the fad for large sprockets! for by their use the stress
on the chain is lessened and with it the danger of stretching; and the
end of the season of 1897 will witness the running gear of the '97 bicycle
in much better condition than did that of 1896, the machine of that year.
As to the sprocket, its value depends on the accuracy of its pitch
and to some extent on the shape of the teeth; for a good sprocket will
withstand the wear of the chain fairly well, while a poor one will help
wear itself away.
As to the shape of the teeth, illustrations 13, 14, 15, give some idea.
Fig. 13 shows the oldest form and has been largely replaced by the other
forms. Sprockets with large numbers of teeth are sometimes made from
this pattern as the tendency of the chain to climb the teeth in very large
sprockets is not great. The shape, however, is bad, because the straight
sides of the teeth form poor pockets for the chain blocks.
Fig. 14 shows a pattern largely used and one of good design. The
teeth are curved below the pitch line to the circle of the chain blocks,
thereby forming pockets which are deep and which fit well the inner
13
16
H


THE TECHNIC.
sides of the chain blocks. There is little tendency of the' chain to climb
the teeth if the pitch of the chain is the same as that of the sprocket.
If they differ, however, the link block will have a motiou like the pitch-
ing of a boat,—down the side of the tooth into the pocket and out again
up the side of the next tooth, thus rapidly wearing both chain blocks and
teeth. Two teeth R, R, Fig. 14 show the effects of such wear, the outline
having been made direct from a worn sprocket.
Fig. 15 gives the outline of another design that is much used, and
which is superior in some respects to the preceding form. The points of
the teeth are shaped somewhat on cycloidal lines and although, if chain
and sprocket match each other properly the links do not touch them,
they do come into contact with the chain when it has become stretched
and allow it to seat itself easily in the pockets.
The roots of the teeth are shaped to fit the link blocks as in Fig. 14,
but the bottoms of the pockets between the teeth are on a circle whose
center is the center of the sprocket. With the pockets this shape the
chain blocks rest in it so that the centers of the chain rivets are in the
pitch circle even though the pitch of the chain varies a trifle from that
of the sprocket, and the rocking movement of the links such as occurs
with the preceding shape of tooth is avoided. To accomplish this when
the chain is quite long in pitch, the teeth should be a trifle scant and the
space or pocket a trifle full, measured on the pitch circle. This gives a
small amount of back lash to the gearing, but it is no more objectionable
than the slackness of the chain between the two sprockets.
Below is appended the formula for obtaining the pitch diameters of
sprockets, also a table of such diameters published by the Brown &amp;
Sharpe Mfg. Co.
Reference is made to the diagram in Fig. 15. The formula is easily
deduced from equation B, page 25, Olney's Trigonometry (1883).

The chain driving gear of single bicycles is so simple that nothing
will be said about it. It may, however, be somewhat interesting to look
at the various arrangements of chain driving gear that are used on
tandem bicycles.
Fig. 16 shows a common design, in which two short chains are used
on the same side of the frame. It is a good arrangement inasmuch as
18
19
20
the pull on the front chain does not tend to pull the rear crank shaft out
of line.
In Fig. 17 there is but one long chain passing over the top of the
rear driving sprocket and around the other sprockets. It is held in
engagement with the middle sprocket by means of an idler.


The tECHNtc.
Fig. 18 shows a poor arrangement; for the pull of the front chain
tends to aggravate the tendency of the rear crank shaft to get out of
line (see Fig. 12), and in so doing increases the wear on its bearings and
on the chains.
Fig. 19 shows one of the best and safest arrangements,—that of one
chain on each side of the frame, both to sprockets on the rear hub. By
this means the pull on the latter and its bearings is equalized, and all
danger of springing the rear forks possible in the three preceding-
arrangements is avoided. Moreover, if either chain should break at a
critical moment, as for instance with hard back-pedaling, the riders still
have some control of their bicycle through the other chain. The only
objection is that the long chain is liable to sway, and needs idlers near
the rear crank hanger to keep it in line so as not to be caught by the
crank. Idlers, however, have always been looked upon as a nuisance, as
they add friction and usually make a noise.
Fig. 20 represents a safe arrangement of gearing, although it adds
weight to the machine and necessarily increases the friction on account
of the third chain. It might be difficult to make the two rear chains
drive equally on account of the unequal stretch or uneven adjustment.
It will be noticed that the width of tread (usually equal to the
length of the crank shaft) is the same in all of the front crank shafts
and in the rear ones in Figs. 17, 18 and 19, and may be made as narrow-
as in a single bicycle. In the rear crank shafts in Figs. 16 and 20 the
width of tread will be from f to 1 inch more on account of the space
needed for the second sprocket.
Frames.—The matter of stresses in a bicycle frame is one deserving
considerable study and particularly so in a tandem or multicycle frame,
and while some makers have given it the attention it demands, the large
majority have simply followed in the footsteps of the few, and built up
frames of the same appearance or perhaps gotten up shapes and designs
of their own that were novel perhaps, but possessed no real merits over
the accepted forms, and often were quite defective both as to design and
construction.
Defective designs are often atoned for by heavier tubing, stronger
joints or reinforcements, so that single bicycles of almost any of the
known designs of frame are ordinarily strong enough to be safe.
Tandems have been given more attention and the attempts to brace
and stiffen the frame are many, some of which are logical and make
"good talking points " in selling the machine, while others again add
more to the weight than to the strength of the bicycle.
As justice cannot be done the subject in a small space, no attempt
will be made to analyze the stresses or to go deeply into detail in going
over the designs outlined in Figs. 21 to 27.
The generally accepted designs for a single bicycle is shown in full
lines in Fig. 21. As the main part of the frame is a quadrangle, its stiff-
ness must depend upon the stiffness of the tubing and the strength of
the joints.


95
In some makes of machines a tie S, Fig. 22, or a strut T, has been
added and no doubt with increase of strength and stiffness. A frame so
constructed can be made of much lighter tubing as the latter has to
withstand compression and tension only, and not bending stresses.
There is a limit to the lightness of the tubing, however, which is reached
before it is really too light for its proper purpose, and that is due to
danger from transverse blows or pressure. Thin tubing is easily dented,
and dents in it are with more difficulty taken out than where the tubing
is heavier. And tubing heavy enough to withstand denting easily is
stiff enough for a frame without the bars T or S.
This may account in part for this design not being in more extended
use, although it is also likely that looks have had something to do with
the case, the additional tube giving the frame a heavy appearance.
In the drop frame there is no accepted pattern; each maker uses his
own ingenuity to so shape the drop bar as to give the frame the appear-
ance of strength. The drop frame shown in Fig. 21 is largely used and
gives one the impression that while the drop bar joins the seat mast
well up above the bracket for strength, it bends low so as to allow of
easy mounting. This is not so good a design, however, as show in Fig.
23. In the latter the drop bar meets the seat mast at U at nearly a right
angle and approaches closest to the lower bar near the steering head.
Being more nearly straight, it will afford a better brace than the drop
in Fig. 31,


THE TECHNIC.
The frame in Fig. 23 certainly appears much stiffer than that in
Fig. 21. All drop frames look weak at the point U, and would he were
it not for a long reinforcing tube within the seat mast and extending
well above that point.
While there seems to be a general demand for a low drop frame in a
single wheel, there is no reason for following the same design in a tan-
dem as many do.
This will be evident from Figs. 25 and 27. In the former pattern the
drop bar H passes below the line of the steering chain, whose position
is fixed, while in the latter the bar C is in the plane of the steering
chain. As in mounting one must step over this chain, it follows that it
is entirely unnecessary for the drop bar to be any lower than shown in
Fig. 27.
In some tandems the drop bar is carried low—some distance below
the steering chain as indicated by Z in Fig. 24, probably with the idea of
being continued by means of the tube W to the rear bracket, or across
the frame through D for the purpose of better bracing the frame.
While gain may be thus made, the frame is still weaker than it need be
in front of the forward seat mast.
In not a few of the new designs in diamond framed tandems that
have appeared this year, the bracing of the frame is accomplished by
tubes placed as V and D or V and W are iu Fig. 24, while the remainder
of the main frame is built up of quadrilaterals. Thus the strength of
the frame depends largely on the lower bracing and the strength of the
joints.
A much stancher frame, in the opinion of the writer, is the one
shown in Fig. 26, in which the frame is built up of triangles or quadri-
laterals with one side so short as to be neglected. Indeed by carrying
the tube Y back to the rear seat mast as might be advisable where the
frame is high, the lower part is entirely in triangles, making a well-
braced frame.
That the value of this construction is recognized, is shown by the
fact that racing tandems, triplets, etc., in which the greatest strength
is sought for the least weight, are almost without exception built on
these lines.
There is also a pleasing harmony in these lines as the braces Y and
E are parallel respectively to the top and diagonal bars of the frame.
In the combination tandem frame already noted (Fig. 27), the for-
ward seat mast and the rear steering head tubes are stiffly tied together,
so that the diagonal brace from the rear crank bracket, stands in a much
better relation to the bar C than at first glance appears, and the frame,
otherwise on about the lines of that in Fig. 26, approaches it in rigidity
as nearly as is possible for a combination frame to do.
Referring again to Fig. 25 it will be noticed that a brace L is put in,
parallel to the diagonal brace in the rear frame. The value of this brace
must not be over-estimated as it meets the reach, or bar between the
brackets in the middle, so that any stress in H must be met by the


97
resistance to bending offered by the tube or tubes forming the reach.
A brace such as W is worth far more, as it reaches to the bracket.
Nothing has been saidjabove about the stresses in the frame—par-
ticularly the lower part—due to the pull of the chain or chains, the pres-
sure on the [pedals, or rough road riding, as the strength necessary is
usually obtained by using heavier tubing in the lower part of the frame,
and in tandem frames by larger tubing or a pair of tubes between the
crank brackets.
The braces V and W are evidently placed low to stiffen the frame
sidewise as well as for the purpose already mentioned.
In concluding these comments attention is drawn to the fad which
many makers are obeying, that of making frames with flush or internal
joints. Not that such joints may not be as strong as outside joints, but
that there is a strong probability that they are not made so, aad for
several reasons:
First, because other things being equal the larger (or outside) joint
will be stiffer than the smaller (or inside) joint.
Second, the tubing can be cleaned much better on the outside than
on the inside, where it joins the fittings.
Also the brazing of an outside joint may be doue with greater cer-
tainty than that of an inside joint. In brazing the joints, flux andi
spelter are put inside of the tubing, so that one may know a joint is.
properly brazed when the spelter has run through aud shows itself on
the outside of the joints. This is much more easily and surely accomp-
plished when brazing outside joints than when doing inside joints.
Experience even this early in the season bears out the apprehension
that inside joints are not an improvement on outside joints, as cracks in
the enamel at the joints suggest something of what may be expected
to happen later should circumstances and accident tempt.
In closing let it be stated again in justice to the writer that the fore-
going are comments only and that the statements have been made for
the most part without the accompanying proof in order that a wider
range could be covered than would have been possible otherwise.
Most of the proof, if written, would have been based upon practical
tests and experience, although some might have been made through
observation and analysis.
But a few lines have been taken up and commented on, and these
because they relate to the essentials in bicycle design. Others perhaps
nearly as important and necessary in the physiology of the bicycle might
be interestingly considered by a person of wide enough experience and
ability.

THE ELECTROSTATIC CAPACITY OF A TWO WIRE CABLE.
The electrostatic capacity of telephone cables is a matter of great
importance. The distance over which the telephone can be used, other
things being the same, is dependent practically on the product of resist-
ance and capacity. For this reason it is desirable that the practical
engineer should understand the effect of dimensions and materials on
the capacity of cables. It is my purpose briefly to derive the expression
for the capacity of a single wire cable and from that pass on to the
capacity of a two wire cable.
Let us consider a system of coaxial cylinders a. b n, of indefinite
length, and ranging in size from a of small radius ra, to n of large
radius r„. Suppose a to be a conductor charged with m units of elec-
tricity per unit of length. The surface of each cylinder is an equipoten-
tial surface of the system. To determine the electric intensity (force on
unit charge) at any point distant r from the axis, a well known property
of equipotential surfaces may be used. The equipotential surface passing
through the point may be supposed to be replaced by a conducting sur-
face in communication with the inner conductor. The electric charge
will spread over this surface giving a surface density a equal to m -=- 2 ir r.
The electric intensity at the point is4ir&lt;i-^K = 2m-i-f K. whereK
is the dielectric constant of the medium. The difference of potential V
between any two equipotential surfaces is the line integral between them
of the electric intensity. This line integral, while the same for any such
line, is most easily computed along a radius of the system. Its value is
and the capacity C per unit of length of a condenser having a and n for
its plates, is
This result is in C. G. S. electrostatic units and Napierian logarithms are
to be used. It is more convenient to use the practical electro-magnetic
unit, the microfarad, and common logarithms. For which purpose (2)
must be multiplied by the modulus of the common logarithms and be
divided by the square of the velocity of light, and allowance made for
the microfarad being 10 ~15 of the absolute unit.

Passing now to the case of two equal parallel cylindrical conductors

TEST OF A BOILER BRACE.
JOHN T. FAIG.
In view of the facts that the proper staying of boilers is one of the
most important considerations in boiler design and that reports of tests
of braces are comparatively rare, the following may be of interest.
The brace tested was an iron brace of the well known crow-foot type
so much used in boiler design, and was made by the Montague Iron
Works, Montague, O. By reference to Fig. 1 it will be seen that it
differed from the usual form in the manner of its attachment to the
plate, being secured by studs instead of riveted directly to the head.
The advantage of this construction is the free circulation of water per-

mitted over the stayed surface. Fig. 1 is a drawing to scale made from
direct measurement before the test. In the specimen submitted for
testing, two crow-foot braces were connected by studs screwed through
the plate, in order to mount in the testing machine (see Fig. 2). When
actually applied in a boiler the studs are simply riveted over on the out-
side of the plate.
The brace having been secured in place, a slight initial pull was
given to insure close contact of the bearing surfaces of the pins. Two
light punch marks, one above and one below the braces, were made in
the solid bars, and their distance apart for each load measured by cali-
pers. The report of the test is given below.

During the earlier part of the test a measurement was made for
every 2,000 pounds added stress, then about every 4,000 pounds, and
finally, whenever the braces balanced the load fairly well. When the
stress in the braces had reached 35,800 pounds they were observed to
stretch rapidly; the stress was then reduced to 3,000 pounds, with a con-
traction of .05 inch. Fig. 2, from a photograph taken just before the
failure of the brace, shows the bending of the studs. Fig. 3, from a
photograph just after the failure, shows the rupture of the right hand
stud where it enters the lower brace. It is possible that the brace proper
would have stood a much larger stress, since the rupture occurred in the
fastening, although the pins were bent T8ff inch out of line. The test was
made on a 100,000 pound Olsen testing machine in the Engineering
Laboratory of the University of Michigan, under the direction of
Prof. M. E. Cooley. Figs. 2 and 3 are from photographs taken by
Mr. Emmons Collins. . .
THE METALLURGY OF THE REFRACTORY GOLD ORES OF
THE BLACK HILLS OF SOUTH DAKOTA.
FRANK CLEMES SMITH, '89.
The logical treatment of this subject necessarily exacts a preliminary
discussion of the character, occurrence and possibly the origin of the
ores in question; the scope of this article, however, will not permit of a
thorough consideration of this exceedingly interesting branch of the
subject, and, as it has been generally treated in a late article before the
American Institute of Mining Engineers, I will herein refer to it but
briefly.
The source of these ores lies entirely in the sedimentary rocks,
notably the Potsdam series of the Upper Cambrian and, to a less extent
so far as indicated by present explorations, the rocks of Carboniferous
age, which here comformably overlie the former, the rocks of the two
systems being generally the sole sedimentary representatives in the inner
uplift of the Black Hills. This limitation of the habitat of the refractory
ores of the region is in part due to local recognition of the conditions,
whereby most if not all of the pre-Cambrian ores are held to be of a
similar nature to those of the Homestake mine, from which a profit is
extracted by the process of free gold-milling although a very large part
of the total gold content, which is not susceptible to direct amalgama-
tion with mercury, is allowed to waste with the tailings. Whatever
criticism may be passed upon this local concept, it is true that the ores
to be described are very refractory, as will be discovered from their
description.
The ores of the Bald Mountain, Ruby Basin and other of the older
producing districts are found in the shales and sandstones of the Pots-
dam series, and consist of highly metamorphosed portions of these beds.

THE TECHNIC.
The range of the ore-deposits is always limited by that of certain igneous,
rocks (quartz-porphyry, rhyolite and phonolite) which occur in dikes,
surface flows (with reference to the present surface), and intercalated
sheets, and the origin of the ores is due to replacement of the soluble
cements of the sedimentary rocks by gelatinous silica carrying pyrite,
sylvanite, occasionally haloid silver minerals, torbernite, and other ura-
nium compounds, with small traces of copper; fluorite and calcite are
frequent associates, and gypsum is occasionally found. It is evident
that the mineralization is the result of secondary igneous action, since
everywhere in the Black Hills where the Potsdam rocks are exposed, in
districts showing no relatively late igneous phenomena, those rocks are
found to be barren of gold, and for the further reason that each one-
chute bears a close relation to an igneous dike which has been fractured
and shattered (probably by later igneous disturbances), and has thus
afforded a distributing channel for the upward flow of the mineralizing
solutions. The greater part of these ores, then, usually bear the appear-
ance of quartzites with many small druses filled with quartz, calcite and
fluorite; in the so-called "red" ores they are often highly colored with
oxide of iron, while the "blue" ores show un-oxidized pyrite. Both are
exceedingly tough and much more difficult to crush and pulverize than
quartz, and the average silica content is about 78 per cent.
The ores found in the Carboniferous limestones (which are magne-
sian) are of later discovery and have thus afforded less opportunity for
study. In general, they bear a close resemblance to those found in the
Potsdam rocks, though some have been found which are much lighter iu
color (looking like a piece of ordinary buff limestone) and which carry a
much higher per cent, of silica. Their origin is doubtless similar to that
of the other class, and their included minerals are similar, though all of
the ores seem to be oxidized.
The first discovery of these ores was made in 1877 by A J. Smith of
Portland, South Dakota, upon Green mountain, where ores were found
very near the surface carrying very considerable values in silver in addi-
tion to their gold. In 1879 this gentleman built an arrastra for the
treatment of these ores, but operated it for only about two months, since
the saving made was little or nothing. In 1880 the Portland Mining
Company (owning adjoining ground) built a mill for wet-crushing and
pan-amalgamation and, it is needless to say, made a failure, although
they claim to have saved about fifty per cent. of the silver and about
thirty per cent. of the gold. At about the same time, or a little later,
further attempts were made by the above company at the treatment of
their ores, kilns were erected for the purpose of roasting or drying cer-
tain of the ores which carried clay, and many other expensive contri-
vances were introduced, all of which failed to accomplish any adequate
saving of the values in silver and gold, and the project was abandoned
and the mill closed. While it is true that the ores milled by the above
company came from near the surface and frequently showed the usual
surface-minerals of silver which were, at that time, well known to be


105
susceptible to certain forms of amalgamation, it is nevertheless singular
that one failure should not have immediately suggested the advisability
of a very complete and accurate chemical analysis of the ores. Had this
been obtained it seems almost certain that the problem of the proper
metallurgical treatment would have been immediately solved. Having
discovered by analysis that the gold at least was associated with tellur-
ium, the attempts at amalgamation would have been immediately aban-
doned and an adequate process sought. At that time the process of
cyanide lixiviation was but little known, although it seems to have even
then been a patented process; this condition would cause the metallur-
gist to seek relief in smelting, since, for ores whose value was then con-
sidered to be largely made up of silver, chlorination (as a process by
which no silver could be saved) would be unavailing. The result of this
consideration would have been the temporary abandonment of the
attempt to treat these ores, since smelting, at that time, meant a neces-
sity for supplies of lead, something which could not be obtained. It may
be suggested that one alternative has been overlooked,—that of shipping
the ore; this, however, would have been impossible, since there were no
railroads in the country and freight rates were very high.
In the above case, exploration would have shown that the ores in
general were not silver ores, although, as stated, those near the surface
were such; aside from the immediate vicinity of the Portland ground
a relatively small proportion of the ores carry sufficient silver to unfit
them for chlorination.
In 1883 the Welcome Mining Company, whose property is located at
the head of Fantail gulch, built a mill for the treatment of the siliceous
ores from their mines. These ores differed considerably in the relative
proportions of the silver and gold from those of the Portland mines; an
average of 25 samples from the Welcome mines (now the property of
the Horseshoe Mining Company) gives nearly one-half ounce of gold for
each ounce of silver. In this mill two ball-pulverizers with plates for
amalgamation of the gold were placed; the rock milled was so tough as
to quickly affect the pulverizers and no gold was saved on the plates.
Next, a new form of pulverizer was used, with pans and settlers; ten
tons were treated, the pulverizer disabled, and no gold saved. Finally,
rock-breakers were put in, to operate with the pans; no saving being
made, the mill was shut down.
In 1886 the Buxton Mining Company built a stamp-mill in the same
vicinity; here was made the attempt to treat the siliceous ores by bro-
mi nation, and it is highly probable that, had there not been too much
hurry in the experiment and had general facilities been more nearly
equal to those of to-day, the experiment would have been successful,
for the extraction then made is said to have reached 75% of the gold.
These expensive failures, and several others of less importance,
operated to give the Potsdam ores a very bad name; for more than ten
years from the time of their discovery, only such ores as would yield
over |35.00 per ton would pay expenses for mining and shipment out of


THE TECHNIC.
the country, and none of the ores could be locally treated. In 1889 the
first successful plant for the treatment of these ores was erected at
Deadwood, by the Golden Reward Mining Company; it consisted of a
mill for treatment of 50 tons per day by barrel-chlorination, and has
been in constant operation since April, 1891, with a present capacity of
150 tons per day. In this mill the process is carried on as follows: The
ore is passed through rock-breakers, thence to a cylindrical drier, and
thence through flue crushers and crushing rolls where it is crushed to
8 or 12-mesh; this product, in the case of "red'' ores, is next roasted,
either in a Brown horseshoe reverberatory furnace or a Howell-White
continuous-discharge cylindrical furnace; the "blue" ores are roasted in
Bruckner cylindrical roasters, requiring a more complete roast than do
the red ores. After roasting, the fine ore is spread on cooling floors,
from which it is carried to bins and discharged through hoppers into the
chlorination barrels. These barrels (of which ttte Golden Reward mill
has five) are made of iron, lead-lined, fitted with an interior filter oppo-
site the charging-hole, and have a capacity of five tons each. About
four tons of ore are charged, along with about 12 pounds of bleaching-
powder and 20 pounds of sulphuric acid per ton; the barrels are slowly
revolved for about 1£ hours and, after chlorination is complete, water is
admitted under pressure, washing the ore through the interior filter;
the filtrate, containing the gold, is collected in a tank, and the tailings
washed out of the barrel and thrown away. In some cases the chlorine
in the filtrate is first reduced with sulphurous acid; otherwise, the solu-
tion is treated directly with hypo-sulphuric acid gas, thus causing the
precipitation of the gold along with various other metals. After par-
tial settling the solution is filtered through filter presses, the fallen
precipitate being collected at once or allowed to accumulate; all of the
sulphides are united, placed in sheet-iron pans, and roasted in large
muffles, afterward to be melted in graphite pots to bullion.
In considering this process with reference to its application to the
Potsdam ores and with regard to its arrangement at the mill just
referred to, several weak points are noticeable; no silver is saved, some
gold is lost in the tailings, and both gold and silver are lost during the
progress of the operation of ore-treatment from the influence of tellu-
rium. The average ore treated may be roughly considered to carry
about one ounce of gold and two ounces of silver per ton, and a moder-
ate estimate of the assay value of the tailings from this ore would give
10% of the gold and all of the silver, or a loss of about 16%. Add to
this the sum of the losses in roasting the ore, roasting the precipitated
sulphides and smelting to bullion, and the total loss will not be far from
25%. It should be stated that the company reserve, in their mines, all
ores carrying over three ounces of silver per ton, but seem to think they
can afford to throw away anything less than that amount. As the
silver is doubtless left in the tailings as chloride, it would seem that it
could be removed by some one of the many solvents, such as hypo-sul-
phite; what experiments the company have made in this direction I am


107
unable to state. One great source of loss in this process arises from
incomplete crushing, and this branch of the question is one of some
nicety. Experiments prove conclusively that fine crushing causes a
much better yield or extraction, both by the chlorination process and by
the process of cyanide lixiviation, but, especially in the case of ores of
such great toughness, additional crushing would surely add to the cost
of treatment; again, the finer the ore the more difficult and slow
becomes the filtration, again increasing the expense. From these con-
siderations it will be seen that the loss of precious metal in the tailings
(stated as approximating 16%) may be a reasonable loss so far as it is a
function of the fineness of crushing; but that question is only to be
settled by careful experiment upon a working scale. As the cost of
crushing is dependent upon (1) the wear upon machinery and (2) the cost
of power, it may be possible to reach a solution of the problem by an
analysis of the forces at work, confining our attention to the material
after it leaves the fine crushers or during its connection with the crush-
ing-rolls. These rolls revolve at high speed—from two to three revolu-
tions per second; the wear upon the rolls is due to the abrasive action of
the ore particles, and this abrasive action would be lessened if the duty
of the single machine were lowered and its burden diminished, not
necessarily by decreasing the amount of ore put through, but by deliv-
ering to each machine a more carefully sized product which should come
more nearly within its scope. For the same output this would necessi-
tate more rolls, and the increase in their number might be supposed to
exact more power; but as the power required varies directly with the
resistance to crushing of the ore-grains (the rolls themselves requiring
very little power) and as several factors tend to diminish the ultimate
resistance in the case of a more carefully sized ore-burden (notably, a
better abrasive action between ore-grains) it is probable that the power
need not be materially increased, if at all. To sum up: we should be
able to obtain a homogeneous 30 to 40-mesh product (for the coarsest)
from which the extraction would be much better than from an 8 to 12-
mesh product, at an increased cost of only the interest upon the invest-
ment in added machinery. The consideration of the matter of filtration
with a fine product leads to about the same conclusion, viz: that the
increase in expense would be a function of the interest upon the invest-
ment in more machinery. To offset the increased expense in the matter
of fine crushing and filtration of the finer product we have the increased
extraction and (with regard to chlorination) an interesting possibility of
avoidance of preliminary roasting—at least with red ores.
The losses in the chlorination process as applied to the ores in ques-
tion, to the extent that they may be traceable to the presence of tellu-
rium, have been elsewhere discussed;* showing the probable losses in
the initial roasting of the ore-pulp, in the roasting of the precipitated
sulphides, and finally in melting the last named product to bullion.

THE TECHNIC.
Definite information as to the extent of these losses I have been unable
to obtain, and have naturally hesitated to ask for.
In 1890 the Deadwood &amp; Delaware Smelting Company built a
small experimental smelting plant in Deadwood; to-day this plant
consists of five water-jacketed blast-furnaces and two reverberatory
furnaces, and constitutes in various ways the most important and
interesting metallurgical plant in the Black Hills. The process,
as developed after long experiment by Dr. F. H. Carpenter, is one
of matte concentration whereby the furnace burden consists of the
refractory ores, limestone, pyrite, copper ores and coke; three blast
furnaces handle daily 520 tons of this ore and flux material, using there-
with from 10 to 13% of Eastern coke or from 14 to 16% of Newcastle
coke, producing slags which carry about 52% of silica, a trace only of
copper, 0.2 to 0.4 ounces of silver per ton and from 10 to 20 cents per
ton in gold, with a matte representing about 5% by weight of the orig-
inal ore-charge. It will be noticed that the production of such highly
siliceous slags with such a relatively small consumption of fuel indicates
the advantageous utilization of the combustion of sulphur. This plant
constitutes the only local market for the siliceous ores in the Black
Hills, and in that respect is of great local importance. The pyritic ores
used are obtained from the Homestake mine at Lead City in the form of
concentrates which are treated for one-half of their assay value; they
are slag-roasted in the reverberatory furnaces and concentrated to about
one-third; afterwards being fed into the blast-furnace.
In 1892 a small plant for the treatment of the refractory ores by
cyanide lixiviation was erected in Deadwood, but has not been in con-
tinuous operation. It has a capacity of about 50 tons per day. the ores
treated consist of the red or oxidized variety, and they are not roasted
as in the chlorination process, but are crushed much finer. The results
obtained .by this process are yet somewhat doubtful, but inasmuch as
both silver and gold are amenable to it, we may look for its notable
extension in the future. The details of the process, as practiced in the
Deadwood mill, do not differ materially from those so widely described.
In November, 1895, the Kildonan Milling Company started their
chlorination plant at Pluma, a short distance from Deadwood. with an
initial capacity of 75 tons of refractory ores per day. It has since been
operating continuously, and has doubled its capacity. Its method of
treatment does not differ from that of the Golden Reward.
In the consideration of the metallurgy of the refractory gold ores
of the Black Hills, it is evident that great progress has been made
therein; progress which will compare favorably with that of other min-
ing districts whose early history has been one of persistent attempts in
the face of great disadvantages; yet it is no less evident that, in some
respects, the greatest efficiency has not yet been reached. Matte-smelt-
ing, as compared with lixiviation processes, requires a large consumption
of fuel (something which is not produced in the Black Hills), and also a
constant import of fluxing ores, while the latter processes treat the


109
local ores alone, with no necessity for fluxes aside from chemicals, with
a relatively small consumption of fuel, hut require an exceedingly fine
crushing of the ores and do not make the saving of the smelting pro-
cess. To this may he added the fact that the smelter pays freight on
matte to a market, while the lixiviation mills only pay for shipments
of gold bullion. These conditions would indicate that the solution of
the problem lies in the possibility of improvements in the wet processes,
and here lies a valuable and interesting field for the metallurgist.
CHIMNEY CAPACITY.
M. E. COOLEY.
The volume of gases passing through a chimney is practically the
same as the volume of air entering the furnace, the temperatures being
consideied the same. The weight of coal burned is added to the weight
of air entering the furnace, thereby increasing the
weight or density of the gases passing through the
chimney. This increase of weight may, however, be
neglected in practice and the problem treated as for
air aloue.*
Assume a chimney of unit area, and let t0&lt; v0 and
Wo represent absolute temperature, entering velocity
(volume), and weight of unit volume of external air;
let r, v and w represent the absolute temperature,
exit velocity I volume) and weight of unit volume of
chimney gases.
t =. 461 + i\ where T is the temperature shown by
a thermometer or pyrometer.
In the figure let the solid lines represent a chimney
of height H. The column of hot gases filling the
chimney will be balanced by a column of external air
of height W having the same weight, then H — h' is
the head producing velocity of flow of air into the fur-
_ nace. The velocity of flow of hot gases from the chim-
ney will be represented by a head h bearing a definite
relation to H — h'.
As the volume of a gas at constant pressure varies with its abso-
lute temperature, the weight of unit volume varies inversely as its abso-
lute temperature. We then have the following relations:

are instructive, and lead to the following which gives the weight of air

chimney section 100 feet high will burn 118.8 lbs. of coal per hour.
It is good engineering practice in building chimneys to provide for
an increase of power in the future, even though such increase be not

thought necessary at the time. A safe rule, therefore, is to allow 100
lbs. of coal for each square foot of chimney 100 feet high. The quanti-
ties burned with other heights will then be simply the square root of
the height multiplied by 10. For example, a chimney 81 feet high will
burn 10 V81 = 90 lbs. per square foot, and a chimney 225 feet high will
will burn 10 V225 = 150 lbs per square foot.
A chimney 80 to 100 feet high will burn the better grades of coal,
while 150 feet will be required for the inferior grades and for slack coals.
It is not necessary to use much greater heights in connection with
steam boilers.
A boiler horse power equals 30 lbs. of steam evaporated at 70 pounds
pressure from feed at 100° F. This is equal to from 4 to 5 lbs. of coal.
The horse-power of a chimney may then be expressed as follows, letting

RESULTS OF EXPERIMENTS BY PROF. M. F. GUTERMUTH
ON THE USE OF SUPERHEATED STEAM.
J. R. ALLEN, '92.
The results given in this article are from a paper by Prof. M. F.
Gutermuth, of Darmstadt, Germany. It was not possible to give a com-
plete translation, but I have attempted to present some of the most
interesting results obtained from his experiments.
The experiments were made with the Smith Superheater manufac-
tured by the Dingier Machine Co., in Zweibriicken, Germany. Experi-
ments were made on a 15-horse power stationary high speed engine, a
60-horse power compound engine and a 100-horse power compound engine.
Only the results of the experiments on the 15- and 100-horse power engines
are given here.
Fifteen-Horse Power High Speed Engine. — This engine was a
double acting high speed making 250 revolutions per minute, with a diam-
eter of 9.84 and a stroke of 6.39 inches; the regulation of the engine was
effected by a Doerfel-Proell's Shaft Governor.
The superheated steam was delivered by one tubular boiler having
150.69 sq. ft. of heating surface and 139.9 sq. ft. of superheating surface
without the Smith Superheater. The grate area was 7.1 sq. ft. The
boiler was arranged so that it could be used either with or without the
superheater.
Two eight hour tests were made, one with and one without the
superheater. The results of these tests are given in Table I.
These results show that the steam and coal consumption with
superheated steam were more than 50 per cent, less than with saturated


THE TECHNIC.
steam. The coal consumption for the test, working with saturated
steam, is greater than under ordinary circumstances, as the boiler was
not adapted to working under these conditions, its heating surface being
too small.
The indicator diagram for saturated steam, when compared with
the indicator diagram for superheated steam taken under similar condi-
tions, shows a greater reduction in pressure for the admission line of sat-
urated steam, and that the expansion curve for superheated steam falls
much more rapidly than for saturated steam.
One Hundred-Horse Power Compound Engine.—This engine had
two single acting horizontal high pressure cylinders working on two
cranks placed 180 degrees apart, and one double acting vertical low pres-
sure cylinder with the connecting rod fastened to one of the high pres-
sure cranks. The engine was operated condensing, the condenser being
direct driven.

The high pressure cylinders were operated by piston valves con-
trolled by an automatic shaft governor. The low pressure cylinder was
operated by a trick valve.
Steam was supplied to the engine by two vertical boilers of the Lan-
cashire type fitted with Smith superheaters. The superheater consisted
of coils of pipe through which the steam leaving the boiler was made
to pass, and situated in an extension of the breeching. The feed water
was also heated by a similar set of coils in the breeching. The exhaust
gases from the boiler were made to circulate aound these coils before
passing to the chimney.
The steam after exhausting from the high pressure cylinder and
before entering the low pressure cylinder was again superheated by
passing through another set of coils similarly situated in the exhaust
gases from the boiler. The results of these experiments are given in
Table II.
Test number one gives the results of the test made under the con-
ditions speciiied in the contract for the engine; test number two was
made with the same steam pressure but with more highly superheated


lit
receiver steam; test number three was made with a lower boiler pres-
sure than in the previous tests, and with the low pressure cylinder
unjacketed; test number four was made with the same pressure as in
test number three, but with the low pressure cylinder jacketed.

These experiments show that by increasing the superheating of the
receiver steam, an added economy in steam consumption is obtained.
A comparison of the actual expansion curve from the combined
diagram with the saturated steam curve shows that the steam remains
superheated to the end of the high pressure stroke. In the low pressure
cylinder, however, the steam is no longer superheated, in spite of the
steam entering the receiver being superheated 108°. This change of
steam condition is caused by the giving up of heat to the receiver steam,
which has become cooled by radiation and conduction, and by the influ-
ence of the cylinder walls.
In test number two, in which the receiver steam was superheated
almost 200° Fahrenheit, between the two cylinders, there is still initial
condensation on entering the low pressure cylinder.
It appears from the foregoing that in engines using superheated
steam, the steam conditions in the low pressure cylinder do not differ
materially from those of the ordinary compound engine with jacketed
cylinders.
The results obtained from these experiments seem to show a marked
economy in steam consumption by the use of superheated steam, espe-
cially if the superheating is carried far enough to prevent initial con-
densation in the high pressure cylinder. In view of this increased econ-
omy a number of commercial plants have been erected in Europe which
use superheated steam.

In presenting the '97 Technic to the members of the Engineering
Society, the Board of Editors feel justified in priding themselves upon
its early publication. For th,e first time in its history The Technic
makes its appearance on the first of June, this being largely due to a
very commendable promptness on the part of contributors. In its
make-up, a few minor changes will be noticed, perhaps the most promi-
nent of these being a new cover. It was thought best to follow the
example of last year's Board in omitting the once customary biography,
and the old familiar title page has also been omitted. A complete index
of all articles that have appeared in previous volumes has been com-
piled, and should meet with approval.

At last! the constitution and by-laws of the Engineering Society
have been published, and a neatly printed copy may be obtained by any
member of the Engineering Department. This has brought the Society
more prominently before the younger students, and has aided materially
in the success of the year's work.
The Society is indebted to L. L. Wheeler, '74, for a folio of drawings,
maps, and photographs of the Illinois and Mississippi River Canal; also
to C. T. Johnson, '95, for blue prints and photographs of irrigation
work in Wyoming.

The annual Banquet of the Society assumed a new form this year—
that of an alumni reunion. In response to invitations sent out by the
banquet committee a number of alumni attended, and their presence
added greatly to the pleasure of the occasion. It is a good thing for
both alumni and undergraduates thus to come together, and we trust
that the annual reunion may become a fixture.
The department is now blessed with musical organizations of its
own, the "Department of Technology Glee and Mandolin Clubs " having
sprung into existence during the past year. The excellent work of these
clubs has added greatly to the enjoyment of many a social gathering,
and it is the hope of every Engineer that they may long live and pros-
per. "Hurrah for the Engineers!"


We are pleased to announce that the Electrical Engineering Lab-
oratory has received an entirely new equipment for work in alternating
currents. The Fort Wayne Electric Corporation, of Fort Wayne, Ind.,
whose advertisement appears in our columns, have been so kind as to
substitute for their old alternator a new 33 K. W. " Wood" alternator,
exciter, and complete switchboard apparatus, all being of the very latest
and most improved type. This is a very valuable addition to the labora-
tory equipment, and will be greatly appreciated by students in electrical
engineering.

We wish to thank our contributors for their assistance in making
The Technic, and our advertisers for making The Technic possible.
Engineers, when in need of supplies, consult the advertising col-
umns of The Technic. You will find ouly the best advertised there.

MOTION
The above cut represents the 150 K. W. plant of the Chicago Board of Trade,
consisting of Ames Compound Engines and Westinghouse Gen-
erators, S~5 B. P. M.
When running under normal conditions, each engine drives its adjacent gener-
ator directly connected without revolving the interior auxiliary t^haft.
But in case of accident to any engine or generator, which would prevent normal
operation, either or both generators are available from either engine, thus securing the
flexibility and reliability of a "belted" plant, and at the same time retaining all the
advantages of the " direct connected " plan. The result is a plant which
Will Cost Less to Install,
Will be More Reliable in Operation,
and Will take Less Floor Spice
than with any other arrangement. Any standard type of engine or generator can be
□Bed. Old plants can be rebuilt.
1 his Company is Prepared to take Contracts
for power plants complete, and after leurning lo&lt;al conditions, will guarantee to deliver a
kilo-watt hour on the switch-board for a specified cost. Write for Information.

ELECTRIC LIGHTING PLANT.
HENRY S. CARHART.
The electric lighting and power plant of the University of Mich-
igan presents several features of interest which justify a brief descrip-
tion. The major part of it has been in operation since the middle of
November; the auxiliary plant at the University hospitals has, how-
ever, only just been completed.
The main plant is on the campus in a wing of the boiler house
from which sixteen buildings are heated. It consists of two 15 x 14
McEwen engines connected by means of the Arnold system to two 75
KW Thompson-Ryan dynamos. By the Arnold system either dynamo
or both of them may be run from either engine. One of the advan-
tages of this arrangement is that the dynamos can be tested by
purely electrical methods, since they can very readily be disconnected
from the engines.
In the nineteen buildings on the campus lighted by this plant are
4,000 incandescent lamps and 23 enclosed arcs. There are nine more
of the latter on the grounds. The observatory and the hospitals have
600 more incandescents. Another large building is under construc-
tion, and this will bring the total number of incandescent lamps up
to 5,000.


THE TECHNIC.
The system is two-wire 220 volt direct. It was adopted after
mature deliberation in spite of the lower efficiency of the 220 as com-
pared with the 110 volt lamp. The two prevailing reasons were the
great distance of some of the buildings from the power house and the
desirability of employing the same generators for power and light-
ing. The steam for heating the buildings is carried through a brick
tunnel 5' 6" by 6' 6'', extending from the power house round near or
under all the buildings and back to the power house again, a distance
of 2.800 feet. The largest buildings are at the greatest distance.
The lighting mains had to be carried through this same tunnel.
Hence the cost of the copper for a 110 volt system was almost prohi-
bitive. It was also desirable to replace several small steam engines
by electric motors in order to secure centralization of power. Other
motors were needed at a considerable distance from the station. To
these considerations must be added the fact that the observatory and
the hospitals are nearly three-quarters of a mile from the power
house, and economy dictates that these should be lighted from the
main plant. It is much easier to do this with 220 volts than with 110.
To secure uniform pressure throughout the distribution on the
campus the following plan was adopted. A pair of No. 000 mains were
carried entirely around through the tunnel, forming two complete
circles. To four points of these, as centres of the heaviest loads, are
connected four pairs of feeders. Each pair runs directly from the
bus bars through a switch on the switch board. The positive and
negative cables are supported on opposite sides of the tunnel between
special porcelain knobs. No greater difference of pressure than two
volts has ever been observed at the ends of these feeders. Service
wires run through fused switches directly from the mains to the
several buildings. Buildings not located over the tunnel are reached
by braided caoutchouc cables drawn into galvanized iron pipes. There
is no insulation in the pipes. A few of the service cables are from 150
to 200 feet long. Thus far not the slightest trouble has been expe-
rienced, and not a single fuse has gone in the tunnel, either on feed-
ers or service wires.
The buildings are all wired on the closet system. The closets
have slate backs and are lined with heavy asbestos board. The fuses
are all of extra length. No porcelain fuse blocks are used at these
centres, and there are no fuses in the fixtures, except in porcelain
rosettes and extension attachments. Single pole switches and the
best grade of General Electric sockets are used throughout. Special
precautions have been taken to secure safety by the use of nothing
but the best insulation, abundance of flexible tubing, and lamp cord
with double rubber insulation.
Current is carried to the hospitals by means of No. 000 cables a
distance of .'i,800 feet. To compensate for the drop in potential a
series wound "booster," designed to raise the potential 50 volts at
full load, is included in the circuit. The motor and generator of the


3
set are directly connected together on the same base. They were
made to order by the Excelsior Electric Co. After 10:30 at night only
a small current is needed on the campus, while light must be avail-
able all night at the hospitals. Hence a 25 KW Westinghouse gener-
ator, directly connected to a Russell 9 x 12 engine, has been installed
in the boiler house at the hospitals. It runs at 300 R. P. M., the larger
engines running at 250. After shutting down the main plant at night,
the smaller one supplies the lights at the hospitals, as well as the
small current needed on the campus. The small generator serves also
as a reserve and as a safeguard in case of accident at the main plant
or on the lines. The two power houses are connected by a private
telephone line. Pressure wires also are carried back from the hospi-
tals to the campus switchboard.
The switchboards are of marble supported on wrought iron
frames. They are provided with Weston instruments, round pattern
and set flush with the marble. Each generator is protected by a
Cutter automatic circuit breaker. There are no fuses on the boards.
The large one, consisting of three panels, was made by the Western
Electric Co. after plans and specifications furnished them; the small
one, by Bissell &amp; Co., Toledo. All the switches on both were made by
the Western Electric Co.
Another interesting feature is that all the engines exhaust
directly into the large -pipes of the heating system. Hence single
expansion non-condensing engines are used. The back pressure runs
from one to five pounds. Great economy is secured by this arrange-
ment and it works to entire satisfaction.
Edison 220 volt lamps are employed throughout. Most of them
are 4 watt lamps: the last lot received are 3* watt made to order.
The test on them is now in progress, and the present indications are
that they will be adopted. Occasionally a lamp short circuits when
its fibre fails. The only result is the blowing of a fuse at the centre,
but this is readily replaced. It occurs only rarely. Some of these
4 watt lamps have burned for five months continuously, except Sun-
days, and ten hours a day. They are not blackened, and to the eye
do not appear to have appreciably deteriorated. In other words,
they have already lived twice the allotted life of a good and useful
incandescent lamp.
Thus far the day load is rather small, though ten motors ranging
from 1 to 50 HP are in daily use. More are to be added. These run
lathes, mammoth organ bellows, fans for ventilation, requiring from
2 to 10 HP each, a saw and a planer in the carpenter shop, and the
dynamos in the laboratory of Electrical Engineering. For this latter
purpose a 2i and a 50 HP motor are employed. They are supplied
with current by special cables running directly from the bus bars at
the switchboard.
The plant is running without a hitch of any kind and the indica-
tions thus far are entirely favorable to a 220 volt system for such an


THE TECHNIC.
installation. It was designed by the Engineering Department of the
University, and the work of installing it and of wiring the buildings
has been done by students and recent graduates of the same depart-
ment.
PLANE TABLE*
J. B. DAVIS, '68.
46. Under Side of Rule.—This should be a plane. In case of
injury, the rule should be returned to the maker, to be tested; refitted,
if necessary; and its bottom resurfaced, if found imperfect. The
surface of the bottom of the rule is a vital part of the plane table,—
quite as much so as either the spindle, or telescope axis. It should be
cared for even more carefully than other parts as it is more exposed
to injury. It may be injured by a fall; by crowding into a box the
alidade does not quite fit; or by not being well packed in the box. If
poorly packed it win be in danger during transportation. The rule
may be bent, twisted, double bent, or both double bent and twisted.
With some kinds of packing, the last injury is to be expected. Rules
that are very light, or of open work, are especially liable to injury.
The bottom of the rule should be continuous, like a plate. The pack-
ing of the alidade should be as perfect, and as secure, as can be
devised. The metal for the rule, while such as does not disturb the
magnetic needle, should be very stiff, and afterwards as light as can
be. The rule may be ribbed above to make it lighter. It should be
wide to give steadiness to the telescope axis, notwithstanding the
increase in weight and that it will cover up more of the board.
Rules are commonly too narrow; the telescope unsteady, sidewise;
and the pointings untrustworthy. The same balance of precision
running through the various parts of a plane table should be required,
as is expected in a field transit.
47. Edge of Rule.—The edge of the rule should be straight. The
metal rules, as received from instrument makers, are intended to be
so. The person using a plane table, new to him, should test the edge
of the rule as directed below, to assure himself that it is straight, or
to find out if it has been injured. Ordinarily a rule with an imperfect
edge should be returned to the maker to be put in shape. If the user
cannot command the services of an instrument maker, in case of a
crooked, or damaged, rule, something may be done to improve it, as
mentioned below.
To test the straightDess of the edge of the rule, place the alidade
on a piece of paper,—drawing paper, if practicable,—stretched upon
a plane surface. Draw a line, closely following the edge of the rule,
♦Continued from The Technic, 1897, page 36.


5
with a sharp thin pointed knife, cutting a slight mark in the surface
of the paper. Mark the ends of the rule,—a pencil mark will do.
Take up the alidade. Place the rule on the opposite side of the knife
line. Bring the ends of the rule to the same places on the line as
before, and set the edge of the rule at the ends precisely to the knife
mark on the paper. Use a magnifying glass for this. Draw a second
line with the knife, as before. Remove the alidade. See if the
marks coincide. If they do not their deviations will locate the
imperfections in the edge of the rule. If they do coincide the rule
is near enough straight for use on the plane table.
If it needs it, the rule may be carefully ground on a water grind-
stone; or rubbed down with emery on a piece of soft wood; or scraped
with the back of a knife ground to a square corner. By carefully
working with it, it may be restored to a condition fit to use. This
may cause much less delay and expense, than stopping the work
would, to send the rule to some distant maker.
As noted in 10, both edges of the rule ought to be straight and
parallel.
48. Surface of Board.—This should be a plane. Apply a straight
edge,—the rule, oft from the alidade possibly,—to the surface of the
board in many directions,—from the center outward, and across these
lines. The straight edge should fit the surface of the board, every-
where. If it does not, work the surface of the board down with a
plane, a scraper, and sand-paper, till the straight edge will fit, as
above noted.
49. Levels on the Rule.—These levels are adjusted with respect
to the under surface of the rule, for the purpose of having this under
surface of the rule stand level when their bubbles read level.
Put a paper on the board. Set up the table firmly. Level it as
directed in 5. Leave the alidade centrally on the board over a pair
of levelling screws. Clamp the spindle. Draw a line by the edge of
the rule. Mark the places of the ends of the rule. Carefully set the
levelling screws so both bubbles will stand level. If they can be set
so both will read, and stand level, it will be an assurance that the
table is steady.
Take up the alidade, carefully. Reverse it. Replace it, reversed,
on the opposite side of the line and at the same place thereon. See
if the bubbles read level. Take up the alidade. Reverse it. Place
it back in its first position. See if the bubbles read level again.
Repeat these trials, making the necessary corrections in the setting,
or levelling, of the plane table, till the bubbles will surely read level
again when the alidade is returned to its first position. Then reverse
the alidade, as at first, and note the deviations of the bubbles from a
level reading.
Correct, by estimation, one-half the deviation of a bubble by
means of the screws that fasten the level tube to the rule.
Level again carefully. Test the adjustment as at first. Repeat


THE TECHNIC.
the corrections and tests, in this manner, till no deviation appears
when the test is made.
Check screws upon the adjusting screws of the level tubes (some-
times placed in the end plugs of the level tubes) must be released
before making the correction. These check screws keep the level
tubes longer in adjustment, but may give annoyance in making the
adjustment. Do not screw them too tight. Test the adjustment, and
see that it is correct, after the check screws are set.
50. Board at Right Angles to Spindle.—This is for the purpose of
having the surface of the board remain level during its revolution on
the spindle. This is necessary in orienting the plane table, or in any
case requiring the table to be turned about its spindle. The top sur-
face of the board is set square to the spindle.
The board should have a true top surface. The level tubes on the
rule should be in adjustment.
If the board is much out of square with its spindle, it may be
shown by setting up the table where the board can be revolved on its
spindle so its surface is just touched, near its outer edge, by a pencil
point, or a pointed stick. The board should be connected to its fas-
tenings so this mechanical test will show it to be. square to the
spindle.
Set up the plane table firmly. Level it carefully with the spindle
undamped, and the alidade standing over a pair of levelling screws.
Reverse the board on its spindle. See if the bubbles read level.
Reverse the board back to its first position. See if the bubbles again
read level. Repeat these trials, making the necessary corrections in
the setting, or levelling, of the plane table, till the bubbles will surely
read level again when the board is returned to its first position.
Then reverse the board, as at first, and note the deviations of the
bubbles from level readings.
Change the bearings of the connections beneath the board so as
to correct one-half the apparent level error. Sometimes the board
is connected with the tripod head by means of a brass plate screwed
centrally to its under side,—sometimes by three radial brass arms,
connected centrally to the board by screws at their ends. Whatever
the plan, the bearings of these connections should be changed by
working down the wood slightly, or inserting very thin washers of
paper, or some similar device for making this change. The board
will need to be taken off the tripod head to do this.
Level the plane table carefully again. Test the adjustment as at
first. Repeat the corrections and tests, in this manner, till the bub-
bles will stand level during an entire revolution of the board on its
spindle.
51. The preceding adjustments can better be made under cover
wherever there is a firm footing for the plane table, as in a well
lighted basement or cellar.

52. Line of Sight at Right Angles with Telescope Axis.—This is for
the purpose of having the line of sight move in a plane when the
telescope is rotated on its axis. There are two cases. First, when
the telescope can be reversed on its axis. Second, when it cannot.
In the second case the wyes in which the ends of the telescope axis
rest are made so as to be opened, the telescope lifted out, turned over,
and replaced with axis reversed. In the plane table the trunions are
taken to be of equal size. There are no examinations made for
equality of size, and roundness, of trunions, as might be required in a
fine transit. This adjustment is much more easily made when the
wyes are open. This is a reason for making the wyes open in this
instrument. Usually the telescope axis in open wye alidades is made
much too short for the precision of the telescope itself. By making
this axis longer, using open wyes, and supplying a striding level to fit
the trunions, this adjustment, and the adjustment of this axis parallel
to the under side of the rule, would be made easy.
53. Line of Sight at Right Angles With Telescope Axis. Closed
Wyes.—Ajilace to set the plane table in is needed where well defined
marks can be readily found on opposite sides of it at as great a dis-
tance away as the telescope will show them clearly, so the pointings to
them can be made with precision. The marks had better be about on
a level with the plane table when set up, or at about the same
angle below on one side and above on the other, so the telescope will
be as nearly reversed as practicable, in sighting to them. Besides
these distant marks, one about half as far away is needed on one
side.
The objective slide should be in good line. The levels on the rule
should be in adjustment.
Set up the plane table firmly in a suitable place. Level it care-
fully. Place, or leave, the alidade central on the table. Look for
two marks, the first at some distance away, and the second much
farther off, that the line of sight can be made to strike at once.
Clamp the spindle. Set the line of sight on these marks. To do this,
use the hands to shift the alidade slightly on the board, and the
spindle slow motion screw to make the final pointing. See if the
levels still read level. If not, correct the setting of the levelling
screws, and the pointing of the telescope slightly, till the line of
sight strikes both marks and the bubbles both read level. Turn the
telescope about its axis and find a distant mark in apparent line, in
the opposite direction. Turn the telescope back again and see if the
line of sight strikes the first marks. Repeat these pointings, making
the necessary corrections in the setting and levelling of the plane
table till the line of sight will surely strike the first marks again
when the telescope is turned back.
Lift up the alidade. Change ends with it. Replace it on the
board in a reversed position. Turn the telescope to look at the first
two marks. Set the alidade with the hands, and by means of the


8
THE TECHNIC.
spindle slow motion screw, so the line of sight will strike the first two
marks. Should the board appear to be not quite level, level it.
.Finally set the alidade so that the line of sight strikes both the first
marks and the bubbles both read level. Reverse the telescope on its
axis and see if the third mark is in line. Turn the telescope back to
the first marks, as before, and, by the same means, make sure the line
of sight will strike those marks. Then reverse the telescope, as at
first, and note the deviation of the line of sight from the third
mark.
Correct, by estimation, one-fourth of the deviation of the vertical
cross wire by means of the screws at right angles with it that hold
the cross wires in the telescope tube. Whether the telescope shows
objects right side up, or not, turn these screws as if to increase the
apparent deviation. Loosen the screw permitting the desired move-
ment before turning the other. Leave the screws under a gentle,
even, strain. If the deviation is large, loosen the other pair of screws
slightly, but have a care not to get the vertical cross wire inclined.
Set the line of sight again upon the first two marks, as in the
beginning. Repeat the tests, corrections and tests, till no deviation
appears when the test is made.
54. Line of Sight at Right Angles With Telescope Axis. Open
Wyes.—A place to set the plane table in is needed where a well
defined fixed mark can be readily found at as great a distance away as
the telescope will show it distinctly, so pointings to it can be made
with precision. The mark should be about on a level with the table.
Set up the plane table firmly in a suitable place. Level it care-
fully. Place, or leave, the alidade central on the table. Open the
wye clips. Look for a distant, well defined, fixed mark. Direct the
telescope to look at the mark. Clamp the spindle. Set the line of
sight on the mark with the spindle slow motion screw. Lift the teles-
cope out of the wyes. Turn it over, keeping the objective towards
the mark. Replace it in the wyes with the telescope axis reversed,
the telescope the other side up, and looking to the mark. See if the
line of sight strikes the mark. Lift the telescope, and replace it in
its first position. See if the line of sight strikes the mark again.
Repeat these trials, making the necessary corrections in the setting
or levelling of the instrument until the line of sight will surely strike
the mark again when returned to its first position. Then reverse the
telescope as at first and leave it so as to show the deviation of the
line of sight from the mark.
Correct, by estimation, one-half the apparent deviation of the
vertical cross wire from the mark, by means of the screws at right
angles with it that hold the cross wires in the telescope tube.
Whether the telescope shows objects right side up, or not, turn these
screws as if to increase the apparent deviation. Loosen the screw
permitting the desired movement before turning the other. Leave
the screws under a gentle, even strain. If the deviation is large,


loosen the other pair of screws slightly, but have a care not to get
the vertical cross wire inclined.
Set the line of sight again upon the mark. Kepeat the tests, cor-
rections, and tests, till the line of sight will strike the mark when the
test is made.
55. Striding Level.—As noted in 52 a striding level may be useful.
It may be employed to improve the precision and trustworthiness of
the measurements of vertical angles, and facilitate the adjustment
of the telescope axis parallel to the under side of the rule. This
level itself should be kept in adjustment. The method of adjustment
is as follows.
Set up the plane table firmly. Level it carefully. Place, or leave,
the alidade central on the board. Clamp the spindle with the teles-
cope axis over a levelling screw. Place the striding level on the
telescope axis. See if it reads level. If not, change the setting of
the levelling screws till it will stand level. Lift off the striding level.
Reverse it. Replace it in reversed position. See if it reads level.
Return it to its first position. See if it reads level again. Repeat
these trials, making the necessary changes in the setting and levelling
of the instrument, till the bubble of the striding level will surely read
level again when returned to its first position. Then reverse the
striding level, as at first. Leave it so as to show the deviation of its
bubble from a level reading.
Correct, by estimation, one-half the deviation of the bubble from
a level reading by means of the adjusting screws which connect the
level tube of the striding level to its base.
Test the adjustment as before. Repeat the tests, corrections,
and tests, till the bubble will read level when the test is made.
In making this adjustment stand the striding level vertically over
the bearings. Do not incline it. If inclined it may show this adjust-
ment apparently imperfect. This requires a second adjustment side-
wise to bring the axis of the level tube into a plane parallel to the
line of the points of support of the feet of the striding level.
To adjust the striding level sidewise, first make the last adjust-
ment as perfect as practicable.
Incline the striding level slightly on its feet. Return it to its
first position. See if the bubble again reads level. Incline it in the
opposite direction about the same amount. Return it again to its
first position. See if the bubble again reads level. Repeat these trials,
making the necessary corrections in the setting or levelling of the
plane table, till the bubble will surely read level again when returned
to its first position, and stand at the same reading when inclined.
Then incline the striding level, as at first, and note the deviation of
the bubble from a level reading. Incline it a like amount in the oppo-
site direction and note the deviation.
By means of the screws for a sidewise adjustment set the level
tube so it will show the same deviation in the same direction for the


»
same inclination either way from its vertical stand, when tested as
above described.
The bubble should read level in all three positions. If it does not
the bore of the glass tube is not uniform, and it should be replaced by
a perfect one at the first opportunity. In using such a striding level
be very careful to stand it plumb on its feet.
This adjustment, and the preceding, need to be made alternately
together when first the bubble tube is attached to its base.
If, for any reason, the bubble tube has to be disconnected from its
base, loosen but one of the sidewise screws and notice how tight it is.
Likewise, if there is a check screw to the vertical adjustment, leave
it alone,—only unscrew the adjusting screw. When the bubble tube
is again restored to its connections with its base it can be set almost
in its proper place by bringing the loosened screws to their bearings
again, and not require so much adjustment.
56. Telescope Axis Parallel to Under Side of Rule.—This adjust-
ment is for the purpose of making the line of sight revolve in a plane
perpendicular to the under side of the rule. When the plane table is
set up and levelled, the line of sight will revolve in a vertical plane,
when it is at right angles to the telescope axis, and that axis parallel
to the under side of the rule. This adjustment places the line of the
telescope axis parallel to the under side of the rule.
The objective slide should be in good line. The levels on the rule
should be in adjustment. With closed wyes, the line of sight should
be in adjustment at right angles with the telescope axis.
57. With Closed Wyes, set up the table as near some high, well
defined, fixed, mark as it can stand and that mark be easily observed
with the telescope. Place the alidade central on the table, and level
it carefully. Set the line of sight on the high mark by means of the
spindle clamp and slow motion screw. Leave the spindle clamp
secure. See that the bubbles both read level. Correct the setting of
the levelling screws slightly, and the pointing also, if needed, till the
line of sight will strike the mark and the bubbles stand level. Turn
the objective downwards till the line of sight points at nearly the
same angle below the horizon that it did above. Find, or fix, two
marks, near by, in apparent line, ten or fifteen feet apart, with little
or no change in the pointing of the telescope. Make sure of the
stability of the table, alidade, and telescope by repeated pointings
upon the upper and lower marks, and by watching the levels. Make
any necessary changes in the setting or levelling of the table to
secure this.
Take up the alidade. Reverse it. Replace it on the table. Re-
verse the telescope. Level, if needed. Set the line of sight to range
upon the two lower marks, using the spindle clamp and slow motion
screw. Level, more carefully, if needed. Perfect the pointing on
the lower marks.
See if the upper mark is now in apparent line. Repeat the point-


II
ings and make sure of the stability of the telescope. Finally leave
the telescope pointing to the upper mark. Note the deviation of the
line of sight from the upper mark.
Correct, by estimation, one-fourth the apparent deviation, by
means of the device provided for controlling the inclination of the
telescope axis to the horizon.
Prepare for the test, and test the adjustment as at first. Repeat
the tests, corrections, and tests, till no deviation of the line of sight
from the upper mark appears, when the test is made.
58. With Open Wyes and a striding level to fit the telescope
axis: set up the table firmly: open the wye clips; place the alidade
central on the board; level the table carefully, using the striding
level to set the table more precisely level. Mark the position of the
alidade on the board. See that the striding level stands level. The
striding level must not be reversed in this work. Lift the striding
off. Take up the alidade. Reverse it. Replace it to its former place
on the board, but in a reversed position, taking the utmost care not
to disturb the table in any way. Replace the striding level,—do not
reverse it. See if it reads level. Lift it off. Take up the alidade.
Reverse it. Place it back in its first position. Set the striding level
on again,—do not reverse it. See if it now reads level. Repeat these
trials and reversions, making any necessary changes in the setting or
levelling of the table till the striding level will surely read level
again when the alidade is returned to its first position. Reverse the
alidade, again, as at first, and leave it so as to show the deviation of
the bubble of the striding level from a level reading.
Correct one-half the deviation by means of the device provided
for controlling the inclination of the telescope axis to the horizon.
Prepare for the test, and test the adjustment as at first. Repeat
the tests, corrections, and tests, till the bubble of the striding level
will surely read level when the test is made.
59. Adjusting the Telescope Axis Horizontally.—This adjustment,
in addition to the line of sight adjustment, and the previous telescope
axis adjustment, causes the plane in which the line of sight revolves,
to be parallel to the edge of the rule, as well as perpendicular to the
under side of the rule. Theoretically, this is not necessary. Surveys
would be correct if this plane made any fixed angle with the edge of
the rule, if it was perpendicular to the under side of the rule. It is
easier to find if it be parallel to the edge of the rule, than for some
other position.
The following adjustments should be correct at the time of
making this one: Level tubes on the rule, line of sight, telescope axis
parallel to under side of rule: and striding level if one is used.
Provide a firm, level, support for the alidade. Two stout square
topped stakes, properly driven, may answer. The support may be
made level by placing the alidade on it and correcting it till the
bubbles on the rule read level. The cross level is the more important


THE TECHNIC.
one, but both should stand level. If a striding level is used fix the
support so this will stand level when placed on the telescope axis.
The alidade should stand firm and steady on the support. Prom this
support the line of sight should strike a distant, well defined, fixed
mark. Have ready some needles, and a needle point. Put a paper on
the board.
Set up the table firmly about twenty feet from the alidade sup-
port, so the line from it to the distant mark will cross the board cen-
trally, and with one pair of levelling screws crosswise of this line.
Clamp the spindle securely. Level the table carefully. Place the
alidade on the prepared support. See that it stands level and steady
on the support, when the line of sight strikes the distant mark. Use
the hands to make the pointing on the mark. Locate two points in
line on the table with the needle point, and prick them down, a little
less than the length of the rule apart. Also locate a point (on a stake
perhaps) in line, forty or fifty feet beyond the table. Test these loca-
tions by repeated pointings to the distant mark,—also notice the
levels, and see that they remain level.
Transfer the alidade forward, as it stands, to the table, and bring
the edge of the rule to the points marked on the paper. Be especially
careful not to move the table in any way. See if the level bubbles on
the rule read level. If not, level the table again, and relocate all
three of the points, as at first. So continue to do until the level bub-
bles on the rule read level when the alidade is transferred forward to
the board and the edge of the rule brought to the prick marks on the
paper.
See if the line of sight strikes the distant and near by marks, or
at the same distance from and on the same side of them.
By means of the device provided for controlling the direction of
the telescope axis in a horizontal plane, set this axis so the line of
sight will strike the marks named, or pass the same distance from,
and on the same side of both, when the edge of the rule is at the prick
marks on the paper.
After the adjustment seems perfect return the alidade to the
support: with the hands make the line of sight strike both marks
beyond the table: and try the prick marks on the paper for line. If
they are no longer on line the table has been moved. Level the table
again if it needs it. Repeat the work. Continue these locations,
adjustments, and tests, till all four points are in line at the final test.
In making this adjustment the alidade maybe set over parallel to
the line of the two prick marks on the paper, by pricking off equal
distances from them, so that, after repeated trials, the line of sight
will strike both marks when the telescope axis is adjusted. The equal
distances must be very carefully pricked oft' to make sure they are
really precisely equal. This process saves any estimation of the dis-
tances between the line of sight and the two forward marks. The
distance finally found between the edge of the rule, when the line of


13
sight strikes both marks, and the original prick marks, shows the posi-
tion of the plane of revolution of the line of sight with reference to
the edge of the rule.
60. Telescope Level Tube.—Telescope level tubes are attached by
nuts permitting a vertical motion at each end of the level tube, and
without any sidewise adjustment, such as is commonly seen on the wye
level, and on the striding levels. This makes it important that these
level tubes be carefully set by the maker, and that the glass bubble
tube be placed, and fastened, in its brass case with every care. Strid-
ing levels are used, fitting on collars turned on the body tube of the
telescope. These may be adjusted in every particular. They are
very easily attached and detached, will not fall off, and can be used
on the telescope when it is either side up. The ability to completely
adjust them makes them more desirable than the old form, even if
provided with a double ground bubble tube, reading either side up,
which is protected by a loose brass shell outside the brass case of the
bubble tube. All such bubble tubes should be scaled directly on the
glass itself, not by a brass scale standing over it.
This adjustment is for the purpose of setting the level tube, or
the horizontal cross wire, so the bubble will, read level when the line
of sight is horizontal. With the level tube attached to the telescope
body tube, as first above noted, the level tube is adjusted and there is
no very good way of setting the horizontal cross wire in its best posi-
tion in the telescope. "With the striding level standing on collars
turned on the outside of the body tube, the cross wires are adjusted
and the horizontal wire brought to its best position in the telescope.
With the striding level no aid is required,—one can make the adjust-
ment alone.
To adjust the attached telescope level there are three principal
steps. First, levelling the plane table with the telescope level. Sec-
ond, setting the line of sight horizontal. Third, setting the level
tube and testing the adjustment. This method of levelling the plane
table is necessary or the delicate telescope level would be made to
depend upon the levels on the rule.
For levelling the plane table, set it up firmly. Level it carefully with
the rule levels. Set the telescope level tube to read level by means
of the clamp and slow motion screw to the telescope axis. Reverse
the table on its spindle. Notice the telescope level reading. Reverse
back. See if the telescope level reads level again. If not, set it to
read level again. Reverse the table again and notice the telescope
level reading. Continue these reversions, making the necessary cor-
rections in the setting of the table and the telescope level, till it will
certainly read level in the first position of the table, and return to
the same reading always when the table is reversed. Leave the table
reversed. Note the deviation of the bubble of the telescope level
from a level reading.


THE TECHNIC.
Correct one-half of this deviation by the slow motion screw to the
telescope axis.
Level and reverse the table again, as before.
Repeat these operations till the telescope level will read level in
either the first, or the reversed position, of the table.
Turn the table one-quarter round and level it again, as above
set forth.
By repeated trials, making the necessary corrections in the set-
ting of the table and the telescope level, as above directed, make this
level read level for any position of the table when turned on its
spindle.
For setting the line of sight level. Level the table as above directed.
Leave the telescope clamped. Measure oft, each way from the center
of the table, the same distance, say 150' or 200', and drive a stake till
firm, at the end of each measurement. Number these stakes 1 and 2.
See that the table is level and stands steady. Take accurate rod
readings on the tops of the stakes. Subtract the reading on 1 from the
reading on 2 and preserve the sign of the result, + or —. Call this
result k.
Move the table to a place, a short distance, say 30', beyond stake
1, carrying the telescope clamped as last used. Set up the table here
and level it as directed above. Take a rod reading, r,, on stake 1 and
another, n, on stake 2, just as the first ones were taken. Record
these with their numbers. Find r2 — r„ noting the sign. Call this
k'. See if k — k'. Make sure of the whole work.
If k = k' the line of sight is horizontal and the level tube in ad-
justment. If k' does not equal k, measure the distances from the
center of the table to stake 1, du and to stake 2, di. Find a rod read-
ing, Rj, for stake 2 by the following equation, observing all signs:
^ i- &lt;
R2 = r-2 -+ di ;i,
&lt;Z'2 — o\
Hold up the rod on stake 2 (set at this reading, R,, if a target
rod), and by means of the slow motion screw to the telescope axis, set
the line of sight so it will give the rod reading, R2. on stake 2.
Test by taking a new rod reading, R,, on 1. Find Ra — R,. observ-
ing the sign of the result. See if the result very nearly equals k.
Proceed with these trials and tests till the line of sight is set so
that R2 — R, at a test, equals k, or so near it that the experiments
show it to be useless to try further.
For setting the level tube. Set the level tube to read level by means
of the nuts at one end of it. Start that nut first that will permit the
desired movement. Leave the nuts under a gentle even strain.
Test the level tube adjustment by additional rod readings and
finally set it so that R; — R, = k when the bubble stands level.—or as
near this condition as can be.


15
If the ground is near enough level, drive the stakes so the first
rod readings on them will be equal. Then Tc = o. Proceed as above
directed after that, but use the equation below instead of (1). observ-
ing all signs.
R2 = n (2)
d2 — &lt;2,
With some experience in making this adjustment, probably the equa-
tions will be dispensed with.
Double ground level tube. Adjust as directed above, using but one
side. Release the necessary clamps: reverse the telescope about its
axis and the table on its spindle; and set the line of sight horizontal
by means of the rod readings on stakes 1 and 2. See if the bubble of
the telescope level reads level. Repeat the observations and rod
readings till sure the line of sight is level, the table steady, and the
bubble gives the same reading. Note the deviation of the bubble
from a level reading.
Set the bubble to read level by means of the slow motion screw to
the telescope axis. Take a rod reading on stake 2,—the distant stake.
Move the horizontal cross wire by means of the screws at right
angles with it, that hold the cross wires in the telescope tube, and set
it so the rod reading on stake 2 will equal the half sum of the former
rod readings on this stake,—the One when the line of sight was level,
and the one when the bubble read level. Whether the telescope
shows objects right side up or not, turn these screws as if to increase
the apparent deviation of the second rod reading from the first.
Loosen the screw permitting the desired movement before turning
the other. Leave the screws under a gentle even strain. If the
difference between the two rod readings is large, loosen the other
pair of screws slightly, but be very careful not to turn the cross wire
ring. Be certain the table stands steady and the rod readings are
correct.
Set the line of sight again level by means of rod readings on both
stakes.
Set the level tube to read level by means of the nuts at one end of
it. Start that nut first that will permit the desired movement. Leave
the nuts under a gentle, even strain.
Test the level tube adjustment by additional rod readings and
finally set it so that R2 — R, = fc when the bubble stands level,—or as
near this condition as may be.
Release the necessary clamps, and reverse the telescope about its
axis and the table on its spindle. Set the line of sight level by rod
readings on both stakes. See if the bubble of the telescope level
(now the same side up again as at first adjusted) reads level. Repeat
the observations and rod readings till sure the line of sight is level,
the table steady, and the bubble gives the same reading. Note the
deviation of the bubble from a level reading.


THE TECHNIC.
If this is considerably less than before, for the other side of the
bubble tube, make the same observations and adjustments for this
side as above detailed for the other.
Release the necessary clamps, reverse the telescope about its axis
and the table on its spindle, and make the tests just above noted,
anew for the side of the bubble tube which is again uppermost.
Repeat these trials, adjustments, and tests, till the telescope
level, and the horizontal cross wire, are so set, that the line of sight
will be level when the bubble reads level whichever side up the bubble
tube may be, as shown by rod readings on both stakes.
If persistant trial under favorable conditions of light, seeing,
temperature, and steadiness, does not complete these adjustments so
they will bear the test imposed, or very nearly so, repeat the work
and make these adjustments so the two sides of the bubble tube will
read the same (not a level reading) when the line of sight is level.
Record this reading, and fasten it in the instrument box.
By these last adjustments the horizontal cross wire is set nearer
its proper place in the telescope tube, if not at that place. The
trouble of these adjustments show the value of such a level tube in
such a place. Once the level tube is proven to be ground alike on
both sides it makes matters somewhat easier. Even with a perfect
level tube there can be no sidewise adjustment and the device is not
nearly as perfect as that of a striding level standing on collars turned
on the body tube of the telescope.
Horizontal cross wire. Striding telescope level.
Preparations.—Set up the table firmly. Level it carefully with the
rule levels. Clamp the spindle so the telescope will stand over a
levelling screw. Clamp the telescope level,—as shown by its striding
level. Adjust the striding level fully as directed in 55. Level the
table by means of the telescope level as directed above. See, at the
last, that the striding telescope level remains in adjustment with
respect to its own feet.
Direct the telescope to some object and find a mark on it in line
with the horizontal cross wire when the table is carefully levelled by
the telescope level, and that level is in good adjustment. Prove the
steps and make sure the conditions are favorable.
Release the necessary clamps. Reverse the telescope about its
axis, and reverse the table on its spindle. Set the telescope level as be-
fore. Be sure the striding level keeps its adjustment. Note the de-
viation of the horizontal cross wire from the mark it covered before.
Move the horizontal cross wire by means of the screws at right
angles with it, that hold the cross wires in the telescope tube, and set
it so it will cover a place midway between the two marks above noted,
when the telescope is level.
Test the adjustment as at first. Repeat the test, correction, and
test, till the horizontal cross wire will cover the same mark with the
telescope either side up, and level.


17
This arrangement of a telescope level is the best for general use.
The same striding level may be made to fit the transit axis also.
61. Vertical Circle Vernier.—If the telescope is provided with a.
level, as above noted in 60, it may be put in adjustment, or the hori-
zontal cross wire adjusted, as directed in that section; the line of
sight set horizontal: and the vernier of the vertical circle set to
read zero when the line of sight is level. This is best, when practic-
able.
Some alidades have a vertical arc in the place of a full circle.
Some have two opposite verniers to the vertical circle, some but one.
Some alidades have two opposite verniers set horizontally, and two
opposite sectors of a vertical circle fitting these verniers. With
opposite verniers an examination should be made to ascertain if the
verniers give readings 180° apart, or sufficiently near so,—that is
within a reasonable limit of instrumental precision, temperature,
perfection of construction, and closeness of reading considered. This
will be ascertained by taking numerous readings on different parts of
the circle, or opposite sectors, both direct and reversed, and compar-
ing them.
If the alidade has no telescope level, and but one vernier to its
vertical circle, or the verniers and circle, or opposite sectors, are not
well centered, and in good working order, this adjustment must be
made by the peg method given for the telescope level in 60,—the
levelling being done by the rule levels. This adjustment then must
depend upon the rule levels. To provide against this, a delicate level
is sometimes attached to the bar carrying the opposite verniers, on
alidades having such, which is controlled by a slow motion screw
similar to the one used for the telescope axis. This level may be used
to level the table with, as directed in 60. These conditions call for
several forms of this adjustment, as was the case with the telescope
level. These are indicated above, except the one given below.
Full vertical circle. Opposite verniers. Set up the table firmly.
Level it carefully by the rule levels. Complete the levelling by the
level for the verniers of the vertical circle, if there is one, as directed
in 60. Set the vertical circle to read, Vernier A, 0° 00' 00" and Ver-
nier B, 180° 00' 00". Turn the table on its spindle; direct the teles-
cope to some object; and find a mark in line with the horizontal cross
wire. See that the table is steady and the levels to be trusted.
Release the necessary clamps; reverse the telescope on its axis
and the table on its spindle; see that the levels show the table to be
steady and levelled; and set the vertical circle to read, Vernier A,
180° 00' 00" and Vernier B, 0° 00' 00". Note the deviation of the hori-
zontal cross wire from the mark at first in range with it.
Repeat the steps of this process till sure of the result shown.
Leave the table and telescope standing so as to show the deviation.
Set the line of sight midway between its two pointings, by means
of the slow motion screw to the telescope axis.


THE TECHNIC.
Move the verniers, by means of the device provided for that pur-
pose, leaving the telescope and vertical circle clamped, and set them
to read 0° 00' 00" and 180° 00' 00". See if the line of sight is still
pointing midway between the two former pointings. If not, repeat
the setting of the verniers till they will read 0° 00' 00" and 180° 00' 00"
with the line of sight so set.
Set the level to the verniers to read level, if there is one, after
setting them to read 0° 00' 00" and 180° 00' 00", as above.
Test the adjustment as at first. Repeat the preparations, tests,
corrections, preparations, and tests, till the line of sight will strike
the same mark whichever side up the telescope may be when the ver-
niers are set for a level line of sight, and the table carefully levelled,
—or as nearly as can be to these conditions.
In case verniers cannot be conveniently set to read 0° 00' 00" and
180° 00' 00"", record, and preserve, the readings corresponding to a
level position of the line of sight.
62. Line of Sight.—If the alidade has a telescope with a level
attached to its body tube, it being in adjustment with respect to the
line of sight, and it is necessary to adjust the vertical cross wire, as
in 53 or 54, some work may be saved by levelling the table for that
adjustment with the telescope level, setting the line of sight level,
and observing some mark in line with the horizontal cross wire, before
beginning the adjustment of the vertical wire. After the vertical
wire is adjusted set the horizontal wire on the same mark, first seeing
that the table is as well levelled, as before, and adjust the telescope
level to read level again, in case it needs it.
It is epecially easy to derange the cross wires whenever all four
cross wire screws are loosened.
If the telescope level is a striding level it is so little work to
adjust the horizontal cross wire that it had better be done instead of
depending on any such device as here given.
63. Centering the Eye-piece.—This is for the purpose of clear
vision, as one might center a magnifying glass more carefully over
an object to be viewed. Frequently there is no way provided for
making this adjustment, and none is needed.
Direct the telescope to the light,—artificial light, or the sky, will
do. By means of the four screws like, or similar, to the cross wire
screws, that hold the ring in the body tube of the telescope, in which
the inner end of the eye-piece slides, set that ring so the cross wires
divide the field of view symmetrically.
64. Objective Slide.—No adjustment of the objective slide should
be needed. At this point the skill of the maker should be manifest.
A test is given below instead of an adjustment. This test will indi-
cate how perfectly the slide is fitted, if the objective is well mounted,
or how well the objective is mounted if the slide is well fitted. Two
imperfections may be present, or but one of them. An adjustment
does not correct the difficulty. It partly hides it.


19
Set up the plane table where a row of stakes can be lined by the
telescope without a motion of any kind except changing the focus of
the objective. Place the alidade centrally on the table and clamp the
telescope in position to do the lining. Weight the rule if there is
fear of its slipping, or insert pins about it in the board. Line out a
row of stakes at measured intervals of fifty feet, to 1,000 or 1,500 feet
away. Use a foresight at the end of the line, or beyond it, to keep
the telescope steady by. Mark points on these stakes precisely in
line, and at the measured distances apart.
Move the plane table to the other end of the line and by trial set
it so the line of sight covers the end marks with no motion but
focussing the objective.- Leave the telescope so set, and clamped.
Line a new set of points at the same places as before. Note their
deviations. There should be none, theoretically.
This test is with respect to line. A similar test with respect to
level may be made by setting points on the sides of tall stakes in the
line of the horizontal cross wire. The horizontal cross wire cannot
be easily set to cover the end marks in the second position of the
plane table. Set the telescope by means of the slow motion screw to
its axis so the line of sight, by the horizontal cross wire, will pass at
equal distances from, and on the same side of, the end marks. Make
a new line of marks. Measure the spaces between these and the
former marks. They should be equal, theoretically.

WHITE LEAD.
J. J. MORSMAN, '93.
Pew people realize the importance of commercial White Lead
and the extent to which it is used in the manufacture of other goods,
and many do not even know that it is the base of all paints, having
any value whatever, excepting possibly artists' colors. Generally
speaking, people do not know how white lead is made and have but a
very vague idea as to its physical and chemical properties, and are
consequently compelled to ask, what is White Lead?
White Lead, i. e., the commercial article, is an amorphous white
pigment, a basic carbonate of lead, having the chemical formula
2 P b C Os P h H2 02. Some would designate it as hydrate-carbonate
of lead or hydroxy carbonate, and others as two parts carbonate of
lead and one part hydrate or hydroxide. The latter would convey to
the uninitiated the better idea, but chemically would not be as nearly
correct as the former, for the reason that White Lead is not always of
the formula 2 P 6 C Oa P b H2 O,, its composition being variable. Some-


THE TECHNIC.
times an analysis reveals the normal carbonate, P b C Os; again, five
parts of carbonate to two hydrate; the proportion of carbonate and
hydrate varying from equal parts of each, to the normal carbonate.
The best is, however, of the formula 2 P b C Os P b H2 On or 3 P b C O3
P b H2 Oj, and possesses great opacity and covering properties, drying
quickly and hard when applied after being mixed with linseed oil, and
forming an elastic coating or paint. It is the hydrate that unites
with the oil, giving the elasticity, but hydrate of lead alone would
have little opacity, this being imparted by the carbonates which
forms an emulsion with the oil. Both are necessary; pure hydrate of
lead would turn yellow and have no opacity; pure carbonate would
have opacity but no elasticity and would chalk off.
The manufacture of White Lead consists in forming from metal-
lic lead basic acetates by action of acetic acid on excess of lead
metal, and the precipitation of basic carbonate, i. e., White Lead,
from the basic acetates by means of carbon dioxide. Excess of acid
would produce the normal acetate, from which basic acetates could
be formed, or the basic carbonate, i. e., White Lead, could be formed
by the combined action of carbon-dioxide and water on the normal
acetate. To formulate:
1. PH 0 = PIjO.
2. P(iO + C,H401 = P(i(OH) (C2 H3 O,).
3. P b + C, H4 O, + H, O = P b (O H) C2 H3 Os) + Ha.
4. P 6 O + 2 Ca H4 02 = P b (C2 Hs Oa)2 + H2 O.
5. P b + 2 C2 H4 O2 = P b (C2 H3 02)2 + H2.
6. H2 + O = H2 O.
7. 3 P b O + 2 C, H4 Oj + Ha O = P 63 (O H)4 (Ca H3 02&gt;2.
8. 0 P b (O H) (C2 H3 02) + 2 C 02 = 2 P.!) CO3Pi)(OH)i + 3 P b
(C2 H3 Oa)2 + H&gt; O.
Referring to the above reactions you will note the basic acetate
formed in 2 and 3, said acetate being the basic acetate formed
with + the amount of acid necessary for producing the normal acetate
(see 4 and 5), the former being the result of action on lead oxide, the
latter on the lead metal, the oxide being formed by the action of
the air on the metal as indicated in 1. In 6,1 merely indicate the dis-
position of the hydrogen formed in 3, in addition to the basic acetate.
Lead oxide is more easily soluble in the acid than is the lead metal,
but whether the acid acts upon the oxide or the metal, the basic acet-
ate is formed, provided there be an excess of oxide or metal. The i
acid salt, or that formed with i the amount of acid necessary for
forming the normal acetate, is soluble in water as well as the acid
salts formed with + the amount of acid necessary for forming the
normal acetate, already referred to. I do not think, however, enough
lead metal would dissolve in the acid to form the i acid salt, but such
would be possible with lead oxide, as in 7, which basic acetate would
answer the purpose.


21
Acting on the basic acetate formed in 2 and 3 with the carbon-
dioxide, we have basic carbonate, i. e., White Lead, normal acetate
as per 8. The normal acetate thus formed could be inverted into
basic acetates, and then acted upon by carbon-dioxide, as in 8, but is
probably changed into basic carbonate, i. e., White Lead, by the
combined action of carbon-dioxide and water, freeing acetic acid
which again acts upon the excess of lead metal.
It must not be imagined that in order to manufacture White Lead
for commercial purposes all one has to do is to look at the above
formula;, take lead metal, acid and water, at the ratio of 207, 60 and
18, the molecular weights in 3, go ahead and produce basic acetate,
and then produce White Lead. As a matter of fact, the ratio of acid
to lead used would be less than 1 to 200.
There are only two processes used to any extent in the United
States, namely: The Dutch, so-called, and the Carter or American
Improved Kremnitz.
The Dutch Process, so-called, is a modifica-
tion of that process, and consists, first in a
physical change in the lead metal from pigs or
bullion or buckles. These buckles, discs, plates,
crates, straps or wickets, as they are variously
styled, are four and one-half to five inches in
diameter: one-eight to one-quarter of an inch
thick, weighing 115 ounces. They are not solid
discs, but contain holes, as shown in figure 1;
the idea being to expose more surface of the
lead metal to the corrosive agents than would
be the case if the metal were used in the form of unperforated discs
or sheets, though the latter would be better than pigs or bullion.
These buckles are made by a machine which it is not necessary to de-
scribe. Suffice it to say, that the lead metal as received from refining
works is melted and an endless chain carries the buckles away.
These buckles are placed in earthenware pots
to the depths of about five inches, as shown in
figure 2, which, however, represents a pot in sec-
tion containing corroded buckles. These earth-
enware pots are about seven or eight inches high
and five to five and one-half inches in diameter,
or of just sufficient size to hold the buckles. In
the bottom of these pots is placed a quantity of
acetic acid, that used being commercial acid,
diluted so as to contain from 2 to 3 % C. P. acid.
Stacks are made with these pots in the following
manner.
A chamber, generally with brick walls, and having about 240
square feet floor surface, is covered to the depth of two or three feet
with spent tan, in which fermentation has begun. This spent tan is


THE TECHNIC.
tanners' refuse, which is taken from the leaches after the tannin or
tannic acid has been extracted from the oak, hemlock or other bark.
In fact, one corroder who employs the Dutch Process, extracts the
tannin from the bark, marketing it in Europe, and using the spent tan
for corroding purposes. The spent tan in the chamber is tapped
down and leveled, and on this surface the earthenware pots are set
close together, containing the acid and the lead metal in the form of
buckles. This layer of earthenware pots does not cover the entire
surface of the spent tan. The space left between this layer of pots
and the walls of the chamber is from 6 to 12 inches. The outside
rows of pots are higher, and upon these pots common boards are laid,
covering the entire layer: or blocks may be used for the purpose of
supporting these boards, the blocks being about two inches higher
than the pots so as to leave about that space between the layer and
the boards. The space between the walls of the chamber and the
earthenware pots is filled with spent tan, and on the boards another
layer is built in similar manner, except that the spent tan is but 10 or
12 inches in depth rather than three feet, as in the case of the first
layer. A succession of these layers to the height of, say 25 feet, is
termed a stack. The space between the pots and the walls of the
chamber is filled in with the spent tan and the top is covered with it.
There is an opening, of course, in the front of the chamber to permit
of the building of the stack. This is closed with ordinary boards as
the stack progresses in height.
The spent tan already in a state of fermentation, gives off car-
bon-dioxide and heats the acetate acid in the bottom of the pots,
causing it to vaporize. The acetic acid vapors act on the buckles,
forming the basic acetate upon which the carbon-dioxide acts. The
time necessary to corrode a stack by this method is from three to f our
months; even then a stack may be torn down and the percentage of
corrosion found to be very small. It is a drawback that the lead can-
be examined during the process of corrosion. The temperature in
these stacks varies, it being almost impossible to keep it uniform, the
temperature rising to 140 or 150 degrees F., and again dropping so low
that action ceases. Some stacks are provided with steam pipes for
the purpose of generating sufficient heat to keep up chemical action.
The amount of lead in a stack varies, of course, according to the size
of the chamber and the height of the stack: there might be three
tons of lead to a layer or seven tons. Some stacks contain as much
as ninety tons, although such a stack would require a chamber with a
floor surface greater than that mentioned above, unless it was built
to an unusual height.
After the chamber has remained unvisited for three or four
months, it is torn down, the pots containing buckles as shown in figure
2, also more or less spent tan that sifted through the boards when
each successive layer was being removed. The percentage of corro-
sion in the Dutch Process does not average 70%, and oftentimes falls


23
as low as 50%. The corroded portion of the buckles is of a hard, com-
pact nature, the exterior being different from the interior, owing to
the fact that the corrosive agents, the acid and gas, corrode the sur-
face of the buckle first and have to act through that already cor-
roded in order to act upon the lead metal still unaffected. In fact, if
you were to cut a buckle in two, just as it is taken from the pot, you
would have in the centre the "blue" or metallic lead, and on each
side hard, compact layers of corroded lead, somewhat different in
texture and color.
The lead is now corroded, at least a certain percentage is, and the
next process consists in separating that which is corroded or partially
corroded, from the metal, which is done by passing the buckles
through rollers or crushers.
The good corrosions are brittle; the poor soft; but in either case
they are easily separated from the blue lead, because the latter is so
malleable, and are remelted into new buckles. A few small particles
of blue lead pass on with the corroded lead, which it is very difficult
to remove. Water is either added to the buckles before they are
removed from the pots or^ at the time they are put through the rollers
or just after, in order to lessen the amount of dust, which is poisonous
if taken into the system by the workmen. In some cases the corroded
lead is not moistened until after it comes from the rollers, at which
time a considerable quantity of water is added, the corrosions being
carried to a water mill, in which they are thoroughly ground; the
coarse lead being returned again and again to the eye of the stones,
the fine being carried on with water. The consistency as it comes
from the water stones is like a thick white pulp, and the process then
consists of thoroughly washing and neutralizing any traces of acetate
of lead, as well as of taking the coarse lead back to the grinding
stones. After the lead is thoroughly washed and settled it is, in the
process under consideration, either dried by evaporating the water
and sold in a dry state, or ground in linseed oil; or while in the pulp
form ground in linseed oil, the lead taking up the oil and a small per-
centage of the water, the remainder of the latter being siphoned off
and the mixture of lead and oil passed through the grinding mills.
This lead is termed "pulp" lead, and is inferior to that where the
pigment is dried before the oil is added, which is styled "pan-dried"
in contrast with " pulp."
As heat is generated when linseed oil is mixed with White Lead,
the conclusion is drawn that there is chemical action between the two,
and I am of the opinion that the linseed oil is saponified to a certain
extent by action of the hydrate or hydroxide in the lead. This is
true as regards the product of the Dutch Process or of the
"Carter."
The Carter Process employs the same chemical principle as the
"Dutch," for that is absolutely necessary, White Lead being made
by chemical action as already indicated, but the materials used for


THE TECHNIC.
the corrosion of the lead are handled in a more modern way, and the
corrosion carried on in a more scientific. manner. The idea of using
the lead metal in the form of sheets rather than as bullion and in the
form of perforated discs or buckles rather than as sheets in order to
expose more surface to the corrosive agents, is carried still further,
in fact to perfection in the Carter Process by atomizing the lead
metal; and again, the idea in using the spent tan in preference to
stable litter for the purpose of generating carbon-dioxide is carried
to a further degree of perfection by burning coke for that purpose,
the gas being thoroughly cleansed and purified.
In the Carter Process the first step is to atomize the pig lead or
bullion, as it is received from the refining works, which is done by
melting the lead in a large kettle, allowing it to flow therefrom
through proper apparatus in conjunction with superheated steam at
a high pressure, the principle being the same as that in the ordinary
nasal or throat spray, the result being a finely divided lead metal: in
fact so fine that it will cover the hands when handled as would graph-
ite or plumbage. This finely divided lead metal is charged in proper
quantity into slowly revolving cylinders five to seven feet in diameter
and eight to twelve feet long. These cylinders revolve continually
day and night, and the lead charged therein assumes a position along-
the cylinder on the side which is turning up, the powdered lead as it
reaches a certain height overturning and falling to the bottom of the
bottom of the cylinder just as would pulverized sugar.
Into the ends of these cylinders at the centre, the carbon-dioxide
is admitted, same being drawn through the purifying chambers by
means of an exhaust fan and from under the boilers where it is
burned, making steam at the same time. The gas as it enters the
corroding cylinders is kept at a uniform temperature, such tempera-
ture being that which experience teaches produces the better finished
product.
The very dilute acetic acid, more dilute than that used in the
Dutch Process, is also sprayed into the corroding cylinders by hand
through the end, and in this manner water is also added. In short,
the lead is contiually agitated, the entire surface being exposed to the
combined and continued action of acetic acid vapors and carbonic
acid gas at the same time. An obvious advantage of the Carter Pro-
cess is the fact that the lead can be examined at any stage of corro-
sion without interfering with the chemical action.
It will be apparent to any one on consideration that the time nec-
essary for the corrosion would be directly proportionate to the fineness
of division of the lead metal, the temperature of the materials and
the concentration of the corrosive agents, but it must be borne in
mind that as the acid acts upon the excess of lead metal it is freed
and again freed to act upon more lead metal, working in a circle, so
to speak. It is not necessary that-strong acid be used, and further, if
this were done, the finished product would be more liable to contain


25
a larger percentage of lead acetate than where the dilute acid is
used.
The temperature in the corroding cylinders is about 140 degrees
F until the lead is corroded, after which it cools off and becomes cold;
however, not until the lead is corroded does the temperature fall. It
must not be construed that in this process the corrosion is perfect,
but it does average at least 95 %, and the remainder is uncorroded,
which is easily separated from the corroded lead,
The lead metal is charged into the cylinder as amorphous powder,
varying in color from a dark blue to a steel gray, and continues dur-
ing the process of corrosion as a powder and finishes as such. It is
then moistened considerably with water and by the revolving of the
cylinder allowed to form into balls varying from the size of buckshot
to a hazel nut. This is done to prevent the dust, which would rise if
the product was handled in the dry state. •
The lead as taken from the corroding cylinders is carried to the
washing machine, which consist of rapidly revolving pronged shafts
inside a cylinder into which the lead is put and a large quantity of
water added. The water holds the lead in suspension flowing from the
machine like milk, and into a series of revolving reels covered with
hundred mesh brass wire cloth or even finer. That which passes
through this fine wire cloth flows on into the first of a series of tubs.
The tailings from these reels are used for making oxides; that is, red
lead, litharge or orange mineral, or are corroded. That which passes
through the reel and on to the first of a series of tubs, as stated, is
allowed to flow from one tub into another, and so on, being constantly
agitated, more water being added, and by this process it is thoroughly
washed. It is then pumped to settling tanks, the best pump for that
purpose being a centrifugal pump, rather than the ordinary plunger
or cylinder pump. After the lead settles in the settling tanks the
water is drawn off and the lead allowed to run into copper-lined dry-
ing pans where the water still contained is evaporated. After the
lead is thoroughly dried it is chased in linseed oil, mixed and ground
and run into kegs, or pulverized while in the dry state, packed in bar-
rels and marketed in that form.
The idea in clashing, mixing and grinding the lead and oil, is
to thoroughly incorporate the two together. That manufactured by
the Carter Process being more amorphous than the product of the
Dutch Process, can be more thoroughly incorporated with the oil, and
will also take a larger percentage. Lead ground in oil for the trade
is sold in buckets, kits and kegs, and when sold dry, in barrels similar
to the ordinary flour barrel, although .somewhat stronger. White
Lead is sold to the manufacturers of prepared paints in the dry state,
that is in barrels; they i adding thereto zinc, whiting, barytes and
various materials, together with linseed oil, depending upon the grade
of paint they make; in fact many paints are put on the market con-
taining no lead whatever.


White Lead is used by all first-class manufacturers who have any
use for paint, such as the manufacturers of agricultural implements,
wagons, buggies: by manufacturers of pottery for the purpose of mak-
ing the glaze, by manufacturers of enamelware, inlaid linoleums,
rubber, etc.
The consumption of White Lead in the United States is between
80,000 and 90.000 tons per annum, and requires for its manufacture a
large proportion of the metallic lead produced. The lead metal used
by the corroder is the best to be obtained, if he desires the best pro-
duct, the lead being refined whether it be the product of soft Missouri
or silver land ores. In the lead metal, that which gives the mbst
trouble to the corroder is bismuth. Traces of antimony or silver im-
part a color other than white to the finished product.
Many substitutes as a pigment have been offered from time to
time for White Lead, -but there is nothing which will beautify and at
the same time preserve that to which it is applied as will White
Lead, and the characteristics of the good article are its affinity for
linseed oil, its opacity and covering properties and its durability as a
paint.
A WYOMING IRRIGATION SYSTEM.
C. T. JOHNSTON, '95.
In the conservation of its waters, the Laramie river has taken
first place among Wyoming streams. The close of the year 1898 will
see its entire discharge impounded and held for irrigation.
With the construction of a reservoir having a capacity of 12,000-
acre-feet in 1897, the work of storing the flood and surplus water was
initiated. In the following year the task will be concluded by the
completion of a reservoir capable of retaining 80,000 acre-feet of
water. These two storage-works will hold all the water discharged
by the river, except the volume used directly from it between May
loth and September 15th.
If the maximum discharge of the stream occurred in July, when
the most water is required for irrigation, the demand for storage
reservoirs would be less imperative. As it is, however, the floods des-
cend from the snow-fed tributaries in the mountains about May 15th,
reach their maximum by May 31st, or June 1st, and then rapidly
decline.
WATER SUPPLY INVESTIGATION.
In promoting the construction of irrigation works having the
magnitude of those proposed to be described, it is necessary to first
determine the water supply. A thorough study of the quantity avail-
able for irrigation is, therefore, a primary step.

DIAGRAM
SHOWING THE MONTHLY AND SEASONAL
IHR1AT10NS IN THE DISCHARGE OF THE LARAMIE BIVEB
The high water of May and June is due to the rapid melting of
the snow which falls during the winter months. If the snow-fall has
been unusually heavy, or if the temperature is low during the spring,
the period of flood discharge may be delayed some weeks. When the
waters begin to recede it is evident that the show has disappeared
from the lower mountains. From this time, therefore, until October
1st, the streams suffer from a want of snow. From October 1st to
May 15th the low waters
are occasioned by a lack
of heat to melt such snow
as has fallen.
Two stream discharge
diagrams are shown here-
with. One indicates the
difference in the dis-
charge of the Laramie
river for three consecu-
tive years, and the other
shows the fluctuation in
the volume flowing during
the six months beginning
April 1st, 1897.
The rapid [rise which
occurred from May 3rd to
May 12th was probably
due to several days of
warm weather in the
mountains. On the 8th
of June the maximum ef-
fect of a cold period is
shown. The small fluctu-
ations in July and August
are due to local storms
more than to the condi-
tion of the weather in the
mountains.
One of the sources of
financial loss, resulting
from investments in west- Fi«- 3-
era agricultural enterprises, is in over-estimating the value of
land which has an inadequate water-supply. Much capital has been
expended in the construction of ditches and other irrigation works
only to find, when profit should begin to accrue, that the quantity of
water is wholly insufficient to properly irrigate the land. For this
reason great care should be taken in preliminary reports that the
volume of water proposed to be used be determined and stated
precisely.


THE TECHNIC.
THE WYOMING DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM.
The land susceptible of being watered under this system of irriga-
tion lies between Sybille creek and Chugwater creek, in Laramie
County. It is an unbroken table land having an area of 60,000 acres.
The soil is a sandy loam and very uniform.
This tract of land was the incentive to the irrigation develop-
ment. Construction began early in the last decade and the details of
the distributing works then planned have been steadily improved
during the last fifteen or sixteen 3-ears.
The first scheme was to build a canal from the mouth of the
DIAGRAM

LA ft A MJK RIVERA T WOODS
Fig. 4-
Laramie river canon as shown by the dotted survey line on the accom-
panying map. Where the survey crossed Sybille creek, a flume 70
feet high and one-half mile long was necessary. Added to this expen-
sive structure the canal line failed to cover a large portion of the
land. Other means were debated and after several preliminary sur-
veys this project was abandoned.
The most feasible plan which presented itself was to turn water
from the Laramie river into Blue Grass creek, a tributary of Sybille
creek, and then construct ditches from the latter stream. The alter-
natives offered for solving this problem were, either to build a canal
some fifty miles in length and discharge it into the headwaters of
Blue Grass creek, or to make a short, but expensive water-way,
between the two streams in the mountains.


30
THE TECHNIC.
As shown by the map the streams draining the Laramie moun-
tains run through the range from the high table lands upon which
Reservoir No. 2 is situated. The elevation of this plain is 7,000 feet
while the land irrigated has an altitude of but 4,500. This geographical
feature makes a canal project, as above described, entirely feasible.
However, during one of the exploration surveys, a tributary of
Blue Grass Creek was followed towards its source until a point was
found which proved to be but slightly over one-half mile from the
Laramie river and over fifty feet below the bed of that stream. The
intervening mountain being eliminated nothing would interfere with
converting Blue Glass Creek into a river.
A tunnel was necessary and as soon as practicable, surveys were
made in preparation for actual work.
THE TUNNEL.
The tunnel is 2,978 feet long, 7 feet high and 8 feet wide. It has a
fall of two feet per 100 for the first 400 feet and one foot per 100
throughout the remainder of its length.
The dam and canal were, first built and 3 turbine wheel was in-
stalled near the north portal of the tunnel. This wheel furnished
power to an air compressor, which in turn, ran drills at both ends of
the work. The air was piped for a distance of one mile over the
mountain, but with little loss, and the work was carried on without
intermission after the plant was erected until the headings met.
The triangulation system which located the center line of the
tunnel was rendered difficult by the broken nature of the mountains
in that locality. Instead of being able to adopt one well-measured
base, five short lines were determined and included in the work. A B
is the only line which can rightly be called a base and it was measured
only to determine A C. This work was checked by various small systems.
It will be noticed by comparing the plat of the triangulation sys-
tem and the cross-section of the mountain along the tunnel line that
the stations H. ,T. and K. occur on the highest points of the line.
The rock through which the tunnel was run is a gneiss with suffic-
ient mica in its composition to prevent chipping under the drill. In
addition to this difficulty attending the drilling the rock was so tena-
cious that only the strongest explosives would effect it. The mate-
rial excavated on the north end of the tunnel was dumped into the
river from the cars. On the south end of the work the rock was
thrown into the natural channel leading to Blue Grass Creek.
The canal leading from the river to the tunnel is 2,000 feet long.
At its head a rock-filled crib dam has been constructed across the
river and a substantial timber headgate has been built. This gate is
but a box having the width of the canal on the bottom, vertical sides
and a length with the canal of 40 feet. The flow of the water is reg-
ulated by four vertically sliding gates which are raised by means of a
lever from above and fall with their own weight when released.


Fig. 6.


THE TECHNIC.
Water first ran through the tunnel in May, 1886. During the first
day the entire mass of rock which had accumulated in the creek at
the lower end of the tunnel, disappeared under the action of but 80
cubic feet of water per second. It is estimated that 7,000 tons, or
14,000,000 pounds, of rock, varying in quality from sand, to stones
weighing 20 pounds, were carried away.
CANAL NO. 1.
Canal No. 1 first diminishes the supply of water thus furnished
Sybille Creek. It is 34 miles long, 25 feet wide on the bottom and in
common with canals No. 2 and No. 3 it has a fall of 2 feet in 5,000 feet
and side slopes of 1 to 1. It carrying capacity is 428 cubic feet per
second.
The headgate is similar to that on the tunnel canal. The dam at
the headgate is a framed structure, built on piles.
In the first ten miles three flumes, supported each 12 feet by piles,
were constructed. These crossed streams which are normally dry, or
nearly so, but being subject to floods ample provision had to be made
for water-way. Driftwood caused considerable trouble and resulted
in the flumes being carried away one or more times. The first one
along the line crossing Dead Head Creek was replaced in 1894 by a
flume suspended on two Howe trusses having a span of 70 feet. This
substitute does not eucroach on the channel of the stream and has
withstood the high water for four years. The tension members can
be tightened as necessity demands.
At Brush Creek, the short span flumes have been superceded by
three wooden pipes each four feet in diameter. These pipes are 275
feet long and have a fall of 10 inches in that distance, and are laid
from 4 to 6 feet underground.
At Sand creek a similar substitute for a flume has been put in.
The pipes are of the same diameter and number. They are 300 feet
long and have a fall of one foot in that distance. This has proven a
simple and economical method for carrying water across ravines or
wherever ditch construction is difficult.
The remainder of the canal is an open cut. Laterals depart from
it as is demanded in the irrigation of the land lying below.
CANAL NO. 3.
This canal was built primarily to fill Reservoir No. 1. It is 15 feet
wide on the bottom, five feet deep and is but eight miles long. Its
carrying capacity is nearly 214 cubic feet per second.
Its most interesting feature is the wooden pipe conveying its
waters under Brush creek. This is but a single pipe, 4 feet in diame-
ter, 400 feet long, and having a fall of one foot in that length.
These pipes are called "inverted syphons" and are protected
from being choked by floating material by vertical timbers placed a
few inches apart across the penstock.


33
CANAL NO. 2.
Canal No. 2 was built to irrigate the north one-third of the land.
It is 22 miles long, 20 feet wide on the bottom, 3A feet deep, and has a
capacity for 340 cubic feet per second. The country through which
it is excavated is an unbroken mesa and in the entire 22 miles there
is no occasion for a flume or syphon.
THE RESERVOIRS—RESERVOIR NO. 1.
Reservoir No. 1 is supplied by canal No. 3 directly and canal No. 1
through its lateral No. 1.
The site is a natural basin covering an area of 400 acres. But
few localities offer a better opportunity for storing water. No em-
bankment was necessary. A means for drawing off the water as it is
needed was all that the completion of the work required.
The outlet is 2,600 feet long. It begins on the reservoir side with
a cut 500 feet in length and varying from 0 to 25 feet in depth. A
stone arch, 50 feet long, 4 feet wide and 4 feet high to the crown leads
from this, where two riveted steel pipes 2 feet in diameter and pro-
tected from the pressure of the earth by concrete, run 50 feet farther
to the valves.
The valves are worked from the surface 30 feet above and are
easily manipulated.
From the valves the water is carried for 10 feet by similar steel
pipes where it runs through two lines of vitrified pipe of the same
diameter, 400 feet to the lower cut, which begins with a depth of
25 feet and runs 1,600 feet to grade. Here two -ditches divert the
water. One follows the contour of the country on a grade of Si in
5,000, and the other acts as a feeder to canal No. 2.
RESERVOIR NO. 2.
This reservoir is on the Laramie Plains. It is 10 miles long and
from a few hundred feet to a mile and one-half broad. The depth
varies from 15 to 50 feet.
The work necessary for its completion consists of an embankment
one mile long, extending across the valley of the river. It varies
from 7 to 30 feet in height.
In the river channel six inclined gates will be placed and these
will be supported by masonry walls sliding in iron grooves. They are
to be operated from above by a rack and pinion device. The rack is
to be bolted to the under side of the gate and the shaft containing
the pinion is to be worked by a hand wheel having a diameter of four
feet. By means of a ratchet wheel on the shaft the gate can be held
in any desired position.
At the northern extremity of the reservoir is a rock ridge, over a
low place in which the surplus water can return to the river channel,

THE TECHNIC,
ARMATURE REACTIONS AS RELATED TO ELECTRICAL
DESIGN.
FRANK C. WAGNER, '85.
The systematic treatment of the design of electric generators
and motors may be said to have had its beginning in the celebrated
paper of Drs. J. and E. Hopkinson, communicated to the Royal
Society of London in April, 1886. The method pursued by the authors
was to select a dynamo whose dimensions and winding were definitely
known, and to calculate what should be the output in volts and am-
peres at a given speed. Experiments were then made with the
dynamo and the actual output was compared with the calculated
value. In this paper the effect of the armature reaction is allowed
for in the calculation.
The manner in which the armature reaction limits the output of
a dynamo or motor, and its relation to destructive sparking were first
clearly presented from a theoretical standpoint by Mr. J. Swinburne
{London Electrical Iterkw, Feb. 14 and 21, 1890), and at about the same
time on its practical or empirical side by Mr. W. B. Esson (London
Electrical Review, Feb. 28, 18001. The papers of Swinburne and Esson
with their empirical formula; have furnished the standard treatment
of this subject, as given in text-books, up to the present time.
During the past year and a half renewed interest has been shown
in the subject of armature reactions, especially in Germany, and im-
portant contributions have been made in the direction of more com-
plete treatment, and of application to modern types of machines.
Special attention should be directed to the papers by Mr. .T. Fischer-
Hinnen published in the Electrotechnische Zeitxchrift, September 17 and
24, 1896, and October 14, 1897. The first paper has been translated
and published in the Electrical World, March 20, 27 and April .'t, 1897.
Most of the text-books upon electrical design treat the subject in
the order of the historical development of the theory instead of accord-
ing to the logic of the design. Certain data must always be given by the
problem itself. such as the electro-motive force at the terminals, the
output, the number of revolutions per minute, and the type of ma-
chine, i. e., whether bipolar or multipolar, continuous current or
alternating current.
The lirst thing to be determined is the diameter and length of th«.-
armature core. This evidently depends upon the number and size of
the conductors to be used. The size of each conductor is readily de-
termined by the allowable current density, which depends upon the
heating limit. It is common in the ordinary text-book treatment to
assume also the number of conductors on the armature, relying upon
the experience obtained by other designers of similar machines.


35
Consequently this portion of the design is purely empirical and there
is nothing to guide the designer when the problem presented is out-
side of the range of ordinary practice. Fortunately, the material
for a theoretical treatment of the subject is at hand, and in what
follows an attempt will be made to put it into shape useful to the de-
signer, and especially to the beginner in electrical design.
The number of conductors on an armature is limited by the ten-
dency to produce sparking in continuous current machines, and by the
self-induction and the distortion of the air-gap induction in alternat-
ing current machines.
In continuous current dynamos and motors the connections of
each armature coil must be reversed at or near the point in the revo-
lution of the armature where the electromotive force generated in
the coil considered is reversed in direction.
When the connections of an armature coil are reversed the ac-
tion of the brushes upon the commutator is first to short circuit the
coil and then to connect it with the other coils in such a way that the
current traverses it in the opposite direction. The effect of short
circuiting a coil in a position where no electromotive force is being t
generated in it is as follows. The current previously flowing in the
coil tends to diminish and would quickly become zero if left to itself.
The induction througn the armature due to the current in the short
circuited coil also diminishes, and in so doing changes the total induc-
tion passing through the coil. As the result of this action an elec-
tromotive force is generated in the coil in a direction which tends to
maintain the current existing before commutation and to oppose the
current existing after commutation. Under the action of this elec-
tromotive force a current is actually maintained in the short-cir-
cuited coil for a length of time depending upon the resistance and
the self-induction of the coil. If this current has not become zero by
the time the short circuit is broken, then its sudden stoppage will
give rise to an electromotive force opposing the current which is to
circulate in the coil after commutation.
In a similar manner the change of induction due to the new cur-
rent produces a counter electromotive force in the coil. The remain-
der of the armature winding furnishes an electromotive force to the
coil equal to the sum of these two opposing electromotive forces, and
as a result there exists for an instant between the two adjacent com-
mutator bars a very considerable electromotive force which drives a
current through the air gap when the brush leaves the retreating
segment. This is the sparking which is observed in all continuous cur-
'rent dynamos when the brushes are not properly set.
If,- instead of commutating the coil in a position where the
induced electromotive force is zero, the position of the coil during
commutation be such that an electromotive force is being generated
in it in an opposite direction to that which tends to produce sparking,
then the sparking may be entirely prevented.


Let the current flowing normally in a single armature coil be rep-
resented by I„ the resistance of the coil by R, the coefficient of
self-induction by L. Let I', be the current flowing at a time T after
RT
the establishment of the short circuit. Then I,'=I, e L (1). Simi-
_ RT
larly, if E, equals I, R, then E', = E, e L (2). This is upon the sup-
position that no other electromotive force is acting in the coil.
If the coil which is being commutated moves through a field,—
supposed to be uniform for the distance the coil remains short cir-
cuited,—which tends to produce an electromotive power equal to E,,
then, in a similar manner, the instantaneous value of the electromo-
tive force due to this cause is E'j = EjV"1—« L J (3). This electro-
motive force should be opposed to the electro-motive force of self-in-
duction. The^actual current flowing at any time T during the short
circuit will be that due to the resultant of these two electromotive
forces, or I = I',—I', = E^~E'« (4).
R
In order that the commutation may be sparkless, the electromo-
tive force produced by the field during the period of the short circuit
should be sufficient, not only to reduce the currents in the coil to zero,
but also to establish a new current in the opposite direction exactly
equal to that which the coil is to carry after the commutation is com-
RT / RT ~\
pleted. That is, E', — E',= — E,.Or,E,e L —E,("l—e L )=— E, (5).

.-. eT = ^ (6&gt;
(e"-0
In any particular case the value of R may be determined by as-
suming the percentage of the voltage to be lost in the armature
Let/be this percentage expressed as a fraction, E the electromotive
force at the terminals, J the total armature current, K the number
of parallel paths through the armature winding, and N, the number
of coils on the armature. Then the entire resistance of the armature
is-'^p , and the resistance of each coil is R = JtT (").
T in equation (0) is the time during which a coil is short circuited.
If 7 represent the width of brush contact surface minus the insula-
tion between two commutator seguments, D, the diameter of the
commutator, and n the number of revolutions per minute, then
The value of L depends upon the style of armature core used.


37
Mr. J. Fischer-Hinnen in one of the papers referred to above, makes
approximate calculations of L for several cases of drum-wound arm-
atures, obtaining the following results:
For a slotted armature in which the width of the teeth is 11 times
the width of the slot, and the depth of slot is three times its width,
L = '^ 2 (9); where I is the length of the armature core in cen-
timeters and N2 is the number of conductors in one coil.
For half-closed teeth of the usual proportions L = 3 (10).

For iron-clad armatures, L = ^J3-2 (H).

For smooth-core armatures, L = - » . (12).

If K is equal to the number of poles, as is commonly the case, and
P be the fractional part of the entire circumference that is covered by
the polar faces, B be the intensity of induction in the air gap, and D
be the diameter of the armature core, then E = "33/ \ D - S(14).
60 X10 K (1 ± j)
Of these quantities K depends upon the type of winding and must
be known or assumed in advance;/can be taken as between .02 and .05
depending on the size of the machine; ~ depends upon the number
of commutator bars and the circumferential width covered by one
brush; /3 depends upon the type of machine and can be assumed at
the outset; B can be assumed as between 5000 and 7000; .1 is given by
the problem; U depends upon the type of armature core and can be
taken as given above. All the quantities in equation (15) are there-
fore either known in advance or may be assumed independently of
the remainder of the design, with the exception of D, the diameter
of the armature, and N„ the number of conductors in one coil.
The values of N2 and D depend upon the total number of conduc-
tors on the armature, which in turn is limited by the cross magnetiz-
ing effect of the armature in a manner to be described presently, and
which also depends upon the fundamental formula for the generation
of electromotive force, viz., E M F = " ° * P (16). C is the to-

The current normally flowing in one armature coil equals ~ .

Hence E, = = XR = (17). From this the value of Ej is readily

found.
Now E2 is the electromotive force which must be generated in the
coil while it is being commutated. It remains to determine the
intensity of induction needed to generate this electromotive force.
Let the intensity of the induction which is being cut by a coil during
commutation be represented by B2. Then E2 = l|o~X~I5r~
„ E-.XfiOXlO8
Hence B&lt; = .DhN.1 (19)-
It is evident that, if B2 be greater than can be obtained in the
interpolar space, no position can be found for the brushes which will
obviate sparking. In such case a different value must be taken for
N,. What is the maximum value of B2 allowable? This depends upon
the effect of the armature reaction in the following manner.
The magnetizing effect of the armature conductors maybe separ-
ated into two parts, that which changes the total induction passing
from one pole piece through the air gaps and armature core to the
other, and that which simply changes the distribution of the induc-
tion over each pole face.
Of the conductors on an armature those lying outside of the
angle of the pole faces serve only to increase or diminish the total
induction from pole to pole. If the plane of commutation is the
medial plane, then the conductors on one side tend to increase the
effective induction and those on the other side tend to diminish it.


The resultant effect is zero. If the plane of commutation be shifted
forward in the direction of rotation, then the demagnetizing conduc-
tors exceed the magnetizing, and the resultant effect is to diminish
the total induction from pole to pole. This is the case in all dyna-
mos. If the plane of commutation be shifted backward, then the
magnetizing conductors exceed the demagnetizing, and the resultant
effect is to increase the total induction from pole to pole. This is the
case in motors.
The conductors lying within the pole face angle produce induc-
tions which pass across the air gap on one side of the conductor,
through the metal of the pole and back across the air gap on the
other side. Since the inductions pass in both directions through the
same air gap, the total induction through this air gap will not be
changed, but its distribution over the pole face will be altered. An
inspection of the paths of the induction shows that at the center of
the pole face the resultant magnetomotive force due to the armature
conductors is zero, because the conductors on either side act oppo-
sitely. As the distance from the center increases, the number of
cross magnetizing conductors becomes increasingly greater on one
side than on the other. At the edge the magnetomotive force is that
due to all the conductors included within the polar angle. Since the
magnetomotive force due to the armature conductors is in opposite
directions across the air gap at the two edges of the pole face, its
effect is to increase the intensity of induction at one edge and to
diminish it at the other edge. Since the plane of commutation is
always shifted toward the pole tip where the induction is weakened,
it becomes a matter of importance to determine what the resultant
intensity of induction at the weakened pole tip is.
Let C equal the total number of conductors on the armature; i
the current through each conductor: and V' the polar angle in degrees.
Then the magnetomotive force at the edge of the pole face due to

the circuit being neglected, and will be Zr^lJlr .
If the intensity of induction due to the field magnets be repre-
sented by B, and the length of the air gap in centimeters by /„, then

upon the value of B,.

drum armatures, or 1 B/0 for ring armatures. Hence the limiting
values of the armature ampere terms are given by the following
equations:
For drum armatures, Ci = ~B lo (20).
For ring armatures, Ci -~B l0 (21.)
It is to be observed that equations (20 and (21) take no account of
the self induction of the armature coils. They may be used to ob-
tain a first approximation to the allowable number of conductors on
the armature, but the final calculation, and also the division into coils
should be made by reference to equations (6), (15), and (19).
Attention should also be directed to the advantage of multipolar
machines over bipolar as shown by equations (20) and (21). The maxi-
mum ampere turns is inversely as the polar angle, that is, directly as
the number of poles, if the value of B and I o be fixed.
Various devices have been suggested to overcome the evils of
sparking, the most important of which are the Sayers winding, devel-
oped in England, and the Ryan device, which has been brought out in
this country. However, by the use of multipolar machines for large
capacities satisfactory results are obtained, so that such devices have
not the importance they would otherwise have had.
By the use of the foregoing analysis and formulae, the maximum
total number of conductors on the armature, and also the maximum
number of conductors in one coil can be determined. If it is possible
to secure a suitably proportioned armature with a less number of con-
ductors, so much the better. But the maximum values obtained
must not be exceeded.
To illustrate, let it be required to design a 200-kilowatt dynamo to
give 100 volts at 300 revolutions per minute.
If a bipolar dynamo of the closed coil type be adopted, then one-
half of the entire current will flow through each conductor, and
% equals ^J**0^ - 1000 amperes. If * - 130 degrees, and B = 6000,

then 1000 C =-j^g X 6000 lo; whence C = 17.6 I o . Let the armature
be slotted. Then lo might be made only just large enough to give me-
chanical clearance, or 0.4 centimeter, whence C = 7; i. e., thenumberof
armature conductors cannot exceed 7. Evidently this is not sufficient to
give a good construction of commutator. If C be taken as 64, giving a
commutator of ,'12 segments, then lo = 3.6 centimeters or 1.42 inches.
With a current density of 3000 amperes per square inch, the cross
section of each conductor is i square inch, or 1 inch by ft inch. If I
inch be allowed for the circumferential width of each conductor and
and its insulation, and inch for the iron between slots, then the
diameter of the armature becomes 64 X \ \ -+- V = Is) inches, or 48
centimeters.

tive force remaining is 2000 lo. The magnetomotive force over the air

cross magnetizing effect of the armature current, is 6000 lo plus

the plane of commutation is 12.7 minus 11.3, equal to 1.4 centimeters
or 0.55 inch, away from the pole tip. Stated differently, the angle
through which the brushes must be shifted from the medial plane is
.89 of the distance to the pole tip.
Mr. Pischer-Hinnen found that in practice when the angle through
which the brushes are shifted is more than .75 of the distance to the
pole tip, the machine is apt to spark badly. Consequently, although
the assumed data satisfy equations (16) and (20), which are the condi-
tions ordinarily specified in the text-books, yet the dynamo would not
operate satisfactorily. The remedy is either to increase lo, which is
already too large for economical field coils, or, what is much better,
to adopt the multipolar type of machine,

THE TECHNIC,
NOTES ON RAILROAD BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION*
HENRY GOLDMARK, A. B.
The railroad system of the United States constitutes at the pres-
ent day more than half the total railway mileage of the world. As a
machine for the economical transportation of freight, it is unrivalled
elsewhere, as the rate per ton-mile is very much lower than in any
other part of the world. The economic importance of this fact need
not here be enlarged upon. It has been brought about mainly by the
great improvements in engines and rolling stock made during the past
twenty years.
There has also been much improvement in the roadbed, track and
bridges, but it does not seem to me that the advance has been pro-
portionally great in this direction. Certainly a large part of our
railroad track and structures does not compare favorably with the
average in other countries. With the exception of certain trunk
lines, of high excellence, most of our roads still show in their narrow
embankments and cuts, their poor drainage, their insufficient ballast-
ing and the large amount of timber trestling, the economic pressure
for immediate results UDder which they were built. In saying this, I do
not forget, that in many cases, these were good and sufficient reasons
for economy, and that the opening up of our vast territory would have
been impossible without much work that lacks permanence.
At the present time, when few new lines or extensions are under
way or projected, the improvement of existing roads may probably
engage our attention.
In my remarks this evening, I mean to confine myself to one
phase only of railroad improvement, although an important one, that
of bridge structures. I intend to dwell particularly upon certain
practical considerations that should govern in the design and con-
struction of the ordinary railroad bridge, rather than to discuss the
determinations of strains, or the details of shop work.
By "ordinary'' railroad bridges are meant spans of moderate-
length, say up to 150 or 175 feet, over which trains usually pass at
full speed. The great majority of all railroad bridges belong to this
class.
The design of long spans over wide rivers is in many respects
an entirely different problem and is to a great extent independent of
conditions prevailing on the rest of the line. The location of such
bridges can often be made to depend wholly on the hydraulic and
topographical conditions since they are of sufficient importance to
influence the alignment of the road or to call for the building of
special approaches. In their construction, the dictates of theoreti-
cal economy can often be closely followed.

The shorter bridges, on the other hand, are merely a part of the
roadbed, and their construction should be governed entirely by traffic
requirements. It should always be borne in mind that a bridge of
this kind, is in no sense, a monument or thing of beauty, which is an
end in itself. However interesting it may be to us as a piece of con-
struction, its doing, its necessity at a given point must be fully
established and its construction must merely be such as to ensure the
required work in as efficient a manner as possible.
Considered as a part of the roadbed, any bridge or cattleguard,
is objectionable.
In the first place, except in the case of temporary trestling or
high viaducts, its first cost is always much greater than that of an
equivalent length of embankment or excavation. In the second place
the cost of inspecting and keeping in repair wooden and metallic
bridges is always considerable, while the ordinary roadbed involves
little expense for maintenance.
Last but not least.—Every additional bridge or cattleguard
increases the care and responsibility of keeping the track in a proper
condition for the safe and easy passage of trains. In case of a
derailed truck or of even slight injury to the rolling stock, the chances
of a serious accident are much increased by the break in the roadbed,
involved in the .presence of a bridge. For this reason, any structure
removed from the line, lightens pro-tanto, the load of responsibility
which rests on the shoulders of the officials directly charged with the
operation of the.road and improvements of this kind are gladly wel-
comed by them.
Competent locating engineers, as a rule, appreciate the consid-
erations just mentioned, although, I believe, that in many cases, a
more detailed knowledge of bridge superstructure, would show them
how to reduce the total amount of bridge work without either increas-
ing the length of the line or changing it for the worse in respect to
gradients or curvature.
At best, however, with the conditions under which locations must
usually be made, mistakes in the number, the length and the char-
acter of the bridges, will be unavoidable, which will be apparent in
the light of later experience. There is often little chance to ascer-
tain the nature of the streams crossed nor the extent and character
of their watersheds. Even flood discharges and high water levels
must often be guessed at, from the unreliable statements of " old
residents." Hence, ordinary prudence generally leads to the use of
rather excessive waterways although in other cases the spans prove
to be too small, while an enforced economy of time and money
introduces much timber trestling not called for by hydraulic consid-
erations. In place of masonry abutments, framed piers of timber,
sometimes filled with loose stone, are often used as a temporary sup-
ports for iron or timber spans. This practice of not building the
masonry structures until later has much to recommend it, as it


44
THE TECHNIC.
avoids the necessity of using stone from untried quarries, which may
not stand the weather. On some roads the temporary*timber piers
and trestling are placed in such a position as to leave a clear space
for building the masonry afterwards. Foresight of this kind fre-
quently saves time and money.
Arches and Culverts—As to the character of the permanent
structures, those that approximate most closely to the unbroken
roadbed, are the best from the operating standpoint. I refer, of
course, to the covered culverts or arched bridges. Their use for
small spans, is quite common; for large streams, arches are little
used on account of their greater first cost. If the expense of main-
taining and replacing less durable work, were taken into account, the
ultimate economy of the arch might often be made plain.
In case there is little water, one or more square box culverts,
covered with stone slabs are the cheapest and best outlet for drain-
age. Where stone is scarce, cast-iron pipes may be substituted up to
a diameter of 6' or even more. Their use has been entirely satisfac-
tory. Tile drains are cheaper and easier to lay, but are very easily
broken under traffic, and expensive to replace.
Culverts of circular section up to 8' or more in diameter and
built entirely of cement have also been used on some western roads.
On the new water supply system for the city of Boston, now under
construction, many miles of such conduits are being built of con-
crete instead of brick. Their use on railway work is likely to be
more common in the future. The wooden molds can be used many
times in different places and improved methods of mixing and ram-
ming the concrete can be employed where there is much work of the
kind to be done. Portable machinery would ensure a more homo-
geneous mixture than can be obtained by handwork.
It seems to the writer a mistake to insist on the use of Portland
cement in all cases. The native Natural Cements cost less than
one-third to one-quarter as much and if used in somewhat more
generous proportions, give a sufficiently strong product at much less
expense.
Repairs of Masonry.—A further use of cement mortar may here be
referred to, namely its application to the repair of masonry struc-
tures disintegrated by the weather. For this purpose, a very strong
dry mixture with the best Portland cement must be used and if pos-
sible, mixed by machine. The masonry must be thoroughly cleaned,
loose pieces removed and the joints raked out to a depth of several
inches. A wooden mold is placed, so as to leave an intervening space
of from 4" to 10" between the lagging and the old surface of the mas-
onry. This interval is filled with the cement mortar or beton, which
is thoroughly rammed into all crevices and joints. In this way, an
entirely new surface is put over the old work, which is protected from
the weather and more firmly united. I have had occasion within a
year or two to examine carefully some repairs of this kind made on


Notes on railroad bridge construction. 45
the Erie railway nearly 20 years ago. The surface of the cement
mortar was found to be absolutely perfect and free from cracks. It
was very hard and showed plainly the shapes and joints of the timber
lagging used in the molds.—The structures thus repaired comprised
a large number of arch culverts and bridge piers. The method was
described by Mr. O. Ghanute the Chief Engineer of the railroad in a
paper read before the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1880.
The original masonry was, in many cases, in the last stage of decrepi-
tude, while at present, after 20 years service the culverts and piers,
as protected are entirely sound and promise to last a long time. The
cost of such repairs, is only a small percentage of what new masonry
would cost, particularly, where a culvert is built under a high em-
bankment, making the expense of excavating it very great.
The selection of durable building stone is" by no means easy.
Mineralogical study may be of some assistance though the test of
actual use is the only certain guide. In many localities, such as Chi-
cago, no reliable local stone can be found, and the nearest available
quarries are fully 150 miles away, so that the freight rate adds nearly
$1.50 to the cost of each cubic yard. In such localities the use of hard
burned brick and concrete would give a good reliable substitute for
stone. Brickwork is thus used in the northern part of Germany and
in Holland, almost to the exclusion of stone.
In most bridge piers and abutments, as well as in arches, great
compressive strength and hardness are not essential in the stone
used, as the stresses developed are small. Soft sandstones can often
be found which can be cheaply worked, and weather perfectly. The
cost of cutting them is $2 to $3 cheaper per cubic yard than for the
harder limestones.
The cost of masonry may also be reduced by omitting all copings,
ornaments and unnecessary cutting, and by using concrete or rubble
for backing. In fact, if carefully built with good cement mortar,
rubble masonry is a very good substitute for cut-stone, and is too lit-
tle used for ordinary rail road work. It is the standard construction
for the best built German railroad lines, where the art of making a
good quality of masonry with cheap materials has reached a high
stage of perfection. The bad reputation which rubble masonry has
obtained in the United States is due largely to the poor shiftless work
palmed off on railroad companies under this name.
Foundations.—For that portion of the work which is below ground
rubble or concrete should generally be used. In wet pits or in local-
ities where it is dangerous to the track to keep an excavation open
for any great length of time, the use of concrete permits the filling
in of the foundation in a shorter space of time than the employ-
ment of any other material.
The foundation for arch culverts should of course be especially
unyielding. Where the bed rock does not come to the surface,
piles are generally used, though they are not very desirable, unless


THE TECHNIC.
the amount of material in the abutments is sufficiently great
to make the resultant pressure on the foundation nearly vertical.
Where the bedrock is only from 6 to 10 feet below the ground,
the choice of the best method of foundation becomes difficult. Piles
are rather short under these conditions and are likely to yield side-
ways, if the soil is at all soft. I can recall several instances in which
short piles driven in a soft bottom caused the failure of well built
bridge abutments reared upon them.
A method of foundation used by the speaker in a similar situa-
tion may be of interest. The structure to be supported was an eight-
foot culvert for a double track railroad under an embankment about
20 feet high. There was a Arm soap stone at a depth of 9' below the
ground, overlaid by a soft wet clay. The building of a concrete foot-
ing would have doubled the cost of the culvert. For this reason, it
was decided to use instead of concrete, a bed of crushed rock resting
on the soapstone.
The material used consisted of crushed tailings from a zinc mine,
the size of the separate pieces varying from 2i inches to that of a
pea. The pit was excavated to the bed rock and the crushed ballast
shovelled directly into it from a car standing on a trestle immediately
above, so that the fall of 20 feet or so caused the filling to become
well compacted. Water from a hose was used to wet it down and
cause it to settle more closely.
This foundation presented much the same appearance as a good
natural bed of gravel and has proved entirely satisfactory. Its cost
was about one-fifth of that of a concrete or masonry foundation.
A somewhat novel substitute for timber piles may also be men-
tioned here which has recently been used by Mr. H. W. Parkhurst
engineer of bridges, on the Illinois Central Railroad in places where
an ordinary pile foundation would come above the line of permanent
ground water.
The method employed consists simply in driving piles, spaced as
usual, but withdrawing each pile as soon as it is driven and filling up
the hole with concrete. All the stone piles are then covered with a
thick bed of concrete on which the masonry pier is built. The
advantage of reaching hard bottom is thus obtained at a moderate
cost.
Trestles.—The timber trestles on American railroads have a
greater aggregate length than all other forms of bridging.
Certain designs differing only in details, have become standard.
They are undoubtedly of ample strength even under heavy traffic, and
in fact are often stronger than the iron bridges on the same line.
They are always subject to great danger from fire, and some of our
worst railroad accidents have been due to the burning of trestles.
Even when well built, they are hard to keep in good alignment and
grade and need many minor repairs from time to time. For this rea-
son, they occupy much of the bridge superintendent's time and atten-


tion, and use up a great part of his appropriation. The desirability
of replacing trestles by some more durable construction should al-
ways be borne in mind. This will usually involve the preparation of
comparative plans and estimates by the Engineering Department.
On many roads timber trestles are removed several times, when
it would be really good policy to rebuild in stone or iron. A valuable
improvement in trestle floors has lately been mada, by using a ballas-
ted floor on which the track can be laid as in the ordinary roadbed.
In. this case a continuous timber floor is built on the caps of the bents
wide enough to hold the crushed rock or gravel filling.
The added security against fire first led to the adoption of this
form of construction for the long trestles of the Louisville and Nash-
ville railroad. It has since been used on the Illinois Central railroad
and on other Southern lines.
Wooden Bridges.—Wooden bridges are gradually going out of use,
though they have given excellent service in the past. At present
prices, the cost of steel spans is but little greater, and the latter are
of course preferred.
The history of American railroad bridges built of timber is of
great interest. A large number of different types were introduced
from time to time, and gradually discarded in favor of those that
best stood the test of actual service. With nothing to guide them
but their own judgment and common sense, the early bridge builders
accomplished results which challenge our admiration.
Their successors have more science and experience and more me-
chanical resources in various kindred industries to draw upon, but in
jnany cases, have not built structures as well adapted to the work
they have to do. Of many interesting truss forms, the Howe truss
and the Towne lattice are the only ones still used, apart from com-
bination bridges in which iron members play a prominent part.
The Howe truss is used all over the world and is too well known to
need description. The Towne lattice is still quite largely used on
New England and Canadian railroads, and gives good satisfaction.
The trusses are generally built with at least two thicknesses of
web timbers and 3 chords. Three by twelve pine is usually employed
throughout with carefully fitted oak pins at all intersections. The
framing must be very carefully done, but if they are well built, the
trusses are very stiff, durable and inexpensive.
Combination bridges in which all compression truss members are
of wood, while the tension ties and the floor beams are of iron, are
quite generally used. They can of course be built of ample strength
but, at least for short spans, it is very hard to devise details which
shall not produce a loose jointed structure with much unnecessary
vibration and "back lash " in the different parts.
Iron Spans.—The iron spans are the most important and expen-
sive structures on railroad lines, and should receive the most care-
ful study from railway managers and engineers. Unfortunately,


THE TECHNIC.
these officials have, in the past, quite generally divested themselves
of their responsibility in the matter, by depending on bridge building
firms for both designs and construction.
Notwithstanding the high standing of our large bridge building
companies, there are many strong reasons, why it is unwise for rail-
roads to entrust them with the preparation of plans instead of merely
the execution of designs worked out by engineers in the direct em-
ploy of the railroads.
It would lead too far to give these reasons in full; it will be suffic-
ient to point out the fact, that in all competitive designs, the first
cost in the shops will be sure to cut altogether too great a figure,
instead of the much more important considerations of permanence
and rigidity.
The experience of examining many existing bridges in different
parts of the country built under various conditions, has convinced me
that the competitive system is certain to give unsatisfactory results.
In selecting the type of bridge to be used for such spans as com-
monly occur on railroads, the necessity for rigidity must always be
borne in mind, and a stiff construction selected, even if it is more
expensive, than some other design of equal static strength.
From this standpoint pin connections, while an excellent detail
for long spans, are very poor for the majority of railroad bridges,
especially in case eyebars are used for tension members.
Recent practice favors plate and riveted lattice girders up to
lengths of 125 to 150 feet. There can be little doubt that they are
likely to supplant all other forms except for very long spans.
Some engineers are much troubled by the fact that the stress,
determinations in plate and lattice girders are apparently more
complex than in pin bridges. In fact for a long time our specifica-
tions prescribed a lower unit stress in plate girders than in any other
type, although the test of experience was all the time loudly pro-
claiming their greater strength. Many well designed plate girders
were condemned and removed from the track because their strain
slightly exceeded 12,000 lbs. per square inch, while pin bridges with
"A" x \" suspenders carrying 15 foot panels were allowed to remain
because the orthodox unit stress laid down for such cases was not
exceeded.
A properly prepared strain sheet is, as we all know, a very valu-
able guide in bridge design, if used with intelligence and judgment.
Unfortunately the last named proviso has not always been borne in
mind; the strain diagram has often become a sort of fetich, and any
structure which could be made to conform to it, has been thought tit
for use. On many, if not most of our railroads, may still be found
bridges, which conform quite well to the usual strain sheet require-
ments, but are actually far below a proper standard of strength.
This may be the case, even where the details and connections are
not exceptionally weak, simply because the entire design is bad. It


49
is a mistake to speak of such structures as being theoretically correct
and practically bad. As a matter of fact, the designs are at fault
because, they do not take account of important forces and conditions,
which need to be considered. They are as bad in theory and as in prac-
tice.
Floors.—The flooring is the part of the bridge which first receives
the weight and impact of the moving load. For this reason it should
have an ample margin of safety; both for ordinary conditions and in
case of accident to rolling-stock. Derailments are unfortunately of
very frequent occurrence, and no floor is well designed, which does
not make careful provision for carrying trains, which reach the bridge
with one or more trucks oft the track or which become derailed on
the bridge.
On a prominent railroad, I was informed by the superintendent
that there was not a single bridge on his lipe, the ties of which
were not marked by the passage of at least one derailed truck. My
own experience tends to corroborate this seemingly exaggerated
statement.
The only safe floor is one which is practically continuous and so
designed as to allow a derailed wheel to roll over it in safety.
If of timber the ties should be at least 8" thick and spaced not
over 6" apart in the clear. There should always be guard rails at
least 6"x8" fastened to the ties by "dapping" and by bolts which
pass through at least every third tie. The ties should extend across
the full width of the bridge and be supported on a sufficient number of
stringers to insure them against breaking under the concentrated
load of a wheel in any possible position.
The Latimer guard, a cast iron block which is placed at the ends of
the bridge, is a good device for rerailing wheels that are off the track.
Even if it does not do this, it will often cause the derailed car to
travel parallel with the rail and thus keep it from striking the trusses
of through bridges.
The last danger mentioned, that of a passing car striking the
trusses, is very great in cases of derailment, and has probably caused
the total destruction of more bridge spans than any other cause.
Deck bridges are free from this risk, and for this reason, among
others are to be preferred whenever they can be used. They are also
more easy to brace laterally, and are less expensive particularly if
the timber ties are laid directly on the top chords.
The masonry for deck spans is also cheaper than for through
bridges, and it will often be found practicable to build a series of short
plate girder spans resting on masonry piers for less money than a
longer deck through combination or Howe truss. Of course the hy-
draulic conditions must be such as to allow this arrangement of piers.
Even on deck bridges the floor should be of sufficient width to make
the risk of having a derailed train run off into the stream no greater
than on the approach embankment on either side, This has rarely


THE TECHNIC.
been done, although the widening of bridge floors, is the greatest im-
provement as to the safety of our bridges that can be made.
A word should be given to the so-called " continuous " iron floor
systems. They are quite usual in England and are being introduced
on some of our roads, particularly in cities. Such floors, whether built
of troughs or simply of I beams covered by top plates make, a very
secure platform for trains, whether off or on the rails. The principal
objections are their greater cost and the necessity of frequent in-
spection where the troughs are filled in with ballast.
For trunk lines they have proved satisfactory on the New York
Central railroad, and are likely to be used more largely on roads of the
better class, though they will hardly displace the wooden floor until
timber is much more expensive than at present.
Conclusion.—In closing these somewhat desultory remarks, I may
be permitted to point out the field in railroad bridge departments
which is open to men of proper technical training and experience. In
the days when Howe truss and trestle bridges were exclusively used,
the bridge superintendents got their training entirely in the work
shop and the field.
At the present time, when the most important structures are of
iron, there is an opening for men, who have a detailed knowledge of
bridge engineering.
Such knowledge can only be obtained by work in the draughting
room, the shop and in the erecting gang. It should include experi-
ence in the inspection of material in the steel works; the rolling
mill and the bridge shop.
All this work cannot be done without much drudgery, exposure to
the weather, and soiling of hands, but in no other way can all sides of
the subject be mastered.
Some few great engineers are born, not made. But for most of
us, success can only be hoped for, as the result of hard, long con-
tinued, intelligent effort.
Even the best school training can only help us, by showing us how
to approach each subject as it presents itself, in a scientific manner,
i. e. divesting it of unimportant side-issues, and allowing the light of
our reason to play upon even the smallest questions.
It is this spirit that distinguishes the educated from the unedu-
cated man, the progressive engineer from tbe one who is satisfied

* AND ITS DESTRUCTION.
W. D. BALL, '90.
Among the many tribulations which formerly troubled the spirit
of the electrical engineer is the angle of lag * caused by the self in-
duction of alternating current circuits. Although we know now that
this trouble can be simply and practically overcome, yet it is in com-
paratively few cases that this is done and then often by the cut and
try method. The so-called practical man says this is all right and
that he can produce as good results as the man who has wasted his
time studying theory. We do not deprecate experience; it is neces-
sary, but the educated engineer finds that a few figures before hand
often saves many dollars afterward.
The writer has recently found that to be the case in a plant that
he was called upon to redesign, and it may be of interest to some who
have not yet met the problem in practice to take this plant as an il-
lustration and point out the method of campaign for destroying *.
The load in question consisted of 10,000 incandescent lamps, 125
street arcs, 125 commercial arcs, a street railway using about 100 K.
W. and about 200 K. W. in stationary motors.
Now before we can destroy * we have to find out how large it is
going to be, and here is where good judgment is needed as much as
much as knowledge. There are three kinds of apparatus in this
plant that produce a lag of the current viz., rotary field motors, trans-
formers and arc lamps. The latter are constant and easily calcu-
lated, but the self-induction of the motors and transformers varies
inversely with the load. The only thing that can be done in a case
like this is to find the worst possible condition and make arrangements
to take care of this. If, however, we have neutralized the largest
angle of lag, we will produce a leading current, which is just as harm-
ful, when this angle of lag in the circuit decreases. It is easy enough
to vary this neutralizing effect but the trouble is to know just how
much neutralization is needed. There is no commercially practical
instrument, to the writer's knowledge, which can be used for showing
the angle of lag in a circuit though he has just designed a very sim-
ple instrument for this purpose. It is as yet only on paper, but if we
can get such an instrument, it will be a simple matter for the station
attendant to adjust the neutralizing effect as the lag varies, provided
the variations are not too sudden and violent.
It might be well to give the assumptions and calculations that
were made in the above case for calculating the angle of lag.
The alternating current arc lamps to be used, took 6 amperes and
burned at 70 volts D. P. across the arc. Inasmuch as it was necessary
to have an economy coil in the lamp for the sake of steadiness, it was
determined to use the same voltage for them as for the incandes-


THE TECHNIC.
cents; namely 115 volts. It was found that to put them on the same
secondaries would not appreciably affect the lag in the secondaries
with the given number of lamps in circuit.
The apparent watts per lamp was 115 X 6 = 690. The actual
watts according to the manufacturers was 450. The power factor
450
would be then cos. * = 5=3 = .652.
690
Now in dealing with circuits containing resistance and reactance
we have to do with vector quantities, and if these resistances and re-
actances are in parallel, it is necessary to add vectorally the recip-
rocals of the quantities in order to get their combined impedance.
The simplest way to do this is to find the horizontal and vertical com-
ponents of these quantities both in direction and magnitude add alge-
braically all the horizontal components together and all the vertical
components together and then find the resultant of these sums. This
gives the reciprocal of the impedance in direction and magnitude.
Taking the reciprocal of this gives us the impedance and, the di-
rection being known, the resistance and reactance factors are at once
determined and from them the angle of lag.
The worst condition that will probably obtain on the lighting cir-
cuits if the arcs are fed from the same transformers as the incandes-
cents is a load of 4000 incandescents and 125 arcs.
The reciprocal of the resistance of one incandescent is .00425
which should be plotted horizontally. The impedance of one arc lamp
is 19.17, the resistance 12.5, and the reactance 14.56. Describing this
triangle we have the direction of the impedance. Taking its recip-
rocal and resolving it into its components we find the horizontal or
g component is .034 and the vertical or =- component is .07.
Adding then all the horizontal components we have (.00425 X 4000)
+ (.034 X 125) = 20.25. The sum of the vertical components is like-
wise .04 X 125 = 15. The reciprocal of the combined impedance on
the secondaries then is v/20.25i + 15' = 20.8 approximately. Hence
the impedance is .048, the resistance is .0466 and the reactance .0115.
The power factor in the secondaries is '—jrja = 97%.
Now the worst condition to be taken care of in this case will prob-
ably take place during the day when the load consists mostly of mo-
tors. It is impossible to determine before the plant is in operation
what the load and consequent self-induction will be so we must judgre
from the circumstances of the case and assume what the average load
will be. Having this determined, the power factor for both the mo-
tors and transformers is obtained from the curves showing the rela-
tion between the load and self-induction.
The average load was calculated to be 225 K. W. for the motors,
50 K. W. for street railway and 70 K. W. for incandescent lights, the
arc light being shut down during the day. The power factors were


53
found to be .85, .90 and .70 respectively, of which the combined power
factor is approximately .83, giving a lag of 34".
It is necessary then to install such apparatus as will neutralize
this lag. This, a synchronous motor or rotary transformer will do.
In the station in question both will be in use, rotary transformers to
operate the street railway and a synchronous motor to run a street
arc light machine. Either or both of these machines could be used
and they would be required to have their fields overexcited to such
an extent as to give a current with 34° lead. Moreover the capacity
of the machine used must be at least equal to the excess current re-
^^(1 cos *P)
quired by the power factor found. This current is —y cos wnere
W = watts and V = E. M. F. When using 350 K. W. at 2,500 volts* the
motor must have a current capacity of at least ok— ~ 28.75
r J 2500 X .83
amperes. This requires a 75 K. W. motor.
If a load curve can be obtained, a similar calculation should be
made for other loads so as to be sure that the maximum condition of
lag is found. In the particular case in question this was done and the
above found to be the maximum.
It was a particularly fortunate circumstance that the old plant
had a 60 K. W. arc machine and a 120 K. W. generator.. The latter
will be used as a synchronous motor to drive the former in which case
there will be plenty of capacity left to take care of the lag.
It often pays to install a synchronous motor and run it idle simply
to compensate for lag. It can be readily seen that a great part of
the money spent for the motor can be saved in generators and all the
useless CJ R losses saved. It can be calculated in all cases whether or
not it would pay to install a motor for this purpose by checking the
interest on the investment plus the depreciation against the yearly
cost of coal to supply the C2 R loss.
LAW HINTS FOR ENGINEERS.
GEO. W. LILLY, '81.
It is now a recognized fact that the engineer should at least know
the fundamental principles of law as applied to matters with which
he must constantly deal. Recognizing the importance of such knowl-
edge and its advantage to the engineer, some of the technical schools
have provided for their students, lectures on the law of Engineering.
Only a few points can be touched upon in the limits of this article,
but it is hoped that the direction in which investigations may profit-
ably be extended, may at least be in part pointed out. It will be nec-


THE TECHNIC).
essary to confine our attention to a few points, leaving many import-'
ant questions untouched.
Of those not touched upon it may be well to suggest that the law
of Riparian rights, accretions and relictions, the law of eminent do-
main as applied to engineering enterprises, the right of owners of
buildings already built or unobstructed light, and to support of such
buildings by adjoining land, preventing removal of earth so as to en-
danger the foundation of such building, the law of surveys, etc., should
also be investigated by the engineer who wishes to be well equipped
for his work. It is not supposed that the engineer will become a law-
yer, but that he should have sufficient knowledge of law to guide him
in his every day duties in the ordinary questions which arise in his
practice.
THE ENGINEER AS AGENT.
An engineer in his relations to his employer is an agent, and his
duties, powers and liabilities are in a large measure determined by the
law of agency. He has, ordinarily, only special powers, namely, to
engineer and superintend the work in hand and to direct it in accord-
ance with the terms of the contract. He has no power to make a con-
tract on the behalf of his employer nor to modify a contract already
made, unless specially empowered to do such acts. It is his duty as
agent to adhere strictly to the terms of the contract and his instruc-
tions.
As agent the engineer must act in good faith with his employer.
An instance of bad faith is a case where the engineer is secretly in.
terested in the contract and receives part of the profits derived by
the contractor for performing the work, or is also employed by the
contractor without the knowledge of the owner who employs him.
There is one element in the relations of the engineer and his em-
ployer which does not always exist between an agent and principal.
The engineer by undertaking to act in his professional capacity, im-
pliedly contracts that he is possessed of at least the average degree
of learning and skill in his profession, and that he will exercise his
skill and learning with reasonable fidelity and care; and he is liable to
his employer for loss occasioned by his lack of such professional
knowledge and skill, or by his negligence in the performance of his
duties.
Judge Cooley says: "He does not undertake for extraordinary
care or extraordinary diligence any more than he does for uncommon
skill." Reasonable care and fidelity he must exercise. And by this is
meant such care and fidelity as an ordinarily prudent and careful en-
gineer would exercise.
Another important rule of the law of agency should here be no-
ticed. The owner or principal employing the engineer, is charged
with knowledge of matters relating to the work which are known to
the engineer. This is true whether the engineer has reported such
matters to his employer or not. One duty which the engineer owes to


55
his employer is to promptly give him notice of such things coming to
his knowledge as may effect his obligations to others. It has been
held that the employer was bound and could raise no question of the
due completion of a contract, if his engineer, who had watched the
progress of the work, and inspected it while being done, and so know-
ing the character of the work performed, had given his certificate of
the completion of the work and the amount due the contractor.
By the law of agency it is a general rule that a person to whom
certain powers have been given cannot delegate such powers to an-
other. This rule does not require the engineer to do all of the me-
chanical and ministerial part of his work himself, but it is well recog-
nized that such duties may be performed by others under his direc-
tion. It is not practicable for him to do all himself. There are four
exceptions to the rule:
1. When there is a lawful custom or usage to authorize it.
2. When the act is purely ministerial. By this is meant the
doing of anything by the command or at the direction of another.
3. When the object of the agency cannot be otherwise obtained.
4. When the principal is aware that his agent will delegate to
others part of his powers and duties.
All four of these exceptions may apply in case of the engineer's
agency, and he may have others to assist him. Matters of judgment
and discretion should be decided by the engineer.
THE ENGINEER AS QUASI-ARBITRATOR.
It is often provided in construction contracts that to prevent dis-
putes and litigation, the decision of the engineer as to all questions
in relation to the work and the measurements, quality, quantity, ex-
tra work, etc., shall be final, and from such decision there shall be no
appeal.
Under contracts with such provisions the engineer is clothed with
power to decide or judge between the contractor and owner. So far
he is an arbitrator and his powers, duties and liabilities under such a
clause are in a large measure distinct from his powers, duties and lia-
bilities as the agent of his employer. Here he acts in a judicial capa-
city and in his character as quasi-arbitrator, he is not liable to suit
for loss occasioned by his wrong decision unless it is shown that he has
been dishonest and fraudulent. All that is required of an arbitrator
is that he shall act honestly and be faithful in the performance of his
duties to the best of his judgment; and he is not required to bring any
particular skill to the performance of the duty.
A contractor cannot recover from him except when loss is occas-
ioned by his fraud and dishonesty. He is still liable to the owner or
his agent for loss occasioned by his lack of skill or due care. His re-
lation to his employer is dual but to the contractor it is only that of
arbitrator or quasi-arbitrator,


THE TECHNIC.
Objection has been waged against the provision commonly put
into construction contracts, making the decision of the engineer final,
because the engineer is usually employed by the owner to superintend
the work and look after the interests of his employer. He is, there-
fore, they say, not an impartial arbitrator, and one who is to thus de-
cide questions arising between the owner and contractor as in any
other case of arbitration, should be an impartial judge. On the other
hand since the contractor knows when he signs the contract that the
engineer is employed by the owner, it is not unjust that he should be
subject to the provisions of the contract. Courts have frequently
held that only such an interest as is unknown to a party to such an
agreement will bar a person from acting as arbitrator.
It has been the custom in a very few localities for the parties to
provide in the contract that a disinterested engineer should be em-
ployed. In such case his compensation is paid in equal shares by the
parties to the contract. Should this custom become general it would
certainly add much to the honorable professional character of the
engineer's practice and would leave him free to exercise his best
judgment in matters of difference between the parties, without any
influence of his personal interest to even tend to turn his decision in
favor of either party.
THE STATUTE OP FRAUDS.
All or nearly all the states have enacted what is called "The
Statute of Frauds," either as it was enacted in Great Britain or in a
modified form. Some of the provisions of this statute, which is very
much alike in the various states, may be profitably considered here.
By this statute every contract which is not to be performed within
one year from its date must be in writing and signed by the parties.
A case which may become of interest to the engineer, is an employ-
ment for one year to begin at some date subsequent to the date of
the contract. In such case if the contract be oral, it cannot be
enforced and the employer may refuse to permit the engineer to
commence work under it, and the engineer will have no right of
action.
A contract for the sale or transfer of land or any interest in
land, must be in writing. It has been held that permission to one to
erect a building or a bridge on the lands of another, or leave to occupy
land by a railroad, a dam or a canal, or to overflow land by a dam, or
to dig and remove coal, ore, gravel, etc., since it is a contract for an
interest in land must be in writing.
A contract to answer for the debt, default or misdoing of another,
must be in writing. A bond to secure the performance of a construc-
tion contract, is such a contract and if not in writing the sureties
cannot be held liable on the bond.


57
CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS.
Every contract in order to be binding must be entered into by two
parties competent under the law to make a contract. It is a funda-
mental principle of the law of contracts, that the minds of the
parties must meet and agree in order to make a contract. If a per-'
son is not of sufficient mental capacity, by reason of being an imbecile,
lunatic, idiot or confirmed drunkard, a contract made by him is not
binding because it may be proved that he is of insufficient mental
power to be capable of reasoning and forming a judgment as to what
is for his benefit. The law, therefore, guards against unfair advan-
tage being taken of such persons, as also in the case of infants, by
which term is meant persons under twenty-one, or in some states
males under twenty-one and females under eighteen years of age.
The party who is competent, is bound although the infant may avoid
it. At common law a married woman cannot make a valid contract,
but most of the states, in these modern times when women are com-
ing to the front, have enacted statutes empowering married women
to contract. If in the state where a contract is entered into and to
be executed there is no express provision of this kind, no contract
should be made with a married woman as one of the parties.
An engineer or any agent, may, if duly authorized, make a con-
tract which is binding upon his principal; but in such cases it is best
that the authority be expressly recited in the contract and it should
appear that the agent is making the contract for and in behalf of
the principal whose name should be set out in the written instrument.
In entering into contracts with public officials or officers and
agents of public corporations, every one is bound at his peril to ascer-
tain the extent of their authority, because a public corporation is
not bound unless its agents acfstrictly within the authority delegated
to them by the act of incorporation or by law.
An engineer whether a contractor himself or acting as engineer
for the contractor or for the public corporation, should thoroughly
inform himself of the extent of the authority of its officers and
agents. It is too often the case that contracts are entered into, or
subsequent changes in contracts with public corporations are made
without a due regard to the authority possessed by their officers.
Officers and agents of public corporations frequently on their own
motion order changes made which can legally be made only by an act
of the council or some other authorized body.
So in the case of other corporations. The officers or agents must
in some manner be authorized- by the board of directors, trustees or
other governing body, to enter into a contract for a proposed con-
struction work or their contracts therefor will have no binding effect.
Any one contracting with such unauthorized officers or agents, does
so at his peril, for the corporation would not be liable under such a
contract. Such corporations are also limited by their charters or by


58
THE TECHNIC.
general law and any contract entered into by a corporation for the
making of any improvement which such a corporation is not author-
ized to make by reason of the limitation of its powers and objects, is
void because it is ultra vires, or beyond the powers of such corporation.
The system of letting contracts for important works after adver-
tising for and receiving bids, which is so common in this country,
makes this subject a matter of importance to every engineer. This
is one way of arriving at an agreement and making a contract. A
bid or proposal is merely an offer to do some particular work or fur-
nish some specified materials for a stipulated compensation. If, be-
fore it is withdrawn, it is accepted by the person or corporation in-
tending to have the work done, a binding contract exists between the
parties. A certified check is usually required to be deposited with
each bid; and this is forfeited if the bidder withdraws his bid.
Public corporations are usually required to advertise for propos-
als for such public improvements as are to be made, and to award the
contract to the lowest responsible bidder. Unless the advertisement
is properly made, for the required length of time and in all respects
as required by law or the ordinance or charter of the public corpora-
tion, no valid contract can be made. Such a contract can be made
only in the manner provided by the law.
Private owners can, of course, make such rules and have such bids
submitted in such form, as they may see fit.
The terms upon which bids are to be made should, in every case,
be made clear and definite so as to show the exact terms of the con-
tract, and the subject matter of the bids should be definitely de-
scribed. To this end the plans and specifications submitted to intend-
ing bidders should be so carefully drawn as to show every item which
the bidder needs to know to prepare his proposal, and so as to have all
bids upon the same basis. Then when a bid is accepted a definite con-
tract is made and the terms thereof agreed upon: and if either party
refuses to execute the contract, he is liable in damages to the other
party.
It has been held that an order to begin work, or any conduct or
language on the part of the person intending to have the work done,
which shows that he has accepted a bid, will bind him.
When a contract is reduced to writing and signed by the parties,
it is supposed to contain the whole of the contract and no evidence of
what was said before or at the time of making the contract, will be
received to contradict or vary its terms. The written contract is
taken to contain the final deliberate understanding of the parties.
This rule does not prevent the admission of evidence to explain tech-
nical terms, or to explain any apparent inconsistencies, either be-
tween the different parts of the contract, or between the contract
and the plans and specifications.
Although the written contract is taken as the complete expres-
sion of the agreement, the law does not prevent two separate con-


59
tracts being entered into at the same time. Both of such contracts
may be written cr both oral, or one written and the other oral. It
must be borne in mind, however, that each separate contract must
have its separate and independent consideration. Subsequently to
making a contract a written or an oral agreement may be made either
modifying or superseding the original contract, if there is a new con-
sideration. The consideration to support such subsequent modifica-
tion may be the mutual relinquishment of some rights under the pre-
vious contract. It is not necessary that the consideration be money.
One may agree to do a piece of work in a different manner in consid-
eration of the owner relinquishing his right to have it done in the
manner provided in the original contract.
If a contract is executory, that is, has not yet been performed, it
may be rescinded by mutual consent; but if it has been executed by
one of the parties, the condition of mutuality does not exist and it
cannot be rescinded without a consideration.
If the original contract is required by the statute of frauds to be
in writing, the modification must also be in writing. Thus it is re-
quired that any contract not to be executed within one year from the
date upon which it is made, or any contract relating to the sale of
real estate, must be in writing and subsequent modification must also
be in writing.
Care should be taken to make the contract complete, including in
it and the specifications, which should be made a part of it, in definite
terms, the whole of the agreement between the parties. It is also
best even to provide for contingencies liable to happen during the
progress of the work. The plans and specifications are to be consid-
ered a part of the contract and should in every case be made a part
of the written contract by some express language which wiil identify
the particular plans and specifications intended. The plans and speci-
fications should be attached to the contract although this is not abso-
lutely necessary. A memorandum written on the back of them and
signed by the parties to the contract, is sufficient to make them a
part of the contract.
EXTRAS AND ALTERATIONS
A large part of the litigation which arises between owners and
contractors out of construction contracts, is over the question of
extras. Some contractors place their main dependence for profits in
getting good prices for extras and therefore are willing to have as
many extras as possible in the work they undertake. What are
extras? is therefore an important question and not always easy to
answer. It may be stated as one rule governing the question of
extras that any work or material will be presumed to have been done
or furnished under the contract unless it can be determined that the
contrary is true. But if the work was done in compliance with the


THE TECHNIC.
request of the owner and was not required by the contract the con-
tractor may recover for it as an extra.
The circumstances which may determine the question are so vari-
ous that it is impossible to discuss them at length in the short compass
of this article. The authority of the engineer is not usually such
that he may order extra work done and bind his principal, and the
contractor who does such work at the request of the engineer or
other person employed to superintend the work, cannot recover.
This is especially true as to work done for a city or other public
corporation, merely at the request of the engineer or other agent
employed by such corporation. Express authority must have been
given or no liability of the owner exists for such work, and the owner
may refuse to pay for it. The conduct or language of the owner,
after gaining knowledge of such work being done, may, however, be
such as to work a ratification of the acts of his agent and he will
then be bound.
Many have wisely inserted into construction contracts a provis-
ion to govern the allowance and payment for extras. It is common
to provide that no extras will be paid for unless the order for the
work shall be in writing and the price for the work agreed upon and
endorsed upon the original contract. Under such a contract no com
pensation can be recovered for extra work unless such formalities
have been complied with. Even such a contract may, however, be
modified by subsequent oral agreements, or the assent of the owner
to a lax observance of the contract and permitting extra work to be
done and paying for it may work a waiver of such provisions and a
modification of the contract so that the owner may become liable for
the payment of large amounts for extra work done without such
order and formalities. The only safe way is to constantly insist upon
a strict observance of the contract. This provision will serve as an
illustration. Others might be cited.
One other clause is an express waiver of all claims for extras:
but it has been doubted by many whether it is wise to insert such a
provision. It tends to cause contractors to demand higher prices for
work as a kind of insurance against loss by reason of extra work
made necessary by unforseen circumstances.
In making any changes in plans or in the contract, care should be
taken to acquaint the sureties on the contractor's bond with the facts
and secure their consent, because they are released if changes be
made without their consent. If a person has signed a bond for the
faithful performance of a contract, his suretyship extends only to
the original contract. If the contract contains a provision for
changes in the plans and specifications and the contractor has agreed
in the contract to make any alterations which the owner may require,
the surety is not released because modifications are made, such
changes being contemplated and provided for in the contract, the
performance of which he has guaranteed.


61
If the contract provides for withholding part of the payment
until completion, payment in full before completion will release the
surety. The surety is released if it becomes impossible to perform
the contract without fault of the contractor. As for instance if the
thing to be delivered has been destroyed or has died, and cannot be
replaced, the sureties are released.

REVOLVING CHUCK.
ELMER H. NEPF, '90.
The accompanying cut illustrates a special chuck, designed by
the writer, for use in the Screw Machine Department of the Brown
&amp; Sharpe Manufacturing Co. This tool is designed for holding for
second operations ball nuts, clamp studs, lever screws, or any similar
work where it is desired to perform operations on more than one side
of the piece at one chucking. These ball nuts are drilled through
the ball, faced on two sides of the hole, and the end hole drilled and
tapped; the fourth side could be operated upon if necessary.
This tool consists of a face plate 11 A," a chuck body " B," a cyl-
inder "C" which can be rotated, so as to present any one of four


THE TECHNIC.
openings which may be desired, and the means provided for holding
and operating the chuck jaws. The face plate is threaded to fit the
nose df the spindle of our No. 4 Screw Machine on which the chuck
is to be used. It is held to the chuck body by three radial screws at
angles of 120% and by four horizontal clamp screws. The radial
screws are tapped iuto the face plate, and have their heads over-
lapping the edge of the chuck body. These are for the purpose of
centering the chuck, as it is usually found for accurate work, that
such a chuck has to be lined up when it is put on any particular
machine, even if it had been previously, carefully lined up on some
other machine. The horizontal screws are used to clamp the chuck
to plate after adjustment are made with the radial screws. The cyl-
inder " A" which holds the chuck jaws, is accurately indexed through
90% and drilled and hardened steel bushings inserted for the locking
pin shown. This locking pin is operated by means of a rack and pin-
ion movement, a rack having been cut on the upper side of the
locking pin. The pinion is rotated by means of lever shown, and is
held in place by a tit screw, having the tit let into a slot in the
pinion.
Referring to the vertical section, one pair of chuck jaws "D"
"D" for holding a ball nut are shown in position, the one at the left
being fixed as regards cross-wise movement after having been once
set in the proper position by the nut " E" shown just behind the body
to which the jaw is fastened. The one at the right is moved cross-
wise for clamping and releasing, by rotating the bronze nut "F" with
a suitable wrench. The large nut "G" at the left enables perfect
adjustment for taking up all lost motion of the cylinder cross-wise,
and is held in position by set screw, and brass clamp plug "H."' At
the right hand end, the bronze nut shown, is held in a cap "J," which
is in turn held in the cylinder " A" by an arrangement similar to
method of holding a gun-breech by an interrupted thread: i. e., the
cylindrical wing on the cap is cut away in four places, which will pass
through four openings in the cylinder " A," and when rotated 45% the
two coincide. They are then held in that position by the screw plug
shown. The methods of oiling are quite obvious. This tool has
proven very etlicient and satisfactory in accomplishing the purpose
for which it was designed.

LEVELING IN CONNECTION WITH THE DETROIT WATER
WORKS.
C. W. HUBBELL, '93.
The distribution system of the Detroit Water Works represents
an expenditure of nearly three millions of dollars, and consists of
about five hundred and thirty miles of cast-iron pipes ranging in size
from forty-two to three inches inside diameter, seventy per cent, be-
ingsix inches and over. In 1893 the hydraulic efficiency of this sys-
tem was so unsatisfactory that its care was placed in the hands of an
engineering department in charge of Gardner S. Williams, class of
'88. Since that time a careful investigation of hydraulic conditions
and phenomena has been instituted, and a systematic record kept
covering those conditions in all parts of the system in such a way as
to make possible an intelligent and effective direction of recent im-
provements and extensions.
One valuable source of information has been made available
largely through the courtesy and co-operation of the Detroit Fire De-
partment. Gauges have been placed in various engine houses which
are read once an hour by the firemen on duty, and a record kept on
planks furnished for that purpose. A continuous record is thus ob-
tained of the available pressure throughout the system, which affords
an opportunity to study the local requirements of supply and demand
at all times and under all conditions. By comparing the hourly re-
cord of pressure at each gauge station with the initial pressure at the
pumping works, the loss of head due to elevation and friction is ob-
tained for each separate district represented. Then by comparing
district with district the weak points in the system are ferreted out,
and may be strengthened either by laying larger pipes or by closing
gates in such a manner as to equalize the How and in that way relieve
the over-taxed member of the system. There are now twenty-live of
these gauge stations in service.
The initial pressure maintained at the pumps is expended in three
ways:
1. Pressure required to overcome elevation.
2. Pressure required to overcome flriction in pipes.
3. Pressure available for use.
The pressure available for use is represented by the direct gauge
reading at each station; that required to overcome friction in pipes
is a function of the velocity and varies for each station from hour to
hour, depending on the local consumption. In cold weather it may be
a maximum at night when taps are left running to prevent freezing.
This is especially apt to be the case in residence districts. In hot
summer weather a maximum is reached in the afternoon, when large
quantities of water are used for lawn sprinkling and cooling purposes,


THE TECHNIC.
The first item is a constant due to elevation, and its measure between
any two points is the difference of elevation between those points.
In order to determine this constant the elevation of each gauge must
be known, and it is the purpose of this paper to describe more par-
ticularly the work of connecting gauge stations by means of intersect-
ing lines of closed levels. For while there is a goodly amount of lit-
erature on levels and leveling, it for the most part describes long lines
of what is termed precise leveling and does not apply to work of the
nature hereinafter described.
The levels required aggregate about eighty miles and consist of a
number of intersecting loops, each loop closing either on the place of
beginning or on some point of known elevation. A net work of inter-
secting lines is thus obtained which offers a favorable opportunity to
observe the accuracy attainable in short lines of closed levels, and
although sixty miles is not enough upon which to base conclusions, at
least a clue may be found as to the factor of precision to be reason-
ably expected under similar conditions.
The City of Detroit is situated on gently sloping ground which
rises gradually as it recedes from the Detroit River. The grade is
about twenty feet per mile until an elevation of perhaps sixty feet
above the river is reached, after which the ground is nearly level.
Nearly all the lines of levels follow paved streets upon which there is
considerable traffic. It was frequently necessary to set the level on
the pavement itself, thus subjecting it to more or less jar from pass-
ing teams. Some difficulty was experienced on account of the dust
especially on lines run in dry, windy, summer weather. Part of the
lines were run during cold weather when keeping notes was unpleas-
ant and when great care had to be exercised to prevent the trijHxl
shoes from settling in the ice or frozen ground. The same level and
rod were used for the entire work; the levelman and rodman were,
however, changed from time to time thereby eliminating to a large
extent the equation of personal error. Backsights and foresights
were kept as nearly equal as possible by pacing and were usually
about three hundred feet each. During the heat of the day sights
were sometimes reduced to two hundred feet and if the air boiled too
much, work was stopped for two hours or more during the worst part
of the day. Each levelman received instructions to do his very best
work. A party consisted of a levelman at a cost of say $5.00 per hay.
and the average speed was 1.8 miles per day: cost per mile $2.80.
Instruments. The rod used is of the kind known as an architect's
rod made of two pieces of hard maple i-inch square, reading 5.300
feet when closed and 10.000 feet when extended. It is graduated like
a N. Y. Rod and furnished with vernier reading to one-thousandth- of
a foot. The target is 3+ inches in diameter and quartered red :ind
white. In September, 181)7, the target was improved by pasting a
piece of paper over its face and painting it all black with the exc?p-
tion of a horizontal shouldered slot 0.010 of a foot wide at the outside


edge of the target and 0.005 of a foot wide at the center. Before
changing it was difficult to detect an error in setting of 0.002 of a
foot on a sight 300 feet long, but with the slot it would be detected
every time, even in poor weather, and did not seem to tax the eyes so
severely.
Buff &amp; Berger's Wye level No. 2006, 18-inch, erecting telescope
was used for this work. The bubble scale is divided into inches and
tenths, the angular value of one division was determined April 27,
1898, under the following condition:
Temperature about 60° Fahr. Base 300 feet long measured with
steel tape. Level set up in shade of Hurlbut gateway. Rod held in

THE TECHNIC.
Attention is called to the fact that one division on the bubble
scale corresponds to 0.016 of a foot on the rod when placed 300 feet
distant from which it follows that if the center of the bubble is j5-5 of an
inch either way from the center of the scale when a reading is taken,
an error will be introduced of about one and one-half thousandths of
a foot. As ,ij of an inch is pretty close work, especially where it has
to be determined by estimating by eye the tenth of a division on the
scale for each end of the bubble, it seems likely that an error of 0.002
of a foot from this source would not be unusual.
One-tenth of an inch on the bubble scale should have an angular
value of from eight to ten seconds of arc in order to correspond
to the factor of precision with which it is possible to set the target
at 300 feet distance.
The following table gives the distance in miles and the closing
error in feet for fifteen closed loops. The three lines showing the
greatest discrepancies were run under conditions more unfavorable
than usual, as noted on margin.

tablished on the Hurlbut gate at the entrance to the pumping works
grounds and make the elevation of the latter 104.478 ± 0.010 feet city
datum. The maximum closing error as will be noticed in the table is
only 0.047 for the line showing the most closure. This result is checked
in an unexpected manner by live lines of levels run in 1895 in connec-


tion with the laying of a line of 42 inch pipe between a bench mark
at the corner of Chene and Champlain streets and a bench mark on
the stone coping of the fence near the Hurlbut gate, a distance of 2.6
miles, these levels were carelessly run and are not considered accur-
ate, no special pains having been taken to do good work, in fact part
of them were run with a rod which could be read to hundredths only.
Both ends of these levels were afterwards tied with accurate levels,
the probable error being only ± 0.003 of a foot. Making the proper
transfer, the elevation of the Hurlbut gate B. M. is a follows:

The mean value, 104.476 ± 0.151, obtained by this series varies
only 0.002 of a foot from the value obtained by the six accurate deter-
minations given in table No. 1. This close agreement of results is a
surprise and would not be expected from an examination of the clos-
ing errors, from which it is seen that the mean value depends on one
very bad closing error of nearly a foot, the only negative result in the
entire series, and one which on mere inspection would probably be
thrown out altogether. Line No. 11, which shows the least closing
error of any in the table, when checked at about the middle of the
loop shows an error of 0.017, while the closing error is only 0.001 of a
foot, from which it is seen that it is not always safe to assume that
the error of a bench mark established lies within the closing error of
the circuit upon which it is located.
All elevations and Bench Marks established are referred to the
U. S. B. M. on the light-house building at the foot of Mt. Elliott Ave.,
established by the United States Engineer Corps' Survey of the Great
Lake Region between the years of 1871 and 1877, its elevation being
104.48 city datum and 584.78 ± 0.35 above mean tide in New York har-
bor. The plane to which the elevation above mean tide is referred is
that adopted by the Lake Survey and corresponds to an elevation of
14.73 above mean tide at New York for the Bench Mark on the grist-
mill at Greenbush, New York, as established by the Coast Survey in
1877. In 1894-5 Mr. C. H. Van Orden made a second determination of
"Gristmill" Bench which lowered its elevation a little over a foot.
Jf the later elevation proves correct, and there is some evidence that

thirty-four lines of levels ranging from seventeen to one hundred and

The accuracy with which elevations are determined is greater
than that attained in reading gauges. An inexperienced observer
will seldom read the vibrating pointer of a gauge closer than a quar-
ter of a pound (= 0.58 feet) and a half pound error is not infrequent.
An average of twenty-four hours would therefore be liable to an error
of one-tenth of a foot or more, while the probable error of elevations
in no case exceeds ±0.04 and is seldom greater than ±0.02 of a foot.
From time to time, however, special tests are made with more accur-
ate instruments and experienced observers, in which the degree of
accuracy attained is not far from that with which the elevations are
determined.
Results.—In conclusion a few words as to general results obtained
may not be out of place. The f rictional loss in the system as a whole
has been decreased about 45% or 50%. This means simply, that the
pressure required to push a given amount of water through the pipes
of the distribution system is now only about one-half what it was in
1893. This saving in pressure is particularly significant in view of the
fact that the pumping engines, while capable of delivering consider-
ably more water than has yet been required of them,— had in 1893
very nearly reached the limit of allowable pressure for which they
were constructed. The cost of readjusting the system has been about
$325,000, which is partially offset by a saving of 121% in fuel bills.
In 1896 the fuel bill was $31,186.17, burning oil. In 1897 it was $17,-
355.58, burning soft coal. The saving in 1896 at 12*% would be $3897.-
77 and in 1897, $2,169.44. A low estimate of the average saving may
be placed at $2,400 per annum. This capitalized at 3% represents an
investment of $80,000.00, and leaves the net cost of improvements say
$240,000 in five years, an average of $49,000 per year. This showing
compares very favorably with expenditures in previous years, which
however did not accomplish the desired results.
The most important benefit derived in the equalization of press-
ures so that up-town residence districts which formerly had from
eight to ten pounds pressure now have from fourteen to sixteen
pounds without increasing the initial pressure at the pumps. In these
districts, buildings, which in 1893 had water on the first floor only, are
now enabled to place both tubs and fixtures on the second floor, and at
the same time feel secure in knowing that there is a sufficient supply
of water available for fire protection.


THE TECHNIC.
RESULTS OF EFFICIENCY TESTS ON THE ENGLEWOOD
AND CHICAGO ELECTRIC STORAGE BATTERY ROAD.
GEORGE A. DAMON, B. S. '95.
One of the marked features of electrical progress in this country
during1 the past two years has been the rapid advancement of the
storage battery. Nearly three million dollars worth of accumulators
are being used today in isolated plants, in central power plants, or in
substations, and the advantage gained by their use are now well
recognized. As the Technic goes to press this year the largest bat-
tery ever made, consisting of 332 cells, each of 11,000 ampere hour
capacity, is being thrown across the mains of the Chicago Edison Co.,
and the successful inauguration of this immense battery coincides
very nearly with the first anniversary of Chicago's storage battery
road, which for about a year has been attracting widespread atten-
tion. This road, which is the largest of its kind in the world and the
only one in this country is now operating twenty motor cars over
twenty-four miles of track in the suburbs of Chicago. It is not the
intention of this article to describe the equipment of this installa-
tion as detailed descriptions have appeared in a number of the
technical papers.*
In the fall of 1897 it was decided by Mr. G. Herbert Condict, then
general manager, to make a test of the road and its model power
plant to determine the most economical methods of operation. The
tests were put in charge of the writer with no further instructions
than to make them complete. Through the kindness of Prof. T. P.
Gaylord, whom many Technic readers will recall as a member of the
Class of '93, the equipment of the Armour Institute of Technology
was made available, while the students of that institution assisted
during the entire test which lasted over a month.
The report of the tests has been abstracted quite generally by the
technical press t and has also been published in part by The Electric
Storage Battery Co., of Philadelphia, in a pamphlet issued March 1,
1898, and which may be had for the asking. It is not the intention to
republish these results at this time, but rather to call attention to
some of the interesting engineering conclusions which may be reached
by a study of the data collected during the tests. For this purpose
the graphical log of the observations as shown in Figures 1, 2, 3, 4
and 5 will be of value. It will also be necessary to state that the
equipment of the power plant consists of two 250 horse power triple

same way as in the University plant with the exception that in this
case four generators are installed between the engines instead of
two, in such a way that either engine can operate any one or all four
of the dynamos.
Lack of space will not permit giving a complete description of
the scheme of the tests nor of the precautions adopted to secure
accurate observations on the coal and water consumed, as well as on
the output of the engines and generators.
All scales, steam gauges, thermometers, indicator springs, electri-
cal and other instruments used were either the standard apparatus of
the Armour Institute, or were carefully calibrated. Eight indicators
were required to obtain the horse power of each engine.
The first test was with the plant running with two boilers, two


THE TECHNIC.
engines and three generators. The second test was with practically
the same load carried by one boiler, one engine and two generators,
while the last test was made under practically the same conditions as
the second test, with the exception that the three voltage method of
charging the batteries was abandoned. In this test but one genera-
tor was used, and the batteries were charged in successive sets, all at
a common potential, the voltage being raised, as the batteries became
charged, in such a way that the load upon the generator was kept
nearly constant.
The coal used was from Pairmount, W. Va., and cost, delivered at
the power house, $1.90 per ton. An average of five determinations
of its calorific value by the Berthier method gave 10,145 British Ther-
mal units per pound.
The general results of the tests are given in table No. 1.

We are now in a position to take up the question of the influence
of the action of the different parts of the station equipment upon


71!
the total plant efficiency. Take, for instance, the economizer which
utilizes the latent heat of the waste flue gases. The percentage of
gain (fuel saved) due to rise in the temperature of the feed water
secured by the use of the economizer may be calculated as follows:
Let H = Total heat units in steam at boiler pressure reckoned
from 0 degrees F. (Taken from steam tables).
T = Temperature of feed water after heating.
t = temperature of feed water before heating. Then

this formula was 7.4% and in the second test the result was 6.9%. It

has been shown by numerous evaporative tests, that the actual saving
due to an economizer is ordinarily about 30% greater than calculated
by the above theoretical formula, so we are more than safe in taking
the saving due to the economizer in this plant at 7%. During the
third test the economizer was not used and it is instructive to notice
the loss in this case between the heater and the boiler, which amounted
to about 1%. With a coal bill of $7,000 per year it will be seen that
at 7% the economizer saves $520 per year. In this case the econo-
mizer and extra flues required cost $3,000 or about $5 per boiler horse

power. The saving effected, then, represents an interest of 17.4% upon
the investment which is enough above the Usual allowance for inter-
est and depreciation, to justify the purchase. It may be said that
the economizer in this plant is not installed or operated to the best
advantage and that in general the actual saving which may be
effected by the use of this device will be about 10%. If in conjunc-
tion with the economizer a mechanical draft had been adopted for
this plant a part of the 15% of the heat units in the coal which
escaped in the flue gases passing up the chimney and which were
necessary to produce the draft would have been saved and the total
station efficiency would have been proportionately increased.
The top curve on Fig. 1, which shows the observations made upon
Fig i Boiler Test No. i.
the temperature of the feed water during the lirst test shows two
points worth noting. The gradual rise in the beginning of the curve
represents what might be called the "time lag " of the economizer,
while the rise during the latter part of the test was due directly to the
influence of a pipe covering which was at that time placed about the
feed water pipes leading to and from the economizer. The average
gain in the feed water temperature due to the covering ma3r be taken
as ten degrees and if we apply our formula as before we find a


75
resultant gain of 1 %. Based on a coal bill of $7,000 per year this rep-
resents a saving of about $70 per year. The actual cost of the pipe
covering in place was $64, thus showing a very good investment and it
will be of value to note that this was upon the feed water line.
The pumps in the last test used 14.30 % "of the water evaporated
by the boilers. The feed water, however, was heated by the exhai»t
steam, from a temperature of 97.4 degrees P. to a temperature of 202

only 14.36 % — 9.25 % or 5.11 % of the total fuel burned. It was de-
termined that the pumps developed an indicated horse power hour
on 67.5 pounds of water, but if they return to the system the heat
units shown, they are equivalent to pumps returning nothing to the
system using ^'^^433^'^ or 24 pounds of water per indicated horse
power hour in the steam cylinder. This means that if the pumps were
driven directly from the main engine shaft they might have been
operated on a duty of 18 pounds of water per horse power hour instead
of at an equivalent of 24 pounds and thus a slight improvement in
plant efficiency might have been effected, If instead of driving the


THE TECHNIC.
pumps directly from the engine shaft an electric motor had been
used, then there would have been introduced between the main engine
cylinder and the pump cylinder the transmission losses due to the en-
gine, to the generator, and to the motor. The efficiency between the
indicated horse power of the engine and the delivered output of the
generator in the last test was found to average 80%. If the efficiency
of the motor be taken at the same figure we find a transmission loss of
18 X 100
36% and our pumps, if electrically driven would require
or 28 pounds of water per horse power delivered to the pump cylinder.

If we allow with our independent steam driven pump an efficiency of
85% between steam and water cylinders, our "equivalent" of 24
pounds per I. H. F. becomes 28 pounds per horse power hour delivered to
the pump cylinder. The conclusion is that in a condensing plant with
moderately efficient pumps using the latent heat of their exhaust to
heat the feed water, but little economy, if any, can be gained by
changing to the use of electrically driven auxiliaries.
The heat balance of the entire plant as worked out from all the
data collected on the last test is shown in Table No. 2, and it will be

It will be instructive to compare the efficiency of other stations
with the result of 5.58% obtained in the one tested. At first glance
the efficiency of this plant may appear low, but it will actually be
found to be comparatively high, and this is one of the direct results
of the high "load factor." The relatively high ratio which can be
maintained between the average load and the maximum load in the
power station of an accumulator traction power station is one of the
chief points which can be advanced in favor of this system, and the
practical value of the argument is shown very nicely both by the load
Curves and the high plant efficiency. The tests further illustrate the


THE TECHNIC.
importance of keeping all the units in operation working, as nearly
as possible, at their full rated capacity. This idea was demonstrated
so thoroughly that the "three voltage " method of charging the bat-
teries was abandoned during the use of a nine car schedule, and dur-
ing the winter the plant has been run as operated in the third test.
In the summer time, however, when the traffic is much heavier and
two engines will be required to handle the load the original method of
charging the batteries will again be adopted.

operation is at hand and would make a valuable addition to the dis-
cussion as to whether or not it pays to install a "dry land " condensing
plant, but lack of space will not allow its publication at this time. In
this connection it may be stated that during the winter months the
car barns and battery charging rooms are heated by means of the dis-
charge water from the condensers, thus heating this large amount
of space for practically nothing, and at the same time doing away
with the use of the cooling tower.
The results of the first year's operation of this unique installation
have been awaited by engineers with much interest. This road is the
first one in this country to be fully equipped throughout for the pur-
pose of operating storage battery cars exclusively. It may be said


79
that its success has been much greater than the most sanguine expec-
tations of its promoters, and is such that even the most skeptical
must be convinced of the success of accumulator traction. Dur-
ing the hard winter, just passed, the reliability of the service has
been even better than that upon parallel trolley systems, while dur-
ing the summer the carrying capacity of the cars are frequently over-
taxed and thus the earning capacity of the road has been demon-
strated.
The most surprising development of the whole scheme, however,
has been the remarkable durability of the battery plates. During the
year, just closing, forty-four batteries have traveled over 800,000 miles,
*I60 100 i
Time

and the only expense for maintenance has been for the small amount
of labor required to occasionally clean the plates. Even if a large
outlay were to be required at the end of the year to replace the posi-
tive plates the cost of maintenance would fall within a reasonable
figure. As it is the batteries appear to be in the best of condition,
and will apparently last many months, thus demonstrating the com-
mercial utility of the system.
In regard to the commercial efficiency of the entire system it may
be noted that it compares favorably with that of trolley roads oper-
ating under similar conditions. The cost for fuel of less than one
cent per car mile falls well within what is considered good street rail-


THE TECHNIC.
way practice. The disadvantage of the apparently excessive loss be-
tween the switch board and the motor axle is balanced by the
advantages that accrue from being able to operate the power station
at a constant and efficient load for a shorter time each day than that
during which the cars are running. As a whole, the operation of this
road must be taken as a demonstration of the applicability of accumu-
lator traction to street and suburban railway service.
STRENGTH OF WROUGHT IRON AT LOW AND HIGH TEM-
PERATURES.
R. C. CARPENTER, '75.
Wrought iron and steel are frequently employed by mechanical
engineers in locations or positions where the temperature varies a
great amount from the normal, thus for the construction of steam
boilers, wrought iron or steel is employed in positions where the tem-
perature must certainly exceed that due to the pressure of the steam
used and often reaches a temperature of from .100 to 500 degrees: in
steam pipes and engines the temperature is essentially the same as
that of the steam, though perhaps somewhat lower. The heating up
of journals caused by lack of proper lubrication sometimes causes a
very high temperature, and such conditions are not uncommon in
respect to car axles or line shafting. On the other hand there has
been an extensive use of material in refrigerating machines during
the last few years, portions of which are subjected to extreme cold.
These examples are sufficient to emphasize the fact that metals are
frequently employed under such conditions of use as to be subjected
to temperatures essentially different and either higher or lower than
that of the air found in inhabitable locations: it is then a matter of
practical importance to ascertain whether or not extreme tempera-
ture conditions have any material effect on the strength of such
materials as would ordinarily be employed.
The results of the investigation which will be described in the
latter portion of this paper indicate that the temperature has an
important effect on the strength of the material, and that in regards
to most materials, i. e., either wrought iron or steel, the strength is
practically a minimum at about 70 degrees Fahrenheit and increases
as the temperature is changed in either direction, and becoming
about 20 per cent, stronger at temperatures of about 500 degrees
Fahrenheit on the one hand and 60 degrees below zero on the other.
The law of increase of strength is shown graphically in diagram 4
accompanying this article. By consulting this it will be noted that
the increase in strength is gradual but well marked as the tempera-
ture changes in either direction.


81
Besides the strength of metals an important consideration is that
relating to their toughness or power to resist shock; this property is
indicated in tension tests by the amount of elongation found within
the elastic limit and up to the point of rupture. A study of this
property indicates that the lowering of the temperature from
70 degrees to that of 60 below has little or no sensible effect on the
ductility of the metal but that a considerable change is experienced
by increasing the temperature. Our investigations of the strength of
metals at high temperatures indicate a brittle region at the tempera-
ture of steam at 5 to 10 pounds pressure, and this same property has
also been noted by a German investigator, from which it would seem
that although the strength is increased the metal has less power to
resist the effects of shocks at the ordinary temperature of steam
than when at the usual temperature of the air.
CRYSTALLIZATION NOT COVERED BY CHANGE OP TEMPERATURE.
The subject of the cause of the crystallization of iron has been
investigated so far as lay within our power by numerous experiments
in the Sibley College laboratories, the attempt being made to pro-
duce crystallization by some method of applying stress. This subject
does not properly come under1 the title of the present article, except
so far as the effect of heat and cold in producing this phenomena was
employed. The method of making these tests will be briefly stated
to have consisted in the rupture of similar materials first by falling
weights moving with greater or less rapidity, then by shocks caused
by the explosion of gun powder and dynamite, then by breaking with
blows after a repeated number of heatings and coolings and finally
the application of a great number of blows of small intensity.
The general results of these investigations indicated that the
statement which is made in nearly every text-book, relating to the
strength of materials and even in some of the recent books on this
subject, that crystallization could be produced by a rapidly applied
blow was entirely erroneous; on the contrary the elongation was
found to increase with the velocity of the blow; thus with the appli-
cation of a static load a certain elongation was produced, by ruptur-
ing with a blow the elongation was increased, by rupturing with
gun powder the elongation was still greater and with dynamite it was
even greater yet. The effect of applying rapid blows or of rupturing
with great rapidity had in no case the tendency to produce crystalline
fracture. The effect of breaking after a large number of repeated
heatings and coolings has been stated by some authorities to produce
a crystalline fracture; but the results of a large number of experi-
ments did not, however in any case show that such was the fact and
the conclusion which the writer drew from these experiments were
that crystallization was not caused by conditions due to changing tem-
perature. It is admitted that the only evidence respecting this point
is of a negative character, but it is believed that the experiments


THE TECHNIC.
covered more alterations of heat and cold than would be found in any
practical case. The experiments in the line of a great number of
blows of light intensity were more promising, ^.nd several cases of
distinctly crystalline fracture were produced.
These experiments together with the fact that breaks showing
crystalline fracture are almost invariably found where material is
used in such manner as to be subjected to repeated shocks of small in-
tensity, has led the writer to believe that crystalline fracture may be
and is produced in material which is originally fibrous and of excellent
quality by a repeated number of blows or shocks, any of which are of
small intensity, but are repeated with great frequency. The effect
of these blows or shocks being to cause a new arrangement of the
molecules which constitute the fibers into a crystalline form and hence
into such a position as to possess little tenacity or coherence.
This view is strengthened from the fact that nearly all the breaks
which occur in lines or coupling pins used by railroads are distinctly
crystalline and the rupture occurs without any reduction in the sec-
tion of the metal or any elongation of the original material. In the
service which causes these breaks there is an application of a repeated
number of shocks of small intensity.
Some writers have contended that crystalline fracture was only
found in material which was originally of bad quality and that the
crystalline structure always existed in the material; this view the
writer is certain is incorrect as he had experience with a machine in
which repeated crystalline breaks occurred and these could not be
prevented by the use of the very best quality of material, and mater-
ial which was known to have been free from defects of any character.
In connection with crystalline breaks it will usually be found that
the area affected by the crystalline action is at one section only of the
material, and that all other portions of the material are perfectly
fibrous and of essentially excellent quality. This naturally can be ac-
counted for by the theory that the change in molecular arrangement
is caused by vibration of the particles which would be maximum at a
certain position or cross section of the material and would affect it in
no other place.
With this preliminary and introductory statement, we will now
consider the methods of experimenting and the results obtained when
the test specimens were affected by temperatures essentially differ-
ent from those under ordinary conditions.
During the past year a number of tests were made in the labora-
tories of Sibley College by the writer with assistance of R. E. Chand-
ler, M. E., and L. L. Brinsmade, B. S., both graduate students, on the
tensile strength of wrought iron at low temperatures.
The specimens selected were from uniform stock and were all
turned to the size shown in the annexed sketch, Pig. 1. The test was
made on an Emery testing machine of the horizontal type built by
William Sellers &amp; Co. The test pieces after being placed in position


83
were surrounded by a freezing mixture which was placed in a box
fitted around the specimens, the box being several inches longer than
the reduced portion of the specimen. Several clamps were attached
to the specimen well within the box containing the freezing mixture,

and of such a form that the ends extended outside the specimen and
gave an opportunity for measuring the extension with micrometer
screws which were arranged parallel and equi-distance from the cen-
ter of the specimen. The form of the box and clamps are shown in
Fig. 2.
Considerable difficulty was found in obtaining a suitable freezing
mixture. The first attempt was made to secure low temperature by
means of the expansion of compressed air in some fluid that would
not freeze, as for instance brine for the higher temperature and
alcohol for the lower, but because of the lack of a suitable motor for
transforming the heat of the air into work, but little reduction in
temperature was secured by this method, and other means had to be
employed.
It was found after considerable experiment that by surrounding
the specimen with alcohol and by spraying liquid carbonic acid into
this that it was possible to hold and maintain a temperature at any
desired point as low as 70 degrees Fahrenheit below zero at pleasure.
Tests were made showing the strength of the specimen within a
range of temperature of 70 above to about 70 degrees below on the
Fahr. scale.
The increase in strength due to diminution of temperature was
frequently sufficient to cause the specimen to break in the larger
cross-section near the ends of the specimen which was necessarily
exposed at the temperature of the room. To overcome this tendency
to break in the larger cross-section it was found necessary to reduce
the area of cross-section near the center specimen more than origin-
ally intended.
The general results show first a decided increase in strength


THE TECHNIC.
accompanied by a corresponding rise in the strength at elastic limit
as the temperature is lowered, which is not, however, quite so well
marked. The percentage of elongation remains essentially constant
and so does the modulus of elasticity at all temperatures from 70 F. to
60 below zero, or within the range of the test. The following tables
and diagrams give the results of the test and show the variation in
strength due to change of temperature.*
Some previous tests, the results of which are also appended, were
made on wrought iron and steel at high temperatures which show a
decided increase in strength as the temperature increases from 70 to
about 500 degrees Fahr., after which the strength rapidly decreases.
A combination of these experiments would serve to show that the
strength of wrought iron increases with the change in temperature
from about 70 degrees Fahr. in either direction and that the increase
is well marked, and of considerable amount, and is characteristic of
all specimens.

The tests of wrought iron at low temperatures seem to indicate
that iron is not only stronger than at ordinary temperatures, but
that it is equally ductile and hence under no circumstances more
likely to be broken by suddenly applied shocks or blows. From the
fact that iron railroad rails break more frequently at low tempera-
tures than at high, it was formerly believed that iron at low tempera-
tures was more brittle; this phenomena is probably to be explained,
however, not by the increase of brittleness on the part of the iron,
but by the increase in the severity of the shock caused by the rolling
stock and wheels of the train impinging on the metal when in con-
tact with the frozen ground. The latter condition is doubtless a
favorable one to produce crystallization and it is quite reasonable to
suppose that the increased number of breaks in extremely cold
weather is due, not to increased brittleness of the metal, but to cvy^ •
tallization produced by a great number of severe blows.

Fahr. as abscissa. On the same diagram is drawn a curve which
shows the strength at the elastic limit with decrease in temperature.
This latter curve is not perfectly regular, but neglecting a single obser-
vation the results of all the test show a sensible rise in the elastic
limit with decrease of tem-
perature. The position of
the elastic limit as shown in
this diagram was obtained
by carefully plotting all the
observations and taking the
position of the elastic limit
as the point at which the
deformations ceased to be
proportional to the stresses.
Diagram 2 is interesting
since it shows the relation of
yield-point or what is fre-
quently termed the com-
mercial elastic limit to the
load. In this case the yield
point is defined as the point
at which the first permanent
set becomes visible due to
settling of the scale beam.
By comparing the two curves
it will be noted that this
latter quantity is somewhat
above the true elastic limit,
but the same law of increase
of strength with reference to decrease of temperature applies.
Diagram 3, shows the curve of increase in strength plotted with
reference to the strength at 70° F. as 100.

Diagram 4, is a combined diagram showing the results of the tests
made both at low and at high temperatures. In constructing this
diagram in order to make it continuous the strengths of both series
of tests were equalized at 70 degrees. This is an arbitrary assumption
which may not be quite true, but its effect on the result would only
be to raise the curve of
strength for the higher
temperatures slightly
above the position shown.
The test for the ma-
terials at high tempera-
tures was made some
years previously to that
of the test with low
materials and the nature
of the stock used in the
different tests seems to
have been somewhat dif-
ferent,since the material
tested at high tempera-
tures was a few per cent
stronger.
The stock used in
both series of tests was
as nearly uniform as
possible and the uni-
formity of the results

claimed that the investigation is complete since it would be extremely
interesting to test other materials under the same condition and also
to determine the effect of varying the composition.

Following the curves of this series of tests are given the results
of tests of wrought iron, machinery steel and tool steel at high tem-
peratures. The similarity of the curves, for different materials, shows
so far as the point of maximum and
minimum is concerned, that the
nature of the material has little
effect on the general character of
the relation of strength to change
of temperature, and farther that
the strength of material is affected
to a great extent by the tempera-
ture.

M
EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON THE STRENGTH OF CAST IRON.
A number of experiments have also been made to determine the
effect of increasing the temperature on the strength of cast iron.
The results of these various tests are shown in diagram No. 7, in which
the abscissas correspond to the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit,
the ordinates of the curve A B to the strength per sq. in. as shown on
the scale to the left, and the ordinates of the curve C D to the elon-
gation per inch of length, as shown on the scale to the right. The
results of each test is indicated by a point.
By study of the curves corresponding to these various tests it will
be noted that the tensile strength of cast iron remains uniform from
a temperature of 70° to that of nearly 700°, but from that point it de-
creases in proportion to the increase of temperature'until it becomes
practically nothing at a temperature of 1240°.
The elongation per inch in length seems to slightly decrease from
a temperature of 100 to 400 degrees after which it increases with in-
crease of temperature until the temperature of 1200 degrees is
reached. The elongation of cast iron is exceedingly small under best
conditions and hence this latter property is one of little importance
except as indicating a brittle region in the neighborhood of 300 or 400
degrees.


ON THE ETHICAL STATUS OF THE ENGINEERING PRO-
FESSION.
CHARLES CARROLL BROWN, '79v M. AM. SOC. C. E.
Ethics in a general sense is denned as " the science of right con-
duct and character; the science which treats of the nature and
grounds of moral obligation and of the rules which ought to deter-
mine conduct in accordance with this obligation; the doctrine of man's
duty in respect to himself and the rights of others."
In a more restricted sense, it is considered to be "a particular
system of principles and rules concerning moral obligations and re-
gard for the rights of others, whether true or false; rules of practice
in respect to a single class of human actions and duties; as social eth-
ics, medical ethics." Evidently, under the definition, these rules may
be formulated, as in the codes of medical societies, the rules of courts
and bar associations, the agreements of architects, the canons of the
church; or they may, like the British Constitution, be so generally re-
cognized that their formulation in definite statements is not neces-
sary, and in the usages of good society. There is no formulated code
for the engineering profession in any of its branches., and careful ob-
servation will fail to discover any distinctive body of ethical doctrine
which is accepted by any large number of professed engineers. We
will not now discuss directly the question of the desirability of or the
objections to formulating such a code, but will consider the ethical
basis of the profession from the standpoint of the more general defi-
nition.
The comprehensive definition of " profession" in the Century Dic-
tionary, states that it is "the calling or occupation which one pro-
fesses to understand and to follow; vocation; specifically a vocation in
which a professed knowledge of some department of science or learn-
ing is used by its practical application to affairs of others, either in
advising, guiding or teaching them, or in serving their interests or
welfare in the practice of an art founded on it.
"Formerly, theology, law and medicine were specifically known
as the professions, but as the applications of science and learning are
extended to other departments of affairs, other vocations also receive
the name. The word implies professed attainments in special knowl-
edge, as distinguished from mere study or investigation; and an ap-
plication of such knowledge to uses for others as a vocation, as dis-
tinguished from its pursuit for one's own purposes. . In professions,
strictly so-called, a preliminary examination as to qualifications is
usually demanded by law or usage, and a license or other official au-
thority founded thereon required. In law, the significance of the
word has been contested under statutes imposing taxes on persons
pursuing any 'occupation, trade or profession,' and under statutes au-


9a
thorizing arrest in civil actions for misconduct in a 1 professional em-
ployment ' and it has been, in the former use, held clearly to include
the vocation of an attorney, and upon the same principle would doubt-
less include physicians, unless the mention of trade, etc., in the same
clause of the statute be ground for interpreting the statute as rela-
ting only to business vocations. Professional employment, in statutes
allowing arrest " (for professional misconduct) " is regarded as not in-
cluding a private agency like that of a factor or real estate broker,
which can be taken up and laid down at pleasure."
According to most of the points of this definition, engineering is
a profession, and it is possible to secure its full recognition by making
it conform to all criteria. Thus, engineering in its highest sense im-
plies professed attainments in special knowledge, as distinguished
from mere skill. The ability to run a line with a transit does not
make an engineer, any more than ability to write a deed makes a law-
yer. We are quite likely, however, to include in the profession all
those who can perform any one or more of the duties which an en-
gineer is expected to be able to perform, when, really, many of them
are no more engineers than nurses are necessarily physicians or build-
ers architects. Engineering is certainly distinguished as practically
dealing with affairs, and as applying its knowledge to uses for others
as a vocation as distinguished from its pursuit for one's own purposes.
-Engineers are not yet required either by law or usage to pass exam-
inations or to take out licenses. They do not yet have the protection
which is given the members of the three learned professions, so-
called, and in frequent instances to the architects. This is true in
the sense of engineering as a profession. Many of the trades closely
connected with the material side of engineering, such as stationary
engineers, plumbers, surveyors in some instances, and others, must
pass an examining board and receive a license. But there is no such
examining board or process as the court or the bar association among
the lawyers, the state board of health and the medical societies among
the physicians. It is possible that an engineer would be taxed under
the law taxing persons pursuing an '• occupation, trade or profession'
on the ground that he was pursuing one of these, but it is very doubt-
ful if he would be fined for misconduct in a "professional. employ-
ment." Since he does not have such protection as other professions
have, he is not in danger of a suit for mal-practice like a physician or
an order from court disbarring him, like an attorney. So long as he
does not violate any of the specific laws against mis-appropriation of
property, the self-styled engineer is safe and free to go on doing all
the injury to his clients that their ignorance will permit, and inci-
dentally to his competent professional "brethren " who are classed
by ignorant employers with the incompetent men with whom they
have had experience, and suffer the same condemnation.
True professional ethics as a system and engineering as a profes-
sion are comparatively recent developments in their respective lines


THE TECHNIC.
of evolution, and it may be both interesting and profitable to give
briefly a few of the steps in their progress, that we may better under-
stand their present condition and stage of development, and their re-
lations to each other.
The three so-called learned professions were doubtless originally
one, and were practiced by the priests, who were at the same time
spiritual and temporal advisers and alleviators of bodily ills. This
came naturally from the desire of man, even in the early stages of
his civilization, to bring himself into unity with the higher power to
which he considered himself to be subject. The priest was the media-
tor in this process, and, by analogy became the mediator between
man and man in their frequent discords, and even between man and
his own body, when a lack of unity in this relation brought about a
condition of disease. Further development, and the accompanying
differentiation of effort, finally, separated the three and they have
continued their respective courses of development in parallel lines.
It has not been a century since these three were the only learned pro-
fessions. The enormous intellectual development of civilized man
and the resulting vast improvement in physical conditions have
caused a large addition to the number of vocations in whice a " pro-
fessed knowledge of some department of learning is used, by its prac-
tical application to affairs of others in advice, guidance or instruc-
tion, or in the practice of an art in their service." We are rapidly
coming to the point where a change in the basis of classification of
professions must be made. The original man had a very dim idea of
what he was actually striving for, and his idea of unity was fairly
well satisfied when his immediate disputes with his deity, his fellow
man or his body were settled with some approach to fairness, so that
the three professions have long held the positions of arbitrators in
these primitive strivings for unity in their various fields. The world's
idea of the meaning of unity is now vastly larger, and the basis of
the classification must be correspondingly enlarged. We may divide
the various professions, therefore, into three classes, similar to the
former, having to do with the spiritual, the intellectual and the
physical relations of man, but with the higher modern idea of unitv
as the governing principle. The most important professions in these
three divisions are the religious leader, the teacher and the engineer.
Such other professions as have an enduring basis can be assigned
readily to one of these three classes by their most prominent charac-
teristics.
As the philosopher and religious teacher and the guide in intel-
lectual pursuits expand the spiritual and intellectual life, as the
artists in various lines add to the appreciation of the various expres-
sions of spiritual and intellectual power, so the engineer reduces to
subjection the powers of nature and enlarges and beautifies the
expression of man's power in the formation of his physical surround-
ings.
/


95
Evidently the engineer belongs to what is, strictly speaking, one
of the most learned of the professions. He must not only be a man
of high intellectual development and spiritual insight, but he must
be able to apply his power to the training of the powers of nature.
His profession requires quite as much preparation as do those which
have for their object the training of the spiritual and intellectual
powers of man. It is lower in estimation only by the amount that the
process of subjection of physical forces to perform required offices is
considered to be less valuable than the direct training of the powers
of the human mind. It stands on a par with all those professions
whose objects is the serving of the interests or welfare of our fellow
men in the practice of arts founded on them. .
How many of us recognize these facts and make our preparation
for practice commensurate with the legitimate demands of our pro-
fession? In this broad light it is not sufficient to have learned the
use of a few tools such as mathematics, and to have acquired a knowl-
edge of a few sciences which will be of practical use in a narrow
line, but it is essential that the view be broadened, the intellectual
powers be developed in full, that a man may become a professional
man, fit to "advise, guide and teach others and practice the arts
founded on his profession ;" and not sink to the level of a craftsman,
who has only skill with his tools and can not grasp the large profes-
sional problems and offer adequate solutions.
In the early days the priests were few and took care to strengthen
their power over their superstitious fellow men by many arts. As
numbers increased and as civilization advanced, there came to be
differences of opinion and divisions, which showed the awakening
people that the priests were men like themselves. The instinct for
self-preservation developed what might be called a system of profes-
sional ethics which was more complete and more thoroughly enforced
than any system that has since been adopted. Many of the rules and
customs, especially in the medical and legal professions, are relics or
modifications of the ancient iron-clad systems, and doubtless owe
much of their authority and validity to this fact. The newer profes-
sions do not have this body of ancient custom upon which to depend,
and must base their ethical systems on broader grounds to have them
accepted by modern thought. This is one of the reasons for the
strenuous objection that is made by many to definite codes of pro-
cedure.
Engineering as a profession is not a century old. Its founders
were men self-educated or educated for other lines of effort, who
were drawn into its field by the imperative demands of the times and
of their own natures. They worked largely by empirical rules and
received recognition as professional men with high honors from the
public and their clients by sheer force of ability and character. As
the vast scheme of material improvement developed, which, in a
sense, they may be said to have inaugurated, the number of men


THE TECHNIC.
necessary to direct it rapidly increased, and special means of prepar-
ation for the work were demanded. Naturally the methods of train-
ing were at first largely based on the more mechanical side of the
profession, and the demand for early completion of the preliminary
course of preparation led to a restriction of study to the more di-
rectly practical lines. Further development and differentiation has
tended to continue this limitation of the education of the engineer.
The result is too great specialization, a narrowness of view which
shuts off the view of the other branches of the profession and of the
world, and magnifies the importance of the individual in his own eyes.
An observed consequence is, that (with the exceptions due to unusual
powers of mind) the great engineers are the men who have had no
preliminary training for the profession, or had with it a considerable
proportion of the old-fashioned classical education, or had excep-
tional opportunities for development by early contact with men and
affairs.
Checks in the progress of material development throw many men,
particularly those with little breadth of training, out of their fixed
employment. The necessity of a livelihood causes them to exploit
more promising fields or a defective moral training and a restricted
view of their relations to the profession and to their fellows, leads
them into devices for securing employment or money which are far
from complying with their moral obligations and regard for the
rights of others. The ignorance of employers and, in the case of
public works, the exigencies of politics, are additional incentives for
such men to violations of the principles of ethics. The first wrong
steps are doubtless often due to a lack of knowledge of the ultimate
consequences of an act. A thorough grounding in the ethical princi-
ples which must underlie all permanently successful dealings with
our fellow men would prevent many such lapses.
These various steps in the development of the profession, and the
practical neglect of the ethical element in engineering education for
many years, had opened the way to the present unsatisfactory condi-
tion of the engineering profession in this regard. Instead of retain-
ing the standing among the highest which it had when in the hands
of the great men of the early part of the century, its general aver-
age is materially lowered, both in the opinion of the members of the
profession and in that of the general public. Happily there are few
branches of the engineering profession in which it can be said that
the ethical standard is actually low, as yet. Those which come most
closely in contact with municipal and other public work where poli-
tics, partisan or otherwise, has a considerable influence, show the
greatest effect of the lowering tendency.
What is necessary Jto improve the situation? The most evident
steps are first, a better appreciation of the necessity of adherence
to moral principles among the members of the profession. This can
be effected most quickly by the education of the new recruits, made


definite by concrete instruction in the class of problems likely to
arise in practice. A broader view of life and a more varied prepara-
tion for professional work and for participation in the general work
of the world will aid in this direction also. Even if he must begin
his specific occupation a year or two later in life, the engineer will
find that he has saved time and enormously enriched his life as well
as increased his earning capacity. The second is a better apprecia-
tion of the value of the engineering profession among these who
may have physical improvement of various kinds more or less directly
under their control. This can be secured by the improvement of the
individual engineer by the broader education suggested, and by some
process of separating the sheep from the goats, so that the engineer-
ing profession may be saved the odium of failures and frauds perpe-
trated by those who can by no stretch of any imagination but their
own be considered as engineers. Unfortunately, there are also some
good technical engineers whose moral obliquities must continue to
cast discredit upon the profession until we have a formulated ethical
code by which they can be read out of the profession. Whether
we shall adopt such a code seems at present to depend upon those
who are willing to suffer in silence, those who are not in positions
where they are affected seriously by unprofessional conduct of their
fellows, and those who think a code would not be advantageous to
their individual interests.
In parenthesis let me say definitely what is inferred throughout,
that our discussion is mainly in regard to the ethical principles of the
action of professional men in the highest sense, those who "advise,
guide or teach their fellow men by the use of their profession," and
that, while the same principles apply throughout all ranks of the pro-
fession, those who are occupying semi-professional positions under the
direction and pay of their fellows, or who are engaged in the more
mechanical branches, are less directly affected by the wrong actions
of other engineers and see less of the deleterious effects of competi-
tion, unrestricted by the power of clients to discriminate, or by re-
quirements of technical ability or professional honor.
The hostility of such members of the American Society of Civil
Engineers as attend annual meetings to any formulation of regula-
tions of practice, and even to discussion of the question is shown by
the prompt manner in which any resolution on the subject is laid on
the table. At the last annual meeting a resolution favoring judicious
legal restrictions of the use of the title Civil Engineer was so treated,
one member resorting to the specious claim that it was an expression
of opinion, which is forbidden by the constitution. An eminent
engineer, whose preliminary preparation was for the practice of law
inquired if it would be necessary for him to take up the practice of
that profession, since he had been admitted to the bar, and had not
received the degree of Civil Engineer. He forgot entirely that his
admission to the bar was a process, technically at least, independent
9


THE TECHNIC.
of his receipt of a degree from the college of law, and that admis-
sion to the profession of Civli Engineering, under the resolution, would
be equally independent of graduation from a technical school. 'It is
true also, as he doubtless knows, that there are lawyers as prominent
in their profession as he is in his, who are quite as innocent of
experience in a law school as he is of attendance at a school of engi-
neering.
The president of the society last year, an officer in the Corps of
Engineers of the United States Army, gave a short and strong pre-
sentation of his argument against codes of professional ethics and
protective legislation. In brief it is,—Education will remove the ne-
cessity for the latter and an application of the Golden Rule, " which
is specially desirable in the engineering profession," will make the
former unnecessary. Let the engineers and the people take their
hard knocks until they learn these two lessons. Fortunately for the
president, he is not in a position where any of the hard knocks which
should reach the misdemeanants can reach him, as they do reach
many equally earnest and honest men who do try to practice the
Golden Rule. Numerous capable and honest men are annually driven
from the profession by their dislike of meeting the unfair competi-
tion which they find and the low prices which self-styled engineers,
and even some good engineers are willing to make to secure work.
Better pay and pleasanter surroundings lead them away from a pro-
fession so loosely held together and subject to such ruinous competi-
tion. Their withdrawal causes a lowering of the average tone of the
profession. In municipal and other public work the change of offi-
cers renders it impossible for education to have any effect. If a man
does learn, it has been at many dollars expense to his constituents,
and by the time he has learned he is displaced and the educational
process must begin anew. Few politicians can be accused of applying
the Golden Rule extensively. President Harrod's processes both fail
in this case. In some cases in the government service they both ap-
ply. There are all gradations between the two extremes.
The foregoing is a statement of the problem in part from both
sides. What decision will the reader reach as to the process of solu-
tion? Is it not the imperative duty of every engineer to himself and
to the profession which he has chosen to make a thorough study of all
possible phases and to determine the ethical basis upon which he will
rest his personal practice?
Thorough study, observation and experience will show beyond a
doubt that the highest professional success and a lasting reputation,
professionally and personally, can only be attained by strict adher-
ence to the principles of ethics in the fullest sense of the definition
given. It will also show that uniform success in the lower walks of
the profession, and personal happiness in one's work is dependent di-
rectly upon the right choice of the motive principles of his life. The
effect of a bad start can sometimes be overcome by later efforts, but


the only career which is entirely satisfactory, is one which is right
from beginning to end. Be sure to start right.
The question of the amount of aid which shall be given to the
weaker brethren, and the amount of protection which shall be given
to the rank and file of competent, honest men who seem to be much
in need of it under the present conditions among our clients, is one
which the young men, just entering the profession will probably have
to decide. The nature of this aid and protection, whether by legal
enactments or close professional organization, or both will in large
part be determined by them, because the indications are that the
conditions will demand some action by the time they have attained
the positions of influence in the profession.
But, no matter what the decision on this subject may be, each
one must look out for his personal standing, and not be led oft by the
apparently brilliant successes of some who seem to be deviating from
the straight and narrow way. The success is only apparent, or it is
followed by its legitimate consequence, a disastrous downfall. The
brilliant operator may even succeed in amassing a fortune by his il-
legitimate methods, but it is at the expense of all else that makes
life a real success.
THE YARYAN HEATING SYSTEM, PLANT NO. 2.
ABSTRACT OF THESIS OF RALPH COLLAMORE AND CHAS. O. COOK, 1897.
The heating plants operated by Mr. Yaryan in Toledo are essen-
tially hot water systems. The water heated to a temperature, say
150° to 220°, is pumped through well insulated mains at a pressure
sufficient to insure a rapid circulation throughout the system. This
water is heated by the exhaust steam from the engines and the pumps
in the plant, and when there is not sufficient exhaust steam, the tem-
perature of the water is raised in a boiler through which it passes.
This boiler is in use while the lighting engines are not running.
The test was made at the Yaryan heating plant No. 2, February
19th and 20th, 1897. This plant is located in the square formed by
21st, 22nd, and Madison Streets, and Park Place, Toledo, Ohio. The
building is a one story brick structure 45 ft. by 72 ft.; the boiler and
engine rooms each occupying about half of it. The engine room
equipment is as follows:—A Smith's Dixie blower made by the Ameri-
can Blower Co. of Detroit, and used to produce a forced draught in
the boilers; a 5 inch by 7 inch balanced valve Erie engine used to run
the blower; one Deane (Holyoke) direct acting pump, 16 inch by 14
inch by 24 inches, and two Hughes duplex pumps, 8 inch by 6 inch by
12 inches, used to pump the hot water through the heating mains; a
Yaryan condenser containing 1000 square feet of heating surface; a


THE TECHNIC.
Yaryan oil separator and two Thompson-Ryan dynamos, 50 and 100 K.
W., direct connected to McEwan engines, 11 inch by 12 inches and 16
inch by 16 inch. In the fire room are four tubular boilers, 72 inch by
16 feet, each containing 90 3i inch tubes. Two of the boilers are used
for steam, one for heating water for the heating system, while the
fourth is kept in reserve. The furnaces are of the Dutch oven type,
fired by the Jones underfeed stokers. The boilers are fed by a Marsh
pump which draws the feed water from a hot well connected with the
condenser. Just outside the building is an expansive tank for the
heating system 12 feet in diameter and 10 feet high. The chimney is
hexagonal, being 60 feet high with least diameter of 4 feet 4 inches.
The heating part of the plant consists of a heater (or condenser),
a hot water boiler, pumps and the outside piping. The mains consist
of two pipes side by side, one conveying the outgoing and the other
the incoming water. These pipes are insulated with common one
inch boards so arranged as to form air spaces as shown in the accom-
panying diagram. This insulation covers all the piping except the
Pipe Insulation.
expansion joints which are 6 feet Us. The piping consists of 1.520
feet of 6 inch, 13,280 feet of 4 inch and 1,800 feet of 3 inch pipe, which
are laid in a ditch three feet deep. The service pipes are li inch.
The water enters the pump from the expansion tank is forced into the
heater, from there through the hot water boiler and then into the
outgoing main. During the" test the hot water boiler was not in use,
while the dynamos were running as then there was enough exhaust
steam to heat the water.
When the dynamos were not running the heat imparted to the
water by the heater and by the hot water boiler was found iu the fol-
lowing manner: The calculation is based on the time from 9:25 P. M.
on the 19th, to 4:00 P. M. on the 20th, 184 hours, during which time the
dynamos were not running. The amount of water that went through
the pumps was known approximately by the stroke displacement.


101
Its rise in temperature was also known. The number of heat units
imparted to the water by the boiler was known (the efficiency of the
hot water boiler was taken the same as that of the steam boilers), and
hence the difference between the heat units in the water that went
through the pump, and the number of heat, units imparted io the
water by the boiler gives the number of heat units imparted by the
heater. Allowing 3% slip 19,165 gallons were pumped per hour.
19165 X 18&amp; = 356,181 gals. = 47585.7 cu. ft.
Average temperature incoming water = 141.9°.
Average temperature outgoing water —- 171.3°.
A cu. ft. of water at 141.9° weighs 61.34 lbs.
47585.7 X 61.34 - 2,918,906.8 lbs. sent through the system in 18
hours. This was raised 29.4° (171.3° —141.9°).
2,918,906.8 X 29.4° = 85,815,859 heat units in the water going
through pump.
The heat units in the Hocking coal used was found to be 10,900.
5027.5 lbs. coal burned—This contained 6.73% moisture leaving
4687 lbs. of dry coal. The efficiency of the boiler was 74% and hence
only 74% of 4687 pounds or 3468.3 pounds were available.
3468.3 X 10900 = 37,804,470 heat units given to the water by the
boiler.
85,815,859 — 37,804,470 = 48,011,389 heat units received by the water
in the heater.
As the amount of condensation was known as was also the tem-
perature of the hot water as it entered and left the heater, the heat
units received in the heater were determined from this data as a check
upon the other method. The efficiency of the heater was assumed to
be 75%. This gave about the same result as the first method.
On the morning of February 21st the temperature of the water
was taken at the plant, and at several houses on the system in order
to find the drop in the mains. The temperature at the plant was
170° F. At a house 1,320 feet from the plant the temperature was
161.5° F., here the water was throttled. At another house 1,220 feet
distant the temperature was 166.5° with the valves wide open. Tak-
ing the latter as a fair working value the difference is 3.5° F. giving a
drop of about 15° F. per mile. Assuming that the houses are at an
average distance of one quarter of a mile from the plant, the heat
loss in the mains amounts to 11.9 per cent., which brings the heating
.efficiency of the system to about 55 per cent.
This plant is connected with the old system (or first plant) and
there was a certain leakage, but this was found to be comparatively
small.
There are 37 houses heated, using a total radiating surface of 32,-
760 square feet. This is based upon a heating ratio of 30 to 1 for zero
weather. The farthest house is at a distance of 2,300 feet from the
plant. These houses are heated by either direct or indirect radia-
tion. In some cases where steam heat has been used the hot water


THE TECHNIC.
pipes are connected to the steam pipes. Where hot air furnaces
have been used it is possible to supplant the furnaces by coils of hot
water pipes.
From a pamphlet describing the Yaryan Heating Process the fol-
lowing is taken. t
"The plant herein described is essentially a hot water system,
using the by product for producing lights. The result is interesting,
as it shows that the sale of his by-product, i. e., electric lights, brings an
income sufficient to pay all expenses, including fuel, labor, etc., leav-
ing the entire revenue derived from the sale of heat as his profit.
His charges for the use of heat have been based upon the former cost
of coal, in all cases. Thus it is clearly proven that a central station
can furnish heat to the user at the same price he can produce it him-
self, thus avoiding all vexations incident to do domestic heating: no
coal to handle, no ashes to remove, no dust to annoy the careful house-
wife, a uniform temperature at all hours of day and night, no danger
from fire, and the central station, from the sale of its by-product, pays
all the cost of producing the heat so distributed, and retains for a
profit all the receipts from sale of heat.''
This statement is also made. "A charge of $3.50 to $4.00 per 1000
cubic feet heated for the season in which heat is required, averages
about the cost of hard coal for the same service."
The coal cost of 1,000,000 B. T. U. delivered to the residences is
about 9.6 cents.

ELECTRICAL CONDUIT CONSTRUCTION.
GEO. B. SPRINGER, '90.
The adoption of ordinances in many of our large cities prohibiting
the use of overhead wires for the distribution of electric current for
light, power, etc., has resulted in the construction of extensive un-
derground systems of conduit and it is the purpose of this article to
describe the system now in use by the Chicago Edison Co.
Before proceeding however to describe the present system it may
be well to make a few statements concerning systems which have
been used in the past.
The wooden pump-log was one of the first kind of duct used in
conduit. It is simply a log, as its name implies, about 4 inches square
and 8 feet long, bored out inside to 3 inches diameter. Of course the
objection to this form of duct is that it rots out in a few years leaving
the cable unprotected. About 310,000 feet of pump-log have been
laid by this company, but its use now is entirely discontinued.
A conduit called the Dorsett from the name of the man who in-
vented it has been used to some extent. In Pig. 1 on the right can be


THE TECHNIC.
seen a piece of this conduit broken and projecting from the earth,
several cables running out of the ducts. It was made in solid lengths
of 3 feet each, having a sort of bell end for joining and was composed
of a mixture of tar and asphalt. Seven to ten holes ran through this
cylindrical block, which formed the ducts. The whole block was
about a foot in diameter, and the ducts from two to three inches.
Fig. i.
This form of conduit was not found to be very satisfactory as the
joints would settle and break. 308,000 feet have been laid.
The Edison tube system, though not exactly a conduit, may be
considered in this connection. This system has been used very ex-
tensively and consists essentially of a series of tubes or iron pipes en-
closing three copper wires surrounded by a specially prepared com-
pound. The ends of the tubes are joined in the manner shown in the
cut and enclosed in a coupling box which is also filled with the com-
pound. The lengths of tube are 20 feet each and have a diameter of
from li to 3 inches. The larger size of tubes are used as feeders to
carry the current from the power plant to junction boxes which are


generally located at the street corners. From these junction boxes
the current is distributed into mains which are the smaller sized tubes
and from these the services are tapped.
END BOX- STRAIGHT LINE BOX.
The tubes are laid bare in the earth about 2' or 2' 6" below the
surface, and consequently the first cost of construction is much less
than that of the more modern systems of conduit. The maintenance
however is very much more expensive on account of short circuits
and burn-outs in wet weather. These are constantly occurring as
water will work its way into the coupling boxes and cne or more
pieces of tube are frequently burnt their entire length.
The only way to repair the damage is to locate the trouble be-
tween junction boxes and dig for it, and it is often necessary to ex-
cavate 50 to 60 feet before the burnt out portion can be found.
This constant tearing up of the streets is both costly and annoying,
and consequently, although 560,000 feet of tubing has been laid up to
the present time, it is fast being abandoned or torn out and replaced
by the more modern system of conduit which will now be described.
This system consists of pipes or ducts surrounded by concrete en-
tering brick manholes or vaults which are built from 300 to 500 feet
apart usually at street intersections and in the middle of long blocks.
Small distribution holes are built between from 50 to 100 feet apart
for the purpose of running services off the main line into buildings.
Various kinds of ducts are used for the conduit, among them be-
ing cement lined, tile and all-cement pipes. The cement lined pipes
manufactured by the National Conduit and Cable Co., of New York,
are made of cement about i inch thick, inclosed in a sheet iron cover


THE TECHNIC.
ing which is securely rivetted around the cement, thus protecting it
from damage in transit, and also in laying. The ends of the pipes are
provided with a male and female joint. The pipes are made 8 feet
long and about 3 inches in inside diameter. About 326,000 duct feet
of this class of conduit have been laid.
The Camp tile is used quite a good deal and makes a nice conduit.
It is simply a vitrified tile pipe manufactured in lengths of about 18
inches, and about 4 inches square on the outside, and 3 inches inside
diameter. The lengths being short require many more joints and
consequently more time in laying a given length, thus rendering it
more expensive than the laying of the cement lined or cement pipe.
The company has 195,000 duct feet of tile conduit.
An all-cement pipe manufactured in Chicago is used to a consid-
erable extent, one advantage claimed for it being that when surround-
ed by material such as it is made of it forms a block of concrete as it
were with the ducts running through it. The ends of the pipes are
placed abutting squarely against each other and the inside surfaces
brought into continuity by means of a sort of rubber spool about 4
inches long on the end of a rod called a mandrel. These spools are a
little larger than the diameter of the pipe in the middle and taper
down each way so that when the pipes are abutted and shoved tightly
together they are sure to have their inside surfaces continuous. This
method of laying takes more time than the cement lined pipes with
their male and female joints require, but if done properly, is about as
satisfactory. 316,000 duct feet of this conduit are in use at present.
At street intersections where many pipes are liable to come to-
gether, it is sometimes impracticable to lay cement pipes and con-
crete in the usual way to be described hereafter. In cases of this
kind it is found to be more expeditious to use wrought iron pipe about
3 inches in diameter and in lengths of about 20 feet, with coupling and
threads on each end. Any desired length can thus be coupled up and
shoved through small openings or over or under a net-work of ob-
structing pipes where it were impossible to properly place and tamp
concrete. Over 226,000 feet of iron pipe is thus buried in street inter-
sections and difficult places about the city.
The method of laying the ducts is as follows:—A trench of the
proper width depending upon the number of pipes to be laid abreast
is dug generally from 3 to 4 feet 6 inches deep. The depth is governed
by the number of pipes to be laid in height, and also depends upon the
obstructions met, some of which are gas pipes, water mains, telephone
and telegraph conduits, sewers, etc. In Figs. 1 and 2 several pipes of
various sizes may be seen, as well as some conduit surrounded by con-
crete running directly across the excavation for an Edison manhole.
It is often necessary to take these pipes into the manholes, building
the walls around them. It is desirable to have at least 2 feet 6 inches
of earth on top of the finished conduit in order that the pressure may
be distributed and thus not cause conduit to settle or crack. The


107
pipes are laid on a grade of about 2 inches per 100 feet at least,
though a much steeper grade is frequently necessary in order to get
over or under obstructions. A summit may be made in the middle of
a block between two manholes, or the grade may be run all one way,
the principal object being to avoid abrupt changes which cause fric-
tion in pulling cables through the pipes. For the same reason curves
in alignment are avoided except in cases of absolute necessity.
When the grade has been established and the trench trained up
properly, 3 inches of concrete is placed in the bottom of the ditch
and well rammed. Then a layer of pipe is put in leaving 1 inch be-
tween adjoining pipes into which fine concrete is rammed, 3 inches is
rammed on each side of the pipes, another layer of pipes put in and
so on until the required number are in, when 3 inches of concrete is
placed on top and the trench filled in.
Fig. 2.
The concrete is mixed in the proportion of one part cement to two
of sand and three of crushed stone. American Portland cement is
used, the Atlas or Star being the brands used most. The ducts are


THE TECHNIC.
built into the manholes in the manner shown in Fig. 2, a pocket being
made into the brickwork to render the training of cables around the
walls more efficacious. The manholes vary in size from 5 to 6 feet
square for small ones, while some are as large as 10 X 15 feet. Often
subways are built the whole width of streets, from curb to curb where
a large number of cables have to be used. The walls of the manholes
are usually^ inches thick, except very large holes which have a 12
inch wall. In building the roofs, eye beams are used of a depth suit-
able for the width of span.
In holes under 6 feet in span, 3 or 4 inch tee iron is used, spaced
about 9 inches apart to allow brick to be placed lengthwise between
them. In holes from 8 to 9 feet and over it is more economical to
build an arched roof thus economizing iron.
The question is frequently asked by those not familiar with con-
duit work, as to how the cables are gotten into the ducts when once
they are laid. This is a very simple matter when understood. A
number of wooden rods about i inch in diameter and 3 feet long, with
a hook and eye on opposite ends are shoved through a duct by joining
one after the other together. When enough rods have been shoved
through from one manhole to reach another, say a block away, a man
in the second manhole begins uncoupling the rods and pulling the re-
maining ones through and with them a small wire or rope which has
been attached to the last rod coupled on in the first hole. When the
wire or rope has been pulled through, the cable is attached and
pulled from one hole to the other. When heavy cable is to be pulled
as for instance, that having an area of 1,000,000 or 1,500,000 circular
mils, a capstan is usually placed opposite the mouth of the hole on the
surface of the street and a number of men wind the rope up on the
drum of the capstan, thus pulling the cable which is unwound and fed
from a large reel revolving on an axle at the other manhole. In this
way cable is pulled several blocks until the weight becomes too great
to pull conveniently, when another piece is started at the hole where
the first piece is ended, and pulled as far as desired, and so on, joints
between the ends of the cables being made in the manholes.
This company has been constructing conduits for about six years,
and a general summary of the system owned by them is as follows:—
Total conduit of all kinds, 1,684,000 duct feet.
Total conduit of all kinds, 283,700 trench feet.
Total length of cable in ducts, 2.000,000 lineal feet.
Total number of manholes, 1,400.


We have endeavored to follow the example set by last year's
board in getting out our Technic several weeks before Commence-
ment. This we have been able to do through the promptness with
which contributors have responded. We wish to take this opportun-
ity for thanking them for the interest they have shown in our an-
nual's success.

The Engineering Alumni of Chicago have inaugurated a custom
which will be of great value to the Engineering Department and the
Engineering Society. We refer to the first annual banquet of the
Engineering Alumni of Chicago, held Saturday evening, May 14, 1898.
A large number of our graduates were present and report it a great
success. May the good work go on.
The Technic is indebted to Prof. C. G. Taylor for photographs of
the generators of the new lighting plant.
The Engineering Society is indebted to C. T. Johnston, '95, for a
portfolio of blue prints illustrating a Wyoming Irrigation System; also
to J. K. Freitag, '94, for the third annual report of the Boston Tran-
sit Commission.
The ninth annual tour of inspection taken during spring vacation
by the electricals and mechanicals under the charge of John R. Al-
len was one of the most important events in the history of our de-
partment of this year. The boys report a highly instructive and
pleasant trip.

We wish to ask our readers not to forget our advertisers, to whom
no small share of the credit is due for this issue as well as former is-
sues of The Technic.

Engineers find the camera a valuable aid, as in making reports to
their chiefs of the progress of work on a contract. They find that a
photograph will give a more definite idea than the longest written
report. Photographs containing the data as to number of men em-
ployed, state of weather, etc., will convey an idea how much work a
certain number of men will do in a given time.
The Rochester Optical, Co., manufacturers of the Premo Cam-
eras, have kindly aided us this year by advertising in our annual.
We hope when our readers are thinking of buying a camera that they
will have the Rochester Optical, Co., in mind and buy a Premo.

THE STEAM MACHINERY OF THE U. S. S. YOSEMITE.
MORTIMER E. COOLEY, CHIEF ENGINEER, U. S. N.
The U.S.S. Yosemite was originally built for the Morgan Line of steam-
ers running between New York and New Orleans. She was one of several
freight steamers making regular connections with the Southern Pacific
Railroad, and was in the service of the company as "El Sud" (The South)
from the date of her building in 1892 until her purchase by the govern-
ment in the spring of 1898. Early in April, 1898, she was sent with the
U. S. S. Dixie, formerly "El Rio" (The River), to the ship yard of the
Newport News Ship Building and Dry Dock Co., to be converted into an
auxiliary cruiser for service in the war with Spain. The principal changes
consisted in the removal of the 1-inch covering of her freight decks and
the wooden strips to keep the freight away from the bulkheads; magazines
and storerooms were constructed in the hold; additional quarters were
built for the officers and the old quarters rearranged; wash-rooms were
built for the crew; sponsons were built for the battery of 6-pounders, and
the decks strengthened and ports made for the 5-inch battery. The main
steam piping, the steam lines for the auxiliary machinery, the fire
service lines of piping and the electric wiring were placed below the
water line. The upper engine room and steam steering engine, above
the water line, were protected by a 21o-inch belt of nickel steel armor.


THE TFXHNIC.
Other protection was secured by coal bunkers varying in width from four
to twelve and fourteen feet. As four feet of coal affords a protection
equal to one inch of armor, the principal machinery above the water line
was protected by the equivalent of from three to four inches of armor
when the bunkers were full of coal. Had there been sufficient time, an
additional belt of armor would have been put on the outside of the ship
in wake of the machinery. The main engines and boilers were
examined, and such important repairs as would not delay the ship were
made. The ship was docked for cleaning and painting and for exami-
nation of the propeller and outboard valves.
The new auxiliary machinery installed consisted of five double-engine
ammunition hoists, three steam driven blowers for ventilating the maga-
zines and holds, a fresh water distilling plant of 7500 gallons per day and
a new dynamo.
A multitude of minor changes that could be done while the important
work was in progress were also made. Additional pumps, an engine
room telegraph, and a steam launch were installed.
Approximately 1000 men, working day and night and Sundays, com-
pleted this work in about two weeks time.
The Michigan Naval Brigade, who were to man the Yosemite, had
been in waiting on board the receiving ship Franklin at the Norfolk
Navy Yard for nearly a week. As the workmen went over the side on
Saturday evening, May 7, 1898, the crew came on board, and the work of
cleaning the ship and receiving stores and supplies was begun immediate-
ly. In ten days, May 17, the ship swung out into the stream, and the
next morning dropped down to Hampton Roads. On the 18th she put to
sea for a trial of her machinery and for target practice, returning the next
day and reported ready for sea. The principal events of the cruise,
chronologically arranged, have been recorded in the Michigan Alumnus,
issue of December, 1898.
The hull of the U. S. S. Yosemite is of iron. She was built very
substantially, and was in many respects well adapted for use as an aux-
iliary cruiser.
The general dimensions of this ship are given in the following table:

Engines.—The main engines are triple expansion, cylinders 32, 52 and
84 inches diameter by 54 inches stroke, not jacketed. At full speed they
make from 74 to 75 revolutions per minute, driving the ship at a speed of
from 14.5 to 15 knots per hour. Careful comparisons with the daily runs
showed that 5 revolutions per minute was equivalent to one knot per
hour, this ratio extending from about half to full speed. The main
engines developed at full power about 3700 indicated horsepowers.
The engines are fitted with the Marshal valve gear as modified by
Horace See. The main valves are piston valves, one each for the high
and intermediate cylinders and two for the low. The cut-off is controlled
in all cylinders by tail screws in the radial gears. The reversing gear is
the ordinary "Ram Gear" operated by steam. Tne condenser extends
the length of the engine on one side, forming part of the engine frame
work, and has 1,290 tubes, giving a total cooling surface of 5,562 square
feet. The air pump is connected to the L. P. cross-head with levers, and
has a water cylinder 38 inches in diameter and a stroke of 25 inches.
Connected to the air pump cross-head are one bilge and two feed pumps,


THE TECHNIC.
of the plunger type. The cooling water is circulated through the tubes of
the condenser, making three passes, by a 48-inch centrifugal pump driven
by a single cylinder engine 11 inches diameter and 12 inches stroke.
Boilers.—There are three double ended main boilers and one single
ended auxiliary boiler. Diameter of main boilers 13 feet 10 inches, length
21 feet 6 inches. Each main boiler has 6 corrugated furnaces 47 inches
in diameter. The total grate surface is 493 square feet. The total
heating surface is 10,316square feet. Each boiler has two 6-inch pop safety-
valves set to blow off at 165 pounds pressure. The smoke pipe is 9
feet in diameter and 64 feet high above the grate. Provision is made for
circulating the water in the boilers while getting up steam.
Propeller.—There is one screw propeller having 4 bronze blades
secured to a cast iron hub. The diameter is 18 feet, pitch 22 feet.
Indicators.—The engines are supplied with 3 steam indicators, con-
nections and reducing motions.
Auxiliary Machinery.—There was no auxiliary condenser, a serious
defect in a ship having so many auxiliaries. No inconvenience was exper-
ienced with the engines in motion, but when stopped it was impossible
to free the condenser of condensed steam, consequently when starting
again there was a considerable loss of fresh water and the danger of
wrecking the air pump. This was in part remedied by the addition of a
special pump connected to the bottom of the condenser when the ship
returned to the ship yard; and more recently an auxiliary condenser has
been added. There are two 10x6xl0-inch Worthington pumps in the
engine room which can be used as feed, fire and bilge pumps, and for
circulating water in the boilers, for pumping out the boilers and for
operating the ash ejectors; one 8x5xl2-inch Blake pump, Admiralty pat-
tern,pumping from the bottom of the condenser and from the hot well to the
boilers. There is one vertical steam ash hoist, and two Horace See ash
ejectors operated by a water jet under 180 pounds pressure. Other steam
pumps are as follows: One 5}4x3%x5-mch Worthington fresh water
pump, one 6x8)£x6-inch Blake duplex sanitary pump, and a duplicate
pump for circulating water for the distillers, one 6x45ex6-inch vertical
Worthington feed pump for the evaporators, and one 4}nx2?4x2,34x4-inch
Worthington single pump for the evaporators. There are also one No. 14}»
and two No. 9}£ Metropolitan injectors for feeding the boilers. The after
trimming tank is fitted with a large steam siphon for filling it with sea
water and for emptying it. There is also one jacking engine, five doable
engine ammunition hoists, three double engine winches, one steam
steering engine, one steam anchor hoist, one steam capstan, and three
steam driven ventilating fans. There are a total of 35 steam auxiliaries,
and 53 steam cylinders.
Distillers and Evaporators.—The ship is provided with two evaporators
having a total heating surface of 304 square feet, and two distillers having


5
a total cooling surface of 164.5 square feet. Each evaporator contains 62
2-inch brass tubes, and each distiller 121 %-inch brass tubes coated with
tin. The maximum distilling capacity is 7,500 gallons, and the ordinary
capacity 6,000 gallons of fresh water per day.
Bunkers.—There are 55,663 cubic feet of bunker space in which 1,290.5
tons (of 2,240 pounds) of bituminous coal, at the rate of 43 cubic feet per
ton, can be, and 1,200 tons have been stowed. There are 3,119 cubic feet
of bunker space around the engine room above the water line in which 84
tons of anthracite coal have been stowed. In addition to the above, 300
tons of coal can be, and 134 tons have been stowed in bags on the berth
decks.
Electric Lights.—The engine room and shaft alley are lighted by 27
fixed incandescent lamps of 16 candle power each, and the fire rooms by 16
lamps. There are, besides, 9 lamps for general use in the engine depart-
ment. There is one General Electric Co., direct connected engine and
dynamo. The diameter of cylinder V&gt;% inches, stroke 5 inches, 450 revolu-
tions per minute. Dynamo, 91 amperes, 110 volts. There was, dlso,
one B. W. Payne Co. engine, diameter of cylinder 7 inches, stroke 8
inches, 350 revolutions per minute, connected by belt friction pulleys to
a Eureka dynamo (Loomis System), voltage 100, amperes unknown.
This has since been replaced by a second generating set like the first.
Steam Launch.—Length of hull 30 feet, breadth of hull 8 feet, depth of
hull 5 feet, draft of water forward 2 feet, aft 3 feet. Diameter of H. P.
cylinder 3)4 inches, L. P. cylinder 7 inches, stroke 7 inches, keel con-
denser. It is fitted with a Ward boiler, having seven square feet of grate
surface. The bunker capacity is 500 pounds of coal, and the fresh water
tank capacity 50 gallons. Speed of launch 8 knots.
Synopsis of the Log.—Between May 16 aud September 22 the total
time that the engines were in operation was 1432 hours; after getting
fairly under way, 1326 hours. The total number of revolutions made
was 3,542,610; after getting fairly under way, 3,455,610. The total num-
ber of knots made was 11,808. The total weight of coal used for all
purposes was 2,911 tons (of 2240 pounds); and for steaming purposes,
2,049 tons. The total weight of refuse from coal, for all purposes was 341
tons, and for steaming purposes 247 tons. During this entire time there
were no breakages or casualties of importance.
On June 30 a somewhat extensive fire was discovered in the star-
board bunker overhanging the boiler room. It w as found to be located
at the bottom of the bunker under about 8 feet of fine coal, and had evi-
dently started in the wooden floor which was in a semi-charred condition
due to nearly 6 years service. The arrangements were such that the fire
could not be extinguished with steam, and the gas arose in such quantities
as to prevent workmen from handling the coal. The fire could not be
reached by water owing to the tine condition of the coal. In this emer-


THE TECHNIC.
gency a hose was lashed along a slice bar (about 9 feet long) with the
nozzle about 6 inches from the end. With two men to handle the hose and
bar and with a pressure of from 80 to 100 pounds per square inch, the bar
could be pushed through the mass of coal in any direction and to the
bottom of the bunker delivering the water immediately into the fire.
These fires were of almost daily occurrence for the following two weeks
but caused no further anxiety.
The steam machinery responded promptly to all demands made upon
it. At the close of the year this ship was selected and fitted out for pro-
longed service as the station ship at Guam in the Ladrone Islands.
Engineer Force. — The complement allowed the engine department
during the war was as follows: 1 chief engineer, 1 assistant engineer, 1
engineer's yeoman, 4 chief machinists, 3 machinists of the first class, 3
machinists of the second class, 1 boiler maker, 1 blacksmith, 1 copper-
smith, 3 water tenders, 3 oilers, 16 firemen of the first class, 16 firemen
of the second class and 18 coal passers, a total of 72 officers and men.

The second column shows the daily coal consumption for the speeds
shown in the first column. The quantities were taken from a curve
plotted from thirty points furnished by the log, and varying from a speed
of 3.8 knots to 14.8 knots per hour. The coal consumption with the main
engines at rest and with all auxiliaries in use was found to average 10.1
tons per day. Of this amount 5 tons were used for distilling water for the
ship's use. The quantity distilled averaged about 6000 gallons per day.
That not required for immediate use was stowed in reserve tanks. The
distillers were in use much of the time.

Curves of Coal Consumption per day and Steaming Radius.
Economical Speed.—The tangent OS gives the economical speed at
the point of tangency I; for at this point the ratio of coal consumption
to speed is a minimum. Therefore, for this ship the most economical
speed is about 5.5 knots. It must not be inferred, however, that such a
speed would be a proper one at which to drive the ship in regular service.
The coal consumption is only one of the items entering into the cost of
operating a ship. For example, the interest on the cost of the vessel,
taxes, insurance, depreciation and repairs, pay and messing of officers
and men, oil, waste and other supplies must all be considered. In the
merchant service, these items would aggregate not far from $250 per day;
reduced to a coal basis, coal at $2.00 per ton, this would mean 125 tons.
With this quantity a new tangent FH may be drawn, starting from a
point on the vertical axis below O, and touching the curve at G. This
would give an economical speed of about 14.3 knots per hour, which is
the speed at which the ship was operated in the merchant service.
Steaming Radius. -From the coal consumption per day at different
speeds, we may find the number of days the ship may remain at sea,

shown in column 3 of the tahle ; and the distances she may steam with a
given quantity of coal, column 5. The quantities in column 5 may be
plotted, giving the curve CDE. The ship can steam 8268 knots at 5
knots per hour, 6618 knots at 10 knots per hour, and 4320 knots at
15 knots per hour. With 1500 tons of coal, instead of 1200, these
quantities are increased 25%, making the maximum steaming radius
10335 knots.
TOWN, CITY AND VILLAGE PLATS IN MICHIGAN.
J. B. DAVIS, '68.
1. How Platted.—A village, or city; an addition to a village or city ; or
a sub-division of a parcel of land; is platted by first being surveyed, and
then divided into lots, mapped, recorded, and a copy of the record tiled
with the Auditor General at Lansing, all according to the provisions of
the statutes relating to plats and taxes, and the terms of the village or
city charter.
2. When Platted.—Such a plat must be made whenever the plan of
such lands is laid out, altered, or vacated. The work may be done by any
competent person.
3. Platted by Supervisor or Assessor.—If the proprietor lays out land
into lots, or sells by metes and bounds, and fails or neglects to have made
and recorded the plat of the same, as required by law, the supervisor
or assessor, when authorized by the township board, or common council,
or trustees, of the city, or village in which such land lies shall cause a
plat to be made under his hand and seal, and recorded and filed as above
noted. Such supervisor's or assessor's plat shall be treated as if made
by the proprietor, in respect to assessment, collection, and return of
taxes, but shall not interfere with vested rights. The town, city or village
in which the land lies shall pay for such supervisor's or assessor's plat.
4. Survey First.—The survey on the ground must precede the mapping
and record.
5. Surveys.—The first work is to ascertain the actual boundaries of
the piece of land to be platted, and to mark those boundaries by per-
manent monuments planted in the ground at all angles in them. Wit-
nesses must be recorded for all these monuments, and descriptions of the
materials used, and the character of their construction preserved, to be
entered on the sheet of paper containing the plat. The lengths of all the
lines of these boundaries, and their angles of intersection must be ascer-
tained and recorded, to be used in making the plat. These boundaries
must be connected with the lines of adjoining, or related surveys, prefer-
ably with those of the U. S. Land Survey, and records of such connections
preserved for use on the plat. It is best also to compute, by latitudes and


THE TECHNIC.
departures (or traverses), checks for the survey enclosing the land to be
platted, and prove the same to be correct before proceeding further with
the work. If there are streets, highways, railroads, canals, or any lines
of travel, or existing works, crossing, joining, bounding, or running to, or
abutting on, the land to be platted, the lines of all such must be connected
with the boundaries surveyed, and a record of such connections kept for
use on the plat, and for a guide in planning the streets and lots. It is best
to mark such lines and connections with permanent monuments, as the
boundaries are marked, taking and recording similar data for finding them
again. Similar data must be obtained for all ditches, water courses, shore
lines, and plain natural lines of demarkation, such as the edge of a marsh,
or the top or bottom edge of a steep slope or cliff, for use on the plat; for
preserving a record of these things, and for use in making the street and
lot plans. Pieces of land not to be platted, but which are embraced,
wholly, or partly, by the plat, must be surveyed, monumented, and
recorded, as completely as the land to be platted, so far as included within
the plat.
6. Field Map.—When the surveys have been carried far enough to
profitably begin mapping, make a large scale map showing the above
described information. Lay out on this map the street plan, and all lines
of travel, with public grounds and special sites, if there are to be any.
Fit the streets to connect with existing streets, or works. Fit them to the
ground as well, to give good grades, desirable lots, and proper drainage.
By this time it will be plain whe har the surveys previously made have
furnished all needed information or not. If not, they should be com-
pleted and the map perfected in accordance therewith. So complete the
plans for the streets, lines of travel, public grounds, and special sites, if
any. Fill in the lots. Get approximate dimensions, erring by being too
small. Submit the map to the proprietor. Alter it till approved by the
proprietor. Name all streets and enter their names on the map. Number
all the lots continuously over the whole map, so there will be but one lot
on the map bearing any one number. Use this map to lay out the streets,
alleys and lots by. Record thereon every angle and dimension measured
during subsequent surveys. Mark thereon every monument planted
and every lot stake driven. Fasten the map securely on a drawing board
and take it in the field when laying out the streets and lots. If it is too
large for this, have the contents of the note books copied on to it daily, or
cut it up in pieces and use them in the field -also a tracing may be made
for field use. This map should be kept in the field, while completing the
surveys.
7. Marking Plat on the Ground.—Survey out all streets, alleys, public
grounds, and special sites, in the order named. Plant a monument in the
ground at the intersection of all streets with other streets, alleys, and the
boundaries of the plat. Similarly for alleys. Murk all angles of streets,


or alleys, or points of special importance, such as the tangent points of
curves, in the same manner. Add monuments sufficient to preserve every
controling line of the work, as at the intersection of the tangents to a
curve. Record witnesses for all these monuments, to go on the paper
with the plat. Make a note on the survey map of all angles, lengths of
all lines, and location of all monuments, as soon as obtained. Survey out
the lots. Drive a lot stake at every angle in every boundary of every lot
and measure the length of every side of every lot. Mark every lot stake
on the survey map as soon as driven and record on it every dimen-
sion as soon as measured. Check all measurements of angles or distances
by a sufficient number of comparisons to verify every detail of the work.
8. Must Not Sell Lots.—The proprietor must not sell lots till the statute
is fully complied with. The penalty is ten dollars for each lot so sold.
9. Three Plats.—Three plats must be made by a competent person.
One is for the proprietor, is called the "Original," and bears on its face
the evidence that the statute has been complied with. This plat is to be
used, in a sense, somewhat as one would exhibit a deed to show title, as
it does show that the purchaser of a lot would not have a cloud on the
title to it because the statutes governing plats had not been complied with.
The second plat is for the office of the Register of Deeds for the county in
which the land lies. It is called the "Record," as it is to become the
record of the plat. The third plat is for the office of the Auditor General
at Lansing, and is called the "Copy of the Record," for such it will
become.
10. Original Plat.—The "Original" plat must be made first; sent to
the Auditor General, his approval obtained, and endorsed on its face,
and returned to the person making the same, before the other two plats
are made. The Auditor General may return the plat for correction till in
his opinion it conforms to the requirements of the statutes.
11. Paper Used, What Goes On It.—The paper for the three p1.ats must
be good cloth backed drawing paper. The sheets must be 18 by 24 inches,
a long side usually being taken for the bottom of the sheet. A margin of
one inch outside the border is sufficient. All matters and things relating
to the plat, including the description, dedication, acknowledgment,
notary's seal, and all certificates, must go on the paper with the plat, on
the same side of the sheet and within the border line. If one sheet will
not contain all the matter required by law, a sufficient number of sheets
may be used. Each sheet should then state the whole number of sheets,
and its own number in the series, as:
Whole number of sheets 7 Number of this sheet 3
The acknowledgment, cerificates, and the like, need not be repeated on
the different sheets, but the whole series be treated as if but a single
sheet.

16. Penalties.—Proprietor, ten dollars, for each lot sold before com-
plying with the statute.
Register of Deeds, ten dollars, for willfully recording a map or plat
not conforming to all the legal requirements, and in addition be held
liable to pay all damages which any person may sustain by reason thereof.
Register of Deeds, one hundred dollars, for receiving and recording a
plat without the proper tax certificate being presented with it, and further
be liable to the grantee of any instrument so recorded for the amount of
damages sustained.
17. Plat.—The plat must be a correct representation of the preceding
survey on the ground, on a scale showing not over 200 feet to the inch.
It must give the form and dimensions of every piece of land, or lot,
within it, and all angles. It must show the portion of the U. S. Land
Survey included in the ground platted, or represent that ground by
correct metes and bounds, connected with the lines of adjoining, or
related, surveys, preferably with those of the U. S. Land Survey. When
a subdivision is made of any part of a previous plat, the lot or lots, block
or blocks, or parts of said plat must be distinctly shown, and its connec-
tion and relation, with the rest of the plat, accurately designated. The
ground platted must be shown by lines and appropriate letters and
figures, so that the length and direction of ever} side of every piece is
plain from the plat, without reference to the written description. Mark
the starting point of the written description on the plat with the words,
"Place of Beginning."
All public grounds and special sites, except streets and alleys, ninst


13
be plainly represented, and show the exact extent of the same by exhibit-
ing the lengths and directions of all their boundaries.
All streets and alleys are to be shown by their courses, lengths, widths
and names, or numbers, by writing, lettering, and figures on the plat.
Show the exact location of every monument by a small plain circle
for each one, with its center at the point marked on the ground by the
monument.
All lots must be shown and numbered as directed in 6. The plat must
give every dimension of every boundary of every lot. If there are many
lots having the same dimensions, the same dimensions need not be unnec-
essarily repeated, but be indicated by two marks each, if this can be done
without leaving any uncertainty as to any dimension of any lot. Especial
pains must be taken to show clearly every dimension, the true form, and
the certain location and extent of all lots of an unusual or irregular shape,
such as those lying between streets not parallel, or meeting at an oblique
angle; or lots purposely made irregular to avoid had angles for buildings
between such streets ; or lots bounded by curves, or bordering on a railroad
curve; or those lying along bodies of water, such as ponds, lakes and
streams, or in similar situations. If a lot has a curved boundary, the
radius of the curve and the location of its center must be shown as well as
the actual length of the curved boundary measured in a designated num-
ber of chords. It is well also to give the central angle of such curve as
it is not apparent from the other lines and angles on the plat.
Every angle must be shown on the plat, or the course of every line
on it. This includes the angles at all the boundaries of the land platted,
and their connections with adjoining surveys, whether of lands, streets,
highways, railroads, canals, or what not. In the case of streets and
alleys all angles must appear at every intersection with other streets or
alleys, and where any or either of them intersect the boundaries of the
plat or the adjoining surveys. If curves are used the central angle for
each one must be recorded on the plat, with the correct location of its
center, its radius, its length, measured in a given number of chords,
which must he stated, and the positions of its tangents plainly represented,
with their length. In all lots, whether regular or otherwise, unless the
angles of their boundaries can be readily discerned from the data on the
neighboring lines, said angles must be recorded on said lots in their
proper places. If deflection angles are used in the "Description " of the
land platted, these should be shown on the plat by prolonging the
boundary lines with a broken or dotted line, and writing them in where
they belong, so they will appear in due order and direction, as one reads
the description and compares it with the plat.
Pieces of land not platted, but embraced, wholly, or partly, iu the
survey for the plat, must be distinctly shown on the plat with the same
data for exact location, extent, form, dimensions, and connection with


THE TECHNIC.
adjacent lands, that is recorded for the land that is platted. These pieces
should be surrounded by a somewhat broader line than is generally used
elsewhere on the plat, and they must be plainly lettered: "Not Included
in this Plat."
The drawing should be done in black. Colored lines fade. The lines
should be plain and strong. The monument lines of the streets and
alleys should be drawn finer, and dotted, or broken, but plain. The
street widths should be noted in plain figures, showing the distance from
the monument line, each way to the property lines. Shade lines may he
used with good effect by inking the north and the east property lines on
blocks with distinctly broader line.. Any representations of buildings,
railroads, bridges, or structures of any kind, though very seldom neces-
sary, or topographical signs, should be neatly and plainly done. Line
shading, occasionally useful, should be made sufficiently open to permit
of its being uniformly well done with fine (not ragged) lines.
All lettering on the plat itself should be plain and simple as it can be
made, and no more prominent than the plat itself, to which it is subor-
dinate. This refers to the lettering in streets, alleys, public grounds,
special sites, excepted lands, and the like. The plat is made for the pur-
pose of conveying legal information regarding the survey made on the
ground, and everything on it should be an aid in doing this. Lettering,
nor anything else can take the place of a plat, and ought not to be allowed
to obscure the plat. Put on the lettering last, but have a regard for it
while planning the rest of the work.
Lot stakes may be indicated on the plat by small round dots, made
with a close set bow pen.
18. Title.—The Title to be used varies somewhat with circumstances,
but must always contain the name of the township, city, or village, and
State, in which the land platted lies; the name of the plat; and any
other words, or numbers, required to distinctly distinguish it from any,
and every other plat in the State. If the plat is a first one, made to
locate and subdivide into lots, the land for any city or village, the title
should include the full name of such city, or village, the county in which
it is situated, and the name of the State. If the plat is an addition,
extending the platted area of any city, or village, the title should include
the name of such addition, with that of the city, or village, and the State.
If the plat is a subdivision of lands already platted, the title should give
the name of the subdivision, the designation of the lots, or lands, sub-
divided, the name of the previous plat, or plats, the name of the city, or
village, and the State. If a plat is the re pi at of certain lots, or lands,
of a former plat, call it a subdivision, and give it a corresponding title.
If a plat covers ground not part of any former plat, while yet well within
the city, or village, boundaries; or land entirely without those bounda-
ries; or any laud to which a distinctive name may appropriately be


attached, it is better to give it such a name in the title, and add, as a
sub-title the name of the city, or village, and State. These typical cases
may be sufficient to suggest the proper, form of title, and the words to
be used, in any case.
The lettering used should be fully subordinated to the purposes of
the plat, and not overshadow the rest of the work on the sheet, or sheets.
If more than one sheet is used, the title must be repeated on every
sheet.
19. Scale.—A scale must be drawn on the sheet with the plat,
correctly representing the linear measurements on the plat. A plain,
nest form of scale diagram should be used, to which should be added a
statement of the scale in feet to the inch.
20. Meridian Mark.—There must be drawn on the sheet with the plat,
a meridian mark showing plainly, by the use of letters, in a general way,
all of the four cardinal points of the compass. The design should be
simple and useful, not too large, and never obtrusive in its prominence.
31. Explanations.—Explanations of certain matters not otherwise
perfectly plain on the plat, may be needed. These should always state
the unit of linear measurement, as "Dimensions in feet" or " Dimensions
in chains." But one unit of measurement should be used. Representa-
tions of certain things should be exhibited with explanations, such as
monuments, lot stakes, or any special signs used. There should be a
sketch made showing the general method of placing and constructing
monuments, and the manner of using the materials of which they are
made. No doubt of the signification of anything whatever on the plat
should be permitted to remain unexplained. Many things quite plain to
a surveyor, or draftsman, are not understood by people in general, or may
be made the subject of question by design.
22. Description.—A description of the land platted must be written
on the sheet containing the plat. If more than one sheet is used the
description need not be written but once. It must be full and detailed;
give the township, range, and section of the U. S. Land Survey, in which
the land is situated; and the name of the town, city, village, or addition,
platted. It should be complete in itself, needing no reference to the plat
for a competent person to locate the land on the ground. Verbosity and
repetitions are to be carefully avoided. The land should be described but
once. That is, no unnecessary words should be used, and but one inter-
pretation to those that are used should be practicable. If subdivisions
ot a section, by the U. S. Land Laws, are embraced in the plat the regu-
lar description commonly applied to such must be used. If metes and
bounds are used, the connection with monuments and lines of the U. S.
Land Survey should be given whenever practicable, otherwise, connec-
tions and references to adjoining surveys, former surveys, and records,
sufficient to unmistakably designate the land. To connect the descrip-


THE TECHNIC.
tion with the plat, reference to it should be made by capital letters
referring to the same letters on the plat, as "A to B," "C to D." Lands
not included in the plat but lying within the boundaries thereof should
be noted in the description, as excepted. If the description includes any
part of a highway or other line of travel, or any lands subject to any
kind of an easement, the facts, as far as can be, should be stated in the
description. Stump writing is suitable for entering the description on
the paper. The matter should be neatly arranged. When practicable, the
data for each side should occupy a separate entry, the entries being num-
bered in order. The description should begin, as follows:
DESCRIPTION OP LAND PLATTED.
The land embraced in the annexed plat of
is described as follows:
i.
23. Monuments.—Monuments must not only be represented on the
plat, as noted in 17,, and explained and illustrated, as noted in 21, but
the witnesses for them, taken during the survey, when permanent objects
were found in their vicinity, must be recorded on the paper with the plat,
together with any other information that will assist in finding, or restor-
ing them. A systematic form of record should be used.
24. Surveyor's Certificate.—The surveyor, or engineer, or competent
person acting as such, must certify that the plat is a correct one, and that
the monuments described in it have been planted as therein described.
The following is the customary form:
surveyor's certificate.
I herebj' certify that the plat herein delineated is a correct one and
that permanent monuments consisting of
have been planted at points marked
thus as thereon shown at all angles in the boundaries of the land
platted, and at all the intersections of streets, or streets and alleys.
Surveyor.
25. Council or Board Certificate.—In order to comply with the general
law incorporating cities and villages; the provisions of the charter of any
city or village ; or the requirements of any township board, village trustees,
city council, or other body having the rightful oversight of the plat, it
may be necessary, to include a certificate of approval by such body.
This certificate might be of the form below:
CERTIFICATE OF APPROVAL.
I?y
This plat was examined and approved at a


meeting of the
the day of 19
Clerk.
26. Tax Certificate.—The .Register of Deeds shall require from the
person presenting the plat for record a certificate from the Auditor Gen-
eral or from the county treasurer of the county, whether there are any
tax lines or titles held by the State, or by any individual, against any of
the land embraced in the plat, and that all taxes due thereon have been
paid for the five years preceding to the date of such plat, and in default
of the presentation of such certificate he shall not record the plat until
such certificate is secured and presented. The Register of Deeds shall
note the fact on the plat that said certificate has, or has not, been pre-
sented to him when the plat is presented for record, and in case the
person presenting such plat shall refuse to procure such certificate, he
shall endorse that fact upon said plat over his official signature, and shall
refuse to receive and record the same.
The statement of taxes furnished by county treasurers is considered
sufficient to comply with the law, but few calls being made on the Audi-
tor General for the purpose. It is suggested that the form used by the
county treasurer be copied directly on to the plats. One of these forms
is as follows:
TAX CERTIFICATE.
County Treasurer's Office, )
County, Mich.}-
Mich 19—)
It is hereby certified that the following statement shows the condition
of Lands described below in the County of so far as
relates to the State and County taxes prior to the day of
19 , to-wit:
[Description of Lands.]
as appears by the records of this office.
[State Delinquent Taxes, If any, during Ave years prior to date of plat.]
County Treasurer.
Obtain the treasurer's certificate and copy it on to the plat to save
space that might be wasted if an attempt was made to allow for items
2


THE TECHNIC.
not yet known. Below the tax certificate, add for signature by register
the following words:
Above Tax Certificate was presented with this plat.
Register of Deeds for said County.
In certain cases no tax certificate is required.
1. Plat for incorporation of a city or village, if it is part or all of a
plat already on record, or in so far as the description is not changed.
2. Copy of a lost or destroyed plat.
3. Sheriff's or Commissioner's deeds given under law or decree of a
court of this State.
4. Deed of Trust by an assignee, executor, or corporation, given pur-
suant to State law.
5. Deeds without a warranty.
6. Land Patents, U. S. or State.
7. Tax Deeds of Auditor General.
8. Deed of a railroad company conveying its right of way, if accom-
panied by certificate of Auditor General that all specific taxes due from
said railroad company are paid, including the year the deed is executed.
For the penalty see 16.
27. Dedication.—The dedication should be in the following form, some-
what varied in particular statements to suit particular circumstances.
It must contain the name, or names, of the proprietor, or proprietors, and
their wives, and must be signed by all those whose names are mentioned,
and these signatures verified by two witnesses the same as for deeds. In
case the proprietor is a bachelor or widower, this fact should be stated to
account for the absence of the signature of the wife. If there are several
proprietors, with, or without wives, the names of all'may be included in
the one dedication, in an orderly manner, mentioning the wives, if any,
even though their signatures must be obtained in different places, or in
other states. If the signatures of all parties can be obtained at the same
time and place, spaces for two witnesses will be enough, otherwise there
should be two spaces for signatures of witnesses for each signing, accom-
panied by a statement of whose signatures each pair of witnesses are to
verify. Every man and his wife who may be in any manner concerned
iu contributing land for the purposes of the plat should sign the dedica-
tion. This is sometimes overlooked in the matter of opening streets or parts
of streets, or in relation to some small strip or parcel of land taken for the
plat. Particular attention should be given to obtaining the signatures of
all parties concerned, in exactly the same manner as if making a deed for
the land embraced in the plat.
DEDICATION.
Know all men by these presents, that we
as proprietor, and


l9
his wife, have caused the land embraced in the annexed plat
to be surveyed, laid out and platted, to be known as
[Insert title of Plat.]
and that the streets and alleys as shown on said plat are hereby dedicated
to the use of the public.
Signed and sealed in the presence of [l.s.]
[L.8.]
28. Acknowledgement.—Plats must be acknowledged as deeds are
acknowledged. This calls for a form of acknowledgment similar to that
used in deeds to follow the Dedication on the plat. The following is the
usual form.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.
State of Michigan,
County of
On this day of 190 before
me, a Notary Public in and for said county, personally came the above
named and
his wife, known to me to be the persons who executed the above dedica-
tion and acknowledged the same to be their free act and deed.
Notary Public Co., Mich.
The above wording may be changed to designate any other proper
person before whom deeds, and consequently plats, may be acknowledged.
The above wording may be changed to designate the proprietors whoever
they are. They may all be named and their acknowledgements all taken
at one time and before the same official. If the plat has to be sent to
different places to get the signatures of the different proprietors there
must be as many forms of acknowledgement provided on the plat as there
are to be persons before whom the acknowledgements are to be made,
each one containing the designation of the proper official before whom it is
to be made and the names of those who are to make it. If the plat is to
be sent out of this state for signatures and acknowledgements, it is better
to name some official of the state to which it is to be sent, whose position
and seal is legally known in Michigan, as this will save attaching to the
plats sealed certificates from proper authorities to establish the official
position of the person taking the acknowledgement,—as would be the case
for a Notary Public. The surveyor should take the advice of the Auditor
General, or of an attorney in this matter.
29. Seals.—Places for the seals should be left just within the border
line, so they can be reached with the stamp. Strike a two inch circle
with a pencil and write, in pencil, within it the words "Seal here." These
pencil marks can be erased when the plat is returned. There must be a


THE TECHNIC.
place to seal every form of acknowledgement, adjacent to it. This will
require some planning when getting ready for the plat, in order to briny
them all next to the border line.
30. Auditor General's Certificate.—The certificate of approval by the
Auditor General will be furnished by hini, but a small space for it should
be left, about one by two inches. The proper place for this space , is
following the Acknowledgement and Seal.
31. Certificate of Record.—The certificate of record should be of the
ordinary form found on the back of deeds, such as the following:
CERTIFICATE OF KECORD.
Register's Office, 1
County J 88:
Received for Record the day of 19
at o'clock M., and Recorded in Liber of Plats, on Page
Register.
32. Record.—After the original plat is returned from the Auditor Gen-
eral bearing the certificate of his approval the other two copies are to be
prepared. They may be made by any competent person. The first is the
record and must contain everything entered at this time on the original,
and in addition the certificate of comparison with the original, in the
following form:
CERTIFICATE OF COMPARISON WITH THE ORIGINAL.
State of Michigan,)
County of j 88:
We Register of Deeds in and for
said county, and of Surveyor,
hereby certify that we have each carefully compared this copy with the
original plat of [Title of Plat]
and that it is an exact copy thereof and of the whole of such original map
or plat. Register of Deeds.
Surveyor.
This certificate may be signed at different times, and places, by the
Register of Deeds and Surveyor, and comparisons may be separately
made. The most convenient method of comparison is to take the three
finished plats to the Register of Deeds, give one to each of three qualified
persons, let the original be read aloud, and the other two compared with
it at once.
33. Copy of Record.—The copy of the record should be next prepared.
This must contain everything entered on the first copy, and in addition
the following certificate of comparison with the record.

35. Inspections and Duties.—Look overall the sheets carefully in every
detail and take particular pains to make sure there are no errors, or
omissions, and that the plats are true duplicates. Take, or send them,
with the tax certificate to the Register of Deeds of the county in which
the laud platted lies, and complete the comparisons and signatures called
for by 32 and 33. The Original and Copy of the Record with the tax cer-
tificate should be returned to the person who made them, that is, to the
'surveyor. He should examine the sheets and see that the part of the
Register of Deeds has been properly performed. The tax certificate should
be preserved with the Original Plat. Wrap the Copy of the Record
and mail it, with a letter, stating the address of sender, and enclosing
the fee of one dollar, to the Auditor General at Lansing, Michigan.
When his receipt for the Copy of the Record, and fee, is received, attach
it to the Original Plat. Return the Original Plat, with receipt attached,
and tax certificate to the owner of the property. The sales of lots may
then properly begin.
36. Legal Questions.—The outline here presented covers the simpler
operations. Legal questions continually arise which are beyond the pro-
vince of the surveyor. These questions, when comprehended as fully as
practicable, should be submitted to the Auditor General for his direction.
What form of dedication and acknowledgement should be used when the
proprietor is a corporation; or an estate; or a number of heirs; or in
case the land is to be platted by supervisors or an assessor? Such
inquiries should be submitted to the Auditor General. In many other
matters the Auditor General is the best guide the surveyor can have,
as he is the official designated by law to see the provisions relating to
plats carried out. Such consultations lead to more uniformity in practice
in various parts of the State. It is the surveyor's plain duty to faithfully
endeavor to carry out, or comply with, the instructions of the Auditor
General.
37. Detached Parcels.—Detached parcels of land cannot be included


23
in one plat, but separate plats must be prepared for each. Two plats
cannot be shown on the same sheet. Separate sheets must be used for
the separate plats. Adjoining lauds owned by different persons may be
included in one plat, all the owners, and their wives, joining in the dedi-
cation and acknowledgment. It is not necessary to designate the parts
owned by each person.
38. Date.—The date of a plat is the date of the Auditor General's
receipt for the Copy of the Record and the fee, as on this date compli-
ance with the plat law was completed.
39. Signature.—A signature must be made by the person whose sig-
nature it purports to be in the same manner as is required in deeds. In
case the signer cannot write there must be the proper " Mark " witness-
ing with space left for same on sheet. A rubber stamp is not a signa-
ture, neither can an)' other device be used. With a pen and ink is the
only proper signature made, as if making a deed of the land, and by the
proprietor or wife in person.
40. Duties of Register.—The copy of the Plat which becomes the
Record is to be fastened securely by the Register of Deeds in a strongly
bound book, furnished by the county to receive 18-inch by 24-inch sheets
without folding. The surveyor should observe that this is done. This
copy then becomes a record the same as if transcribed by the Register.
The Register must fill out the certificate of record on the original, as to
time, book, and page, the same as for a deed. He must note the time on
the record, but to make all three plats alike, the certificate of record had
better be used throughout. This will also make the copy of the record
show where it is recorded as well as when. The Register must keep an
alphabetical index to plats. After a proper delay, it is well for the sur-
veyor to see that the plat is properly indexed, if convenient for him to
do so. The Register's fee is two dollars, is to be paid by the proprietor,
and is in full for all services rendered.
41. Duties of Auditor General.—The copy of the record must be deliv-
ered to the Auditor General at Lansing, after being compared with the
record and certified by the register and surveyor. He shall file this copy
in his office, and shall keep an alphabetical index of plats, with any
other aids for reference. His fee is one dollar, to be paid by the person
delivering the copy.
42. Prima Facie Evidence.—The Original Plat with the certificate of
re.cord on it, or the Record, made as per 40, or a certified transcript of the
Record shall be, in courts of this State, prima facie evidence of making
and recording such plat in conformity to the statute. The Copy of the
Record in the Auditor General's office, or a certified transcript thereof
shall be, in courts of this State, prima facie evidence of the above matters
and also the filing of said copy in the Auditor General's oflice.
43. Fee of Public Grounds.—A plat legally made and recorded shall be


THE TF.CHNIC.
deemed a sufficient conveyance to vest the fee of the lands designated for
public use in the township, village, or city, in which they lie. in trust for
the purposes designated, and for no other purpose.
44. Notice.—In making the surveys, collecting data, and making the
plat, the surveyor should notice that Section 1474 of the plat law is to he
considered in connection with the fifth clause of Section 1473.
45. Plat Law.—The following is the copy of the statutes relating to
the making, and recording of plats. It should be studied line by line and
word by word.
PLAT LAW.
(§1473) Section I. Whenever any town, city, village or addition
thereto, shall be laid out, or shall be altered or vacated as hereinafter pro-
vided, within this Stiite, the proprietor or proprietors thereof shall cause
a true map or plat thereof to be made by a civil engineer, surveyor or
other competent person. Such map or plat shall in every case be made
on a scale showing not more than two hundred feet to an inch, on sheets
of good muslin-backed paper, eighteen inches by twenty-four inches in
size. There shall be written upon the paper on which said map or plat
shall be made, a full and detailed description of the land embraced in said
map or plat, showing the township and range in which such land is situated,
and the sections and parts of sections platted, and containing the name of
the town, city, village or addition platted, the name or names of the pro-
prietor or proprietors thereof, and of the engineer, surveyor, or person
making said map or plat, with the date. The same shall be signed by
such proprietor or proprietors and their wives, and engineer, surveyor or
person making the same, and shall be witnessed and acknowledged by
the owners as deeds conveying land are required to be witnessed and
acknowledged. The sections and parts of sections platted shall also be
designated by lines drawn upon said map or plat, with appropriate letters
and figures, and in case of a subdivision of lots or blocks of a previous
survey, the outlines of the original or previous lots or blocks so subdivided
shall be designated by lines drawn upon said map or plat, and shall be
marked with appropriate letters and figures. There shall also be on such
map or plat a plain designation of the cardinal points, and a correct scale.
Such map or plat shall be recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds
for the county in which the land is platted is situated. Before such plat
shall be recorded, and before any copies are made therefrom, the person
making the same shall forward the original plat to the Auditor General of
the State, who shall approve of the same whenever such plat shall con-
form, in his opinion, to the requirements of this act, and shall return the
plat to the person who forwarded it, with his approval endorsed thereon.
For the purpose of such recording the said proprietor or proprietors shall
cause to be made by a civil engineer, surveyor or other competent person,
on the same scale, and 011 paper of the same size and quality as that on


25
which the original map or plat is required to be made, an exact copy of
said original map or plat with the detailed description, signatures, wit-
nesses, acknowledgement and endorsement of approval as above specified.
When such map or plat shall conform, or shall be made to conform, in all
respects to the requirements of this act, the said register, and said
engineer, surveyor, or person who made the same, shall each carefully
compare said qopy with said original map or plat, and if correct, or when
made correct, it shall be certified by the said register and said engineer,
surveyor, or person who made the same, who shall certify that they have
carefully compared the same with said map or plat, describing it, and that
it is an exact copy thereof and of the whole of such original map or plat.
The said register shall then securely fasten the said copy in a book of the
proper size for such paper, so that it shall not be folded, which book shall
be strongly bound in leather and provided at the expense of the said
county, and such copy, so fastened in said book, shall be held and taken
to be a record of said map or plat, with like effect as if said map or plat
had been actually transcribed by said register in a book in his office; but
in no case shall any such map or plat be recorded until it shall be made
to conform to all the requirements of this act, nor until such duplicate
shall be an exact duplicate of said original map or plat as approved by the
Auditor General, and for any willful violation of this provision by a
Register of Deeds, he shall be liable to a penalty of ten dollars, and shall
also be liable to pay all damages which any person may sustain by reason
thereof, to be recovered in an action of trespass on the case. The register
shall certify on such map or plat the time when it was recorded as afore-
said, with a reference to the book or page where recorded. He shall note
on the record the time when made, and shall keep a separate index of
maps or plats, in which he shall enter alphabetically, the name of every
town, city, village, or addition, the map or plat of which shall be recorded
by him, with a reference to the book and page where the same shall be
recorded. There shall be made a true copy of the record of such map or
plat so recorded, on paper of the same quality and size as above pre-
scribed and on the same scale, which copy shall be certified by the said
register and engineer, surveyor, or person making the same, who shall
certify that they have each carefully compared the same with the record,
and that it is a true transcript therefrom, and of the whole of such record.
Such copy so certified shall then be delivered to the Auditor General
of this State, who shall file the same in his office. The Auditor General
shall keep an index in which he shall enter, alphabetically, the name of
every town, city, village, and addition, a copy of the record of the map or
plat of which shall be filed in his office, the date of filing the same, and
whatever else he may think necessary to facilitate reference thereto. On
delivering such copy to the Auditor General, the person delivering it
shall pay into the state treasury, to the credit of the general fund, the sum


THE TECHNIC.
of one dollar. The original map or plat, with the certificate of record
endorsed thereon, the record thereof made as aforesaid, or a properly cer-
tified transcript of such record shall be received in all courts of this state
as prima facie evidence of the making and recording of such map or plat
in conformity with the provisions of this act, and the copy of such recorded
map or plat filed in the Auditor General's office, or a properly certified
transcript thereof, shall be received in all courts of this state as prima facie
evidence of the above matters, and also the filing of said copy in the Aud-
ditor General's office. If any person or persons shall sell any lot or lots
within any such town, city, village, or addition, before the map or plat
thereof shall be recorded and the copy of the record thereof filed as afore-
said, he or they shall forfeit and pay the sum of ten dollars for each lot so
sold. For all services by this act required to be performed by a Register
of Deeds in respect to any such map or plat brought into his office for
record, the said register shall be entitled to receive the sum of two dollars,
which shall be paid by the proprietor or proprietors of the ground platted:
Provided, That in all cases where the proprietor or proprietors of any
piece or pieces of land shall have caused the same to be laid out and
platted as a city, town or village, or as an addition to a city, town, or vil-
lage, or where the proprietors have caused such city, town or village lots
to be deeded by metes amd bounds and courses, and have failed or neg-
lected to have a plat thereof made and recorded in the office of the Regis-
ter of Deeds of the county in which such land is situated, the surveyor or
assessor of the township, city or village in which such land is situated
shall, when authorized by the township board of such township, or by the
common council or board of trustees of such city or village, cause a map
or plat of said city, town, village, or addition to be made under his hand
and seal, properly acknowledged by him, and showing by reference to
this act the authority for the same, and have the same properly recorded in
the office of the Register of said Deeds, and filed in the Auditor General's
office, as hereinbefore provided, and such plat or map when so recorded
and filed, shall be treated in respect to the assessment, collection and
return of taxes, and the sale of said lands for delinquent taxes, as if the
same had been made by the proprietor or proprietors: Provided, That
such proceedings shall not interfere with vested rights: Provided further,
That the expense of making said plat or map when done by the supervisor
or assessor according to the provisions of this act, shall be paid by the
township, city, or village in which such plat is located.
(§1474) Sec. 2. That such maps or plats as are by this act required
to be recorded, shall particularly set forth and describe such portion of
the government survey as is intended to be platted, and when said prem-
ises are not included in the legal subdivisions of the government surveys,
then the boundaries to be defined by metes and bounds and courses.
Said maps or plats shall also particularly set forth and describe all the


27
public grounds, except for streets and alleys, by their boundaries, courses
and extent, and all streets and alleys by their courses, lengths, widths,
names or numbers by writing or figures upon that portion of the map or
plat intended for those uses. And all the lots intended for sale may be
numbered, either by progressive numbers, or if in blocks, progressively
numbered in each block, and the blocks progressively numbered or lettered.
Where all the lots of any block are of the same dimensions, it shall be
sufficient to mark the precise length and width upon one tier thereof; but
all gores, triangles, or other lots, which are not either squares or paral-
lelograms, shall have the length of their sides plainly defined by figures.
Permanent monuments shall be located in the ground at all angles in
the boundaries of the land platted, and at all the intersections of streets, or
streets and alleys, as shown on the map or plat, and when there are perm-
anent objects in the vicinity of such monuments the bearings and dis-

A REDETERMINATION OF THE ELECTRO-CHEMICAL
EQUIVALENT OF SILVER.1
K. B. GUTIIE.
At the International Congress of Electricians in Chicago, 1893, a new
system of practical electrical units was proposed by the chamber of
delegates and unanimously accepted. In the following year these unit
were made legal by Act of Congress. By tins system an ampere is defined
as that current which, when passed through a solution of nitrate of silver
in water deposits silver at the rate of 0.001118 gramme per second. Certain
specifications with respect to the solution and the material, size and
shape of the electrodes must be followed. This definition of the ampOre
is founded on the fundamental units of length, mass and time and was
intended to be one-tenth of the absolute unit of current.
One of the most interesting problems presenting itself is the determin-
ation of the mechanical equivalent of heat by measuring the heat effect of

Electro-Dynamometer Used in Redetermination of the Electro Chemical
Equivalent of Silver.

a current, i. e. h = C2Rt. Accurate experiments of this kind were under-
taken in 1893 by Griffith1 and in 1895 by Schuster and Gannon2, but these
physicists found that the value of the mechanical equivalent of heat as
measured by the electrical method exceeded, by about one-ninth percent,
that which Rowland had previously found in his classical experiments by
direct conversion of mechanical into heat energy3.
To explain this discrepancy a great deal of labor and time was spent
by the comparison of the thermometers used in the different investigations
and the conclusion, finally arrived at, was that the discrepancy is not one
of thermometry, but is rather due to an error in the standards used.4
That it was considered of great importance to settle the question is shown
by the fact that the English Association in 1897 appointed a committee on
standards which was to redetermine the accurate value of the unit of
current. This committee received last summer a large appropriation for
the building of a new current-balance for this purpose. The American
Association for the Advancement of Science appointed a similar committee,
as secretary of which Professor Carhart was elected. He secured for us a
grant from the Association and helped us from the beginning by his advice
and the great interest he showed in the progress of the investigation.
Professor Patterson proposed in the fall of 1897 a new method for
measuring the electro-chemical equivalent of silver and kindly asked the
writer to join forces with him in the practical working out of his idea.
The method differs in important points from those employed heretofore.
In all former determinations only two types of instruments were used, the
current-balance and the tangent-galvanometer. In the former the final
values depend upon the accurate knowledge of the acceleration due to
gravity, in the latter on that of the horizontal component of the earth's
magnetic field. Lord Rayleigh and Mrs. Sidgwick5 found by the former
method 0.00111794 grm. and Fr. and W. Kohlrausch6 by the latter
0.0011183 grm. for the electro-chemical equivalent of silver. In spite of the
close agreement of these two values later experimenters arrived at less
concordant results. Pellat and Potier' in France found 0.0011193 grm.,
Koepsel* in Germany, 0.0011174 grm., and finally Kahle9 at the Imperial
Physical Institute at Berlin 0.0011183 grm., using the same instrument as
the former observer, i. e. a very accurate current-balance.
Our plan was to make ourselves entirely independent of g or H by
balancing the moment of the movable coil of an absolute electro-dyna-
mometer due to the electro-dynamic action between the two coils against
the torsional moment of the suspending wire, when twisted through a
certain angle. By this method we reduced the measurements necessary

THE TECHNIC.
for the determination of the ampere directly to measurements of the
fundamental units.
The wooden frame of the fixed coil of the electro-dynamometer was
constructed in the machine-shops of the University and the instrument
completed by our former mechanician, R. H. Miller. The fixed coil con-
sists of 576 turns of copper wire in a single layer and has a mean length
of 41.633 cms. and a mean diameter of 48.116 cms.; the movable coil of
8.805 cms. mean length and 10.0187 cms. mean diameter, has 45 turns of a
flat copper strip wound on a hard rubber cylinder which was suspended at
the center of the fixed coil by a single phosphor-bronze wire 0.0355 cm. in
diameter and 100.5 cms. long. The dimensions of the electrodynamometer
were selected in such a way that it was relatively easy to calculate the
electromagnetic effect of the two coils upon one another when a current is
flowing through them. The current went through the two coils in series
and was led into the movable coil through two mercury cups below and
in line with the suspension. The lead wires from the terminals of the
fixed coil were carried along the surface, parallel to the axis, to binding
posts at diagonally opposite corners of a square and the lead wires from
the suspended coil were brought out to the other corners of this square.
The error due to a small asymmetry was eliminated by reversing the cur-
rent in the fixed coil. The suspending wire was soldered into small brass
cylinders at both ends, the clamping of the wire being done by means of
these so that the length of the wire remained constant throughout the
experiment. Of greatest importance was the fact that the wire showed
only a very slight elastic fatigue, whose influence we were able to elimin-
ate almost entirely.
The whole investigation was naturally divided into two main parts.
(1) The determination of the torsional coefficient of the suspending
phosphor-bronze wire;
(2) The measurement of a current in terms of the silver deposited
by it.
(1) In the first case we had to make a large number of determinations
of the period of the wire when a brass cylinder of known dimensions and
weight was suspended by it, being held firmly by one of the small
cylinders soldered permanently to the ends of the wire. The weight
equalled very nearly that of the suspended coil of the electrodynamometer
so that the wire was under the same stress as well during this part of the
investigation as during the second. The time of vibration which was
found by the method which is in common use in our laboratory, is
practically a linear function of the temperature, varying from 11.9679
seconds at 20.19° to 11.9851 seconds at 26.89° 0. The logarithmic decre-
ment was found to be extremely small. All these measurements were
taken with the system in a vacuum tube so as to eliminate the possible
error due to friction in air.


31
From these determinations and the dimensions of the coils we obtain
by calculation as the theoretical value of the current necessary to balance
the torsional moment due to a twist of 2t, of the wire at the temperature
27°,
I = 0.95158 ampere.
(2) Since the instrument was so sensitive that it was impossible to
keep the current constant at the value necessary for a balance, we had to
divide this part of the work into two distinct subdivisions. First, we
found by Poggendorff's Potentiometer method the ratio between the E.
M. F. of two Standard Cells immersed in a large water-bath and the
potential difference at the terminals of a coil of manganin wire, when a
current flowed through it, which just balanced the torsional moment of
the suspending wire of the electrodynamometer due to one complete twist
of the torsion head.
Let I be the calculated theoretical value of the current,
E the E. M. F. of the Standard Cells,
Ri the resistance necessary to balance E,
R2 the resistance necessary to balance the Pot. Diflf. due to I,
E the resistance of the manganin coil,
then
- R2 E
Ri R
Secondly, by the same method the E. M. F. of the cells was balanced
against the Pot. Diff. over the manganin resistance due to the silver
depositing current.
Let I1 be this current,
Ri1 and R21 the resistance necessary for the balances,
E and R the same as before,
then

Ri1 R
The silver deposited by the current I1 is
q = z I1 t grammes,
where z is the electro-chemical equivalent of silver,

We can thus determine the electro-chemical equivalent of silver with-
out knowing the absolute value of the E. M. F. of the cells or the absolute
resistance of the manganin coil, the only necessary condition being that
the resistance boxes used for obtaining the balances were well calibrated

relatively. By a number of independent experiments we found as the
value of the electro-chemical equivalent of silver
0.0011192 gramme per amptre per second,
a value somewhat larger than the accepted. Kahle's results, though
somewhat smaller, would give 0.0011190 gramme, if his silver nitrate
solution had been treated the same way as ours. The silver deposit from
a silver nitrate solution varies indeed according to the previous treatment
of the solution and on the conditions of the kathode. Our value seems to
show that the accented value of the unit of electric current is a little too
small ;so here we have found a satisfactory explanation for the discrepancies
found for the mechanical equivalent of heat, alluded to above:
The E. M. F. of the Clark cell is a much better standard than the
silver voltameter, since it has a very constant value. It would have been
easy to determine its E. M. F. directly, had we known the actual resist-
ance of the manganin coil. A simple calculation, using Glazebrook's
value, which is based on the electro-chemical equivalent of silver =
0.001118 grm. gives us for the E. M. F. of the Clark cell 14SJ7 volts at
15° C, while Kahle found 1.4328 volts. The American Association granted
a second appropriation for the continuation of the work. Two standard
resistances from the Imperial Physical Institute at Berlin are now on
their way here, and Professor Carhart has made two standard Claik cells,
according to legal specifications. He and the writer intend to follow out
the work described above by determining directly the E. M. F. of the
legal form of the Clark cell.
USE OF ELECTRICITY IN A GAS PLANT.
H. G. FIELD, '93.
At first thought it might well be treated as a joke to suggest the use
of electric lights to illuminate the works of a gas generating and supply
company.
On the contrary, electric lighting may be used in such a plant to
great advantage. The writer has recently planned and supervised the
installation of a small electric plant for lighting the works at Station A,
of the Detroit City Gas Company. A brief description of this equipment
and its special utility may prove interesting.
The dynamo is a Crocker-Wheeler bi-polar belted machine with a
rated capacity of forty amperes at one hundred and twenty-five volts.
It is driven by a White &amp; Middleton gas engine, rated at nine brake
horse power. This engine furnishes power from its main belt pulley to
drive a line shaft, from which are belted various machines, such as drill
presses, lathes and blowers for general shop and forge purposes. An


33
auxiliary belt pulley is bolted to the other fly wheel to drive a counter
shaft, from which the dynamo is belted. The counter shaft is provided
with tight and loose pulleys to allow the dynamo to be run or remain idle
as desired. A fly wheel is attached to this counter shaft to assist in
maintaining the dynamo at constant speed.
The marble switchboard contains an ammeter and a voltmeter of the
Weston round pattern, afield rheostat for dynamo, a Fisher single pole
vertical opeiating circuit breaker, voltmeter and ground detector switches,
pilot and instrument lamps, anJ switches for controlling the various
feeders, all protected by fuses.
The buildings and portions of the grounds lighted are principally
such as would prove dangerous on account of possible explosions if
lighted by gas or exposed to flame. The feeders run mainly outside of the
buildings, and supply current at various distributing centers to a total of
about one hundred lamps, of from four to thirty-two candle power. At
the centers of distribution are cabinets which contain cut-outs with fuses
to protect the various circuits. Especial care was taken to carefully seal
all openings leading from these cut-out cabinets into rooms where danger
might arise from gas explosion resulting from the blowing of a fuse, and
these cabinets are ventilated into the open air.
The dangerous departments include the Pintsch compressor room
and tank house; the natural, coal and water gas purifier cellars, and
ground floor rooms, and the ammonia room. To avoid sparks in these
rooms, keyless sockets are used and the lights are operated by switches
outside, either provided with special waterproof boxes, or placed inside of
cabinets.
The inside wiring is mostly of the exposed or open character, except
where subject to injury by employes, in which cases molding is used to
protect the wires.
Long extension cords with rubber, jute and cotton covering, and
provided with waterproof sockets and heavy lamp guards, are used for
portables to facilitate inspection in case of trouble in tanks, purifiers,
valves or inaccessible appliances.
Where it was formerly necessary to work in the dark in case of gas
leakage in any department, it is now possible to turn on electric lights
from without, enter and make repairs by the aid of electric light, and
without danger from explosions.
As auxiliary electrical equipment may be mentioned a storage battery
of three cells of type D 7 Chloride Accumulators used in connection with
a spark coil for the gas engine igniter in starting up. This battery also
serves to operate an electric counter located in the coal gas generator
room. This counter is connected with the large main meter near the
offices and registers in view of the operators, the amount of gas passing
through the meter.


THE TECHNIC.
An electric telephone system with seven instruments, furnishes an
easy means for the superintendent to communicate with the various depart-
ments. Some difficulty was found at first, due to coke and coal dust,
which collected on top of the magneto boxes, and short circuited the
electrical contacts. Covers were afterwards provided for these contacts
thus effectually stopping the trouble.
A new and somewhat novel electrical device for indicating at the
works the exact gas pressure in the street mains, at the office building
over two miles away, has been in successful service for the past four
months. It was invented and designed for this special service, and a
patent has been applied for to cover its application to indicating or
recording at a distance any pressures, positions, volumes or changes of
pressure or position. The application may be made equally well to steam
or any vapor, gas or solid.
The indicating instrument consists of a voltmeter to measure the drop
of potential over a circuit of practically fixed resistance, over which a
current of constant value is passing. The current is provided by a storage
battery and is maintained constant by being continuously charged by
current from a dynamo. The current from the dynamo is regulated by
lamp or other resistance, so that the charging current is just enough in
excess of the battery current to provide for the loss in the battery accord-
ing to its efficiency. A sliding contact is attached to the bell of a
gasometer at the Gas Office. This sliding contact connects with the
various segments of a commutator connected at frequent points on the
resistance coil. These points are spaced uniformly with respect to the
drop in potential. As the contact point moves up or down, due to increase
or decrease of pressure in the gasometer, the drop in potential is greater
or less, and is so indicated on the voltmeter at the gas works. The volt-
meter is calibrated to read in terms of gas pressure as so many inches of
water head. The accompanying diagram illustrates the connections and
circuits as applied to both an indicating and a recording voltmeter.
In addition to these applications of electricity in a gas plant it is
now proposed to operate in the basement of the office building of the Gas
Company, another dynamo, directly connected to a small engine to be
likewise operated by natural gas. This is to be an exhibition plant to
illustrate the possibilities of using natural gas to advantage in driving
dynamos for light and power. Current will be supplied to several incan-
descent lamps to illuminate the exhibit, to arc lamps and to a motor
which will operate a pipe cutting machine, a drill press, an emery
wheel, a grindstone and an exhaust fan to ventilate the meter testing
and repair department. A dozen or more electric fans to ventilate ami
cool the offices will also be run by current from this same dynamo.
The possibilities of such plants on a good commercial basisare increas-
ing rapidly with the many improvements in the manufacture of close

THE TECHNIC.
regulating gas engines, and especially at the existing low rates for natural
gas. The cost of operation for such plants is so low that the Gas Company
claims that with water gas at more than double the present price of
natural gas, the cost of operation would still allow a good margin to com-
pete with steam plants using coal for fuel.
COAL MINING IN ALABAMA FROM AN ENGINEERING STANDPOINT.
HENRY GEISMER, '97.
The coal in the Birmingham district of Alabama is bituminous coal
and is comparatively easy to mine as it lies in nearly flat beds, the average
dip of the seam being about thirty minutes. Another feature that makes
the coal very easy to mine is the height of the coal seams above the water
courses of the district, as the coal outcrops in a large number of places.
It is at these outcrops that nearly all of the openings are made. In a few
cases, however, the outcrops are so situated that it would be impossible
to build railroads to them, in which case one must resort either to a slope
or shaft. Figure 1 is a cross section of a mountain showing the coal seam
and its outcrop.
Figure 1.
The first work required of an engineer in opening up one of these
mines is an outcrop survey. Running an outcrop line is similar to tracing
a single contour around a mountain. Find a place where the coal outcrops,
then either with an aneroid barometer or a level carry the elevation of
the outcrop around the mountain, allowance of course being made in the
levels for the dip of the seam. In some localities the coal bench is so
marked that after one finds the outcrop at any place on the side of the
mountain, the outcrop line can be followed by simply following the coal
bench.


37
Figure 2 is an outcrop map of a township. After the outcrop map is
made, the place for the main opening or openings is decided upon, and
then all of the entries are plotted on the outcrop map. The openings are
always made, if possible, at the lowest, place in the seam, and the work
is then carried to the raise. This is necessary on account of drainage; it

also gives the loaded cars the benefit of the down grade. The opening is
always made near a ravine in drift mines, as it is the ravine that the rail-
road engineer must look to for his roadbed from the mountain to the
valley below.
The method of working the coal is known as the pillar and room sys-
tem. A main or face entry is driven clear through the territory. Along


39
this main entry at distances of about three hundred feet cross or butt
entries are turned off which are driven through the territory but in a
direction almost at right angles to the main entry. It is from these butt
entries that the rooms are turned off. The block of coal between each set
of cross entries is split up by rooms some twenty-five feet wide, separated
from each other by pillars of coal some fifteen feet wide. The relative
width of the room and the pillar depends on the rock above the coal.
After all the rooms off from one entry are driven through to the next
entry, the miners start at the last pillar on that entry and mine out all of
the coal in it. As the coal in 'he pillar is pulled down wooden props are
put up to support the roof. It is necessary to leave the pillars standing
until the entry has been driven to its limit in order to prevent part of the
roof from falling and shutting off the entire entry. Figure 3 is a map of
the workings of a mine, and shows the method of ventilating the mine.
Coal has two vertical cleavage planes or cleats, as they are called, at
right angles to each other, or nearly so. One is called the face of the
coal and the other the butt. The working face of the coal must be
against the face as the coal is most easily broken in planes parallel
to the face; this makes it necessary that the working or secondary
entries be parallel to the face, or nearly so. The face thus limits the
direction of the entries.
After the directions of all of the entries are decided upon and located on
the map the engineer is depended upon to see that the work is driven
according to the original plans.
The men at work in the entries are kept in line by means of centers
or spads. Centers are points in the roof some three feet apart that admit
of strings or plum bobs being suspended from them. The best and most
common center is a horse shoe nail with a hole punched in its head,
driven into wooden plugs in the roof of the entry. A new set is needed
about every two hundred feet. To put up a new set the engineer sets up
under one of the spads of the last set, then puts his instrument in the line
of the entry by back sighting to one of the spads in the next to the last set.
A very good fore and back sight is an ordinary plumb bob with an extra
heavy cord. Suspend the plumb bob from the center and hold the flame
of a miner's lamp behind the cord in line with the line of the entry. The
flame that the instrument man sees has a black streak down the center
of it, and it is this streak that he is to bring to coincide with his vertical
cross-hair. After the center is driven into the roof the instrument man
measures the distance between it and the last set and then plots it on the
office map. This allows the company at any time to find out just how fast
the work is progressing.
Besides laying out the work the engineer is supposed to solve all
problems that come up in reference to drainage, haulage and ventilation.
The ventilation of the coal mine is a problem in itself that calls for a


THE TECHNIC.
great deal of engineering skill and judgment. Think of an underground
city several miles square, lilled with hard working men and you get some
idea of the difficulty and importance of ventilation. But in a paper of
this size one could not take up any of the real problems of the mine.
EXPLANATION OP TERMS USED.
Bench. The rock above and below the seam of coal is much harder
than the coal, and unlike the coal is hardly affected by exposure to the
air. As the coal disintegrates the rock above it breaks off while the rock
below remains firm ; this leaves a break in the side of the hill that is called
a bench.
Entry. A haulage way in the mine.
Outcrop. The part of the seam that is exposed.
Overcast. A large bridge or crossing built over an entry to permit the
air from an intersecting air course to pass over the entry.
REMINISCENCES.
FRANK P. DAVIS, '76.
Most engineers learn sooner or later that a thorough knowledge of the
everyday things of life, and plenty of common sense.contribute quite as
much to success as theoretical attainments. If an engineer is called upon
to do work on the frontier in uninhabited regions it is frequently as neces-
sary that he should be a cook, packer, boatman and doctor as that he be
a good engineer.
It is with these thoughts in mind that the writer ventures to present
for the perusal of the younger members of the profession some reminis-
cences culled from an experience of thirty years. In March, 1881, the
writer reported to the Chief Engineer of the Denver A Rio Grande Western
Ry., at Salina, Utah, to take charge of a party on location. The party
was made up in the east with the exception of chainmen, axmen, packers
and cooks. They were to be hired at Salina.
We were to cross the Wahsatch Mountains by way of Salina pass at
an elevation of seven thousand five hundred feet. In places the trail led
over gulches tilled with snow to a depth of from twenty to thirty feet. As
soon as the snow began to soften in the spring this part of the trail would
become impassable. It was therefore deemed important that we get away
as soon as possible. With this in view all the help and outfit to be pro-
vided there had been engaged before we arrived. We were told that our
cook ami packer were experienced men who understood their business.
The mules had never been packed, but it was thought that by having
them led for a day or two there would be no trouble.


r
It was my first experience in packing and I began to wonder how a
sheet-iron cook stove and a large drawing table were to be packed on a
mule's back, but wisely held my peace.
The morning of our departure found us up bright and early, with tents
down and bedding done up ready for packing. Immediately after break-
fast the mules were brought out and the pack saddles adjusted. Our
packer then proceeded to show his skill. The mule was held while he
piled on bundles until he thought the load was sufficient, when he lashed
them by passing a rope over the bundles and under the mule's belly until
one could hardly see either mule or bundles. I have since heard of and seen
squaw packing, but I am sure any squaw would drown herself if accused of
any such packing. The mule was turned loose and in about two minutes
trotted back to the corral without any pack. Night found us without a
mule packed. Our profficient packer was no good. That night an exper-
ienced packer came in and the next morning instructed us in the mystery of
the "decimal hitch," and showed us how to properly balance a pack so that
it would ride easily on the mule. The Chief Engineer concluded to give
us a four mule freight team, and keep part of the pack mules, so that by
eleven o'clock we were loaded and the train started, each mule being led
by a man. I was detained a couple of hours and followed on horseback.
Imagine my surprise and indignation on finding the outfit out about four
miles with mules unpacked, enjoying themselves over a feast of canned
fruit. It took some vigorous language to convince them that they would
find the value of all supplies thus broken into charged up against them
on the first pay-roll. There was no further trouble with that party on
account of provisions being molested.
Our cook proved to be but little better than our packer. The second
morning I got out early and found it had snowed about four inches during
the night. There was no fire, the dishes of the night before were where
we had eaten supper, unwashed, with knives, forks and spoons scattered
around on the ground under the snow. The cook was fast asleep. It only
took that cook about fifteen minutes to get up, dress, make up his pack
and get out of camp on the back track. The writer cooked breakfast.
That day I was fortunate in discovering that one of my men was an
excellent cook.
That morning the rodman got up with a severe case of mountain
fever. He was a very sick man but we could not delay, so I gave him my
saddle horse and he managed to pull through the day, taking large doses
of quinine to keep him up. The next day he had to take to the wagon
which nearly jolted the life out of him over the rough trail, but he was
too weak to sit on a horse. For three days he rode on the wagon until we
got over the summit where I was to halt and send back the team and
mule for more provisions. Our scanty medicine chest had nothing for
feversso we made a strong decoction of the sage brush of the desert and


THE TECHNIC.
gave it to him in large quantities, as hot as he could drink it. In this
way we kept him in a profuse perspiration untjl we broke the fever.
While at this camp the writer went out to hunt for deer, which were
plenty. A drove of six or eight was found huddled up behind a clump of
pinon pines. There was a fair shot at the head of one at a distance of
less than one hundred feet, but there were two standing so that their hind
quarters overlapped. Thinking to get two at one shot I drew on the two
and fired. Both went down but both jumped and went down the moun-
tain side on a run. I followed those deer all day and went to camp at
night without any game. Take a sure thing when you have it.
The next July and August we were hauling all our water from twenty
to forty miles, with the thermometer from 100° to 110°. At the same time
we were walking from three to six miles to and from our work over a very
rough mountain country, besides doing a full day's work in the field and
keeping up our map and profile at night. Frequently the cook would
hoist a lantern on the end of a wagon pole to guide us to camp. The
country was such that we could not get our wagons with water nearer.
Finally we adopted the plan of having the cook come out each afternoon
with provisions and water kegs packed on mules, and we would stop at
the end of the line for the night. In this way we did not go to camp for a
week.
While on this work the writer made an exploration through the lower
Price River Canon and a portion ol the Green River Canon. This was
probably the first time a white man went through the latter canon on
horseback. Major Powell had been through with boats. The trip was not as
difficult as was expected, and well repaid the hardship. For three days
we had a herd of deer of from twenty to thirty ahead of us, most of the
time within easy rifle range. There was not a spot where they could get
out of the canon. We only killed three, what we could use on the trip.
The next spring the writer accepted a position to take charge of a party
on location on the Mountain Division of the Canadian Pacific Railway.
A friend and I were to join a party from Winnipeg at Fargo, on the Northern
Pacific Railway. At this time the whole Red River country was under
water, and our train from Fargo west ran for miles over track which was
entirely submerged; as a consequence, instead of reaching Bismarck at
dark we were about ten hours behind time and rode all night. During
the night it became evident that two young men who occupied the seat
behind me were members of the party who had come from Winnipeg.
They were bewailing their hard fate at having to ride all night in an
ordinary coach. "Had they known they would have to endure such
hardship they would never have come."
About a month later when crossing an alkali flat on the trail north
from Fort Benton our mules were stampeded by a severe hail storm, and
with our wagons stuck in the mud we had to make camp for the night on


43
ground where there was water wherever one stepped. There was not a
bush or anything to be had to keep the blankets above the ground, and
those two young men would have considered a car a palace that night.
From Bismarck we took the first steamer up the river to Fort Benton.
The distance is about twelve hundred miles, and we made it in seventeen
days. Most of the time the weather was fine and in some parts the
scenery magnificent, so that we enjoyed it greatly.
The trip from Fort Benton to Fort Calgary, a distance of about 320
miles, as I remember it, was made with prairie schooners. Three wagons
were coupled together like cars and each train drawn by six teams of
mules. We averaged about twelve miles a day. The weather was fine,
and trout fishing in the small streams good. It was not at all uncommon
to see a man come into camp at night with a string of from ten to thirty
fine trout. Prairie dogs and rattlesnakes abounded along the trail. This
part of the journey was enjoyed by all. We had been told there would
be pack horses and packing outfit for us at the base of the mountains.
There were three parties of us and only horses and outfit enough for two,
so as the other parties were to go over the mountains to the west side
and my party to work on the east side, they were outfitted first, and I
had to rustle for horses and pack saddles. We brought unbroken horses
and had to turn to and make pack saddles. To do so we had to send
sixty miles to get screws and rings. This ride of one hundred and twenty
miles was made in two days, and every one who could use a knife or any
other tool was put to work on the saddles. Fortunately we had a packer
who had been in the business for years and was a first class man. As
soon as we had a few saddles we began to break in the horses. We found
one which objected, and after two days was still untamed. Our young
men thought it would be better to ride him first. One after another they
tried, but he was unridden. We finally filled sacks with wet sand and
put a load of about four hundred pounds on him and conquered, but for a
week he had to be blindfolded and led on the trail.
Our route led up the magnificent valley of the Bow River, following
an Indian trail which wound around and over fallen timber, and was
hardly passable for heavily laden animals.
Our transportation was so limited that the men were only allowed to
take their bedding and an extra pair of socks on the first trip. This had
to last for two weeks.
The morning of the third day out we came to Swift Current Creek, a
stream about two hundred feet wide and from two to three feet deep.
The current was so swift it would sweep a man off his feet, and the water
icy cold. The only way to ford it was for each man to twist his hand
into the tail of one of the pack horses and take the halter of the following
horse in the other hand, and then be towed over. All got safely over but
were chilled to the marrow. About two hours later Bow River had to be

forded. We then went into camp and built huge fires, and everybody
hung themselves up to dry.
The night of June 15th found us camped on the summit of the moun-
tains at an elevation of five thousand three hundred feet. It was exactly
three months from the date I left Salt Lake City to start on the journey.
That night there was a snowfall of six inches.
Black bear were very numerous, several having been seen while on
the trail and at wash, so we concluded on Fourth of July to invite two
parties and have a grand bear hunt, to be followed by a dinner at my
camp.
Huson's party all joined us except one who was coming to the dinner
later. We formed a large circle beating the bush, and gradually drawing
in toward the center expecting to have one or more bears, but we found
none. In the meantime a bear walked into Huson's camp, helped him-
self to a basin of molasses, growled at the single unarmed occupant and
departed.
At this time we were three hundred miles from the nearest postofHce,
and had to send and receive all of our mail via Fort Benton, Montana.
We had to maintain our own mail route for about two hundred miles.
The next winter the writer and four others made a trip from Fort
Calgary to Moose Jaw, a distance of four hundred and fifty miles, without
putting up a tent. In one pla.ce we had to carry our wood for six days.
At the end of the sixth day we had only wood for one more fire and were
twenty-live miles from the nearest timber. We went to bed supperless
that night and saved our wood for breakfast. The next morning the
thermometer was fifty-two degrees below zero. Fancy frying bacon and
cooking slapjacks on the open prairie at that temperature.
We started on foot to make the twenty-five miles, telling the teamster
to come as far as he could then unhook his horses and come on with them.
About 4 p. m. those on foot reached the company's storehouse at Med-
icine Hat, and about six the teamster came in with three horses, one having
given out. When we sent back for the wagon only his bones were found.
The wolves had picked them clean. We were just a month making the
trip from Fort Calgary to Winnipeg.
The next spring we crossed the summit going to the west side on the
eleventh of May and had to shovel a path for our pack train through from
two to four feet of snow for about two miles.
That season's work was very trying. For a long time we were work-
ing on the face of nearly perpendicular cliffs, at an elevation of from one
hundred feet to three hundred feet above the river. The rock was a soft
shale, and in places we could pick footholds so as to crawl around, in
other places men were lowered over the face of the cliffs with ropes. For
weeks we vvere working where a misstep would mean certain destruction,
but we never had a man injured. Our pack trail, over which all of our


4 5
supplies had to come was picked into the face of the mountains at an
elevation of five hundred to six hundred feet above the river and was not
over a foot and a half wide. Our pack horses had been gradually accus-
tomed to the work so that they passed over it in perfect safety, but that
fall a train which had always worked on level ground in the valley of the
Columbia River, attempted to pass over it and became dizzy so they had
to be blindfolded and led. Oue horse went over the cliffs to the river
below.
The country was so very rough that in one part for a distance of three
miles we could not find a place where we could set up our tents.
Our route from the summit to the Columbia River followed the Kick-
ing Horse River, which for most of the distance is very narrow, the
mountains rising right from the water to a height of from three thousand
to six thousand feet above the river. The slopes are covered with a dense
growth of small pines and fir trees, while the surface is covered to a
height of several feet with a net work of the dried trunks of trees which
have been killed by forest fires.
In August we noticed fire on the mountains several miles below us,
but for several days it did not appear to make much headway. Finally
the wind changed and it began to come rapidly up the valley. At night
it had reached a small creek which emptied into the river about
two hundred yards below our camp. At night the wind changed
and blew down the canons, so that with the heavy dew we knew
we were safe until morning. The next morning we were up by light
preparing for the fire. We piled all our stores, bedding, etc., in the
middle of our camp ground and covered them with the tents which we
thoroughly soaked with water. We cleaned a space about fifteen feet
wide on all sides and wet the ground. Then we set fire on all sides and
began to burn the brush slowly outward from our clearing, but it soon got
beyond our control, for within a few feet back of our camp the mountain
rose and was covered with timber as dry as tinder. When our fire
reached this it went up the slope as though it had been soaked with oil.
About this time the fire crossed the creek below us and came up the
valley. We had to go over the bank into the river for protection. In less
than five minutes there was a mass of fire covering the mountains on both
sides of the river clear to their summits and extending up the valley of
the river five or six miles. The roar could have been heard for miles and
the heat was intense. For hours we had to sit close under the bank of
the river in the shallow water. It was not until nearly four o'clock in the
afternoon that the heat and smoke had abated enough so we could come
out and put up our tents for the night. All night long we could see the
flames and hear their roar and the crashing of falling timber further up
the valley where the fire was still raging. It was one of the grandest
spectacles a man ever beheld and one never to be forgotten, but one

through which none of us would care to go again. Previous to this moun-
tain goats and black bear had been very plentiful, but we did not see a
trace of either again that fall.
On this work there was no doctor sent out and any cases of sickness
or accident had to be attended to by the chief of the party who was
expected to have flesh needles, silk and adhesive plaster for wounds and
common remedies for sickness. Fortunately there was only one severe
surgical case, though a number of minor cuts had to be sewed up There
were no severe cases of sickness. The weather usually was good, the
work interesting, though arduous, and all enjoyed it. We had some of
the finest trout fishing in the world.
We will now shift the scene to a sub-tropical country.
In early December, 1887, the writer landed in Nicaraugua to take
charge of a party on the surveys for a ship canal. The climate, method
of living, means of transportation, and everything was new. The country
where we were to work was an uninhabited wilderness, and the rain was
falling in torrents. The work which I was to undertake was situated
about twenty miles directly back from Greytown, but on the other side of
a high range of hills. We spent two days in preparation and then took
steamer up San Juan River forty miles to San Francisco Island where we
were to have our base of supplies. We left Greytown at daylight with a
heavy fog and mist, but the sun soon came out and we had a perfect day.
Nothing could be more beautiful than the scenery along the river.
Everything was new and interesting, the tropical vegetation, the alligators
sunning themselves on the banks, the many colored parrots and macaws,
the great iguanas (lizards five or six feet long), and monkeys jumping
from limb to limb in the trees kept our attention fully occupied, and
night came all too soon. We did not reach San Francisco Island until
the next morning at daylight. From here our transportation was by
means of steel canoes propelled by five or six men paddling. Each party
had three canoes.
My route followed up a narrow tortuous stream with a strong current
and filled with fallen timber. We had hardly entered the mouth ere the
rain came and hardly let up for an hour for a whole month. At night we
had to clear a small place and set up our tents to sleep in, while the cook
was starting a fire with wet wood and cooking supper in a pouring rain.
By the time a tent was up the soft wet ground would be a semi-liquid
mud from six to ten inches deep. Our folding cots would barely reach
above the mud and one had to stand on a box to dress and undress.
During the day everyone was in the water cutting logs out in places,
in others hauling the boats over, and all the time the rain falling in tor-
rents. When I say torrents I speak advisedly, for we recorded rainfalls of
ten inches in twenty-fourhours, thirty inches in six days, sixty-four inches
in a month and three hundred inches in a year. Thus we toiled along for


47
a long weary week ere we reached a point where we could go no further
with our boats. We made a temporary camp and at once began prepara-
tions for a permanent camp about half a mile ahead'beside a beautiful
waterfall almost twenty feet in height. Here we had a natural bath tub
carved out of solid rock about sixty feet long by ten feet in width with
about eight feet of water.
It took another week to clear off the camp site move our things and
get camp up. We flattered ourselves that we could at last take comfort.
That night we had a rainfall of nine inches between dark and daylight.
Our tent had mildewed and although we had a fly the water came through
everywhere. We stretched rubber blankets over our beds and went to
sleep. In the morning we found a sheet of water three inches deep all
over the bottom of the tent. That day we split logs and put in a floor.
We soon learned to discard tents entirely and live in shacks thatched
overhead with palm leaves, with the sides entirely open. We usually
put in a floor about a foot above the ground to allow air to circu-
late. These were much dryer and every way more comfortable than
tents.
On Christmas day while in our temporary camp we ate dinner along-
side of a large log, holding an umbrella in one hand and carving with the
other. It was here one of our young men who was having his first
experience gave utterance to his feelings as follows: "I would start for
home tomorrow if the old man had not said if I came home he would take
me across his knee and paddle me." He was not the only one who felt
that way.
In spite of the rain surveys had to be made. At first we tried to pro-
tect ourselves by wearing ponchos, but in that warm climate they were
unbearable and soon discarded. When we came in at night we would
hang our wet clothes out in the rain, take a bath and put on dry ones for
the night. In the morning after breakfast we would wring the water out
of the wet ones, pull them on and go to work.
When working on the low grounds in the swamps the men would be
in water all day long, the axinen and chainmen frequently having to
swim, but in spite of all this all were healthy and usually kept in good
spirits.
The underbrush in the woods is so exceedingly dense that one man might
pass within ten feet of another and never see him. It was absolutely
impossible to sketch topographically at all, everything had to be done by
instruments. The work was necessarily slow and expensive.
Much more might be said about this class of work but this paper is
already over long. If these reminiscences have brought home to the mind
of the young engineer the necessity of a thorough knowledge of things
other than technical and impressed the fact that an engineer's road to
success is frequently not a path of roses, the writer's end is accomplished.


THE TECHNIC.
THE FOUNDATION OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF HYDRAULIC CURVE
RESISTANCE.
GAKDNElt S. WILLIAMS, '89.
It is well that we understand the basis upon which the everyday
formula; of science are established in any case, and it is particularly so
where the formula1 are of the empiric class, for as is being more gener-
ally recognized now than formerly, it is a questionable proceeding to
apply an empiric formula, to cases much beyond the limits of the experi-
ments upon which it is founded. The science of hydraulics, as we know
it, is a little more than a century old, but its working formula.' are almost
entirely empiric and many of them have been but slightly improved since
they were first proposed.
The subject of the resistance to the flow of water in pipes due to
curvature had received nearly all of its experimentation and study
previous to 1855 and since that time, if we except a brief series of experi-
ments made in connection with another investigation in 1888, there has
been no addition to our knowledge of it.
The recorded experiments upon curvature in pipes may be divided into
two classes: Those on sinuous pipes and those on pipes with single
bends. The earlier experiments, perhaps, for want of sufficiently delicate
means of measuring losses of head, experimented mainly upon the
former ami for want of a proper understanding of the effect of the single
curve in connection with subsequent ones their deductions have been
sometimes erroneous and usually of little practical significance to the
ordinary enquirer who lays his pipe as straight as possible and seldom
introduces more than a single right angle at a time.
The first experimenter to investigate curves appears to have been
Bossut whose first work "Nouvelles Experiences sur la resistance des
fluides," was published in 1777, and his "Traite theoretique et experi-
mental d'Hydrodynamique" in 1786. According to D'Aubuisson who has
abstracted Bossut's experiments, he used a pipe 0.088587 feet in diameter
and 53.2834 feet long, and when extended horizontally in a straight line
found it to deliver 0.730 cubic feet per minute under a head of 1.0662 feet;
then bending it into a serpentine form of six well rounded curves, the
delivery was, all else being as before, 0.720 cubic feet per minute.
(D'Aubuisson, Bennett's Translation, page 213).
The next experimenter to deal with curvature was Dubuat, who pub-
lished his " Principes Hydraulique" in 1786, a second edition appearing
in 1810. Dubuat records a description of twenty-five experiments upon
curved pipes of which twenty-two were upon pipe 0.0888 feet in diameter
and the other three upon one 0.1770 feet in diameter. Eleven of these


49
experiments are quoted by D'Aubuisson (Bennett's Translation, page
214) and the whole series is tabulated by Dr. Thomas Young (" Philo-
sophical Transactions Eoyal Society 1808," page 174) who there deduces
from them two formulae. These experiments as published by Dr. Young,
when reduced to English measures are as follows:

Not having access to Dubuat's own account of his work the writer
can only add to the information in this table the statement of D'Aubuis-
son that Dubuat first took the straight pipes and ascertained the discharge
for a given time under a certain head, and then, having bent them,
observed the head required to discharge through them the same quantity
of water in the same time, the difference of the two heads giving him the
resistance due to the curves. From these experiments Dubuat deduced a
formula for curve resistance, which is based upon the assumption that
the central filament of the water apprdaching a curve continues in a
straight line in the prolongation of the axis of the straight pipe until it is

deflected by contact with the outer wall of the curve, when it is assumed
to make au angle * of reflection with the tangent to the curve at that
point and continue in this new direction until again similarly deflected.
This formula for English measures is h = .00375V'Ssin2*. . It was applied
to but fifteen of the foregoing experiments by its author who rejected the
remaining ten as irregular because, according to Dr. Young, they did not
agree with his equation. From these experiments Dr. Young deduced

his equation, h= , K being the radius of curvature and V the
velocity, which fits all four of the experiments very well; and Xavier

deduced also from them h = (.0l279551+1.0186R) -jJTV-,where 1' is the

length of the curve measured along the convex side of the stream.
The next experiments upon curves appear to have been made by
Venturi, and published in 1797. He made three pipes, according to
D'Aubuisson, 15 inches long and 1.3 inches in diameter. One was straight,
the second had a curve of 90° gently rounded and the third had an
abrupt angle of 90°. Under a head of 2.887 feet they filled a vessel con-
taining 4 838 cubic feet in 45, 50 and 70 seconds respectively.
In 1831 George Rennie published in the Philosophical Transactions
the results of a series of experiments upon a lead pipe % &gt;ncn m diameter
and fifteen feet long, which was very carefully drawn over a mandril.
The curves used were of 3^ and 1% inches radius, and his first experi-
ment embraced one 3J^-inch curve of 90° to the right, joining one 7&gt;£-inch
of 180° to the left, which latter joined one 3X-inch of 90° to the right,
and this appears to have been followed by a short tangent. The pipe was
first experimented upon while straight, the end being fixed in a wooden
plug which fitted an orifice in the side of the reservoir. Rennie records
his experiments as follows:

Rennie then calls attention to the incorrectness of both Dubuat's and
Young's fortnulse but wisely refrains from deducing one of his own.
We now come to the investigations of Dr. Julius Weisbach which were
published from 1845 to 1863, and from which, with some of Dubuat's, that
authority deduced his well known and generally accepted formula for
curve resistance: h= "(0. 131+1.847^-j^ * j- jjg'JgfF t,1»18 ^ormu1a *8
the one quoted by the principal authorities of England, Germany, Italy
and America—though the French patriotically refuse to recognize it—the
experiments upon which it is based should be especially interesting. Its
author after entering upon a theoretical discussion of the laws of curve
resistance, suddenly drops the subject and introduces this formula which
he states is purely empirical.
Before taking up his experiments upon curves Weisbach experimented
with a series of mouthpieces and pipe connected in sections to his res-

ervoir and determined the discharge for a given time. The head was
measured by hook and point gauges and the quantity discharged was
determined by measurement in a small tank whose dimensions were very
carefully determined. "It does not appear that he used weights to deter-
mine the quantity of water discharged. The rise of water in the measur-
ing tank was read by a combination of a hook and point gauge, the former
being set at the level of the water surface at the beginning of the experi-
ment and the surface at the close being located by the latter. They were
carried on a single spindle, the zero of the scale being at the point of the
hook gauge. From these experiments he established the coefficients of

For Weisbach's theoretical discussion of curve and bend resistance
the reader is referred to Coxe's Translation of Volume I of the "Mechanic*
of Engineering," and though it is also given in "Die Experimental
Hydraulik" we pass on to a consideration of his published experiments.
The mouth piece A used in the following experiments was of brass
1 cin. in internal diameter and 3 cm. long, and was rounded at the entry
end and attached to a plate that was screwed into the side of the reservoir
from which the water was obtained. The piece B was of the same
diameter and material but its length is not given. From the plates it
appears to have been about 5.5 diameters in length. The coefficients &lt;«!'
efflux and resistance for these two pieces were previously determined and
are then subtracted from those for the whole appartus to get those for thr
elbows and curves.
The method of experimentation was to observe the time required to
deliver a certain quantity of water through the apparatus being examined,
starting with the water at a given height. By this means the only
observed quantity difficult to determine was the time and any apparent
errors are probably to be found in it.

THE TECHNIC.
NOTES OS ABOVK EXPERIMENTS. TABLE III.
Experiment No. i.—Weisbach explains the high value of f by the fact
that the stream having been contracted in passing around the elbow
escapes into the air before the head used in this contraction is regained.
Experiment No. 2.—Weisbach here states that as the coefficient J is
greater than that obtained from the Table in "Mechanics'" which was
deduced from a number of elbows of larger diameter, he concludes the
resistance due to elbows in a small pipe will be greater than that in a
larger one for the same angular deflection. Though it is possible that this
view may be the correct one it is interesting to enquire what might have
been the effect if the pipe B had been longer, for if adding 5)e diameters
to the length of a leg already two diameters long has the effect of reduc-
ing f from 1.902 to 1.030 it seems a bold assumption that no further
reduction would occur.
Experiment No. 3.—From this the value of i for two elbows is 3.302
and by No. 2 it was found for one elbow to be 1.630. If, however, we take
the value from No. 2 for the same heads as in No. 3 we get 1.990 — .290 =
1.706. It appears, therefore, that the resistance due to the second curve
is less than that due to the first. This conclusion, although frequently
drawn from these experiments may be somewhat misleading. Weisbach
divides the coefficient 3.302 by two getting 16.51 for the resistance of each
bend which he considers in good accord with No. 2. The high value of i
for No. 3 is explained as in No. 1.
Experiments Nos. 4 and 5.—The value of sc is higher than that given by
the tables referred to under No. 2.
Experiment No. 6.—The outflowing stream diverged like a cone. Weis-
bach says: "Since the coefficient of friction may be taken as .075 there
remains only f = 0.400 — .075 = 0.385, whence it appears that the resist-
ance of the semicircle is but little greater than tha of the quadrant."
Experiment No. 7.—The coefficient for the two curves being 0.SO8, if
that of each were the same I hey would be 0.404 but from No. 6 so = 0.460
+ 0.324 = 0.784 and f for one curve = 1.138 — 0.784 = 0.354. (Wiesbach
gives 1.138 — 0.704 = 0.35.'! which is apparently an error as these values
do not agree with No. 6).
Experiment No. 8.—Subtracting f, = 1.138 for No. 7 we have for the
90° curve alone f = 1.719 — 1.138 = 0.581, this high vidue being due to the
reversal of the stream by this curve.
Experiment No. 9.—Subtracting from fi the value of '1 in No. 5 we
have £ for the semicircle = 1.185 — 0 026 = 0.559 which Weisbach con-
siders in good accord with with the value 0.400 in No. 0.
Experiment No. 10.—Subtracting from fi the value of fi in No. 4 we
have f for the semicircle = 1.105 — 0.502 = 0.603.
Experiment No. 11.—Subtracting the coefficient for the combination in
No. 10 there remains for the last curve of 90° f = 1.593 — 1.105 = 0.4SS.


SS
Using a single 90° elbow, a single 90° curve and a single 180° curve of
the above list, successively in combination with a long pipe, each curve
being terminated by the pipe B the axes being in each case horizontal
YVeisbach obtained the following values of the cofficient f: For the elbow,
1.657 and 1.661; for the 90° curve, 0.517 and for the 180° curve practically
the Rame value as for the 90° curve.
From all of the foregoing it. must be apparent that the position of the
curve ii&gt; the system, whether in straight pipe'or in combination with
other curves, luis a considerable bearing upon the coefficient of resistance.
In the foregoing experiments which were made in the laboratory, oh
account of the small capacity of the reservoir the head continually varied,
and over a considerable ranye in each experiment. In the summer of
1856 Weisbach in ide further experiments out of doors under high heads
where the supply of water was taken from a large pipe 18^ inches
(Saxony) diameter. This insured a fairly constant head. The experi-
ments are recorded in " Der Civil Ingenieur," 1863. The pipe approach-
ing the orifice to which the apparatus experimented upon was attached,
was increased in diameter to reduce the velocity of approach so that the
velocity of a 1 cm. diameter would be 441 times that of approach. The
head was measured by a mercury column, corrections being made for
capillarity and temperature. The water was measured in a tank as before
and the time of discharging a given quantity under a given head was
observed.
Concluding, Weisbach says: "From this investigation we find that
the resistance of water flowing through elbows is much greater than
through curves, though the conformity of results with one another and
with those of another investigation (Experimental Hydraulik) leaves
much to be desired. It is also apparent that (he resistance in elbows for
the same velocity is greater for small than for large pipe."—See Table IV.
In " Der Civil Ingenieur," Vol. X., Weisbach publishes another
series of experiments upon curves and elbows, this one being with low
heads.—See Table V.

Commenting upon these experiments, Weisbach says: "We see
from the above experiments that the coefficient of resistance for an elbow,
even at low velocities, is much greater than that of a curve, when the
stream is in both cases turned ninety degrees. It also appears from thi.s
investigation that the resistance due to change of direction decreases as
the diameter of the pipe increases. The mean results for a right angle
elbow are:
Exp. No. 18, d = 1.0 cm. f = 2.57 h:
"21, d = 1.4 "f = 2.28 h:
"25, d = 2.45 " f = 1.46 h:

for curves of greater diameter is f = 0.294.
The experiments upon elbows and curves of larger diameter to which
Weisbach refers and from which he deduced his formula and tables as
published in his "Mechanics of Engineering," have apparently never
been printed, and so far as the writer has been able to learn there is no
data concerning them available. From the fact that in none of his later
series of experiments did he use anything of a diameter greater than 2.5
centimeters, about one inch, and that he also used in the production of
his formula some of Dubuat's results, none of which were upon pipe more
than 2.2 inches in diameter, it is safe to say that the formula which the
writers of text-books would have us apply to pipes from six inches to six
feet in diameter has been derived from experiments upon tubes whose
average diameters have not been above one inch.
Even for the diameters which these experiments cover, and granting
to them a very high degree of accuracy, which they undoubtedly deserve,
they seem hardly comprehensive enough to base a formula upon, and
there is little reason to think that the unpublished series of investigations
were conducted in a very different manner or afforded very different
results from those presented above. In all of these the method of deter-
mining the coefficient for the curves seems open to question, and the lack
of sufficient length in the discharge pipe, and in many cases, its entire
absence, introduce conditions not likely to be found in practice.
In addition to the foregoing experiments Dupuit "Conduite et Distri-
bution des Eaux," states that in pipe up to 8 cm. diameter he has never
found a 90° curve to show a resistance greater than that due to two meters


59
of pipe; and Hagen "Wasserbau" says that a pipe 0.364 inches in
diameter and 8 feet long delivered the same quantity of water under the
same conditions of time and head when bent into a circle as when
straight, and while giving a reduced discharge when bent more sharply,
had in the latter case its cross sectiom reduced by a change from the
circular to the eliptical form due to bending.
In the minutes of Proceedings of the Institute of Civil Engineers,
Vol. XII, there is an account of a series of experiments upon curves in
lead pipe of %, and 1 inch diameter, made in Liverpool. The
radius of curvature of the bends is not given and the only interesting
thing about the series is the contradiction of Rennie's statement that the
discharge is the same whether the bend is near the inlet or near the
effluent end, these experiments showing the discharge to be greater when
the curves are near the inlet end.
The next, and to date, so far as the writer is aware*, the last published
experiments upon curves were those of Mr. John R. Freeman, made at
Lowell in 1888 and published in his classic memoir on "The Hydraulics
of Fire Streams," in the Transactions of American Society of Civil
Engineers, Vol. XXI.
The results of this last investigation are, in the light of what has gone
before, or at least in that of the commonly accepted theories, somewhat
startling. In brief they are as follows:
Hose straight at beginning of experiment, 2\i inches in diameter, length
51.8 feet, 17.0 feet per second velocity, loss of head 8.55 lbs.
Hose straight at end of experiment, 2% inches in diameter, length 51.8 feet,
17.0 feet per second velocity, loss of head 8.55 lbs.
Hose bent around 4 curves of 90°, with 2 feet radius, length 51.8 feet, 17.0 feet
per second velocity, loss of head 9.04 lbs.
Hose bent around 4 curves of 90°, with 3 feet radius, length 51.8 feet, 17.0 feet
per second velocity, loss of head 9.28 lbs.
Hose bent around 4 curves of 90°, with 4 feet radius, length 51.8 feet, 17.0 feet
per second velocity, loss of head 9.32 lbs.
From this it is seen that the sharper the curves, the less the resist-
ance, while the ordinary theory, and common judgment would indicate
the reverse, but from the foregoing experiments of the older experimenters
it is at once seen that none of them approached the conditions of Mr.
Freeman's investigation and however much we might be inclined to doubt
his results we must bear in mind that there is nothing in the work of his
predecessors which can be made tocontradict them. Although Mr. Free-
man's experiments have now been in print nearly ten years, the latest of
our hydraulic text-books are still blindly quoting Weisbach, or else main-
taining that curve resistance is insignificant, and can be almost wholly
eliminated by increasing the radius of the curves.
The beginning of an investigation of curvature in small pipe is given by H. P.
Bovey and f. P Strickland in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada for
1898-9, but the results so far are not of sufficient value to bo included here, although
they give promise of much in the future.—CJ. S. W.


THE TECHNIC.
WHAT IS THE TEMPERATURE OF MAXIMUM DRAUGHT IN A
CHIMNEY?
ROBERT C. STEVENS, '95.
It is interesting to note how the statement of an apparent fact, once
asserted by an authority, and oft-quoted and relied upon by succeeding
writers, may be accepted and reiterated long after its falsity has been
repeatedly demonstrated.
The theory that a maximum draught, or the delivery of a maximum
weight of gases, occurs in a chimney at a temperature of about 000J
Fahrenheit, has been advanced and debated for many years and very gen-
erally accepted. It was first proposed by Peclet in his earlier works and
was adopted by as eminent an authority as Professor Rankine; but it is
a significant fact that Peclet, in the later editions of his works, abandoned
this theory for a new one that does not give a maximum. Howevw,
although the author of the theory admitted its error and recent experi-
ment and observation disproves it, the statement of a maximum draught
at 000" Fahrenheit still appears in many a text-book accompanied by its
mathematical demonstration. Such being the case, there is sufficient
reason for calling attention to the subject at this time.
As a mathematical discussion the demonstration is simple and inter-
esting. That its conclusion is in error, due to a false assumption, may be
more clearly understood after a review of the problem. The following is
in brief the usual form of its statement:
"According to Peclet," (He is always quoted, though the change of
opinion that he experienced in later years is rarely mentioned.) the
height of head necessary to produce a given velocity in a chimney, is—
Where
h = head necessary to produce velocity (u) expressed in feet of column
of hot gases.
u = issuing velocity of hot gases, in feet per second,
g = acceleration due to gravity = 32.2.
G = co-eflicient of resistance of grate and fuel bed to the entrance of air.
f =: co-efficient of friction of sides of flue and chimney, which depends for
its value upon the condition of the surfaces.
1 = total distance, in feet, traversed by gases to top of chimney,
m = area of section of chimney divided by its circumference.
Then in the above equation, the first term is the resistance due to
acceleration and the second and third the frictional resistances in furnace
and flue respectively. Peclet "estimated" f = 0.012, though experiment


61
would indicate that value to be somewhat too low. He also "asserted"
that, with ordinary grates burning from 20 to 24 pounds of coal per square
foot per hour, G = 12. If these substitutions are made and the above
formula solved for u, we have:
4
2 gh
0.012 1
13+ ——
Now h may be expressed in terms of the height of the chimney:
h = H 10.98 ^ — 1 J
Where
H = height, in feet, of chimney above grates.
ti = mean absolute temperature of gases in chimney.
t-2 = absolute temperature of external air.
Substituting, the second equation becomes:
2g H I t,
u = -nn... , 0.96T
1 in
Then the weight of hot gases discharged per second is:
w, A u = 1; ( 0.0807 + fj A Jis^0^ial Jo.86-£-
(constant)
ti
Where
Wi = weight of a cubic foot of gases at temperature ti.
t&lt;i = absolute temperature at 32° Fahrenheit.
V0 = volume, in cubic feet, of air at 32° Fahrenheit, supplied per pound of
fuel burned.
A = area of cross-section of chimney flue in square feet.
The above will be a maximum for tj = 2,i2-12, or the best chimney
draught takes place when the absolute temperature of the gases in the
chimney is to that of the external air as 25 to 12, or when the temperature
of the flue gases is in the neighborhood of 600° Fahrenheit. For example:
when the external air is at 50° Fahrenheit the temperature of maximum
draught is 604° Fahrenheit. When this condition is fulfilled, the preceding
equation gives h = H and the density of the hot gases is one-half that of
the external air.
Now it appears reasonable that in a chimney of given dimensions, the
head and the velocity and consequently the quantity of gases discharged,
or the "flow of weight," increases with the internal temperature. But it


THE TECHNIC.
does not do so to an unlimited extent; for, while the draught power is
increasing as the result of higher temperature, the air in the chimney is
expanding and there comes a point where the decrease in density due to
this increase in volume counterbalances the increase in velocity. Beyond
this point there is a diminution in the weight of the discharge. This
limit of gas delivery also determines the amount of fuel that can be burned
on the grate. Now, if 600° is the point of nlaximum draught and is even
slightly exceeded in practice, the delivery of hot gases and the corres-
ponding supply of air to the fuel would decrease, with a resultant diminu-
tion in fuel consumption, followed by a consequent reduction of stack
temperature. Not only then is 000° the temperature of maximum draught,
but the maximum temperature attainable with natural draught; a con-
clusion which is manifestly absurd and that will be contradicted by
anyone who has observed the operation of steam boilers. This tempera-
ture is often exceeded, 650°, 700°, even 850° being not uncommon; though
no one would defend such cases as representative of good practice.
Where then is the mathematical discussion incorrect? Merely in its
assumption that the value of G, or coefficient of resistance of grate and
fuel bed, is a constant. Experiment has shown and on deliberation reason
will support the conclusion that it is a variable of a wide range of value,
changing continually with a slight variation in the condition of the fire.
The quality of the coal, whether coarse or fine, coking or non-coking,
would also modify it. It is interesting to note that Professors Gale ami
Thurston arrived independently at the conclusion that the value of G is
variable, and is approximately in inverse proportion to the square of the
absolute temperature of the chimney (tj8). Professor Thurston places
G= ~j~T, 1n which a is a constant, usually not far from 2 and t3 is the
absolute temperature representing the mean within the fire. He con-
cludes that the temperature of maximum delivery is a variable quantity
"far above that ordinarily taken as that of good practice in the opera-
tion of the steam boiler."
Mr. Thomas Box says that " the maximum effect is attained when
the volume of the internal air is between three and four times that of the
external air * * *. If we admit 3}$ as the relative volume, the tem-
perature would be about 1300 degrees." In 1889, Professor H. B. Gale
concluded after many experiments that "The ordinary values of the
temperature of maximum draught would range from one thousand to two
thousand degrees on the common Fahrenheit scale." In 1890, Professor
R. II. Thurston arrived at the conclusion that "hoth the facts of experi-
ment and the deduction of our theory confirm the proposition that the
maximum draught in the sense in which the term is here used (that of
maximum delivery, not of maximum intensity) ordinarily, if not invaria-
bly, occurs at a temperature far above that previously supposed; that


63
maximum rising as the resistance at the grate increases and as the
resistance in the stack decreases. It is probably rarely found at temper-
, atures less than 700° or 800°, or very probably 1,000° Fahrenheit." And
again: "No maximum draught is likely to be approached at any temper-
ature occurring in the chimney, the actual maxima falling more commonly
at points on the scale between 800° and 2,000° Fahrenheit."
It therefore seems quite well established that the maximum draught
is not reached at a temperature of 600° Fahrenheit, although it is none the
less true that the temperature of the stack in practice should rarely, if
ever, be allowed to exceed that figure. If greater draught is needed to
burn the required amount of fuel there will be some gain in raising the
temperature within the stack even above 600°. Such proceedure, how-
ever, is very uneconomical and is to be avoided, especially in view of the
fact that the draught power approaches the maximum slowly, considera-
ble increase in temperature being followed by only a small gain in power.
With a heating surface properly distributed and in correct proportion
to the grate surface, the temperature of the gases may be made to
approach closely to that of the water in the boiler, the height of chimney
giving a head sufficient for draught instead of a high and wasteful internal
temperature.
MICHIGAN ENGINEERS IN THE WAR.
In connection with the register of alumni of the Engineering Depart-
ment, it is thought fitting to make special mention of both the gradu-
ates and undergraduates of this department, who were connected in
various ways with the Spanish war last year. The place, the duty, and
the services performed by those who were engineers were in many cases
little thought of and never mentioned in the newspapers and magazines,
but the engineer's work was of none the less importance because of this
lack of publicity.
The work done by the crew and naval reserves, many of whom were
from the Engineering Department, and of no experience at sea whatever,
on the Yosemite, where there was an immense amount of work to be
done to get the ship in readiness; the intelligence and efficiency with
which that work was done; and the remarkably short time in which they
trained down to good fighting men, has been the subject of considerable
mention by officers in charge.
Those whose duties were of great importance and no glory are to be
remembered as well as those who saw active service. Nor must be for-
gotton those who have enlisted and whose companies were not called
out. The spirit of self-sacrifice and duty to our country was alike in all.
The following is a list of the men with the positions they held:


THE TECHNIC.
First is Mortimer E. Cooley, Professor of Mechanical Engineering,
who was assigned as chief engineer to the U. S. S. Yosemite. He was
in charge of transforming the vessel to a cruiser and fitting her for active
service. He held the position of Chief Engineer through the war and
until February of the present year. It was a fitting tribute to Professor
Cooley's work and a recognition of his ability when the Yosemite was
selected by the government as the most efficient and best conditioned of
any of the auxiliary cruisers for foreigQ service, to go to Guam island, in
the Ladrones.
Baker, Wm. P., '99. Woodville, 0.—Private Co. A., 31st Mich. Vol. Inf.

S. Navy; executive officer U. S. S. Apache.
Bush, Platt R., '95, Saginaw, Mich.—Civil engineer, at work on Fort
Jackson, La. Died at Harper Hospital, Detroit, October 4, 1898.
The work on the defenses at Forts Jackson and St. Phillip was being
rushed night and day. Mr. Bush was on night duty, and the hard
work and exposure undoubtedly had something to do with making
him less able to resist disease. The immediate cause of death was
a malignant tumor, affecting the brain.

MEMORANDUM REGARDING THE COLORING OF PIPING IN THE
UNITED STATES NAVY.
The contents of the pipe, whether steam, fresh water, salt water, etc.,
will be indicated by a colored band, about eight inches long on each side
of flanges and couplings, being painted red or black, in accordance with
the following instructions:


The color of the bands will be:
Steam piping White.
Salt water (steam pump) Green.
Salt water (hand pump) Grey.
Freshwater (steam pump) Blue.
Fresh water (hand pump) Blue.
Ventilation duets Yellow.
Firemain Red.
Drainage system Pink.
Flooding system Pink.
The coloring of the faces of the flanges and couplings is determined
follows:
A steam pump, a hand pump, a steam engine,
a ventilating blower, a distiller, a hydrant on shore,
or a fresh water distributing tank being considered
a machine .
The supply or suction to such machine will be
marked bt-ack, and the exhaust, discharge or
delivery from such machine will be marked red.
On drainage and flooding piping the red and
black faces are omitted.


THE TECHNIC.
EDITORIALS.
We have endeavored to present our Technic to its readers as early as
have the boards of the last two years. However we have found the com-
pilation of the data and material for the Alumni Register to be an enor-
mous task, and as we wished to offer it with as few errors as possible we
have delayed the publication so as to make the records more complete.
The account of our Alumni who took part in the late American-Spanish
war will be of interest to all our engineering graduates. It shows that
our department took no small share in aiding the country both on land
and on sea.
In presenting the Register of Alumni we have followed in the steps of
the board of the '96 Technic. It has been impossible in the short time
that we have had to do the work to make the list absolutely perfect anil
complete. As for its merits we will let the Register speak for itself.
Upon the suggestion of several prominent alumni we have published the
names in alphabetical order instead of by classes as was done in the
former list, believing this will greatly facilitate reference.
The question of procuring prominent engineers from various sections
of the country to speak before our Engineering Society has been very
strongly advocated this past year. The successes attendant upon the
lectures by Prof. A. H. Sabin and Mr. Walter B. Snow would seem to
indicate that such a movement would certainly be in the right direction.
Let our Alumni help the Society in this undertaking and do all they can
to bring themselves or to persuade others to appear before our meetings.
The president and other officers of the Society would be very glad to
correspond with any who have their services or suggestions to offer.
The scheme to change the publication of The Technic from an annual
to a quarterly has been brought forward this year as in past years. The
Engineering Society, however, is very reluctant to take the step at pres-
ent, although with sufficient encouragement from the Alumni and Faculty
such a step might be advantageous to all concerned.
The Technic is indebted to the Alumni Association of the University
for valuable assistance lent the board in the preparation of the Alumni
Register and the War Article.
We would reHpectfully request our readers to pay special attention
to our advertising pages. The firms represented in this issue are of the
highest standing and it is to their patronage that the success of Tkt
Technic is largely due.

During the evening a committee that had previously been appointed
to consider a permanent organization, reported, recommending the
organization of the Chicago Alumni Engineers' Association of the Uni-
versity of Michigan. They were to have no constitution nor by-laws but
should have two objects, one being to hold two social affairs annually,
and the other being to help the Engineering Department of the University
in every way possible. The furtherance of these objects was to be left
in the hands of two officers, one a president with power to appoint com-
mittees, and the other a secretary-treasurer, who should act as a high
grade technical agency in helping engineering graduates desirous of
locating in the vicinity of Chicago to secure employment. The com-
mittee's report was unanimously adopted and Mr. Robert P. Lamont, '91,
chosen as president. The secretary has not been chosen as yet.

CIVIL ENGINEERS IN THE U. S. NAVY.
E. P. GOODRICH, '98.*
What need has our Navy of civil engineers?
At first the question puzzles most persons, but when one becomes
acquainted with the organization of that department of our Government
having to do with the sea, the answer is apparent.
The Secretary of the Navy is one of the close advisers of the chief
executive of this nation, and represents before him and before Congress
that branch of the federal organization called the Navy Department.
As everyone knows that department has charge of the building and
repair of war vessels. Naturally, it also oversees the equipping of those
vessels with engines and boilers, with mechanical signals and flags, with
guns and ammunition, and with men to run them. It must care for the
physical welfare of these men in time of war and in time of peace. To
♦Civil Engineer, U. S. Navy.


carry on and properly supervise these various phases of its work, the Navy
Department has established Bureaus. Thus, there are the Bureaus of Con-
struction and Repair, Equipment, of Steam Engineering, of Navigation, of
Medicine and Surgery, and of Supplies and Accounts, each intrusted with
the class of work which its name implies. Many of the things coming
under cognizance of each of these Bureaus are readily distinguished in a
real or imaginary visit aboard any of the vessels belonging to our navy
as they sail the high seas. But a day comes when each vessel must stop
to replenish her supply of coal, of ammunition, of food, perhaps of men,
and even the most perfectly made must often undergo repairs to her
machinery, her equipment, or her gigantic, complex self. Her sides must
be scraped and painted or perhaps repaired, her armament increased, or
her armour thickened, and her frame strengthened to carry the added load.
In order to accomplish, to the best advantage, these and many other
ends, the Government has established navy yards and naval stations upon
the sea coasts of this country and her different possessions. There are at
present along the sea board of the United States fourteen such yards and
stations, and Cuba, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Guam, the Samoan Islands, and
the Philippines each have a naval rendezvous. Those on the home shores
are at Portsmouth, N. H, Boston, New London, Conn., New York, Phila-
delphia, Washington, Norfolk, Port Royal, S. C, Key West, Dry Tor-
tugas, Fla. ,Pensacola, Fla., Algiers, La., San Francisco and Puget Sound.
Some of these places are especially equipped as coaling stations, such as
the ones at New London.f Key West, Dry Tortugas, and the one on the
Samoan Islands. Others have extensive docking facilities, such as the
New York Yard with its three miles of water front lined with concrete or
stone quay walls and its; several dry docks, two now in use, one being
reconstructed, and one under consideration with money appropriated by
Congress for its construction.
Some yards are equipped principally with shops for repairs or con-
struction work. The immense Government gun shops are located at the
Washington Yard, and the New York Yard is so fully equipped that sev-
eral men-of-war have been constructed upon the ways there. The Maine
was launched from them not many months before her fatal trip to Cuba.
fFor a description of this plant see Eng. News, Vol. XLIII., No. 3,
p. 38, Jan 18, 1900.

Some yards serve as great reservoirs of supply. Almost daily ship-
ments are made from the acres of floor space in the storehouses at the New
York Yard to some distant point,—the Philippines, Guam, Hawaii or
Puerto Rico; and there are located the factories where are made the gar-
ments for all the sailors of our navy, the factory from whence comes the
flags for all the ships, the factory where the green coffee is roasted and
packed for shipment to all our boats, the shops where is made much of
the metal furniture used aboard our battleships, and many other important
navy necessities.
Some yards have extensive barracks for enlisted men, the one at Ports-
mouth having been equipped within a few days with accommodations for
1.600 Spaniards, prisoners from the battle of July 3, 1898.
After every cruise each war vessel has to be taken to some navy yard
where she may be "docked" for thorough overhauling in order to maintain
the wonderful efficiency which has won world-wide respect and admiration,
and to save our Government millions of dollars which would be necessary
to replace the rapidly wearing out vessels should this constant care be
relaxed. As a vessel approaches her destined port and comes within the
•jurisdiction of one of these stations, her officers must be sure that no shoals
exist upon which she may ground. Wharves and sea walls must exist,
beside which she may tic up to unloa-d her excess of stores, and from which
she may again be replenished. Buildings must be available to contain
these stores, and railroads and streets must exist along which to approach
them. Devices must be at hand for removing and loading coal and ammu-
nition. Heavy cranes must be provided to take the vessel to pieces if nec-
essary, and shops be near where repairs can be quickly made. Dry docks
must be there into which the vessel can go and be made dry and approach-
able on all sides. Then, too, the shops must be heated, lighted and pro-
vided with power. They must be kept in perfect repair, and new ones
must often be designed and constructed. The streets must be lighted,
paved and drained; the sea walls and docks and railroads must be repaired
when damaged, and must constantly be extended by new construction.
To care for all this multifarious work, connected with the various navy
yards, there exists under the Navy Department, one bureau called the
Bureau of Yards and Docks. In the body of regulations drawn up for
the regulation of the navy is stated that "the duties of the Bureau of Yards
and Docks shall comprise all that relates to the construction and main-

walls and buildings of all kinds, for whatever purpose needed, within the
limits of navy yards, and naval stations * * * .It shall prepare the
plans and make the estimates for the above structures.
(2) It shall repair and require for furniture for all buildings in navy
yards.
(3) It shall be charged * * * with the purchase, sale and trans-
fer of all land and buildings connected with navy yards, and shall also be
charged with the care and preservation of all monuments of title to lands
acquired for naval use.
(4) It sihall provide light and water for all buildings, or for what-
ever purposes they may be needed in navy yards; and shall require for all
fuel, except that which is used by other bureaus.
(5) It shall have charge of all landings, derricks, shears, cranes,
sewers, dredging,' railway tracks, cars, wheels, trucks, grading, paving,
walks, shade trees, enclosure walls and fences, ditching, reservoirs, cisterns,
fire engines and apparatus * * * .
(8) It shall determine upon and require for all the tools, stores, mate-
rials, means and appliances of every kind required fbr its own purposes, and"
erect and repair the same.
(9) It shall superintend all work done under it * * * .
(11) It shall estimate for, and defray from its own funds, the cost
necessary to carry out its duties as above defined * * * .
(13) It shall have charge of the installation and maintenance of tele-
phones within the limits of navy yards or stations."
It is immediately evident from this that the Government requires the
services of men educated in that most conglomerate of all professions—
Civil Engineering. The first civil engineer to do any extended work for
the Navy Department was Laomi Baldwin, who, with several others, was
employed in 1828 to consider the construction of the first dry docks. There-
after, whenever thought necessary, the services of professional civil engi-
neers were secured to carry on the various engineering enterprises required
by the constantly increasing navy. On July 5, 1862, an act was passed by
Congress whereby a civil engineer was to be constantly with the Bureau
of Yards and Docks at the Navy Department in Washington, D. C. In
1867 Congress granted a civil engineer to each navy yard and station as
was necessary to their welfare. At the beginning of 1872 eight such engi-


neers were employed, and in that year two more were appointed, the two
now standing at the head of the list of civil engineers in the navy—Rear
Admiral Mordecai T. Endicott, now Chief of the Bureau of Yards and
Docks, and Captain Peter C. Asserson, now in charge of the work at the
New York Navy Yard.
Up to 1871 the civil engineers were merely civil employees carried on
the civil lists in the offices of the paymasters of the navy. In 1871 Con-
gress passed an act providing relative rank for those holding civil engi-
neering positions, but the President did not confer such rank until Feb-
ruary 24, 1881. There are at present twenty-one members in the corps,
the number having been limited by law in 1899.
Whenever vacancies occur through death, resignation, retirement or
additions authorized by Congress, examinations are held of all those pre-
senting themselves. Young men are eligible who are between the ages of
twenty-five and thirty-five, who have graduated from a reputable engineer-
ing school, and who have had three years practical experience. The exami-
nations of late years have been rather tedious and exacting, covering gen-
eral physique, education and experience. The educational test covers Eng-
lish grammar, composition .arithmetic, algebra, geometry, analytical geom-
etry, trigonometry, calculus, both differential and integral, theoretical me-
chanics, hydraulics, geology, mineralogy, engineering materials, drawing,
topographical and mathematical, specifications, civil engineering, strains in
structures, retaining walls, dry docks, marine railways, sea walls, floating
docks, machine shops, power plants, water works, sewers, railroads, pave-
ments, chimneys, wharves, quays, bridges, electrical apparatus and methods,
steam engines and water wheels, pumps, etc.
Any branch of engineering is delightful to one enthusiastic about his
profession, but should so many of its different phases present themselves
to an engineer in rapid succession, he cannot but be happy over his pro-
fessional lot. And this is the lot of a Navy Civil Engineer.


THE TECHNIC.
PARTIALLY BRACED FRAMES:-PORTAL BRACING.
PROF. CHAS. E. GREENE.
The analysis of a trestle bent when the bracing extends only a portion
of the distance from the top to the foundation is less simple than the dis-
cussion of ordinary frames,'because bending moments are caused in the
posts when a horizontal force, such as wind pressure or centrifugal force, is
applied in the plane of the bent a,t or above its top. The same action takes
place in the end or intermediate posts of a bridge, since the portal or other
bracing occupies only the upper portion of the bridge cross-section.
The first case considered is represented by Figure i. Here the posts
are supposed to be practically hinged at the bottom, so that no moments
exist at A and B; the inclined braces are ties. As the given external
force H, at E, may act from either side, the two posts will be of the same
cross-section, and hence will have the same stiffness to resist horizon-
tal bending towards the positions
h shown by the dotted lines. There-
fore the bending moments and
shears will be alike in the two, and
the horizontal components of the
reaction at A and at B will be
% H. The frame F C D G re-
mains rectangular.
Let H = 12,000 lbs. and the size
of the bent be as marked.
The bending moment M at F
(or G) in the post, since there is no
moment at A, will be pxAF
=: 84,000 ft. lbs., which will call for
a force at C to balance it with an
arm C F. 84,000 6 = 14,000 lbs.
at C. The horizontal force at F
will be equal and opposite to the
sum of those at top and bottom, or
20,000 lbs. This force must be the
thrust of the piece F G.
As the horizontal component of
the tension in C G must supply
this thrust in F G and must also exert an equal force on the post B D at G,
the horizontal component of tension in C G = 40,000 lbs. and the tension
1^4
itself = 40,000 XCG-rFG = 40,000 -—. — 44,700 lbs.
(No te.—In Figure 1 the force at C should be j4,000, not 4.000
be the same as the one below l\ in Figure 7.-Ed.)
The dotted line should

Of the 40,000 lbs. of horizontal tension brought by G C to C, 14,000 lbs.
will be taken up by the post at C, as shown above, as reaction or shear to
bend the post, and 26,000 lbs. will be left to compress C D. Of this com-
pression, 14,000 lbs. again acts against the post at D, and the remaining
12,000 lbs. balances or is caused by the given external force H.
There remain to be found the stresses in the posts. Take moments
about A or B for the horizontal force H. Compression in A C or tension in

add such load as may be carried on the trestle,
is carried by a track centrally placed on C D, the
Compression in A C — 30,000 -f- 20,000 = 50,000 lbs.
Tension in B G = — 30,000 -f- 20,000 = — 10,000 lbs.
By moments about C, stress inGD=HxDE~C D=l2,ooo.|S
= 10,000 lbs. tension. The 20,000 lbs. of load on that post will change
the stress in G D to 10,000 lbs. compression.
The difference between the stresses in B G and G D must be the verti-
6
cal component of the the tension at G of C G, or 44,700.— = 20,000 lbs. .
The bending moments at different
points of C D depend upon the points ,2.000,0 -3000
where the load is placed and upon
the magnitude of H and its arm D E.
The reduction of D E to zero and the
removal of the vertical load will bring
this case to that of portal or interme-
diate bracing between two bridge
trusses, if the posts are thought to be
hinged at their lower ends. As H
may come from either side, the range
of stress in each post may be seen
from the above results The bending
moment of 84,000 ft. lbs. at F and G
must not be overlooked in designing
the posts.
If the design is like Figure 2, it is evident that either set of diagonals,
C K D or F L G, will brace the upper rectangle. As the force of 12,000 lbs.
at D might, at another time, be applied from the opposite direction at C,
each one of the diagonals must be designed to resist compression as well
as tension, and will be of the same size. Hence it will be a reasonable
assumption that each set offers the same resistance to the distortion of the
rectangle.
Then, by moments about B, as the post A F carries 12,000 X 18 12
= 18,000 lbs. compression, the vertical components in F L and C K will be
9,000 lbs. each, and the compression in F C becomes 9,000 lbs. As the
diagonals slope at 45° with the horizontal, their horizontal components must

also be 9,000 lbs. The tensions and compressions in the diagonals will be
o.ooQ X 1414 — 12,700 lbs.
As C K supplies 9,000 lbs. horizontal tension at C, and 12,000 lbs. is
needed there, shown by the dotted arrow, to balance the 6,000 lbs. reaction
at A, as explained in the case of Figure 1, C L must supply the remainder,
or 3,000 lbs. tension as marked. At L, as indicated by the arrows below
K, F L brings 9,000 lbs. of horizontal thrust and L G 9,000 lbs. of horizontal
tension; hence, for equilib-
,Moo tiWoo h rium, L D must have 15,-
000 lbs. compression. This
compression at D, to which
is added 9,000 lbs. of hor-
izontal component in K D,
is balanced by 24,000 lbs.,
made up of 12,000 lbs. ex-
ternal force, and 12,000 lbs.
reaction or shear which the
post D B requires as it re-
sists the external force.
The same analysis gives
the stresses marked on the
lower horizontal member.
One must not be satined
with the moments and stresses obtained unless they give equilibrium and
thus check at all points. soothe ^ ^_
A similar case will be the em-
ployment of three panels of 45°
bracing, as shown in Figure 3.
Note that the stress in the middle
panel of the lower horizontal mem-
ber is zero; and, as the two diag-
onals in each panel balance in
stress, the top and bottom mem-
bers in each panel give a resultant
stress of + 6,000 lbs., being the
half of H that must be transferred
to the left post.
tf two knee braces, F L and L
G are employed, Figure 4, the pro-
portions of the frame being as in-
dicated, the horizontal force at F
and G is 18,000 lbs., which will be
the horizontal component in F L
and L G. The stress in the upper segment of the post becomes zero, and
the stresses in the horizontal member are as marked.
A modification of this frame, shown by the addition of the dotted mem-

FIG . 5
bers C I, I K and K D, is used as a bridge portal. Since the compression
in A F and the tension in B G must be 18,000 lbs., and the vertical com-
ponent of the stress in F I, caused by the necessary horizontal force of
18,000 lbs. to be applied at F, is 18,000 lbs. compression, the stress in F C
must be zero. Therefore C I, and
similarly D K, are without stress,
or there would not be equilibrium
in a vertical direction at C and D.
Hence C 1 and .D K, as also I K,
only serve to stiffen F L and L G.
If knee-braces are put in the
corners, with a space between
their upper ends, Figure 5, the
forces developed in the frame and
those tending to bend the horizon-
tal member are as indicated. The
horizontal component of the stress
in the knee-brace being necessar-
ily 36,000, as marked at F, the ver-
tical component will be the same
in this example; so ttat the com-
pression + 18,000 lbs. in A F is fol-
lowed by 18,000 lbs., tension in F *'00,4 A
C. This pull downward at C and the equal upward thrust at D make a
couple with arm C D, which is seen, by the sketch at C D', to balance the
couple 36,000 X K L, caused by the two knee-braces. The bending action
on C D is considerable.
It is very apparent, from Figure 5, that slender knee-braces will not
suffice to carry a horizontal external force down the frame; and the top
lateral bracing of a bridge must ordinarily transfer most of the wind
pressure to the portals, as the knee-braces are generally too light to do
more than stiffen each panel.
Many trestle frames have the bases of posts firmly bedded or fixed
by anchor bolts, so that bending moments will be resisted at those points.
The posts of Figure 6, if so constructed at A and B, will tend to assume
the dotted reverse curves indicated, under the action of H at D. The tan-
gents at A and B remain vertical, and the frame CDGF in moving to
C F' remains rectangular, so that the deflections FF' and CC, of the
points F' and C from the vertical tangent at A, must be the same.
The method of expressing proportional deflections by area moments,
developed by the writer in his "Graphics," will enable one to find the
bending moments at A and F with little trouble. The method has many
useful applications to a variety of problems, and is much more tractable
than is mathematical integration.
The bending moment diagram for the post A C, if it was hinged at A
and C and had the force applied at F, that actually comes through G F,
would be the triangle N P R. Let the maximum ordinate P S of this tri-

angle be denoted by M. The true diagram, when the post is fixed and
restrained at A, is the shaded area, the bending moment at A being O N =
M„, and at F being PQ = M,.
Let N S ~ a and S R — c. Then the deflection F F' from the tangent
at A is proportional to
Triangle N P S . 1 a — (Triangle O N Q . f a + Triangle N Q S . * a) =

If the dimensions of the frame are as marked on the sketch, and H =
12,000 lbs., M0 = 54,857 ft. lbs., and Mi = 41,143 ft. lbs. Then the shear or
horizontal force needed at the upper end C of the post is 41,143 -f 8 =
5,144 lbs., and the horizontal force supplied by the strut at F must be 6,000
+ 5,144 = 11,144 lbs. The horizontal component in the diagonal tie will
therefore be twice that amount, or 22,288 lbs., since the post at G must
alsobe .acted upon with the same force as at F. The tension in the tie
itself will be 22,288- { J = 25,070 lbs. The compression in the upper strut
is 22,288 — 5,144 = 17,144 lbs.
The compression in A C is the vertical component of the stress in C G,
or 22,288- ft = 11,144 lbs. The tension in B G will be the same in amount.
Any vertical load on C D will be carried by the two posts, as usual. The
correctness of the stress in the posts, and hence of the other quantities, can
be checked by moments about one of the points where the bending moment
is zero; that is, at M0-:- i H = 54,857 -:- 6,000 - Q.14 ft. above A or B.
Then 12,000(24 — 9.14) : 16 ~ 11,145 ",s-


A frame may also be braced at three points of attachment to each post,
as shown in Figure 7. This bracing is a combination of Figures 3 and 4.
Let the three successive divisions of the posts, from the base up.be denoted
by a, b and c, and suppose at present that the posts are hinged at their
bases. Each post will tend to bend into the curve shown on the left, under
the given horizontal component of the reaction, 1H, and the unknown
forces P,, P2, and P„ applied by the

is P,c and at P3 is 1 H a, as marked.
Suppose a tangent to be drawn

inclined pieces, multiply by 1,414.
The compression in the left post is H . 6 ~ 3 = 2 H at the lower end.
The horizontal component in the knee-brace being P3 = 3 H, the vertica,
component is also 3 H, which changes the stress in the next division of the
left post to a tension of H. The upward thrust of the knee-brace at K

must be resisted by C K and K S. R L and K S must have equal stresses
of opposite kinds, as they bear similar relationships to the two sides of the
frame. Further, the stress in R F must be equal and opposite to that in
R L, to assure equilibrium in a vertical direction at R. Hence stress in
F R = stress in K S. Let the vertical component of the stress in K C =
x, and that in K S or F R — y. Then, in going up the post.from F to C,
— i —y + x — o, ox y —x= — i.
At K,y + x = 3. . • . x — 2,y = 1.
The vertical component in K S is also one-half of the stress in the
lowest part of the post. The stresses must check in each direction along
the successive parts. Note that the stress in the middle division of the top
strut is again J H, and of the lower strut, zero, as in Figure 3.
If the frame carries a load, its effect can be added. If that load is
applied at R and S, it will probably be transferred to the posts through the
trapezoidal truss F R S G. If H is applied above D, the treatment is
similar.
If a = 3 /', b — c, distance between posts = a, and H — 12,000 lbs., the
forces are,
Pi = 4,500; P2 " 27,000; P3 — 28,500.
C R = — 14,000; R S = + 6,ooo; SD = -f 26,000.
F K = — 37,000; KL = o; L G = f 37,000.

DESIGNING A BOILER.
The methods of determining the sizes of the several pieces and con-
necting parts, and of computing the section of a post subjected to trans-
verse force, are treated in the writer's Structural Mechanics.
DESIGNING A BOILER FOR SPECIAL CONDITIONS OF
SERVICE.
FKALN'K M. DUNLAP, '85.
During the summer of 1899, the writer was called upon for an opinion
in a case which finally involved the design of a boiler under conditions
which made necessary a departure from the recognized methods of fixing
its proportions by the horse-power to be developed.
In this article it is proposed to discuss the conditions governing the
choice of the form of engine recommended, and the successive steps in the
design of a boiler suitable for it. It is not intended to give computations
in any other than a very general way, or to follow the design down to
details.
A coal unloader, or machine for handling coal in-car-loads from cars
to vessel, at one of the Lake Erie ports had been in successful operation
for several seasons, and was to be rebuilt on substantially the same lines,
but increased in size to be capable of receiving cars of the largest size. The
machine in question was of the type where a loaded car is run from an ele-
vated track into a cylindrical steel frame, where it is secured by clamps, and
the whole is rotated, by rolling the cage up an inclined track till the coal
is poured out of the car into a chute leading to the hold of the vessel, when
it is allowed to return by gravity to its first position where the empty car
is released and pushed out by the entering loaded car.
It will be seen that the demands for power are short, very heavy, and
at quite irregular intervals.
It was assumed, of course, that steam would be the motive power, but
some uncertainty was felt as to the manner of its application. In the old
machine steam was used in a horizontal, direct, single-acting cylinder, mov-
ing sheaves over which wire cables were reaved and carried around the
IH'riphery of the cylindrical cage so as to roll it on its inclined track.
On account of the large maximum, and comparatively small average,
power demanded, it seemed as if some better mode of application of power


i5
ought to be arranged for the new machine, possibly some form of power
storage which would allow the prime mover to run almost steadily at the
average rate and the power to be given out for vise as needed.
It was in discussing the various modes of applying power in regard to
their adaptability that the boiler design here referred to came up for con-
sideration. Besides steam, electricity, compressed air, and hydraulic press-
ure had been proposed for the operation of the new machine.
With the design of the structure w"e have nothing to do. It is a pat-
ented device and the new one is only an enlargement of the old.
A few days spent in watching the old machine in operation showed that,
when handling lump coal, a car every minute and a half was practically
the maximum speed, and that only for short periods. In handling large
coal it is necessary to roll the cage up a second and often a third time to
dislodge what has landed on the braces and to clean out the car thoroughly.
As nearly as could be measured, the distribution of this work was six
seconds for rolling up and nine for rolling down and stopping at the bot-
tom, six seconds and nine alternately for the'second and third roll, amount-
ing to forty-five seconds, followed by forty-five Seconds or more of rest
while changing cars. This cycle could be repeated indefinitely, except as
the work on the boat or the supply of cars necessitated longer stops.
When handling small or slack coal, however, about one car per min-
ute was the maximum speed. The record, so far as heard, was twenty-
nine cars of slack in twenty-seven consecutive minutes. With slack less
care is necessary in handling, and only one roll of the cage, or at most two,
is sufficient for each car.
All estimates for the new machine are based on maintaining the same
speeds with the heavier loads to be handled.
The inclined track of the new machine will rise 7 feet on a base of 22
feet, giving a track 23 feet 1 inch long.
The weight of the cage, as given by its designer, will be closely 75
tons, or 150,000 pounds. The largest coal cars now carry 100,000 pounds
of coal and weigh 36,000 to 40,000 pounds. Allowing 10,000 pounds for
contingencies, considering the car and its load another 150,000 pounds, we
have a total of 300x00 pounds to be rolled up the incline and brought to
rest in six seconds,—one-tenth of a minute.
The center of gravity of the cage is not far from its center of figure,
and the new ioc.ooo-pound coal cars arc so high that no material error will


THE TECHNIC.
be made by considering the center of gravity of the whole to lie in the axis
of rotation.
Now an elementary consideration of the balance of forces and the solu-
tion of a simple proportion give us a force of 90,000 (say 91,000) pounds,
applied through the center, parallel to the inclined track, as the force re-
quired to maintain the load in equilibrium.
But it must be moved 23 feet 1 inch from rest back to rest again in
six seconds, and its maximum velocity will be twice the mean, or such as
would carry it 23 feet 1 inch in three seconds.
The force of gravity acting freely on a body for three seconds will pri-
duce a velocity of 96.6 feet per second; and to produce in three seconds, in
a body which is in equilibrium under external forces, a velocity of 7.69 feet
per second, we must add a force in the direction of the desired motion
which is to the weight of the body (or force of gravity) as, the desired
velocity is to that produced by gravity. This calls for an accelerating force
of 23,882 (say 24,000) pounds added to the 91,000 required to maintain
euqilibrium.
There are additional resistances due to the stiffness of cables, rolling
the load on the track, and friction of a pin rack placed beside the track and
meshing in pin holes in the circumference of the cage.
These resistances, while not 'by any means negligible, are probably
small in comparison with the other forces involved on account of the slow-
ness of motion and size of the rolling cable. They are, moreover, so diffi-
cult to separate and estimate that any attempt to compute them would be
of very doubtful value. As a good, fair, lump-sum allowance is to be pre-
ferred to an uncertain computation, which might give a false sense of se-
curity, we will allow for them and any other small resistances by adding
10,000 pounds to the combined supporting and accelerating forces, making
125.000 pounds in all, with the probability that the error, if any, is on the
excess side. This force is to be applied through wire cables anchored in
the framework, passing under and around the cage and over the head
sheaves, down to the engine located in the lower part of the structure.
The force to be applied to the cables will therefore be half of that com-
puted from the center, and will operate through double the distance; that
is, 62.500 pounds 46 feet 2 inches.
We are now in position to discuss the adaptability of the various forms
of motor proposed for handling the machine.


17
From the foregoing, the expenditure of power demanded is 62,500
pounds at a rate of 461.6 feet per minute (46.16 ft. in 1-10 min.) =874
H. P. exerted for 1-10 minute.
In the case of a car of lump coal the two rolls which succeed the first
will require less power, since approximately 100,000 pounds of the load has
been discharged. Making a proportionate reduction, the next rolls call for
582 H. P. for 1-10 minute each. Averaging these over il/2 minutes, we
have,an equivalent of about 136 H.P. used continuously. This is sufficiently
high, for even on a half hour's run the cars are more apt to average 2 min-
utes than 1V2 minutes apart, the latter being about the shortest interval.
But if we should get thirty full cars of slack in half an hour, they would
generally require but one roll each, and 874 X 1-10 min. averaged for I
minute — 87.4 H. P.
The difference between this and the 136 H. P. above, will provide for
such of the latter cars as need rolling up a second time to clear them out.
From the fact that it offers us a choice between generating the power
on the spot and obtaining it from a commercial plant producing power on
a large scale, electricity would at first sight seem to 'be a very desirable
medium for the application of power. But, when we consider the great
maximum power called for and its short duration, the wiring from a com-
mercial plant would be very heavy.
If the electricity were generated on the spot, there would be required
either a generating plant equal to the maximum power required, and lying
idle between times, or a plant equal in capacity to the average requirement
(136 H.P.) with a storage battery of great size and cost. In the case of the
battery there would be danger of damaging it by discharging so much
power so suddenly.
An 875 H. P. motor, too, would be very expensive, and there are doubts
whether or not ao large a motor would stop and start quickly enough to be
available.
Compressed air, on 1the contrary, offers special facilities for storage of
power, for an engine of average power can run steadily compressing air
into a storage tank from which it can be used in large or small quantities
as needed. It is also free from condensation, which is the chief difficulty
with steam when used intermittently. But, since the pressure of confined
air is approximately proportiinal to the amount compressed into a given
space, the pressure will vary as the air is drawn off for use. Now in order
2


THE TECHNIC.
to keep this variation within limits of pressure at which it can be used, we
must either use exceedingly high pressure for storage and draw off for
use through a regulating valve, or provide so large reservoir capacity that
the amount drawn off at any time will be so small a portion of the total in
storage that the pressure will not fall below workable limits.
The use of high pressure storage will involve increased expense for
high pressure compressors, reservoirs and controlling valves, and a con-
tinuous expense for compressing to a pressure much higher than that at
which it can be used; while the other alternative calls for a tank or reser-
voir so large that it may be objectionable on account of cost, or space occu-
pied, or both.
Hydraulic pressure offers more advantages on some accounts than
compressed air. It has the same facility of storage, the pumps for handling
it are less expensive Uhan air compressors, and it is, of course, equally free
from condensation losses. The fluid is practically incompressible and
therefore must be stored under a movable ram with weights to give it
pressure. This fact affords us an advantage over compressed air in that
the pressure remains sensibly constant till all that has been stored has been
used. The incompressibility of the fluid has also one disadvantage in that
as much power must be used for a light load as for a heavy one.
The availability of hydraulic pressure with accumulator storage, as
well as of compressed air, will depend on the relation between mean and
maximum power and the regularity of the intervals at which power is
required. It will readily be seen that if two or more demands for maxi-
mum power are made at intervals so short that the prime mover has not
had time to restore under pressure the fluid drawn off, we must have
storage capacity under pressure sufficient to supply the necessary demands
and permit the pumps to overtake the demand during succeeding longer
intervals.
In order to inquire into the question of storage capacity, let us assume
the use of a pressure well within the range of good practice, say 2,000
pounds per square inch. We require a pull of 62,500 pounds travelling
46 feet 2 inches; or, by reaving the cables so as to multiply the motion of
the piston two, or four, fold, we may use a piston effort of 125,000 pounds
through 23 feet 1 inch, or 250,000 pounds through 11 feet 61/2 inches. Using
the latter for the sake of compactness, we have a piston area of 125 square
inches, which, travelling 138^ inches, sweeps I7.3I2-S cubic inches at each


19
stroke. Now, since the product of pressure and volume is a measure of
the work done, this volume will be the same, so long as we'keep the press-
ure constant, whether we use the fourfold or twofold reaving of the cables.
We must provide for three strokes of the piston in one half of the
cycle of operation, and none in the other half. Our storage accumulator
ram must then have a displacement equal to three cylinderfuls, less the
amount that will be pumped from the beginning of the first to the end of
the last action of the cycle. This portion consists, as before shown, of three
strokes, six seconds each, and two returns nine seconds each, equal to 36
seconds, in the whole cycle of 90 seconds; and a simple computation givea
us 31,130 cubic inches, 51,938 cubic inches less 20,808 cubic inches, as the
capacity of the accumulator.
Here again we may choose between large area of ram with heavy
suspended weight and short stroke, and a small ram with high lift and a
proportionate reduction of suspended weight. The choice would depend
wholly on circumstances of the case, available room, etc. If we should
take an area as large as 250 square inches (nearly 18 ins. dia.) the required
stroke would be 124 inches, or, for safety, say II feet. With stuffing box,
guides, etc., this will need headroom of 25 to 28 feet which may easily be
had in the structure. This will require suspended weights of 500,000
pounds to give the pressure assumed. And it is perhaps worthy of note
in passing that, with the same travel of the ram, the weights to be carried
would be the same no matter what pressure is assumed, except as influenced
by frictional resistance of the plunger. This is evident, since it is work
we .are storing, and, with a given limit of motion, the same total force must
be applied to perform the same work.
This system would give a very compact plant of machinery, easily
handled and free from liability to damage. Its adaptability would depend
principally on the cost of the accumulator and its foundation. In this case,
as the location is directly on the river bank and dock, a suitable foundation
for 260 tons or more of concentrated load might prove very expensive.
All the systems above discussed have contemplated the use of steam
boilers with engines or pumps running more or less continuously at mean
rate storing up power to be expended at intervals in large amounts.
The desired result could be attained by the use of steam direct, as in
the old machine first referred to, if steam would admit of a proper storage,
and the difficulty of cylinder condensation could be done away with. In


THE TECHNIC.
the old machine, cylinder condensation was one of the chief difficulties and
sources of loss." But there the cylinder was only fairly lagged with non-
conducting covering, and, being single-acting, the rear or outboard end
was left open so that the air was freely drawn in and driven out at each
stroke, thus carrying away a large portion of the heat of the cylinder wallj
during the time that the piston stood still at the end of the stroke.
Cylinder condensation cannot be avoided entirely in any cylinder act-
ing intermittently, but it may be very much reduced by taking extra pre-
cautions with cylinder covering, making it double or triple thickness, with
one or two dead air spaces between; and, in a single-acting cylinder, instead
of leaving the end open, fitting it with an end or stopper which, while it
would not seriously interfere with the passage of air to and from the cylin-
der, would act as a regenerator, taking up heat from the outgoing air and
heating that which takes its place at the next stroke, so that less heat would
be carried away from the cylinder walls. This might be made of any per-
manent and porous material as wire gauze or woven mats of loose asbestos
cord, etc.
Steam, after being formed, can only be stored to a very limited extent
and then only at the expense of adding external heat to repair losses by
radiation, etc. But water may be used to a considerable extent as a me-
dium for storing heat under favorable conditions, and the present case
seems to present conditions which will enable us to use a body of water
for that purpose and thereby simplify the plant to a very considerable
degree.
We know that if a body of water under pressure is heated to a tem-
perature corresponding to that pressure, and then the pressure lowered in
any way, a portion of the water will be turned into steam. The heat which
becomes latent in the process will be supplied by the body of water present,
and will be sufficient in amount to form enough steam to restore equilibrium
between a new pressure and its corresponding temperature, both of which
will be slightly lower than the original if no heat has been added, or if
insufficient heat has been added to make up for that drawn off in lowering
the pressure. If heat has been applied during the process in quantity suffi-
cient, or nearly sufficient, to make steam equal to that drawn off in the same
timej then, if the demand for steam be stopped suddenly, the pressure will
rise to or above the original and may become dangerous.
If wc so proportion a boiler that the furnaces, grates, tubes, etc., are


21
adapted for supplying to the water heat at a rate equal to the average
demand for power, and containing a body of water sufficient to supply,
without too great a fall of temperature, the heat necessarily becoming
latent in supplying steam enough for two or three successive rolls of the.
cage, we will have secured our power storage in a manner to permit its
application to the work direct without the use of intermediate machinery.
This saving due to the greater simplicity of the machinery avoiding
the losses incidental to changes and transfers of power, as well as the less-
ened capital and maintenance accounts and the slower depreciation, will
probably many times offset any losses due to unavoidable condensation.
Now if we proportion the strength of our boiler for a maximum press-
ure of 200 pounds per square inch, and take a cylinder of sufficient area to
do its work with a pressure of 175 or 180 pounds, we may draw steam from
the boiler in any needed quantity and the accumulated heat in the water
will supply any excess of the demand over the supply furnished by the fire
during the same period. This may 'be repeated, each time at a slightly
reduced pressure, until time enough can be permitted for the furnace to
again catch up with the demand, or until the pressure falls too low to be
effective.
The same consideration which led to the selection of the short cylin-
der, with the fourfold reaving of the cables, for the hydraulic system will
cause the selection of the same style for the use of steam direct, with the
added consideration that the short, large cylinder will reduce the area of
exposed cylinder walls as compared with a longer, small one, and thus
diminish radiation and condensation.
As shown in the discussion (page . .) we will require a pull of 62.500
pounds through 46 feet 2 inches, 125,000 through 23 feet 1 inch, or 250,000
pounds through 11 feet 6l/2 inches. Assuming the latter, we find that for
an initial steam pressure of 180 pounds per square inch the area of the
required cylinder will be 1,389 square inches, nearly, or 42^ inches diam-
eter. We may reave our cables over fixed sheaves on one end of the cylin-
der and cross-head sheaves at the other, passing the cables around the
cylinder lengthwise and using the piston rod in compression, or we may
place the fixed sheaves on a separate support beyond the cross-head sheaves,
throwing the piston rod in tension. The rod itself is under better condi-
tions in tension and less length of cables will be needed, but the stresses are
more self contained, less thrown onto the framed structure, when the rod


THE TECHNIC.
is in compression. There is also a slight difference in compactness in favor
of the latter. The advantages are about even, and we will assume that
the position with the rod in tension has been chosen.
If we could develop its full strength in fastenings, etc., we could use
smaller, but probably about a 5J/2-inch rod -will be used in such a cylinder.
And since it passes through the steam space we must increase the area of
our cylinder by 23.75 (say 25) square inches to compensate for it. giving
a gross area of 1,414 square inches, nearly 42V2 inches diameter.
The net stroke (or ?4 travel of pulling cable) will be 11 feet 6l/2 inches.
The fact that the accelerating force allowed for can act only in the
first half of the stroke will permit us to economize fuel and reduce the
capacity of the boiler by cutting off steam before the end of the stroke.
The force required at the end of the stroke is only sufficient to maintain the
equilibrium of the cage and empty car, which, as we have seen, is only
about twojthirds of the similar force for full load, or 60,600 pounds; re-
duced to the piston, 121,000 pounds. This is so nearly half of the starting
force that we may safely figure on cutting off at 54% of stroke, or spy
6 feet 3 inches.
The amount of steam to be furnished at working pressure by the
boiler for each stroke will therefore be (i,395 sq. ins. net area 9.69 sq. ft.)
9.69 square feet X 6.25 ft. = 60.56 cubic feet, or, per cycle of 1^2 minutes,
181.68 cubic fett at 180 pounds pressure. This will require the evapora-
tion of 181.68 X -433 ~ 78-67 pounds of water, or at a rate of 3,147 pounds
per hour.
Since it is desirable to use the small sizes, or slack, of Ohio or Western
Pennsylvania coal, we may assume an evaporation of 7 pounds of water
per pound of coal, with feed water taken at ordinary temperatures from
the city mains.
The average theoretical heat value of seven representative kinds of
Ohio coal is equivalent to the evaporation of 14.41 pounds of water from
and at 212° F. This equals about 11.63 pounds from 32° into steam at 180
pounds gauge pressure. A boiler efficiency of 60% to 70% reduces this
again to from 7 to 8.14 pounds, from which 7 pounds seems reasonable for
bl;.ck or three-fourths coal.
3,147 pounds of water at 7 pounds requires 450 pounds of coal per hour.
Now since l slow uniform rate of combustion is desirable for heat storage
we will assume a rale of 15 pounds per square foot of grate per hour.


23
This calls for 30 square feet of grate, and consequently a little less than
4 square feet (576 sq. ins.) of cross-sectional area of tubes. If 4-inch
tubes are used this requires 52 or 53 tubes, and smaller tubes should not
be used for bituminous coal unless necessary.
At a xate of .3,147 pounds per hour, we will evaporate during 3 sec-
onds (time of admission of steam to the cylinder) about 2.62 pounds of
water, leaving some 23.6 pounds to be supplied from storage at each filling
of the cylinder.
According to our proposition (page . .) the boiler pressure is to be
200 pounds gauge, reducible to not less than 180 pounds. Since it is desir-
able that the fluctuation of pressure should be as little as possible at any
instant and at a maximum we must take three cylinderfuls from the boiler
with very little opportunity for restoration, we will assume a fall of not
more than 5 pounds in the pressure" at each draft.
The temperature corresponding to a pressure of 200 pounds is 3880 F.,
and to 195 pounds is 3860. Each pound of water present can therefore
furnish two B. T. units, and to supply the latent heat of evaporation for
23.6 pounds of water will require 23.6 X 842 -4- 2 — 9,936 pounds of water,
more or less.
Since water at this temperature may safely be assumed to weigh about
50 pounds per cubic foot, we must provide water space equal to 198 (say
200) cubic feet. As any excess over this amount will only tend to improve
the regulating effect of the heat storage, we will get as much water space
as the type of boiler selected will permit.
The efficiency of heating surface is largely dependent on the type of
boiler adopted, and therefore we will determine the ratio of heating sur-
face to grate surface when we have selected the general type of boiler.
In order to prevent foaming or disturbance of the water level by too
great a rush of steam when the throttle is opened, a broad water surface
for disengagement of steam and as large steam room as possible should
be provided. The steam room should, if practicable, be four or five times
the volume of the cylinder to the point of cut-off. or say 240 to 300 cubic
feet. This may be attained by the use of a steam dome or drum, if needed,
with the added advantage of taking steam from a point higher above the
water line and lessening the chances of entrained water entering the cyl-
inder.
The choice of a type of boiler will be largely influenced by the locality


THE TECHNIC.
in which it is to be used. The difficulty of getting foundations for set-
tings, etc., will sometimes determine the use of brick settings or internal
firing, and the requirement of large water space and broad disengaging
surface practically limit us to some type of shell boiler. And since in
this case the boiler must be placed on a pier or dock, it is probable that a
boiler of the cylindrical marine, or Scotch, type will fulfill as many of the
conditions as any.
Since the length of grate is limited in any case to five or six feet by
the difficulty of firing, we must, in order to get 30 square feet, use two
furnace flues 30 inches diameter inside. This will make the length of grate
6 feet.
If we use the corrugated flues which are usual in this style of boiler
their outside diameter-will be about 2 feet 10 inches.
In order to have ample water and steam space, let us try a shell 9 feet
in diameter inside of outer plates, and by the use of extra large flange radii
so place furnace flues, tubes, etc., that the minimum water space between
them and the shell, and up through the center, shall be six inches.
Using a separate combustion chamber or back connection for each
furnace and placing 26 4-inch tubes in each, we can get a spacing of 5
inches, centers vertically, and 6 inches, centers horizontally.
Since the combustion is intended to be slow, the heat required to pro-
duce draft will not be great, and we will expose to the water as large heat-
ing surface as can be obtained without unduly increasing the size of the
boiler, say 30 square feet per square foot of grate, or 900 square feet in all.
This is as great as in marine boilers of this type where the consumption of.
coal per square foot of grate is much higher.
If we make the combustion chambers 2 feet long, front to back inside, .
each presents a heating surface of 47 square feet, leaving 403 to be
obtained in flue and tubes for each furnace. The flue, with a mean diam-
eter of 2 feet 8 inches, exposes 8.35 square feet, and the 26 tubes 26 square
feet per foot of length. 403 — 34.4 requires 11.71 feet, say II feet 9 inches
length of flues and tubes. This gives tubes rather short for their diameter
and their efficiency as heating surface would probably be increased by
using spiral retarders in them.
With 6 inches water space between the combustion chamber and back
head, this fixes the length of the boiler at 14 feet 6 inches, which allows
3 inches to be distributed where needed when deciding on details, thickness
of plates, etc.


25
When carrying the water line 3 inches above the combustion cham-
bers we have 20.66 square feet of section in the steam room, which multi-
plied by 14 feet 6 inches gives 299 cubic feet of steam room.
The volume of a 9 feet by 14 feet 6 inches cylinder, less 299 cubic feet
and the volume of flues, tubes, and combustion chambers, gives 367 cubic
feet water space. This is 1.8 times the computed amount necessary, though
hardly as much as could be desired for regulating over long periods, but
since it satisfies the conditions we have laid down as necessary, and the
relative volumes of steam room and water space can be altered to a con-
siderable extent by changing the water level, we will leave the fluctuations
in longer periods to be cared for by manipulating the fires.
By the use of a smaM steam dome to give the steam outlet sufficient
height above the water level the water could be carried even a foot higher,
reducing the steam room and increasing the water space by about 122
cubic feet each. Still leaving the steam room equal to about three cylin-
derfuls and making the water 489 cubic feet, or about 2V2 times the com-
puted amount.
Of course, in making use of heat storage in the water, special attention
must be given to preventing loss, of heat by radiation from the boiler, and
herein lies one of the disadvantages of the type of boiler chosen; for,
instead of being enclosed in the brick walls of a setting, it must be cov-
ered with non-conducting material for that purpose solely. It is probable
that a covering made of Ij4 or 2 inches of plastic asbestos or magnesia
compound with wire netting spaced out to form an inch of closed air
space, covered with an inch or more of hair felt and a metal or canvas
jacket, would prove thoroughly effective.
We have now followed the case through all the considerations which
determined the choice of a motor, and have worked out the elements of a
boiler suitable to supply steam to that motor by storing the excess of heat
from a moderate fire during periods of inaction and giving it out as needed
for short periods of heavy demand for power.
We have determined on a boiler of the Scotch marine type with mod-
erate grate surpace, slow combustion, large ratio of heating to grate sur-
face, large steam room, and a large body of water for heat storage.
The remainder of the design presents nothing but the usual details of
strength of materials and arrangement of riveted joints, and we need not
follow through them.


THE TFXHNIC.
TRANSIT ADJUSTMENTS AND TESTS.
J. B. DAVIS, '68.
1. PLATE LEVELS.
a. REM. If found much out, partially adjust the worse one first.
b. DIR.
Preparation.—Set up the transit firmly and level it carefully.
Test—Reverse the transit about its spindle. See if the bubbles read
level. Reverse the transit back to its first position. See if the bubbles
again read level. Repeat these trials, making the necessary corrections in
the setting, or levelling, of the transit, till the bubbles will surely read level
again when the transit is returned to its first position. Then reverse the
transit, as at first, and note the deviations of the bubbles from level
readings.
Correct, by estimation, one-half the deviation of a bubble by means
of the screws that fasten the level tube to the plate
Level the transit carefully again. Test the adjustment as at first.
Repeat the corrections and tests, in this manner, till no deviation appears
when the test is made.
c. Rem. Check screws upon the adjusting screws of the level tubee
(sometimes placed in the end plugs of the level tubes) must be released
before making the correction. These check screws-keep the level tubes
longer in adjustment, but may give annoyance in making the adjustment
Do not screw them too tight. Test the adjustment and see that it is correct
after the screws are set.
The vernier plate and the limb plate may not be parallel in their
motions. This may be tested by first adjusting the plate levels about the
spindle with the plates clamped; then releasing the plates and clamping
the spindle: and finally testing the adjustment of the plate levels about the
axis of the vernier plate. If found out of adjustment with respect to the
motion of the vernier plate, after carefully repeated trials, it shows that ths
two plates do not revolve about the same axis. Leave the plate levels in
adjustment with respect to the spindle if the principal work is running
straight lines, and reversion on the spindle- If reading angles is the prin-
eipal work, leave the plate levels in adjustment with respect to the motion
of the vernier plate. 'In case this defect is serious the transit should go to
its maker and be recentered.
Should it be found impossible to adjust the plate levels, after repeated
careful trials, about either axis of motion, it shows that axis of motion with
with respect to which this difficulty exists, to be badly damaged. Usually
the maker must fix it. Make this test after the transit has had a fall.
2. LINE OF SIGHT. CLOSED WYES.
a. COND. A place to set the transit in is needed where well-defined,
fixed marks can be readily found on opposite sides of it at a distance away


27
as great as the telescope will show them clearly. It is well to have the
marks at about the same angular distance, above on one side and below on
the other, from the place chosen. The plate levels should be in adjust-
ment, and the reversions of the transit made about the axis .they are
adjusted for.
b. DIR.
Preparations.—Set up^the transit firmly in a suitable place. Level it
carefully. Set the line of sight on a distant, well-defined, fixed mark.
Reverse the telescope about [the transit axis and find a similar mark in
apparent line. Turn the telescope back and see if the line of sight strikes
the first mark. Repeat these pointings, making the necessary corrections
in the setting and levelling of the transit till the line of sight will surely
strike the first mark again when the telescope is turned back.
Test.—Release the necessary clamps and reverse the telescope about
both axes. Level the transit if the levels show a slight disturbance. Set
the line of sight on the first mark. Reverse the telescope about the transit
axis and see if the second mark is in apparent line. Turn the telescope
back to the first mark, as before, and, by the same means, make sure the
line of sight will strike the mark. Then reverse the telescope, as at first,
and note the deviation of the line of sight from the second mark.
Correct, by estimation, one-fourth of the deviation of the vertical cross
wire by means of the screws at right angles with it that hold the cross wires
in the telescope tube. Whether the telescope shows objects right side up,
or not, turn these screws as if to increase the apparant deviation. Loosen
the screw permitting the desired movement before turning the other.
Leave the screws under a gentle, even, strain. If the deviation is large,
loosen the other pair of screws slightly, but have a care not to get the ver-
tical cross wire inclined.
Set the line of sight again upon the first mark, as at first. Repeat the
tests, corrections, and tests till no deviafion appear when the test is made.
c. REM. This adjustment is required theoretically in reading angles,
but not in running straight lines. It conforms to the best working condi-
tions, however, both optically, and in the field practice.
3- STRIDING LEVEL.
a. DIR. ADJUSTING.
Preparation.—Set up the transit firmly. Level it carefully by the plate
levels, or disc level. Bring the [transit axis over a levelling screw. Clamp
the spindle. Place the feet of the striding level on the bearings for them
on the transit axis. Level the striding level with levelling screws to the
transit. See that it stands freely on its feet, and remains level.
Test.—Carefully lift up the striding level, reverse it, and replace its
feet to the bearings, without jar. In the same manner return this level to
its first position. See if the bubble again reads level. Repeat these rever-
sions, making the necessary corrections in the setting or leveling of the
transit till the striding level bubble will surely read level again when


THE TECHNIC.
returned to its first position. Then reverse the striding level as at first,
and note the deviation of the bubble from a level reading.
Correct, by estimation, one-half of the deviation by means of the
adjusting screw, or screws, at one end of the level tube, provided for a ver-
tical adjustment.
Set the striding level, by means of the levelling screws of the transit,
to read, and stand, level again. Test the adjustment as at first. Repeat
the corrections and tests, in this manner, until no deviation is shown by
the test.
b. REM. In making this adjustment stand the striding level verti-
cally over the bearings. Do not incline it. If inclined it may show this
adjustment apparently imperfect. This requires a second adjustment side-
wise to bring the axis of the level tube into a plane parallel to the line of
the points of support of the feet of the striding level.
c. DIR. Adjusting sidewise.
Preparation.—Make the last adjustment as perfect as practicable.
Test.— Incline the striding level slightly on its feet. Return it to its
first position. See if the bubble again reads level. Incline it in the oppo-
site direction about the same amount. Return it again to its first position.
See if the bubble again reads level. Repeat these trials, making the nec-
essary corrections in the setting or levelling of the transit, till the bubble
will surely read level again when returned to its first position, and stand at
the same reading when inclined. Then incline the striding level, as at first,
and note the deviation of the bubble from a level reading. Incline it a like
amount in the opposite direction and note the deviation.
Correction.—By means of the screws for a sidewise adjustment set the
level tube so it will show the same deviation in the same direction for the
same inclination either way from its vertical stand, when tested as above
described.
d. REM. The bubble should read level in all three positions. If it
does not the bore of the glass tube is not uniform, and it should be replaced
by a perfect one at the first opportunity. In using such a striding level
be very careful to stand it plumb on its feet.
This adjustment, and the preceding, need to be made alternately
together when first the bubble tube is attached to its base.
If, for any reason, the bubble tube has to be disconnected from its base,
loosen but one of the sidewise screws and notice how tight it is. Likewise,
if there is a check screw to the vertical adjustment, leave it alone,—only
unscrew the adjusting screw. When the bubble tube is again restored to its
connections with its base it can be set almost in its proper place by bring-
ing the loosened screws to their bearings again, and not require so much
adjustment.
4. TRANSIT AXIS TRUNIONS. ROUNDNESS,
a. DIR.
Preparation.—Separate the transit axis from the telescope. Clean its
trunions and their bearings in the wyes of the transit. Set up the transit


zg
firmly in a place of an even temperature. Level the transit carefully.
Clamp the spindle so the transit axis will stand over a levelling screw.
Place the transit axis in its wye bearings. Stand the striding level on the
transit axis with its feet on the trunions. Level the striding level carefully
with the levelling screws to the transit. Reverse it and put it in adjust-
ment. Level the striding level carefully again and see that everything is
stable, and steady, so the striding level will stand level.
Test.—Lift the striding level off. Replace it carefully. See if it reads
level again. Repeat this test, making any corrections that may be needed
in the setting or levelling of the transit, or adjustment of the striding level,
or otherwise, till the bubble of the striding level will surely read level
again when replaced, and stand level.
Lift the striding level off. Turn the transit axis slightly in its bearings
Replace the striding level as before, —do not reverse it. Notice if it still
reads level. Remove the striding level; turn the transit axis back to its
first position; replace the striding level, as before; and see if it again reads
level. Repeat this test; make sure of the stability of the apparatus, and
of the reading of the bubble of the striding level after the transit axis is
turned.
So test the transit axis by turning it a little more at each trial till it has
been examined entirely round its trunions and returned to its first position.
b. REM. Whenever the striding level fails to read level in these
tests it shows that the trunions are not round.
Theoretically, this method will not show which trunion is not round,
but in practice a marred trunion is easily found by looking for the defect
shown by the striding level, fn any case this method may be used to prove
the trunions to be round. By providing a support for one foot of the strid-
ing level while the other rests on a trunion, that trunion can be examined
separately. Usually the transit axis must go to the maker to be refitted,
and the transit may have to go with it. The finest transits must always go
to the maker for this defect to be removed. The trunions of the transit
axis of a transit of not as fine a grade have been smoothed and made of
the same size by soft wood clamps, oil, flour of emery, and turning the
transit axis by hand, while a trunion was held in the clamps where the oil
and emery had been applied. This was so successfully done that the strid-
ing level in use with the transit would show no difference of any kind
between the two trunions. Such a thing is not recommended for general
practice, but may serve when nothing better can be done, except at a great
loss of time and much expense. When emery is used in any form about an
instrument, the utmost care must be taken to get rid of it all. It is so lia-
ble to do most serious injury to the moving parts that its use is prohibited
by many persons and tripoli, or even pumice, substituted. Nothing coarser
than flour of emery should ever be used.
5. TRANSIT AXIS TRUNIONS. EQUAL SIZE,
a. DIR.
Preparations.—Open the wye clips; take out the transit axis; and


THE TECHNIC.
clean the trunions and their bearings in the wyes. Set up the transit
firmly. Level it carefully. Clamp the spindle so the transit axis will
stand over a leveLling screw. Place the transit axis in its wye bearings.
Stand the striding level on the transit axis with its feet on the trunions.
Level the striding level, carefully, with the levelling screws of the transit.
Reverse it and put it in adjustment. Level the striding level again as at
first. See that everything is stable, and steady, so the striding level will
stand level.
Test.—Set the striding level off. Lift out the transit axis carefully,
reverse it, and replace it in the wyes without jar. Replace the striding
level without reversing it. Notice if it still reads level. Remove it as
before. Restore the transit axis to its first position without jar. Replace
the striding level. See if it again reads level. Repeat these trials. Make
sure of the stability of the apparatus and of the reading of the level when
the transit axis is reversed.
b. REM. If the level does not read level when the transit axis is
reversed it shows the trunions to be of different sizes. They must usually
be fitted by the maker, but may be treated as noted in 4. This method
tests for differences in size. Should a difference be shown, the trunions are
not made with precision enough for the striding level, or the level is too
sensitive for the transit.
Professor Durand's three-point calliper may be made to give still more
delicate tests for roundness and differences in size.
Theoretically this test will show whether the two trunions have a com-
mon axis. Practically, this defect would have to be so large as to be a dis-
grace to shops of the present day, for it to appear. Trunions are turned to
the same size, even when using the term size with rigid precision. That
is, the trunions are so nearly of a size that if the tests appear to show a dif-
ference, that difference is quite likely due to the errors of the test (obser-
vation, apparatus, temperature, etc.), instead of to the difference in size of
the trunions. Some very elaborate tests would seem to confirm this view.
A level bubble can be read with as much more precision, with a read-
ing glass than without as the graduations of the plate can.
6. LEVELLING THE TRANSIT AXIS.
a. DIR. Set up the transit and level it carefully with the plate levels.
Stand the striding level on the transit axis over a levelling screw. Level
the striding level carefully with the levelling screws of the transit. Reverse
it and put it in adjustment. Level the striding level as at first. See that
everything is steady so the striding level will stand level. Turn the transit
one-quarter round on its spindle axis and level the striding level again.
Turn the transit back to its first position,—do not reverse it. Level the
striding level. By repeated trials set the transit, by means of the levelling
screws, so the striding level will stand level in either position of the transit.
Test the striding level again for its adjustment. Repeat these operations
till the striding level shows the transit axis to be level in both positions of
the transit and itself is in adjustment at the final test.


31
b. REM. The transit axis will then be level, but the spindle axis will
not be vertical unless these axes are in adjustment. This adjustment is
given in 9. It may be tested and made at the time of levelling the transit
axis by the second method given for this adjustment in 9, f. Then the
transit will be completely levelled by means of the striding level. It will
be much more precisely set than any plate levels can set it. In the better
grades of transits, the plate levels are for approximate setting only.
7. LINE OF SIGHT. OPEN WYES.
a. COND. Select a place for making this adjustment in, from which
a well-defined, fixed mark can be seen when the telescope is pointed level,
or nearly so, and as far away as the telescope will show it plainly. Use the
striding level to the transit axis. The trunions of the transit axis must be
round, of the same size, and centered on the same axial line.
b. DIR.
Preparations.—Set up the transit firmly in a suitable place. Open the
wyes. Level the transit axis carefully with the striding level as directed in
6. Set the line of sight on a distant, well-defined, fixed mark, with the
transit axis levelled. Remove the striding level.
Test.—Carefully lift the telescope from the wyes; turn it over, the
objective directed towards the mark, and replace it in the wyes without jar.
Replace the "striding level and see if the transit axis still stands level.
Remove the striding level. Restore the telescope to its first position.
Replace the striding level. See if the line of sight again strikes the mark
and the transit axis is level. Repeat these trials, making the necessary
corrections in the setting or levelling of the transit, or the adjustment of
the striding level, till.sure that the transit axis stands level in both posi-
tions, and the line of sight strikes the mark in the first one. Leave the tel-
escope in its second position. Notice the deviation of the line of sight
from the mark.
Correct one half of this deviation by means of the cross wire screws at
right angles with the vertical cross wire, as directed in 2, b.
Set the line of sight again upon the mark, as at first. Repeat the pre-
parations, tests, corrections, preparations and tests, till the test shows no
deviation.
c. REM. This adjustment can be made in the way described in 2 for
closed wyes, when the telescope can be reversed on the transit axis.
8. AXES. CLOSED WYES.
a. Cond. The plate levels should be in adjustment. The line of
sight should be in adjustment. The objective slide should be in good
line. If the transit has a telescope level, or other delicate level, it should
be levelled by it as directed in 9, b or 10, b. In making this adjustment,
the telescope should be turned through a vertical angle of about 00°,—
from about 45° above, to about 45' below, the horizon.


THE TECHNIC.
b. DIR.
Preparations.—Set up the transit firmly near some high, well-defined,
fixed mark, so that when the telescope shall be directed to it the elevation
will be about 45°. Level the transit carefully, as above noted. Set the line
of sight on the high mark. Read, or estimate, the angle of elevation.
Direct the telescope at the same angle below the horizon, on the same
side of the transit. Find, or fix, a mark in apparent line. Turn back to
the upper mark and see if the line of sight again strikes it. Repeat the
pointings at both marks, making the necessary corrections in the setting
and leveling of the transit, and in the position of the lower mark, till sure
the line of sight will strike both marks with the transit carefully levelled.
Test.—Release the necessary clamps. Reverse the telescope about
both axes. Set the line of sight upon the upper mark. Notice if the tran-
sit is still level. If not it must be reset, the levels adjusted if need be, and
the whole preparations repeated. Having made sure of the setting of the
transit and the pointing of the line of sight, direct the telescope downwards,
as before, and find, or fix, a second mark in apparent line, with the same
care, and tests, used in locating the first mark. See if the two lower marks
are the same, or in exact line. Leave the telescope so as to show this.
Correction. — Move the vertical cross wire over one-fourth of the
apparent distance between these two lower marks, by raising, or lowering,
one end of the transit axis, by the device provided.
Prepare for and make a test of the adjustment, as at first. Repeat
these tests, corrections, and tests, till the test shows the lower marks in
the same line, or as one.
c. REM. This adjustment sets the axes at right angles with each
other. It, theoretically, enables one to measure correctly the angle between
the vertical planes of lines having very different angles of elevation.
9. AXES. OPEN WYES.
a. REM. The axes may be adjusted in the way given for closed wyes
in 8. This process involves levelling the transit with the striding level
independently of the adjustment of the axes, which adjustment is involved
in the usual process of thus levelling the transit. If the striding level
feet do not stand on the transit axis trunions, use the process for adjusting
the axes given in d below. If the transit has a delicate level attached it
may be levelled by that, according to the next paragraph, or according
to 10, b.
b. DIR. Levelling with the Transit Axis Striding Level. Set up
the transit firmly and level it carefully with the plate levels. Place the
striding level in position. Turn the transit on its spindle so the striding
level will stand over a levelling screw. Level the striding level carefully
with the levelling screws to the transit. Turn the transit one-quarter round
and level the striding level again. Turn the transit back to its first posi-
tion,—do not reverse it. Level the striding level again. Turn the transit
to its second position,—do not reverse it. Level the striding level again.


33
By repeated trials set the transit by means of its levelling screws so the
striding level will read level in either of these positions.
Reverse the transit on its spindle. Notice the reading of the striding
level. Reverse back again and see if the striding level now reads level.
Repeat these reversions, making the necessary corrections in the setting or
levelling of the transit, till the striding level will certainly read level in
the first position and return to the same reading always in the reversed
position of the transit. Leave the transit reversed. Note the deviation of
the bubble of the striding level from a level reading.
Correct one half this deviation by the vertical adjusting screw of the
striding level tube.
Repeat the levelling as first noted above, then the reversions, and
make any further correction that may be needed in the setting of the strid-
ing level tube by its vertical adjusting screw, as before.
Continue these operations till the striding level will read level in
both positions of the transit when it is reversed.
By the same means set the striding level so it will read level when
the transit is turned one-quarter round, and reverse as before.
Proceed with these experiments till the striding level is set to read
level in any position of the transit when turned around on its spindle, —or,
speaking theoretically, till the striding level will stand level during a com-
plete revolution of the transit on its spindle.
c. REM, The spindle will then stand plumb. The striding level will
be adjusted to the spindle and not to its feet by this process. Any such
delicate level on the transit may be similarly treated and used to level the
transit by. The telescope level, or the vernier level, being provided with a
slow-motion screw, may be set by that instead of an adjusting screw as
above described. This is detailed in io, b.
d. DIR. For adjusting the Axes. First Method.
Preparations.—Set up the transit firmly near some high, well-defined,
fixed mark, so that when the telescope shall be directed toward it the ele-
vation will be about 450. Level the transit as directed in b or in io,b. Set
the line of sight on the high mark, noticing the level to see that the transit
stands steady. Read or estimate the angle of elevation. Direct the tele-
scope at the same angle below the horizon, on the same side of the transit.
Notice the level again and see that it reads level. If not, repeat these oper-
ations till it does, and both transit and level work satisfactorily. Then
find, or fix, a mark in apparent line. Turn back to the upper mark and see
if the line of sigkt again strikes it. Notice the level again and see that it
reads level. Repeat the pointings at both marks, noticing the level, and
making the necessary corrections in the setting and levelling of the tran-
sit, also in the position of the lower mark, till sure the line of sight will
strike both marks with the transit carefully levelled.
Test.—Release the necessary clamps. Reverse the telescope about
both axes. Set the line of sight upon the upper mark. Notice if the tran-
sit is still level. If not, it must be reset and levelled as directed in b or in
3


THE TECHNIC.
10, b. Having made sure of the setting of the transit and the pointing of
the line of sight, direct the telescope downwards as before, and find, or fix,
a second mark in apparent line, with the same care, and tests, used in loca-
ting the first mark. See if the two lower marks are the same, or in exact
line. Leave the telescope so as to show this.
Correction.—Move the vertical cross wire over one-fourth of the appar-
ent distance between these two lower marks, by raising or lowering one end
of the transit axis by the device provided.
Prepare for, and make a test of the adjustment, as at first. Repeat
these tests, corrections, and tests, till the test shows the two lower marks in
the same line, or as one.
e. REM. The process of b, c and d, will reveal defects of construe
tion that can be shown by the striding level. For this reason the exam-
inations noted in 4 and 5 should be the first made. The process in b will
not show a difference in the size of the transit axis trunions.
f. DIR. For Adjusting the Axes. Second Method.
Preparations.—Set up the transit firmly and level it carefully with the
plate levels. Place the striding level in position. Turn the transit on its
spindle so the striding level will stand over a levelling screw. Level the
striding level carefully with the levelling screws to the transit. Remove
the striding level, reverse it, and replace it.'as in adjusting it. See if it is
much out of adjustment. If it is, adjust it approximately.
Level the striding level carefully with the levelling screws to the tran-
sit. Turn the transit one-quarter round and level the striding level again.
Turn the transit back to its first position,—do not reverse it. Level the
striding level again. Turn the transit to its second position,—do not
reverse it. Level the striding level again. By repeated trials set the tran-
sit, by means of its levelling screws, so the striding level will read level in
either of these positions.
Adjust the striding level by the process of 3, a as perfectly as possible.
Level the transit again, as above directed. Test the adjustment of the
striding level. Repeat these operations till sure the transit stands steady,
the striding level is in nice adjustment, and that it reads level in either
position of the transit.
Test.—Reverse the transit on its spindle. Notice the reading of the
striding level. Reverse back again and see if the striding level still reads
level. Repeat these reversions, making the necessary corrections in the
setting, or levelling of the transit, or the adjustment of the striding level,
till the bubble will certainly read level in the first position of the transit,
and return to the same reading always in the reversed position. Leave
the transit reversed. Note the deviation of the bubble of the striding level
from a level reading.
Correct one half this deviation by raising, or lowering, one end of the
transit axis, by the device provided.
Prepare for and make a test of the adjustment, as at first. Repeat
these tests, corrections, and tests, till the test shows the striding le\e!

always to read level. Last of all try the striding level for adjustment on
its own feet. If not in adjustment repeat the work.
g. REM This is the usual way of levelling the transit; levelling the
transit axes; adjusting the axes; and adjusting the striding level, all at
one time.
10. TELESCOPE LEVEL TUBE.
a. REM. Telescope level tubes are attached by nuts permitting a
vertical motion at each end of the level tube, and without any sidewise
adjustment, such as is commonly seen on the wye level, and on striding
levels. This makes it important that these level tubes be carefully set
by the maker, and that the glass bubble tube be placed, and fastened, in
its brass case with every care. Striding levels are used, fitting on collars
turned on the body tube of the telescope. These may be adjusted in every
particular. They are very easily attached and detached, will not fall off,
and can be used on the telescope when it is either side up. The ability to
completely adjust them makes them more desirable than the old form,
even if provided with a double ground bubble tube, reading either side up,
which is protected by a loose brass shell outside the brass case of the bub-
ble tube. All such bubble tubes should be scaled directly on the glass
itself, not by a brass scale standing over it.
This adjustment is for the purpose of setting the level tube, or the hor-
izontal cross wire, so the bubble will read level when the line of sight is
horizontal. With the level tube attached to the telescope body tube, as
first above noted, the level tube is adjusted and there is no very good way
of setting the horizontal cross wire in its best position in the telescope.
With the striding level standing on collars turned on the outside of the
body tube, the cross wires are adjusted and the horizontal wire brought to
its best position in the telescope. With the striding level no aid is required'
—one can make the adjustment alone.
To adjust the attached telescope level there are three principal steps.
First, levelling the transit with the telescope level. Second, setting the line
of sight horizontal. Third, setting the level tube and testing the adjust-
ment. This method of levelling the transit is necessary or the delicate
telescope level would be made to depend upon the plate levels.
b. DIR. For levelling the transit. Set up the transit firmly. Level
it carefully with the plate levels. Set the telescope level tube to read
level by means of the clamp and slow motion screw to the transit axis.
Reverse the transit on its spindle. Notice the telescope level reading.
Reverse back. See if the telescope level reads level again. If not, set it
to read level again. Reverse the transit again and notice the telescope
level reading. Continue these reversions, making the necessary correc-
tions in the setting of the transit and the telescope level, till if will cer-
tainly read level in the first position of the transit, and return to the same
reading always when the transit is reversed. Leave the transit reversed.
Note the deviation of the bubble of the telescope level from a level
reading.


THE TECHNIC.
Correct one half of this deviation by the slow motion screw to the
transit axis.
Level and reverse the transit again, as before.
Repeat these operations till the telescope level will read level in
either the first, or the reversed position, of the transit.
Turn the transit one-quarter round and level it again, as above set
forth.
By repeated trials, making the necessary corrections in the setting of
the transit and the telescope level, as above directed, make this level read
level for any position of the transit when turned on its spindle.
c. DIR. For setting the line of sight level. Level the transit as
above directed. Leave the telescope clamped. Measure off, each way
from the center of the transit, the same distance, say 150' or 200', and drive
a stake till firm, at the end of each measurement. Number these stakes 1
and 2. See that the transit is level and stands steady. Take accurate rod
readings on the tops of the stakes. Subtract the reading on 1 from the
reading on 2 and preserve the sign of the result, + or —. Call this
result k.
Move the transit to a place, a short distance, say 30', beyond stake I,
carrying the telescope clamped as last used. Set up the transit here and
level it as directed in b. Take a rod reading, r^ on stake 1 and another, r^,
on stake 2, just as the first ones were taken. Record these with their num-
bers. Find 12 — r,, noting the sign. Call this k'. See if k = k'. Make
sure of the whole work.
If k =k' the line of sight is horizontal and the level tube in adjust-
ment. If k' does not equal k, measure the distances from the transit's cen-
ter to stake 1, d„ and to stake 2, dz. Find a rod reading, R2, for stake 2 by
the following equation, observing all signs:
R2 = rj + d7^;d2 ("
Hold up the rod on stake 2 (set at this reading, R2, if a target rod), and
by means of the slow motion screw to the transit axis, set the line of sight
so it will give the rod reading, R2, on stake 2.
Test by taking a new rod reading, Rj on I. Find R2 — R„ observing
the sign of the rsesult. See if the result equals k.
Proceed with these trials and tests till the line of sight is set so that R2
— Ri at a test, equals k, or so near it that the experiments show it to be
useless to try further.
d. DIR. For setting the level tube. Set the level tube to read level
by means of the nuts at one end of it. Start that nut first that will permit
the desired movement Leave the nuts under a gentle even strain.
Test the level tube adjustment by additional rod readings and finally
set it so that R2 — Rj = k when the bubble stands level,— or as near this
condition as can be.
e. REM. If the ground is near enough level, drive the stakes so the


37
first rod readings on them will be equal. Then k = o. Proceed as above
directed after that, but use'the equation below instead of (i), observing all
Signs.
*« = '.-a; - a;(2)
With some experience in making this adjustment, probably the equations
will be dispensed with.
f. DIR. Double ground level tube. Adjust as directed in b, c, d, and
e, above, using but one side. Release the necessary clamps; reverse the
telescope about both axes; and set the line of sight horizontal by means of
the rod readings on stakes i and 2. See if the bubble of the telescope level
reads level. Repeat the observations and rod readings till sure the line of
sight is level, the transit steady, and the buble gives the same reading.
Note the deviation of the bubble from a level reading.
Set the bubble to read level by means of the slow motion screw to the
transit axis. Take a rod reading on stake 2,—the distant stake.
Move the horizontal cross wire by means of the screws at right angles
with it, that hold the cross wires in the telescope tube, and set it so the rod
reading on stake 2 will equal the half sum of the former rod readings on
this stake,—the one when the line of sight was level, and the one when
the bubble read level. Whether the telescope shows objects right side
up or not, turn these screws as if to increase the apparent deviation of the
second rod reading from the first. Loosen the screw permitting the desired
movement before turning the other. Leave the screws under a gentle even
strain. If the difference between the two rod readings is large, loosen the
other pair of screws slightly, but be very careful not to turn the cross wire
ring. Be certain the transit stands steady and the rod readings are correct.
Set the line of sight again level by means of rod readings on both
stakes.
Set the level tube to read level by means of the nuts at one end of it.
Start the nut first that will permit the desired movement. Leave the nuts
under a gentle, even strain.
Test the level tube adjustment by additional rod readings and final|y
set it so that R, — R, — k when the bubble stands level,—or as near this
condition as may be.
Release the necessary clamps, and reverse the telescope about both
axes. Set the line of sight level by rod readings on both stakes. See if
the bubble of the telescope level (now the same side up again as at first
adjusted) reads level. Repeat the observations and rod readings till sure
the line of sight is level the transit steady, and the bubble gives the same
reading. Note the deviation of the bubble from a level reading.
If this is considerably less than before, for the other side of the bub-
ble tube, make the same observations and adjustments for this side as
above detailed for the other.
Release the necessary clamps, reverse the telescope about both axes
*


THE .'TECHNIC
and make the test just above noted, anew for the side of the bubble tube
which is again uppermost.
Repeat these trials, adjustments, and tests, till the telescope level, and
the horizontal cross wire, are so set that the line of sight will be level when
the bubble reads level whichever side up the bubble tube may be,as shown
by rod readings on both stakes.
If persistant trial under favorable conditions of light, seeing, tempera-
ture, and steadiness, does not complete these adjustments so they will bear
the test imposed, or very nearly so, repeat the work and make these adjust-
ments so the two sides of the bubble tube will read the same (not a level
reading) when the line of sight is level. Record this reading, and fasten
it in the transit box.
g. REM. By these last adjustments the horizontal cross wire is set
nearer its proper place in the telescope tube, if not at that place. The
trouble of these adjustments shows the value of such a level tube in such
a place. Once the level tube is proven to be ground alike on both sides it
makes matters somewhat easier. Even with a perfect level tube there can
be no sidewise adjustment and the device is not nearly as perfect as that
of a striding level standing on collars turned on the body tube of the
telescope.
h. DIR. Horizontal cross wire. Striding telescope level.
Preparations.—Set up the transit firmly. Level it carefully with its
plate levels. Clamp the spindle so the telescope will stand over a levelling
screw. Clamp the telescope level,-—as shown by its striding level. Adjust
the striding level as directed in 3. Level the transit by means of the tele-
scope level as directed above in b. See, at the last, that the striding tele-
scope level remains in adjustment with respect to its own feet.
Direct the telescope to some object and find a mark on it in line with
the horizontal cross wire when the transit is carefully levelled by the tele-
scope level, and that level is in good adjustment. Prove the steps and
make sure the conditions are favolable.
Test.—Release the necessary clamps. Reverse the telescope about
both axes, and set it level as before. Be sure the striding level keeps its
adjusment. Note the deviation of the horizontal cross wire from the mark
it covered before.
Correction.—Move the horizontal cross wire by means of the screws
at right angles with it, that hold the cross wires in the telescope tube, and
set it so it will cover a place midway between the two marks above noted,
when the telescope is level.
Test the adjustment as at first. Repeat the test, correction, and test, till
the horizontal cross wire will cover the same mark with the telescope either
side up, and level.
i. REM. This arrangement of a telescope level is the best for
ge neral use. The same striding level may be made to fit the transit axis
also.


39
II. VERTICAL CIRCLE VERNIER.
a. REM. If the telescope is provided with a level, as above noted in
10, it may be put in adjustment, or the horizontal cross wire adjusted, as
directed in that section; the line of sight set horizontal; and the vernier of
the vertical circle set to read zero when the line of sight is level. This is
best, when practicable.
Some transits have a vertical arc in the place of'a full circle. Some
have two opposite verniers to the vertical circle, some but one. Some tran-
sits have two opposite verniers and two opposite sectors of a vertical circle
fitting these verniers. With opposite verniers an examination should be
made to ascertain if the verniers give readings at l8o° apart, or sufficiently
near so,—that is within a reasonable limit of instrumental precision, tem-
perature, perfection of construction, and closeness of reading considered.
This will be ascertained by taking numerous readings on different parts
of the circle, or opposite sectors, both direct and reversed, and comparing
them.
If the transit has no telescope level, and but one vernier to its vertical
circle, or the verniers and circle, or opposite sectors, are not well centered,
and in good working order, this adjustment must be made by the peg
method given for the telescope level in 10, c and d,—the levelling being
done by the plate levels. This adjustment then must depend upon the
least sensitive of the plate levels,—the one parallel to the telescope. To
provide against this, a delicate level is attached to the bar carrying the
opposite verniers, on transits having such, which is controlled by a slow
motion screw similar to the one used for the transit axis. This level may
be used to level the transit with, as directed in 10, b. These conditions
call for several forms of this adjustment, as was the case wirh the telescope
level. These are indicated above, except the one given below.
b. DIR. Full vertical circle. Opposite verniers.
Preparations.—Set up the transit firmly. Level it carefully by the
plate levels. Complete the levelling by the level for the verniers of the
vertical circle, if there is one, as directed in 10, b. Set the vertical circle
to read, Vernier A o° oo' oo" and Vernier B i8o° oo'oo''. Turn the transit
on its spindle; direct the telescope to some object; and find a mark in line
with the horizontal cross wire. See that the transit is steady and the levels
to be trusted.
Test.—Release the necessary clamps reverse the telescope about both
axes; see that the levels show the transit to be steady and levelled; and set
the vertical circle to read Ver. A 1800 oo' oo" and Ver. B o° oo' oo". Note
the deviation of the horizontal cross wire from the mark at first in range
with it.
Repeat the steps of this process till sure of the result shown. Leave
the transit so the telescope shows the deviation.
Correction.—Set the line of sight midway between its two pointings,
by means of the slow motion screw to the transit axis. Set the verniers by


means of their slow motion screw, or such other device as is provided, to
read o° oo' oo" and 180° o' oo", or one at o° oo' oo", and record the read-
ings of both. Fasten these last readings in the transit box.
Set the level to the verniers to read level, if there is one, after setting
to read o° oo' oo" and 1800 oo' oo" as above.
Test the adjustment as at first. Repeat the preparations, tests, correc-
tions, preparations, and tests, till the line of will strik the same mark which
ever side up the telescope may be when the verniers are set for a level
line of sight, and the transit carefully levelled, - or as nearly as can be to
these conditions.
12. LINE OF SIGHT.
If a transit has a telescope level attached to its body tube, it being in
adjustment in respect to the line of sight, and it is necessary to adjust the
vertical cross wire,as in 2, some work may be saved by levelling the transit
for that adjustment with the telescope level, setting the line of sight level,
and observing some mark in line with the horizontal cross wire, before
beginning the adjustment of the vertical wire. After the vertical wire is
adjusted set the horizontal wire on the same mark, first seeing that the
transit is as well levelled, as before, and adjust the telescope level to read
level again, in case it need it.
It is especially easy to derange the cross wires whenever all four cross
wire screws are loosened.
If the telescope level is a sliding level it is so little work to adjust the
horizontal cross wire that it had better be done instead of depending on
any such device as here given.
13. CENTERING THE EYE-PIECE.
a. REM. This is for the purpose of clear vision, as one might center
a magnifying glass more carefully over an object to be viewed. Fre-
quently there is no way provided for making this adjustment, and none is
needed.
b. DIR. Set up the transit where the telescope can be directed to the
light,—artificial lifght will do. By means of the four screws like, or sim-
ilar, to the cross wire screws, that hold the ring in the body tube of the tel-
scope, in which the inner end of the eye-piece slides, set that ring so the
cross wires divide the field of symetrically.
14 THE OBJECTIVE SLIDE.
a. REM. No adjustment of the objective slide should be needed. At
this point the skill of the maker should be manifest. A test is given below
instead of an adjustment. This test will indicate how perfectly the slide
is fitted, if the objective is well mounted, or how well the objective is
mounted if the slide is well fitted. Two imperfections may be present,
or but one of them. An adjustment does not correct the difficulty. It
partly hides it.


41
b. DIR. Let the transit where a row of stakes can be lined by it with-
out a motion of any kind except changing the focus of the objective.
Clamp the telescope securely with respect to all its motions. Line out a
low of stakes, at measured intervals of fifty feet, to 1,000 or 1,500 feet away.
Use a foresight, either at the end of the line, or beyond it, to keep the
transit steady by. Mark boints on these stakes precisely in line, and at
the measured distances apart.
Move the transit to the other end of the line and by trial set it so the
line of sight covers the end mark, with no motion but focussing the objec-
tive. Leave the telescope so clamped. Line a new set of points at the
same places as before. Note their deviations. There should be none,
theoretically.
This test is with respect to line. A similar test with respect to level
may be made by setting points on the sides of tall stakes in the line of the
horizontal cross wire. The horizontal cross wire cannot be easily set to
cover the end marks in the second position of the transit. Set the'tele-
scope, by means of the slow motion screw to the transit axis, so the line of
sight, by the horizontal cross wire, will pass at equal distances from, and on
the same side of, the end marks. Make a new line of marks. Measure
the spaces between these and the former marks. They should be equal,
theoretically.
AN IRRIGATION INVESTIGATION.
C. T. JOHNSTON, '95.
Irrigation is probably as old an art in the Western Hemisphere as it is
in the Eastern. Along the Salt River Valley in Arizona, in Southern Colo-
rado and Utah, and in northwestern New Mexico the traces of irrigation
works indicate an ancient civilization superior to that found by the Spanish
explorers. Water-ways were built and irrigation was practiced before the
advent of the Indian. The canals of these ancient peoples followed a grade
and conformed to other modern practice so closely that portions of the old
channels have been repaired and are used today.
The value of irrigated land does not inhere in itself, but in the water
which reclaims it from the desert. To make this value secure water must
belong to the land and not be dealt with as personal property, or in'any way
be effected by the doctrine of riparian rights. The prosperity of any people
largely depends on the stability of their titles to the property through which
they gain a livelihood. Land and water must go together to insure the sue-


cess of an irrigated country. In other countries where irrigation was prac-
ticed at an early date, land titles were comparatively definite and secure.
We have nothing to tell us how the original builders of these canals
governed the use of water; its division is a much more difficult task. Hence,
the character of the right to use it is much more uncertain. Not only does
it require engineering skill to measure the volume to be distributed, but
owing to atmospheric changes at the sources of supply, this volume fluctu-
ates. When we say a man or his farm is entitled to ten cubic feet of water
per second we may be allowing him a quantity which at times does not
exist. If he has an early or prior right to use water and yet has an inad-
equate supply, it is difficult to see where those having subordinate rights to
his come in.
Notwithstanding the antiquity of irrigation, but little is known as to
how much water is needed for the growth of crops under varying conditions.
Although this quantity has long been known to differ with soil, latitude, alti-
tude, character of crops, and even the quality of the water applied, yet no
measurements have been made until recently which begin the solution of the
various phases of the problem.
Nearly all disputes as to the ownership and use of water in Arid Amer-
ica have been settled by the courts. The courts have inaugurated no study
as to the needs of the irrigator; they have treated water the same as land
or personal property, without regarding the area it does or may serve to
irrigate, but have given more weight to the claims of the irrigators and the
carrying capacity of their ditches and canals. A student of the problems
connected with the supply furnished by streams, and the judicious division
of this supply among the various users, at once sees that they can only be
solved by engineering skill.
A stream has a public nature which the courts have long ignored. The
doctrine of holding water as personal property has resulted in sufficient
litigation in some of the states to pay for all the irrigation works con-
structed therein. This has been avoided in Wyoming and Nebraska by put-
ting the diversion and use of water under the charge of state engineers and
boards controlled by them. All adjudications are made by men equipped for
this particular work. When the rights to use water are to be established for
any stream, the available water supply is determined and each user of water
is allowed only what can be beneficially applied to the land.
This method of dealing with streams has practically eliminated all litiga-


tion in Wyoming and Nebraska. Since 1890, when Wyoming adopted the
present water law, there have been but two cases in the courts bearing on the
subject of irrigation. One of these has been held over since 1885. It has
been in all the courts of the state, and for the past fourteen years has been
a bitter personal fight between two irrigators. Recently the case has assumed
a new phase. This arose from an attempt on the part of one of the irrigators
to sell the surplus water the court had decreed him to an appropriator hold-
ing an inferior right. The case came on for trial, and the court, in the
face of all the good resulting from the contrary ruling, decreed that such a
transfer was just. This decision, if not reversed in the higher courts of the
state, will cause endless litigation, and the Wyoming law, althor^h good in
intent, will be of little benefit to the irrigator. No man's right will be
secure. The "irrigation lawyers" will absorb the profits from the farm. It
will permit speculators to buy up the water of the streams and destroy
homes which have been created and which depend wholly upon the water
supply for their value.. It is doubtful whether the time will ever come when
a man educated for another profession can do the work of an engineer.
It seems that the courts have not appreciated the facts which have been so
clearly demonstrated, and prefer to follow a doctrine which, when applied
to the problems relating to irrigation, results in unjust and vicious decrees.'
Permitting water to be bought and sold like live stock and held as a chattel
is well illustrated in a case which recently ended in the Colorado courts.
An early settler built a small ditch during the seventies, and claimed at
that time, in a statement filed in the county clerk's office, about one-half of
the flow of the stream. He could only use a small portion of this volume,
but as he did not know how much water he needed, and only had a vague
idea of what a cubic foot per second or miner's inch was, he made his claim,
large enough to be on the safe side. Later on homeseekers came from the
East and gradually used all the water of the stream during the irrigation
season. Not long ago the original appropriator brought a suit in the courts
in an attempt to recover the water claimed in his early statement. The case
was fought to the end by those who had invested their means in land made
productive by the application of water. The defendants submitted the best
evidence in their behalf, and able legal advisers were secured. However, the
court granted the plaintiff the amount of water claimed in his original
statement. The water which had been used for the irrigation of small farms
was diverted above and turned on to new land farther away from the stream.


THE TECHNIC.
Of course, there is no justice in a decision of this kind. It may be law,
but it is bad practice, and certainly not engineering.
It cannct be denied but that practically all of the court decrees have
been conscientiously rendered. The difficulty is that the courts do not
appreciate, and are incompetent to judge, the value of the engineering facts
which enter into every adjudication of the rights to use water. Every pro-
fession views a question according to the light afforded by special education
and practice Hence, where an engineer would apportion the water of a
FIGURE I.
stream to all the users in accordance with the amount needed, and the area
and date when first irrigated, the lawyer would adjudicate the rights of as
many as appeared in court and fix the quantity decreed to each according
to the facts presented by the irrigators, and a physician would probably diag-
nose the case and prescribe a course of treatment.
When water right questions were first appealed to the courts but little
was known as to the flow of the streams, the carrying capacity of the
ditches, the area irrigated, and nothing was known as to the quantity of


water needed. The court did not even appreciate the need of such facts to
make an equitable adjudication. It is not surprising-, therefore, that practi-
cally the same case appeared time and again in the courts, serving only to
enrich the "irrigation" lawyer and to impoverish the irrigator who hires him.
Every irrigator knows approximately how much water he uses for vari-
ous crops, but, since he has made no measurements, his information cannot
be put in words. Hence, a judge or other person adjudicating the rights to
use water in his locality cannot be aided by his knowledge. The want of facts
along this line, as well as the absence of other information relative to irriga-
tion, has led to the establishment of the Irrigation Investigations under the
Department of Agriculture. This office has started its search for truth
along many channels, yet that relating to the duty of water is the most im-
portant. A brief review of this work will make clear the methods adopted.
The first year's work deals with the measurement of water actually
applied to the land. One or more stations have been established in nearly
every arid state, and engineers have been employed to carefully watch the
measurements. There are two common methods for measuring running
water. The fundamental device is a flume, or box, placed in the ditch or
canal, giving the water a rectangular cross-section. The other method is by
the use of weirs. In small canals and ditches, where the conditions permit,
Cippoletti weirs have been installed. These weirs have their sides inclined
from a vertical line at an angle whose tangent is one-fourth. This modifica-
tion of the rectangular weir approximately allows for end contraction, and
reduces the formula of the rectangular weir
Q = 3-33 (L—.2h) h | to
Q = 3-3-^ Lhf
In many instances a weir cannot be employed. Where there is an excess
of sediment it has a tendency to settle back of the weir and destroy the rela-
tions which should exist between the depth flowing over the crest and the
distance from the crest to the bottom of the structure containing the weir.
Where the grade of the canal is small and the banks low, water cannot be
impounded, and one of the conditions for accurate measurements cannot be
fulfilled. Where a flume is used, the law which governs the relation between
the depths and the corresponding discharges is determined by making as
many gagings of the ditch as possible with different depths. In this way a
series of co ordinates are determined, one being the depths and the other


«
the corresponding discharges. • With these observations an equation can be
computed by means of the method of least squares, giving a special formula
in each case. Where flumes are properly constructed and installed the curves
are parabolic. No appreciable error would result if the general equation was
assumed to be
figure 2.
Q = Ly" + my + n,
where Q 1s the discharge in cubic feet per second, y is the depth in feet,
and L, m and n are constants which are determined in each case. It can be
seen at once from this equation and the equation giving the discharge of the
weir that the volume of water flowing in the channel depends on the depth.


47
If. therefore, a continuous record is kept of this factor, the results obtained
can be converted into the total discharge for the period covered.
Some work has been done in this connection during the past fifteen years
by the state engineers and experiment stations of the west. Several registers
have been designed for keeping a record of the depth, and they all do this
more or less imperfectly. I will not take space to describe these. Let it be
sufficient to say that they all have their faults. The most serious is that of
reducing the record of depth. That is, if the water increased in depth one
foot, some of the registers indicate it by a rise of one-tenth of a foot; others
in careful weir or flume measurements, hence a new register had to be
designed. This is shown in Fig. I.
figure 3.
It consists of a horizontal cylinder which revolves with the rise and fall
of the water. The mechanism for producing this motion is shown on the
right end of the cylinder. A clock running on guides parallel to the cylinder
keeps .account of the time and travels seven spaces in a week. With this de-
vice the exact fluctuations of depth are recorded at the time they occur.
Fig. 2 shows a sheet taken from the register.
At a glance the depth of water can be determined by any two-hour space.
From the discharge equations, either for the weir or flume, tables have
been prepared giving the volume of water in cubic feet per second for vari-


THE TECHNIC.
ous depths. This table has been converted into a second one which gives
the discharge for periods of two hours in acre-feet. The conversion is
made by dividing the numbers in the first table by 6.05, that is, by 43560 -r-
7200. The acre^foot is the most convenient unit for expressing large vol-
umes of water, and is used almost exclusively in this office. With these
tables and the register sheets which are sent in each week, the daily volume
used in the irrigation of various crops is determined. Tables are made
showing this volume in acre-feet, and from these tables diagrams are drawn
showing the facts graphically. A diagram (Fig. 3), shown herewith, repre-
sents the amount of water used near Mesa, Arizona.
The column at the right shows the total depth to which the land is
covered, including rainfall.
To make this work valuable, it must be continued for a number of
years. As soon as the amount now used is determined, the station will be put
under the charge of an experienced irrigator, and no water will be used
except that which aid? the growth of plant life. In this way the quantity of
water needed will eventually be determined. When this has been done for
localities of varying climatic conditions there will be a basis for a more
equitable division of the water of our streams. At least one of the excuses
now offered in defense of some of the ridiculous court decrees will vanish
with the publication of the facts deaiing with the duty of water. Those
disposed to consider carefully the needs of irrigation law and its adminis-
tration will, I believe, concur in the following statement:—
The work of finding the quantity of water requisite for the growth of
crops, the measurement of streams affording the water supply, and the
determination of the area of irrigated lands, must always be done by an
engineer. After he has collected the facts and has become acquainted with
the people and the local conditions as'the field work will demand, he should
be better qualified to fix the volume each man should receive than a judge
having a lawyer's education and an inclination to follow precedents.
HOUSE DRAINAGE.
A. B. RAYMOND, 'OI,
In considering the various causes affecting public health, house drain-
age cannot be omitted. To have a healthy community, we must have
healthy homes for the people. One essential requirement for such homes


49
is an abundant supply of pure air within them. To obtain this, poor ven-
tilation is one drawback, and the fouling of the air by that from our drains
is another requiring our attention. We know that those who live an outdoor
life are more vigorous than those who are confined indoors; also that as
soon as cool weather comes and our families are driven largely to indoor
life, sickness immediately increases, with little abatement until the warm
weather comes again. This indicates that the air we breathe, as well as
the food we eat and the water we drink, has its part in causing poor health.
Many think the contamination by air from our drains is very slight. This
opinion is evidently due to the fact that, drainage work being mostly con-
cealed, they are unaware of the conditions which actually exist.
Let me point out from experience some of these .sources and the
agency causing an inflow into the home from them. Ventilation to some
extent is taking place in all buildings by the escape of the warm air within
them. Every cubic foot of air thus escaping must be replaced by a corre-
sponding amount from some source, and it will always come in at the point
of least resistance. Any openings upon the drainage lines within the building
are the places from which contamination is invited. The most common to be
found are as follows:
First, privy vaults in close proximity 10 the house.
Second, direct communication with the main sewer by untrapped
connections within the building for hopper closets.
Third, cesspools under cellar bottom on account of using crock for
the main drain under the cellar floor to receive the soil waste of the
house. Stoppage is continually taking place from one cause and another
in this drain, and when such occurs the sewage finds outlet through the
joints of the crock under the floor. At the first soft spot in the earth that
it comes in contact with, a settling takes place, and the pool is formed.
This condition will often remain unknown for months before being dis-
covered. We have found several very bad ones the past winter, holding
from one to five barrels of house sewage.
Fourth, untrapped openings in the cellar into the main house drain
to receive the cellar wash. These openings are generally from two to four
inches in diameter, and this winter, in houses heated by hot air or steam,
we found the current of air coming in through them from the drain strong
enough to extinguish the flame of a candle held twelve inches above them.
This is a very common defect.

Eighth, if trapped, the seals are broken by syphonage from their own
discharge or from the discharge of other fixtures.
Ninth, unsanitary and unclean fixtures, especially water closets.
Tenth, loose, open joints of the plumbing pipes from poor workmanship.
Eleventh, unventilated toilet rooms opening into the living rooms.
Twelfth, openings left by careless workmen, such as changes in old
plumbing, and a failure to close the waste when a fixture is removed.
These are the most important and common defects from which contam-
ination comes.
There are se/eral methods to discover such places, and one of the best
is the smoke test, as by lit they are the most readily brought to notice.
The lines are filled with smoke by a machine manufactured for this purpose.
If there are any openings, the smoke will appear coming through them and
are easily found, as the smoke can be traced quicker to its source than
can an odor alone.
To remedy these and other evils which we find, steps are now being
taken by most places to have all drainage and plumbing work done under
municipal control. Without taking time to go into the details of our regula-
tions, I can point out the main requirements to be desired.
These should be that all drainage work shall be done under the
supervision and control of competent men chosen for this purpose; that no
drainage or plumbing work shall be covered or concealed until it has been
inspected and accepted by the regularly appointed inspector, after the regular
tests have been applied and the work has stood the tests to the satisfaction
of the inspector. The tests which are generally required are the water on
the rough work and the smoke on the final. The first part of the work"
requiring consideration is the drainage of the foundation walls and cellar
excavation. Upon the proper planing of these drains and the efficiency with
which this work is done will depend the sanitary condition of the cellar in
its freedom from dampness. This part should have careful supervision.


Too often it is left entirely to the drain digger, arid the best planned work
is spoiled by careless work on his part. The requirement here is that they
should be laid with a uniform fall to the outlet. The interior of the rain-
water drains shall have a smooth surface, and they shall be deep enough
to receive the cellar and fountain drainage. These drains, which are called
the subsoil and rain-water system, should not connect into the soil drain of
the house, but should connect into the main house sewer outside of the
house trap, being trapped just before entering (see ground plan) ; thus they
will be protected from any air entering them from the main sewer and the
ventilation afforded by the rain-water connections will keep the air within
them sweet and fresh.
The cellar wash and tile drains should connect into the rain-water
drains. The question may be asked, why not connect these lines directly into
the soil drain of the house? The reason is on account of the liability of a
stoppage in the house trap, which would cause the house sewage to back into
these drains, fouling the entire system, and the formation of cesspools under
the cellar bottom, as indicated in the defects to be found on old work.
In our cities they are generally under the cellar bottom on account of the
building occupying the entire ground space, and also on account of econ-
omy in the cost of digging. Whichever plan is adopted, the two systems
should be kept separate as indicated, and for the reason given.
Then there will be no fouling of the subsoil drains, as it is very rare,
indeed, that a stoppage ever occurs in the main house drain outside of the
house trap. They do occur, however, from faulty construction, careless
workmanship, and when the lateral or main sewer is not sufficiently deep to
carry off the drainage during a sudden storm without causing a backage
from being overtaxed by the surface drainage.
Next comes the soil drain of the house. To protect the building •
against gas from the main or lateral sewer, just before or after it enters
the house, a trap is put upon it, and this is called the house trap. (Sen
Figures I and 2.) This drain, commencing outside of the house, should
be of iron, continued under cellar bottom and extended up through the
buiiding above the roof with open end. To this, just inside of the house
trap, a conneciion with the outer air should be made foi ventilation.
This connection is called the fresh air inlet, or foot vent. By this con-
struction, a movement of the air is established through the soil system,
keeping the air comparatively fresh within the lines.


THE TECHNIC.


Next, the rooms of the building should lie protected from the air from
the house drains themselves, for even with ventilation going on within
them, the air in them is more or less foul from the soil which collects upon
the sides of the pipes. Therefore, all interior drainage pipes should be of
lead, steel., cast or wrought iron. When the pipes are in place ready for the
fixtures, and before being covered, they should be required to stand the
water test. After the fixtures are placed ready for use, the work should
be able to stand the smoke test. The manner of making the latter has
already been indicated. The water test is made as follows:—
When the rough work is all in ready for the fixtures, Che various open-
ings are securely closed and the pipes filled with water to the top of the
main soil stack extending through the roof. The water is then allowed
to stand for art hour or so to see if the level is maintained. If not, there is
a leak, and it must be found by search and remedied before the work is
accepted. This can be easily done before the work is covered. There are
ways to deceive the inspector in making these tests, and he should be one
who is up to the tricks of the trade. A good inspector is seldom caught,
for he has means to detect fraud, and he should always be on the lookout
for it.
Next comes the protection of the fixtures from air passing through
them from the drain when they are discharged. Each fixture must be sep-
arately trapped and every trap protected from syphonage caused 'by its own
discharge, or by the rush of the discharge of any other fixture. This is
generally done by what is called a system of venting to afford relief from air
pressure or suction. An independent pipe, the same diameter as the main
soil, is run parallel to it. either extended through the roof or connected
into the soil above the highest fixture, and into this connections are made
from the crown of each trap. Experience has shown that this system is not
always safe on account of these vents becoming stopped from various
causes. They are then a source of danger on account of fancied security
which does not exist. Much of the venting is now discontinued, and resource
is had to anti-syphon traps. In work properly designed, syphonage can be
largely avoided. The danger principally comes where the connections are
made into the side of the horizontal lines, or else into the heel of the lead
bend. Connections taken off the top are safe against syphonage on any
ordinary work.
For an illustration of the change in the style of work now taking place,


compare that in Figure I with that in Figure 2. These plates were taken
from the Christmas issue of the Plumbers' Trade Journal of New York,
1899-1900.
In conclusion, anyone who is about to build should consult with those
who are in charge of the plumbing and drainage work. Their advice
will often save useless expense and protect you from unsanitary construc-
tion. In any case, you have nothing to lose but everything to gain by so
doing.
SINKING A PNEUMATIC CAISSON AROUND A BRIDGE PIER
EDWARD M. ST. JOHN, '95.
Of all the methods in use to get a good foundation for heavy structures,
the pneumatic caisson method always seems the most interesting,-the most
wonderful. The idea of working one's way through water, mud, sand, rock,
etc., to a depth of over one hundred feet below the surface of the water,
and of keeping the water out of the way by means of compressed air, is one
of the triumphs of modern science.
When, therefore, a chance was given the writer to assist in sinking a
caisson, he was very glad to go, even though the country thereabouts had
a reputation of making all new comers sick with chills, fevers, etc. It was
about the middle of November, 1898, that the trip was made to Little Rock,
Ark. It was a night ride, and daylight came when we were about one hun-
dred miles northeast of our destination. The view was dreary, indeed.
At least one-half the country that we passed through was flooded with
water. Now and then we passed a shanty or cotton field, with some natives
standing around waiting for the waters to dry up. We were told that the
country was not flooded like this all the time. Finally Little Rock, the
"Rose City" as it is called, came in sight. The presence of some huge rocks
on the banks of the Arkansas River suggested the name "Little Rock" to the
founders. A much larger rock two or three miles up the river is called Big
Rock. Two of the bridges across the river at this place are owned by the
St. Louis, Iron Mountain &amp; Southern Railway Co. One of these consists
of four fixed spans, through Pratt trusses, and one swing span, making alto-
gether about twelve hundred feet of bridge. The piers are of stone
masonry resting on timber caissons sunk to the rock about forty-five feet
below low water line. These piers and bridges were built in about the year


57
1884-85. Shortly after being built, the pivot pier, holding up the swing span,
and one other pier, began to lean up stream. This threw the bridge out of
line, and it had to be moved back and wedges put under to level it up in
order to operate the swing span readily. The leaning continued, however,
till in the sumer of 1898 the top of the masonry overhung the bottom by over
a foot, and the turn-table drums had been moved over as near one edge of
the pier as it was safe to put it.
It was then decided to stop the leaning if possible, and the contract
was let to the Missouri Valley Bridge and Iron Works, of Leavenworth,
Kan., Mr. A. J. Tullock, chief engineer, and Mr. L. S. Stewart, superintend-
ent in charge. Work was commenced in September, 1898. A pneumatic tim-
ber caisson was to be sunk surrounding the pier. This part was of itself a
very difficult task, owing to the large size of the caisson, the swift current
and rapid rising of the water in the river, and to the materials encountered
in the bottom of the river.
As the caisson was to be sunk around a pier already built,-it could not
be put together on shore and floated into position, but had to be built
above water around the pier on a pile support and then lowered into the
water. As there were not more than five or six feet of sand overlying the
rock beneath the river bottom, the piles had to have an extra amount of
bracing to keep them upright. The load was to be quite considerable and at
a distance of about four feet above low water mark, making about forty-five
feet that the piles extended above the yielding sand in the river bottom.
This bracing was accomplished by making a loop of chain about eighteen
inches in diameter spiking it to the end of a 2"xi2"xi8" plank, then letting the
loop down around one of the piles with the plank held nearly vertical till it
was about fifteen feet below the water surface, and the loop being now
around both pile and plank, the top of the plank was brought over, tightening
the chain as it came, till the end of the plank came down alongside another
pile, where it was securely spiked.
The masonry pier is thirty feet in diameter, resting on a square timber
crib thirty-two feet on a side. The crib, which is an extension of the caisson
underneath, reaches up to within one foot of low water mark. The new
caisson to be sunk around this was also square, the inner wall nearest the
pier being forty-six feet on a side and the outer wall being seventy feet on a
rapidly forward, the caisson sinking gradually as the courses were placed on
top, till finally the bottom of the river was reached. The bottom, however,

side, leaving seven feet between the old caisson and the new, and twelve
feet between the outer and inner walls of the new caisson. Six feet above the
bottom or cutting edge of the new caisson was a roof built in from wall to
wall, the space underneath being the air or working chamber, and the
space above for sand filling to give the weight necessary for sinking. South-
ern pine sticks I2"xi2", dressed on four sides, were used in building. The
pine was from the Arkansas forests and was a fine lot of timber. Whole car-
loads would be unloaded of pieces twenty and twenty-six feet long with
hardly a knot in them. As nc objection was made to sap, there was some sap
in the pieces used. The timbers in each course were dapped together, and the
the courses were drift bolted together. Drift bolts were seven-eights ins.
in diameter by two feet ten inches long, and were driven into holes bored
one-sixteenth of an inch less than their own diameter. In this way each
course was securely fastened to two courses below. Drifts were spaced
about three feet apart. Seven courses of the caisson were put together on
the pile support before it was lowered into the water. This included the
cutting edge and the sides -and roof of the working chamber. The sides
of the chamber were three and one-half feet thick, and the roof two and
one-half feet thick. All spaces between timbers in the chamber and on the
outside of the walls were carefully calked with oakum.
The lowering of the caisson into water was accomplished as follows:
Imagine the caisson resting on the floor beams of a bridge and instead of the
usual hangers at the ends, screws three inches in diameter are used. These
screws run up through a I2"xl2" cap on the piles, and nuts are screwed on
from the upper end down against this cap, or rather against a washer on the
cap. By turning these nuts the floor beams could be raised or lowered, and
with it the caisson. Wrenches with handles five feet long were used to turn
these nuts, and three men operated each wrench. Twenty-four of these
lowering screws three inches in diameter by twenty-two and one-half feet
long were used, and about eighty men were needed to operate them. All
the nuts were moved simultaneously, the "course around" shouted by the
foreman being the signal for every man to move his wrench a quarter turn.
The lowering was done at the rate of about one foot per hour.
A calculation of the weight of a cubic foot of timber was made from the
displacement in the water. It was forty-five pounds. This was for unseas-
oned pine cut about one month.
It was a great relief to get the caisson floated. The building now went


was very uneven at this place. The current was swift and the presence
of the bridge pier had caused the bottom to be scoured out in some places
and the sand heaped up in others. So while one part of the cutting edge
of the caisson rested on sand, under other parts the sand had been washed
out four or five feet lower. The problem now was to get an even bearing
for the cutting edge before the caisson could be weighted down and the air
turned on. The only feasible plan that presented itself was to fill up these
low places with sacks of sand. Sand could be obtained near by on
the bank of the river. The sacks used were of burlap, and as much sand
was put in each as one man could conveniently carry. This was about one
and eight-tenths cubic feet. These were carried on the flatboat or barge
to the caisson, where they were slid or dropped into the water with as little
disturbance as possible. The low places did not fill up very rapidly, the
current carrying many of the sacks a distance down stream before they
struck bottom. About twelve thousand sacks were put in before a large
enough proportion of the cutting edge had a support. Thirty or forty feet
out of a total of four hundred and sixty feet of this cutting edge was still
unsupported. On account of the large size of the caisson, and the impossi-
bility of binding it into a firm, solid structure, great care had to be exer-
cised to keep it from springing or getting in "wind." By observing the
amount of water that each corner was drawing, one could easily see whether
it was in wind or not.;
The open space afiove the roof of the working chamber was now filled
in with sand to a depth of about four feet, which was the amount of sand
necessary to hold the cutting edge on the bottom when the air was turned
into the chamber. It would not do to overload it at this time as the sup-
port was not uniform' enough to keep it from being twisted and sprung.
The cutting edge was thirty-five feet below the surface of the water, which
means that 35 X -43 = IS pounds of air per square inch are needed to force
all the water out of the working chamber (.43 being the weight in pounds
of a column of water one foot high and having one square indi cross-sec-
tion). The air, which was supplied by two compressors twelve hundred
feet away on the shore, and was brought out through a 4-inch pipe, was now
turned into the chamber and the water driven out. Men immediately went
in through the lock, and with moist clay stopped up all the small leaks.
There was no difficulty in finding these leaks as the escaping air made a
noise that showed where such openings existed.


THE' TECHNIC.
there were other parts of the cutting edge that had nearly five feet to go
before reaching it.
At this point let us take a trip into the caisson. It is now down in the
rock part of the way around. We first prepare for the trip by putting on
some old clothes, as the mud is over everything down in,the ''hole.'' Also
some high-topped rubber boots. We also leave our watches behind as the
compressed air usually does some mischief by making them run faster or
slower, or stopping them entirely. Tied to the part of the caisson that is
above water is a house boat called the "Sand Hog" boat after the Sand
Hogs, who are the men who work at excavating under compressed air.
This house has two compartments, one for the white men and one for the
black. There is a stove in each kept red hot most of the time to dry the
clothes of the men who are off duty.
After inspecting these quarters, which are kept as clean as one man
can keep them, we go out and onto the caisson. A large round cylinder
is in front of us, rising up through the sand filling. It is about four feet
in diameter and reaches fourteen feet above water. This is the lock.
About ten feet down from the top it reduces in size to fit the 3-foot shaft
that reaches to the chamber below. If any one has a cold or his heart is
weak he had better not go down. The outside lock tender gives five raps
on the lock. It is answered by five raps from the inside lock tender, who
proceeds to let the air out of the lock before the door can be opened by
which we go in. This door is in the top of the lock four or five feet above
our heads. As it opens a dense white fog comes out, and then up through the
fog comes the head of the man inside. We climb up a ladder and down
through a small door two feet in diameter and are inside the lock. An
incandescent electric lamp lights the place. There is a peculiar odor, rather
disagreeable, that comes up from the region beneath. It is a small place.
Standing on one side you can stretch out your hand and touch each person
in there.
The outside lock tender now pulls the door up with a block and tackle.
Air is now let in from the shaft beneath. It has the sound of escaping
steam. Almost immediately some one cries out. The air valve is quickly
closed. The pressure of the air on the drums of his ear caused a sharp
pain. He is told to work his jaws up and down or to hold his nose, closo
his mouth and force the air from his lungs into his mouth, or to do the act
of swallowing. This is to open the passage from the mouth to the ear so


that the. pressure will be equalized on the ear drums. After one or two
attempts the pain in his ear stops, and some more air is let into the lock.
Again there are cries from those whose ears are not kept open enough to
let the air in. Again they get relief and the air keeps coming hi. After
two or three minutes the pressure has increased to twenty pounds per
square inch above the atmosphere outside, and as this is the pressure in the
shaft below and in the chamber we are "through."
A small round door now opens at our feet and as we look down, we
see two or three lights that illuminate the shaft. We go down through this
opening and on down the shaft by a ladder fixed to one side. The air feels'
very damp and the ladder wet, dirty and long. We go down about 40 feet
when we pass through another door into the working chamber. There is a
steady roaring that first attracts attention. It is the repeated echosofall the
noises that occur from small streams of escaping air and from the drilling
and shoveling of the workmen. We are in a narrow low passage-way that
leads both ways from the shaft. We hear the steady blows of the hammer
as the men drill holes into the rock to hold a charge of dynamite. We
notice that we have to exert ourselves considerably when we speak in order
to be heard, not entirely on account of the roaring, but because with an
ordinary effort one would make no noise at all. Ask one of the party to
whistle. He puckers up his lips, starts the air from his lungs as he is used
to do and no sound comes out at all. He tries again harder than before and
still no sound. Again he tries with all his might and out comes a faint
weak whistle.
We start along the chamber, now climbing over a pile of loose sand,
now wading in water where the excacation has been done below the air
pressure line, then climbing over a cross beam that braces the sides of the
chamber. Finally we come to a partition or bulkhead with a hole in it large
enough to crawl through. Every twenty or thirty feet along the chamber
is an incandescent electric lamp that shows us where we are and the way to
go. At 35 feet from the shaft we came down we turn an angle of 90 degrees
and pass through two of the bulkheads just mentioned. Here the workmen
come in sight. They are drilling holes or piling up the loose rock where
it can be gotten at readily for hoisting out, a process that will be described
later. We want to see the whole chamber, so the men stop their work a
moment while we climb past them. Part of the way we can walk erect and
at other times have to crawl on our hands and knees.


THE TECHNIC.
Sixty feet from the first turn is another turn at right angles. We have
to go through some bulkheads to get by the corner. These bulkheads are
to give strength and stiffness to the caisson, the corners being points hard-
est to make strong. Just after turning the corner out of sight of the work-
men a dull thud is heard. It is the explosion of about a pound of dyna-
mite within fifty feet of us. The noise is very much deadened.
A little farther on we come to some men drilling holes into a large
"nigger-head" stone of about one cubic yard volume. It is a loose stone,
very hard, and will have to be blasted into small fragments before it can
be gotten out. The drills used are ordinary chisel drills held by one man
who gives it a slight turn after each blow given by another man.
We go on around till we come to the shaft through which we came
down. We have made the circuit around the pier a distance of 250 feet.
The climb up the ladder is more difficult than the climb down, and if one
is not very strong one is likely to have a feeling of exhaustion at this time
which would not be produced in open air with twice the amount of exer-
tion. One lives faster, the heart heats are increased, and a very noticeable
amount of exhilaration is felt.
We go up the ladder and into the lock, the door beneath is pulled up,
the outside lock tender is warned that someone is coming out, giving five
raps for an answer. The air is equalized in the lock faster than it was
when we came in. We feel the air coming out of our inner ears, and at the
same time the temperature in the lock goes down rapidly. A dense fog is
formed. As soon as the air pressure is the same as that outside the door
in the top is let down by the man outside and we climb out. The trip has
certainly been worth the trouble. Although the pressure is not half what
is sometimes used, it is enough for the first time.
The work of excavation in the chamber was carried on night and day,
the men working in three shifts of eight hours each. One of the shifts was
composed entirely of negroes. Their work in this line was very nearly as
good as that of the white men. They could not be depended on in an emer-
gency, however. They lacked nerve.
The pressure was not great enough to cause much of caisson disease
or "bends." There were only two or three cases, and they were not serious.
One negro who was getting over an attack, when asked if it hurt more than
rheumatism, said: "Oh yes! Wusser, much wusser."
The rock and coarse materials in the chamber were hoisted out in buck-
ets through supply shafts. These shafts were three in number, placed on


65
different sides of the caisson. They were 3 feet in diameter. The lock
used is known as the Moran lock. It is built for rapid handling of material,
has large openings for equalizing the air, and doors that are operated by
levers on the outside. The materials were raised or lowered in a bucket
holding about twenty cubic feet. A derrick and hoisting engine on a barge
raised and lowered the bucket. The cable was woven smooth so that by
using packing where it runs through the door of the lock it works air tight.
When the material was close by the bottom of the shaft a bucket full could
be taken out every five minutes.
Sometimes a method called "blowing" was resorted to to hasten the
sinking of the caisson. This was to let the air out of the chamber rapidly,
faster than the water would come in, till the pressure was reduced ten or
fifteen pounds per square inch. This could be done when the cutting edge
was down in sand or reck all the way around so the water would be held
back to a considerable extent, the result being as if a load of ten or fifteen
pounds per square inch had been suddenly added to the caisson. This
method had to be resorted to with considerable caution as there was danger
of opening up seams and joints to such a degree that the chamber would
not hold air and the water could not be driven out again.
When the caisson was finally down into rock all around, the loose
material was all carefully cleaned out and the "sealing up" process com-
menced. That is, to fill the chamber with concrete. The concrete was
mixed outside the caisson and taken in through the Moran lock. After
filling every part of the chamber the air was kept on for a couple of days
to allow the concrete to set.
The next thing done was to fill in the space between the new caisson
and the old with concrete. This was done to a distance of about 30 feet
above the cutting edge. A solid ring of concrete now surrounded the old
caisson, tightly bound in by the new caisson.
The conclusions that were reached in regard to the leaning of the pier
were that the old caisson was not on rock all around, some parts being on
sand, possibly as much as two or three feet deep. Observations taken on
the pier with a level showed the greatest movement to take place after high
water in the river. The further conclusion was reached that this sand was
being washed out gradually and the caisson would continue to lean till it
came to a firm bearing. The new caisson with the concrete ring would put
an effectual stop to any further washing out of this sand.

THE TECHNIC.
THE DRAFTING ROOM OF A BRIDGE OFFICE-
K. C. MANNING, 'go.
After completing the course of studies in engineering, there is really
only one thing lacking to start the young engineer toward success. That
one thing is opportunity. Many a successful engineer can trace his success
to the right opening that gave him a chance to start. The young engineer
is heing sought after more each year, and the opportunities to get started
are on the increase.
A large number of these opportunities present themselves each year
in the drafting rooms of bridge and structural steel works. When a young
engineer secures one of these positions, he must show a disposition to learn,
work hard, and be willing to do anything. Willingness to take hold of
anything will be a large factor to rapid advancement. Too much stress
cannot be laid upon the theoretical side of the engineering course. Well
grounded theory is the foundation to practical success.
The design and building of a steel structure may be compared to that
of a frame building in which all the nails would be located and holes made
for them before putting the boards together, all the pieces of lumber would
be laid out and sawed to fit before being put in place, the difference being
that if the parts of the steel work do not fit when put together, it is not as
easy to recut and shape them as it is with the lumber. If the pieces of steel
do not fit when put together, they are often spoiled and must be thrown
away. It is often difficult to get the pieces of material to replace the
rejected parts. The material for a bridge is ordered from the rolling mills
to shape, size and length required, assuming that nothing will be spoiled,
just the same as lumber for a house is ordered from the lumber yards. The
rolling mills are often hundreds of miles from the bridge shops, while lum-
ber yards are usually in the community in which the house is being built.
The comparison above will serve to illustrate the truth that one of the
most important requirements of the drafting room is accuracy. The most
careful and painstaking man will make mistakes, but the more nearly a per-
son's work is free from mistakes, the more it will be appreciated. Accuracy
should always have the preference over rapidity. Rapidity, or hurried
work, is almost always accompanied by a larger number of mistakes, or a
slackness of the work in one place or another. Work rushed through an


office without proper care and attention is almost always accompanied by a
greater loss of time in correcting mistakes in drawings while passing
through the shop than is saved in the first place, besides the expense of
correcting errors that may not be found till the work is erected. The draw-
ings and work of this kind are unsatisfactory and should be avoided as far
as possible.
The engineering force of a bridge company is usually divided into two
departments: the estimating, and the detailing.
The work of the estimating department is to prepare the estimates of
weight and cost of all work that the company bids upon, prepare all stress
sheets and preliminary plans when required, and they must secure all data
and information necessary in preparing the detail plans. Sometimes the
plans for making estimates are furnished by the parties wanting the work.
Then it is only necessary to figure the weight and estimate the cost. If no
plans are furnished, the stress sheets and preliminary plans must be worked
up from the data furnished. When plans are furnished, they are usually
prepared by an engineer in the employ of the party wanting the work, or
by a consulting engineer who has charge of the work. The work is con-
tracted for in one of two ways: so much per pound of shipping weight, or
so much for the work complete. The one is called a pound price, and the
other a lump sum; sometimes erected complete ready for traffic, and some-
times f. o. b. (free on board) cars at a certain place, the party buying the
material doing his own erecting.
The work of the detailing department, or what we shall hereafter desig-
nate as the drafting department, is to take the data furnished by the esti-
mating department and make the detail or shop plans. The work usually
requires from three to five times the number of men as the estimating. It
seldom occurs that a set of drawings comes into the office that can be sent
into the shop without being made over, even though they are carefully
worked out in detail; or that a set of plans made for one bridge can be used
again even though it should be of the same length and width. Especially
is this true of railroad work, since the conditions vary so from year to year.
Specifications for material and loading are changing constantly. Ten years
ago a 100-ton engine was considered a heavy engine; today, 150-ton engines
are common in specifications. Cases where plans were used again in this
way have happened only a few times in the ten years' experience of the
writer.


THE TECHNIC.
A shop that turns out 6,000 to 8,000 tons of work per year requires a
drafting force of about eight, distributed about as follows: the chief drafts-
man; two men of experience who' can handh; any kind of work, one or both
being classed as checkers; three man to detail the bulk of the work and
sometimes doing their'own tracing; two men to do tracing and who will
work into detailing. This makes a drafting force of eight, scaling up in
experience. Three years' experience in the drafting room should make
an engineer familiar with the ordinary work that comes up.
We will now take a bridge from the beginning and trace it through the
different steps until it is finished and turned over as completed to the parties
buying it. We will assume that a railroad company desires to contract for a
bridge. The chief engineer will write to the several bridge companies from
which he desires to receive bids, giving the length of span, location, speci-
fications for loading and material, and any other conditions that may gov-
ern this particular bridge, and the date of receiving bids. The estimating
department takes the data given, prepares the stress sheet, figures the weight
of the bridge, and makes an estimate of cost. The bids are received by
the railroad company, and we will suppose that the bridge company we are
considering receives the award of the contract. It is usually presumed that
the lowest bidder gets the contract, although the time of delivery and other
conditions may alter this. In the letting of public work where the plans
and specifications are definite, the lowest responsible bidder gets the con-
tract.
After the contract is secured, all the data required to get out the details
of the work are turned over to the chief of the drafting room. This data
will include the stress sheet, specifications, and a data sheet, properly filled
out, containing a list of items that usually come up in working out the
details. An order, for material must first be made, and this may require
sketches of such details as are not determined by the data furnished, as
every piece of material ordered must have a place in the bridge and every
piece required must be ordered.
This material is usually inspected at the rolling mills by someone
employed by the railroad company, and must meet the requirements of the
specifications. This order for material is turned over to the person whose
business it is to place the orders with the rolling mills and furnish the
inspector with a copy of the same. It is a good plan to check the weight
of the material ordered with the estimated weight of the bridge.


69
After the material is ordered, the work may be laid aside until a con-
venient time comes to work up the details, unless the necessities of the case
require immediate attention. The data is then all turned over to one or
more men, as the case may require, to make the detail drawings. The chief
draftsman should go over the data with the draftsmen, making such explana-
tion that is necessary and outline the manner in which the drawings are. to
be made. Time is saved by planning each sheet and each set of drawings
before beginning the penciling. The drawings are then penciled and traced.
On an average from two to three days are required to pencil one drawing
and less time is required to trace a drawing than to pencil it. If drawings
are to be sent for approval, they are usually sent as soon as the tracings
are finished and looked over, but before checking, in order to save time.
This assumes that the general details, sizes and dimensions are correct,
and that errors which effect the shop work alone do not concern the parties
getting the bridge, and that these errors will be corrected in checking.
The tracings, and all information, are now given to the checker, who
is supposed to check every figure on the drawings and indicate what may
be lacking on the drawings to make them complete and conform to the
requirements of the specification. It is a good plan to put a dot of red
ink under each figure as it is checked, using water proof ink so it will not
run if the tracings get damp, as they generally do when filed in a vault.
All corrections should be made with a blue pencil so as to be seen easily.
The tracings are then returned to the man who detailed the pencil draw-
ings to be corrected. All corrections should be checked by the detailer to
be sure that the corrections are correct. After corrections are all made,
the drawings, with the blue pencil marks still on them, are given back to
the checker who looks the drawings over to see that all corrections have
been properly made.
One of the duties of the drafting room is to make out a shipping bill
by which the material is shipped when the work is finished in the shop.
Every piece of finished material of the different kinds has a line in the
shipping bill, that it may be checked off and the weight placed opposite as
it is shipped.
From twelve to fifteen sets of blue-prints are made of each set of draw-
ings, distributed about as follows: six to the shop, one to the inspector, two
for approval, three for file to the parties buying the bridge, and others as
occasion may require.


The first work in the shop is to make the templates. Almost every
different piece Of material is first laid out on hoards, the holes bored in
their proper places, each piece marked, giving the number required, and
any other necessary information. These pieces of boards are called tem-
plates, and are used for laying out the work on the pieces of steel by clamp-
ing or holding the templates on the pieces of steel. There are from one to
eight pieces of each kind for one span of a bridge and the templates are
used on each piece, making one template serve to lay out as many pieces as
there are of that kind. One template often serves for more than one kind,
where they differ only slightly, by properly marking the templates. Where
rivet spacing is symmetrical about a center line, only one half of the length
of the piece need be laid out on the template. Some of the large plates
are often laid out on one of the plates itself, punched and then used as a
template, as it would be too expensive to provide the lumber on which to
lay it out.
The work then goes through the process of shearing, punching or drill- .
ing, assembling, reaming if required, riveting, milling, boring, inspection,
painting shipping, and erection. A draftsman should visit the shop fre-
quently to see how the work is done and acquaint himself as much as pos-
sible with the practical side of the work.
All the work of the drafting room should be checked by some one other
than the person who made the original. This cannot always be done but
should be carried out as far as possible. The work of this department is
final and is so important that every precaution possible should be taken to
eliminate the errors. It usually results in a saving of time to have the work
thoroughly checked as all mistakes will be discovered before the work has
passed through the shop and is erected, and it takes a great deal more time
to look up mistakes and correct them after the work is laid aside than it
does to do it in the regular way while the work is fresh in the mind. When
it is remembered that there are hundreds of figures and relations of parts
on every drawing, and that they pass through the steps of preliminary com-
putations, transferring to the pencil drawing, and tracing, with so many
chances of misconception, it is very important to have the final work thor-
oughly checked.
The tools necessary for a draftsman in a bridge office to have are two
45° triangles. 4-in. and 10-in.; two 30° and 6o° triangles, 5-in. and 13-in.;
two good right line pens; one good 42-in. T square, one that is stiff and


not too light; one compass complete; one bow pen; one bow pencil; one
engineer's and one architect's scale; pencil and ink erasers; scratcher; and
piece of soap-stone to rub over a place in the tracing cloth that has been
scratched, to renew the surface and prevent the ink from running. Trans-
parent triangles and scales with celluloid faces are best.
A few of the practical wrinkles of the drafting room will be found in
the following:
All blue and black pencil marks are removed from the tracing with
benzine. Dampen a cloth with it and apply to the tracing. Lay the tracing
on a newspaper, or some paper that is not wanted, before applying the
benzine, as it passes through the tracing and will spoil a pencil drawing.
Plenty of linen cloth is usually obtainable about the drafting room by wash-
ing out the tracing cloth.
An ink to make white lines on blue-prints is obtained by dissolving
soda, lime or saleratus in water, or an ink can be obtained of dealers in
draftsmen's supplies. Any of these inks will run and blot the lines if the
print becomes damp.
It is the practice in some offices to pencil the work on the tracing cloth
and ink it in. In others, the penciling is done on paper and traced. The
writer prefers the latter.
Tracing should be done on the rough side of the cloth as it is easier
to mark on that side in making corrections, changes or additions. Tracing
cloth has a tendency to roll up toward the glazed side, and when the border
is put on the drawing on the rough side it will correct this tendency to roll;
whereas, if it is put on the glazed side, it will tend to increase it.
There should be one size of sheet for detail work, and under no cir-
cumstances should this vary as it is unnecessary and always proves a nui-
sance. Where the drawing "cannot be made on one sheet, it can be made
on two or more, and so arranged that the sheets may be pasted together
after printing. 23 x 35 inches for border lines, and 24 x 36 inches over all
is a convenient side.
Prepared ink is preferable to the stick ink which must be ground, as
it is more uniform, cheaper and cleaner.
Tracing cloth powder, which can be obtained of the dealer in small
cans ready for use, is better and causes less trouble than powdered chalk.
The natural place for the title of a shop drawing is the lower right
hand corner, the top of the title being about three and one-half inches above


THE TECHNIC.
the border line. If a stamp is used for all of the title except that which
describes the work on the sheet, the titles will be more uniform and will
add considerable to the appearance of the drawings. The title should be
made plain and prominent for ready reference in the files. It should con-
tain the contract number, sheet number, general title of the work, the special
work on that sheet, scale, date, name of detailer, tracer and checker, and
name of bridge company. In the lower right hand corner a circle three-
quarters of an inch in diameter with a horizontal line through the center,
having the number of the sheet above the line and the total number of
sheets in the set below the line, makes a convenient means of reference.
This sample of title will serve to illustrate.

The writer prefers to file the tracing flat in a drawer, one drawer con-
taining as many tracings as is convenient.
The best way to stretch tracing cloth on a drawing board is by means
of small one-half ounce tacks. The tacks are driven into and removed
from the board by means of a special hammer made of j4-,nch round steel
and tempered. One end is turned over at right angles to the length so that
the end is of an inch from the inner face, and the other end is straight
and sharpened like a chisel. One end is used for driving and the other for
removing the tacks. The whole is about t)J-J inches long. This hammer is


73
magnetized at a dynamo and will pick up the tacks so they do not need to
be handled with the fingers. Place the tracing cloth on the board and empty
a box of tacks on the tracing and tack the center of the four sides with
two tacks each, stretching the tracing tight. Then stretch the tracing by
working from the center of the sides to the corners, placing a tack every
two or three inches. The tacks that are left loose on the tracing are taken
up with the hammer and dropped back into the box. This gives a per-
fectly smooth surface to work upon and the tacks do not interfere with the
sliding of the T square. The tacks are removed with the chisel end of the
hammer, taking up one tack after another, the tacks all clinging to the ham-
mer and then dumped into the box. The tracing is put down and taken
up very quickly this way, and a thumb tack has not been used in this office
for sever, years.
There should be a uniform style of lettering for all shop drawings, one
that is plain and easy to read. The Reinhardt slant letter is a very good
one for this purpose.
Full, light, black lines are used for dimension lines. There is enough
contrast between the light dimension lines and the heavy lines representing
the object drawn not to confuse the drawing. The full black lines are put
on the drawing more rapidly than either dotted or red ink lines.
EDITORIALS.
We would respectfully request our readers to pay special attention to
our advertising pages. The firms represented in this issue are of the high-
est standing and it is to their patronage that the success of The Technic
is largely due.
We wish to thank our contributors for their assistance in making The
Technic and the interest they manifest for its welfare. We are pleased to
say that the writer of one of the papers, Mr. Frank M. Dunlap, was one of
the founders of the Engineering Society.
The Engineering Society has enjoyed a prosperous year. There seems
to have been a greatly increased interest in the Society, and it has been able
to pay off a considerable debt left from last year. The annual banquet this
spring was a decided success, both financially and socially. A large num-
ber were present, and an all round, general good time was enjoyed.


We wish to impress upon the graduate members of the Society the great
convenience they may confer by advising The Technic of any change of
address. It is almost impossible to keep the mailing list correct from year
to year. The Technic is mailed to all to whom they are due, but of course
are not received if the member has changed his address. We are often in
receipt of letters asking why The Technic has not been received, although
through no fault of ours. If any one who has changed his address will
notify the managing editor of the Technic Board, it will not only be a great
aid to the board, but will insure the prompt receipt of the Technic.
It is gratifying to know that the Mechanical Latoratory is to be con-
siderably enlarged the coming summer, and among the apparatus which is
to be placed in it is a compound marine engine, now being designed by
some of the students, to be used in some of the courses in the recently
established department of marine engineering. The offer to become junior
professor of naval architecture has been accepted by Mr. H. C. Sadler, of
Glasgow, Scotland.
