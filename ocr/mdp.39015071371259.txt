CIVIL ENGINEERS IN THE U. S. NAVY.
E. I'. GOODRICH, '98.*
What need has our Navy of civil engineers?
At first the question puzzles most persons, hut when one becomes
acquainted with the organization of that department of our Government
having to do with the sea, the answer is apparent.
The Secretary of the Navy is one of the close advisers of the chief
executive of this nation, and represents before him and before Congress
that branch of the federal organization called the Navy Department.
As everyone knows that department has charge of the building and
repair of war vessels. Naturally, it also oversees the equipping of those
vessels with engines and boilers, with mechanical signals and flags, with
guns and ammunition, and with men to run them. It must care for the
physical welfare of these men in time of war and in time of peace. To
♦Civil Engineer, U. S. Navy.

carry on and properly supervise these various phases of its work, the Navy
Department has established Bureaus. Thus, there are the Bureaus of Con-
struction and Repair, Equipment, of Steam Engineering, of Navigation, of
Medicine and Surgery, and of Supplies and Accounts, each intrusted with
the class of work which its name implies. Many of the tilings coming
under cognizance of each of these Bureaus are readily distinguished in a
real or imaginary visit aboard any of the vessels belonging to our navy
as they sail the high seas. But a day comes when each vessel must stop
to replenish her supply of coal, of ammunition, of food, perhaps of men,
and even the most perfectly made must often undergo repairs to her
machinery, her equipment, or her gigantic, complex self. Her sides must
be scraped and painted or perhaps repaired, her armament increased, or
her armour thickened, and her frame strengthened to carry the added load.
In order to accomplish, to the best advantage, these and many other
ends, the Government lias established navy yards and naval stations upon
the sea coasts of this country and her different possessions. There are at
present along the sea board of the United States fourteen such yards and
stations, and Cuba, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Guam, the Samoan Islands, and
the Philippines each have a naval rendezvous. Those on the home shores
are at Portsmouth, N. H.. Boston, New London, Conn., New York, Phila-
delphia, Washington. Norfolk, Port Royal, S. C, Key West. Dry Tor-
tugas, Fla. ,Pensacola, Fla., Algiers, La., San Francisco and Pugct Sound.
Some of these places are especially equipped as coaling stations, such as
the ones at New London.t Key West, Dry Tortugas, and the one on the
Samoan Islands. Others have extensive docking facilities, such as the
New York Yard with its three miles of water front lined with concrete or
stone quay walls and its, several dry docks, two now in use, one being
reconstructed, and one under consideration with money appropriated by-
Congress for its construction.
Some yards are equipped principally with shops for repairs or con-
struction work. The immense Government gun shops are located at the
Washington Yard, and the New York Yard is so fully equipped that sev-
eral men-of-war have been constructed upon the ways there. The Maine
was launched from them not many months before her fatal trip to Cuba.
i"For a description of this plant see Eng. News, Vol. XLIIL, No. 3,
p. ,}8, Jan 18, 1900.


Some yards serve as great reservoirs of supply. Almost daily ship-
ments are made from the acres of floor space in the storehouses at the New
York Yard to some di-tant point,—the Philippines, Guam, Hawaii or
Puerto Rico: and there are located the factories where are made the gar-
ments for all the sailors of our navy, the factory from whence comes the
flags for all the ships, the factory where the green coffee is roasted and
packed for shipment to all our hoats, the shops where is made much of
the metal furniture u~ed aboard our battleships, and many other important
navy necessities.
Some yards have extensive barracks for enlisted men. the one at Ports-
mouth having been equipped within a few days with accommodations for
1.600 Spaniards, prisoners from the battle of July 3, 1898.
After every cruise each war vessel has to be taken to some navy yard
where she may be "docked" for thorough overhauling in order to maintain
the wonderful efficiency which lias won world-wide respect and admiration,
and to save our Government millions of dollars which would be necessary
to replace the rapidly wearing out vessels should this constant care be
relaxed. As a vessel approaches her destined port and conies within the
jurisdiction of one of these stations, her officers must be sure that no shoals
exist upon which she may ground. Wharves and sea walls must exist,
beside which she may tie up to unload her excess of stores, and from which
she may again be replenished. Buildings must be available to contain
these stores, and railroads and streets must exist along which to approach
them. Devices must be "at band for removing and loading coal and ammu-
nition. Heavy cranes must be provided to take the vessel to pieces if nec-
essary, and shops be near where repairs can be quickly made. Dry docks
must be there into which the vessel can go and be made dry and approach-
able on all sides. Then, too, the shops must be heated, lighted and pro-
vided with power. They must be kept in perfect repair, and new ones
must often be designed and constructed. The streets must be lighted,
paved and drained; the sea walls and docks and railroads must be repaired
when damaged, and must constantly be extended by new construction.
To care for all this multifarious work, connected with the various navy
yards, there exists under the Navy Department, one bureau called the
Bureau of Yards and Docks. In the body of regulations drawn up for
the regulation of the navy is stated that "the duties of the Bureau of Yards
and Docks shall comprise all that relates to the construction and main-


tenance of all docks (including dry docks), slips, wharves, piers, quay
walls and buildings of all kinds, for whatever purpose needed, within the
limits of navy yards, and naval stations * * * . It shall prepare the
plans and make the estimates for the above structures.
(2) It shall repair and require for furniture for all buildings in navy
yards.
(3) It shall be charged * * * with the purchase, sale and trans-
fer of all land and buildings connected with navy yards, and shall also be
charged with the care and preservation of all monuments of title to lands
acquired for naval use.
(4) It slhall provide light and water for all buildings, or for what-
ever purposes they may be needed in navy yards; and shall require for all
fuel, except that which is used by other bureaus.
(5) It shall have charge of all landings, derricks, shears, cranes.
sewers, dredging, railway tracks, cars, wheels, trucks, grading, paving,
walks, shade trees, enclosure walls and fences, ditching, reservoirs, cisterns,
fire engines and apparatus * * * .
(8) It shall determine upon and require for all the tools, stores, mate-
rials, means and appliances of every kind required for its own purposes, and
erect, and repair the same.
(9) It shall superintend all work done under it * * * .
(11) It shall estimate for, and defray from its own funds, the cost
necessary to carry out its duties as almve defined * * * .
(13) It shall have charge of the installation and maintenance of tele-
phones within the limits of navy yards or stations."
It is immediately evident from this that the Government requires the
services of men educated in that most conglomerate of all professions—
Civil Engineering. The first civil engineer to do any extended work for
the Navy Department was Laomi Baldwin, who, with several others, was
employed in 1S28 to consider the construction of the first dry docks. There-
after, whenever thought necessary, the services of professional civil engi-
neers were secured to carry on the various engineering enterprises required
by the constantly increasing navy. On July 5, 1862, an act was passed by
Congress whereby a civil engineer was to be constantly with the Bureau
of Yards and Docks at the Navy Department in Washington, D. C. In
1867 Congress granted a civil engineer to each navy yard and station as
was necessary to their welfare. At the beginning of 1872 eight such engi-


neers were employed, and in that year two more were appointed, the two
now standing at the head of the list of civil engineers in the navy—Rear
Admiral Mordeeai T. Endicott, now Chief of the Bureau of Yards and
Docks, and Captain Peter C. Asserson, now in charge of the work at the
New York Navy Yard.
Up to 1871 the civil engineers were merely civil employees carried on
the civil li-ts in the offices of the paymasters of the navy. In 1871 Con-
gress passed an act providing relative rank for those holding civil engi-
neering positions, but the President did not confer such rank until Feb-
ruary 24. 1881. There are at present twenty-one members in the corps,
the number having been limited by law in 1899.
Whenever vacancies occur through death, resignation, retirement or
additions authorized by Congress, examinations are held of all those pre-
senting themselves. Young men are eligible who arc between the ages of
twenty-five and thirty-five, who have graduated from a reputable engineer-
ing school, and who have had three years practical experience. The exami-
nations of late years have been rather tedious and exacting, covering gen-
eral physique, education and experience. The educational test covers Eng-
lish grammar, composition .arithmetic, algebra, geometry, analytical geom-
etry, trigonometry, calculus, both differential and integral, theoretical me-
chanics, hydraulics, geology, mineralogy, engineering materials, drawing,
topographical and mathematical, specifications, civil engineering, strains in
structures, retaining walls, dry docks, marine railways, sea walls, floating
docks, machine shops, power plants, water works, sewers, railroads, pave-
ments, chimneys, wharves, qua^ys, bridges, electrical apparatus and methods,
steam engines and water wheels, pumps, etc.
Any branch of engineering is delightful to one enthusiastic about his
profession, but should so many of its different phases present themselves
to an engineer in rapid succession, he cannot but be happy over his pro-
fessional lot. And this is the lot of a Navy Cjvil Engineer.


PARTIALLY BRACED FRAMES:-PORTAL BRACING.
PROF. CHAS. E. GREENE.
The analysis of a trestle bent when the bracing extends only a portion
of the distance from the top to the foundation is less simple than the dis-
cussion of ordinary frames, because bending moments are caused in the
posts when a horizontal force, such as wind pressure or centrifugal force, is
applied in the plane of the bent at or above its top. The same action takes
place in the end or intermediate posts of a bridge, since the portal or other
bracing occupies only the upper portion of the bridge cross-section.
The first case considered is represented by Figure I. Here the posts
are supposed to be practically hinged at the bottom, so that no moments
exist at A and B; the inclined braces are ties. As the given external
force H, at E, may act from either side, the two posts will be of the same
cross-section, and hence will have the same stiffness to resist horizon-
tal bending towards the positions
w shown by the dotted lines. There-
fore the bending moments and
shears will be alike in the two, and
the horizontal components of the
reaction at A and at B will be
% H. The frame F C D G re-
mains rectangular.
Let H — 12,000 lbs. and the size
of the bent be as marked.
The bending moment M at F
(or G) in the post, since there is no
moment at A, will be x/i H X A F
— €4,000 ft. lbs., which will call for
a force at C to balance it with an
arm C F. 84,000 -4- 6 = 14,000 lbs.
at C. The horizontal force at F
will be equal and opposite to the
sum of those at top and bottom, or
20,000 lbs. This force must be the
thrust of the piece F G.
As the horizontal component of
the tension in C G must supply
this thrust in F G and must also exert an equal force on the post B D at G,
the horizontal component of tension in C G = 40,000 lbs. and the tension
itself = 40,000 X CG-tFG = 40,000 — := 44,700 lbs.
12""
(Note.—In Figure 1 the force at C should be 14.000. not 4,000 The dotted line should
be the same as the one below Ps in Figure 7.—Ed.)


Of the +0,033 lbs. of horizontal tension brought by G C to C, 14,003 lbs.
will be taken up by the post at C, as shown above, as reaction or shear to
bend the post, and 26,000 lbs. will be left to compress C 1). Of this com-
pression, 14,030 lbs. again acts against the post at D, and the remaining
12,000 lbs. balances or is caused by the given external force H.
There remain to be found the stresses in the posts. Take moments
about A or B for the horizontal force H. Compression in A C or tension in
BG = H X E B

add such load as may be carried on the trestle,
is carried by a track centrally placed on C I), the
Compression in A C = 30,000 + 20,000 = 50,000 lbs.
Tension in B G = — 30,000 -J- 2o,coo = — 10,000 lbs.
By moments about C, stress in G D — H X I) E --:- C D= 12,000.j5
= 10,000 lbs. tension. The 20,000 lbs. of load on that post will change
the stress in G D to 10,000 lbs. compression.
The difference between the stresses in B G and G D must be the verti-
cal component of the the tension at G of C G, or 44,700.- = 20,000 ibs.
The bending moments at different
points of C 1) depend upon the points
where the load is placed and upon
the magnitude of H and its arm I) E.
The reduction of D E to zero and the
removal of the vertical load will bring
this case to that of portal or interme-
diate bracing between two bridge
trusses, if the posts are thought to be
hinged at their lower ends. As H
may come from either side, the range
of stress in each post may be seen
from the above results The bending
moment of 84,000 ft. lbs. at F and G
must not be overlooked in designing
the posts.
If the design is like Figure 2, it is evident that either set of diagonals,
C K D or F L G.will brace the upper rectangle. As the force of 12,000 lbs.
at D might, at another time, be applied from the opposite direction at C,
each one of the diagonals must be designed to resist compression as well
as tension, and will be of the same size. Hence it will be a reasonable
assumption that each set offers the same resistance to the distortion of the
rectangle.
Then, by moments about B, as the post A F carries 12,000 X 18 h- 12
= 18,000 lbs. compression, the vertical components in F L and C K will be
q.ooo lbs. each, and the compression in F C becomes 9,000 lbs. As the
diagonals slope at 45° with the horizontal, their horizontal components must

FIG. 3.
also be 9,000 lbs. The tensions and compressions in the diagonals will be
9,000 X 1414 = 12,700 lbs.
As C K supplies 9,000 lbs. horizontal tension at C, and 12,000 lbs. is
needed there, shown by the dotted arrow, to balance the 6,000 lbs. reaction
at A, as explained in the case of Figure 1, C L must supply the remainder,
or 3,000 lbs. tension as marked. At L, as indicated by the arrows below
K, F L brings 9,000 lbs. of horizontal thrust and L G 9,000 lbs. of horizontal
tension; hence, for equilib-
rium, L D must have 15,-
000 lbs. compression. This
compression at D, to which
is added 9,000 lbs. of hor-
izontal component in K I),
is balanced by 24,000 lbs.,
made up of 12,000 lbs. ex-
ternal force, and 12,000 lbs.
reaction or shear which the
post D B requires as it re-
sists the external force.
The same analysis gives
the stresses marked on the
lower horizontal member.
One must not be satified
with the moments and stresses obtained unless they give equilibrium and
thus check at all points.
A similar case will be the em-
ployment of three panels of 45"
bracing, as shown in Figure 3.
Note that the stress in the middle
panel of the lower horizontal mem-
ber is zero; and, as the two diag-
onals in each panel balance in
stress, the top and bottom mem-
bers in each panel give a resultant
stress of + 6,000 lbs., being the
half of H that must be transferred
to the left post.
If two knee braces, F L and L
G are employed, Figure 4, the pro-
portions of the frame being as in-
dicated, the horizontal force at F
and G is 18,000 lbs., which will be
the horizontal component in F L
and L G. The stress in the upper segment of the post becomes zero, and
the stresses in the horizontal member are as marked.
A modification of this frame, shown by the addition of the dotted mem-
ftooo¥,
■Jos.jjC
l±-J&gt;




bers C 1, I K. and K. L&gt;, is used as a bridge portal. Since the compression
in A F and the tension in B G must be 18,000 lbs., and the vertical com-
ponent ot the stress in F I, caused by the necessary horizontal force of
18,000 lbs. to be applied at F, is 18,000 lbs. compression, the stress in F C
must be zero. Therefore C I, and
similarly D K, are without stress, -goooa*
or there would not be equilibrium
in a vertical direction at C and P.
Hence C 1 and D K. as also I K,
only serve to stiffen F L and L G.
If knee-braces are put in the
corners, with a space between
their upper ends, Figure 5, the
forces developed in the frame and
those tending to bend the horizon-
tal member are as indicated. The

C. This pull downward at C and the equal upward thrust at D make a
couple with arm C D, which is seen, by the sketch at C D', to balance the
couple 36,000 X K L, caused by the two knee-braces. The bending action
on C D is considerable.
It is very apparent, from Figure 5, that slender knee-braces will not
suffice to carry a horizontal external force down the frame; and the top
lateral bracing of a bridge must ordinarily transfer most of the wind
pressure to the portals, as the knee-braces are generally too light to do
more than stiffen each panel.
Many trestle frames have the bases of posts firmly bedded or fixed
by anchor bolts, so that bending moments will be resisted at those points.
The posts of Figure 6, if so constructed at A and B, will tend to assume
the dotted reverse curves indicated, under the action of H at D. The tan-
gents at A and B remain vertical, and the frame C D G F in moving to
C' F' remains rectangular, so that the deflections FF' and CC, of the
points F' and C from the vertical tangent at A, must be the same.
The method of expressing proportional deflections by area moments,
developed by the writer in his "Graphics," will enable one to find the
bending moments at A and F with little trouble. The method has many
useful applications to a variety of problems, and is much more tractable
than is mathematical integration.
The bending moment diagram for the post A C, if it was hinged at A
and C and had the force applied at F, that actually comes through G F,
would be the triangle N P R. Let the maximum ordinate P S of this tri-


angle be denoted bv M. The true diagram, when the post is fixed and
restrained at A, is the shaded area, the bending moment at A being ON =
M0, and at F being PQ = M,.
Let N S — a and S R — c. Then the deflection F F' from the tangent
at A is proportional to
Triangle N P S • A a — (Triangle O N Q • i a + Triangle N Q S • * a) =
M ■ la- in — M0 • in ■ ii a — M0——- ■ * a ■ k a.
Deflection C C' is proportional to

If the dimensions of the frame are as marked on the sketch, and H =
12,000 lbs., M0 = 54,857 ft. lbs., and M, = 41,143 ft. lbs. Then the shear or
horizontal force needed at the upper end C of the post is 41,143 -* 8 =
5,144 lbs., and the horizontal force supplied by the strut at F must be 6,000
+ 5,144 = 11,144 lbs. The horizontal component in the diagonal tie will
therefore be twice that amount, or 22,288 lbs., since the post at G must
alsobe acted upon with the same force as at F. The tension in the tie
itself will be 22,288- \\ = 25,070 lbs. The compression in the upper strut
is 22,288 — 5,144 = 17,144 lbs.
The compression in A C is the vertical component of the stress in C G,
or 22,288- I'g = i:,i4l lbs. The tension in B G will be the same in amount.
Any vertical load on C D will be carried by the two posts, as usual. The
correctness of the stress in the posts, and hence of the other quantities, can
be checked by moments about one of the points where the bending moment
is zero; that is, at M0 -:- ± H — 54,857 : 6,000 - q.14 ft. above A or B.
Then 12,000(24 — 9.14) -:- 16 = 11,145 "&gt;s-


A frame may also be braced at three points of attachment to each post,
as shown in Figure 7. This bracing is a combination of Figures 3 and 4.
Let the three successive divisions of the posts, from the base up, be denoted
by a, b and c, and suppose at present that the posts are hinged at their
bases. Each post will tend to bend into the curve shown on the left, under
the given horizontal component of the reaction, JH, and the unknown

components of the stresses in the several parts arc as marked on the frame,
in terms of H, the given external force. To obtain the stresses in the
inclined pieces, multiply by 1,414.
The compression in the left post is H • 6 -+■ 3 = 2 H at the lower end.
The horizontal component in the knee-brace being P, = 3 H, the vertica,
component is also 3 H, which changes the stress in the next division of the-
left post to a tension of H. The upward thrust of the knee-brace at K


must be resisted by C K and K S. R L and K S must have equal stresses
of opposite kinds, as they bear similar relationships to the two sides of the
frame. Further, the stress in R F must be equal and opposite to that in
R L, to assure equilibrium in a vertical direction at R. Hence stress in
F R = stress in K S. Let the vertical component of the stress in KC =
x, and that in K S or F R — y. Then, in going up the post, from F to C,
— r — y + -r = o, or j — x = — i.
At K,y 4- x — 3. . • . x = 2,y = 1.
The vertical component in K S is also one-half of the stress in the
lowest part of the post. The stresses must check in each direction along
the successive parts. Note that the stress in the middle division of the top
strut is again J H, and of the lower strut, zero, as in Figure 3.
If the frame carries a load, its effect can be added. If that load is
applied at R and S, it will probably be transferred to the posts through the
trapezoidal truss F R S G. If H is applied above D, the treatment is
similar.
If a = 3 /', b — c, distance between posts = a, and H = 12,000 lbs., the
forces are,
Pi = 4,500; P2 — 27,000; P3 — 28,500.
C R = — 14,000; R S = + 6,000; S D = + 26,000.

C K = + 18,500 X 1.4; L D = — 18,500 X 1.4.
Other diagonals = 10,000 X 1.4.
Knee-braces ± 28,500 X 1.4. Posts, 20,000 at bottom, 8,500 next, and
18,500 in F C and G D.
If the frame just treated has the posts firmly fixed in direction at their
bases, the moment polygon for each post and the several horizontal forces
applied to the post are represented, in Figure 8, at the left of the frame.
With the same notation as before, let M8 be first assumed as of the same
sign with M, and M0. The bending moment polygon will then be bounded
by the dotted line, and the areas to be used will be more readily seen. The
resulting values for M will have their proper signs.
It is evident that Mj = P, c.
The problem of the moments acting on the post, if the frame is rigid,
is like that of a beam supported at three points in a straight line, and car-
rying no weight, but having one end fastened firmly in a wall at a point
to one side of this line.
Ar,ea moments for spans b and c give, for deflections at P, and P, from
the tangent at P2,

M3 is also equal to M„ — 1 H a. . • . M0 + M, = I H a -f 2 Ms. (2)
As the tangent at A is vertical, the deflections of K and F from that
tangent must be the same. The area moment equation will then be (left

DESIGNING A BOILER FOR SPECIAL CONDITIONS OF
SERVICE.
FKAXK M. Dl'NLAP, '85.
During the summer of 1890, the writer was rilled upon for an opinion
in a case which finally involved the design of a boiler under conditions
which made necessary a departure from the recognized methods of fixing
its proportions hy the horse-power to be developed.
In this article it is proposed to discuss the conditions governing the
choice of the form of engine recommended, and the successive steps in the
design of a boiler suitable for it. It is not intended to give computations
■ in any other than a very general way, or to follow the design down *o
details.
A coal unloader. or machine for handling coal in car-loads from cars
to vessel, at one of the Lake Erie ports had been in successful operation
for several seasons, and was to be rebuilt on substantially the same lines,
but increased in size to be capable of receiving cars of the largest size. The
machine in question was of the type where a loaded car is run from an ele-
vated track into a cylindrical steel frame, where it is secured by clamps, and
the whole is rotated, by rolling the cage up an inclined track till the coal
is poured out of the car into a chute leading to the hold of the vessel, when
it is allowed to return by gravity to its first position where the empty car
is released and pushed out by the entering loaded car.
It will be seen that the demands for power are short, very heavy, and
at quite irregular intervals.
It was assumed, of course, that steam would be the motive power, but
some uncertainly was felt as to the manner of its application. In the old
machine steam was used .in a horizontal, direct, single-acting cylinder, mov-
ing sheaves over which wire cables were reaved and carried around the
periphery of the cylindrical cage so as to roll it on its inclined track.
On account of the large maximum, and comparatively small average,
power demanded, it seemed as if some l&gt;etter mode of application of jiower


ought to be arranged for the new machine, possibly some form of power
•torage which would allow the prime mover to run almost steadily at the
average rate and the power to be given out for use as needed.
It was in discussing the various modes of applying power in regard to
their adaptability that the boiler design here referred to came up for con-
sideration. Besides steam, electricity, compressed air. and hydraulic press-
ure h?d been proposed for the operation of the new machine.
With the design of the structure we have nothing to do. It is a pat-
ented device and the new one is only an enlargement of the old.
A few days spent in watching the old machine in operation showed that,
when handling lump coal, a car every minute and a half was practically
the maximum speed, and that only for short periods. In handling large
coal it is necessary to roll the cage up a second and often a third time to
dislodge what has landed on the braces and to clean out the car thoroughly.
As nearly as could be measured, the distribution of this work \vas six
seconds for rolling up and nine for rolling down and stopping at the bot-
tom, six &gt;econds and nine alternately for the second and third roll, amount-
ing to forty-five seconds, followed by forty-five Seconds or more of rest
while changing cars. This cycle could be repeated indefinitely, except as
the work on the boat or the supply of cars necessitated longer stops.
Whcrw handling ^mall or slack coal, however, about one car per min-
ute was *he maximum speed. The record, so far as heard, was twenty-
nine cars of slack in twenty-seven consecutive minutes. With slack less
care is necessary in handling, and only one roll of the cage, or at most two,
is sufficient for each car.
All estimates for the new machine are based on maintaining the same
speeds with the heavier loads to be handled.
The inclined track of the new machine will rise 7 feet on a base of 22
feet, giving a track 23 feet 1 inch long.
The weight of the cage, as given by its designer, will be closely 75
tons, or 150.000 pounds. The largest coal cars now carry 100,000 pounds
of coal and weigh 36,000 to 40,000 pounds. Allowing 10,000 pounds for
contingencies, considering the car and its load another 150,000 pounds, we
have a total of 300.000 pounds to be rolled up the incline and brought to
rest in six seconds.—one-tenth of a minute.
The center of gravity of the cage is not far from its center of figure,
and the new loc.ooo- pound coal cars are so high that no material error will


be made by considering the center of gravity of the whole to lie in the axis
of rotation.
Now an elementary consideration of the balance of forces and the solu-
tion of a simple proportion give us a force of 90,0.00 (say 01.000) pounds,
applied through the center, parallel to the inclined track, as the force re-
quired to maintain the load in equilibrium.
But it must be moved 23 feet 1 inch from rest back to rest again in
six seconds, and its maximum velocity will be twice the mean, or such as
would carry it 23 feet 1 inch in three seconds.
The force of gravity acting freely on a body for three seconds will pri-
duce a velocity of 96.6 feet per second; and to produce in three seconds, in
a body which is in equilibrium under external forces, a velocity of 7.69 feet
per second, we must add a force in the direction of the desired motion
which is to the weight of the body (or force of gravity) as the desired
velocity1 is to that produced by gravity. This calls for an accelerating force
of 23,882 (say 24.000) pounds added to the 91,000 required to maintain
euqilibrium.
There are additional resistances due to the stiffness of cables, rolling
the load on the track, and friction of a pin rack placed beside the track and
meshing in pin holes in the circumference of the cage.
These resistances, while not by any means negligible, are probably
small in comparison with the other forces involved on account of the slow-
ness of motion and size of the rolling cable. They are, moreover, so diffi-
cult to separate and estimate that any attempt to compute them would be
of very doubtful value. As a good, fair, lump-sum allowance is to be pre-
ferred to an uncertain computation, which might give a false sense of se-
curity, we will allow for them and any other small resistances by adding
10,000 pounds to the combined supporting and accelerating forces, making
125,000 pounds in all, with the probability that the error, if any, is on the
excess side. This force is to be applied through wire cables anchored in
the framework, passing under and around the cage and over the head
sheaves, down to the engine located in the lower part of the structure.
The force to be applied to the cables will therefore be half of that com-
puted from the center, and will operate through double the distance; that
is, 62.500 pounds 46 feet 2 inches.
We are now in position to discuss the adaptability of the various forms
of motor proposed for handling the machine.


From the foregoing, the expenditure of power demanded is 62,500
pounds at a rate of 461.6 feet per minute (46.16 ft. in 1-10 min.) =874
H. P. exerted for 1-10 mim-te.
In the case of a car of lump coal the two rolls which succeed the first
will require less power, since approximately 100,000 pounds of the load has
been discharged. Making a proportionate reduction, the next rolls call for
582 H. P. for I-10 minute each. Averaging these over i'/z minutes, we
have an equivalent of about 136 H.P. used continuously. This is sufficiently
high, for even on a half hour's run the cars are more apt to average 2 min-
utes than i'-3 minutes apart, the latter being about tfhe shortest interval.
But if we should get thirty fell cars of slack in half an hour, they would
generally require but one roll each, and 874 X 1-10 min. averaged for 1
minute = 87.4 H. P.
The difference between this and the 136 H. P. above, will provide for
such of the latter cars as need rolling up a second time to clear them out.
From the fact that it offers us a choice between generating the power
on the spot and obtaining it from a commercial plant -producing power on
a large scale, electricity would at first sight seem to be a very desirable
medium for the application of power. But, when we consider the great
maximum power called for and its short duration, the wiring from a com-
mercial plant would be very heavy.
If the electricity were generated on the spot, there would be required
either a generating plant equal to the maximum power required, and lying
idle between times, or a plant equal in capacity to the average requirement
1 136 H.P.) with a storage battery of great size and cost. In the case of the
battery there would be danger of damaging it by discharging so much
power so suddenly.
An 875 H. P. motor, too, would be very expensive, and there arc doubts
whether or not so large a motor would stop and start quickly enough to be
available.
Compressed air. on 'the contrary, offers special facilities for storage of
power, for an engine of average power can run steadily compressing ■air
;nto a storage tank from which it can be used in large or small quantities
as needed. It is also free from condensation, which is the chief difficulty
with steam when used intermittently. But, since the pressure of confined
air is approximately proportiinal to the amount compressed into a given
space, the pressure will vary as the air is drawn off for use. Now in order


to keep this variation within limits of pressure at which it can be used, we
must either use exceedingly high pressure for storage and draw off for
use through a regulating valve, or provide so large reservoir capacity that
the amount drawn off at any time will be so small a portion of She total in
storage that the pressure will not fall below workable limits.
The use of high pressure storage will involve increased expense for
high pressure compressors, reservoirs and controlling valves, and a con-
tinuous expense for compressing to a pressure much higher than that at
which it can be used; while the other alternative calls for a tank or reser-
voir so large that it may be objectionable on account of cost, or space occu-
pied, or both.
Hydraulic pressure offers more advantages on some accounts than
compressed air. It has the same facility of storage, the pumps for handling
it are less expensive than air compressors, and it is, of course, equally free
from condensation losses. The fluid is practically incompressible and
therefore must be stored under a movable ram with weights to give it
pressure. This fact affords us an advantage over compressed air in that
the pressure remains sensibly constant till all that has been stored has Ik'cii
used. The incompressibility of the fluid has also one disadvantage in that
as much power must be used for a light load as for a heavy one.
The availability of hydraulic pressure with accumulator storage, as
well as of compressed air, will depend on the relation between mean and
maximum power and the regularity of the intervals at which power is
required. It will readily be seen that if two or more demands for maxi-
mum power are made at intervals so short that the prime mover has not
had time to restore under pressure the fluid drawn off, we must have
storage capacity under pressure sufficient to supply the necessary demands
and permit the pumps to overtake the demand during succeeding longer
intervals.
In order to inquire into the question of storage capacity, let us assume
the use of a pressure well within the range of good practice, say 2,000
pounds per square inch. We require a pull of 62,500 pounds travelling
46 feet 2 inches; or, by reaving the cables so as to multiply the motion of
the piston two, or four, fold, we may use a piston effort of 125.000 pounds
through 23 feet 1 inch, or 250,000 pounds through 11 feet 6'A inches. Using
the latter for the sake of compactness, we have a piston area of 125 square
inches, which, travelling 138J/ inches, sweeps 17,312.5 cubic inches at each


stroke. Now, since the product of pressure and volume is a measure of
the work done, this volume will be the same., so long as we keep the press-
ure constant, whether we i:se the fourfold or twofold reaving of the cables.
We must provide for three strokes of the piston in one half of the
cycle of operation, and none in the other half. Our storage accumulator
ram must then have a displacement equal to three cylinderfuls, less the
amount that will be pumped from the beginning of the first to the end of
the last action of the cycle. This portion consists, as before shown, of three
strokes, six seconds each, and two returns nine seconds each, equal to 36
seconds, in the whole cycle of 90 seconds; and a simple computation gives
us 31.130 cubic inches, 51,938 cubic inches less 20,808 cubic inches, as the
capacity of the accumulator.
Here again we may choose between large area of ram with heavy
suspended weight and short stroke, and a small ram with high lift and a
proportionate reduction of suspended weight. The choice would depend
wholly on circumstances of the case, available room, etc. If we should
take an area as large as 250 square inches (nearly 18 ins. dia.) the required
stroke would lie 124 inches, or, for safety, say It feet. With stuffing box,
guides, etc.. this will need headroom of 25 to 28 feet which may easily be
had in the structure. This will require suspended weights of 500,000
pounds to give the pressure assumed. And it is perhaps worthy of note
in passing that, with the same travel of the ram, the weights to be carried
would be the same no matter what pressure is assumed, except as influenced
by fractional resistance of the plunger. This is evident, since it is work
we are storing, and, with a given limit of motion, the same total force must
be applied to perform the same work.
This system would give a very compact plant of machinery, easily
handled and free from liability to damage. Its adaptability would depend
principally on the cost of the accumulator and its foundation. In this case,
as the location is directly on the river bank and dock, a suitable foundation
for 260 tons or more of concentrated load might prove very expensive.
All the systems above discussed have contemplated the use of steam
boilers with engines or pumps running more or less continuously at mean
rate storing up power to be expended at intervals in large amounts.
The desired result could be attained by the use of steam direct, as in
the old machine first referred to, if steam would admit of a proper storage,
and the difficulty of cylinder condensation could be done away with. In


the old machine, cylinder condensation was one of the chief difficulties and
sources of loss. But there the cylinder was only fairly lagged with non-
conducting covering, and. being single-acting, the rear or outboard end
was left open so that the air was freely drawn in and driven out at each
stroke, thus carrying away a large portion of the heat of the cylinder walls'
during the time that the piston stood still at the end of the stroke.
Cylinder condensation cannot be avoided entirely in any cylinder act-
ing intermittently, but it may be very much reduced 'by taking extra pre-
cautions with cylinder covering, making it double or triple thickness, with
one or two dead air spaces between; and, in a single-acting cylinder, instead
of leaving the end open, fitting it with an end or stopper which, while it
would not seriously interfere with the passage of air to and from the cylin-
der, would act as a regenerator, taking up heat from the outgoing air and
heating that which takes its place at the next stroke, so that less beat would
be carried away from the cylinder walls. This might be made of any per-
manent and porous material as wire gauze or woven mats of loose asbestos
cord, etc.
Steam, after being formed, can only be stored to a very limited extent
and then only at the expense of adding external heat to repair losses by
radiation, etc. But water may be used to a considerable extent as a me-
dium for storing heat under favorable conditions, and the present case
seems to present conditions which will enable us to use a body of water
for that purpose and thereby simplify the plant to a very considerable
degree.
We know that if a body of water under pressure is heated to a tem-
perature corresponding to that pressure, and then the pressure lowered in
any way, a portion of the water will be turned into steam. The heat which
becomes latent in the process will be supplied by irhe body of water present,
and will be sufficient in amount to form enough steam to restore equilibrium
between a new pressure and its corresponding temperature, both of which
will be slightly lower than the original if no heat has been added, or if
insufficient heat has been added to make up for that drawn off in lowering
the pressure. If heat has been applied during the process in quantity suffi-
cient, or nearly sufficient, to make steam equal to that drawn off in the same
time, then, if the demand for steam be stopped suddenly, the pressure will
rise to or above the original and may become dangerous.
If we so proportion a boiler that the furnaces, grates, tubes, etc., are


adapted for supplying to the water heat at a rate equal to the average
demand for power, and containing a body of water sufficient to supply,
without too great a fall of temperature, the heat necessarily becoming
latent in supplying steam enough for two or three successive rolls of the
cage., we will have secured our power storage in a manner to permit its
application to the work direct without the use of intermediate machinery.
This saving due to the greater simplicity of the machinery avoiding
the losses incidental to changes and transfers of power, as well as the less-
ened capital and maintenance accounts and the slower depreciation, will
probably many times offset any losses due to unavoidable condensation.
Now if we proportion the strength of our boiler for a maximum press-
ure of 200 pounds per square inch, and take a cylinder of sufficient area to
do its work with a pressure of 175 or 180 pounds, we may draw Steam from
the boiler in any needed quantity and the accumulated heat in the water
will supply any excess of the demand over the supply furnished by the fire
during the same period. This may be repeated, each time at a slightly
reduced pressure, until time enough can be permitted for the furnace to
again catch up with the demand, or until the pressure falls too low to be
effective.
The same consideration which led to the selection of the short cylin-
der, with the fourfold reaving of the cables, for the hydraulic system will
cause the selection of the same style for the use of steam direct, with the
idded consideration that the short, large cylinder will reduce the area of
exposed cylinder walls as compared with a longer, small one, and thus
diminish radiation and condensation.
As shown in the discussion (page . .) we will require a pull of 62.500
pounds through 46 feet 2 inches, 125,000 through 23 feet 1 inch, or 250,000
pounds through n feet 6^2 inches. Assuming the latter, we find that for
an initial steam pressure of 180 pounds per square inch the area of the
required cylinder will be 1,380 square inches, nearly, or 42^ inches diam-
eter. We may reave our cables over fixed sheaves on one end of the cylin-
der and cross-head sheaves at the other, passing the cables around the
cylinder lengthwise and using the piston rod in compression, or we may
place the fixed sheaves on a separate support beyond the cross-head sheaves,
throwing the piston rod in tension. The rod itself is under better condi-
tions in tension and less length of cables will be needed, but the stresses are
more self contained, less thrown onto the framed structure, when the rud


is in compression. There is also a slight difference in compactness in favor
of the latter. The advantages are about even, and we will assume that
the position with the rod in tension has been chosen.
If we could develop its full strength in fastenings, etc., we could use
smaller, but probably about a 5^-inch rod will be used in such a cylinder.
And since it passes through the steam space we must increase the area of
our cylinder by 23.75 (say 25) sqitare inches to compensate for it, giving
a gross area of 1,414 square inches, nearly 42K' inches diameter.
The net stroke (or ]/\ travel of pulling cable) will be II feet 6^4 inches.
The fact that the accelerating force allowed for can act only in the
first half of the stroke will permit us to economize fuel and reduce the
capacity of the boiler by cutting off s'team before the end of the stroke.
The force required at the end of the stroke is only sufficient to maintain the
•equilibrium of the cage and empty car, which, as we have seen, is only
about twojthirds of the similar force for full load, or 60,600 pounds; re-
duced to the piston. 121.000 pounds. This is so nearly half of the starting
force that we may safely figure on cutting off at 54% of stroke, or say
6 feet 3 inches.
The amount of steam to be furnished at working pressure by the
boiler for each stroke will therefore be (1.395 sq. ins. net area 9.69 sq. ft.)
9.69 square feet X 6.25 ft. = 60.56 cubic feet, or, per cycle oi i'A minutes,
181.68 cubic feet at 180 pounds pressure. This will require the evapora-
tion of 181.68 X -433 r— 78.67 pounds of water, or at a rate of 3.147 pounds
per hour.
Since it is desirable to use the small sizes, or slack, of Ohio or Western
Pennsylvania coal, we may assume an evaporation of 7 pounds of water
per pound of coal, with feed water taken at ordinary temperatures from
the city mains.
The average theoretical heat value of seven representative kinds of
Ohio coal is equivalent to the evaporation of 14.41 pounds of water from
and at 212° F. This equals about 11.63 pounds from 320 into steam at 180
pounds gauge pressure. A boiler efficiency of 60% to 70% reduces this
again to from 7 to 8.14 pounds, from which 7 pounds seems reasonable for
sh.ck or three-fourths coal.
3.147 pounds of water at 7 pounds requires 450 pounds of coal per hour.
Now since a slow uniform rate of combustion is desirable for heat storage
we will assume a rate of 15 pounds per square foot of grate per hour.


This calls for 30 square feet of grate, and consequently a little less than
4 square feet (576 sq. ins.) of cross-sectional area of tubes. If 4-inch
tubes are used this requires 52 or 53 tubes, and smaller tubes should not
be used for bituminous coal unless necessary.
At a rate of 3,147 pounds per hour, we will evaporate during 3 sec-
onds (time of admission of steam to the cylinder) about 2.62 pounds of
water, leaving some 23.6 pounds to be supplied from storage at each filling
of the cylinder.
According to our proposition (page ..) the boiler pressure is to be
200 pounds gnuge. reducible to not less than 180 pounds. Since it is desir-
able that the fluctuation of pressure should be as little as possible at any
instant and at a maximum we must take three cylinderfuls from the boiler
with very little opportunity for restoration, we will assume a fall of not
more than 5 pounds in the pressure at each draft.
The temperature corresponding to a pressure of 200 pounds is 388° F.,
and to 195 pounds is 3860. Each pound of water present can therefore
furnish two B. T. units, and to supply the latent heat of evaporation for
23.6 pounds of water will require 23.6 X 842 -f2^ 9,936 pounds of water.
more or less.
Since water at this temperature may safely be assumed to weigh about
50 pounds per cubic foot, we must provide water space equal to 108 (say
200) cubic feet. As any excess over this amount will only tend to improve
the regulating effect of the heat storage, we will get as much water space
as the type of boiler selected will permit.
The efficiency of heating surface is largely dependent on the type o-f
boiler adopted, and therefore we will determine the ratio of heating sur-
face to grate surface when we have selected the general type of boiler.
In order to prevent foaming or disturbance of the water level by too
great a rush of steam when the throttle is opened, a broad water surface
for disengagement of steam and as large steam room as possible should
be provided. The steam room should, if practicable, be four or five times
the volume of the cylinder to the point of cut-off, or say 240 to 300 cubic
feet. This may be attained by the use of a steam dome or drum, if needed,
with the added advantage of taking 'team from a point higher above the
water line and lessening the chances of entrained water entering the cyl-
inder.
The choice of a type of boiler will l&gt;c largely influenced by the locality


in which it is to he used. The difficulty of getting foundations for set-
tings, etc., will sometimes determine the use of hrick settings or internal
firing, and the requirement of large water space and broad disengaging
surface practically limit us to some type of shell boiler. And srince in
this case the boiler must be placed on a pier or dock, it is probable that a
boiler of the cylindrical marine, or Scotch, type will fulfill as many of the
conditions as any.
Since the length of grate is limited in any case to five or six feet by
the difficulty of firing, we must, in order to get 30 square feet, use two
furnace flues 30 inches diameter inside. This will make the length of grate
6 feet.
If we use the corrugated flues which are usual in this style of boiler
their outside diameter will be about 2 feet 10 inches.
In order to have ample water and steam space, let us try a shell 9 feet
in diameter inside of outer plates, and by the use of extra large flange radii
so place furnace flues, tubes, etc., that the minimum water space between
them and the shell, and up through the center, shall be six inches.
Using a separate combustion chamber or back connection for each
furnace and placing 26 4-inch tubes in each, we can get a spacing of 5
inches, centers vertically, and 6 inches, centers horizontally.
Since the combustion is intended to be slow, the heat required to pro-
duce draft will not be great, and we will expose to the water as large heat-
ing surface as can be obtained without unduly increasing the size of the
boiler, say 30 square feet per square foot of grate, or 900 square feet in all.
This is as great as in marine boilers of this type where the consumption of
coal per square foot of grate is much higher.
If we make the combustion chambers 2 feet long, front to back inside,
each presents a heating surface of 47 square feet, leaving 403 to be
obtained in flue and tubes for each furnace. The flue, with a mean diam-
eter of 2 feet 8 inches, exposes 8.35 square feet, and the 26 tubes 26 square
feet per foot of length. 403-4-34.4 requires 11.71 feet, say 11 feet 9 inches
length of flues and tubes. This gives tubes rather short for their diameter
and their efficiency as heating surface would probably be increased by
using spiral retarders in them.
With 6 inches water space between the combustion chamber and back
head, this fixes the length of the boiler at 14 feet 6 inches, which allows
3 inches to be distributed where needed when deciding on details, thickness
of plates, etc.


When carrying the water line 3 inches above the combustion cham-
bers we have 20.66 square feet of section in the steam room, which multi-
plied by 14 feet 6 inches gives 209 cubic feet of steam room.
The volume of a 9 feet by 14 feet 6 inches cylinder, less 299 cubic feet
and the volume of flues, tubes, and combustion chambers, gives 367 cubic
feet water space. This is 1.8 times the computed amount necestary, though
hardly as much as could be desired for regulating over long periods, but
since it satisfies the conditions we have laid down as necessary, and the
relative volumes of steam room and water space can be altered to a con-
siderable extent by changing the water level, we will leave the fluctuations
in longer periods to be cared for by manipulating the fires.
By the use of a small steam dome to give the steam outlet sufficient
height above the water level the water could be carried even a foot higher,
reducing the steam room and increasing the water space by about 122
cubic feet each. Still leaving the steam room equal to about three cylin-
derfuls and making the water 489 cubic feet, or about 2J/2 times the com-
puted amount.
Of course, in making use of heat storage in the water, special attention
must be given to preventing loss of heat by radiation from the boiler, and
herein lies one of the disadvantages of the type of boiler chosen; for,
instead of being enclosed in the brick walls of a setting, it must be cov-
ered with non-conducting material for that purpose solely. It is probable
that a covering made of 1*4 or 2 inches of plastic asbestos or magnesia
compound with wire netting spaced out to form an inch of closed air
space, covered with an inch or more of hair felt and a metal or canvas
jacket, would prove thoroughly effective.
We have now followed the case through all the considerations which
determined the choice of a motor, and have worked out the elements of a
boiler suitable to supply steam to that motor by storing the excess of heat
from a moderate fire during periods of inaction and giving it out as needed
for short periods of heavy demand for power.
We have determined on a boiler of the Scotch marine type with mod-
erate grate surpace, slow combustion, large ratio of heating to grate sur-
face, large steam room, and a large body of water for heat storage.
The remainder of the design presents nothing but the usual details of
strength-of materials and arrangement of riveted joints, and we need not
follow through them.


TRANSIT ADJUSTMENTS AND TESTS.
J. B. DAVIS, '68.
i. PLATE LEVELS.
a. REM. If found much out, partially adjust the worse one first.
b. DIR.
Preparation.—Set up the transit firmly and level it carefully.
Test —Reverse the transit about its spindle. See if the bubbles read
level. Reverse the transit back to its first position. See if the bubbles
again read level. Repeat these trials, making the necessary corrections in
the setting, or levelling, of the transit, till the bubbles will surely read level
again when the transit is returned to its first position. Then reverse the
transit, as at first, and note the deviations of the bubbles from level
readings.
Correct, by estimation, one-half the deviation of a bubble by means
of the screws that fasten the level tube to the plate
Level the transit carefully again. Test the adjustment as at first.
Repeat the corrections and tests, in this manner, till no deviation appears
when the test is made.
c. Rem. Check screws upon the adjusting screws of the level tubee
(sometimes placed in the end plugs of the level tubes) must be released
before making the correction. These check screws keep the level tubes
longer in adjustment, but may give annoyance in making the adjustment
Do not screw them too tight. Test the adjustment and see that it is correct
after the screws are set.
The vernier plate and the limb plate may not be parallel in their
motions. This may be tested by first adjusting the plate levels about the
spindle with the plates clamped; then releasing the plates and clamping
the spindle: and finally testing the adjustment of the plate levels about the
axis of the vernier plate. If found out of adjustment with respect to the
motion of the vernier plate, after carefully repeated trials, it shows that ths
two plates do not revolve about the same axis. Leave the plate levels in
adjustment with respect to the spindle if the principal work is running
straight lines, and reversion on the spindle" If reading angles is the prin-
cipal work, leave the plate levels in adjustment with respect to the motion
of the vernier plate. In case this defect is serious the transit should go to
its maker and be recentered.
Should it be found impossible to adjust the plate levels, after repeated
careful trials, about either axis of motion, it shows that axis of motion with
with respect to which this difficulty exists, to be badly damaged. Usually
the maker must fix it. Make this test after the transit has had a fall.
2. LINE OF SIGHT. CLOSED WYES.
a. COND. A place to set the transit in is needed where well-defined,
fixed marks can be readily found on opposite sides of it at a distance away


as great as the telescope will show them clearly. It is well to have the
marks at about the same angular distance, above on one side and below on
the other, from the place chosen. The plate levels should be in adjust-
ment, and the reversions of the transit made about the axis they are
adjusted for. *
b. DIR.
Preparations.—Set up'the transit firmly in a suitable place. Level it
carefully. Set the line of sight on a distant, well-defined, fixed mark.
Reverse the telescope about the transit axis and find a similar mark in
apparent line. Turn the telescope back and see if the line of sight strikes
the first mark. Repeat these pointings, making the necessary corrections
in the setting and levelling of the transit till the line of sight will surely
strike the first mark again when the telescope is turned back.
Test.—Release the necessary clamps and reverse the telescope about
both axes. Level the transit if the levels show a slight disturbance. Set
the line of sight on the first mark. Reverse the telescope about the transit
axis and see if the second mark is in apparent line. Turn the telescope
back to the first mark, as before, and, by the same means, make sure the
line of sight will strike the mark. Then reverse the telescope, as at first,
and note the deviation of the line of sight from the second mark.
Correct, by estimation, one-fourth of the deviation of the vertical cross
wire by means of the screws at right angles with it that hold the cross wires
in the telescope tube. Whether the telescope shows objects right side up,
or not, turn these screws as if to increase the apparant deviation. Loosen
the screw permitting the desired movement before turning the other.
Leave the screws under a gentle, even, strain. If the deviation is large,
loosen the other pair of screws slightly, but have a care not to get the ver-
tical cross wire inclined.
Set the line of sight again upon the first mark, as at first. Repeat the
tests, corrections, and tests till no deviation appear when the test is made.
c. REM. This adjustment is required theoretically in reading angles,
but not in running straight lines. It conforms to the best working condi-
tions, however, both optically, and in the field practice.
3 STRIDING LEVEL.
a. DIR. ADJUSTING.
Preparation.—Set up the transit firmly. Level it carefully by the plate
levels, or disc level. Bring the[transit axis over a levelling screw. Clamp
the spindle. Place the feet of the striding level on the bearings for them
on the transit axis. Level the striding level with levelling screws to the
transit. See that it stands freely on its feet, and remains level.
Test.—Carefully lift up the striding level, reverse it, and replace its
feet to the bearings, without jar. In the same manner return this level to
its first position. See if the bubble again reads level. Repeat these rever-
sions, making the necessary corrections in the setting or leveling of the
transit till the striding level bubble will surely read level again when


returned to its first position. Then reverse the striding level as at first,
and note the deviation of the bubble from a level reading.
Correct, by estimation, one-half of the deviation by means of the
adjusting screw, or screws, at one end of the level tube, provided for a ver-
tical adjustment.
Set the striding level, by means of the levelling screws of the transit,
to read, and stand, level again. Test the adjustment as at first. Repeat
the corrections and tests, in this manner, until no deviation is shown by
the test.
b. REM. In making this adjustment stand the striding level verti-
cally over the bearings. Do not incline it. If inclined it may show this
adjustment apparently imperfect. This requires a second adjustment side-
wise to bring the axis of the level tube into a plane parallel to the line of
the points of support of the feet of the striding level.
c. DIR. Adjusting side-wise.
Preparation.—Make the last adjustment as perfect as practicable.
Test.— Incline the striding level slightly on its feet. Return it to its
first position. See if the bubble again reads level. Incline it in the oppo-
site direction about the same amount. Return it again to its first position.
See if the bubble again reads level. Repeat these trials, making the nec-
essary corrections in the setting or levelling of the transit, till the bubble
will surely read level again when returned to its first position, and stand at
the same reading when inclined. Then incline the striding level, as at first,
and note the deviation of the bubble from a level reading. Incline it a like
amount in the opposite direction and note the deviation.
Correction.—By means of the screws for a sidewise adjustment set the
level tube so it will show the same deviation in the same direction for the
same inclination either way from its vertical stand, when tested as above
described.
d. REM. The bubble should read level in all three positions. If it
does not the bore of the glass tube is not uniform, and it should be replaced
by a perfect one at the first opportunity. In using such a striding level
be very careful to stand it plumb on its feet.
This adjustment, and the preceding, need to be made alternately
together when first the bubble tube is attached to its base.
If, for any reason, the bubble tube has to be disconnected from its base,
loosen but one of the sidewise screws and notice how tight it is. Likewise,
if there is a check screw to the vertical adjustment, leave it alone,--only
unscrew the adjusting screw. When the bubble tube is again restored to its
connections with its base it can be set almost in its proper place by bring-
ing the loosened screws to their bearings again, and not require so much
adjustment.
4. TRANSIT AXIS TRUNIONS. ROUNDNESS.
a. DIR.
Preparation.—Separate the transit axis from the telescope. Clean its
trunions and their bearings in the wyes of the transit. Set up the transit


firmly in a place of an even temperature. Level the transit carefully.
Clamp the spindle so the transit axis will stand over a levelling screw.
Place the transit axis in its wye bearings. Stand the striding level on the
transit axis with its feet on the trunions. Level the striding level carefully
with the levelling screws to the transit. Reverse it and put it in adjust-
ment. Level the striding level carefully again and see that everything is
stable, and steady, so the striding level will stand level.
Test.— Lift the striding level off. Replace it carefully. See if it reads
level again. Repeat this test, making any corrections that may be needed
in the setting or levelling of the transit, or adjustment of the striding level,
or otherwise, till the bubble of the striding level will surely read level
again when replaced, and stand level.
Lift the striding level off. Turn the transit axis slightly in its bearings
Replace the striding level as before, —do not reverse it. Notice if it still
reads level. Remove the striding level; turn the transit axis back to its
first position; replace the striding level, as before; and see if it again reads
level. Repeat this test; make sure of the stability of the apparatus, and
of the reading of the bubble of the striding level after the transit axis is
turned.
So test the transit axis by turning it a little more at each trial till it has
been examined entirely round its trunions and returned to its first position.
b. REM. Whenever the striding level fails to read level in these
tests it shows that the trunions are not round.
Theoretically, this method will not show which trunion is not round,
but in practice a marred trunion is easily found by looking for the defect
shown by the striding level. In any case this method may be used to prove
the trunions to be round. 13y providing a support for one foot of the strid-
ing level while the other rests on a trunion, that trunion can be examined
separately. Usually the transit axis must go to the maker to be refitted,
and the transit may have to go with it. The finest transits must always go
to the maker for this defect to be removed. The trunions of the transit
axis of a transit of not as fine a grade have been smoothed and made of
the same size by soft wood clamps, oil, flour of emery, and turning the
transit axis by hand, while a trunion was held in the clamps where the oil
and emery had been applied. This was so successfully done that the strid-
ing level in use with the transit would show no difference of any kind
between the two trunions. Such a thing is not recommended for general
practice, but may serve when nothing better can be done, except at a great
loss of time and much expense. When emery is used in any form about an
instrument, the utmost care must be taken to get rid of it all. It is so lia-
ble to do most serious injury to the moving parts that its use is prohibited
by many persons and tripoli, or even pumice, substituted. Nothing coarser
than flour of emery should ever be used.
5. TRANSIT AXIS TRUNIONS. EQUAL SIZE.
a. DIR.
Preparations.—Open the wye clips; take out the transit axis; and


clean the trunions and their bearings in the wyes. Set up the transit
firmly. Level it carefully. Clamp the spindle so the transit axis will
stand over a levelling screw. Place the transit axis in its wye bearings.
Stand the striding level on the transit axis with its feet on the trunions.
Level the striding level, carefully, with the levelling screws of the transit.
Reverse it and put it in adjustment. Level the striding level again as at
first. See that everything is stable, and steady, so the striding level will
stand level.
Test.—Set the striding level off. Lift out the transit axis carefully,
reverse it, and replace it in the wyes without jar. Replace the striding
level without reversing it. Notice if it still reads level. Remove it as
before. Restore the transit axis to its first position without jar. Replace
the striding level. See if it again reads level. Repeat these trials. Make
sure of the stability of the apparatus and of the reading of the level when
the transit axis is reversed.
b. REM. If the level does not read level when the transit axis is
reversed it shows the trunions to be of different sizes. They must usually
be fitted by the maker, but may be treated as noted in 4. This method
tests for differences in size. Should a difference be shown, the trunions are
not made with precision enough for the striding level, or the level is too
sensitive for the transit.
Professor Durand's three-point calliper may be made to give still more
delicate tests for roundness and differences in size.
Theoretically this test will show whether the two trunions have a com-
mon axis. Practically, this defect would have to be so large as to be a dis-
grace to shops of the present day, for it to appear. Trunions are turned to
the same size, even when using the term size with rigid precision. That
is, the trunions are so nearly of a size that if the tests appear to show a dif-
ference, that difference is quite likely due to the errors of the test (obser-
vation, apparatus, temperature, etc.), instead of to the difference in size of
the trunions. Some very elaborate tests would seem to confirm this view.
A level bubble can be read with as much more precision, with a read-
ing glass than without as the graduations of the plate can.
6. LEVELLING THE TRANSIT AXIS.
a. DIR. Set up the transit and level it carefully with the plate levels.
Stand the striding level on the transit axis over a levelling screw. Level
the striding level carefully with the levelling screws of the transit. Reverse
it and put it in adjustment. Level the striding level as at first. See that
everything is steady so the striding level will stand level. Turn the transit
one-quarter round on its spindle axis and level the striding level again.
Turn the transit back to its first position,—do not reverse it. Level the
striding level. By repeated trials set the transit, by means of the levelling
screws, so the striding level will stand level in either position of the transit.
Test the striding level again for its adjustment. Repeat these operations
till the striding level shows the transit axis to be level in both positions of
the transit and itself is in adjustment at the final test.


b. REM. The transit axis will then be level, but the spindle axis will
not be vertical unless these axes are in adjustment. This adjustment is
pven in 9. It may be tested and made at the time of levelling the transit
axis by the second method given for this adjustment in 9, f. Then the
transit will be completely levelled by means of the striding level. It will
be much more precisely set than any plate levels can set it. In the better
grades of transits, the plate levels are for approximate setting only.
7. LINE OF SIGHT. OPEN WYES.
a. COND. Select a place for making this adjustment in, from which
.1 well-defined, fixed mark can be seen when the telescope is pointed level,
or nearly so, and as far away as the telescope will show it plainly. Use the
striding level to the transit axis. The trunions of the transit axis must be
round, of the same size, and centered on the same axial line.
b. DIR.
Preparations.—Set up the transit firmly in a suitable place. Open the
wyes. Level the transit axis carefully with the striding level as directed in
6. Set the line of sight on a distant, well-defined, fixed mark, with the
transit axis levelled. Remove the si riding level.
Test.—Carefully lift the telescope from the wyes; turn it over, the
objective directed towards the mark, and replace it in the wyes without jar.
Replace the "striding level and see if the transit axis still stands level.
Remove the striding level. Restore the telescope to its first position.
Replace the striding level. See if the line of sight again strikes the mark
and the transit axis is level. Repeat these trials, making the necessary
corrections in the setting or levelling of the transit, or the adjustment of
the striding level, till sure that the transit axis stands level in both posi-
tions, and the line of sight strikes the mark in the first one. Leave the tel-
escope in its second position. Notice the deviation of the line of sight
from the mark.
Correct one half of this deviation by means of the cross wire screws at
right angles with the vertical cross wire, as directed in 2, b.
Set the line of sight again upon the mark, as at first. Repeat the pre-
parations, tests, corrections, preparations and tests, till the test shows no
deviation.
c. REM. This adjustment can be made in the way described in 2 for
closed wyes, when the telescope can be reversed on the transit axis.
8. AXES. CLOSED WYES.
a. Cond. The plate levels should be in adjustment. The line of
sight should be in adjustment. The objective slide should be in good
line. If the transit has a telescope level, or other delicate level, it should
be levelled by it as directed in 9, b or 10, b. In making this adjustment,
the telescope should be turned through a vertical angle of about go",—
from about 450 above, to about 45 below, the horizon.


b. DIR.
Preparations. —Set up the transit firmly near some high, well-defined,
fixed mark, so that when the telescope shall be directed to it the elevation
will be about 45°. Level the transit carefully, as above noted. Set,the line
of sight on the high mark. Read, or estimate, the angle of elevation.
Direct the telescope at the same angle below the horizon, on the same
side of the transit. Find, or fix, a mark in apparent line. Turn back to
the upper mark and see if the line of sight again strikes it. Repeat the
pointings at both marks, making the necessary corrections in the setting
and leveling of the transit, and in the position of the lower mark, till sure
the line of sight will strike both marks with the transit carefully levelled.
Test.—Release the necessary clamps. Reverse the telescope about
both axes. Set the line of sight upon the upper mark. Notice if the tran-
sit is still level. If not it must be reset, the levels adjusted if need be, and
the whole preparations repeated. Having made sure of the setting of the
transit and the pointing of the line of sight, direct the telescope downwards,
as before, and find, or fix, a second mark in apparent line, with the same
care, and tests, used in locating the first mark. See if the two lower marks
are the same, or in exact line. Leave the telescope so as to show this.
Correction. — Move the vertical cross wire over one-fourth of the
apparent distance between these two lower marks, by raising, or lowering,
one end of the transit axis, by the device provided.
Prepare for and make a test of the adjustment, as at first. Repeat
these tests, corrections, and tests, till the test shows the lower marks in
the same line, or as one.
c. REM. This adjustment sets the axes at right angles with each
other. It, theoretically, enables one to measure correctly the angle between
the vertical planes of lines having very different angles of elevation.
9. AXES. OPEN WYES.
a. REM. The axes may be adjusted in the way given for closed wyes
in 8. This process involves levelling the transit with the striding level
independently of the adjustment of the axes, which adjustment is involved
in the usual process of thus levelling the transit. If the striding level
feet do not stand on the transit axis trunions, use the process for adjusting
the axes given in d below. If the transit has a delicate level attached it
may be levelled by that, according to the next paragraph, or according
to io, b.
b. DIR. Levelling with the Transit Axis Striding Level. Set up
the transit firmly and level it carefully with the plate levels. Place the
striding level in position. Turn the transit on its spindle so the striding
level will stand over a levelling screw. Level the striding level carefully
with the levelling screws to the transit. Turn the transit one-quarter round
and level the striding level again. Turn the transit back to its first posi-
tion,—do not reverse it. Level the striding level again. Turn the transit
to its second position,—do not reverse it. Level the striding level again.


By repeated trials set the transit by means of its levelling screws so the
striding level will read level in cither of these positions.
Reverse the transit on its spindle. Notice the reading of the striding
level. Reverse back again and see if the striding level now reads level.
Repeat these reversions, making the necessary corrections in the setting or
levelling of the transit, till the striding level will certainly read level in
the first position and return to the same reading always in the reversed
position of the transit. Leave the transit reversed. Note the deviation of
the bubble of the striding level from a level reading.
Correct one half this deviation by the vertical adjusting screw of the
striding level tube.
Repeat the levelling as first noted above, then the reversions, and
make any further correction that may be needed in the setting of the strid-
ing level tube by its vertical adjusting screw, as before.
Continue these operations till the striding level will read lev»l in
both positions of the transit when it is reversed.
By the same means set the striding level so it will read level when
the transit is turned one-quarter round, and reverse as before.
Proceed with these experiments till the striding level is set to read
level in any position of the transit when turned around on its spindle,—or,
speaking theoretically, till the striding level will stand level during a com-
plete revolution of the transit on its spindle.
c. REM, The spindle will then stand plumb. The striding level will
be adjusted to the spindle and not to its feet by this process. Any such
delicate level on the transit may be similarly treated and used to level the
transit by. The telescope level, or the vernier level, being provided with a
slow-motion screw, may be set by that instead of an adjusting screw as
above described. This is detailed in 10, b.
d. DIR. For adjusting the Axes. First Method.
Preparations.—Set up the transit firmly near some high, well-defined,
fixed mark, so that when the telescope shall be directed toward it the ele-
vation will be about 45°. Level the transit as directed in b or in io,b. Set
the line of sight on the high mark, noticing the level to sec that the transit
stands steady. Read or estimate the angle of elevation. Direct the tele-
scope at the same angle below the horizon, on the same side of the transit.
Notice the level again and see that it reads level. If not, repeat these oper-
ations till it does, and both transit and level work satisfactorily. Then
find, or fix, a mark in apparent line. Turn back to the upper mark and see
if the line of sight again strikes it. Notice the level again and see that it
reads level. Repeat the pointings at both marks, noticing the level, and
making the necessary corrections in the setting and levelling of the tran-
sit, also in the position of the lower mark, till sure the line of sight will
strike both marks with the transit carefully levelled.
Test. -Release the necessary clamps. Reverse the telescope about
both axes. Set the line of sight upon the upper mark. Notice if the tran-
sit is still level. If not, it must be reset and levelled as directed in b or in


10, b. Having made sure of the setting of the transit and the pointing of
the line of sight, direct the telescope downwards as before, and find, or fix,
a second mark in apparent line, with the same care, and tests, used in loca-
ting the first mark. See if the two lower marks are the same, or in exact
line. Leave the telescope so as to show this.
Correction.—Move the vertical cross wire over one-fourth of the appar-
ent distance between these two lower marks, by raising or lowering one end
of the transit axis by the device provided.
Prepare for, and make a test of the adjustment, as at first. Repeat
these tests, corrections, and tests, till the test shows the two lower marks in
the same line, or as one.
e. REM. The process of b, c and d, will reveal defects of construe
tion that can be shown by the striding level. For this reason the exam-
inations noted in 4 and 5 should be the first made. The process in b will
not show a difference in the size of the transit axis millions.
f. DIR. For Adjusting the Axes. Second Method.
Preparations.—Set up the transit firmly and level it carefully with the
plate levels. Place the striding level in position. Turn the transit on its
spindle so the striding level will stand over a levelling screw. Level the
striding level carefully with the levelling screws to the transit. Remove
the striding level, reverse it, and replace it, as in adjusting it. See if it is
much out of adjustment. If it is, adjust it approximately.
Level the striding level carefully with the levelling screws to the tran-
sit. Turn the transit one-quarter round and level the striding level again.
Turn the transit back to its first position,—do not reverse it. Level the
striding level again. Turn the transit to its second position, — do not
reverse it. Level the striding level again. By repeated trials set the tran-
sit, by means of its levelling screws, so the striding level will read level in
either of these positions.
Adjust the striding level by the process of 3, a as perfectly as possible.
Level the transit again, as above directed. Test the adjustment of the
striding level. Repeat these operations till sure the transit stands steady,
the striding level is in nice adjustment, and that it reads level in cither
position of the transit.
Test.—Reverse the transit on its spindle. Notice the reading of the
striding level. Reverse back again and see if the striding level still reads
level. Repeat these reversions, making the necessary corrections in the
setting, or levelling of the transit, or the adjustment of the striding level,
till the bubble will certainly read level in the first position of the transit,
and return to the same reading always in the reversed position. Leave
the transit reversed. Note the deviation of the bubble of the striding level
from a level reading.
Correct one half this deviation by raising, or lowering, one end of the
transit axis, by the device provided.
Prepare for and make a test of the adjustment, as at first. Repeat
these tests, corrections, and tests, till the test shows the striding level


always to read level. Last of all try the striding level for adjustment on
its own feet. If not in adjustment repeat the work.
g. REM This is the usual "way of levelling the transit; levelling the
transit axes; adjusting the axes; and adjusting the striding level, all at
one time.
10. TELESCOPE LEVEL TUBE.
a. REM. Telescope level tubes are attached by nuts permitting a
vertical motion at each end of the level tube, and without any sidewise
adjustment, such as is commonly seen on the wye level, and on striding
levels. This makes it important that these level tubes be carefully set
by the maker, and that the glass bubble tube be placed, and fastened, in
its brass case with every care. Striding levels are used, fitting on collars
turned on the body tube of the telescope. These may be adjusted in every
particular. They are very easily attached and detached, will not fall off,
and can be used on the telescope when it is either side up. The ability to
completely adjust them mikes them more desirable than the old form,
even if provided with a double ground bubble tube, reading either side up,
which is protected by a loose brass shell outside the brass case of the bub-
ble tube. All such bubble tubes should be scaled directly on the glass
itself, not by a brass scale standing over it.
This adjustment is for the purpose of setting the level tube, or the hor-
izontal cross wire, so the bubble will read level when the line of sight is
horizontal. With the level tube attached to the telescope body tube, as
first above noted, the level tube is adjusted and there is no very good way
of setting the horizontal cross wire in its best position in the telescope. -
With the striding level standing on collars turned on the outside of the
body tube, the cross wires are adjusted and the horizontal wire brought to
its best position in the telescope. With the striding level no aid is required
—one can make the adjustment-alone.
To adjust the attached telescope level there are three principal steps.
First, levelling the transit with the telescope level. Secoiid,setting the line
of sight horizontal. Third, setting the level tube and testing the adjust-
ment. This method of levelling the transit is necessary or the delicate
telescope level would be made to depend upon the plate levels.
b. DIR. For levelling the transit. Set up the transit firmly. Level
it carefully with the plate levels. Set the telescope level tube to read
level by means of the clamp and slow motion screw to the transit axis.
Reverse the transit on its spindle. Notice the telescope level reading.
Reverse back. See if the telescope level reads level again. If not, set it
to read level again. Reverse the transit again and notice the telescope
level reading. Continue these reversions, making the necessary correc-
tions in the setting of the transit and the telescope level, till it will cer-
tainly read level in the first position of the transit, and return to the same
reading always when the transit is reversed. Leave the transit reversed.
Note the deviation of the bubble of the telescope level from a level
reading.


Correct one half of this deviation by the slow motion screw to the
transit axis.
Level and reverse the transit again, as before.
Repeat these operations till the telescope level will read level in
cither the first, or the reversed position, of the transit.
Turn the transit one-quarter round and level it again, as above set
forth.
By repeated trials, making the necessary corrections in the setting of
the transit and the telescope level, as above directed, make this level read
level for any position of the transit when turned on its spindle.
c. DIR. For setting the line of sight level. Level the transit as
above directed. Leave the telescope clamped. Measure off, each way
from the center of the transit, the same distance, say 150' or 200', and drive
a stake till firm, at the end of each measurement. Number these stakes 1
and 2. See that the transit is level and stands steady. Take accurate rod
readings on the tops of the stakes. Subtract the reading on 1 from the
reading on 2 and preserve the sign of the result, + or —. Call this
result k.
Move the transit to a place, a short distance, say 30', beyond stake 1,
carrying the telescope clamped as last used. Set up the transit here and
level it as directed in b. Take a rod reading, r,, on stake I and another, rt,
on stake 2, just as the first ones were taken. Record these with their num-
bers. Find r2—r„ noting the sign. Call this k'. See if k = k'. Make
sure of the whole work.
If k =k' the line of sight is horizontal and the level tube in adjust-
ment. If k' does not equal k, measure the distances from the transit's cen-
ter to stake I, d^ and to stake 2, d2. Find a rod reading, R2, for stake 2 by
the following equation, observing all signs:
R. = r» + d7^d:ld' (,)
Hold up the rod on stake 2 (set at this reading, R2, if a target rod), and
by means of the slow motion screw to the transit axis, set the line of sight
so it will give the rod reading, R2, on stake 2.
Test by taking a new rod reading, R, on 1. Find R2 — R„ observing
the sign of the rsesult. See if the result equals k.
Proceed with these trials and tests till the line of sight is set so that Rj
— R, at a test, equals k, or so near it that the experiments show it to be
useless to try further.
d. DIR. For setting the level tube. Set the level tube to read level
by means of the nuts at one end of it. Start that nut first that will permit
the desired movement Leave the nuts under a gentle even strain.
Test the level tube adjustment by additional rod readings and finally
set it so that R2 — R, = k when the bubble stands level,— or as near this
condition as can be.
e. REM. If the ground is near enough level, drive the stakes so the


first rod readings on them will be equal. Then k = o. Proceed as above
directed after that, but use the equation below instead of (i), observing all
signs.
R2 = r»-d, -d, (2)
With some experience in making this adjustment, probably the equations
will be dispensed with.
f. DIR. Double ground level tube. Adjust as directed in b, c, d, and
e, above, using but one side. Release the necessary clamps; reverse the
telescope about both axes; and set the line of sight horizontal by means of
the rod readings on stakes 1 and 2. See if the bubble of the telescope level
reads level. Repeat the observations and rod readings till sure the line of
sight is level, the transit steady, and the buble gives the same reading.
Note the deviation of the bubble from a level reading.
Set the bubble to read level by means of the slow motion screw to the
transit axis. Take a rod reading on stake 2,—the distant stake.
Move the horizontal cross wire by means of the screws at right angles
with it, that hold the cross wires in the telescope tube, and set it so the rod
reading on stake 2 will equal the half sum of the former rod readings on
this stake,—the one when the line of sight was level, and the one when
the bubble read level. Whether the telescope shows objects right side
up or not, turn these screws as if to increase the apparent deviation of the
second rod reading from the first. Loosen the screw permitting the desired
movement before turning the other. Leave the screws under a gentle even
strain. If the difference between the two rod readings is large, loosen the
other pair of screws slightly, but be very careful not to turn the cross wire
ring. Be certain the transit stands steady and the rod readings are correct.
Set the line of sight again level by means of rod readings on both
stakes.
Set the level tube to read level by means of the nuts at one end of it.
Start the nut first that will permit the desired movement. Leave the nuts
under a gentle, even strain.
Test the level tube adjustment by additional rod readings and final'y
set it so that R, — R, — k when the bubble stands level,—or as near this
condition as may be.
Release the necessary clamps, and reverse the telescope about both
axes. Set the line of sight level by rod readings on both stakes. See if
the bubble of the telescope level (now the same side up again as at first
adjusted) reads level. Repeat the observations and rod readings till sure
the line of sight is level the transit steady, and the bubble gives the same
reading. Note the deviation of the bubble from a level reading.
If this is considerably less than before, for the other side of the bub-
ble tube, make the same observations and adjustments for this side as
above detailed for the other.
Release the necessary clamps, reverse the telescope about both axes


and make the test just above noted, anew for the side of the bubble tube
which is again uppermost.
Repeat these trials, adjustments, and tests, till the telescope level, and
the horizontal cross wire, are so set that the line of sight will be level when
the bubble reads level whichever side up the bubble tube may be, as shown
by rod readings on both stakes.
If persistant trial under favorable conditions of light, seeing, tempera-
ture, and steadiness, does not complete these adjustments so they will bear
the test imposed, or very nearly so, repeat the work and make these adjust-
ments so the two sides of the bubble tube will read the same (not a level
reading) when the line of sight is level. Record this reading, and fasten
it in the transit box.
g. REM. By these last adjustments the horizontal cross wire is set
nearer its proper place in the telescope tube, if not at that place. The
trouble of these adjustments shows the value of such a level tube in such
a place. Once the level tube is proven to be ground alike on both sides it
makes matters somewhat easier. Even with a perfect level tube there can
be no sidewise adjustment and the device is not nearly as perfect as that
of a striding level standing on collars turned on the body tube of the
telescope.
h. DIR. Horizontal cross wire. Striding telescope level.
Preparations.—Set up the transit firmly. Level it carefully with its
plate levels. Clamp the spindle so the telescope will stand over a levelling
screw. Clamp the telescope level,—as shown by its striding level. Adjust
the striding level as directed in 3. Level the transit by means of the tele-
scope level as directed above in b. ' See, at the last, that the striding tele-
scope level remains in adjustment with respect to its own feet.
Direct the telescope to some object and find a mark on it in line with
the horizontal cross wire when the transit is carefully levelled by the tele-
scope level, and that level is in good adjustment. Prove the steps and
make sure the conditions are favolable.
Test.—Release the necessary clamps. Reverse the telescope about
both axes, and set it level as before. Be sure the striding level keeps its
adjusment. Note the deviation of the horizontal cross wire from the mark
it covered before.
Correction.—Move the horizontal cross wire by means of the screws
at right angles with it, that hold the cross wires in the telescope tube, and
set it so it will cover a place midway between the two marks above noted,
when the telescope is level.
Test the adjustment as at first. Repeat the test, correction, and test, till
the horizontal cross wire will cover the same mark with the telescope either
side up, and level.
i. REM. This arrangement of a telescope level is the best for
general use. The same striding level may be made to fit the transit axis
also.


11. VERTICAL CIRCLE VERNIER.
a. REM. If the telescope is provided with a level, as above noted in
10, it may be put in adjustment, or the horizontal cross wire adjusted, as
directed in that section; the line of'sight set horizontal; and the vernier of
the vertical circle set to read zero when the line of sight is level. This is
best, when practicable.
Some transits have a vertical arc in the place of a full circle. Some
have two opposite verniers to the vertical circle, some but one. Some tran-
sits have two opposite verniers and two opposite sectors of a vertical circle
fitting these verniers. With oppos'te verniers an examination should be
made to ascertain if the verniers give readings at 180 apart, or sufficiently
near so,—that is within a reasonable limit of instrumental precision, tem-
perature, perfection of construction, and closeness of reading considered.
This will be ascertained by taking numerous readings on different parts
of the circle, or opposite- sectors, both direct and reversed, and comparing
them.
If the transit has no telescope level, and but one vernier to its vertical
circle, or the verniers and circle, or opposite sectors, are not well centered,
and in good working order, this adjustment must be made by the peg
method given for the telescope level in 10, c and d,—the levelling being
done by the plate levels. This adjustment then must depend upon the
least sensitive of the plate levels,--the one parallel to the telescope. To
provide against this, a delicate level is attached to the bar carrying the
opposite verniers, on transits having such, which is controlled by a slow
motion screw similar to the one used for the transit axis. This level may
be used to level the transit with, as directed in 10, b. These conditions
call for several forms of this adjustment, as was the case wirh the telescope
level. These are indicated above, except the one given below.
b. DIR. Full vertical circle. Opposite verniers.
Preparations.—Set up the transit firmly. Level it carefully by the
plate levels. Complete the levelling by the level for the verniers of the
vertical circle, if there is one, as directed in 10, b. Set the vertical circle
to read, Y'ernier A o° 00' 00" and Vernier B 180' 00'00". Turn the transit
on its spindle; direct the telescope to some object; and find a mark in line
with the horizontal cross wire. See that the transit is steady and the levels
to be trusted.
Test.—Release the necessary clamps reverse the telescope about both
axes; see that the levels show the transit to be steady and levelled; and set
the vertical circle to read Ver. A 180 oo' 00" and Ver. B o~ 00' 00". Note
the deviation of the horizontal cross wire from the mark at first in range
with it.
Repeat the steps of this process till sure of the result shown. Leave
the transit so the telescope shows the deviation.
Correction.—Set the line of sight midway between its two pointings,
by means of the slow motion screw to the transit axis. Set the verniers by


means of their slow motion screw, or such other device as is provided, to
read 0° oo' oo" and 180° o' oo", or one at 0° oo' oo'', and record the read-
ings of both. Fasten these last readings in the transit box.
Set the level to the verniers to read level, if there is one, after setting
to read 0° oo' oo" and l8o° oo' oo" as above.
Test the adjustment as at first. Repeat the preparations, tests, correc-
tions, preparations, and tests, till the line of will strik the same mark which
ever side up the telescope may be when the verniers are set for a level
line of sight, and the transit carefully levelled, - or as nearly as can be to
these conditions.
12. LINE OF SIGHT.
If a transit has a telescope level attached to its body tube, it being in
adjustment in respect to the line of sight, and it is necessary to adjust the
vertical cross wire,as in 2, some work may be saved by levelling the transit
for that adjustment with the telescope level, setting the line of sight level,
and observing some mark in line with the horizontal cross wire, before
beginning the adjustment of the vertical wire. After the vertical wire is
adjusted set the horizontal wire on the same mark, first seeing that the
transit is as .well levelled, as before, and adjust the telescope level to read
level again, in case it need it.
It is especially easy to derange the cross wires whenever all four cross
wire screws are loosened.
If the telescope level is a sliding level it is so little work to adjust the
horizontal cross wire that it had better be done instead of depending on
any such device as here given.
13. CENTERING THE EYE-PIECE.
a. REM. This is for the purpose of clear vision, as one might center
a magnifying glass more carefully over an object to be viewed. Fre-
quently there is no way provided for making this adjustment, and none is
needed.
b. DIR. Set up the transit where the telescope can be directed to the
light,-artificial lifght will do. By means of the four screws like, or sim-
ilar, to the cross wire screws, that hold the ring in the body tube of the tel-
scope, in which the inner end of the eye-piece slides, set that ring so the
cross wires divide the field of symmetrically.
14 THE OBJECTIVE SLIDE.
a. REM. No adjustment of the objective slide should he needed. At
this point the skill of the maker should be manifest. A test is given below
instead of an adjustment. This test will indicate how perfectly the slide
is fitted, if the objective is well mounted, or how well the objective is
mounted if the slide is well fitted. Two imperfections may be present,
or but one of them. An adjustment does not correct the difficulty. It
partly hides it.


b. DIR. Let the transit where a row of stakes can be lined by it with-
out a motion of any kind except changing the focus of the objective.
Clamp the telescope securely with respect to all its motions. Line out a
low of stakes, at measured intervals of fifty feet, to 1,000 or 1.500 feet away.
Use a foresight, either at the end of the line, or beyond it, to keep the
transit steady by. Mark boints on these stakes precisely in line, and at
the measured distances apart.
Move the transit to the other end of the line and by trial set it so the
line of sight covers the end mark, with no motion but focussing the objec-
tive. Leave the telescope so clamped. Line a new set of points at the
same places as before. Note their deviations. There should be none,
theoretically.
This test is with respect to line. A similar test with respect to level
may be made by setting points on the sides of tall stakes in the line of the
horizontal cross wire. The horizontal cross wire cannot be easily set to
cover the end marks in the second position of the transit. Set the tele-
scope, by means of the slow motion screw to the transit axis, so the line of
sight, by the horizontal cross wire, will pass at equal distances from, and on
the same side of, the end marks. Make a new line of marks. Measure
the spaces between these and the former marks. They should be equal,
.theoreticallv.
AN IRRIGATION INVESTIGATION.
C. T. JOHNSTON, 95.
Irrigation is probably as old an art in the Western Hemisphere as it is
in the Eastern. Along the Salt River Valley in Arizona, in Southern Colo-
rado and Utah, and in northwestern New Mexico the traces of irrigation
works indicate an ancient civilization superior to that found by the Spanish
explorers. Water-ways were built and irrigation was practiced before the
advent of the Indian. The canals of these ancient peoples followed a grade
and conformed to other modern practice so closely that portions of the old
channels have been repaired and are used today.
The value of irrigated land does not inhere in itself, but in the water
which reclaims it from the desert. To make this value secure water must
belong to the land and not be dealt with as personal property, or in any way
be effected by the doctrine of riparian rights. The prosperity of any people
largely depends on the stability of their titles to the property through which
they gain a livelihood. Land and water must go together to insure the sue-


cess of an irrigated country. In other countries where irrigation was prac-
ticed at an early date, land titles were comparatively definite and secure.
We have nothing to tell us how the original builders of these canals
governed the use of water; its division is a much more difficult task. Hence,
the character of the right to use it is much more uncertain. Not only does
it require engineering skill to measure the volume to be distributed, but
owing to atmospheric changes at the sources of supply, this volume fluctu-
ates. When we say a man or his farm is entitled to ten cubic feet of water
per second we may be allowing him a quantity which at times does not
exist. If he has an early or prior right to use water and yet has an inad-
equate supply, it is difficult to see where those having subordinate rights to
his come in.
Notwithstanding the antiquity of irrigation, but little is known as to
how much water is needed for the growth of crops under varying conditions.
Although this quantity has long been known to differ with soil, latitude, alti-
tude, character of crops, and even the quality of the water applied, yet no
measurements have been made until recently which begin the solution of the
various phases of the problem.
Nearly all disputes as to the ownership and use of water in Arid Amer-
ica have been settled by the courts. The courts have inaugurated no study-
as to the needs of the irrigator; they have treated water the same as land
or personal property, without regarding the area it does or may serve to
irrigate, but have given more weight to the claims of the irrigators and the
carrying capacity of their ditches and canals. A student of the problems
connected with the supply furnished by streams, and the judicious division
of this supply among the various users, at once sees that they can only be
solved by engineering skill.
A stream has a public nature which the courts have long ignored. The
doctrine of holding water as personal property has resulted in sufficient
litigation in some of the states to pay for all the irrigation works con-
structed therein. This has been avoided in Wyoming and Nebraska by put-
ting the diversion and use of water under the charge of state engineers and
boards controlled by them. All adjudications are made by men equipped for
this particular work. When the rights to use water are to be established for
any stream, the available water supply is determined and each user of water
is allowed only what can be beneficially applied to the land.
This method of dealing with streams has practically eliminated all litiga-


tion in Wyoming and Nebraska. Since 1800, when Wyoming adopted the
present water law, there have been but two cases in the courts bearing on the
subject of irrigation. One of these has been held over since 1885, It has
been in all the courts of the state, and for the past fourteen years has been
a bitter personal fight between two irrigators. Recently the case has assumed
3 new phase. This arose from an attempt on the part of one of the irrigators
to sell the surplus water the court had decreed him to an appropriator hold-
ing an inferior right. The case came on for trial, and the court, in the
face of all the good resulting from the contrary ruling, decreed that such a
transfer was just. This decision, if not reversed in the higher courts of the
state, will cause endless litigation, and the Wyoming law, althoivg'h good in
intent, will be of little benefit to the irrigator. No man's right will be
secure. The "irrigation law-yers" will absorb the profits from the farm. It
will permit speculators to buy up the water of the streams and destroy
homes which have been created and which depend wholly upon the water
supply for their value. It is doubtful whether the time will ever come when
a man educated for another profession can do the work of an engineer.
It seems that the courts have not appreciated the facts which have been so
clearly demonstrated, and prefer to follow a doctrine which, when applied
to the problems relating to irrigation, results in unjust and vicious decrees.
Permitting water to be bought and sold like live stock and held as a chattel
is well illustrated in a case which recently ended in the Oilorado courts.
An early settler built a small ditch during the seventies, and claimed at
that time, in a statement filed in the county clerk's office, about one-half of
the flow of the stream. He could only use a small portion of this volume,
but as he did not know how much w-ater he needed, and only had a vague
idea of what a cubic foot per second or miner's inch was, he made his claim
large enough to be on the safe side. Later on homescekcrs came from the
East and gradually used all the water of the stream during the irrigation
season. Not lor;g ago the original appropriator brought a suit in the courts
in an attempt to recover the water claimed in his early statement. The case
was fought to the end by those who had invested their means in land made
productive by the application of water. The defendants submitted the best
evidence in their behalf, and able legal advisers were secured. However, the
court granted the plaintiff the amount of water claimed in his original
statement. The water which had been used for the irrigation of small farms
was diverted above and turned on to new land farther away from the stream.


THE TECHNIC.
Of course, there is no justice in a decision of this kind. It may be law,
but it is bad practice, and certainly not engineering.
It cannot be denied but that practically all of the court decrees have
been conscientiously rendered. The difficulty is that the courts do not
appreciate, and are incompetent to judge, the value of the engineering facts
which enter into every adjudication of the rights to use water. Every pro-
fession views a question according to the light afforded by special education
and practice Hence, where an engineer would apportion the water of a

stream to all the users in accordance with the amount needed, and the area
and date when first irrigated, the lawyer would adjudicate the rights of as
many as appeared in court and fix the quantity decreed to each according
to the facts presented by the irrigators, and a physician would probably diag-
nose the case and prescribe a course of treatment.
When water right questions were first appealed to the courts but little
was known as to the flow.of the streams, the carrying capacity of the
ditches, the area irrigated, and nothing was known as to the quantity of


water needed. The court did not even appreciate the need of such facts to
make an equitable adjudication. It is not surprising, therefore, that practi-
cally the same case appeared time and again in the courts, serving only to
enrich the "irrigation" lawyer and to impoverish the irrigator who hires him.
Every irrigator knows approximately how much water he uses for vari-
ous crops, but, since he has made no measurements, his information cannot
he put in words. Hence, a judge or other person adjudicating the rights to
use water in his locality cannot be aided by his knowledge. The want of facts
a.'nng this line, as well as the absence of other information relative to irriga-
tion, has led to the establishment of the Irrigation Investigations under the
Department of Agriculture. This office has started its search for truth
along many channels, yet that relating to the duty of water is the most im-
portant. A brief review of this work will make clear the methods adopted.
The first year's work deals with the measurement of water actually
applied to the land. One or more stations have been established in nearly
every arid state, and engineers have been employed to carefully watch the
measurements. There are two common methods for measuring running
water. The fundamental device is a ilume, or box, placed in the ditch or
canal giving the water a rectangular cross-section. The other method is by
the use of weirs. In small canals and ditches, where the conditions permit,
Cippoletti weirs have been installed. These weirs have their sides inclined
from a vertical line at an angle whose tangent is one-fourth. This modifica-
tion of the rectangular weir approximately allows for end contraction, and
reduces the formula of the rectangular weir
Q = 3-3i (L-.2h) h| to
Q = 3.3-2/3 Lh|
In many instances a weir cannot be employed. Where there is an excess
of sediment it has a tendency to settle back of the weir and destroy the rela-
tions which should exist between the depth flowing over the crest and the
jistarce from the crest to the bottom of the structure containing the weir.
Where the grade of the canal is small and the banks low, water cannot be
impounded, and one of the conditions for accurate measurements cannot be
fulfilled. Where a flume is used, the law which governs the relation between
the depths and the corresponding discharges is determined by making as
many gagings of the ditch as possible with different depths. In this way a
series of co ordinates arc determined, one being the depths and the other


THE TECHNIC.
the corresponding discharges. With these observations an equation can be
computed by means of the method of least squares, giving a special formula
in each case. Where flumes are properly constructed and installed the curves
are parabolic. No appreciable error would result if the general equation was
assumed to be

FIGURE 2.
Q = Ly* + my + n,
where Q is the discharge in cubic feet per second, y is the depth in feet,
and L, m and n are constants which are determined in each case. It can be
seen at once from this equation and the equation giving the discharge of the
weir that the volume of water flowing in the channel depends on the depth.


47
If, therefore, a continuous record is kept of this factor, the results obtained
can be converted into the total discharge for the period covered.
Some work has been done in this connection during the past fifteen years
by the state engineers and experiment stations of the west. Several registers
have beer designed for keeping a record of the depth, and they all do this
more or less imperfectly. I will not take space to describe these. Let it be
sufheient to say that they all have their faults. The most serious is that of
rcd.icing the record of depth. That is. if the water increased in depth one
foot, some of the registers indicate it by a rise of one-tenth of a foot; others
in careful weir or fliune measurements, hence a new register had to be
designed. This is shown in Fig. I.

It consists of a horizontal cylinder which revolves with the rise and fall
of the water. The mechanism for producing this motion is shown on the
risfht end of the cylinder. A clock running on guides parallel to the cylinder
keeps account of the time and travels seven spaces in a week. With this de-
vice the exact fluctuations of depth are recorded at the time they occur.
Fig. 2 shows a sheet taken from the register.
\t a glance the depth of water can be determined by any two-hour space.
From the discharge equations, either for the weir or flume, tables have
been prepared giving the volume of water in cubic feet per second for vari-


oils depths. This table has been converted into a second one which gives
the discharge for periods of two hours in acre-feet. The conversion is
made by dividing the numbers in the first table by 6.05, that is. by 43560-f-
7200. The acre-foot is the most convenient unit for expressing large vol-
umes of water, and is used almost exclusively in this office. With these
tables and the register sheets which are sent in each week, the daily volume
used in the irrigation of various crops is determined. Tables are made
showing this volume in acre-feet, and from these tables diagrams are drawn
showing the facts graphically. A diagram (Fig. 3), shown herewith, repre-
sents the amount of water used near Mesa, Arizona.
The column at the right shows the total depth to which the land is
covered, including rainfall.
To make this work valuable, it must be continued for a number' of
years. As soon as the amount now used is determined, the station will be put
under the charge of an experienced irrigator, and no water will be used
except that which aids the growth of plant life. In this way the quantity of
water needed will eventually be determined. When this has been done for
localities of varying climatic conditions there will be a basis for a more
equitable division of the water of our streams. At least one of the excuses
now offered in defense of some of the ridiculous court decrees will vanish
with the publication of the facts dealing with the duty of water. Those
disposed to consider carefully the needs of irrigation law and its adminis-
tration will. I believe, concur in the following statement:—
The work of finding the quantity of water requisite for the growth of
crops, the measurement of streams affording the water supply, and the
determination of the area of irrigated lands, must always be done by an
engineer. After he has collected the facts and has become acquainted with
tire people and the local conditions as the field work will demand, he should
be better qualified to fix the volume each man should receive than a judge
having a lawyer's education and an inclination to follow precedents.
HOUSE DRAINAGE.
A. B. RAYMOND, '91.
In considering the various causes affecting public health, house drain-
age cannot be omitted. To have a healthy community, we must have
healthy homes for the people. One essential requirement for such homes


is an abundant supply of pure air within them. To obtain this, poor ven-
tilation is one drawback, and the fouling of the air by that from our drains
is another requiring our attention. We know that those who live an outdoor
life are more vigorous than those who are confined indoors; also that as
soon as cool weather cc.mes and our families are driven largely to indoor
life, sickness immediately increases, with little abatement until the warm
weather comes again. This indicates that the air we breathe, as well as
the food we eat and the water we drink, has its part in causing poor health.
Many think the contamination by air from our drains is very slight. This
opinion is evidently due to the fact that, drainage work being mostly con-
cealed, they are unaware of the conditions which actually exist.
Let me point out from experience some of these (.sources and the
agency causing an inflow into the home from them. Ventilation to some
extent is taking place in all buildings by the escape of the warm air within
them. Every cubic foot of air thus escaping must be replaced by a corre-
sponding amount from some source, and it will always come in at the point
of 'east resistance. Any openings upon the drainage lines within the building
arc the places from w-hicli contamination is invited. The most common to be
found are as follows:
First, privy vaults in close proximity to the house.
Second, direct communication with the main sewer by untrapped
connections within the building for hopper closets.
Third, cesspools under cellar bottom on account of using crock for
the main drain under the cellar floor to receive the soil waste of the
house. Stoppage is continually taking place from one cause and another
in this drain, and when such occurs the sewage finds outlet through the
joints of the crock under the floor. At the first soft spot in the earth that
it comes in contact with, a settling takes place, and the pool is formed.
This condition will often remain unknown for months before being dis-
covered. We have found several very bad ones the past winter, holding
from one to five barrels of house sewage.
Fourth, untrapped openings in the cellar into the main house drain
to receive the cellar wash. These openings arc generally from two to four
inches in diameter; and this winter, in houses heated by hot air or steam,
we found the current of air coming in through them from the drain strong
enough to extinguish the Haine of a candle held twelve inches above them.
This is a very common defect.

work.
Sixth, openings to the drains from loose joints where the iron and
lead wastes are cemented into the crock drain under cellar bottom.
Seventh, untrapped sink and laundry wastes.
Eighth, if trapped, the seals are broken by syphonage from their own
discharge or from the discharge of other fixtures.
Ninth, unsanitary and unclean fixtures, especially water closets.
Tenth, loose, open joints of the plumbing pipes from poor workmanship.
Eleventh, unventilated toilet rooms opening into the living rooms.
Twelfth, openings left by careless workmen, such as changes in old
plumbing, and a failure to close the waste when a fixture is removed.
These are the most important and common defects from which contam-
ination comes.
There are several methods to discover such places, and one of the best
is the smoke test, as by at they are the most readily brought to notice.
The lines are filled with smoke by a machine manufactured for tins purpose.
If there are any openings, the smoke will appear coming through them and
are easily found, as the smoke can be traced quicker to its sourc- than
can an edor alone.
To remedy these and other evils which we find, steps arc now being
taken by most places to have all drainage and plumbing work done under
municipal control. Without taking .time to go into the details of our regula-
tions, I can point out the main requirements to be desired.
These should be that all drainage work shall be done under the
supervision and control of competent men chosen for this purpose; that no
drainage or plumbing work shall be covered or concealed until it has been
inspected and accepted by the regularly appointed inspector, after the regular
tests have been applied and the work has stood the tests to the satisfaction
of the inspector. The tests which are generally required are the water on
the rough work and the smoke on the final. The first part of the work1
requiring consideration is the drainage of the foundation walls and cellar
excavation. Upon the proper planing of these drains and the efficiency with
which this work is done will depend the sanitary condition of the cellar in
its freedom from dampness. This part should have careful supervision.

Toe often it is left entirely to the drain digger, and the best planned work
is spoiled by careless work on his part. The requirement here is that they
should be laid with a uniform fall to the outlet. The interior of the rain-
water drains shall have a smooth surface, and they shall be deep enough
to receive the cellar and fountain drainage. These drains, which are called
the subsoil and rain-water system, should not connect into the soil drain of
the house, but should connect into the main house sewer outside of the
house trap, being trapped just before entering (see ground plan) ; thus they
will be protected from any air entering them from the main sewer and the
ventilation afforded by the rain-water connections will keep the air within
them sweet and fresh.
The cellar wash and tile drains should connect into the rain-water
drains. The question may be asked, why not connect these lines directly into
the soil drain of the house? The reason is on account of the liability of a
stoppage in the house trap, which would cause the house sewage to back into
these drains, fouling the entire system, and the formation of cesspools under
the cellar bottom, as indicated in the defects to be found on old work.
In our cities they are generally under the cellar bottom on account of the
building occupying the entire ground space, and also on account of econ-
omy in the cost of digging. Whichever plan is adopted, the two systems
should be kept separate as indicated, and for the reason given.
Tlien there will be no fouling of the subsoil drains, as it is very rare,
indeed, that a stoppage ever occurs in the main house drain outside of the
house trap. They do occur, however, from faulty construction, careless
workmanship, and when the lateral or main sewer is not sufficiently deep to
carry off the drainage during a sudden storm without causing a backagc
from being overtaxed by the surface drainage.
Next comes the soil drain of the house. To protect the building
against gas from the main or 'lateral sewer, just before or after it enters
the house, a trap is put upon it, and this is called the house trap. (Scr?
Figures i and 2.) This drain, commencing outside of the house,- should
oc of iron, continued under cellar bottom and extended up through the
building above the roof with open end. To this, just inside of the house
trap, a connection with the outer air should be made fol ventilation.
This connection is called the fresh air inlet, or foot vent. By this con-
struction, a movement of the air is established through the soil system,
keepirg the air comparatively fresh within the lines.

Next, the rooms of the building should l&gt;e protected from the air from
the house drains themselves, for even with ventilation going on within
them, the air in them is more or less foul from the soil which collects upon
the sides of the pipes. Therefore, all interior drainage pipes should be of
lead, steel, cast or wrought iron. When the pipes are in place ready for the
fixtures, and before being covered, they should be required to stand the
water test. After the fixtures are placed ready for use, the work should
he able to stand the smoke test. The manner of making the latter has
already been indicated. The water test is made as follows:—
When the rough work is all in ready for the fixtures, the various open-
ings are securely closed and the pipes filled with water to the top of the
main soil slack extending through the roof. The water is then allowed
to stand for an hour or so to see if the level is maintained. If not, there is
a leak, and it must be found by search and remedied before the work is
accepted. This can be easily done before the work is covered. There are
ways to deceive the inspector in making these tests, and he should be one
who is up to the tricks of the trade. A good inspector is seldom caught,
for he has means to detect fraud, and he should always be on the lookout
for it.
Next comes the protection of the fixtures from air passing through
them from the drain when they are discharged. Each fixture must be sep-
arately trapped and every trap protected from syphonage caused by its own
discharge, or by the rush of the discharge of any other fixture. This is
generally done by what is called a system of venting to afford relief from air
pressure or suction. An independent pipe, the same diameter as the main
soil, is run parallel to it, either extended through the roof or connected
into the soil above the highest fixture, and into this connections are made
from the crown of each trap. Experience has shown that this system is not
always safe on account of these vents becoming stopped from various
causes. They are then a source of danger on account of fancied security
which does not exist. Much of the venting is now discontinued, and resource
is had to anti-syphon traps. Tn work properly designed, syphonage can be
largely avoided. The danger principally comes where the connections arc
made into the side of the horizontal lines, or else into the heel of the lead
bend. Connections taken off the top are safe against syphonage on any
ordinary work.
For an illustration of the change in the style of work now taking place.

from the Christmas issue of the Plumhers' Trade Journal of New York,
1899-1000.
In conclusion, anyone who is about to build should consult with those
who are in charge of the plumbing and drainage work. Their advice
will often save useless expense and protect you from unsanitary construc-
tion. In any case, you have nothing to lose but everything to gain by so
doing.
SINKING A PNEUMATIC CAISSON AROUND A BRIDGE PIER
EDWARD M. ST. JOHN, 95.
Of all the methods in use to get a good foundation for heavy structures,
the pneumatic caisson method always seems the most interesting, the most
wonderful. The idea of working one's way through water, mud, sand, rock,
etc.. to a depth of over one hundred feet below the surface of the water,
and of keeping the water out of the way by means of compressed air, is one
of the triumphs of modern science.
When, therefore, a chance was given the writer to assist in sinking a
caisson, he was very glad to go, even though the country thereabouts had
a reputation of making all new comers sick with chills, fevers, etc. It was
about the middle of November, 1898, that the trip was made to Little Rock,
Ark. It was a night ride, and daylight came when we were about one hun-
dred miles northeast of our destination. The view was dreary, indeed.
At least one-half the country that we passed through was flooded with
water. Now and then we passed a shanty or cotton field, with some natives
standing around waiting for the waters to dry up. We were told that the
country was not flooded like this all the time. Finally Little Rock, the
"Rose City" as it is called, came in sight. The presence of some huge rocks
on the banks of the Arkansas River suggested the name "Little Rock" to the
founders. A much larger rock two or three miles up the river is called Big
Rock. Two of the bridges across the river at this place are owned by the
St. Louis, Iron Mountain &amp; Southern Railway Co. One of these consists
of four fixed spans, through Tratt trusses, and one swing span, making alto-
gether about twelve hundred feet of bridge. The piers are of stone
masonry resting on timber caissons sunk to the rock about forty-five feet
below low water line. These piers and bridges were built in about the year


1884-85. Shortly after being built, the pivot pier, holding up the swing span,
and one other pier, began to lean up stream. This threw the bridge out of
line, and it had to be moved back and wedges put under to level it up in
order to operate the swing span readily. The leaning continued, however,
till in the sumer of 1898 the top of the masonry overhung the bottom by over
a foot, and the turn-table drums had been moved over as near one edge of
the pier as it was safe to put it.
It was then decided to stop the leaning if possible, and the contract
was let to the Missouri Valley Bridge and Iron Works, of Leavenworth,
Kan., Mr. A. J. Tullock, chief engineer, and Mr. L. S. Stewart, superintend-
ent in charge. Work was commenced in September, 1898. A pneumatic tim-
ber caisson was to be sunk surrounding the pier. This part was of itself a
very difficult task, owing to the large size of the caisson, the swift current
and rapid rising of the water in the river, and to the materials encountered
in the .bottom of the river.
As the caisson was to be sunk around a pier already built, it could not
be put together on shore and floated into position, but had to be built
above water around the pier on a pile support and then lowered into the
water. As there were not more than five or six feet of sand overlying the
rock beneath the river bottom, the piles had to have an extra amount of
bracing to keep them upright. The load was to be quite considerable and at
a distance of about four feet above low water mark, making about forty-five
feet that the piles extended above the yielding sand in the river bottom.
This bracing was accomplished by making a loop of chain about eighteen
inches in diameter spiking it to Che end of a 2"xi2"xi8" plank, then letting the
loop down around one of the piles with the plank held nearly vertical till it
was about fifteen feet below the water surface, and the loop being now
around both pile and plank, the top of the plank was brought over, tightening
the chain as it came, till the end of the plank came down alongside another
pile, where it was securely spiked.
The masonry pier is thirty feet in diameter, resting on a square timber
crib thirty-two feet on a side. The crib, which is an extension of the caisson
underneath, reaches up to within one foot of low water mark. The new
caisson to be sunk around this was also square, the inner wall nearest the
pier being forty-six feet on a side and the outer wall being seventy feet on a
rapidly forward, the caisson sinking gradually as the courses were placed on
top. till finally the bottom of the river was reached. The bottom, however,


side, leaving seven feet between the old caisson and the new. and twelve
feet between the outer and inner walls of the new caisson. Six feet above the
bottom or cutting edge of the new caisson was a roof built in from wall to
wall, the space underneath being the air or working chamber, and the
space above for sand filling to give the weight necessary for sinking. South-
ern pine sticks I2"xl2", dressed on four sides, were used in building. The
pine was from the Arkansas forests and was a fine lot of timber. Whole car-
loads would be unloaded of pieces twenty and twenty-six feet long with
hardly a knot in them. As nc objection was made to sap, there was some sap
in the pieces used. The timbers in each course were dapped together, and the
the courses were drift bolted together. Drift bolts were seven-eights ins.
in diameter by two feet ten inches long, and were driven into holes bored
one-sixteenth of an inch less than their own diameter. In this way each
course was securely fastened to two courses below. Drifts were spaced
about three feet apart. Seven courses of the caisson were put together on
the pile support before it was lowered into the water. This included the
cutting edge and the sides and roof of the working chamber. The sides
of the chamber were three and one-half feet thick, and the roof two and
one-half feet thick. All spaces between timbers in the chamber and on the
outside of the walls were carefully calked with oakum.
The lowering of the caisson into water was accomplished as follows:
Imagine the caisson resting on the floor beams of a bridge and instead of the
usual hangers at the ends, screws three inches in diameter are used. These
screws run up through a I2"xi2" cap on the piles, and nuts are screwed on
from the upper end down against this cap, or rather against a washer on the
cap. By turning these nuts the floor beams could be raised or lowered, and
with it the caisson. Wrenches with handles five feet long were used to turn
these nuts, and three men operated each wrench. Twenty-four of these
lowering screws three inches in diameter by twenty-two and one-half feet
long were used, and about eighty men were needed to operate them. All
the nuts were moved simultaneously, the "course around" shouted by the
foreman being the signal for every man to move his wrench a cmarter turn.
The lowering was done at the rate of about one foot per hour.
A calculation of the weight of a cubic foot of timber was made from the
displacement in the water. It was forty-five pounds. This was for unseas-
oned pine cut about one month.
It was a great relief to get the caisson floated. The building now went


was very uneven at this place. The current was swift and the presence
of the bridge pier had caused the bottom to be scoured out in some places
and the sand heaped up in others. So while one part of the cutting edge
of the caisson rested or. sand, under other parts the sand had been washed
out four or five feet lower. The problem now was to get an even bearing
for the cutting edge before the caisson could be weighted down and the air
turned on. The only feasible plan that presented itself was to fill up these
low places with sacks of sand. Sand could be obtained near by .on
the bank of the river. The sacks used were of burlap, and as much sand
was put in each as one man could conveniently carryT This was about one
and eight-tenths cubic feet. These were carried on the flatboat or barge
to the caisson, where they were slid or dropped into the water with as little
disturbance as possible. The low places did not- fill up very rapidly, the
current carrying many of the sacks a distance down stream before they
struck bottom. About twelve thousand sacks were put in before a large
enough proportion of the cutting edge had a support. Thirty or forty feet
out of a total of four hundred and sixty feet of this cutting edge was still
unsupported. On account of the large size of the caisson, and the impossi-
bility of binding- it into a firm, solid structure, great care had to be exer-
cised to keep it from springing or getting in "wind." By observing the
amount of water that each corner was drawing, one could easily see whether
it was in wind or not.
The open space afiove the roof of the working chamber was now filled
in with sand to a depth of about four feet, which was the amount of sand
necessary to hold the cutting edge on the bottom when the air was turned
into the chamber. It would not do to overload it at this time as the sup-
port was not uniform enough to keep it from being twisted and sprung.
The cutting edge was thirty-five feet below the surface of the water, which
means that 35 X -43 = 15 pounds of air per square inch are needed to force
all the water out of the working chamber (.43 being the weight in pounds
of a column of water one foot high and having one square inch cross-sec-
tion). The air, which was supplied by two compressors twelve hundred
feet away on the shore, and was brought out through a 4-inch pipe, was now
turned into the chamber and the water driven out. Men immediately went
in through the lock, and with moist clay stopped up all the small leaks.
Thexe was no difficulty in finding these leaks as the escaping air made a
noise that showed where such openings existed.

The next work was to start the excavation. Although the cutting edge
had a support most of the way around, the space between in the chamber
was not so well rilled up. and while in some places the bottom of the river
was uncovered of water, in others the water was several feet deep. Only
a dozen men could work in the chamber at first. The number was increased
as fa«t as room was made for more till the number reached eighteen or
twenty.
The materials first encountered to be gotten out were sand, consid-
erable of it being in the sacks before mentioned, and some old piles that
had been broken off near the bottom of the river. These old piles were
quite numerous and made rapid sinking an impossibility, as they had to be
cm off by piece-meal a foot or two at a time. When it was possible, a hole
was bored in with an auger, a piece of dynamite was put in and exploded
with electricity. This would cut the pile oft even with the hole.
There were two methods of getting the sand out—the methods being
very similar, however. One was the "wet blow out," and the other the
"dry blow out." Down through the roof of the chamber protruded the 4-in.
discharge pipes, seven in all. placed along at convenient intervals. These
had cut off valves in the ends that were in the chamber. The other ends
were up above the surface of the river. To the end in the chamber, a rub-
ber suction hose, 4 inches in diameter and 15 feet long, was attached. On
the other end of the hose was a nozzle with a three inch opening. This
mizzle was placed down in the water and into the sand and the valve opened.
The air pressure sent sand and water up at great speed. When material
to be excavated is loose and not too coarse this method works very well.
The "dry blow out" method was used when the materials, though not
coarse, had to be loosened with shovel before being blown out. The mate-
rial was put in piles, then when the nozzle was -brought near and the valve
opened, it would be drawn in and forced up and out. Stones two or three
inches in diameter were sent out in this way and hurled three or four hun-
dred feet after leaving the upper end of the discharge pipe.
The cutting edge of the caisson was a 4" X 8" oak strip securely
bolted to the timbers above. The 8" side formed the edge. Excavation
under this edge had to l&gt;e made uniform under all parts of it in order to
keep the caisson level. When rock was reached the descent was of course
slower. This rock was a shaley slate, soft in some places and as hard as
granite in others. Its surface was very uneven. When it was first reached


there were other parts of the cutting edge that had nearly five feet to go
before reaching it.
At this point let us take a trip into the caisson. It is now down in the
rock part of the way around. We first prepare for the trip by putting on
some old clothes, as the mud is over everything down in the "hole." Also
some high-topped rubber boots. We also leave our watches behind as the
compressed air usually docs some mischief by making them run faster or
slower, or stopping them entirely. Tied to the part of the caisson that is
above water is a house boat called the "Sand Hog" boat after the Sand
Hogs, who are the men who work at excavating under compressed air.
This house has two compartments, one for the white men and one for the
black. There is a stove in each kept red hot most of the time to dry the
clothes of the men who are off duty.
After inspecting these quarters, which are kept as clean as one man
can keep them, we go out and onto the caisson. A large round cylinder
is in front of us, rising up through the sand filling. It is about four feet
in diameter and reaches fourteen feet above water. This is the lock.
About ten feet down from the top it reduces in size to fit the 3-foot shaft
that reaches to the chamber below. If any one has a cold or his heart is
weak he had better not go down. The outside lock tender gives five raps
on the lock. It is answered by five raps from the inside lock tender, who
proceeds to let the air out of the lock before the door can be opened by
which we go in. This door is in the top of the lock four or five feet above
our heads. As it opens a dense white fog comes out, and then up through the
fog comes the head of the man inside. We climb up a ladder and down
through a small door two feet in diameter and are inside the lock. An
incandescent electric lamp lights the place. There is a peculiar odor, rather
disagreeable, that comes up from the region beneath. It is a small place.
Standing on one side you can stretch out your hand and touch each person
in there.
The outside lock tender now pulls the door up with a block and tackle.
Air is now let in from the shaft beneath. It has the sound of escaping
steam. Almost immediately some one cries out. The air valve is quickly
closed. The pressure of the air on the drums of his ear caused a sharp
pain. He is told to work his jaws up and down or to hold his nose, close
his mouth and force the air from his lungs into his mouth, or to do the act
of swallowing. This is to open the passage from the mouth to the ear so


that the pre-sure wilt be equalized on the ear drums. After one or two
attempts the pain in his ear stops, and some more air is let into the lock.
Again there are cries from those whose ears are not kept open enough to
let the air in. Again they get relief and the air keeps coming in. After
two or three minutes the pressure has increased to twenty pounds per
square inch above the atmosphere outside, and as this is the pressure in the
shaft below and in the chamber we are "through."
A small round door now opens at our feet and as we look down, we
see two or three lights that illuminate the shaft. We go down through this
opening and on down the shaft by a ladder fixed to one side. The air feels
very damp and the ladder wet. dirty and long. We go down about 40 feet
when we pass through another door into the working chamber. There is a
steady roaring that first attracts attention. It is the repeated echos of all the
noises that occur from small streams of escaping air and from the drilling
and shoveling of the workmen. We are in a narrow low passage-way that
leads both ways from the shaft. We hear the steady blows of the hammer
as the men drill holes into the rock to hold a charge of dynamite. We
notice that we have to e&gt;ert ourselves considerably when we speak in order
to be heard, not entirely on account of the roaring, but because with an
ordinary effort one would make no noise at all. Ask one of the party to
whistle. He puckers up his lips, starts the air from his lungs as he is used
to do and no sound comes out at all. He tries again harder than before and
still no sound. Again he tries with all his might and out comes a faint
weak whistle.
We start along the chamber, now climbing over a pile of loose sand,
now wading in water where the excacation has been done below the air
pressure line, then climbing over a cross beam that braces the sides of the
chamber. Finally we come to a partition or bulkhead with a hole in it large
enough to crawl through. Every twenty or thirty feet along the chamber
is an incandescent electric lamp that shows us where we are and the way to
go. At 35 feet from the shaft we came down we turn an angle of 90 degrees
and pass through two of the bulkheads just mentioned. Here the workmen
come in sight. They are drilling holes or piling up the loose rock where
it can be gotten at readily for hoisting out, a process that will be described
later. We want to see the whole chamber, so the men stop their work' a
moment while we climb past them. Part of the way we can walk erect and
at other times have to crawl on our hands and knees.


Sixty feet from the first turn is another turn at right angles. We have
to go through some bulkheads to get by the corner. These bulkheads are
to give strength and stiffness to the caisson, the corners being points hard-
est to make strong. Just after turning the corner out of sight of the work-
men a dull thud is heard. It is the explosion of about a pound of dyna-
mite within fifty feet of us. The noise is very much deadened.
A little farther on we come to some men drilling holes into a large
"nigger-head" stone of about one cubic yard volume. It is a loose stone,
very hard, and will have to be blasted into small fragments before it can
be gotten out. The drills used are ordinary chisel drills held by one man
who gives it a slight turn after each blow given by another man.
We go on around till we come to the shaft through which we came
down. We have made the circuit around the pier a distance of 250 feet.
The climb up the ladder is more difficult than the climb down, and if one
is not very strong one is likely to have a feeling of exhaustion at this time
which would not be produced in open air with twice the amount of exer-
tion. One lives faster, the heart heats are increased, and a very noticeable
amount of exhilaration is felt.
We go up the ladder and into the lock, the door beneath is pulled up,
the outside lock tender is warned that someone is coming out, giving five
raps for an answer. The air is equalized in the lock faster than it was
when we came in. We feci the air coming out of our inner ears, and at the
same time the temperature in the lock goes down rapidly. A dense fog is
formed. As soon as the air pressure is the same as that outside the door
in the top is let down by the man outside and we climb out. The trip has
certainly been worth the trouble. Although the pressure is not half what
is sometimes used, it is enough for the first time.
The work of excavation in the chamber was carried on night and day,
the men working in three shifts of eight hours each. One of the shifts was
composed entirely of negroes. Their work in this line was very nearly as
good as that of the white men. They could not be depended on in an emer-
gency, however. They lacked nerve.
The pressure was not great enough to cause much of caisson disease
or "bends." There were only two or three cases, and they were not serious.
One negro who was getting over an attack, when asked if it hurt more than
rheumatism, said: "Oh yes! Wusser, much wusser."
The rock and coarse materials in the chamber were hoisted out in buck-
ets through supply shafts. These shafts were three in number, placed on


different sides of the caisson. They were .3 feet in diameter. The lock
used is known as the Moran lock. It is built for rapid handling of material,
ha? large openings for equalizing the air, and doors that are operated by
levers on the outside. The materials were raised or lowered in a bucket
holding about twenty cubic feet. A derrick and hoisting engine on a barge
raised and lowered the bucket. The cable was woven smooth so that by
using packing where it runs through the door of the lock it works air tight.
When the material was close by the bottom of the shaft a bucket full could
be taken otlt every five minutes.
Sometimes a method called "blowing" was resorted to to hasten the
sinking of the caisson. This was to let the air out of the chamber rapidly,
faster than the water would come in, till the pressure was reduced ten or
fifteen pounds per square inch. This could be done when the cutting edge
was down in sand or rock all the way around so the water would be held
back to a considerable extent, the result being as if a load of ten or fifteen
pounds per square inch had been suddenly added to the caisson. This
method had to be resorted to with considerable caution as there was danger
of opening up seams and joints to such a degree that the chamber would
not hold air and the writer could not be driven out again.
When the caisson was finally down into rock all around, the loose
material was all carefully cleaned out and the "sealing up" process com-
menced. That is. to fill the chamber with concrete. The concrete was
mixed outside the caisson and taken in through the Moran lock. After
filling every part of the chamber the air was kept on for a couple of days
to allow the concrete to set.
The next thing done was to fill in the space between the new caisson
and the old with concrete. This was done to a distance of about 30 feet
above the cutting edge. A solid ring of concrete now surrounded the old
caisson, tightly bound in by the new caisson.
The conclusions that were reached in regard to the leaning of the pier
were that the old caisson was not on rock all around, some parts being on
sand, possibly as much as two or three feet deep. Observations taken on
the pier with a level showed the greatest movement to take place after high
water in the river. The further conclusion was reached that this sand was
being washed out gradually and the caisson would continue to lean till it
came to a firm bearing. The new caisson with the concrete ring would put
nn effectual stop to any further washing out of this sand.


THE DRAFTING ROOM OF A BRIDGE OFFICE.
R. O. MANNING, (JO.
After completing the course of studies in engineering, there is really
only one thing lacking to start the young engineer toward success. That
one thing is opportunity. Many a successful engineer can trace his success
to the right opening that gave him a chance to start. The young engineer
is being sought after more each year, and the opportunities to get started
are on the increase.
A large number of these opportunities present themselves each year
in the drafting rooms of bridge and structural steel works. When a young
engineer secures one of these positions, he must show a disposition to learn,
work hard, and be willing to do anything. Willingness to take hold of
anything will be a large factor to rapid advancement. Too much stress
cannot be laid upon the theoretical side of the engineering course. Well
grounded theory is the foundation to practical success.
The design and building of a steel structure may be compared to that
of a frame building in which all the nails would be located and holes made
for them before putting the boards together, all the pieces of lumber would
be laid out and sawed to fit before being put in place, the difference being
that if the parts of the steel work do not fit when put together, it is not as
easy to recut and shape them as it is with the lumber. If the pieces of steel
do not fit when put together, they are often spoiled and must be thrown
away. It is often difficult to get the pieces of material to replace the
rejected parts. The material for a bridge is ordered from the rolling mills
to shape, size and length required, assuming that nothing will be spoiled,
just the same as lumber for a house is ordered from the lumber yards. The
rolling mills are often hundreds of miles from the bridge shops, while lum-
ber yards are usually jn the community in which the house is being built.
The comparison above will serve to illustrate the truth that one of the
most important requirements of the drafting room is accuracy. The most
careful and painstaking man will make mistakes, but the more nearly a per-
son's work is free from mistakes, the more it will be appreciated. Accuracy
should always have the preference over rapidity. Rapidity, or hurried
work, is almost always accompanied by a larger number of mistakes, or a
slackness of the work in one place or another. Work rushed through an


t
office without proper care and attention is almost always accompanied by a
greater loss of time in correcting mistakes in drawings while passing
through the shop than is saved in the first place, besides the expense of
correcting errors that may not be found till the work is erected. The draw-
ings and work of this kind are unsatisfactory and should be avoided as far
as possible.
The engineering force of a bridge company is usually divided into two
departments: the estimating, and the detailing.
The work of the estimating department is to prepare the estimates of
weight and cost of all work that the company bids upon, prepare all stress
sheets and preliminary plans when required, and they must secure all data
and information necessary in preparing the detail plans. Sometimes the
plans for making estimates are furnished by the parties wanting the work.
Then it is only necessary to figure the weight and estimate the cost. If no
plans are furnished, the stress sheets and preliminary plans must be worked
up from the data furnished. When plans are furnished, they are usually-
prepared by an engineer in the employ of the party wanting the work, or
by a consulting engineer who has charge of the work. The work is con-
tracted for in one x&gt;i two ways: so much per pound of shipping weight, or
so much for the work complete. The one is called a pound price, and the
other a lump sum; sometimes erected complete ready for traffic, and some-
times f. o. b. (free on board) cars at a certain place, the party buying the
material doing his own erecting.
The work of the detailing department, or what we shall hereafter desig-
nate as the drafting department, is to take the data furnished by the esti-
mating department and make the detail or shop plans. The work usually
requires from three to five times the number of men as the estimating. It
seldom occurs that a set of drawings comes into the office that can be sent
into the shop without being made over, even though they arc carefully
worked out in detail; or that a set of plans made for one bridge can be used
again even though it should be of the same length and width. Especially
is this true of railroad work, since the conditions vary so from year to year.
Specifications for material and loading are changing constantly. Ten years
ago a 100-ton engine was considered a heavy engine; today, 150-ton engines
are common in specifications. Cases where plans were used again in this
way have happened only a few times in the ten years' experience of the
writer.


A shop that turns out 6,000 to 8,000 tons of work per year requires a
drafting force of about eight, distributed about as follows: the chief drafts-
man; two men of experience who can handle any kind of work, one or both
being classed as checkers; three man to detail the bulk of the work and
sometimes doing their own tracing; two men to do tracing and who will
work into detailing. This makes a drafting force of eight, scaling up in
experience. Three years' experience in the drafting room should make
an engineer familiar with the ordinary work that comes up.
We will now take a bridge from the beginning and trace it through the
different steps until it is finished and turned over as completed to the parties
buying it. We will assume that a railroad company desires to contract for a
bridge. The chief engineer will write to the several bridge companies from
which he desires to receive bids, giving the length of span, location, speci-
fications for loading and material, and any other conditions that may gov-
ern this particular bridge, and the date of receiving bids. The estimating
department takes the data given, prepares the stress sheet, figures the weight
of the bridge, and makes an estimate of cost. The bids are received by
the railroad company, and we will suppose that the bridge company we are
considering receives the award of the contract. It is usually presumed that
the lowest bidder gets the contract, although the time of delivery and other
conditions may alter this. In the letting of public work where the plans
and specifications are definite, the lowest responsible bidder gets the con-
tract.
After the contract is secured, all the data required to get out the details
of the work are turned over to the chief of the drafting room. This data
will include the stress sheet, specifications, and a data sheet, properly filled
out, containing a list of items that usually come up in working out the
details. An order for material must first be made, and this may require
sketches of such details as are not determined by the data furnished, as
every piece of material ordered must have a place in the bridge and every
piece required must be ordered.
This material is usually inspected at the rolling mills by someone
employed by the railroad company, and must meet the requirements of the
specifications. This order for material is turned over to the person whose
business it is to place the orders with the rolling mills and furnish the
inspector with a copy of the same. It is a good plan to check the weight
of the material ordered with the estimated weight of the bridge.


After the material is ordered, the work may be laid aside until a con-
venient time comes to work up the details, unless the necessities of the case
require immediate attention. The data is then all turned over to one or
more men, as the case may require, to make the detail drawings. The chief
draftsman should go over the data with the draftsmen, making such explana-
tion that is necessary and outline the manner in which the drawings are to
be made. ' Time is saved by planning each sheet and each set of drawings
before beginning the penciling. The drawings are then penciled and traced.
On an average from two to three days are required to pencil one drawing
and less time is required to trace a drawing than to pencil it. If drawings
are to be sent for approval, they are usually sent as soon as the tracings
are finished and looked over, but before checking, in order to save time.
This assumes that the general details, sizes and dimensions are correct,
and that errors which effect the shop work alone do not concern the parties
getting the bridge, and that these errors will be corrected in checking.
The tracings, and all information, are now given to the checker, who
is supposed to check every figure on the drawings and indicate what may
be lacking on the drawings to make them complete and conform to the
requirements of the specification. It is a good plan to put a dot of red
ink under each figure as it is checked, using water proof ink so it will not
run if the tracings get damp, as they generally do when filed in a vault.
All corrections should be made with a blue pencil so as to be seen easily.
The tracings are then returned to the man who detailed the pencil draw-
ings to be corrected. All corrections should be checked by the detailer to
be svire that the corrections are correct. After corrections are all made,
the drawings, with the blue pencil marks still on them, are given back to
the checker who looks the drawings over to see that all corrections have
been properly made.
One of the duties of the drafting room is to make out a shipping bill
by which the material is shipped when the work is finished in the shop.
Every piece of finished material of the different kinds has a line in the
shipping bill, that it may be checked off and the weight placed opposite as
it is shipped.
From twelve to fifteen sets of blue-prints are made of each set of draw-
ings, distributed about as follows: six to the shop, one to the inspector, two
for approval, three for file to the parties buying the bridge, and others as
occasion may require.


The first work in the shop is to make the templates. Almost every
different piece of material is first laid out on boards, the holes bored in
their proper places, each piece marked, giving the number required, and
any other necessary information. These pieces of boards are called tem-
plates, and arc used for laying out the work on the pieces of steel by clamp-
ing or holding the templates on the pieces of steel. There are from one to
eight pieces of each kind for one span of a bridge and the templates are
used on each piece, making one template serve to lay out as many pieces as
there are of that kind. One template often serves for more than one kind,
where they differ only slightly, by properly marking the templates. Where
rivet spacing is symmetrical alxnit a center line, only one half of the length
of the piece net'd be laid out on the template. Some of the large plates
are often laid out on one of the plates itself, punched and then used as a
template, as it would be too expensive to provide the lumber on which to
lay it out.
The work then goes through the process of shearing, punching or drill-
ing, assembling, reaming if required, riveting, milling, boring, inspection,
painting shipping, and erection. A draftsman should visit the shop fre-
quently to see how the work is done and acquaint himself as much as pos-
sible with the practical side of the work.
All the work of the drafting room should 'be checked by some one other
than the person who made the original. This cannot always be done but
should be carried out as far as possible. The work of this department is
final and is so important that every precaution possible should be taken to
eliminate the errors. It usually results in a saving of time to have the work
thoroughly checked as all mistakes will be discovered before the work has
passed through the shop and is erected, and it takes a great deal more time
to look up mistakes and correct them after the work is laid aside than it
does to do it in the regular way while the work is fresh in the mind. When
it is remembered that there are hundreds of figures and relations of parts
on every drawing, and that they pass through the steps of preliminary com-
putations, transferring to the pencil drawing, and tracing, with so many
chances of misconception, it is very important to have the final work thor-
oughly checked.
The tools necessary for a draftsman in a bridge office to have are two
45° triangles, 4-in. and lo-in.; two 300 and 60° triangles, 5-in. and 13-in.;
two good right line pens: one good 42-in. T square, one that is stiff and


not loo light; one compass complete; one bow pen; one bow pencil; one
engineer's and one architect's scale; pencil and ink erasers; scratcher; and
piece of soap-stone to mb over a place in the tracing cloth that has been
scratched, to renew the surface and prevent the ink from running. Trans-
parent triangles and scales with celluloid faces are best.
A few of the practical wrinkles of the drafting room will be found in
the following:
All blue and black pencil marks are removed from the tracing with
benzine. Dampen a cloth with it and apply lo the tracing. Lay the tracing
on a newspaper, or some paper that is not wanted, before applying the
benzine, as it passes through the tracing and will spoil a pencil drawing.
Plenty of linen cloth is usually obtainable about the drafting room by wash-
ing out the tracing cloth.
An ink to make white lines on blue-prints is obtained by dissolving
soda, lime or saleratus in water, or an ink can be obtained of dealers in
draft-men's supplies. Any of these inks will run and blot the lines if the
print becomes damp.
It is the practice in some offices to pencil the work on the tracing cloth
and ink it in. In others, the penciling Is done on paper and traced. The
writer prefers the latter.
Tracing should be done on the rough side of the cloth as it is easier
to mark on that side in making corrections, changes or additions. Tracing
cloth has a tendency to roll up toward the glazed side, and when the lxjrder
is put on the drawing on the rough side it will correct this tendency to roll;
whereas, if it is put or. the glazed side, it will tend to increase it.
There should be one size of sheet for detail work, and under no cir-
cumstances should this vary as it is unnecessary and always proves a nui-
sance. Where the drawing cannot be made on one sheet, it can be made
on two or more, and sc arranged that the sheets may be pasted together
after printing. 23 x 35 inches for border lines, and 24 x 36 inches over all
is a convenient side.
Prepared ink is preferable to the stick ink which must be ground, as
it is more uniform, cheaper and cleaner.
Tracing cloth powder, which can be obtained of the dealer in small
cans ready for use, is better and causes less trouble than powdered chalk.
The natural place for the title of a shop drawing is the lower right
hand corner, the top of the title being about three and one-half inches above


the border line. If a stamp is used for all of the title except that which
describes the work on the sheet, the titles will be more uniform and will
add consideraWe to the appearance of the drawings. The title should be
made plain and prominent for ready reference in the files. It should con-
tain the contract number, sheet number, general title of the work, the special
work on that sheet, scale, date, name of detailer, tracer and checker, and
name of bridge company. In the lower right hand corner a circle three-
quarters of an inch in diameter with a horizontal line through the center,
having the number of the sheet above the line and the total number of
sheets in the set below the line, makes a convenient means of reference.
This sample of title will serve to illustrate.

The writer prefers to file the tracing flat in a drawer, one drawer con-
taining as many tracings as is convenient.
The best way to stretch tracing cloth on a drawing board is by means
of small one-half ounce tacks. The tacks are driven into and removed
from the lxjard by means of a special hammer made of ;/-inch round steel
and tempered. One end is turned over at right angles to the length so that
the end is -% of an inch from the inner face, and the other end is straight
and sharpened like a chisel. .One end is used for driving and the other for
removing the tacks. The whole is about 6J/J inches long. This hammer is


magnetized at a dynamo and will pick up the tacks so they do not need to
be handled with the fingers. Place the tracing cloth on the board and empty
a box of tacks on the tracing and tack the center of the four sides with
two tacks each, stretching the tracing tight. Then stretch the tracing by
working from the center of the sides to the corners, placing a tack every
two or three inches. The tacks that are left loose on the tracing arc taken
up with the hammer and dropped back into the box. This gives a per-
fectly smooth surface to work upon and the tacks do not interfere with the
sliding of the T square. The tacks arc removed with the chisel end of the
hammer, taking up one tack after another, the tacks all clinging to the ham-
mer and then dumped into the box. The tracing is put down and taken
up very quickly this way, and a thumb tack has not been used in this office
for sever, years.
There should be a uniform style of lettering for all shop drawings, one
that is plain and easy to read. The Reinhardt slant letter is a very good
one for this purpose.
Full, light, black lines are used for dimension lines. There is enough
contrast between the light dimension lines and the heavy lines representing
the object drawn not to confuse the drawing. The full black lines are put
on the drawing more rapidly than either dotted or red ink lines.
EDITORIALS.
We would respectfully request our readers to pay special attention to
our advertising pages. The firms represented in this issue are of the high-
est standing and it is to their patronage that the success of The Technic
is largely due.
We wish to thank our contributors for their assistance in making The
Technic and the interest they manifest for its welfare. We are pleased to
say that the writer of one of the papers, Mr. Frank M. Dunlap, was one of
the founders of the Engineering Society.
The Engineering Society has enjoyed a prosperous year. There seems
to have been a greatly increased interest in the Society, and it has been able
to pay off a considerable debt left from last year. The annual banquet this
spring was a decided success, both financially and socially. A large num-
ber were present, and an all round, general good time was enjoyed.


THE TECHNIC.
We wish to impress upon the graduate members of the Society the great
convenience they may confer by advising The Technic of any change of
address. It is almost impossible to keep the mailing list correct from year
to year. The Technic is mailed to all to whom they are due. but of course
are not received if the member has changed his address. We are often in
receipt of letters asking why The Technic has not been received, although
through no fault of ours. If any one who has changed his address will
notify the managing editor of the Technic Board, it will not only be a great
aid to the board, but will insure the prompt receipt of the Technic.
It is gratifying to know that the Mechanical Laboratory is to be con-
siderably enlarged the coming summer, and among the apparatus which is
to be placed in it is a compound marine engine, now being designed by-
some of the students, to be used in some of the courses in the recently
established department of marine engineering. The offer to become junior
professor of naval architecture has been accepted by Mr. H. C. Sadler, of
Glasgow, Scotland.

THE NEW ENGINEERING BUILDING FOR THE UNIVERSITY
OF MICHIGAN.
BY PROFESSOR DENISON.
Comparatively few persons realize the stupendous nature of the
changed and still changing conditions in the ways of living, the nature
of enterprise, and even the character of international relations,
brought about by the modern methods of scientifically applying phys-
ical forces to economic ends. Nothing less than a vast revolution has
taken place in this regard within a generation and is apparently to
continue indefinitely. Prom the smoke and dust of this onward move-
ment has from very necessity emerged the figure of the educated
engineer.
The rapidly increasing prominence assumed by the engineering
profession is one of the significant facts of our time, profoundly
affecting every phase of modern life. Its direct bearing upon grave
economic and sociological problems and its resultant effect upon the
prosperity of the state, and its consequent recognition as a prime
factor in the ultimate issue of national and racial supremacy, have
all tended in a marked degree toward a new and revised estimate of
its worth to the world.
Furthermore, a knowledge of the long years of strenuous scien-
tific and professional training now required of those who would lead


in the physical constructive realm of the world's work, together with
the honorable rewards incident to successful achievement, have
largely enhanced the newer conception of the engineer's position.
One of the notable results of this increasing public esteem for
the profession is a more than willingness on the part of governments
and of private wealth to provide liberally for the suitable and digni-
fied housing and equipment of engineering schools, where able and
earnest young men may be thoroughly trained to become, literally,
the constructors of the future.
Doubtless It is in this spirit of an enlightened comprehension of
new conditions, as well as a conviction of the imperative, immediate
wants of the engineering department, if it is in any adequate way to
fulfill its function to the state, that the Board of Regents of the Uni-
versity have unanimously entered upon a liberal policy toward the
Department. At the last meeting of the board plans by Mason &amp;
Kahn, of Detroit, were adopted and the erection of a new engineer-
ing building determined upon, which, when completed, will not only
relieve the present encumbered and congested condition, but will
form a fitting establishment and home for the Department, affording
adequate accommodations for both the faculty and students, as well
as a safe and commodious shelter for the constantly augmenting col-
lections of models, apparatus, instruments and equipment. Beyond
question this new plant, with its convenient arrangements and thor-
oughly up-to-date fittings will by the saving of time and energy alone
enormously increase the efficiency even of the present teaching force,
and in numberless ways add to the facilities for the acquisition of
knowledge, to say nothing of the actual working convenience and
comfort of the student body.
To the "old graduate" and those of the faculty who recall condi-
tions existing say twenty-five years ago, the new installation will pre-
sent some striking and most encouraging contrasts.
For many years the engineering classes occupied three or four
rooms only in the old South Wing of University Hall, rooms formerly
used for student dormitories in the earJy days. They were heated by
wood stoves stoked by the professor or an obliging student from
immense wood-boxes, daily filled by "Jimmie" Ottley,—the same
"Jimmie" long since promotod to an easy berth in the cloak-room of
the Library. The water needed for the drawing room was supplied
from a battered zinc pail, refilled from time to time as, use demanded.
It was a restricted environment,
"With creaking stair and wind-swept hall"
and old pine drawing desks "scarred by many a truant knife," but a
great deal of excellent work was done there, although under very
disadvantageous conditions and heavily discounted by the lack of
accommodations.


The new building will be in every way a notable antithesis to
these ancient quarters.
The site selected is the southeast region of the campus, inter-
sected by the beautiful " diagonal walk,'" dear to every University
habitue. The building itself will face on both South and East Uni-
versity Avenues, with a main central portion facing southeast and
northwest. An arcade 14 feet wide and 66 feet long will span the'
diagonal walk, thus preserving that favorite pathway and converting
it into a most dignified and attractive approach to the entrances of
the new structure. This central portion, with its arched portals, will
be the most conspicuous architectural feature, with a ground plan 66
x 57 feet and a total height of some 75 feet, being four stories in the
clear. From this median part extends to the west on South Univer-
sity Avenue what we will call the South Wing, 60 x 174 feet, and on
East University Avenue the East Wing, being in plan 60 x 213 feet,
with an extension to the north 22 x 100 feet for the prolongation of
the naval tank, while to the west at the north end of the East Wing
will extend a North Wing 60 x 60 feet for the steam laboratories, and
at the west end of the latter a projection 34 x 34 feet for experi-
mental work in high-pressure steam.
From this ground plan will rise a structure three and a half and
four stories high, containing one million five hundred thousand cubic
feet of space, of satisfying architectural lines, the style being that
of an adapted Renaissance, and to be erected at a cost, it is hoped, of
something less than $150,000.00.
The first story will be built of rock-faced native field stone; the rest
of a dark, reddish-brown, vitrified paving brick, while the roof is to
be of red tile. Such is a rough outline of the latest authorized addi-
tion to the architectural examples on the Campus, which, together
with the present engineering building, the engineering shops, the
laboratories and the heating and lighting plant, will form an assem-
blage of buildings for the purposes of engineering instruction quite
comparable with any in the country. Indeed, the new building in
point of size, convenience and architectural effect will, it is believed,
rank well with any three or four used for its exclusive purpose in the
United States.
Entering now, more into a detailed description of the uses of the
various parts of the building, it is well at the outset to state the fea.
tures common to each of the stories. First, all floors are to be of
concrete and expanded metal construction, thus rendering them fire-
proof and practically sound-proof as well. Through the middle of
each wing on all floors and through the central part extends a contin-
uous corridor eleven feet wide, out of which open the various lecture
rooms, recitation rooms, drawing rooms and offices. This main corri-
dor will therefore be about 400 feet long on each of the floors.
The building will contain three broad stairways all extending to
the fourth floor. Two of these will be found at the main entrances


at the right and left of the arcade and one in the west central part
of the East Wing. On all floors will be located toilet-rooms for stu-
dents and faculty and an abundant water supply. Lockers and
closets, vaults and filing-rooms for the proper and safe storage of
papers, drawings, and accumulating data.
The entire building will be warmed by direct radiation and ven-
tilated by fans or blowers delivering 2,000 cubic feet per occupant per
hour. The steam will be distributed overhead in passages or ducts
near the outside walls of the building. The returns will be carried in
'a special duct under the floor of the basement corridor.
The South, the East, and the North Wings will have separate fans.
Those for the South and East Wings will have a 7 foot running wheel
and for the North Wing a 5 foot running wheel. These fans will be
driven by direct connected electric motors.
The fresh air duct is formed by a false ceiling three feet down
from the main ceiling of the basement corridors, giving a flue of
thirty-three square feet area. From this main flue vertical flues rise
in the corridor walls throughout the entire length of the building.
The air for ventilation will be warmed to only 75 or 84 degrees and
will not be depended upon for heating the building, except in mild
weather. At the close of work in the building the ventilation may be
entirely shut off and the warmth of the building maintained by direct
radiation. This system affords the maximum economy possible with
adequate ventilation when the building is occupied.
The vent flues discharge into a large duct over the corridor, on the
fourth floor, this main duct leading to the towers of the central wing.
Separate ventilation is provided for the toilet-rooms. The tin-lined
flues from these rooms are brought together in the attic and dis-
charged through the roof by an electric-driven disc fan.
The building throughout will be provided with water service and
modern plumbing. All drawing rooms and studies will have water
service. Closets for janitors are provided on every floor in the toilet-
rooms.
With the exception of the library and faculty room, the entire
inside woodwork will be southern pine throughout.
Entering now from the southeast corner of the campus, one trav-
els over the old diagonal walk for a distance of about one hundred
feet, passing under the southeast portal into the arcade, the walls of
which are of hammer-faced, light buff, Bedford limestone. The
vaulting will be of brick with stone ribs, while the pavement under
the arch will be of colored stone and brick.
To the right and to the left are windows guarded with artistic
iron grills, to be made in the University shops. At suitable points
hammered ironwork lanterns protect electric bulbs for lighting this
public passageway at night. Turning to the right, one passes through
one of the main entrance doorways to the ground floor of the East
Wing into a broad entrance hall to one of the main stairways. Here


along the east side and projecting one hundred feet north of the
building proper, will be found the naval or ship-testing tank for the
department of naval architecture. This tank is an altogether novel
feature, it being the only entirely enclosed and protected tank for
this purpose, and therefore available in all weathers, located at any
educational institution in the world, and marks a distinct advance in
the equipment of a school for naval architecture. The University of
Michigan will therefore occupy the unique position of being the first
university to build and equip such an experimental tank. The tank
is 22 feet wide, 300 feet long and 10 feet deep, with dry dock, model
rooms, etc., attached, and a gallery running entirely around it.
Although primarily for marine investigations this tank will also be
available for the mechanical engineering department and prove
itself a most valuable adjunct to the hydraulic laboratory.
Passing the staircase at the main entrance to East Wing, on the
west side of the corridor opposite the naval tank, are first the toilet
and locker rooms, then the physical testing room and the compressed
air room. These rooms together extend the entire length on the west
side of the East Wing. The physical testing room will contain test-
ing machines for the different kinds of materials used in engineering
construction, including apparatus for testing cements, concrete and
brick.
The compressed air room will contain air compressors delivering
air at various pressures up to 3,000 pounds per square inch. These
machines are to be installed with special reference to work of inves-
tigation in connection with air at high pressures.
Passing from the East Wing into the North Wing, the first room
is the hydraulic laboratory, 32 x 56 feet, with a clear height of 14 feet.
This room is adjacent to the naval tank and contains a well 3 feet
wide and 20 feet long, connected to the bottom of the naval tank
from which a supply of water is obtained for the laboratory. The
different pumps will take their suction from this well and deliver into
a large weir tank where the water can be measured and thence
returned to the naval tank. A centrifugal pump of about 7,000,000
gallons daily capacity and a pressure pump of 1,000,000 gallons capac-
ity to work against a pressure of from 200 to 300 pounds per square
inch, will be features of this laboratory.
The south end of the hydraulic laboratory will contain one or
more ice machines for experimental work in mechanical refrigera-
tion.
The west end of the North Wing, 50 x 60 feet, will be devoted to
experimental work in steam engineering. In addition to the present
steam equipment, this laboratory will contain a special multiple
expansion engine, with cylinders arranged to secure a great variety
of expansions, with reheating receivers and other apparatus for work
with steam at unusually high pressures. The new equipment will
include steam turbines.


A sub-basement 20 x 40 feet extends along- the south side of the
steam laboratory. This will contain the weighing- tanks for weighing
water discharged from the surface condensers immediately above.
A room in the northeast corner will be used as a store room and
pipe shop in connectibn with the laboratory.
Extending to the north at the west end, is the boiler room in which
will be erected the present 35 horse-power boiler for pressures of 200
pounds per square inch, and a new 100 horse-power boiler for pressures
of 500 pounds per square inch. This new boiler will contain a super-
heater of a capacity to superheat the steam 200 degrees. The boilers
will be connected directly to the chimney in one corner, and will also
be provided with fan for induced draft. Space is provided in the
boiler room for a gas producer plant for the production of gas for fuel
purposes. A gallery 8 feet wide surrounds the boiler room, upon which
will be placed the induced draft apparatus, feed water heaters and
weighing tanks for boiler tests.
Returning to the arcade and passing into the South Wing of the
building, one finds a portion of the space devoted to the electrical
engineering department. Here are located two large electrical lab-
oratories, one for direct current for heavy machinery, the other for
alternating current for heavy machinery. Beyond these a series of
rooms for research work, a calibration room, a photometry room for
measurements on electric lamps, and a storage battery room.
Passing up to the second floor by one of the central stairways,
which are situated in towers projecting from the northwest front of
the main building, one comes to the second floor. On this floor imme-
diately over the arcade and occupying the central portion, is located
a beautiful room designated as the library. This apartment is 30 x 54
feet and is a feature of the building upon which the entire faculty
united as most desirable. It will be wholly for the use of engineering
students, where they can meet each other, read or study, and profit-
ably pass the time intervening between lectures and other engage-
ments. Three large windows face directly southeast and overlook
the diagonal walk in that direction. At either end of the room will
be large eight-foot fire places. Permanent seats in corners and tables
and book alcoves, and such other furnishings as will make the room an
attactive meeting place. The ceiling will be deep overhead open
beam construction, the room finished in oak, with high wainscotting
and red tile floor, all of which will give the room something of a scho-
lastic atmosphere and tone.
Directly across the corridor, but still immediately over the arch-
way will be the faculty room and secretary's office, these rooms, look-
ing northwest and commanding an extended view clear across the
campus by way of the diagonal walk.
The east side of the East Wing proper contains instructors' rooms,
file rooms and two class rooms. The west side contains laboratory
rooms for research work, and a room for compressed air work over the


compressed air room in the basement, a fan room for ventilating pur-
poses, and an instrument room. The north end of this wing contains
a computing room and an instructor's room adjacent to it. A room
20 x 36 feet immediately above the hydraulic laboratory in the base-
ment, will contain a large open tank holding about 4,000 gallons and a
closed tank for high pressure work. Apparatus will also be provided
in this room for experimental investigation of the flow of water
through nozzles and the action of water upon various shaped vanes,
including several types of water motors. The open tank will have a
flume leading to the basement, supplying water to a turbine wheel,
discharging into the wier tank previously mentioned. The location of
the open tank affords a head of about 20 feet.
A room 19 x 25 feet, immediately above the ice machines in the
basement, will be devoted to cold storage purposes. Three cold stor-
age chambers will occupy one side of this room, in which desired tem-
peratures may be maintained. One side of the room will be given to
the cooling coils required, in connection with the refrigerating
machines.
Adjacent to the cold storage room on the west, is a small room
for testing machines, with which building materials which have been
exposed to very low temperature may be tested.
The entire floor of the west end of the North Wing will be devoted
to general laboratory purposes, including a room for gas and hot air
engines, a calibration room, a room for the analysis of fuels and fur-
nace gases, and a room for the analysis and testing of lubricants.
The gallery of the boiler room is on a level with and accessible
from this floor.
A space 20 x 40 feet will be devoted to rope and belt drives and
other machinery of transmission.
The South Wing on this second floor will contain the office of the
Dean, lecture and recitation rooms and model room for the depart-
ment of civil engineering. Also two large recitation rooms and a
drawing room for the department of electrical engineering.
On the third floor, starting again from the main stairway in the
East Wing, the east side contains a recitation room with adjacent
study and drawing room 22 feet wide by 90 feet long. On the opposite
side of the corridor are rooms for recitation, for advanced drawing,
for a catalogue file, and for instructors.
With the exception of one room, the entire North Wing will be
devoted to naval architecture and marine engineering. Besides a
class room, a model room and a drawing room, there will be a mold
loft 35 x 60 feet for the laying down of ship lines full size, and for other
practical work of the ship yard, including steaming vat and bending
floor for light wood construction.
One room on this floor will contain special apparatus for experi-
mental work on fans and radiators.
In the central portion of the building on this third floor will be
4


found a large lecture room of the same size and immediately over the
library, also a recitation room across the corridor. In the South
Wing will be located a large drawing room, a recitation and lecture
room, an instrument room and photographic dark room, and office for
the professor of geodesy and surveying.
The fourth floor is devoted entirely to the work in stereotomy,
mechanism and drawing. In the central portion of the building will
be a large lecture room and office, separated by the usual corridor and
corresponding in size to the room below. In the East and South Wings
will be three large drawing rooms and one smaller drawing room.
These rooms will receive their light from one directon only, that is,
from a glass partition, lighted by an immense skylight situated over
the corridor. The corridors themselves will all be brightly lighted
from above and are especially adapted for the exhibition of drawings
on their wall space. In addition to the above there are four class
rooms. Thus, all the work in this department will be conducted on
one floor, a specially economical and convenient arrangement.
From this outline sketch of the new building it will be seen that
the Engineering Department may expect soon to be in possession of
a building which will be a credit to the University and a distinct and
valuable addition to the public property of the state: A building in
which the people may well take a reasonable pride, and it is certainly
to be hoped that they will avail themselves of all the opportunities it
affords.


DYNAMICS OF RECIPROCATING ENGINES.
BY M. E. COOLEY.
The problem of the forces which exist in reciprocating engines
has many points of interest not usually considered by engineers. It
is customary to consider that the pressure on the piston is transmitted
unchanged, or only slightly modified by the angularity of the
connecting-rod, to the crank-pin, and the moving parts are designed
with reference to this pressure.
It is the purpose of this paper to consider the forces to which the
crank-pin is subjected, and to show graphically the effect of the angu-
larity of the connecting-rod and of the acceleration of the recipro-
cating parts, viz: the piston, piston-rod, cross-head, and the unbal-
anced part of the connecting-rod. The discussion will be confined to
horizontal engines, and the effect of friction will be neglected as it is
such a variable quantity. The application to vertical engines may be
easily made when the action of the horizontal engine is fully under-
stood. The problem will be treated by considering
First, The effort in the connecting-rod, and its effect in producing
rotation of the crank.
Second, The pressure required to accelerate the reciprocating
parts, and the resultant effort producing rotation of the crank.
Third, The variation in rotational effort for which the fly-wheel is
provided.
First, Tlw Connecting-rod Effort and the Rotational Effort.—It will be
simpler to consider, first, an engine in which the connection between
the piston and crank is straight, that is, a yoke or slot connection in-
stead of a connecting-rod. Later the first will be spoken of as an
infinite connecting-rod and the later as a. finite connecting-rod.
With the yoke connection the pressures on the piston are trans-
mitted in parallel lines for all positions of the crank.
In Pig. 1, let 0 be the center of the circle described in the crank-
pin C, and OC any position of the crank making an angle 9 with the
line of the centres. The diameter of the circle, A' B' is equal to,
and for our purpose will represent, the stroke of the piston. Let
Pi = the effort on the piston acting on the crank-pin in the line Y G.
Pi may be resolved into two forces, R C acting radially, and C T
acting tangentially. The second produces rotation, and will be re-
ferred to as the tangential effort; the first produces friction only and is
lost so far as turning the engine is concerned.
(•Revised from Techkic, 1888.)


If Pi is taken to a scale, then the values of tangential and radial
efforts may be measured directly.
It is more convenient, however, to determine the tangential effort
1 V

Fig. 1.
by taking from the center O a perpendicular OM upon the line of
action of the force Pi produced.
Denoting the tangential effort by 1\ and the radius of the circle
by r, and taking moments about 0, we have
Ti-r
whence Ti
Pi- OM.
Pi-Ulr
r
If r be taken to a scale = Pi, then I\ — 0 M. Taking Cc perpen-
dicular to A' 11', we have 1\ = O M= Cc — r sine 6 (j)- or the
tangential effort is represented by the sine of the crank angle, and is
equal to it when Pi = r.
If now the case of a connecting-rod is considered, let II 0 repre-
sent the line of action of the force, making an angle a and with the
line of centres. Produce II tl and from 0 drop upon it the perpen-
lar 0 N. Let I't and Tt denote the connecting-rod and the tangentia'
efforts respectively, then as before
Tt -r = PtON (4).
I't ■ cTx
whence
Tt
.(6).
and if r be taken = Pt, then Tt — 0 N.
As will be seen the connecting-rod has the effect of increasing the
tangential efforts in the first and fourth quadrants, and of decreasing
these efforts in the second and third quadrants.
The value of Pt may be found by multiplying by the secant of
the angle «, or Pt = Pi sec o (G).


For usual ratios of connecting-rod length to crank the value of
Pt is from 1.015 Pi to 1.03 Pi when the connecting-rod and crank are
at right angles, being of course equal to Pi at the ends of the stroke.
It is unimportant to consider this difference in practice except
when the connecting-rod is short relatively to the crank. It may
then be useful to know the efforts in the rod for each position of the
crank, and these efforts may be found graphically as follows:

Fig. 2.
In Fig. 2 let A B C D represent an indicator diagram from an
engine in which the steam follows full stroke, and A B C ef, one from
an engine cutting off at e.
Let h be the position of the piston, h c the connecting-rod and c
the crank-pin, describing the crank circle on the diameter A' B'.
The ordinate h p represents the pressure against the piston for the
assumed position. Produce h p and erect j I perpendicular to the
connecting-rod, intersecting h p produced in I. Take j k — It p and
draw k p' parallel to h c; then hp' will represent, to the same scale
as h p, the effort in the connecting-rod. For, taking moments about
I we have
7/i
Pi • Ih = Pt ■ Ij, whence Pt = Pi' —... .(7):
lj
Ih hp' hp' hp'
by similar triangles — = — = —; or, Pt = Pi — (8).
lj Jk hp , hp
But Pi = hp, therefore Pt — hp'. In the same way for the pressure
hq against the piston, the pressure /('/' exists in the connecting-rod.
The dotted diagrams represent the indicator diagrams as modified by
the connecting-rod. As before stated this calculation may be
neglected except in extreme cases.
Having now a simple method of finding the tangential efforts for
each position of the crank and corresponding position of the piston,


it becomes easy to show by a diagram the tangential efforts for an
entire revolution.*
In Pig. 3 let the upper part represent indicator diagrams in which
A B is the stroke, A C D B A, a diagram following full stroke, and
A G E F B A, a diagram following part stroke. Consider first the
diagrams shown by full lines. Divide the diagram into the usual ten
equal spaces and erect in the middle of the spaces the ordinates
numbered from 1 to 10. Each ordinate will represent the pressure
against the piston for the space in which it stands, and the average
of these ordinates will of course represent the average pressure
against the piston for an entire stroke. On the diameter A' B' — A B,
describe the crank circle, and project the ordinates as shown, cutting
A' B', also the circumference, in the points numbered from 1 to 10.
Through these latter points of division draw the radial lines «, tx,
Si h s10 t10. With a radius Os = A C — the uniform pressure for the
stroke diagram, describe the semi-circle 8, sa s10. This last circle
is called the radial diagram of %&gt;ressures for full stroke. It amounts,
of course, to taking the ordinates from the indicator diagram and
laying them off from the centre O on the radial lines which, to avoid
confusion, have not been drawn from the centre to the circle s, .*, &amp;c;
that is, Os^ Osi &amp;c, are taken equal to ordinates 1, 2 &amp;c, of the
indicator dingram.
If from the points s, ,&lt;t2 s3 &amp;c, perpendiculars be dropped upon the
line of centres A' B', these perpendiculars will, as already shown,
represent the tangential efforts for the corresponding crank positions
with an indefinite connecting-rod.
Now take these perpendiculars and lay them off outside the crank
circle, considered as a base circle; that is, take It,. A?, .U3 10tl0,
equal respectively to the perpendiculars upon A' B' from s,, n2 s10,
and connect the extremities by the curve A' t, U tw B'\ this line is
known as the curve of tangential efforts, and shows at a glance the turn-
ing effort for all positions of the crank from the beginning to the end
of one stroke. The curve for the return stroke with an infinite con-
necting-rod [not shown] would be identical with that for the forward
stroke.
Considering the diagram in which steam follows with full pressure
through CE and expands through EF, the radial diagram becomes

and laid off as before give the tangential diagram A' t, U t3ttt'6t'e

Fig. 3.


The indicator diagrams thus far considered are ideal, and are
never fully realized in practice. The dotted diagram shown for the
return stroke is modified to represent more closely actual practice,
the corners at e, /, g and lib being rounded for practical reasons; the
back-pressure line gu lies above Ali by an amount equal to the back-
pressure. It will be evident that as steam pushes the piston on one
side with a pressure varying, as shown by the line c e f g, the piston
pushes or expels the steam from the cylinder on the other side with a
pressure varying, as shown by the line ahh' b'; therefore, the useful
pressure will be the difference between the ordinates of these lines,
becoming negative where they cross at /. In the lower half of the
crank circle, then, construct the radial diagram $l0 .s„ .&lt;, by taking
the difference of these pressures. Where the expansion line eg
crosses the compression line h'b', the pressures on the two sides of the
piston are equal, and the radial diagram passes through the center O.
Prom this point to the end of the stroke the back pressure is greater
than the forward pressure, and the radial diagram continues as shown.
By erecting the perpendiculars and laying off outside of the base
circle, as before, we get the tangential diagram Ii' tl0 t, ti A'.
Between U and t, it passes inside the base circle, showing that instead
of a rotational effort driving the crank, the crank drives or pulls the
piston. The diagram, then, shows at a glance the effect of efforts on
the piston in turning the crank; and all being constructed to a scale,
quantities may be measured with as much accuracy as the original
indicator diagrams.
If preferred a straight line may be used instead of the base
circle, the tangential efforts being laid off on ordinates spaced the
same as on the circle, at right angles to the base line.
The mean tangential effort may be found by dividing the tangen-
tial diagram into equal spaces on the base circle, drawing radial
ordinates, and averaging the same as the indicator diagram; or it
may be found as follows: The useful work done on the piston is of
course equal to the useful work done on the crank-pin. While the
piston travels the length of its stroke A Ii, the crank-pin travels the
length of the semicircle on A' Ii'.
This latter length = A'B' — -AB— = 1.5708 A B.... (9).
2 2
Let p equal the mean effective pressure per sq. inch against the
piston for a stroke, found by averaging the ordinates of the indicator
diagram and multiplying by the scale of the diagram, and (, the
tangential effort corresponding to p, then
P
p ■ A B - 1.57 A Ii ■ t whence t = — (10).
1.57


'5
The total mean effective pressure and the total mean tangential
effort will of course be found by multiplying p and ( by the area of
the piston.
The value of t may be laid off from the base circle to the proper
scale and a circle drawn through it from centre O; this circle is
called the circle of mean tangential effort. FigB. ft, 13 and 15 show these
circles. The variations outside and inside of this circle should be
small to give uniform speed with a light fly-wheel.
In Fig. 4 the tangential diagrams of Fig. 3 are reproduced in dot
and dash line and the full line shows the effect of considering the

Fig.-4.


angularity of the connecting-rod. The construction is as follows:
C\l, Ci2, CaS C\010 are positions of the connecting-rod cor-
responding to the crank positions 1, S, 3 10, C represents a point on
the radial diagram as in Fig. 3; through Cdraw C A parallel to the
corresponding crank position, from the center B let fall a perpen-
dicular on 0 A. This perpendicular, as already shown, will he equal
to the tangential efforts. The following construction gives less
confusion; from the point 1 draw the radius 1S, equal to the
pressure of the piston and equal to CB. From the point S let fall
perpendicular on the connecting-rod position C, 1 cutting it in O,.
Now since the two triangles ACB and lS^x have two sides parallel
and one side equal, the other sides are equal, hence AB equals iS',0,
equals the tangential effort. In a similar manner we find the tan-
gential efforts S202, SsOa, SiOt S10O10. These tangential
efforts are laid off from the base circle giving the curve t,, U, V .. .t10.
In the diagrams that follow the piston pressures have been laid off
from the centers of the crank circles. The same construction fol-
lows for the return stroke shown in the lower half of the circle.
Thus far only a single engine has been considered; but the same
construction may be applied to an engine with any number of cylin-
ders, care being taken to reduce all of the diagrams to the same
scale before combining, considering not only the scale of the indi-
cator diagrams, but also the relative sizes of the cylinders. For
. example, take a two-cylinder compound engine with the condensing
cylinder twice the volume of the non-condensing cylinder. Let the
scale of the indicator diagram from the first be 20 lbs. to the inch,
and from the latter, 60 lbs. to the inch; then the tangential efforts of-
the non-condensing cylinder will need to be multipled by the fraction
3-2 in order to reduce both to the condensing cylinder. Thus the area
of condensing cylinder X combined tangential ordinate will equal
total turning effort. This may be conveniently done by the use of
proportional dividers. In referring the tangential diagram to a
common base circle preparatory to combining, care should be taken
that no error be made in the relative positions of the diagrams.
Fig. 5 shows a pair of diagrams worked up for the U. S. S. Quinne-
baug.
These engines are two-cylinder compound, the dimensions being
42 ins. and 64 ins. diameter, and 42 ins. stroke. The condensing
cylinder is 90° ahead of, or 270° behind, the non-condensing cylinder.
The diagrams represent the engines doing 1102 I. H. P., or 590
for the non-condensing, and 512 for the condensing cylinder; 61
revolutions were made per minute, with a boiler pressure of 78 lbs. per
sq. in., and a vacuum of 19 ins. The scales of the diagrams were 40
and 20 lbs. to the inch, but as they have been reduced to two-thirds
full size, the scales have been marked 60 and 30 lbs. to the inch. The
circular and tangential diagrams were made separately and then
combined, as shown in the figure. Light full lines indicate the non-


17
condensing', and dotted lines, the condensing cylinder diagrams, the
heavy full line the combined diagram. The circles of mean tangen-

Fig. 5.


tial efforts are marked as shown. The hatched portions outside and
inside of the combined mean tangential effort circle show the varia-
tion of the tangential efforts. The diagram will be clear without
further explanation, and it will be apparent that the maximum tan-
gential effort for which the shaft and crank must be designed may be
easily located, and measured with accuracy. Frequently, surprising
irregularities are found by the use of the diagrams as explained; but
more surprising will the irregularities be found when the effect of
acceleration is considered.
Second, The Efforts as Affected by Acceleration of the Reciprocating
Parts.—Thus far only the tangential efforts have been considered, and
these unaffected by disturbing influences other than those due to the
angularity of the connecting-rod. We will next consider the effects
of acceleration and retardation of the reciprocating parts.
As before, first consider an engine with an infinite connecting-rod,
and in Fig. (i let O be the center of a crank circle described on A' B'
as a diameter. Take the crank OC,
making any angle 0 with A'B', and draw
YC and CY to represent direction of
piston and tangential efforts respec-
tively. Erect the perpendiculars VM
and Cc. Let Y = velocity of crank-pin,
A '—*» 0 Bf and v — velocity of piston. This is, then,
Fig. 6. a case of simple 'harmonic motion. If
Y=CV= uniform tangential velocity of crank-pin, CM = V sin
0 = v = variable velocity of piston; and if r be taken equal to V,
then Cc — CM = v. If v = CM = V sin e = velocity of piston,
dv (IS dQ V

accelerations corresponding to the different crank positions; if the

practice it is more convenient to reduce this weight to the equivalent
W
weight per square inch of piston area, or w = —, where A = area of
A
piston. In ordinary cases the value of w varies from 2.5 lbs. to 5 or
6 lbs. As an example take an engine 10 ins. diameter, and 12 ins.
stroke, making 300 revolutions per minute, with a value of w = 3 lbs.

pressure of 45.9 lbs. per sq. inch is required to start the reciprocating
parts from rest, assuming no friction; and an equivalent pressure is
given out at the end of the stroke.
If to = 2 lbs., the pressure for acceleration becomes % X 45.9 = 30.6
lbs. per sq. inch. If the revolutions are 200, the pressure becomes
(188)* X 45.9 = 20.4 lbs. per sq. inch, and with 100 revolutions the
pressure becomes VMf X 45.9 — 5.1 lbs. per sq. inch.
,, In Fig. 8 let A CD B A
be indicator diagram fol-
lowing full stroke. Take
C a equal to the pressure
required for acceleration
at the beginning of the
stroke = I) b the equiva-
lent pressure due to re-
tardation at the end of the
stroke. Draw a b cutting
O D in O. Then the effec-
tive pressure against the
piston at the beginning of
the stroke is AC— G a —
A a, and at the end of the
stroke, BD + Db = Bb,
while at the middle of
the stroke it remains .un-
changed. During the first
half of the stroke work
represented by the trian-
GO a has been done on the
reciprocating parts by accelerating them, and during the second half,
work represented by the equal triangle T) 0 b has been done by the
reciprocating parts in retarding them, the total work remaining
unchanged.
With a higher speed let C a' = I) b' = the pressure for accelera-
tion and retardation. Then at the beginning of the stroke there is
no effective pressure against the piston, and at the end the pressure


is twice as great as the indicator diagram shows. Any increase of
speed beyond this point gives a negative pressure at the beginning of
the stroke, as shown by the line a" b". From A to c there is a pull on
the reciprocating parts by the crank, this pull changing to a push by
the steam after passing c. Attention need now scarcely be drawn to
the fact that the pressure for which the moving parts of engines are
usually designed may be far from the correct pressure. It is also
evident that in general the reciprocating parts should be made as
light as is consistent with strength, and the number of revolutions
should not be increased unduly. An engine that runs quietly and
smoothly at one speed may be noisy and give trouble at a different
speed.
With slow speed engines, and with engines having relatively long
connecting-rods, the solution given is sufficiently exact for practical
purposes; but with high speed engines, and with engines having rela-
tively short connecting-rods, the following solution becomes necessary.
Consider an engine with a,finite connecting-rod
FIG. 9.
and in Fig. 9 take the crank circle as before, and draw the connecting-
rod HO, producing it to M. Draw VM perpendicular to HM, and cC
and ON perpendicular to A ' IV. Let A II be the stroke of the
eagine, and let the piston be at JET. Let 1'= CV — the tangential
velocity of the crank-pin, and v = velocity of piston or cross-head,
a = angle 'made by connecting-rod with line of centres, B — crank
angle, + = OCM= OVM. Denote the lengths of connecting-rod and
crank by I and r respectively.
While the crank has moved from A' to C through the angle O, the
piston has moved from A to IT. The ratio of the velocity of the
piston l) to the velocity of the crank-pin V may be found by projecting
each velocity upon the dirction of the connecting-rod, which, being
a rigid body, must contain equal components of the velocities in the
direction of its length. Therfore
v cos a — V sin + {IS).
HC sin a = I sin a = r sin 9,
r
Whence, sin a = — sin 6, and cos o = \ 1 sin 26 (l/i).


THE TECHNIC.
But * = a + e&gt; therefore, sin * = sin a cos 6 + cos a sin 8 (15).
Substituting the values of sin a and cos a from (14), we have
sin * = — sin 9 cos 6+

Comparing this with the equation for the relative velocities with

expressed with only the crank angle as a variable.

value of Au is J larger, and that of lib J smaller than with the in-
finite rod, while the acceleration line crosses A B at a point distant
from O by very nearly l of the acceleration for an infinite rod. For
the return stroke we have the line b' a'.
The following graphical solution of the equation will be found
very convenient, and nearly exact:

the horizontals as shown. In the case of the infinite rod, the accele-
ration efforts are measured from the circumference of the circle to

In Fig. 11 indicator diagrams are shown, one in full lines, the other
dotted, with the acceleration lines for both the infinite and the finite
rod. For convenience, these lines are drawn with reference to the
lower line of the diagram. The portions of the diagram between
these lines and the upper line of the diagram show the effective
pressures against the piston in the two cases. The effect of the finite
rod is to lessen the effective pressure on the piston at the beginning
and end of one stroke, increasing it in the middle, and vice versa for
the return stroke. For still greater clearness the effective pressures
are laid off with reference to a base line At JJ, where by full lines and
by dotted lines they are shown, the arrow heads denoting direction of
piston's motion. The difference is very marked.
Fig. 12 shows the effect of acceleration with
high speed. The effective
pressures are laid off with
reference to A li. There
is a slight pressure driving
piston from A to d, a neg-
ative effort to pull from d
to e, and a positive effort
from e to the end of stroke.
The changes at d and e
sometimes cause a pecu-
liar noise, if the bearings
are at all worn, which the
engineer is often at a loss
to account for. With in-
creased load and longer
cut-off the noise disap- , ,
pears. Automatic engines
starting without load frequently pound for this reason.

The indicator diagrams in Fig. 13 were taken when the engine
was running empty. The revolutions were 240 per minute. A is the
head end, and B the crank end. The spring used was 40 lbs. to the

the scale is marked 60 lbs. to the inch: The pressure per sq. inch to

51
to start the reciprocating parts from rest, and 37.51 — 5.88 = 31.63
lbs. to bring them to rest again at the. end of the stroke. The
pressure for the crank end diagram would be a little greater as the
area of the piston-rod decreases the area of the piston; but it may
without serious error be considered the same. A circle may now be
•described with a radius = 37.51 lbs. to a scale of 60 lbs. to the inch, as
in Fig. 10, and the points d, o, e found by taking Oo = Dd = Ee — 5.88
lbs. to the same scale, and describing the arc of the circle d o e. The
diameter and circumference being divided the same as the indicator
■diagram, the horizontals may be drawn and the distances A' o , c, pl..
CioPio, B' o transferred and laid off on the ordinates (not drawn)
from the line C D. A comparison of the forward pressure line of
the diagram E, of the back pressure line of E', and of the accelera-
tion line a b, gives us the line of effective piston efforts r s t u,
referred to the line A B. For the return stroke, in the same way,
may be found the line r' s V u'. On both strokes the piston efforts
become negative at the points t and V. The ordinates of the lines
rstu and r' s V u' may now be transferred to the lower figure giving
the radial diagrams s s, s6 O s, .ia and s0 stO s* sb for the forward and
return strokes respectively. From these radial diagrams the tangen-
tial diagrams A' M Q N B' and B' N' P M' A' are found. The mean
tangential effort circle may be found by formula, or by averaging
ordinates, as already explained. An inspection of the figures shows
a positive turning effort from A' to N, and a negative turning effort from
NtoB'. On the return stroke it is positive from B' to M! and nega-
tive from M' to A'.

Figs. 14 and 15 show results for the engine under normal load
making 235 revolutions per minute. In Fig. 14 the acceleration lines
are referred to A B, and the lines of effective piston efforts to a line
below (not lettered). The radial diagrams of effective piston efforts,
and the tangential diagrams in Fig. 15 will be clear from previous
constructions.

The mean effective pressure found by averaging the two indicator
diagrams is 26.94 lbs.; and this multiplied by twice the stroke equals
the work dohe in one revolution by one sq. inch of piston area, and it
also equals the work done in one revolution on the crank-pin; or
-— 26.94

for the mean tangential effort. This quantity laid off to the scale of 60

lbs. from the base circle gives the dot and dash mean tangential effort
circle shown in Fig. 15.

Fig. 15.
Third, Fly-Wlwelx.—The relation of the work already done to the
computation for the fly-wheel is very simple. The object of the fly-
wheel is to regulate speed, and it accomplishes this object by taking
up, or absorbing, the surplus energy in one part of a revolution and
giving it out again in another part where there is a deficiency, this
being accomplished by a change of speed. For instance, in Fig. 15,
from Mto N, or through 99° there is an excess of power as shown by
the irregular figure MQN; from j\rto N', or through 80.5°, there is a
deficiency of power, or excess of resistance, as shown by the figure
Nil' N'. Again there is an excess of power from N' M' through 90°,
and a deficiency from 31' to M through 90.5°.
These excesses and deficiencies may be reduced to foot-pounds as
follows: The average excess of tangential effort from M to N is 15


99
lbs. The angle is —■ X 2 »r = 1.73, and the crank radius is % of a foot;-
360
therefore the excess is 15 X 1.73 X 0.67 = 17.3 ft.-lbs. per sq. inch.
In the same way we may find the excess or deficiency for other
fractions of the revolution, when all may be grouped in a table as
follows:
Power. Resistance.
I. Excess through 99° 17.30
II. Deficiency" 80.5° 11.80
III. Excess " 90° 9.06
IV. Deficiency" 90.5° 14.54
26.36 26.34
2
The work for one revolution is equal to 17.16 X2^X — = 71.91
3
ft. lbs. per sq. inch. Therefore, the excess of power, or of resistance,
26.35
in one revolution is = 0.366 of the whole energy; and this fluctu-
71.91
ation must be provided for by the fly-wheel. It is customary, however,
to provide a fly-wheel that will care for the maximum fluctuation of
energy, and this will of course give lesser variations of speed for the
lesser fluctuations of energy.
For instance, during the fractions of the revolution numbered I
and II, the excess of power is 17.30 ft. lbs. and the total energy per sq.
71.91
inch of piston for that portion of a revolution is = 35.95 ft. lbs.;
2
17.30
therefore, the excess of power for one-half revolution is = 0.481
35.95
of the total energy for one-half revolution. To design the fly-wheel
for this fluctuation will give closer regulation in other parts of the
revolution. The area of the piston equals 95 sq. inches, and 95 X 17.30-
= 1643.5 ft. lbs. for the total excess, which we will call A E.
In practice we may consider the rim of the fly-wheel as the
governing weight, neglecting the arms and hub.
If, then, a fly-wheel rim of weight W change in velocity from Vl
to V'i ft. per second, the energy represented by the change will equal
w w
— (Vi'-rl') = -(V,+ F1)(r!-F,) = AB. ButF2+ F, = «F=
eg 29
twice the mean velocity, and Fa — Vi — the difference between the
V 2g A E mg A E
greatest and least velocity = —; therefore W~ = , the
m V V
srx-
usual Rankine formula. m


The outside diameter of the fly-wheels of the engine under con-
sideration is 5 feet. Assume the mean diameter = 4.75 feet. The
engine is intended to run at from 180 to 235 revolutions per minute. In
our calculation assume 180 revolutions; then the mean velocity V =
180 X 4.75 X 3.1416
= 44.77 feet per second. The coefficient m may vary
60
from 25 to 100 or more. Assume it equal to 80, then
80X32.2X1643.5
W = = 2113 lbs.
(44.7612
This weight is that needed to control the engine against its own vari-
ations of load. The fly-wheels together weigh about 4000 lbs., which
enables the engine to care for a considerable variation of external
load. Fly-wheels should, however, be placed as near the variable
load as possible. Between full load and the friction load the engine
varied from 235 to 240 revolutions per minute. But this change of
speed was not due to fluctuation of energy, but simply to the fact
that an increase of speed was necessary to throw the governor
weights out far enough to control the valve for the new point of cut-
off. The diagram for the fly-wheel ma3r, if preferred, be constructed
with reference to a straight base line of length equal to the circum-
ference of the base circle, the same as suggested for tangential
efforts, but the method presented is convenient, and gives the designer
a more perfect idea of the points in the revolution where the varia-
tions occur. M. E. Cooley.

THE RIVER AND HARBOR WORKS AND THE CIVIL
ENGINEER.
HENRY CLAY RIPLEY, '70, MEM. AM. SOC. C. E.
There is probably no appropriation bill passed by Congress that
has greater interest for the public in general than that for the
improvement of our river and harbors.
The present Rivers and Harbors bill which has just passed the
senate, carries an aggregate of about $70,000,000. The bill of the
last congress aggregated more than $60,000,000 and, since a bill is
passed on an average once in two years, the annual expenditure for
river and harbor work is in the neighborhood of $30,000,000. This
immense sum is being expended annually upon works of a purely
civil nature, works in which the civil engineers of this country are
eminently qualified both by education and experience to execute, and
yet it may truthfully be said that, as a class, the civil engineers
take less interest in these appropriations than does the general
public.
It is difficult to understand that such a condition can exist and
it is believed that it can only be accounted for by the fact that the
civil engineers do not appreciate the fruitful field that would be
open to them professionally, and the great benefit and economy that
would result to the government by the inauguration of a different
state of affairs from that which now exists.
A brief acount of the policy under which these works are con-
ducted and some of the efforts which have been made to remedy its
defects will lead to a clearer understanding of the situation and will
pave the way to the intelligent consideration of some suggestions
which it is purposed to make.
Under the present policy the law provides that the money appro-
priated for the works shall be expended under the direction of the
Secretary of War anH the supervision of the Chief of Kngineers of
the Army. The law also provides that the work shall be done by con-
tract, awarded to the lowest responsible bidder after due advertise-
ment, except in a few cases where a deviation from this regulation
is permitted.
The conduct of the work is, therefore, under military rule and
the regulations are those adapted to the military service. While it is
true that there is a considerable number of civil engineers engaged
on these works: they occupy subordinate positions and can only
attain to the rank of assistant engineer and under no circumstances,
no matter what qualifications they may possess, can they succeed to
independent charge of work.


Although the present policy of conducting1 these works, with
some modifications from time to time, has been in operation for
upwards of thirty-five years the results are far from satisfactory. It
has been contended that a military organization is not the best for
the conduct of work of a purely civil nature, that the best results
are never attained unless promotions are made on account of merit
rather than from seniority, that authority in many instances stifles
investigation and that science is subordinate to rank. For these and
many other reasons, which it is not necessary here to enumerate, it
was contended that there should be a reorganization of the public
works and their establishment on a civil basis. This contention
culminated about fifteen years ago in the introduction of a measure
in both branches of congress, known as the Cullom-Breckenridge
bill. The discussion of this measure fully set forth the defects of
the present system, but the remedy proposed was not sufficiently
satisfactory to gain the support of a majority of congress and the
bill never came to a vote. Naturally this bill was opposed by the
Corps of Engineers but some of its provisions were afterwards
adopted by it and the Division Engineer and the continuing contract
system are outgrowths of this agitation.
At one time these works were largely carried on by hired labor
and the purchase of material in open market. The contractors of
the country, however, were not slow in realizing the disadvantage of
such a system to their business and they immediately took step9 to
■demonstrate to Congress the advantage of open competition in these
public works the same as there was in private and corporate work.
The Corps of Engineers at first opposed this innovation but Congress
was insistent and the principle of open competition became estab-
lished in the regulations, to the great economy of the works, and the
worthy contractor is today regarded by the Engineer officer as a
necessary adjunct to efficient results.
It has been evident for many years to military as well as civil
engineers and others familiar with these public works that immense
sums of money were being wasted and the improvement of our impor-
tant rivers and harbors were being indefinitely postponed by the adop-
tion of plans not calculated to produce the best results. As early as
1873 Mr. Eads saw a threatened danger to the commerce of the Missis-
sippi river by the construction of what was known as the proposed Fort
St. Philip Canal at an estimated cost of about $15,000,000. He denied
both the necessity and wisdom of the plan, and discussed the subject
both in the public prints and before the committees of Congress.
He finally made a proposition to the government to secure a better
outlet by an open river mouth at South West Pass for a sum of money
only two-thirds as great as the estimated cost of the canal, and pay-
ments were to be made only upon the securing 'Of results. This
proposition was vigorously and even bitterly opposed by many mem-
bers of the Corps of Engineers, including the chief, with the result
.-


that a compromise was finally effected by which Mr. Eads accepted'
a contract from the government to improve South Pass instead of
South West Pass, for the sum of $5,250,000 for a channel 26 feet deep
and 200 feet wide, and he agreed to maintain this channel for twenty
years for the additional sum of $100,000 annually. This work was
completed in five years and the channel was maintained for twenty
years, greatly to the benefit of commerce and the advantage of the
government.
This contract with Mr. Eads was regarded by the army engineers-
as an innovation upon the rights and prerogative of their corps and
at first some considerable friction was developed between the Chief
of Engineers and Mr. Eads which resulted in the Chief of Engineers
being relieved from all control of the inspection of that work. This
duty, however, was restored to his successors and no further trouble
was experienced.
Under the River and Harbor Acts of 1894 and 1896, Mr. C. P. Good-
year, a lawyer, was authorized to deepen the outer Bar of Brunswick,
Ga., by a method of his own, for a sum of money,depending on the results
secured, aggregating less than 10 per cent, of the estimated cost of
the approved plan; which latter consisted of two long jetties extend-
ing from the shore across the bar. Mr. Goodyear completed his con-
tract in 1899, having secured a channel across the bar with a mini-
mum depth of 25 feet and a minimum width of 150 feet and for
which he has received an aggregate sum of $220,000. This experi-
ment has demonstrated that jetties would not have been economical
at that place and which, it is estimated by the officer now in charge
of that work, would cost the sum of $2,829,608.
The army officers in charge of the inspection of this work were
apparently much prejudiced against Mr. Goodyear's methods of deep-
ening the channel and it was not until they were relieved of this duty
and an official of the Coast and Geoditic Survey assigned to it, that
he was able to get a certificate for results obtained which the law
required before payments could be made to him. The delay in secur-
ing payment for results obtained and other expenses not strictly
pertaining to the work itself, made this contract unprofitable to Mr.
Goodyear, but the government reaped the benefit and a valuable
lesson was taught.
In 1899 the Secretary of War transmitted to Congress a plan for
the improvement of South West Pass, Mississippi river, with a view
of securing a navigable channel of adequate width and of 35 feet
depth, the estimated cost of which was $13,000,000. When this mat-
ter was being considered by the committees of the House and Sen-
ate, Prof. L. M. Haupt submitted a proposition to secure a channel
of the same dimensions and guarantee the results for $6,000,000. The
matter was, therefore, referred back to the War Department for
revision with the result that an entirely different plan was submitted
designed to secure the same result but at an estimated cost of $6,000,-


000 instead of $13,000,000 and thus the estimated cost of this improve-
ment has been reduced $7,000,000.
In 1890 there was organized in the State of Texas a private corpor-
ation known as the Aransas Pass Harbor Company. Among other
things which it purposed to do, this company undertook to deepen the
entrance to the harbor of Aransas Pass, Texas, and after some pre-
liminary experiments, it secured the services of three civil engineers,
who constituting a board, prepared a plan for the improvement
desired, and which was designed to secure an entrance channel of
ample width for navigation and having a depth of 20 feet at mean
low tide. This plan contemplated the use of a single curved struc-
ture placed upon the bar remote from the shore and designed to
utilize the forces of nature to develop the channel in such a way as
to require the minimum amount of artificial works. The structure
was partially completed by the company in 1896 and the entire work
. was afterwards transferred to the government and, being referred
to a board of Army engineers, a report was submitted recommending
a different plant which was estimated to cost $1,525,000. This plan
was to utilize so much of the work in place as could be made to con-
formed to a two jetty system and the rest was to be removed.
During the present session when this matter came up for consid-
eration by the River and Harbor committee of the House and the
Commerce committee of the Senate, Prof. Haupt submitted a propo-
ition for himself and associates, to complete the plan made for the
Aransas Pass Harbor Company, and guaranteed a 20 foot navigable
channel across the bar for the sum of $500,000, and agreed to furnish
a bond in the sum of $50,000 for faithful performance of contract.
While this proposition was not accepted, for purely political reasons
the committees concluded that the plan of the Harbor Company
should be completed by the goverment engineers, and $250,000 is
inserted in the bill for continuing this work as designed for the
Harbor Company.
This decision of the committees was reached at the instance of
Col. McKinzie who stated to the commerce committee that this plan
would be faithfully carried out and that he was personally as anxious
to see it thoroughly tested as any member of the committee.
These instances of departure from what may be termed the reg-
ular method of securing plans for the improvement of rivers and
harbors are given as matters of history and to show what an enor-
mous saving to the government has been effected by a few individuals
working not only without encouragement from the government but
in the face of much official opposition. In these four works alone
there is a visible saving to the government of about $20,000,000.
It is admitted that a very large amount of money has been wasted
on account of defective plans. It is probable that fully one-half of
the money expended in harbor work on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts
would have accomplished better results if the best plan that could


have been devised had been adopted in each particular case. What
more certain way can there be of securing the best plan than by
open competition? Results are what the government is after. Let
the Secretary of War be authorized to solicit bids for securing the
results desired and then the person who can back up his plan with a
guarantee of results will be the one to get the work. Such a policy
would bring to the service of the government the best engineering
talent in the country, without cost, and would insure the utmost pos-
sible economy in its expenditures for river and harbor improvements.
There should moreover be no objection to this policy from those now
in charge of the works for there would be no change in their control
or supervision, and on the other hand the civil engineers of the
country would be put in possession of a clientage of immense value
and to which they are rightfully entitled.


COMPARATIVE ECONOMY OF STRUCTURES.
COMPILED FROM VARIOUS SOURCES.
The engineer, no matter what branch of the profession he may
follow, is likely to be called upon to decide as to the relative economy
of different structures or machines for accomplishing' the same ends.
Some of these structures or machines may be much cheaper than
others in first cost, but their life may be shorter, or the annual
expense of maintaining them greater; and it is often a question of
some complexity to determine correctly which in the end is the most
economical.
In deciding, for instance, upon the type of pumping engine to use
in a problem of water-supply, it is frequently necessary to compare
pumps and boilers giving different duties, differing in first cost,
attendance and annual expense, and have probably different expec-
tations of life.
In planning bridges and viaducts, the choice of design may lie
between the stone arch, costing a large sum, but requiring little or no-
expense for maintenance; a steel bridge, costing much less, but liable
to wear out or to be outgrown by the rapid increase in the weight of
rolling stock, and requiring some annual outlay for repairs, painting
and maintenance; and a temporary wooden bridge, or timber trestle,
cheap, but comparatively short-lived and requiring frequent atten.
tion.
Again, in comparing chilled-iron with steel-tired car wheels, the
same form of question appears. The engineer will readily call to
mind numerous cases where the same class of reasoning should be
made use of.
The need will exist longer than the life of the structure, and it
will be necessary to supply a series of structures, one succeeding
another. The truest economy does not lie necessarily in the choice
of the design of least first cost. It will be well to determine what,
in the long run, is the structure of greatest economic value; and,
when a structure or machine falls out of repair and becomes unfit for
further use, it is important to be able to decide correctly whether it
is real economy to repair it or build a new one.
A. This class of problems may be attacked in various ways. For
instance, one may find the justifiable outlay in building a structure
that will last a large, K, in instead of a small number, n, of years.
The amount of $1.00 in n years is (1 + ?•)•'.
„ ,m. 100 100 100 „ . M . . „

The second term of the series is the sum that will amount to $100
in ?! years at r per cent, per annum, compound interest, or the present
worth of $100 n years hence. The third term is the same for 2 ?i years,
and so on.
Examples.—What outlay would be justified to make a structure
last 100 years instead of 10 years, at 6 per cent, compound interest
per annum?
r - Kino 4- 10° 4- 10° -u 100 _

That is, one would be justified in spending $226, instead of $100, or
126 per cent. more.
To last 40 years, instead of 10 years; interest as before?
C = MOO + n-rSm + rrn^S + 'T7SS5 = *204.42,
100 ^100 100
(1.06)10 + (1.06)» + (1.06)'
or 104 per cent. more.
To last 300 years instead of 60 years, at 6 %?
C - $100 + pjgp + (TQgps, + (LOe)«" - $103-12
or only 3 per cent, more
Note the small allowable increase of cost when the first proposed
structure has a long life.
If an iron rail will last 5 years and a steel rail 20 years in the
same track, what comparative outlay, with interest at 4 per cent.,
will be justified?
or the steel, including laying, is worth three times as much as the iron,
including laying.
But suppose the iron rails, in a road of light travel, will last 15
years, and the steel 60 years, interest as before?
or twice as much.
If an ordinary post and rail fence will last 20 years and a stone
wall 100 years, what outlay will the wall justify, when money is worth
5 per cent.?
c = *100 + era?}* + (iSj" = 8159-26
or 60 per cent. more.


If the ordinary railroad tie will last 7 years, and the squared oak
or redgum 21 years, what outlay will the latter justify, with interest
at 6 per cent, per annum?
c - $10° + (w + w&amp;p = $210'73,
or nearly 111 per cent more.
The cost, in all cases, must include all materials, labor, tools and
«very contingent expense.
It will be seen that the current rate of interest materially affects
the result, as well as does the length of time the temporary structure
is calculated to last. Thus instead of $100,

The cost of annual repairs to a wooden structure to last for 10
jears would probably be greater than that for a brick structure to
last 50 years. Suppose the former to be 1 i per cent, on the outlay
and the latter 1 per cent. Then the present value of an annuity for
50 years must be added. The present value of $1.00 per annum, to
become due at the end of each year for 50 years to realize 4 per
-cent., is $21.48. For one-half percent., take $10.74.
Then, from above table, C = 264.85 + 10.74 = $275.59 instead of
$100, or 175 per cent, greater conomical outlay for the brick structure.
Again: to determine the comparative values of two or more struc-
tures for a specified object, similar only that they would all fill the
purpose while they lasted, select that one whose life is the longest
and assume its cost to be the real value of the structure. Compare
the others in turn with the first. The difference between the rela-
tive value of each structure, on a basis of valuation fixed by the cost
of the one with the longest life, and the actual cost of each structure
will be the measure of the economy or extravagance of such a
design.

Let C = cost and assumed value of .the structure with longest life.
N = its life in years.

v, i',, i-j = equivalent relative values of other structures to be

The cost of the structure of longest life, at the end of its life,

On the other hand, by making use of a succession of structures,
with shorter life of-n. years each, the cost at the end of n years would
be b (1 + r) - — t.

Example I.—It is proposed to erect a bridge of a certain span for
a railroad. A steel riveted bridge will cost $6,900, and will last 85 years.
A wooden bridge will cost $4,500, and will last ten years; or, if it is
covered, at an expense of of $150, it will last 20 years. Which con-
struction will be most economical, if interest is computed at 6 per

Example's.—A. wooden house has reached such a state a dilapida-
tion that it is unfit for further use without repairs amounting to $850.
It would then serve its purpose for four years longer. A new house,
if built, would cost $6,000, and would last for 40 years. At a rate of
interest of 6 per cent, is it more advisable to repair or build anew?

It is generally a great economy to make repairs, if possible,
rather than to rebuild, and it will be found that more money can be
profitably spent in repairs than it would ordinarily be thought wise
to do.
The demonstration makes a comparison between the cost of a
single structure with a long life and one of a series of structures,
similar to each other, but with shorter lives: but it is not necessarily
advantageous to continue the series by erecting another upon the
same plan. The best use of money has been effected in choosing the
first design for the first structure. During its life, a certain time has
elapsed, prices of materials and labor have changed, new materials
come into use, types of construction have altered and possibly the

needs in the structure have been modified; therefore fresh calcula-
tions with the latest data should guide the proper choice of each
structure in the series.
C. The investigation may be taken up in a different way. A certain
structure or machine costs A dollars, it requires the expenditure of
B dollars for maintenance and repairs at intervals of n years; it will
last for N years; and when worn out it may have a scrap value of S
dollars. A second structure or machine for accomplishing the same
object may be represented as to value by similar letters. Which of
these will be the more economical, as a permanent thing, the rate of
interest being r per cent., payable annually?
Compute the amount of present capital sufficient to provide perma-
nently for each of these structures or machines, and the one which
requires the smaller capital will be the more economical. Or, find,
by the same method, what the cost A, of a (perhaps new) appliance
must be, to be more economical than a similar appliance in use, under
various suppositions as to the life, cost of maintenance, etc.
The present capital required for any structure will be made up of
three parts,
1°. A, the cost of the machine or structure.
2". A sum which, put at interest at r per cent., will increase
in n years by an amount H. This sum will be t-.—;; ,. If r = 6
J J ( 1 + ?•)» — 1
per cent., 1 + r = 1.06.
3°. A sum which, put at interest at ?■ per cent., will amount in N
years to itself plus ( A — 6'). Since, at the end of N years, the worn
out structure will be sold for &lt;S dollars, there will result a sum suffi-
cient to enable one again to expend A for a new structure, and have
the original sum remaining, which in another N years will amount
to a sufficient sum to purchase a third structure, and so on indefinitely
_,. . A— S
This sum is v^-—. ns ;•

The total present capital involved in the use of any structure is

[If the interest, at rate r per annum, is payable semi-annually,
the above denominators become (1 + I ?•) *" — 1 and (1 + i r)2K — 1 ].
The formula becomes simplified if S is quite small in comparison
with the first cost A, and if li is the uniform annual cost of main
tenance, repairs, coal, attendance, etc., as in the case of a pumping
engine, when n — 1, and
C = A + - + (1 + r)H_r
It is seen not to be strictly correct to compare two pumping
engines, for instance, as a permanent investment, and assumed of


equal durability, on the basis of first cost plus the capitalized cost of
operation; for such a comparison omit the last term in the above
formula. However the value of this term rapidly decreases as N
becomes larger; and a high rate of interest also diminishes its signifi-
cance.
Example.— A = $6,000; N = 15 yrs; B = coal, $1,000+ engineer,
$600 + repairs, oil and waste, $200.
A' = $3000: N' = 8 yrs.; B' = 1400 + 750 + 250. r = .05.

D. Another method of finding the relative economy of two or more
structures is to determine for each the annual cost, which may then
be directly compared. The annual payments .needed to maintain a
structure in perpetuity are:
1st. Interest on first cost. — The cost of any structure is the
amount of capital which its owner voluntarily keeps in it, and on this
amount the interest must be charged against the structure. If the
structure was not built or bought by the present owner, but inherited
by him, its first cost is what he could sell it for. If it has no market
value, its cost to him is nothing.
2d. Annual repairs. — Here are included ordinary repairs, watch-
men, insurance, etc.
In spite of annual repairs, the structure in time wears out and
must be replaced either in whole or in part.
3d. Annual payments to renewal fund—or the proportion of the
sum finally needed to renew the structure, chargeable each year.
If this fund is raised all at once, when actually needed, the
amount chargeable to each year is the total sum divided by the num-
ber of years in the life of the structure. But the amount of each
contribution will be much smaller if actually paid each year, and
improved at compound interest like a sinking fund for the payment
of bonds.
A = first cost.
S = value of old materials when no longer fit for use, and also
the value of so much of the structure as needs no renewal.
H = cost of annual repairs.
n = number of years the structure lasts before renewal.
r — rate of interest.
Amount or final value of an annuity of $1 compounded each year,
(1-4-r)"— 1
for 71 years = J .
'The final cost of renewal = A — 8. If the renewals should exceed


first cost, S will be the excess, and the total cost of renewal will be ■
A+ 8.
The annual payment to renewal fund will be:
The annual interest charge is Ar.
The total annual cost of the structure will therefore be
Ar + Ji + ( A - S)
(1 + r)» - 1
Example.—The relative economy of a wooden and a steel bridge
for the same location, 5 spans of 150 feet.
Wooden bridge—first cost A — $25 per ft., = $18,750. Scrap value,
$2 per ft., = $1500. Life, 10 yrs. Annual repairs, watchmen, etc.,
$1000. r = .06. Then
1,125 + 1000 + 17,250 X 0.07587 = $3,434.
Steel bridge—first cost = $60 per ft. = $45,000. Scrap value =
$7.50 per ft. — $5,625. Life 60 yrs. Annual repairs, no watchman,
$150. /• = .06. Then
2,700+ 150 + 39,375 X 0.001875 = $2,924.
Thus a saving of $510 per annum is made by using the steel bridge,
to say nothing of the greater security from fire.
EXPERIMENTAL WORK IN NAVAL ARCHITECTURE.
PROF. H. C. SADLER.
The assistance which theory obtains from experiment in any
science is unquestionable. This is perhaps more especially the case
with applied sciences such as engineering.
Experiments may be conducted in one of two ways. Firstly, the
problem in question may be discussed in all its details, and, so far as
experience with something of a similar nature can be called in to its
assistance, a solution obtained.
The result, if of an engineering nature, may take the form of a
structure in which time will decide whether the original surmises
were correct or otherwise. Provided the whole stands the tests of
time and general working, it may be considered a success in that it
has fulfilled the necessary requirements, but by what amount it is on
the safe side or how nearly it is a failure, is to a certain extent an
indeterminate quantity. Such a process may be called an experi-
ment on a full sized scale.


The second class of experiments are those in which a design,
similar to the required one but on a much smaller scale, is tested
in a laboratory and its qualities determined before the full sized
structure is commenced. Provided that the laws connecting the
various qualities in relation to dimensions are known, the model
experiment will furnish all the necessary data regarding the success
or failure of the proposition. In such experiments certain details
may be varied and the effects of these upon the whole determined at
a relatively small cost as compared with the same process on the full
sized scale. Thus the degree of success, or to use an engineering
expression "the factor of safety of success " may be readily deter-
mined.
How often, for example, do we see the account of the " success-
ful" trial of a vessel which has obtained one knot over her
guaranteed speed and is capable of carrying several hundred tons
over her required amount? Such a result is certainly a successful
one from an owners' but scarcely so from an engineers' point of
view; real success being a fulfillment of conditions without wide
margins.
One has only to notice the number of engineering laboratories
in connection with the various educational institutions, to see the
importance with which experimental work in general engineering is
regarded.
In naval engineering, however, laboratories for conducting exper-
ments upon resistance and propulsion and various other problems
connected with vessels, are few and far between. At the present time
these are owned almost exclusively by governments which possess a
navy, and therefore are not available to the general public. The
results obtained from such are not always made public, owing to the
necessity for secrecy in many cases.
A university is not limited in this way, and the experimental
tank which will be placed in the new engineering building', will give
the University of Michigan the distinction of being the first to build
and equip such an one which will be available for use irrespective of
weather conditions, as these tend to vitiate results obtained when
experiments are conducted in open water.
A short description of the tank and methods of experimenting
therewith may be of interest. The tank will be placed in the base-
ment of the new building and will be 300 feet long, 22 feet wide and
20 feet deep, and of uniform section throughout. This length is
required in order that a uniform speed may be obtained during the
central period of a run and sufficient space left for starting and
stopping. The breadth and depth are determined from the size of
model to be tested and are arranged so that they will not have any
effect upon the resistance of the model. On each side of the tank
and extending its whole length, is a railway upon which is mounted a
truck earring a suitable dynamometer through which the model ves-


sel is towed and the force required or the resistance to motion at any
speed obtained. The truck is driven by a motor which is capable of
variation of speed to any desired extent. Devices for recording' time
and distance are also fitted, as well as suitable apparatus for testing
model propellers and determining- the thrust, revolutions, turning
moment, etc.
The models of vessels will be from twelve to fourteen feet in
length and constructed of paraffin wax or wood.
Great care must be taken in the preparation of these to ensure
their being exact reproductions of the form required. A specially
designed machine somewhat on the principle of a pantograph is used
for this purpose. When finished the form is tested and when correct
the model is ballasted to the required immersion, and attached to the
dynamometer in the above mentioned truck. This latter is then
moved at varying speeds and the pull on the dynamometer, that is
the resistance of the vessel to forward motion, registered.
In this way a curve of resistance in termB of speed is obtained
for the model in question. By repeating such experiments upon dif-
ferent types of models, the effect of variation of form upon resistance
may be readily determined.
In passing from the model to the full-sized vessel recourse is had
to Froude's "Law of Comparison," which stated briefly is as follows:
two vessels moving at corresponding speeds—that is at speeds vary-
ing as the square root of their respective linear dimensions, will have
their wave making resistances proportional to the cube of their
linear dimensions, the frictional resistance being treated independ-
antly in the usual way. Thus the resistance of a full-sized ship may be
determined with a high degree of accuracy from the results of trials
uponmodelsof say one-thirtieth to one-fortieth its size.
The other important question upon which systematic experiment-
ing is required, is that of the propeller. At present, although a
great amount of valuable work has been done upon this subject by
the Froudes and others, there still remain a number of points upon
which information is required. In this, as in the case of the model
and ship, the laws connecting the results of model propellers with
those of full size are of a similar nature.
In a short article, such as this, it is impossible to give a compre-
hensive account of the various problems that arise in connection
with the resistance and propulsion of ships, but it may be mentioned
that a full enquiry into the subject involves not only numerous exper-
iments upon models of ships and propellers independently, but also
upon the two in conjunction. The presence of the ship as influenc-
ing the performance of the propeller, and the action of the pro-
peller as modifying the resistance of the ship, are questions that
open a wide field for investigation.
Other problems such as those relating to rolling and pitching of
vessels and the influence of bilge keels upon these qualities and


also upon resistance, are still open to systematic experiment. Apart
from their scientific value, such experiments as above described,
have an eminently practical value. An illustration may perhaps
serve to emphasize this point. Suppose a vessel is designed to fulfil
certain conditions as to speed, displacement, etc., and on experi-
ment it is found that with a modification of the original form of the
vessel and design of the propeller, the required results could be
obtained with the expenditure of say 15 per cent, less power (which
figure might easily be realized). This means that the first cost of
the machinery and the amount of coal consumed would be decreased
approximately in the same ratio. In the case of a large Atlantic
liner the saving in first cost under the above consumption might
amount to about $100,000, and the saving in the coal bill over a year's
running to about $15,000 or more.
A full description of the apparatus used in connection with the
tank is reserved for a later number.
THEORETICAL EFFICIENCIES OF VARIOUS EXPANSION
CURVES FOR STEAM.
FRANK C. WAGNER, '85.
Rankine in his steam engine calculates the theoretical efficiency
of superheated steam for isothermal expansion and for adiabatic
expansion, finding a slight advantage in isothermal expansion. Prof.
DeVolson Wood in his Thermodynamics compares the efficiencies of
superheated steam expanding isothermally and saturated steam
expanding adiabatically and finds them to differ but little, when the
initial pressure and ratio of expansion are the same for both. A
natural inference from these and similar comparisons has been that
the transfer of heat to the steam in a steam engine during expansion
is, if not an advantage, at least no detriment.
It is well known that the use of a steam jacket is not advan-
tageous under all circumstances. While a large part of the waste
in the use of a steam jacket is undoubtedly due to the transfer of
heat to the exhaust steam, yet it is worth while to consider whether
the transfer of heat to the steam during expansion is an advantage
or not. Both Rankine's and Wood's calculations for the isothermal
expansion of superheated steam are to be criticized for their assump-
tions, (1) that the expansion curve is an equilateral hyperbola and
(2) that the latent heat of expansion is equal to the external work done
during expansion. If we except Hirn's experiments upon super-
heated steam and Zeuner's equation for the same, neither of these
assumptions is legitimate.


For the purpose of making a more careful comparison, the writer
has calculated the theoretical efficiencies for both isothermal and
adiabatic expansions of (1) superheated steam, (2) dry saturated
steam, and (3) steam containing 24 per cent, moisture, the initial
steam pressure, the ratio of expansion and the back pressure being
the same in all cases. For superheated steam Zeuner's equation, as
given in English units by Peabody in his Thermodynamics, p. 130, has
been used, viz.:
pv = 93.5 r — 971 P i-
The value of y for superheated steam has been taken as 1.33 (.see
Peabody's Tliermodynamics, p. 129). The work done during adiabatic
expansion was calculated by the well-known formula,
/ p dv = P! fj I 1 . I
./ ) -1 L rv-ij
For saturated and moist steam the value of y was obtained by Zeuner's
equation (see Wood's Thermodynamics, p. 152). In the case of saturated
steam the work done during adiabatic expansion was calculated
according, to the theoretical law as well, and the value thus obtained
is the one given (see Wood's Thermodynamics, p. 177).
To obtain the work done during the isothermal expansion of the
superheated steam the expansion curve was plotted upon cross sec-
tion paper from Zeuner's equation, making r constant. The adia-
batic curve for superheated steam was also plotted and the area
included between the two curves and the release line was measured
by a planimeter. Multiplying by the proper constant and adding to
the work of adiabatic expansion we obtain the work of isothermal
expansion.
The degree of superheating was so chosen that at the end of the
adiabatic expansion the steam would be dry saturated steam. The
amount of heat delivered to the steam up to the point of cut oft
above the assumed feed water temperature was found from the steam
tables and the specific heat of superheated steam, which was taken
as 0.4805. Peabody's Steam Tables were used.
The amount of heat transmitted to the steam during isothermal
expansion is equal to the excess of external work done plus the
excess of internal energy at the end of the expansion over the cor-
responding quantities for adiabatic expansion. The excess of exter-
nal work done was found graphically as described. The excess of
internal energy, since the steam is dry saturated steam at the end
of the adiabatic expansion, is equal to the heat required to superheat
the steam at constant volume from the temperature at the end of
the adiabatic expansion up to that at the end of the isothermal
expansion.
In the cases of saturated and moist steam the equilateral hyper-
bola was used in place of the true isothermal. As in the case of


49
superheated steam the heat absorbed during expansion is equal to
the sum of the excess of external work above that of adiabatic
expansion plus the excess of internal energy at the end of the expan-
sions. The excess of external work was found by calculation and
also graphically. The internal energy at the end of the expansion
is equal to the heat of the liquid plus the internal work of vapori-
zation plus the specific heat at constant volume times the degrees of
superheating. Or if the steam be moist, it is equal to the heat of
the liquid plus the percentage of steam times the internal work of
vaporization.
The following table gives the results of the calculations. All
quantities of heat and work are per cubic foot of steam at cut off-

That is, the steam is in all cases assumed to be used in a cylinder,
having a stroke displacement of four cubic feet and no clearance.
In the case of the moist steam it is assumed that the steam is deliv-
ered to the engine in that condition, and not that the moisture is due
to cylinder condensation.
Comparing the efficiencies of the same kind of steam when
expanded adiabatically and when heat is absorbed during expansion,
it appears that for superheated steam isothermal expansion is more
efficient than adiabatic expansion, but that for saturated and also
for moist steam the reverse is true. The case most commonly met
with in practice is that of moist steam containing from 20 to 40 per

cent, of moisture at cut-off. In this case the absorption of heat from
a steam jacket during expansion is a positive detriment. Of course
the effect of the steam jacket in reducing cylinder condensation is
the main argument for its use, but it may be well to consider that
the action for the jacket during expansion and during exhaust tends
to reduce the economy of the engine, so that the next result may
not in all cases be upon the right side of the balance sheet. May it
not be wise to inquire if some other method of preventing cylinder
condensation should not be adopted which shall avoid the wastes
incident to the use of the steam jacket? The use of superheated
steam is evidently an advantage, either with or without a steam


jacket. When used with a steam jacket superheated steam does not
cause a lowering of the efficiency by reason of the transfer of heat
during expansion, as is the case with moist steam. The loss due to
the transfer of heat direct to the exhaust steam still remains how-
ever.
It may be well •to call attention to the fact that the range of
temperatures between which the superheated steam is worked in the
examples taken is much greater than in the cases of the dry satur-
ated and moist steam, so that it is not proper to compare the values
for the efficiency obtained with the superheated steam with those
obtained for the saturated steam. The purpose of this paper has
been simply to compare isothermal expansion with adiabatic expan-
sion of the same quality of steam, and to make the comparison for
the three cases of superheated steam, dry saturated steam, and
moist steam.
SHRINKAGE OF SOIL ROLLED IN SIX-INCH LAYERS.
ALEXANDER E. KASTL, CLASS OF '85.
In the construction of the North Dike of the Wachusett Reser-
voir* near Clinton, Mass , for the purpose of making a water-tight
cut-off, a longitudinal trench was excavated under the proposed dike
and is being filled with soil stripped from the site of the reservoir.
The specification provides that "The soil deposited in the cut-off shall
be spread in six-inch layers, dampened if so required by the engineer,
and rolled with a heavy, grooved roller, where it is practicable to
use a roller, and thoroughly rammed or shovelled into water, as
directed by the engineer in other places;" also that "The material
(referring to the soil) shall be freed from stumps, roots one-half inch
or more in diameter and other wood, and from large stones. The
stumps, roots and other wood shall be burned, and the large stones
shall be deposited where directed by the engineer."
Under one of the contracts recently finished the opportunity pre-
sented itself of making an accurate comparison between the volume
of soil as excavated from the reservoir site and the volume it occu-
pied in a part of the cut-off trench after being compacted. The
purpose of this paper is to present this result.
The length of the trench which was filled was 1375 feet. About
500 feet of this length was about 30 feet deep, 30 feet wide at the
bottom, with side slopes of approximately 1 to 1. The remainder
varied in depth from 0 to 25 feet and in width from 50 to 80 feet
•See Fourth Annual Report, Metropolitan Water Board, Boston, 1899, page 72.

between slope stakes, with side slopes of approximately 1 to 1, having
been partially filled under a previous contract.
The soil was excavated from an area of 04 acres to an average
depth of 0.78 ft. About 59 acres of this area contained stumps. The
land from which the soil was excavated was called sprout land, —
land which had been cleared of forest growth and again allowed to
grow over with trees and brush.
The volume of the soil measured in excavation was 80355 cubic
yards.
The volume of the soil after it was deposited and compacted in
the cut-off trench was 50735 cubic yards, or 29620 cubic yards less than
the volume measured in excavation. The final levels were taken a
few days after the completion of the work.
Prom the above it follows that the shrinkage of the soil was 37
per cent., calling the volume of 80355 cubic yards 100 per cent. This
shrinkage includes roots one-half an inch or more in diameter and
stumps so far as they were originally embedded in the soil, but which
were removed and burnt. Roots one-half an inch or more in diam-
eter, stumps or other wood were not allowed to be deposited with the
soil in the cut-off trench. The soil was free from stones.
The volume of the soil excavated was determined from levels
taken when there was no frost in the ground. The first levels were
taken after the ground was cleared of trees and brush, which were
removed and burnt or otherwise disposed of, and before the contrac-
tor had commenced grubbing; and the final levels after the final
"excavation was finished. The volume of the soil excavation includes
the roots and stumps so far as the same were imbedded in the layer
of soil excavated. The levels extended over the entire area stripped
and were taken not more than 25 feet apart; that is, not less than 70
cuts or depths of soil were determined for each acre. The ground
was divided into squares 500 ft. on a side, the corners of which were
permanently marked, and the sides were used as base lines for
.the cross section work. The average depth given, 0.78 ft. is the
total volume of the soil excavated divided by the area, and is only
intended to give some idea of the depth of the soil stripping. All
the soil containing i per cent, or more of organic matter is removed
from the reservoir site.
The volume of the soil when in the trench was calculated from
accurate cross sections, taken not more than 25 feet apart before and
after the filling of the trench.
Before rolling the soil it was watered as much as it would bear
without sticking to the roller.
The type of roller which was used weighs about C0O0 pounds, and
is drawn by two horses. The cylinder of the roller is 5 feet long and
is composed of 19 cast iron wheels, 3 inches thick at rim, 10 being
2 feet 11 inches, and 9, 2 feet 8 inches in diameter, respectively,
arranged alternately.


The soil was transported in one-horse carts, and spread by hand
in 6-inch layers. Less than 100 cubic yards were shovelled into
water.
The soil was deposited at an average rate of about 1100 cubic
yards per day, and in general it required two rollers to roll the soil.
WATER SUPPLY OF LARGE CITIES.
GEORGE Y. WISNER, C. E., CLASS OF '75.
One of the most important problems which confronts the modern
hydraulic engineer is that of furnishing a pure and wholesome sup-
ply of water for large cities. In nearly all cases nature limits the
sources from which the supply must be drawn, and in some instances
there is no alternative except to determine the amount of purifica-
tion necessary to render the available water supply unobjectionable.
Generally the choice of supply lies between the water from lakes
or rivers, and water collected from adjacent watersheds and stored
in large reservoirs. The former is generally more or less polluted
from sewage of towns on tributary streams, and the wholesomeness
of the latter will depend on the character of the watershed and the
density of population on the territory drained.
The governing factors which usually determine the project to be
adopted, are the quality of the respective supplies available, the
quantity which may be relied upon in years of extreme low water,
and the cost to deliver it to consumers.
From a sanitary point of view it is always better to obtain a water
supply from an unpoluted source than to undertake to purify the
water of lakes or rivers which have become polluted.
Theoretically the water of polluted lakes and rivers may be
made perfectly pure and wholesome by a proper system of filtering
but in actual practice such a method of supply always embodies
an element of danger, due to the fact that filters do not always work
with the efficiency for which designed, and that carlessness on the
part of operators and the constantly changing conditions of th e water
to be purified may allow disease germs to pass through the filters.
Where a supply of water is to be obtained from a river or lake, fil-
traton must generally be resorted to if a pure and wholesome water
is required, for the reason that there are but few large streams
which are not badly polluted from the sewage of adjacent towns and
cities.
It is true that in the majority of cases, if taken into the courts,
the city or town complained of would be ordered to dispose of its
sewage in some less objectionable manner, but since all cities are
practically guilty of the same offense it would be a somewhat risky


proceeding for most towns to start any action against their neigh-
bors.
The rapid growth of American cities, with the consquent increase
in the pollution of streams, has been such that the future prosperity
of many large places depends upon better and more wholesome sup-
plies of water being furnished for domestic purposes.
At Chicago where the water supply is taken from Lake Mich-
igan, the sewage pollution became such that the city was obliged to
expend over $32,000,000 to dilute the sewage with water from the
lake and turn the flow down the Illinois and Mississippi valleys,—a
proceeding which has relieved the difficulty at Chicago, and caused
serious complaints from the cities along the river through which the
sewage is discharged.
The City of St. Louis which at present secures its water from the
Mississippi River, has started legal proceedings in the U. S. Courts
to compel Chicago to discontinue the pollution of the Illinois and
Mississippi Rivers. Yet at St. Louis the entire sewage of the city is
discharged into the river. A commission of hydraulic engineers
has recently made an investgation and report relative to the best
method of furnishing St. Louis with a pure and wholesome supply of
water in the future, and has recommended abandoning the present
source of supply, and obtaining water from the watershed of the
Meramec River, where a first-class water for both domestic and man-
ufacturing purposes can be had at an elevation which will give the
necessary pressure in the distribution mains, with a gravity flow from
the storage reservoir. The advisability of the change is very appar-
ent from the fact that the present water rates for the dirty river
water will be more than sufficient to pay all expense, interest on cost
of construction, and sinking fund for the redemption of bonds.
If the present source of supply is continued in the future, filtra-
tion will be absolutely necessary, which will require an expensive
plant, and the use of an average of 500 lbs. of sulphate of alumina
per million gallons. The sulphate of alumina is decomposed in the
chemical action which takes place in this process, the sulphuric acid
uniting with the bases of the carbonates of lime and magnesia in the
water, forming sulphates which are the elements of permanent
hardness in water, and constitute the incrustating ingredients which
form hard scale in boilers and render a water poor for steam
purposes.
The influence of the filter interests is becoming very great, and
there are good reasons to believe that in certain instances it has been
exerted to such an extent that the installation of filters has been
recommended where other methods of supply would have been better
and more economical for the consumers.
There are places however, where filtration of the water supply is
the only posible safe-guard against those diseases which result from
the use of polluted water, as for instance, is the case at such lake


cities as Detroit, Cleveland and Buffalo, where the supply is taken
from bodies of water into which large quantities of sewage is con-
stantly being discharged. It is true that the pollution is greatly
diluted before reaching the intake pipes, yet there is but little doubt
that a large amount of typhoid fever at times prevalent in these
cities, is due to this cause. At several of our principal cities where
different sources of supply were available, the choice has been based
upon the comparative economy of the different plans, a somewhat
questionable proceeding when it is considered that the future devel-
opment of a city is largely affected by the wholesomeness of its water
supply.
The works now being constructed at Pittsburg, Pa., were recom-
mended for the reason that it was estimated that the cost per mil-
lion gallons for a gravity supply from an unpolluted source would be
greater than the cost of filtering a supply pumped from the Allegheny
river, yet it is admitted by the engineer who made the recommen-
dation that, "it is not certain that the Allegheny river water, even
with filtration will be a suitable source of supply for Pittsburg, at
the point selected, for a longer period than 40 years." Under such
conditions it is quite probable that a supply by gravity flow from a
mountain watershed, without a constantly growing danger from sew-
age pollution, would in a long period be much more economical than
a filtered supply at a lower first cost, but which must be eventually
abandoned.
A water to be satisfactory for domestic purposes must not only
be clear, but also free from all disease producing germs. It is
claimed that a good system of filters will remove 99 per cent, of the
bacteria in the water treated, but when we remember that these bac-
teria often exceed 100,000 per cubic centimeter, it is evident that the
number left in the effluent may be sufficient to start an epidemic
among those that drink it.
The following table made up from reports of water supply inves-
tigations shows the average amount of suspended solids in a number
of raw waters which are either being filtered, or are being experi-
mentally stndied with reference to adoption of filters for purifica-
tion.

At Lawrence and Albany slow sand filters were adopted and are
in use. At Washington slow sand filters, with the use of a coagulant


at times of greatest turbidity of the Potomac river water was rec-
ommended by the engineer commission and adopted by Congress.
At Louisville and Cincinnati exhaustive experiments were made
with various forms of mechanical filters, and plans adopted for the
filtration of the Ohio river water.
At, Cincinnati, however, a first-class gravity supply was available
from a watershed in the Cumberland mountains, in eastern Kentucky,
which was reported adversely, for the reason that the estimated cost
($27,000,000) was very large compared with the quantity of water
needed for the city supply.
During 1900 and 1901 extensive experiments were made at New
Orleans to determine the advisability of filtering the Mississippi
River water for the supply of that city, with the result that the
investigators reported that satisfactory results could be obtained by
sedimentation in settling basins, coagulation, and filtration with rapid
or mechanical filters. The results at New Orleans are to a certain
extent applicable to the water at St. Louis, but since at times the
amount of sediment which would remain in the St. Louis water after
24 hours sedimentation, would be greater than the average amount
carried by the river at New Orleans, it is still on open question
whether a perfectly pure and wholesome supply can be obtained by
filtration of river water at St. Louis at reasonable cost, and since
water of much better quality for both domestic and steam purposes
can be obtained at less expense to the consumers by gravity flow from
the upper watershed of the Meramec River, it is quite probable that
the latter project may be adopted.
The large amount of experimental work which has been done to
determine the efficiency of various kinds of filters with the different
waters to be treated, has been of immense benefit to the science of
water purification, but by no means establishes the claim that equally
as good results may be obtained in the large plants necessary for the
supply of cities as in the small apparatus for experimental purposes.
Where water carries a large amount of fine sediment, the time
required for sedimentation is a function of the depth of the settling
basins and of the movements of the water through the basins. In
small experimental tanks the water is brought to a state of rest
quickly, and as the depth through which the fine particles have to
fall is small the time determination for sedimentation has but little
bearing on what may be needed in actual practice.
Where coagulation is necessary, a complete admixture of the
chemicals and water is easily obtained in small plants, while in the
treatment of large quantities this is not always obtained.
The quantity of water which must be provided for depends upon
the probable future growth of the city, and the average number of
gallons which may be required daily for each inhabitant, both of
which are largely conjectural.
From investigations of the amount of water used for different


purposes in cities where the quantity furnished is measured, it appears
that in large cities the average volume needed for domestic, public,
and manufacturing- purposes, are respectfully about 30 gallons, 5 gal-
lons, and 25 gallons per day for each inhabitant, and that any supply
in excess of 60 gallons per day per capita, goes to underground leak
age and unnecessary waste.
With proper supervision there should be no difficulty in keeping,
the necessary average supply below 100 gallons per day per capital
The average supply for the year however, will be only about two-
thirds of that required at times of maximum consumption, for which
capacity the works must be designed.
In many American cities, 150 gallons to 250 gallans per day are
pumped for each inhabitant, but such an amount is entirely unneces-
sary and a useless waste of public funds. These conditions must be
fully considered in adopting any system of water supply for a city,
for while with a reasonable use of water the quantity available from
a watershed would be sufficient for the future needs of a city, an
excessive allowance would prevent its consideration as an available
source of supply.
The amount of water which may be annually collected from any
water shed, depends upon the area of the watershed, the average and
mimimum annual precipitation, the character of the soil, and the
amount of water which may be stored in reservoirs for use during
excessively dry seasons.
The amount of run-off which may be collected from any water-
shed is the difference between the total precipitation and the amount
of water which will be absorbed and evaporated. For normal years
when the ground is kept sufficiently moist to maintain a fair growth
of vegetation, the latter quantity is nearly constant, but for exces-
sively dry years, it is much less. On the watershed of the Upper
Hudson River, the annual precipitation from 1888 to 1898 varied from
36 inches to 54 inches, while the amount of rainfall, absorbed and
evaporated only varied between 19.2 inches and 22.4 inches, with a
mean of 21 inches.
The annual precipitation on the Sudbury watershed from which
the Boston water supply is obtained, from 1875 to 1899 varied from
38.8 inches to 57.5 with a mean of 45.8 inches, while the amount lost
by absorption and evaporation varied from 18.5 inches to 27.4 inches
with a mean of 23.3 inches.
On the Lake Superior watershed the average annual absorption is
about 16 inches, on the Lake Michigan watershed about 22 inches, and
on the Lake Erie watershed about 24 inches.
It is therefore evident that in years of small precipitation the
run-off which can be collected on any watershed will be small, and in
order to obtain a maximum safe supply, storage reservoirs must be
provided of sufficient capacity to maintain an average supply during
years of minimum precipitation.

Storage reservoirs are very beneficial for improving the quality
of all surface waters so collected, especially if the reservoir sites
have been properly cleared of all vegetable matter.
Filtered water when stored must be protected from the light in
covered reservoirs or the growth of algae in the water will be such
as to render it offensive.
THE LAKE SUPERIOR IRON ORE MINES.
L. DOUGLASS ANDERSON, '01.
The iron ore fields of the Lake Superior region are so extensive
in area and so rich in deposits as to have become a factor of the
greatest importance in the iron making industry of the world. For
this reason their description bears not the restricted interest
attached to a matter of local importance, but rather that concerned
with an industry of international significance.
The principal iron ore districts, or "ranges" as they are com-
monly called, are five in number, named as follows, in order of dis-
covery:
The Marquette, in the State of Michigan.
The Menominee, mainly in Michigan and somewhat in Wisconsin.
The Gogebic, of the same description.
The Vermillion, in Minnesota.
The Mesaba, in Minnesota.
To these might be added the Michipicoten district of the province
of Ontario, Canada, near Sault de Sainte Marie, as last year its
single mine, the Helen, produced 230,000 tons of ore.
For a long time the upper Peninsulaof Michigan, literally a "howl-
ing wilderness" in the first half of the 19th century, was invested
with rumors of marvelous mineral wealth, gold, silver and copper
being reputed to be exceedingly abundant. Despite these rumors the
State of Michigan, as the lower peninsular considered itself, regarded
the upper peninsular as an unwelcome bantling left upon its door-
step in return for the land comprising the county of Lucas which
was taken from the then territory and attached to Ohio. At that
time, Wiconsin, also a territory, and to whom the upper peninsula
once belonged, was too busy buying furs and keeping watch on the
Indians, to notice the loss of a trifle like eighteen thousand acres of
land.
Although the first explorers sought the precious minerals it is
claimed that iron ore was also known to the trappers of the Hudson
Bay Fur Company as far back as 1830. Yet the first authentic dis-
covery of iron ore must be considered as one of the great results
of the work of Dr. Douglass Houghton, who labored so hard for the

state in his effort to secure for it a systematic geological survey, and
who indeed gave up his life in this labor, he being drowned in Kewee-
naw Bay while on one of his expeditions. It is stated that Mr. W.
A. Burt, engaged in this survey in 1844, while running the east line
of township 47 north, range 27 west, in Marquette county, observed,
by means of the solar compass, " remarkable variations in the mag-
netic needle, amounting to 87 degrees from the normal."' Naturally
puzzled, Mr. Burt began to look for the cause. Under the roots of
an overturned tree, which remains to the present day, he found a
heavy glistening stone, whose properties convinced him it was iron
ore. This, the earliest recorded discovery, took place in the City of
Negaunee.
In the following year, 1845, Mr. P. M. Everett, of Jackson, Mich.,
was guided by an Indian to the Jackson mountain, where he found
the ore outcropping on the surface. Some 300 pounds were carted
down to the mouth of the Carp river and carried to Detroit and Jack-
son as specimens. A small bloom was made in the forge of a local
smithy at the latter place, from which Mr. Everett had a knife blade
made. Samples of the ore were sent to Pittsburgh iron men, but as
the samples were largely mixed with banded jasper they condemned
it as worthless.
To the city of Jackson belongs the honor of organizing the first
mining company in the far-famed Lake Superior region. In 1846 a
small bloomary was built on the Carp river and operated with ore
from what has since been known as the Jackson mine. Despite vicis-
situdes the forge successfully produced four blooms daily from two fire s
manipulated in a very primitive fashion, each bloom being about four
feet long and eight inches thick. Although three other forges were
shortly afterward started within Marquette county, mining could
not be said to have been well under way until the Jackson company
completed its dock at Marquette in 1855 and began regular shipments
in 1856. Prior to 1857 the ore was hauled for fifteen miles by mule
power over a plank road, which later became a tram road. This in
turn was followed by the railroad, the old Marquette, Houghton and
Ontonagon, now the Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic.
Next in order of discovery comes the Menominee range, lying
mainly in Dickinson county, but having also a few mines in Wiscon-
sin. The discovery of ore has been attributed to Messrs J. W. Fos-
ter and S. W. Hill in 1848, but as nothing came of it the true honor
falls to the Breen brothers who found ore in 1872. In that same year
Dr. X. P. Hulst, chemist for the Milwaukee Iron Co., was sent by
them to explore and develop this new field. After the heavy work
incident to opening a new country had been performed, the men
under him found ore in the fall of 1873, in three mines, the Breen,
the West Vulcan and the Metropolitan. The panic coming on at this
time arrested further development. Yet to Dr. Hurst belongs the
credit of systematically opening the Menominee iron range.


The first notice of the Gogebic range occurs in the report of Dr.
Randall, assistant to Dr. D. D. Owens, in charge of the geological
survey of Wisconsin. The discovery of ore in 1848 was fully described
in Dr. Owen's report of 1852, stating the ore to be in the form of a
stratified belt about 300 yards wide, dipping to the northwest, with
its outcrop appearing along the summit of a mountain range.
Captain N. D. Moore shipped ore to Milwaukee from large deposits
of soft brown hematite found by him in 1880. In 1883 explorers from
the old ranges worked their way over to the Indian reservation near
Ashland, Wisconsin. Their prospecting south of the present city
of Bessemer laid bare the situation of the since far-famed Colby
mine. Not long after the discovery of this mine an ''option" for
a lease was taken out by Mr. A. Laufear Norrie, of New York City,
upon land which his men opened up and proved to be one of the most
wonderful underground producers that the country has ever known.
The first regular shipments from this range began in 1884 with one
cargo of 1022 tons from the Colby mine, followed by 119,800 long tons
in 1885 from eight producing' mines, the next season witnessed a leap
to 747,589 tons from twenty-one mines. ,
As on the Marquette and Gogebic ranges, the first ore deposits
on the Vermillion were announced by the state geologist, Mr. H. H.
Eames,who made note of its presence in 18(36. In 1875 explorers under
direction of Mr. Stuntz, of Duluth, found a seam of ore thirteen feet
wide of hematite so hard that it was almost impossible to break it
with the tools then available. This seam, which had been cut by
touching across the ore formation, ultimately proved to be that oper-
ated by the Minnesota Iron Company. Five years later systematic
exploration was taken up. The range had no great development
however until the Duluth and Iron Range railroad was built in 1884.
This road passed into the control of the Minnesota Iron Company
two years later, under whose superintendent, Mr. D. H. Bacon, now
of the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company, additional dis-
coveries were made and the mines rapily developed.
On the Mesaba, the newest and at the same time the most re-
markable of the ranges, ore was noticed as early as 1850. Yet the
earliest explorers were for several years greatly, disappointed, many
uniting in condeming the district entirely, owing to the fact that all
ore found was lean or blended with jasper. Another disturbing pecu-
liarity of the field was the fact that the deposits were very flat,
while the lenses of the old ranges stood at a very high angle to the
horizon. Soft hematite was found in 1890 on the site of the Moun-
tain Iron mine. Shortly afterwards the Biwabik, Cincinnati, Hale
and others were opened. At the Biwabik the much famed steam
shovel operations of this range were inaugurated. The panic of 1893
coming on at this time stopped all development on the range, not,
however, before it had been proved that the ore here could be handled
easily with steam shovels.

It is seen that last year the enormous figure of twenty millions
total tonnage was reached. It is hard to appreciate this when read-
ing the mere bare figures. A common size of ore car holds twenty
tons. Loaded into such cars this amount of ore would fill one million
of them, which running day and night in one continuous train at
twenty miles per hour would take two weeks to pass a given point. If
this ore were made into steel rails weighing sixty pounds to the yard
it would replace half the metal on every railroad in the United States,
and would lay a four-track railway around the globe at the equator.
While it is not the province of this paper to discuss the geology
of the district it may be stated that almost all the ores are hematites,
either anhydrous (specular) or hydrated (limonite). Magnetites are
quite rare, being found at the Republic mine on the Marquette range
and mixed, in small quantity, with certain Mesaba ores. All the ore
beds, deposits or lenses occur within the limits of what has been known
as the Huronian series of rocks, which term included all rocks lying
between the Laurentian below it and the Cambrian, or earliest fossil-
iferous rocks, above. The deposits are usually found upon the imper
vious bedrock of diorite or quart/.ite underlaid by green schist or
granite, down to which they had leached from the strata above.
Above the ore there usually occurs surface drifts in the Minnesota
mines, and blue or black slate in those of Michigan and Wisconsin-
The miners term the bedrock the "footwall," while the slates, or
"soaprock," overlying the ore, constitute the "hanging wall," both
'terms being commonly shortened to "the foot," and " the hanging"
respectively. On the Menominee range the rocks possess the pecu-
liarity of having the Silurian limestone overlying the Huronian series.
To the north of the range is a band of dolomitic limestone, much
eroded by glacial action, the remnants of which latter lie on the


Huronian rocks to'which they have been carried. The Menominee
range is the only one where any fossilif erous remains have been found,
these being very rare. One result of this limestone formation is the
exceedingly wet nature of the majority of mines opened here. All
limestone regions have been noted for underground caverns and pas-
sages of great length. The only relieving feature of these limestone
beds is that they lie at a sharp angle to the horizon. If tliey were
flat as in the Joplin zinc district of Missouri the flow of water would
be prohibitive, even now being a heavy item of expense.
The first ore discovered was in the nature of an outcropping on
the surface, leading the discoverers to believe that they had no real
mining to do and that their only labor would be to break the ore and
load it into cars. As a result the first mining operations were carried
on in huge open pits, with the aid of derricks, much after the manner
of quarrying building stones. These large pits on the Marquette
range in particular are today one of the sights shown to visitors. As
an instance of the ignorance of the true nature of the ore formation
may be cited the famous litigation for the possession of Jasper Knob
in Tshpening, which was believed to be a veritable mountain of iron.
After several thousands of dollars had been spent the legal owners
began work upon their supposed bonanza. A bitter and costly expe-
rience was in truth theirs, for this "'Knob," or hill, proved to be a
great mass of jasper covered with a very thin skin of iron ore, which
even today draws the attention of visitors by its dark blue colors
sparking in the sunlight.
With the passing of time, however, came a better understanding
of the nature of the problems to be dealt with, so that now the win-
ning of the ore is attacked in a truly scientific manner. The meth-
ods used in many places are largely patterned after those of England,
the Cornish miners being very prominent in the working of the Lake
Superior mines. All the methods in use may be divided into four dis-
tinct systems, viz, overhead stoping, caving, milling and steam shov-
elling.
In " overhead stoping," after the situation of the ore deposit has
been proven by the diamond drill, the usual plan is to sink a slanting
shaft in f ootrock, following the dip. Ordinarily the shaft is of oblong
section, partitioned into two hoisting ways and a third way containing
the ladder and piping to the pumps and air drills. When the shaft
has reached a depth of about 05 feet a drift (as the galleries or
headings are usually termed) is driven horizontally across the deposit.
About the center of the deposit another drift is driven longitudinally
along the deposit for about twenty-four feet. Ore is then broken out
sideways and upwards, across the lense, falling to the original level,
and then being conveyed to the shaft. In this manner a "room''
about 24 feet wide, extending to the soil or rock capping above and
equal in length to the width of the deposit, is cut out, the workings
being followed by timber scaffolding throughout, except in such rare


cases as when the hanging rock is strong enough to stand of itself.
The original central longitudinal drift is now driven through 24 feet
of ore to form a pillar and then 24 feet further to start the next room.
This room is worked out in like manner as the first and the cavity
supported by timbers as before. When this room, or rather, when
all the rooms on the level have been worked out the timber is caused
to collapse and the surface allowed to fall in, no effort being made to
recover the timber. The intermediate pillars are then taken by
some modification of the caving system. Often the central drift is
driven for some distance and several rooms started at once, leaving
their intermediate pillars. When the level has been worked out, the
shaft is sunk about 65 feet further and a second slice on the
deposit started in the same manner as before. This system is often
known as the " rooming " plan.
As a modification of the overhead stoning system may be men-
tioned the plan for a long time employed at the Aragon Mine on the
Menominee Range. The deposit here was overlaid with a deep bed of
quicksand which seemed to be fairly seeping with the waters from
several adjoining lakes. As a result the mine was exceedingly wet,
and this combined with the soft nature of the ore rendered the pil-
lars excessively weak and friable. For some time the mine looked
like a hopeless problem and that it was ever worked at all is a great
credit to the perseverance and ingenuity of its first superintendent,
Mr. Per Larsson. Near the mine was a large hill of clear sand. As
Mr. Larsson had made a deep study of European filling systems it
occurred to him to run this sand into the mine and fill up each room
as fast as it was worked out. This was done, the sand men keeping
only two or three sets of scaffolding or about 14 or 21 feet below the
miners. The dry sand absorbed the water and packed every nook and
corner. When the pillars were taken out by overhead stoping, the
sand held remarkably well and very little trouble was experienced,
the pillar cavities being also filled with sand. The only great trouble
experienced was in places where the flow of water was very heavy
and washed the sand out into the main drifts. Although caving has
superseded filling, credit must be given to the latter as the first plan
to solve the hard problems that this mine offered.
The caving system, second in mention, last in adoption, is rapidly
becoming the accepted plan for mining the soft ores as usually found on
the older ranges. When the location of the ore body has been proven
by the diamond drill, one or two shafts are sunk in the adjacent rock
to a depth of about 100 feet, being vertical or inclined as the judg-
ment of the mining captain directs, according to the tilt of the ore
lense. From the shaft, or shafts, drifts are driven into the ore body
and connected. At regular intervals of, say, 25 feet, timber rises, 7
feet by 6 feet 3 inches are worked upward to the top of the ore body
and joined, for safety and ventilation The ore is now systematically
sliced out to the edges of the formation, seven feet in height being


worked out, the rock capping being supported by timber. When these
timbers show signs of distress, or if still standing when the seven-foot
slice has been cut across the ore body, they are blasted away and the
surface allowed to fall in to that extent, the floor being previously
covered with rough timbers to form a good roof for the next slice.
Not infrequently the ground is permitted to cave before the slice has
been completed, the worked out cavities coming in almost as soon as
excavated, so that sometimes miners may still be working on the
same slice which has caved within thirty or forty feet of them. The
timbered rises are divided into two compartments, a ladder way and an
ore chute, or "mill," as it is locally termed, "milling the ore down"
being to run it through the chute. From the mill it falls into cars on the
level below and is transported to the shaft and hoisted to the surface.
By successive stages all the ore above the level driven from the'shaft
is thus worked out and the ground permitted to cave in after each
slice. In the meantime the shaft has been sunk a further 100 feet and
the "second level" started with its various rises and prepared for
working as above. The first level is then abandoned and mining con-
tinued on the second. As the ore is worked out an immense pit is
formed by the gradual caving of the surface, plainly showing the
great quantity of ore taken.
The advantages of caving over overhead stopingare many, the two
chief ones being the lesser amount of timber required and the greater
safety of the plans. The timber is light, of a temporary character,
just sufficient to hold the ground until the miners can withdraw to a
new working, whereas in the stoping method it is necessary to use
large quantities of massive framed timbers. At first sight caving
seems the more dangerous, although in reality it is the safer,
despite the fact that it took many years of practice to convince the
stubbornly prejudiced miners of this fact. When the ore caves in
the caving system it falls only seven feet, as compared with many
times this in the stoping system. As a result the falls of ore are
confined to small areas and do not occur with resounding crash and
attendant catastrophe as would be the case if a large room should
give way and collapse. The miners work on solid foot ground and not
upon scaffoldings of timber many sets high, which need constant and
vigilant inspection to insure them against weakness due to rotting. If
nothing else, this matter of the heavy timber renewals in the old
mines would cause the choice of the caving system in future work,
for the once abundant forests around the mines are no longer stand-
ing and timber is quite expensive.
The milling system is not used to a large extent, being princi-
pally employed where the overburden of rock and soil is very light
and the ore yet so situated that it must be hoisted some distance.
The plan is much like the caving system except that the major part
of the work is carried on in the open air. Proceeding as previously
mentioned, shafts are sunk and drifts driven in the ore body. The

soil and rock is removed from the top of the ore so that when the
rises are worked up they end in the open air. The ore is dug out and
shovelled down the mills in the rises, falling into cars on the level
below, transported to the shaft and hoisted to the surface. Sometimes
when the ore is a little hard, blasts are fired, which send the ore down
in great quantities. There is this advantage to the milling system
that it requires very little timber at all, only enough being used to
line the main drifts and rises. Furthermore it is quite safe as the
majority of miners work in the open air with no overhanging roof of
ore or rock.
Of all the systems of mining mentioned, however, steam-shovell-
ing is the cheapest and safest. It is practically applicable only to
the Mesaba range where the ore bodies are of vast extent, so soft
that they resemble earth rather than rock, lying very flat with
scarcely any soil above them. While steamshovelling has been used
with success in a few instances on the old ranges, still it is pre-emi-
nently the Mesaba method. So marked has its success here been that
it is scarcely to be wondered at that old range operators were fright-
ened when they heard the marvelous stories of the richest and purest
ores imaginable, "simply scooped off the earth into ore cars,'* at no
cost at all for mining. Many ridiculed the idea that this could con-
tinue for more than a few months or that the ore was of any value.
At the same time Mesaba men were extravagant beyond veracity in
their enthusiasm over the new finds. Today finds both opinions modi-
fied, and the Mesaba range, while requiring careful, systematic mining
like any other, still acknowledged to be the most wonderful of the
rich Lake Superior ranges.
In practice a trench is usually cut longitudinally across the
deposit to drain the surface water, a pumping equipment becoming
necessay as the trench deepens. "Stripping" or removing the surface
soil then follows. Railroad tracks are laid across the deposit parallel
to the drainage trench and the steam shovel begins to lift the ore into
the cars rapidly switched past it in train lots. New trains of empties
are constantly being made up, to follow those tilled in order to prevent
any delay to the shovel operators in waiting for cars. A common
type of shovel used weighs 92 tons, costing about $9,000. It has three
separate pairs of cylinders, steam supply being furnished by a verti-
cal tubular boiler. The bucket can take as many as five tons at a
stroke, so it is not uncommon to see a twenty-five ton car filled by six
to eight strokes. The ore is systematically worked out in terraces,
the drainage trench forming the lowest. Blasting is frequently nec-
essary to dislodge the firmer ores.
While it is true that the development of the Mesaba has caused
a fall in the price of ore, nevertheless the extravagant claims of
those who said that nearly all the old range mines would 3hut down
in consequence of the advent of a new arrival have not been borne
out. One very important reason is that the use of Mesaba ore has


created a demand for old range ores to form a mixture with them.
The Mesaba ores are so fine grained and compact in their nature that
in the furnace they have a tendency to settle and pack, preventing'
the escape of gases. Many disastrous explosions have occurred as
the result of trying to use too large a proportion of Mesaba ores in
the mixture. Experience has shown that not over 50 per cent, can
safely be used, the usual proportion being from 25 to 40 per cent. As
a result of this, furnace men began to seek the lumpier old range ores.
Other qualities of the old range ores were also found to be valuable,
particularly the low grade ores, low in phosphorus and high in silica,
a necessary constituent in which Mesaba ores are deficient. Many
old and abandoned mines have been reopened for the high silica ores
that they contain, carrying only 35 to 45 per cent, of iron, yet so low
in phosphorus that they made Bessemer ores of Messaba ores not
quite within the limit, when mixed with them. These ores are known
as " sweeteners" for the more indiscriminately mined Mesaba ores.
It must not be understood that all the Mesaba ores are being
mined by the steam shovel. Stripping in many cases has proven so
expensive that underground work has finally been decided upon. The
careful mining of the old ranges where the engineer precedes the
miners and close on the heels of the latter come the chemist and his
samplers, produces a very carefully graded ore. Mining by shovel is
cheap, but the ores have to be taken as they are found and the grades
thus produced are cheapened in quality as well as in price. For these
reasons steam shoveling is profitably only in the special case, not
everywhere.
Sampling and analyzing the ores has been given thorough atten-
tion, every mine of any size having its own chemical laboratory and
trained manipulators, while smaller properties depend upon private
chemists. Usually samples are taken at three places, underground
from the faces of the workings, from the skips as they arrive at the
surface and from the loaded cars, constituting respectively "stope,"
"skip," and " car samples." The frequency of underground sampling
depends upon the proven uniformity of the deposit, some mines
requiring samples for every " set," or block of ore seven feet square,
while others do not need to be sampled more than once in forty or
fifty feet. Samples are taken from every skip and car and mixed in
lots, such as skip samples for each shift, and car samples for every
ten cars. The "sample pickers" are a part of the regular force at
every mine. The final samples upon which the ore is sold are taken
from the cargos when unloaded at lower lake ports. The checking
of all these samples insures accuracy. While some ores are so vari-
able in their constituents that exact grading becomes difficult, it is
generally found that the season's average of the mine chemists very
closely tallies with that of the lower lake chemists.
The two elements which commonly determine the value of the
ore are iron and phosphorus, the latter perhaps the most important.


LAKE SUPERIOR IRON ORE MINES. 67
■»NI
The maximum percentage of iron in the hematites (PejOj) commonly
mined is a little over 70 per cent., which should be borne in mind when
reading of discoveries of iron ore nearly 95 per cent, pure, etc. The
somewhat rare magnetites may contain as high as 72 per cent, of
iron and for that reason were once the standard of comparison for
all the other ores. The injurious effects of phosphorus on wrought
iron and steel are well known, imparting coarsely crystalline struc-
ture to the metal, diminishing the strength and rendering it cold
short. In the process of making steel as invented by Sir Henry Bes-
semer, the converter is lined with acid material termed ganister. This
material has no influence on the phosphorus, so that after the blow
the amount present is practically as large as before. This necessi-
tates the employment of ores free from the objectionable element.
Hence came to be known as Bessemer ores those containing very small
amounts of phosphorous, the higher the grade and the better the
price obtained the lower the amount of phosphorus carried, provided
the iron contents also remained large. It is not sharply decided what
shall constitute a Bessemer ore, a common specification being an ore
not over .045 per cent, in phosphorus, not less than 63 per cent, in iron
and not more than 10 per cent in moisture. Chemical analysis is
based on the sample dried at 212° Fahrenheit. Each mine generally
has several grades of ore denominated by arbitrary local appella-
tions, classed according to the percentage of iron and phosphorus
carried.
Hence the great majority of samples are worked for iron and
phosphorous only, and many, particularly the mine samples, for phos-
phorus alone. Local peculiarities of the ore may determine special
analyses, such as for manganese or silica where the amount of these
elements is so large as to add a certain value to the ore because of
their presence. From every car sample is weighed out a certain
definite amount in proportion to the tonnage represented and set aside
to form part of a ''season's average sample." This average sample
is usually well worked out for iron, phosphorus, manganese, sulphur,
silicon, calcium, magnesium, etc., such an analysis being known as a
"complete.''
A notable feature in regard to many mines is the extension of
mechanical power to underground haulage, replacing men and mules
with great success. At the Cleveland-Cliffs, Lake Shaft and the
Lake Angeline mine on the Marquette range and the Norrie mine on
the Gogebic are electric haulage systems. The current is generated
on the surface and sent underground at 550 volts to a trolley wire sus-
pended in the drifts from protecting boards to keep off the moisture,
return being made by the rails. Haulage, or "tramming," by this
method has many advantages over hand work. The chief one is that
the motor hauls long trains at a very high speed, permitting the use
of long drifts and saving the cost of sinking new shafts as the miners
work away from their original starting point. The skip is kept in
r


almost constant service, a train of loaded cars always standing at
the shaft mouth on the working- level. In fact, hoisting has become
so rapid that it has necessitated the installation of electric trams on
the surface also to take care of the enormous daily tonnage. At the
new " B " shaft of the Norrie mine, the equipment is so planned that
they can raise over half a million tons per year through the one shaft.
The Chapin mine and others on the Menominee range use wire
rope haulage. The Aragon mine at Norway on the same range uses
compressed air, the only one in the entire district to do so. A spe-
cial compressor on the surface sends the air into the'mine at a pressure
of 800 pounds per square inch. The locomotives carry large steel
tanks in which the air is stored, about a mirrute and a quarter being
required to charge for a trip of one-half mile. By means of reduc-
ing valves the air is delivered to the engines at a pressure under 125
pounds. At present five or six cars are hauled at a time. The system
works very satisfactorily and has solved one of the many problems of
the Aragon. The ore formation here is very long and narrow except
in the middle where it widens out. A shaft in the ore body, sunk at
great expense, was lost by the coming together of the ore pillars.
The present hoisting shaft, TOO feet distant from the main ore body, is
sunk in solid jasper and therefore quite permanent. The long trams
involved, for a time threatened to overcome all advantages of a per-
manent shaft. The installation of the compressed air haulage sys-
tem completely met the exigency.
On the Marquette range the richest mines are on the edge of
Lake Angeline, three companies, the Lake Superior, the Cleveland-
Cliffs and the Pittsburg and Lake Angeline, owning the adjoining
land and the lake basin. The main ore deposits were under the lake
and for several years miners worked underneath the waters. The
presence of this lake was a constant menace and a source of much
anxiety to the mine managements. Finally it was deemed advisable
to pump out this lake, huge though the job appeared to be. For it
must be borne in mind that this lake covered an area of 103 acres,
being nearly 50 feet deep in the middle, and was estimated to have
contained over a billion gallons of water. The outlet was lowered
about six feet, as much as the topography of the country would allow.
A large scow was built and moored near the center of the lake, a
launder being built out on piles to it. On this scow were placed the
boilers and centrifugal pumps. The work required six months for
its completion. The end of this time found an unexpected trouble
remaining in the presence of mud, from six to twenty feet in depth,
too thick to pump and to thin to shovel. It has been the cause
of several bad scares, notably when at times in the caving system
employed at the Cleveland Lake Shaft the rock capping broke
through and the mud forced itself into the mine, running with con-
siderable freedom, and compelling the miners to wade through it
waist deep. There is no danger to the men as it runs slowly, but


when it starts to come the men leave for there is no glory in being
drowned in mud. At present it is slowly drying up and is now cov-
ered by a forest of small poplars, which may perhaps solve the prob-
lem. At any rate, the trouble with the mud is not to be compared
with the danger formerly connected with the presence of the water.
The completeness of the organization of the United States Steel
Company is shown in the manner in which control has been extended
over the bases of supply, the iron mines. The Oliver Mining Com-
pany is the corporate name by which this branch of the mammoth
industrial combination is managed. The progress of this corporation
as it gradually absorbed the great mines of this district has natur-
ally been looked upon with the trepidation, which as yet, however,
has proved unfounded. Probably the only independent property of
any great size at present is the Cleveland-Cliffs Company, operating
in Marquette County, and having furnaces at Gladstone and Mar-
quette, and even this company is rumored to be under option to the
Oliver Mining Company. Contrary to the expectations of a few
frightened ones, the formation of this company has proved of great
benefit to the entire district. For only a company with strong coffers
could carry on the heavy systematic explorations that are in pro-
gress on all the various ranges. Many small properties once thought
almost worthless have been proved up and bought at good prices by
this company. Many other benefits have accrued, which lack of
space prevents recounting. It is true, to be sure, that power has
been concentrated and whether for good or evil depends upon the
men in control.
That the Lake Superior fields have been thus recognized by the
United States Steel Company is hut one tribute to their greatness.
We cannot go on mining ore from the same spot forever, yet it is
not difficult to see that these fields are far from having reached their
zenith in production. Last year saw the almost inconceivable amount
of twenty million tons produced. There are many today of the most
experienced judgment who predict that in ten years this amount will
be doubled.
As they are of such extent then, the Lake Superior iron ore fields
will for many years exercise a most vital influence on the world's iron-
making industry, for this reason well deserving study from both
industrial and economic standpoints.


IMPROVEMENTS MADE IN HEATING AND VENTILATING
PLANTS IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF
DETROIT SINCE 1898.
RALPH COLLAMORE, '97.
The object of this article is to give some idea of the improve-
ments made in the arrangement of the apparatus in the "forced
blast" system of heating and ventilating as installed in the public
schools of Detroit during the past few years. While these improve-
ments have not changed the original scheme of the system, they
have done much to simplify both the handling and the-arrangement
of the apparatus. The effect of these improvements has been to
make the recent plants equal \o the best of their kind anywhere in
the United States. These results have not been attained at a single
bound but are the result of close observation and a desire to improve
wherever possible.
Not long ago an architect from the State of Washington came
to Detroit while on a tour of inspection. He had examined the heat-
ing and ventilating plants in the schools of St. Louis, Chicago, New
York and several other cities, but after inspecting the plant in the
Gillies School of this city, he said that it was the best he had seen.
He was sent east by the Board of Education of his home city to get
the best ideas concerning the arrangement of school buildings and
the methods used to heat and ventilate them, and he said that he
would recommend for adoption as a heating system the arrangement
he found in the above named school. Such comments as these have
led the engineers for the Board of Education of Detroit to feel
that they are right in assuming that the plants have kept pace with
the times.
A brief description of the "forced blast" system as it existed in
the schools in 1897 had best be given here.
The plant itself consisted of a boiler, engine, steel plate fan,
pump and receiver, tempering coils, main heating coils, traps for
returns, galvanized iron ducts for carrying the air from the fan to
the vertical flues leading to the rooms, and several other smaller
pieces of apparatus. The fresh air was usually admitted through
basement windows or special openings near the ground level, drawn
through the tempering coils to the fan and delivered by the fan
through the heating coils into the main distributing duct, and from
the main distributing duct to the vertical flues leading to the various
rooms where the air was delivered about seven feet from the floor.
Vent openings placed immediately under the fresh air openings in


the rooms carried the air into the attic and from there it passed to
the outer air through a cupola. The main steam line from the
boiler fed the engine, pump, main heating coils and part of the tem-
pering coils. The boiler pressure was usually 20 to 25 pounds. The
exhaust line from the engine and pump fed one or more sections of the
tempering coils and the direct radiation in the halls and entrances.
This line was also connected to the main steam line through a reduc-
ing pressure valve and a back pressure valve in the line provided for
the adjustment of the pressure, which was usually carried at three
pounds. The returns from the heating and tempering coils fed with
live steam, from the tempering coils fed with exhaust steam and
from the direct radiation were separately trapped into an open
receiver and from the receiver pumped back into the boiler.
The fan was as a rule single, top horizontal discharge and was
belted to the engine. The fact that a single discharge fan was used
sometimes made the distance from the fan to the vertical Hues very
great. The heating coils were by-passed so that the tempered air
could pass around them. The main distributing duct consisted in
reality of two ducts one above the other, the top one carrying hot air
and the lower one tempered air to the various vertical flues. Mixing
dampers were placed at the bottom of the vertical flues for the pur-
pose of regulating the temperature of the air. This main distrib-
uting duct was frequently ten or twelve feet wide at the fan, being
reduced, however, as branches were taken off. In order to make the
air distribute properly, numerous deflectors were installed, but owing
to the fact that air under motion is often unruly it was frequently
necessary to install additional deflectors after the plant was com-
pleted.
(1) The first change made in the arrangement as described above
was to discard the unwieldly distributing duct and to substitute in its
place individual ducts running from the fan direct to the vertical
flues. Mixing and volume dampers were placed in these ducts where
the ducts left the plenum chamber at the fan. This change accom-
plished several results: 1st. Less material was required for ducts;
2d. The individual ducts could be better supported than one large
duct; 3d. The air supply to the rooms could be positively controlled
at the fan; 4th. The mixing and volume dampers were all in one
place and could be easily controlled by the engineer in charge of the
plant.
(2) The second change was to substitute a double top horizontal
discharge fan in place of the single discharge fan wherever possi-
ble and thus be able to locate the fan at the center of distribution.
The effect of this arrangement was also to shorten the distance
between the fan and the vertical flues.
(3) Extending the engine shaft and placing the fan wheel on it,
at the same time providing an outboard bearing for this shaft so
that the fan wheel would be independent of the fan casing. This


change made the plant more compact and eliminated one item of
repair, namely, the belt, at the same time lessening the chance of
communicating sound to the rooms.
(4) A definite practice was determined upon regarding the pro-
portioning of heating surface in the heating and tempering coils and
also on velocities of air to be used. It was determined to place five-
eighths of the total heating surface in the heating coils and three-
eighths in the tempering coils, and this division has been very satis-
factory. There has also been a tendency to reduce the velocity of
the air and at present the following velocities are used: Fresh air
duct, 800 f. p. m.: through tempering and heating coils, 1200 to 1500
f. p. m.: in ducts, 750 f. p. m.; in flues, 400 f. p. m.: and through heat
and vent openings, 300 f. p. m. The general effect of reducing veloci-
ties has been to make the plants easier to handle and more responsive
to adjustments.
(5) The next step was to place the heating and tempering coils
and direct radiation all on one system and bring the returns back to
the receiver without the use of traps. The exhaust line was con-
nected into this low pressure line and any deficiency of steam was
supplied through a reducing pressure valve. The receiver was pro-
vided with an overflow pipe which had a water seal. This seal was
frequently blown out so the overflow pipe was abandoned and an equal-
izing pipe between the receiver and the low pressure line was substi-
tuted in its place. This last arrangement has proved very satisfac-
tory.
About this same time the coils which were placed in the vent flues
to the toilet rooms to insure a positive flow of air and which had up to
this time been fed from the low pressure system,were connected to an
independent system operating at boiler pressure and returning direct
to the boiler, so that whenever there is any pressure on the boiler these
coils will operate whether the plant is in operation or not.
(0) The next step was a very important one and consisted in
changing the method of introducing the fresh air into the buildings.
As mentioned before, up to this time the fresh air had been introduced
at or near the ground level. It was now changed so that the air
entered the system under the eaves of the building and was taken
down a special flue to the tempering coils in the basement. In the
attic a damper was placed in this flue which was arranged to admit
the air either from the outside or from the attic. This has made it
possible to re-circulate the air before the opening of school, and
thereby save considerable coal and time in warming the rooms. After
school commences the damper is set to allow the air to come in from
the outside. This damper is operated from the basement and is easily
controlled. These advantages are those viewed from an engineering
standpoint, but it can readily be seen that it has improved the sani-
tary conditions.
(7) Automatic stokers and automatic heat regulating appara-


tus were introduced at about the same time. The automatic stokers
have made it possible to burn a cheap grade of coal, prevented
smoke and saved the engineer's time. So far only two kinds of stok-
ers have been used:—the Murphy and the Detroit. Automatic heat
regulation has greatly simplified the operation of plants by placing
the temperature of the air entering the school rooms beyond the con-
trol of the teacher. It has also made it unnecessary for the engineer
to be constantly adjusting the mixing dampers, and in fact relieved
all parties of responsibility regarding the temperature of the school
rooms. These systems have been installed under a guarantee that the
temperature of the rooms shall not vary over two degrees, and the
guarantee has in general been fulfilled. There are two systems in
use at the present time:—the Johnson and the Powers.
The next step in the direction of automatic control will prob-
ably be.the " Humidostat" and "Humidifier", apparatus for controll-
ing the humidity of the air entering the rooms of the building. The
humidity of the air in the school rooms is always less than that of the
outside air, due to the fact that the air in passing through the tem-
pering and heating coils is expanded and consequently the proportion
of moisture per cubic foot reduced. The apparatus mentioned above
is guaranteed to maintain a constant humidity in the rooms indepen-
dent of the humidity of the outside air. This apparatus is manufac-
tured by the Johnson Electric Service Co. of Milwaukee. It is inter-
esting to note that a humidity as low as six per cent, has been found
in some of the old schools, whereas it should be between fifty per cent,
and seventy per cent.
It is interesting to note what the present improvements mean to
engineers in charge. In the schools heated by furnaces and in some
of the old steam-heated schools it is not considered unusual for the
engineer to start his plant at three or four o'clock in the morning in
severe weather, but the engineer in charge of the "up to date" plant
considers it a hardship if he has to start his plant before six o'clock,
and in some cases it has not been found necessary to start up before
half-past six or seven.
In designing a plant the consulting engineer must first have the
approval of the Board of Education; he then finds out that the prin-
cipal of the school has to be satisfied, but after that he finds that
there is an engineer who is to operate the plant and that although
it is comparatively easy to satisfy the Board of Education and the
principal the engineer in charge is the one who demands the
most and it is for him primarily that the operation must be made as
simple and easy as possible. But it must not be imagined that the
engineer in charge has an easy time for he has numerous demands
made on his time by both principal and teachers, and in order to
please every one must be somewhat of a diplomat.
(8) In view of the fact that the Public Lighting Commission fur-
nishes the current, without charge, to public buildings, motors have
6


been used wherever possible to drive the fans This has increased
the first cost of the plant, but lessened the operating expenses. The
steam piping with this arrangement is very simple since it is possible
to have only one low pressure system operating at boiler pressure to
feed both indirect and direct radiation. When this system is used an
exhaust fan, electrically driven, is used to take the air out of the
toilet rooms, thus assuring positive ventilation of these rooms. This
air is exhausted directly to the atmosphere so that the balance of the
system is not contaminated. Another advantage of this type of plant
is the fact that in mild weather the fans can be operated without
getting up steam, thus affecting a considerable saving in fuel.
The Eastern High School, erected in 1900, has its own electric
plant. This building is divided into three wings and has a separate
fan for each wing, all fans being driven by motors. The toilet rooms
and chemical laboratory each have an exhaust fan system for remov-
ing the air. Besides the five motors there are about 1400 electric
lights in the building. The advantages of this arrangement are
numerous, long lines of steam piping are avoided, any wing may be
heated independently, and the whole plant can be controlled from the
engine room. When this building is furnished with throw over ser-
vice to the Public Lighting Commission's mains it will be as com
plete an equipment as could be desired.
(it) Recently numerous complaints have been made that oil has
found its way into the boilers. Whether this has been due to poor
separation in the oil separator on the exhaust line from the engine,
or to a poor grade of cylinder oil has not yet been definitely deter-
mined, in any case it is probably impossible to eliminate all the oil
from the exhaust steam even with the best of apparatus. However,
in order to avoid the possibility of any further trouble from this
source, the exhaust line has been connected into one or more sections
of the heating coils instead of into the low pressure line and the
returns from these coils are trapped into the sewer. This avoids any
possibility of oil getting into the boiler but at the same time slightly
increases the cost of operation.
(10) From some of the schools complaints have been made that
the air returning along the floors to the vent flues caused a draught
and gave the pupils cold feet. This was especially true where there
was but one vent outlet in the room situated immediately under the
heat opening. Whenever possible several vent opening are provided,
usually by taking off about six inches from the bottoms of the doors
leading to the cloak rooms, the vent flue proper leading from these
rooms. But in order to overcome this objection completely it is pur.
posed to run one or two rows of steam pipe under the windows in order
to take the chill off of the air as it starts to return to the vent open-
ings. It would seem that this would accomplish the purpose but that
can be better determined after the experiment has been tried.
(11) In the general improvement the boilers have not escaped


notice. For a long time it was customary to specify lap joints for
the horizontal seams, but for the past two years butt joints and butt
straps have been used for the horizontal seams. These butt joints
are designed according to the recommendation of the Hartford Boiler
Insurance Company, and surely make a better design than the lap
joint. The importance of this part of boiler design has been brought
prominently before the notice of the public since the explosion of
the boiler in the Pemberthy Injector Works. The failure of this
boiler evidently occurred along the horizontal seam which was in this
case a lap joint. Other conditions probably helped cause the explo-
sion, but undoubtedly the constant bending of the plate at this seam
was the real cause of weakness. The steam pressure carried on the
boilers in the schools is rarely over 25 pounds, but where so many
lives depend on the design of this piece of apparatus, too much
care cannot be taken to have the design as nearly perfect as pos-
sible.
Many other improvements have been made in matters of detail,
such as connections to heating coils, devices for adjusting volume
dampers, improving blow-off connections to boiler, providing funnels
with drain pipe for carrying off water from gauge cocks on water
column, connecting drip opening from safety valve to drip line, etc.,
all of which have helped to make the plant complete in matters of
detail.
During the summer of 1899, three furnace gravity heating sys-
tems were removed and replaced by the forced blast systems. In
the schools where this has been done there has been a marked
improvement in the general health of the scholars and in scholar-
ship. This is probably due to the fact that the proper amount of air
is being furnished per pupil, in some cases 'M cubic feet per minute per
pupil, and also to the freedom of the air from impurities. The old
furnace systems did not as a rule furnish sufficient air and conse-
quently the air became contaminated by the pupils. How great has
been the improvement in this direction was made evident in a paper
read before the Detroit Engineering Society by Mr. A. B. Raymond,
Sanitary Engineer for the Health Board. He cited as an example of
a furnace heated school a room in which 400 to 600 cubic feet of air
per hour was supplied per pupil (1800 cubic feet of air per hour per
pupil is the minimum amount supplied in properly designed plants)
with from 6.4 to 10.3 parts of carbon dioxide to 10,000 parts of air
and as an example of a "forced blast" system a room in which 1400
to 2000 cubic feet of air was supplied per hour with from 6.6 to 6.9
parts of carbon dioxide. This latter system was not one of the most
recent, but similar to that first described above. A good authority
has given the following classification for air according to the amounts
of carbon dioxide present:—Good, below seven parts in 10,000; fair,
from seven to nine parts in 10,000: bad, above nine in 10,000. Prom
this classification it will be seen that the air with the "forced blast"


system is decidedly better than that furnished by the furnace gravity
system. Carbon dioxide itself is probably not the dangerous part of
respired air but it is believed to be an index of the amount of impur-
ity in the air. Mr.-Raymond found the best results in the Eastern
High and Gillies schools, two of the most recent schools, in which
only five parts of carbon dioxide in 10,000 were found.
The writer has probably presumed somewhat on the knowledge of
the readers concerning the matters touched upon, but to go further
into details would probably be tiresome. It would seem that the
development of the heating systems has been slow, but this is usu-
ally the case where permanent progress is made. Attention to
details, earnest thought and careful planning have been the main
factors in bringing the plants to their present degree of perfection.
STEAM STAMP FOUNDATIONS AT THE ISLE ROYALE COP-
PER COMPANY'S STAMP MILL.
A. L. BURGAN, '95-'9fi, SUPT. TAMARACK AND OSCEOLA STAMP MILLS.
The location of the Isle Royale Stamp Mill was ideal in all
respects save one. The formation there is dry sand with occasional
layers of gravel to a depth of 75 feet, where there is a sandstone bed.
The serious problem was to build foundations that would withstand
the jar caused by stamps with striking parts weighing three tons,
striking at a velocity of twenty feet per second and one hundred
blows per minute.
With two exceptions the mills in this section have locations
where there is a sandstone formation within a few feet of the sur-
face, making it a comparatively easy matter to place foundations
equal to the requirements. These are made about fourteen feet deep
and twenty feet square, with concrete and timber. In the case of
one of the exceptions noted, this concrete and timber was started on
sand, and was far from a success. In the other case piles were first
driven in the sand, about thirty inches between centers, and the bed of
concrete and timber placed on these. I understand this is not considered
an entire success. The problem for the management of the Isle Royale
Copper Company was then to devise some method which would of a
certainty be successful. The method adopted was that of sinking for
each stamp a steel tube twelve feet in diameter to the sandstone
seventy-five feet below, the tubes to end about fifteen feet below the
foundation level and to be filled with concrete. From the top of the
tube the foundation was carried up twenty feet square with concrete,
and capped with three courses of oak timbers, crossed. The base of
the anvil blocks would be entirely over the tubes, while the enlarged


top of the foundation gives ample support for the stamp frame. As
superintendent of the mill, this work was under rny charge. The tubes
were furnished in six foot sections, three-eights inches thick, by the
Wisconsin Bridge and Iron Company of Milwaukee.
The positions of the tubes were located, and two twelve feet sec-
tions placed together in position, then workmen began excavation in
the tube, shoveling into buckets which were hoisted by means of a
steam hoist and derrick. The weight of the tube was sufficient to
sink it for the first six feet, beyond this extra weights were placed
on top until it was found that this made the tubes top-heavy. It was
also impossible to keep the tubes plumb with this arrangement. It
was found that although the tubes had heavy angle iron bracing
bands every twelve feet, the crushing strains caused the plates to
bulge in places, making it all the harder to force them down. To over-
come both difficulties, about three feet from the bottom of the tube
on a heavy angle iron a brick wall was begun, gradually thickening
until it was eighteen inches thick all arQund inside the tube. This
was then carried up with sandstone and portland cement. As sections
of iron were added, the wall was built higher, keeping the top of the
wall only'a few feet from the top of the tube. In this way an enor-
mous loading was obtained, evenly distributed and with a low center
of gravity. It was also impossible to crush the plates.
We were able to sink an average of two and one-half feet a day
with this method, including the placing and riveting of plates and
building of wall. The wall took the place of that much concrete
when it came to filling the tuDe. These foundations have been in use
now for one year and so far have been all that could be asked for.
OUR NEW NAVY AND ITS ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT.
THEODORE VALDEMIROFF, '97.
Our modern battleships and cruisers are the culmination of human
ingenuity for the destruction of life and property. So perfect are
they in their design and construction, that it seems almost as though
we had reached the limit of perfection in their design, unless it be in
the mode of propelling them.
The ordnance equipment of Uncle Sam's new fleet is the most
powerful that the world has ever seen, or, at least, as far as we know
of the implements of war of earlier generations, there is nothing to
compare with it.
When we were gathered in that great arena of the Gulf of Feh-
chili during the Boxers' insurrection in litOO-1901, 1 saw the choicest
vessels of the great fleets of the greatest empires of our times: and


as we compared the pick of those foreign fleets with those of our own,
it seemed to me, and it must have seemed so to every loyal American,
that the American fleet, like the nation it represents, outclassed in
quality anything that Europe or Asia had in those waters. The Ameri-
can battleship in the finest production of American genius and ship-
builders' art.
By virtue of the numerous applications and ingenious contri-
vances, that ponderous, invincible and irresistible mass of steel is
made wonderfully susceptible to the touch of the human hand. She de-
fies every caprice of the elements in order to obey her master's will.
She is the very embodiment of the genius, the power and the will of
the people.
One of the great moral lessons that I have learned during my last
cruise, and which has left a lasting impression upon me, is the sriynifi-
ranee of a determination- in purpose.
An order would come from the Department for such and such a
vessel to proceed at once for such and such a place, a command that
must be obeyed at all costs. The wind may be blowing a gale, the
seas mountain high, it matters not. She must go. A button from the
bridge is pressed, a dial swings in the engine room below, indicating
"half speed ahead." The valves are opened, the throttle given a
turn or so, the passive crank begins to stir, the monster shaft, to
which the propellers are fixed, begins to turn, and in a short while,
steadily and noiselessly, the great vessel has swung out of the harbor
and has faced the stormy sea and the dashing waves. When all dan-
ger is cleared, at the signal of "full speed ahead" she leaps madly
upon the waves with a still greater force and determination. She
may be ascending or descending, pitching or rolling, but still onward
she goes. At times the mighty head seas and the gale combined may
come upon her with such a force, that in spite of all her engines can
do, her progress is imperceptible or she may even be loosing ground
for a time instead of gaining. No matter what obstacles come in her
way, leaving out rocks and shoals, as long as her engines are moving
and the propellers revolving, she will be advancing, though ever so
slowly, till finally one day she conies into a new haven of a new land.
Her great task is now over, the elements are conquered, and the pur-
pose is won through steady application of an even pressure of steam
and by making every pound of it do its utmost to keep that great
shaft turning.
The efficiency of the modern man-of-war has increased wonder-
fully with the advent of electricity. We can no more compare the
modern, electrically equipped man-of-war with those of Nelson's, Paul
Jones', or Decatur's vessels, than we can compare our American cup
defenders with the Filipino dug-outs.
The use of the electric motor has supplanted a vast amount of
manual labor, and has reduced to a minimum the number of heat
radiating and leaky steam pipes throughout the vessel. On our latest


cruisers, there are only three main steam pipes going out from the
boilers, two of them lead to the main engines and one to the dynamo
room. This is a saving not only in decreasing considerably the init-
ial condensation, but in reducing to a minimum the danger to human
life in case of action.
There is very little said in time of action on one of our modern
vessels. It is all action. All commands are given out, all intelligence
transmitted by means of electric buttons, levers, telephones and
speaking tubes. The spectacular and the dramatic has been elimi-
nated and the most efficient and the most practical has taken its
place. The "ash whip," the donkey boiler, the steam winch, and the
hydraulic ram, are all prehistoric war relics for our new battleships
and cruisers. There are no more overhead steam pipes with i-heir
leaky joints and the inevitable hot drops in your collar when you least
expect them. There is no longer any danger of the hydraulic pipes burst-
ing or the pumps getting out of order just when you need them most
to turn the turrets, to train the great guns or to run the shells into
position. There are no more bulky pumps, compressors, traps and
other accessories to rob you of valuable space. A couple of one-inch
iron pipes or a heavy pine moulding issues from the dynamo room,
leads along the bulkhead or along the upper deck, and descends to a
thirty or forty horse power electric motor. There is nothing to burst
by the sudden jars, or to be shaken loose. Everything is done noise-
lessly, neatly, and safely.
Besides the illumination of the ship, electricity is used for elevat-
ing, depressing, and detonating or firing of the great guns. An elec-
tric range finder has been tried and found to be very accurate but it
was not practical, as in case of action, the vessel must be changing
position at the time and still keep up a steady fire. As the electrical
apparatus necessitated the use of a ballistic galvanometer, the shak-
ing of the vessel made it impossible to take an accurate reading, so
it was abandoned. The shell rammers are now operated by elec-
tricity. The turning and ventilation of the turrets, and the ventila-
tion of the entire ship are also done electrically. All steam and
sailing launches, cutters, gigs and whaleboats are hoisted and lowered
by electricity. The night signals, general alarms and bunker alarm
systems are electrically operated. All of the ammunition hoists,
machine shop tools, and air compressors are worked by electric
motors. On our latest addition to the navy, electric laundry and dish
washing machines are to be installed.
Besides the regular lighting, power and search light circuits, there
is another circuit, installed throughout the decks, which is called the
"battle circuit." This circuit is used only in extreme cases, such as
when a vessel or a fleet of vessels is trying to sneak into a harbor, as
Admiral Dewey did at Manila Bay, or when they attempt to close
upon an enemy without being observed. In such cases, all the long
cabled portable battle lanterns are plugged in their receptacles, the


battle circuit is cut in and all other circuits are cut out. The entire
ship is in darkness, except the engine room and the dynamo room
where the battle covers must be screwed to the air ports, so as to
completely bar the light from being' seen from the outside. The port-
able battle lanterns are lodged it a metallic cylinder with a shutter,
so they could conceal the light completely or just show enough to set
a fuse or a shell or attend to some other little detail without attract-
ing attention at a distance. In such cases, a lead colored vessel is like
a phantom on the high seas. It is next to impossible to detect her
until she is almost upon her prey and then it is too late.
The general alarm bells are worked by springs, which are so
arranged that three general alarms can be given on one winding.
The pressing of one button sets off every bell in the ship at the same
time, as the circuit is completed by the pressing of the button and
the electromagnets pull up the ratchets and release the wheels which
keep the bells ringing until they have made one complete turn, and
then the ratchet falls back in the slot.
The bunker lire alarms are small brass cups about one inch by one-
half inch partly filled with mercury and are plugged with an insulat-
ing plug, in the center of which is lodged a thermometer glass tube,
about three-quarters of an inch long. One end of this is submerged
in the mercury, while a small metallic needle plugs the other end.
The mercury cup is connected with one side of the circuit while the
metallic needle is connected to the other. If, by fire, escaping steam
or general overheating, the temperature in the bunkers should rise
to about 200" P., the mercury rises in the tube, completes the circuit
with the metallic point and continues to ring the bells until the evil
has been remedied. As each bunker has from three to five or more or
more of those alarms, and each one is numbered, one could tell at a
glance upon the annunciator, just where the trouble lies.
The search lights vary in size from eighteen inches to thirty
inches in diameter, that is, the diameters of their reflectors. Most of
the search lights are equipped with parabolic silver amalgamated
reflectors. They are used to distinguish things at a distance during
the night and also to send signals at great distances. Under favorable
atmospheric conditions, intelligence can be conveyed at wonderfully
long distances. During the early days of our occupation of the Phil-
ippines, the Charleston sent a message from Batangas Hay to the
Olympia in Manila Bay, a distance of some 50 miles as the crow flies.
In the base of the search light are two small motors, one of which
operates it horizontally and the other vertically, so that in case of
bad weather or extreme danger, the search light can be operated
either from the bridge or from the conning tower by means of con-
trollers.
The night signal or the Ardois system, consists of four lan-
terns of some two feet in length each, one-half of which is a ribbed,
red glass cylinder and the other is a clear glass ribbed lense.


Two sixteen or thirty-two candle power lamps are put in, then those
four lanterns are strung upon a cable from the mast with a minimum
distance of twelve feet between each one of them. The wires are
connected to a keyboard, similar to those of typewriters, and by the
variation of the red and white lights, the whole alphabet is covered
and more to spare.
Nearly all of the generators are of the standard multipolar
t3'pe, direct connected to vertical type or marine engines. For some
reason or another, all of the generators for the navy are designed for
eighty volts. Some of the recent vessels have had 125 volt units
installed in them.
In order to better appreciate the vast amount of current that is
used on a modern warship, I will give very briefly the electrical equip-
ment on some of our new battleships and cruisers:—
Alabama, a battleship, has eight 32 K. W. generators, 46 motors
for turning turrets, ammunition hoists, blowers, air compressors, etc.,
four :i(Mnch search lights, an illuminating set for decorative pur-
poses, 850 incandescent lamps, two night signaling sets, one for each
mast, and a most complete system of internal communication.
The Maine, Missouri and Ohio, will each have four 50 K. W. and
four 32 K. W. generators.
The Virginia, Nebraska, Georgia, Xew.lersey aud Rhode Island will
each have four turrets, two for the 12-inch guns with 8-inch superim-
posed turrets and 8-inch turrets in the waist, to be operated electri-
cally. Each of these vessels will have two 100 K. W. and six 50 K.-W.
generators, 1000 incandescent lights, six 30-inch search lights, two
night signaling sets, one for each mast, and motors for all the above
enumerated purposes.
The Pennsylvania, Colorado, California, South Dakota, West Vir-
ginia, and Maryland will have three 100 K. W., four 500 K. W. gener-
ators. 1250 incandescent lights, six 30-inch search lights and all the
above mentioned accessories.
The total output of the generators in 179 vessels of our new navy,
those already built and those which are being built or are authorized
by an act of Congress, amounts to 15,121 K. W. The total number of
search lights installed is 357, and the total number of night signaling
sets will be 116.
The cost of electrical repairs of the navy amounted to over $425,
000 for the fiscal year ending last June. If we take a very liberal
allowance of say two per cent, for repairs, it gives us an initial cost
of $21,250,000 which, even at that figure, is much below the actual
sum paid by the United States government for the electrical equip-
ment of its great new navy.


EDITORIALS.
This issue of The Technic includes Vol. XIV. and Vol. XV.
Owing to lack of financial assistance the 1901 Technic was not pub-
lished. The articles by Prof. F. C. Wagner and Mr. Alex. E. Kastl
were written for last year'9 volume.
The great demand for the article on " Dynamics of Reciprocating
Engines," by Prof. M. E. Cooley, originally printed in the 1888 issue,
has occasioned its reappearance here. The text has been revised and
all the figures have been redrawn.
Mr. H. C. Ripley the author of ''The River and Harbor Works
and the Civil Engineer," is a graduate C E. of the U. of M.F 1870, and
was in the government service from 1870 to 1890 in professional work
in the improvement of rivers and harbors. Since 1890 he has made
a specialty of river and harbor improvements and marine construc-
tions. He has practiced extensively in Mexico and to some extent in
South America. He was a member of the board of engineers on
the improvement of Aransas Pass, Texas, and of the board of engin-
eers for the protection of Galveston from overflows from Gulf storms.
He was also the recipient of a silver medal and diploma from the Paris
Exposition of 1900 as colaborator in an exhibit made by Prof. L. M.
Haupt for a method of improving harbors on sandy coasts.
Several excellent contributions have been omitted from this issue
for lack of space.
Special acknowledgement must be made of the assistance our
alumni and advertisers have rendered us in publishing this number.

SOME PHASES OF HYDRAULICS.
PHOFESSOR GARDINER S. WILLIAMS, PROFESSOR OF EXPERIMENTAL HYDRAULICS
AT CORNELL UNIVERSITY.
Not infrequently reference is made to the Science of Hydraulics, but
ii one gives the subject close scrutiny he will be quite likely to conclude
that as yet it has hardly reached the dignity of a science and at the present
time should rather be classed as merely an art.
Take up any modern text-book on hydraulics and the treatment of the
questions therein discussed is along essentially the same lines as were
proposed by DuBuat at the beginning of the last century. The phenomena
are explained upon the theory that water flows in straight lines or layers
and that the loss of head in a flowing stream varies as the square of the
velocity from some imagined connection with the laws of freely falling
bodies. The flow over a submerged weir is treated as being made up of
two parts, the submerged portion following one law and the unsubmerged
another.
The first of these assumptions is perhaps natural and in some cases
may not be seriously astray; the second is excusable since experimental
errors are frequently sufficient to mask the true law, especially when only
a few observations are made on any one pipe and a comparatively small
range Of velocity is covered, but the last is the height of absurdity.
Even so eminent an experimenter as the late Hamilton Smith, Jr.,
whose "Hydraulics" is certainly the most satisfactory work on the subject
in our language, spent an immense amount of labor in comparing the results
of weir experiments by different observers and entirely overlooked in his
analysis the influence of different methods of reading head.


The late Mr. James B. Francis, than whom no more careful experi-
menter has ever lived, based certain conclusions on the result of a single
experiment, which by chance was the only one that could have been made
which would not have given him an indication of conditions existing, which,
on his authority have ever since been understood to be absent.
Experiments may appear to prove all sorts of notions, and when the
investigator gives only his conclusions he precludes forever his work from
aiding further in the true solution of his problems. To those experi-
menters who, like Darcy, Bazin, Francis, Fteley, Stearns, Freeman and
Fitzgerald have given us first of all the facts as they observed them,
hydraulics owes much and will owe much more as time passes. To those
who have simply given their conclusions from unpublished experiments,
hydraulics owes next to nothing, and oftentimes a debit should be charged
against them for misleading.
History.—While to Bossut1 and DuBuat' is due the credit of laying the
foundations of our present knowledge of Hydraulics about one hundred
years ago, it is only within the last half century that marked advances have
been made, in taking the subject beyond the doors of laboratory buildings.
Hydraulics may be divided into four parts, viz.:
The measurement of water, the conduction of water, water power, and
water transportation, taking the last in its broad sense to include harbor
works, river improvements and canals. Only the first two can be included
within the limits of this discussion.
In the measurement of water the Americans took the lead with the
experiments at Lowell, Mass., by Mr. James B. Francis on the flow of water
over weirs and the determination of discharge of open channels by means
of floats, from 1841 to 1855, the work being carried out on a scale of magni-
tude that has been exceeded in only one series of recorded experiments
where volumetric measurement was attempted, and with an accuracy and
attention to detail that has served as a model for all experimenters since.*
Mr. Francis may be regarded as the father of weir measurement in America
but he has been duly followed by Messrs. Fteley and Stearns in their work
on the Boston Water Supply from 1876 to 18804, and in their hands the
current meter for accurate work in small channels was brought to a very
high degree of perfection. In measuring volumetrically the flow over a
weir 19 feet long at a head of 1.06 feet, involving a discharge of 130 cubic
feet per second, these investigators made a record that is not likely to be
surpassed. Hamilton Smith, Jr., has also added valuable experimental data
to this branch of the subject. Mr. Hiram F. Mills of Lawrence, Mass., at
one time an assistant of Mr. Francis, and finally, on the death of Mr.
Francis, his successor as Engineer of Canals and Locks at Lowell, made
at the Essex Mills and elsewhere in Lawrence, between 1870 and 1880, a
very extensive investigation upon the measurement of discharge by means
of the Pitot Tube, an instrument first practically applied by Henry Darcy
at Paris about 1850. Since Mr. Mills' investigations5 the Pitot Tube in
various modified forms has been in regular use for measuring the water
consumed for power purposes by the various manufacturing establishments
at Lawrence. It is greatly to be regretted that during a long and busy life

•See Trans. Am. Soc. C. E. Vol. XLVII.


Mr. Mills has never found it possible to prepare for publication any of the
large amount of valuable data and information which he collected, and no
less than four independent investigations have since retravelled portions of
the field so fully covered by him long before.
The first of these subsequent investigators was Col. Henry Flad of St.
Louis, whose experiments were carried on upon the water mains of that
city about 1884 and whose results have never been published except in
connection with the U. S. Patent office * where his conclusions are set forth
in various patents on apparatus devised by him.
The remaining three investigations were carried on quite simultaneously
though entirely independently from 1806 to 1900 by Mr. William M. White
on the Sewerage Works of New Orleans, Mr. Edward S. Cole on the water
system of Terre Haute, and by the writer and his associates on the water
system of Detroit. These later investigations have all been brought
together and discussed in the Transactions Am. Soc C. E- Vol. XLVII.
In 1888 Mr. Clemens Herschel, who had been formerly an assistant to
Mr. Francis at Lowell, presented to the profession' his invention of the
Venturi meter which has proved the most useful means of continuous
measurement of the flow of water in pipes yet devised.
Between 1888 and 1890 the accuracy of the nozzle for measuring water
was demonstrated in experiments at Lawrence, Mass., by Mr. John R. Free-
man," a former assistant of Mr. Mills, and one of the most convenient means
of temporarily determining discharge in moderate quantities was thus
placed at the disposal of engineers.
The subject of water meters for application to small quantities hardly
comes within the scope of this review.
The leading foreign investigators in the line of the measurement of
water have been Poncellet, Lesbros and Boileau in France from 1830 to
1850, and Henry Bazin, 1886 to 1808, the last named having contributed
more to our knowledge of the laws and phenomena of Hydraulics as
included in the first two subdivisions than any person in history. Begin-
ning his work as an assistant to Henry Darcy in his renowned experiments*
upon the flow of water in pipes at the Chaillot Water Works Stations,
Paris, from 1849 to 1851, he was further associated with his chief in plan-
ning the experiments upon open channels, and on the premature death of
M. Darcy was left to complete the investigation which extended from 1855
to 1858, the results being published10 at Paris in 1865, and they constitute
one of the most valuable volumes in hydraulic literature.
After remaining in obscurity, so far as experimental hydraulics were
concerned, for so long a period that an eminent writer referred to him as
"the late M. Bazin," he again entered the field of investigation with a dis-
cussion of the variations of velocity at the same point in a running stream"
and the contraction of the liquid vein," and made, from 1886 to 1898, at

Dijon, France, the most extensive investigations of the flow of water over
weirs yet undertaken," and followed this by an investigation of the distri-
bution of velocities in circular conduits ".
Coming now to the flow of water in pipes the first series of experi-
ments conducted on an extended scale were those of Darcy mentioned
above, which for many years stood as the only reliable work on pipes of
commercial size, and little was added in the way of systematic knowledge,
until Hamilton Smith, Jr.," collected the subsequent data, carefully culling
out much that was imperfect, and adding several valuable series of observa-
tions of his own.
Outside of Darcy and Bazin about the only foreign experimenter whose
work has contributed to our knowledge of this branch of the subject with
pipes of commercial sizes is Dr. Lampe, whose experiments upon the Danzig
pipe line," though in many respects imperfect, have been a valuable addition
to our knowledge. Among American experiments especially deserving of
mention are those of Mr. Frederic P. Stearns," upon the 48" Rosemary
siphon of the Boston water supply when new, and those of Mr. Desmond
Fitzgerald" on the same pipe some twenty years later, in both a tuberculated
condition and after it was cleaned, which together make one of the most
valuable series of experiments on records; the experiments at Rochester"
by Mr. Emil Kuichling; those on the East Jersey Water Co.'s steel mains
under the direction of Mr. Clemens Herschel," and those on steel and wood
stave pipe at Ogden," Utah, by Messrs. Marx, Wing and Hoskins; a series
at Los Angeles on wood stave pipe by Mr. Arthur Adams," and two series
at Seattle by Mr. Theron A. Noble." The work of Mr. Elliott C. Clark on
the Boston main drainage brick tunnel" and by Mr. Geo. H. Benzenberg on
the Milwaukee" brick sewer outlet should also be mentioned, as well as
experiments by Mr. Alphonse Fteley upon the Sudbury aqueduct of
Boston." But by far the most extensive, accurate and complete investiga-
tion by an American, and one that is surpassed if at all only by the work of
Darcy, was that of Mr. John R. Freeman upon the hydraulics of fire
streams" made at Lawrence from 1888 to 1890.
Experiments of importance have also been made at Detroit" by the
writer and his colleagues, Messrs. Clarence W. Hubbell and George H.
Fenkell; and at the Hydraulic Laboratory" of Cornell University by
Messrs. A. V. Saph and E. W. Schoder, and by Messrs. Arthur Adams and
W. E. Wilson.
With the preceding brief outline of our sources of knowledge in these
two branches of the subject it may be proper to consider the present status.

Flow in Pipes.—Considering, first, the flow of water in pipes, it will be
remembered that it is ordinarily taught that the loss of head due to the
flow of water in pipes varies as the square of the velocity, which may be
expressed by the formula H = of. Obviously if the above statement be
correct, then for any given pipe, c in this formula must be a constant. If
it is not a constant, or sufficiently near one so that its deviation can be
charged to experimental errors, then as obviously, H does not vary as if.
Now in view of the fact that in all the experiments on record there are less
than half a dozen in which c is a constant, or anything near one, it seems
a little strange that nearly all the text-books should teach the above law as
the correct one, but such is nevertheless the case. Before the days of
logarithms this might have been permissible on the grounds of conveni-
ence, but as the logarithm was a contemporary of the oldest of our flow
formulas there is little excuse for it today. As the application of log-
arithms to the solution of such problems as are involved in the determina-
tion of the correct law of variation in the above case may not be as familiar
to all as they have become to some during the past few years, the process
will be explained.
If H varies as any power of v we may write H = mV*, which is at once
recognized as a general equation of a plane curve passing through the
origin. If m and n are constants in any given case, as they always appear
to be in equations of flow, we may express the equation in the logarithmic
form thus: log H = log m + n log v, which is seen to be the equation of a
straight line whose intercept on the H or Y axis is log m, and whose slope
is n. Consequently if we plot the logarithms of H and v from our observ-
ations we get a straight line from whose inclination n can be determined,
and m can be gotten by placing log v=.o, i. e., v=.l, whence as might have
been noticed m = H for tr = I.
If instead of the logarithms a paper be used which is ruled to a logar-
ithmic scale, which can be made by using an ordinary slide rule scale for
ruling it up—the io-inch base or square root scale will be found most sat-
isfactory—the observations can be plotted directly and much labor saved.
If such plottings be made of existing experiments it will be found that
in the case of all those on ordinary water pipe sizes, 3" diameter and above,
the exponent falls between 1.70 and 2.10 and that the higher exponents are
found in the cases of rough pipes, and with ordinarily smooth pipes the
exponent will always be in the neighborhood of 1.80 and as an average
value 1.85 may be taken. The value of m in the equation H = mz'n is a
function of the diameter, of the form m = k/dP and the value of p will be
found to be about 1.25.
Putting r the hydraulic radius in place of d we have a new constant
k', and transposing and combining constants the equation H = mif1 =
jf/rfl-251/1-86 = X'/fl.25 2,1.85 may be written in the form so familiar as the
Chezy formula, but with different exponents v = cr0-67j064, a form sim-
ilar to that proposed by Dr. Lampe, v = cr&lt;&gt;-69* jO.555, and to that proposed
by Mr. Allen Hazen and the writer, v = crO.68 $0.54," any of which is a more
rational formula for ordinary straight pipes than is v = crV* j%, as in the
former c will be a constant while in the latter it will be a variable. But
inasmuch as n varies with roughness and possibly other causes, so tn also
varies and much more widely, whence it follows that no general equation
can be made applicable to all pipes without a range of both the exponent of
r and of s, and for application to open channels somewhat different values
may be required from those required for closed pipes, but with a formula
"Eng. Record, March 28, 1903.


of this type, if the variations be taken care of in the coefficient its range
will even then be much less than in the case of the Chezy formula.
Flow over Weirs.—Coming now to our knowledge of the flow of water
over weirs there are at the present time three formulae in common use in
the United States.
The oldest and also the most popular is that of Mr. Francis'.
(2 = 3-33 (L — o.wH) H3/a wherein:
Q = the discharge in cubic feet per second.
L = the length of the weir in feet.
n = the number of end contractions.
H = the depth on the weir in feet measured from the level of the crest
to the level of still water, and therefore = A + /»« where h is the observed
head 6 ft. upstream from the weir and ha is the head to which the velocity
of flow at that point is due. As an exact determination of the value h,
to be applied in a general case has never been established Mr. Francis
presented the following empiric formula for the value of H to be used in
the above equation.
H=[{h + h„) 3/2 — h3/2] 2/3 so that for a weir without end con-
tractions, » = o, the whole formula becomes
Q = 3-33L [(h + h„) 3/2 _ ft 3/2] 2/3;fca being the head to which the
mean velocity of the flowing stream is due at the plane of measurement of
head, and is obtained by a series of approximations from the Q first com-
puted without the correction.
The next formula is that of Fteley and Stearns, which is:
Q = 3.31 LH 3/2_)_ 0.007 L and must be corrected for velocity of
approach by adding to the second member a quantity ranging from 1.3 to
1.5 ha as determined above. This formula is not applicable to weirs with
end contractions.
As these latter investigators experimented upon weirs of different
heights it is possible from their observations to plot a curve giving a more
accurate correction for the velocity, and the results of these investigations
showed that even when the head on the weir was equal to its height above
the bottom of the channel of approach there was no change in the laws
governing the flow from those controlling when the head was only one-
tenth of the height. This was an important advance as Mr. Francis had
confined the application of his formula to cases where the head was not
more than one-third the height of the weir.
The third formula is that of Bazin, and it differs from the others in
providing for the velocity of approach in its coefficient, so that there are no
corrections to make as in the two other cases. The formula like that of
Fteley and Stearns is only applicable to weirs without end contractions.
For English units this formula is:
Q = (0.405 + 0.00084/k) [1 + 0.055 W(p + h))2]Lh V 2gh wherein p
is the height of the weir, the other units being as before.
The question is often raised as to which formula gives the more accur-
ate results, and it has been the writer's privilege to conduct a long series
of experiments on two weirs of heights of 11.24 ft. and 6.65 ft. and of 16
ft. lengths over which the water could be passsed in succession, for the
purpose of throwing light on this question.
The conclusion is that for small heads there is practically no choice.
That the Francis formula becomes inaccurate after passing the limits
set for it by its author, viz.:
Heads between 0.5 ft. and 2.0 ft. and a height of weir not less than 3 h.
That either of the other formulae give accurate results for heads of
from 0.2 ft. to 4.0 ft., and so long as h does not exceed the height of the


weir but that the head must be read at points corresponding to those used
by the experimenters originally, viz., for the Fteley and Stearns formula,
6 ft. upstream and near the level of the crest, and for the Bazin formula
about 2Yx to 3 times the height of the weir upstream from it.
All the weir formula are based on the assumption that the head meas-
ured by the experimenters was the elevation of the surface of the water
above the weir crest, a condition which is only attained at one particular
head by reason of the effect of the velocity of the stream upon the pressure
transmitted through the orifices to gage tube or pail. For small heads this
difference is too small to be measured, but for high heads the surface of
the flowing water will often stand nearly or quite an inch higher than that
in the gage pail, and if the pail be connected to an orifice in the side wall
of the canal in the plane of the weir the surface of the water in the pail
will be at about 0.65 of the actual vertical distance from the crest of the
weir to the surface of the sheet flowing over it.
For this reason the writer prefers to measure the head upon a weir by
means of the scratch of a sharp plumb-bob suspended on a steel tape from
a fixed point above the water to any of the supposedly more delicate
devices, when high heads are to be handled.


ILLUMINATION.
GEO. W. PATTERSON, JR.
Artificial illumination has been used by man from the remotest
antiquity. Light may be looked upon from two different standpoints; first,
that of the scientist (either the mathematical physicist or the psycho-physi-
cist), or second, that of the engineer. Let us briefly consider what man has
done in using the means at his disposal to accomplish the end sought—that
is, the satisfactory illumination of his dwelling and other buildings and
other spaces outside.
Light from the mechanical standpoint, we now know, is propagated to
the eye by means of a transverse motion in the all-space-pervading ether. If
this motion is too fast or too slow, our eyes cannot appreciate it. The most
rapid vibrations (highest frequency) which we can appreciate, we know as
violet light, the slowest as red. The eye appreciates the light better and bet-
ter as we go from the ends of the spectrum toward the middle, and has its
highest appreciation of light in the green. In other words, the same energy
spent in green light, produces greater sensation than the same energy spent
in light of other colors.
As light travels outward from a small source, its energy is spread over
surfaces, whose areas increase with the square of the distance from the
source, hence the intensity of the light at any point decreases with the
inverse square of the distance.
The eye, in addition to its inability to appreciate equally, equal quantities
of energy spent in producing light of different color, has the further lack of
ablity to judge fairly of lights of the same color but of different intensity.
Fechner's psycho-physical law that the sensation is proportional to the
logarithm of the stimulus, states the truth with more or less approximation.
It is an interesting fact that the eye involuntarily protects itself against ad-
mitting too much light, by partially closing the pupil; and when the intensity
of the light falls again, the pupil opens again so as to admit more light.
When in the field of vision, there happen to be intensely bright objects as
well as others less bright, the eye, in protecting itself from the former, must
render the latter only slightly visible. The fault with the illumination of
the latter is then only apparent—not real—and is to be charged to the pres-
ence of the intensely bright objects in the field of vision. The remedy is to
be found in shading the eye from the glare, or by diffusing the light so as to
illuminate objects by sources of larger area and smaller intrinsic brilliancy.
For this purpose we use to surround the source globes of ground or milky
glass or of transparent glass with ribbed surfaces outside and in. The whole
globe then becomes a secondary source of light of large area and low in-
tensity. Although some light is wasted in this way, yet the general effect is
so improved that light seems to be gained. The automatic adjustment of
the pupil caused by change in the intensity of light is not instantaneous, but
requires time. If the light is unsteady, the effect is to tire the eye. For this
reason it is of first importance that lamps should emit a constant quantity of
light.
Theoretically we may define the efficiency of a light as the ratio of
power converted into light producing rays to the whole input of power.


But as different colors affect the eye unequally, this definition may be con-
sidered unsatisfactory. To some it might seem possible to express the
efficiency as the ratio of output of light to the input of power; but it will
be observed that this is a ratio of unlike quantities; whereas true efficiency
is a pure member, which must be the ratio of like quantities. The input
may be measured in watts or horsepower, and the output in candle power
or other like unit. The former is exactly measurable; the latter is not, for
it depends on sense-perception, which for different colors and different
persons produces different results. However, we may say that different
sources of light give vastly different results for the same input of power
and that the less efficient lights waste a greater per cent, of power in heat.
Under many circumstances heat is objectionable as an unavoidable com-
panion of light, and those sources of light are most desirable, other things
being equal, for which the heat is a minimum. Lights which depend on
combustion are objectionable, as they vitiate the air.
To the engineer artificial lighting presents its commercial as well as its
scientific side, and consequently in addition to the above we must discuss
the cheapness of lights. What might in a loose way be called the financial
efficiency of lights, is the ratio of the output in candle power to the input in
dollars and cents. This financial efficiency is the determining factor in the
choice of illuminants for most people. The extreme cheapness of petroleum,
when compared with gas and electric lamps, is sufficient to outweigh other
considerations with many people.
Until within a comparatively short time all artificial lights depended on
red, yellow or white-hot carbon. Among these lights are candles, oil or
kerosene lamps, and lately incandescent and arc lamps. The increase in
efficiency in going through the above series from candle to arc lamp, is de-
pendent on the higher temperature of the lights last named. Nearly the
whole of the energy radiated by the candle is in the invisible parts of the
spectrum beyond the red. As the temperature is raised, the proportion of
the energy used in producing visible waves—what we call light—increases.
The arc lamp, which is the most efficient light producer, falls far below per-
fection; for the energy if best spent would give six times as much light as
furnished by the arc lamp. However, great improvement has been made in
the conversion of invisible power into light, for the arc lamp does this about
no times as well as the candle. Besides the lights depending on the incan-
descence of carbon, there are two quite modern lights which depend on the
incandescence of other material than carbon. These are the Welsbach lamp
which produces light by means of a white hot mantle of thorium oxide with
an admixture of cerium oxide. The other is the Nernst lamp which has re-
cently come on the market in commercial form. This lamp consists of a
glower of porcelain of special composition which when cold is a non-con-
ductor, but when hot a good conductor. As the conductivity of the glower
increases very rapidly with increase of temperature, it becomes necessary to
protect the glower. This is accomplished by means of an iron wire mounted
in a vacuum tube. As the current increases, the resistance of the iron wire
also increases, thus protecting the glower from excessive currents. To
start the current through the glower, it is necessary to raise its temperature
up to the point where there is enough heat generated in the glower to cause
its temperature to rise further without outside aid. This first heating is
caused by electric heaters just above the glower, which are cut out of circuit
when the current in the glower rises above a predetermined value.
The Nernst lamp is far more brilliant, intrinsically, than any other light
except the electric arc; and it is necessary to diffuse its light by means of a
ground glass globe. Its color is a very agreeable light yellow, nearly white.

FACTORY AND WAREHOUSE ARCHITECTURE.
A. K. ADLER, '94.
Part I.
General Planning.
The first essential to the proper conception of factory needs is a deep
and thorough understanding of manufacturing processes. A factory de-
signer must have a working knowledge, not only of machinery in general,
but also of that larger machine, the factory in its entirety which takes in
raw material and delivers the finished product in a manner similar to each
machine on its floors. Each step in the process is a component part of the
mechanism which the architect is called upon to design. It is axiomatic that
the first requirement in the design of a prospective manufacturing plant is
an intimate knowledge on the part of the designer of the entire process
which he called upon to house and articulate. He must know the purpose
and method of operation of each machine, the floor space required to operate
it and the weight of the machine proper and the material around it. The
various steps in the process calling for bench and hand work are equally
important. After having mastered each step and the relation of each step to
all the others, the architect is prepared to commence on the preliminary lay
outs.
The first step is to determine the floor space required in each depart-
ment, the principal factors being, first, The floor space required for the
most efficient operation of each machine; second, Aisles and runways;
third, Space required for the temporary piling or racking of stock as it
accumulates during accidental stoppage of parts of the machinery, and
fourth, A percentage allowed for expansion, which varies according to the
nature of the business. I have had one instance in my practice of a tripling
of the proposed output before the work was well under way, but it is usually
unnecessary to provide for more than 25 per cent, increase in output without
additional building.
The next step is to determine upon the type of building required to
meet the above conditions combined with questions of power transmission,
lighting, handling of material and loading of floors. In laying out the path
of the material through the shop it is essential that the work progress with-
out doubling back on itself; going backward always makes confusion and
in many branches of work it is very likely to result in great damage to the
unfinished product, especially when part of the process is wet work. As a
general rule, when the manufactured article or the machinery employed is
heavy, unwieldy or bulky, a one story building is indicated, as it will be
found that the cost of handling is enormously increased in such plants when
it is necesary to elevate and lower the product during manufacture. The
cost of elevating in such case is small, but the factor of labor in handling,
delay in waiting for elevators, space required for storage, separation of de-
partments and the tendency to cross paths are factors in the shop cost, leav-
ing considerations of power transmission and lighting out of account. In
wet work such as tanning and paper making, one story buildings always give
the most satisfaction.
When the product and machinery are both light it is often economical
to work in high buildings, especially if good elevator accommodations are
provided. In such factories it is generally best to work the raw material
upward from floor to floor, using the top floor as a stock room with an


express elevator or dumb waiter, or better still, a continuously operating
link belt conveyor to the shipping department
Having determined the general layout of the building or buildings the
next step is the machinery layout. It is absolutely essential that the final
location of every machine be determined at this point. The principal factors
to be considered are the leaving of sufficient room and no more for the most
economical working of each machine; the arrangement of all machines of
the same kind in a compact group, leaving sufficient room alongside each
group for storage of material before and after working through the group.
If this precaution be not taken, a condition of chaos begins whenever pro-
duct is not disposed of ahead as fast as the departments behind produce it.
It is also well to provide for a 25 per cent, increase in power, shafting,
machine floor space, etc Each group of machines should have an independ-
ent power supply running as close to the main source of power as possible.
In almost every case electric transmission will be found the most economical
and practical.
As far as possible each step of a manufacturing process should be
housed in a separate room with brick walls if possible. Where the space re-
quired for a step is small, a number of groups may be united into one de-
partment but all work done in a room should be in the hands of one fore-
man who should have no other duty than that of being responsible for what
goes on within the four walls of his department.
Rooms should be so laid out that work enters and leaves by separate
doors and the material as it works through the room must travel ahead in
such a way that there is no trucking in opposite directions over the same
path.
Receiving and shipping rooms and rooms for sorting and storage of
raw and finished stock are worthy of more careful study than is usually
given to them. Plenty of room and light are absolutely essential for the de-
tection of defects of material and workmanship. Ease of handling to and
from cars or trucks are essential and much time and money may be saved
by labor saving machinery properly designed for the work. The storage of
material must be studied closely and proper racks, etc., provided so that the
floor space may be occupied to the best advantage and the storage system-
atized for easy distribution and collection. When the factory product is
heavy or bulky, it is essential that a separate building be provided for ware-
housing. In a woodworking plant recently designed by the writer, the
factory proper occupies 300,000 feet of floor space and the storage and ship-
ping departments occupy 140,000 square feet, or almost 50 per cent. This,
however, is extraordinary as the output of the plant consists of special
orders made up of stock sections of different sizes which necessitate the
carrying of a huge stock to facilitate prompt shipments, no matter what
the order is. Where the product of a factory is sold before manufacturing
begins, only enough storage need be provided to take care of each order
until it is complete and ready for shipment. Shop costs are greatly reduced
if shipping and receiving can be carried on directly to the railroad. It en-
ables the manufacturer to more easily buy and sell in car load lots and
makes prompt shipments easier. A side track very often turns the tide
from a losing business to a very profitable one.
It is only after the foregoing factors have been reduced to their
simplest terms that it becomes possible to proceed with the working draw-
ings of a factory building. The site of a factory should be governed by
ability to get an abundance of labor as to neighborhood, but its exact loca-
tion should be governed entirely by the foregoing considerations. Consider-
ing shop cost, which makes interest on cost of ground insignificant, all the
above requirements must be met in order to manufacture at such prices as


to undersell competitors. Questions of power production and transmission,
elevator service, light and heating are equally important and will be dis-
cussed hereafter.
The ground having been selected, it then remains to so group the dif-
ferent departments laid out provisionally, either as one story adjacent rooms
or occupying the floors of a high building, as to make a compact unit with-
out waste space and with proper light for each part of the whole. A casual
inspection of existing plants will show that one square foot of well lighted,
well arranged floor space is worth two feet of cut up, dark space. Light on
all sides is the first requirement in good practice. A long, narrow or an L
shaped building with elevators at the center is the best shape in most cases,
excepting for one story buildings, where the different units may be packed
together to occupy the least space and make the line of travel of product
as short as possible.
Many manufacturers using high buildings, find it convenient to have a
warehouse and stock building adjacent to the factory proper and connected
with the main building by bridges at each floor. This is especially useful
when the output of a factory is varied and it also reduces insurance on stock
to a minimum.
Part II.
Construction.
It is taken for granted that the typical factory building is of slow burn-
ing construction. The difficulty of attaching machinery and shafting to fire-
proof work and of making alterations in the structure, also the tendency to
vibration make fireproof factories unpopular even when first cost is not a
consideration. The question of insurance has been solved by the Factory
Mutuals in which the cost of insurance is lower for properly built wood
construction than is the rate for fireproof construction in the regular com-
panies.
It has been my experience that foundations for this class of work are
figured too light. During a long period of observation, I have seen much
cracking and unequal settlement in factory and warehouse buildings, but I
have never had the slightest trouble in my work when I have followed the
following method: I allow 120 pounds per cubic foot for brickwork, 150
pounds for stone and concrete and 30 pounds for dead load per square foot
of floor area. I then figure the actual live loading on all parts of the struc-
ture, which is usually a simple matter when the building has been laid out
in accordance with the principles set forth in Part I. I then figure the
foundation to carry from 3,000 to 4,500 pounds per square foot, depending
upon the soil. If the usual custom of supposing that all the floors will not
be fully loaded over any one part of the foundation is followed! there is al-
ways bound to be trouble, as I have never yet seen a building which was not
overloaded from basement to roof in some particular part. It may often be
expedient to "skin" columns, piers, etc., but in such cases it is doubly neces-
sary to provide absolutely stable foundations as unequal settlement would
further increase the strains toward which our limit of safety has already
been crowded.
The walls of modern factories must contain a large percentage of win-
dow openings which impose the necessity of pier and curtain wall construc-
tion. In my practice I have found that owners prefer to have the pier
jambs on the inside, as the recesses form convenient pockets for radiators or
machines. The piers should be built with hard burned sewer brick laid in
Portland cement mortar, thoroughly grouted, and may be figured to carry
14 tons per square foot, if reasonable allowance is made for live load. Where
framing is built into the piers, they should be liberally corbelled so that the
timber does not set more than four inches into the brickwork. A double


hooked anchor plate is preferable to the anchor box formerly much used.
In figuring the area of a pier, it is important to deduct for window boxes
and any other wooden parts built into the walls.
Window and door openings in brick walls should be crowned with steel
or cast iron lintels. Many factory experts prefer the steel lintel built up of
an I-beam, channel and angle, or of two angles and two channels. The
writer has used both forms but for openings of eight feet or less, his prefer-
ence is unqualifiedly for cast iron lintels, as by their use the window head
can be set about eight inches higher, making a great increase in volume of
light admitted, and they also lend themselves more readily to the reception
and anchorage of joists, thus making a much stiffer building. Wherever
possible, windows should be of wire glass set in metal frames with an auto-
matic closing device in case of fire. A good metal frame lasts as long as a
wood frame and wire glass costs less for repairs than the ordinary s. t. win-
dow glass, owing to the fact that even when cracked it does not require re-
newal. The corrugations of the glass give an illumination almost as good
as the light given by patented prisms and also cuts off direct sunlight which
is so annoying along south and west fronts.
Doors should be built of three thicknesses of matched dry stuff and
tinned with lock seam tearne plates. They should be hung on very heavy
sheaves or hinges and should invariably be equipped with an electric or
fusible link automatic closing device. In fire walls there should always be
double doors.
Framing lumber should be I sound common, or better, long leaf yellow
pine, square edged and sound. At present prices this will be found more
economical than equivalent sections of white pine, excepting for points adja-
cent to the pineries.
In laying out framing, care should be taken to avoid waste of timber,
which is sold in even lengths; therefore joists should wherever possible be
set at four ft. centers and should be either 14, 16, 18, or 20 ft. long, the
most economical being 16 ft., everything considered, but it is best when
the loads are not excessive to use 20 ft. spans to reduce the number of
posts. Similar rules apply to girders, except that it is usually inadvisable to
increase the span beyond 16 ft Careful calculation will show that for
ordinary loads a sixteen foot square panel requires the least framing per
unit of area.
In figuring the strength of framing, I have followed the practice of the
late Dankmar Adler, who after exhaustive independent research, became
convinced that the usual stresses allowed by engineers in this work could
be increased without injury to the building. No better proof of this can be
offered than that given by the construction of a warehouse near Chicago, in
which floors, that according to the Chicago Building Ordinance should not
be loaded more than 250 pounds per sq. ft., have been carrying without in-
jury for years material weighing over 50 pounds per cubic ft., piled over
entire floors to a height of nine feet. In ordinary cases the simplest formula
for beams uniformly loaded is (abcP -r- Span in feet) in which a is 120 for
white pine and 160 for yellow pine and 180 for heart stock yellow pine,
b and d are expressed in inches. The extreme fiber stress in this is 1,440
pounds per inch for yellow pine.
Floors of factories should be constructed of 2$4 inch net x6 inch yellow
pine matched and dressed both sides, two courses of building paper and a
wearing floor of %" x 2J4" factory maple matched, end matched, blind
nailed and laid diagonally.
A 1 inch by 4 inch base should be nailed to walls all around and a 1 inch
quarter round, nailed to floor snug up to base. After the joists and girders


have shrunk, the quarter round may be removed and a I inch by 2 inch strip
substituted.
Automatic Sprinklers, installed according to the rules of the Insurance
Companies are an absolutely necesary part of a good factory. If properly
installed and maintained they are an absolute safeguard against fire, and in
addition they are a highly paying investment owing to the reduction in
insurance which they effect. In plants having a total sprinkled area of more
than 150,000 sq. ft. it is well to have a cistern in connection with the fire
pump, having a capacity of one hour's water supply for the pump. This, in
connection with a proper outfit of fire hose, insures a sufficient supply of
water to form what might be called a secondary system of fire protection.
Even with the best water works systems an occasional failure of water
supply occurs, and at such times this cistern supply is all that stands
between a slight water damage and a total fire loss.
Joists hung in stirrups have been tried and found wanting and the ten-
dency now is to abandon them entirely except in framing stair wells, etc
When stirrups are used they should be made to carry the top of joist at
least 1 1-2 inches above the top of the girder to allow for shrinkage.
Stairways should always be enclosed in incombustible partitions, pre-
ferably of solid plaster on expanded metal lath and steel furring with self
closing tin clad doors.
Part III.
Power Equipment.
In a properly equipped factory the cost of power production is small
when compared with the pay roll, interest and depreciation on plant and
buildings and the cost of raw material. Therefore the prime factor in this
department is an installation which is least likely to cause interruption in
operation or cramping of producton due to lack of reserve units or
elasticity.
The tendency toward few and large units in the boiler plant is a bad
one, unless it is possible to keep one boiler absolutely in reserve. Boilers and
their settings are far from reliable and where they are run continuously ex-
cept for a hurried shut down at long intervals there is always the danger of
a stoppage of the entire plant at a time when a shut down means great loss.
No plant can be considered good or safe that has not at all times one boiler
out of service. Where manufacturers have used both water tube and ordin-
ary boilers, the general result has been to favor water tube boilers, except in
cases where poor draft or poor firemen have destroyed their efficiency.
Water tube boilers only give satisfaction when they are painstakingly cared
for and where the draft is sufficient to carry a hot fire when there is a
sudden demand for steam.
Engineers are almost universally agreed that the simple Corliss engine
is the only prime mover that can be absolutely relied upon for constant fac-
tory work. Compounding usually decreases the coal consumption but in-
creases the danger of shut down. The uses for exhaust steam in factory
work are so many that condensing is usually out of the question.
Power transmission is a subject on which there is much difference of
opinion. The ease and efficiency with which electric energy is transmitted,
its adaptability to changing conditions and the avoidance of long shafts and
trouble breeding drives make electric transmission very popular with pro-
gressive mechanical engineers. On the other hand the conservative designer
calls attention to the supposed increased danger of shut down, due to the
burning out of the electrical units. On average work none will deny that
electric transmission is more efficient and flexible than the counter, jack,
main and line shafts and the main and secondary belts and drives of


mechanical transmission so that the only real test is that of time. In this
connection we have simply to compare typical plants of the two classes.
The writer has installed over a hundred large generators and motors in fac-
tories, has watched his work carefully and the only accident that has come
under his observation has been the blowing out of a 400 ampere fuse which
was repaired in five minutes. On the other hand he has had several vexa-
tious shut downs in mechanically driven plants which of course stopped the
whole plant, whereas a similar accident in an electric plant would only have
crippled a small part of the factory.
Granting that electric transmission gives the best satisfaction it then
devolves upon the designer to decide upon the size and number of motors.
It is considered good practice to use individual motors upon large machines
consuming 10 or more H.P., especially if these machines are not used con-
stantly. The only drawback to this arrangement is the overload on the motor
in starting. On the whole, if the machines can be arranged in compact groups
fewer and larger motors will be found much more economical both in first
cost and in operation. As an example of this economy the writer recently
installed a hundred H. P. motor to run 36 hand fed machines consuming
four horse power each while being fed and two H. P. each running light
Tests show that the load on the motor is almost exactly ninety horse power.
The calculation was based on the fact that each machine was doing work
only about 40 per cent, of the time. With individual motors each machine
would have required a complete 5 H. P. motor outfit, including a backgear,
doubling the cost and giving 30 motors instead of one to care for. Every
motor of 25 H. P. or over should have its own circuit leading either to a
center of distribution or to the main switch board. Every motor and gen-
erator should have a good circuit breaker. Every electric plant should have
a small power unit large enough to run a single department, including
lights and elevators for night and Sunday emergencies.
The kind of current required in any particular installation depends en-
tirely on conditions. In Chicago the use of 220 volt direct current is almost
universal, even when conditions favor other forms. The argument being
that it is safe, tolerably efficient and that 220 volt machinery and supplies are
easiest to obtain. It lends itself readily to lighting and is also interchange-
able with the local Edison Central Station current.
The heating and ventilation of factories is an important item in reduc-
ing shop cost. The amount and quality of output is noticeably diminished in
winter when these conditions are bad. Wherever possible, blast systems,
using outside air in preference to returned air, should be used. They are
more expensive to run but prove paying investments. One shut-down due
to failure of the ordinary heating methods may cost more than the yearly
expense of running a small engine or motor. The ability to provide ven-
tilation during very warm weather is a secondary advantage.
If a coil system is demanded, it should be of the low pressure, vacuum
type.
Conclusion.
It is of course impossible within the limits of a short article to more
than touch upon the different problems confronting the factory designer.
What has been said may be summed up in the one admonition which must
always be kept in mind: Decide every question in its relation to shop cost.
If an improvement or change of layout will save more than the interest on
its cost it must be made, otherwise the money must not be spent. In general,
first cost of building and machinery must be a minimum and its worth and
efficiency a maximum. It is this method which distinguishes progressive
factory buidling from the short sighted policy that marked the work of a
few years ago.'


ANCHOR ICE.
C. W. HUBBEIX, 93.
It is the purpose of this paper to describe in detail anchor ice difficul-
ties and attempted remedies at the Detroit Waterworks.
Trouble began when the first intake pipe was laid in 1840. At that
time, however, the strainer was near the end of the pier and ice was removed
from it with long poles.
In 1858, a thirty-inch boiler-iron intake was extended into the river
about one hundred fifty feet beyond the end of the pier. The strainer was
a boiler-plate cylinder nine feet in diameter and ten feet high, with a dome
top, perforated with half-inch holes one hundred forty-four to the square
foot. This strainer was set on the bottom of the river in a current running
three miles per hour, in water thirty-four feet deep, the depth of water over
the top of the strainer being twenty-five feet. The flow through the
strainer, at normal capacity, was 3,780 U. S. gallons per minute.
In the early years, Detroit had a reservoir of sufficient capacity to
supply the city during any short period of stoppage. In 1865, it is stated
that for one entire week the engines were able to obtain a supply through
the strainer only during the middle of the day; the reservoir was sufficient
to carry the excess of consumption. A strainer constructed of wood was
recommended at this time; it was believed that ice would not adhere to
wood as it did to iron.
In 1866, a self-acting swing door, 19 in. x 16 in., was put on the down-
stream side of the strainer. This, however, did not afford material
relief; and it was recommended that a larger door be added. The wooden
strainer and larger door were not immediately built.
The Board appointed a special committee to investigate the entire
subject. The door set in 1866 gave but little relief, and was permanently
closed. The following fall, a line of booms enclosing a considerable area
over the strainer was kept in position until the ice formed inside it but
failed to give relief unless the entire river was covered with ice.
The committee continued its investigations; and, in the summer of '68,
divers were employed to build a submerged platform of planks immediately
over the strainer, resting on some thirty piles. It was hoped that such a
platform would prevent the radiation of heat from the strainer, which
would remain at a temperature sufficiently high to prevent ice from adhering
to its surface. The platform, however, proved worse than nothing, as stop-
pages occurred at a higher temperature than before. On December 9th, the
strainer was completely plugged up, with a temperature of only 260. A
diver was sent down and found the strainer and surrounding piles covered
with a mass of ice crystals ten feet high and fifteen feet in diameter. The
entire body of water was filled with crystals of ice, from the surface to the
bottom of the river; these were rapidly adding to the volume of the mass
already collected, as the current brought them swiftly down. Samples of
the crystals were brought to the surface, and for the most part consisted of
sheets and particles thin as paper, with sharp jagged edges. The mass of
ice was thickest on the upstream side of the strainer, a small portion of the
downstream side being nearly free from ice. It was thought that if the
strainer could be enclosed on the upstream side, leaving the downstream


side only exposed, the difficulty would be done away with. A large piece of
canvas was fastened around the piles and to the covering platform, com-
pletely enclosing the strainer except on the downstream side. This was but
just completed when the weather again turned cold, the temperature drop-
ping slightly below the freezing point. Before daylight, the engine was
compelled to stop, there being absolutely no water coming through the
strainer. The wooden platform and canvas were then entirely removed;
and no further difficulty was experienced until December 24th when the
surface ice in the river was in motion, the thermometer standing at 160.
No water could be obtained from 1 o'clock until daylight. Trouble usually
occurred when the river was free from surface ice and the temperature from
8° to 20°. No trouble occurred when the river was covered with ice, no
matter how severe the cold. The greatest number of detentions were at
night or when the sun was obscured by clouds. With an unclouded sun,
no difficulty was ever experienced; and difficulty soon ceased when the tem-
perature exceeded 20° above zero.
The final recommendation of the committee was the entire removal of
all piles and other obstructions adjacent to the strainer. It was believed
that "with nothing but the smooth dome of the strainer for ice particles to
lodge upon, the quantity which would accumulate could not very seriously
prevent the flow of water to the inlet pipe." One year after the recom-
mendations of this committee were presumably carried out, the following
entry was made: "The engine was stopped by ice sixteen times during
December, and frequently had to run at slow speed for want of supply."
The increasing demand for water and the inadequacy of the reservoir
to carry the city over periods of ice trouble caused the Board much anxiety.
In 1869, it was decided to make a second trial of a self-acting door. In
design it was similar to the one tried in 1866, except that it was of larger
size, being 36x48 inches. This door was placed on the top of the strainer
box and afforded limited relief. On December 21st of that year trouble
occurred; however, it was not necessary to completely stop the pump,
and the door furnished a supply equivalent to 2,850 U. S. gallons per
minute.
In 1871, the intake pipe was extended one hundred sixty feet farther
into the river. The holes in the old strainer were increased from one-
half inch to three-quarters inch in diameter, and two additional
strainers were put on the outer end of the pipe. The two new strainers
were about nine feet in diameter, twenty feet long, and were laid horiontally
upon the bottom of the river, extending up and down stream. The top half
only was perforated with holes three-quarters inch in diameter. The object
of supplementing the old strainers with two new ones was "to remedy the
accumulation of ice on the strainer in winter"; followed by the rather
pathetic statement, "I am sorry to say that this has not been wholly accom-
plished."
During the summer of 1873, a second intake pipe was laid at the old
works at the foot of Orleans street. This pipe was three feet in diameter
and was provided with four strainers. The water was taken in through
wooden gratings made of slats, one-half inch opening, all on the down-
stream side so that the direction of the flow of water must be reversed in
order to enter the strainer. It was hoped that this arrangement would
allow much of the sediment and ice held in suspension to pass by. The outer
strainer was provided with a door on the top which could be opened from
the shore by a rod passing inside the pipe, thus permitting the free entrance
of water in case the grating became blocked by ice. At the time the annual
report was made, the weather was favorable for anchor ice upon one occa-


sion only; no trouble, however, occurred. From this time until these pipes
were abandoned in 1877, the official reports of the Board make no further
mention of anchor ice difficulties.' It is therefore fair to presume that the
increased capacity furnished some measure of relief, although probably not
entire immunity.
The new works were located at the present site four miles above the
center of the city. The first intake laid was of boiler-plate, sixty inches in
diameter, one thousand feet long. The strainer was built of timber, fifty-
seven feet long, seven feet eight inches wide, and six feet high. This box
was placed at right angles with the current in water about twenty-seven feet
deep. The strainer bars were set on the downstream side and were of
white oak, three inches wide, three-quarters inch thick on the front edge,
tapering to one-half inch on the back edge. The bars were placed to give
a clear opening of one-half inch on the front edge. This intake delivered
water into the present settling basin which is three hundred sixty-five feet
wide by seven hundred seventy-five feet long, with a depth of thirteen to
seventeen feet.
The new works were put in service December 15, 1877. In the after-
noon of December 7, 1882, the wind changed to northwest and blew a gale.
At six p. m. the thermometer stood at 9° above zero. At 10:30 p. m. the
water in the settling basin was lowered seven feet on account of the accumu-
lation of anchor ice around the strainer in the river. The following morning
at one o'clock the thermometer stood 5° above zero. At 8 a. m .the water
began to rise, and at noon was at the usual height. In the meantime, the
wind had gone down and ice had formed over the strainer in the river. A
second inlet pipe was recommended at this time.
On December 17 and 19, 1883, the same trouble recurred, the water in
the setting basin being lowered about fourteen million gallons.
During the following season, the second intake pipe was completed,
seventy-two inches in diameter, similar in construction to the firstj and
when trouble from ice occurred on December 18, 1884, the new pipe was so
far completed that it could be opened. This relieved the difficulty, and
no further trouble occurred during that season.
The strainer at the end of the seventy-two inch pipe is provided with
a self-acting relief valve. There are two strainer boxes, each five feet by
six feet, thirty feet long, set fifty-five feet apart. These boxes are set at
right angles to the current, water being taken on the downstream side
through vertical white oak slats, as above. Each section is connected to
the valve chamber by pipes four feet six inches in diameter.
November 7, 1886, the reservoir, which had been in service since 1857,
was discontinued. The surface of water in the reservoir was about seventy-
seven feet above the surface of the river, and the discontinuance was neces-
sary on account of the growth of the city which extended rapidly northward
to ground higher than the reservoir itself. The cutting out of this reservoir,
which held ten million U. S. gallons, removed one safeguard against water
famine by anchor ice. as it was sufficient to carry the city for a short time,
even with the pumps shut down.
Late in the fall of 1886, a new set of plate-iron strainers with a cast-iron
relief valve box was made to replace the old wooden strainer box at the
outer end of the five-foot inlet pipe.
In 1888, Belle Isle bridge was constructed; and the engineer reports
that the bridge abutments stopped the surface ice and caused a cover of ice
to form over the strainer much sooner than before, which lessened the
danger of anchor ice.


During the season of 1888, a short brick conduit was laid from the
settling basin to the bank of the river. This was not provided with a
strainer, and remained closed except in case of complete stoppage of the
outer end of the two regular intake pipes. The emergency conduit was used
only once the first winter after it was built; then several years followed
during which it was not used at all, there being no trouble from ice.
In 1889, every other slat was removed from one of the strainers, which
increased the size of opening between the slats from one-half inch to one
and three-quarters inches. In 1890, a third inlet pipe, six feet in diameter
and fifteen hundred feet long, was laid. The strainer was similar to the
others in construction, but the strainer box was laid horizontally with the
current instead of across it, and the opening between slats was made one
and three-quarters inches. About this time, the strainer box on the five-foot
intake first laid was rebuilt, and also placed up and down stream instead
of across the current.
For a period of ten years there was entire freedom from ice trouble,
and those in charge believed that the increased area of the strainers,
together with the new position in which they were placed and the effect of
the bridge abutments in causing surface ice to form earlier in the season,
had effected a permanent cure. Asa matter of fact, however, these things
had little to do with the cessation of trouble, the true cause of which
appeared later in the following manner:
In 1897 and 1898, a sanitary survey was conducted by the engineering
department to ascertain the point at which the purest water available could
be obtained. In this survey an eleftric thermophone was used to determine
temperatures. It was found that the temperature of the water in the river
at a point opposite the waterworks, two miles below Lake St. Clair, was
practically uniform from top to bottom. The current is about two and a
half miles per hour, and the depth of water thirty feet. The variation
between top and bottom was seldom as great as 0.5° P., and was usually not
more than 0.1° or 0.20 F. At certain times, however, a marked difference
was noticeable in the temperature of water near shore and at mid-channel,
probably due to the effect of sun in the shallow water and to the entrance of
shore water. On three different days, when the temperature of the shore
water was colder than at mid-channel, the following results were obtained:
Temperature of water at intake crib 38.80 F.
Temperature of water near shore 36.80 F.
Temperature of water entering settling basin 36.90 F.
On three other days, when the shore water was warmer than that in
the channel, the following results were obtained:
Temperature of water at the intake crib 41.4° F.
Temperature of water near shore 43-3° F.
Temperature of water entering settling basin 430 F.
It will be noted that the temperature entering the settling basin corre-
sponded very closely to the temperature of shore water. It was at first
assumed that water entering at the outer end was changed in temperature
to correspond to the shore water through which the intake pipe passed.
The possibility of breaks near shore was considered unlikely, and no exami-
nation of the pipes was made until the fall of 1899 and spring of 1900.
Divers then found that the joints in the five-foot pipe were leaking badly,
and the two six-foot pipes were broken off entirely at a point near shore.


In one case there was a space of four and one-half feet between two consec-
utive lengths of pipe; and in the other, two sections, each twenty-five feet
long, had been carried away entirely and were found some twenty or thirty
feet down stream from the line of pipe. The indications were that at least
one of the pipes had been broken by dredges which were known to have
anchored in that vicinity shortly after the pipe was laid in 1890; marks of
the dredge dipper were quite distinct. The protection afforded by a break-
water a short distance above and booms enclosing ice areas, caused surface
ice to form early in the season over the open ends of the broken intakes
and for a considerable distance above them. The freedom from anchor ice
which had been experienced for some years past was fully explained; but
as the supply at this point was known to be more or less dangerous on
account of pollution, repairs were made at once. At the point at which the
break occurred, the water was comparatively shallow with little current.
In the meantime the emergency conduit, laid in 1888, had been discon-
tinued because it seemed unnecessary. Repairs to the intake pipes were
completed in the summer of 1900; and during the following winter the cribs
were stopped with ice several times, but thanks to the settling basin which
held a reserve of nearly seventeen million gallons, it was not necessary to
stop the pumps.
The following summer an emergency valve was placed on one of
the six-foot pipes near shore, and a platform extended to it in such
a way that it could be operated in case of difficulty at the cribs. It was
thought that this would prove effective, from the fact that the open end of
pipe had so long been so. Unfortunately, however, the location selected
for the emergency valve was immediately above the waterworks dock
and ice crystals coming down the river accumulated on the up-stream side
of the dock and around the valve, making it necessary to operate the
valve on an average every twenty minutes in order to keep it free.
In the winter of 1901-1902, the trouble from anchor ice at the cribs
was more severe than in the preceding season, although by constant effort a
considerable supply was obtained through the emergency valve. Twice it
was necessary to put the city on short supply, and we were saved frequently
only by the reserve supply in the settling basin. The old emergency conduit
was reopened, and since that time has been used on several occasions.
Again, on December 12th, 1902, the supply was cut off for a few
hours. The trouble at this time, however, was not at the river but in the
strainer wells which connect the settling basin to the pumps. These wells
are fitted with boiler-plate strainers three-eights inch thick, with seven-
sixteenths inch holes, three-fourths inch centers. The strainers are built
into the solid masonry to prevent fish, lizards and other foreign substances
from damaging the pumps and entering the city mains. The trouble was
first noticed about 4:30 a. m. The temperature was about 170 above zero.
No surface ice had yet beervformed on the river or settling basin. A slight
breeze was blowing which ruffled the surface of the settling basin, and the
crystals of ice which seemed to permeate the entire mass of water were
drawn into the basin outlets and lodged against the screens, completely plug-
ging them. No trouble had ever before occurred at this point, and was not
anticipated. The screens were cut with chisels, and water, ice and all, let
onto the pumps about nine o'clock a. m. This procedure, although involv-
ing some risk to the pumps, resulted in no damage. The screens are now
provided with sliding sections which can be removed, leaving only a coarse
bar screen which can be readily raked by hand. Before another winter
approaches, platforms will be built in front of the basin outlets, which it
is believed will be sufficient protection until the basin freezes over.


On account of the expensive repairs and the general unsatisfactory
condition of the boiler-plate intake pipes, the Board of Water Commis-
sioners is now constructing a tunnel ten feet in diameter which will extend
under the river at a depth of about seventy feet to a point near the head
of Belle Isle where the water is thirty feet deep. The intake crib will be
of concrete construction, coming to the surface. It will have a cut-stone
superstructure. The water will enter the intake through twenty-four cast-
iron ports forty-eight inches in diameter. The ultimate maximum capacity
of the tunnel will be at the rate of one hundred and fifty million gallons per
twenty-four hours; and the maximum demand, at the season during which
anchor ice is likely to form, will be about one hundred million gallons
per twenty-four hours. This will give a velocity of a trifle less than nine
inches through the ports. With the consumption as at present, the velocity
through the ports during periods of anchor ice would not exceed five inches
per second. Each port will be provided with a screen of slats leaving
spaces about four inches wide. These screens can be removed by employing
a diver. To provide further protection, a one hundred twenty-five horse-
power steam boiler will be set up on the crib, and two of the ports on the
downstream side will be surrounded by steam pipes, and a circular steam-
pipe at the entrance to the port will be perforated in such a way that a
steam jet will loosen any ice which may adhere. These two ports will
have no screens and will remain closed except in case of trouble. An open
trench will also be provided on the down-stream end of the crib; if neces-
sary, this trench can be kept open by means of men with rakes. The
trench will ordinarily be closed off by a bulkhead, and will be provided
with bar screens to prevent cakes of surface ice from entering. The trench
and downstream ports, including the two fitted with steam-pipes, will be
partially protected in winter by a boom which will enclose several hundred
square feet and will tend to cause the early formation of an ice covering.
A water jet from a fire pump will also be available if required.
The following general conclusions are based in part upon available pub-
lished data, and in part upon personal experience and inquiry.
Danger from ice is ever present throughout northern cities. The
trouble is of three kinds—first, surface ice; second, frazil or needle ice;
third, anchor ice.
Trouble from surface ice is principally confined to large lakes. When
driven by a gale, it piles up on shore to a considerable depth, sometimes
completely surrounding an intake and shutting off the supply. This has
occurred at the old Cleveland crib, and is quite common at the Buffalo
intake. In such cases, dynamite is sometimes used to clear away the ice.
There is danger also to intake pipes which are laid in shallow water, as
they are frequently displaced or broken from this cause. A large field of
shore ice enclosing a surface crib may do considerable damage when it
moves out, as was the case at the new Cleveland crib. Ice fields coming
from the open lake are broken up and have not the force that a field of
shore ice has when it first starts to move. Submerged intakes along the
west shore of Lake Michigan have frequently been disturbed. In water less
than thirty feet in a large lake there is very little choice between surface
and submerged intakes, so far as surface ice is concerned. Snow and needle
ice, when driven by wind, have the same effect as surface ice on the shore
against which they pile up. Ice of this kind seldom reaches a depth exceed-
ing thirty to thirty-five feet.
Frazil or needle ice causes sorrow in large lakes, small lakes, rivers
and reservoirs. It is composed of crystals of ice formed in open water.
These crystals have a specific gravity of about 0.91 and are little, if any,


heavier than ordinary ice. If they are formed in quiet water, they imme-
diately unite to form surface ice; but if formed in a flowing river or any
agitated water, they are prevented from immediately uniting and are carried
below the surface ice by eddies and currents. In a river the crystals so
formed consist of spicules of ice about the size and shape of a six-inch lead
pencil and thin sheets no thicker than paper, which soon permeate the entire
body of water. Experiments on the St. Lawrence River with very delicate
instruments have demonstrated that the temperature of water at such times
is never more than 0.01° F. below the freezing point, and is the same at
all depths. When the water rises in temperature 0.01° aove the freezing
point, the crystals of ice begin to disappear. In bodies of quiet water such
as lakes and reservoirs, the depth to which crystals will descend appears to
depend solely upon the depth to which surface agitation by the wind is felt.
Frazil or needle ice is never formed where there is surface ice, although
it is often carried under surface ice for a considerable distance in the case
of rivers. In the St Lawrence it has been carried, in some instances, ten
or twelve miles, and when reaching quiet water has floated to the surface,
attaching itself to the under side of surface ice, and formed in great hanging
masses sometimes eighty or ninety feet deep. The winter floods at Montreal
are due to the contracted waterway caused by such masses of needle ice.
In the case of waterworks intakes, it requires only a very slight current to
draw particles of ice down from the surface. A velocity of only 0.2 foot
gives a velocity-head sufficient to overcome the specific gravity of a particle
of ice 0.016 inch thick; and as the particles of ice are frequently in the form
of very thin flakes, they will be drawn against screens even at this low
velocity. A velocity of one foot per second is sufficient to overcome the
buoyancy of a particle of ice 0.42 inch thick. It is usually recommended that
the mean velocity through intake ports be not greater than about 0.5 foot
per second. Particles of ice. when drawn against a screen, are difficult
to dislodge; rakes, mechanical scrapers, moving bars, chains, ice elevators,
compressed air, and steam, have all been used to accomplish this purpose.
The most effective way to overcome difficulty from needle ice in the case
of deep lakes, is to build submerged intakes at a depth of forty feet or
more; it appears that needle ice never reaches that depth except in the case
of rivers. The new submerged intake at Milwaukee has forty-six feet of
water over the top of the strainer bars; the crib at Duluth has fifty-six feet
of water over the top of the strainer bars; and the crib at Toronto is in
eighty feet of water. These have never been troubled with either surface
ice, needle ice or anchor ice. In smaller bodies of water a less depth
would be effective; and in reservoirs a platform of sufficient area placed
above the intake will often distribute the velocity and prevent needles of ice
from descending. Where feasible, submerged intakes are greatly to be pre-
ferred as compared with surface cribs, on account of their smaller first cost
and low maintenance charges; they are not suitable, however, for rivers
where needle ice reaches to the bottom, no matter how great the depth may
be. This is especially true for large cities. In the case of small towns, air
or steam may sometimes be successfully employed to free a submerged
strainer, even in a river where the needles of ice are floating like so much
waterlogged sawdust. Air pipes are apt to freeze up on the inside and
steam cannot be carried very far on account of condensation. A reversed
current of water from the pumps is sometimes effective.
Anchor ice is ice which forms upon submerged bodies, due to the radi-
ation of heat which takes place through water and air into space. This
form of ice does not occur at depths exceeding about forty feet. Unlike
needle ice, it sometimes occurs underneath surface ice, but only when the


surface ice is thin and clear. Anchor ice forms more readily upon dark
substances than upon those of lighter color; iron especially is subject to
heat radiation, and for that reason wooden strainers are preferable. True
anchor ice is largely supplemented by needle ice, which is readily attached
thereto. Anchor ice sometimes forms on the bottom of a river to a depth
of two or three feet; in such cases it is made up to a considerable extent
of crystals and is spongy in its nature. Anchor ice has the same specific
gravity as other ice, and rises to the surface as soon as it has attained suffi-
cient thickness to lift the object to which it is attached. Anchor ice does
not form when the sun is shining, and a few hours of sun are sufficient to
detach it from stones at the bottom of a river or from intake cribs; in fact,
there is usually no trouble at all with waterworks intakes when the sun is
shining, as at such times needle ice readily passes through the strainer bars
and enters the intake pipe or conduit. Stoppage never occurs in brick con-
duits, although needle ice in large quantities may pass through; stoppage
sometimes occurs however on the inside of wrought or cast-iron intake
pipes, where they are exposed to radiation. In the case of the Detroit
tunnel, it is estimated that the heat which will be absorbed from the sur-
rounding soil will be sufficient in one hour to melt a coating of ice about
o.os mm- thick.
A reservoir is one of the best safeguards against water famine from
ice in the strainers.
Following this article will be found an index of literature upon the
general subject of ice formation and trouble, so far as the writer has been
able to compile it.

THE ELECTRON THEORY.
DR. K. E. CUTHE.
The electron theory, which has lately attracted so much attention
among scientists may be called the third stage of the development of our
theories concerning phenomena connected with electro-magnetic action.
At the beginning of the second half of the nineteenth century Wilhelm
Weber explained the electromagnetic phenomena known at that time, per-
fectly satisfactorily, by assuming the existence of two different kinds of
electrical fluids, ». e., positive and negative electricity. Electricity could be
divided into small particles—atoms of electricity Weber calls them,—which
act upon one another through space, these actions being transmitted with
infinite velocity. The idea of the electrical atom, however, did not at that
time lead to attempts to measure its size. Many of our definitions and
modes of speaking of electrical phenomena date back to Weber's theory.
It was Faraday's master mind which pointed out the short-comings of
this theory and emphasized the great role which the medium plays in all
electrical phenomena. Then Maxwell in his great treatise gave the
mathematical basis for the electromagnetic theory of light, and Hertz by
his famous researches proved that electromagnetic action is not an action
at a distance but transmitted by the ether. The possibility of treating the
phenomena of light and those of electromagnetic waves from the same
point of view, led physicists to abandon Weber's theory and look to the
ether and the lines of force, i. c, the stresses produced in the ether, for the
solution of all future problems in electromagnetism. According to Max-
well's theory there are no atoms of electricity. We have a continuous ether
with certain electrical and magnetic properties and these properties may
be modified by the presence of matter.
Now the third period in the development of the electrical theory which
may be characterized by the name of the electron theory, means a return,
at least to a certain extent, to the ideas of the first, or better a combination
of the two, t. e., we have to allow a right of existence as well to the atoms
of electricity as to the continuous ether with its electrical and magnetic
stress properties.
In fact the "electric charge" has always been a more or less definite
something, which has never allowed itself to be pushed aside entirely in an
important branch of electricity, namely, in electrolysis. All attempts to
explain electrolytic action on the basis of ether stress have found hardly
any adherents among the physicists and we are accustomed to say that in
electrolytes certain small particles of matter are charged with a definite
amount of either positive or negative electricity, a combination which we
call an "ion." When a current goes through a cell, the electric charge is
given off at the electrode. It is apparent that, at least during the short
time of transference, we think of the charge as having a separate existence.
The smallest quantity of electricity found in electrolysis is then that
amount which is carried by a monavalent ion—How large is it? We
know that one gram-equivalent of an ion, say I gram of H, carries very
nearly 96600 coulombs. The ratio of the charge in electromagnetic


units to the mass of hydrogen is then apparently 9660 or nearly
1 X 10*. The number of gas-molecules in 1 cm' at o" and 760 mm/cm'
pressure of mercury is about 4 X 10". As an example, take hydrogen.
Each molecule is made up of 2 atoms, we have therefore in each cubic
centimeter about 8 X 10" atoms. One grammolecule occupies 22,350 cm', i.e.,
there are 178800 X 10" atoms in 2 grs. of H. These carry 2 X 96600 coul-
combs, so each ion has a charge of ^ —a = 1.1 X io-'9 coul. =
1.1 X 10-20 electromagnetic units. Since an electromagnetic unit of
quantity of electricity is 3 X 10" larger than the corresponding electro-
static unit, we obtain from the consideration of electrolytic phenomena for
the electrostatic charge of a monovalent ion, about 3.3 X io-10 units.
Even in the electromagnetic theory of light where the wonderful suc-
cess of Maxwell's theory seemed at first to leave no room for separate
electrical charges, they began slowly to gain more and more ground. It
was soon found that certain phenomena of light, c. g. radiation from incan-
descent vapors or the absorption of light by certain substances, and especi-
ally the dispersion of light, demanded a definite structure of bodies. Max-
well, von Helmholtz and others assumed that the material particles emitting
light of definite wave length possess one or more distinct periods of vibra-
tion and will consequently act like resonators for these vibration fre-
quencies and therefore absorb their energy. Thus the material particles
whose atoms carry positive and negative charges, were supposed to create
by'their vibrations electromagnetic disturbances of the ether.
H. A. Lorentz of the University of Leyden assumed as early as 1880
that not the material atoms of the substance but only an electric charge con-
nected with it and having a vibration period of its own, produces the elec-
tromagnetic phenomena of light. Starting from this hypothesis he was
able to explain by means of a formidable structure of mathematical for-
mula? the apparent exceptions to Maxwell's theory. But Lorentz's greatest
success was to come 16 years later; his theory, similarly to Maxwell's, had
to wait for an experimental proof.
Let us see whether his theory could predict effects of magnetic and
electrostatic fields on light rays, which had not been observed before and
which, by being found, would of course strengthen it. We suppose, with
Lorentz, that the small electrical charges which we shall from now on call
"electrons," a name first used by Stoney, swing rapidly about a point of
rest and by their influence upon the ether produce light radiation. Let
such an electron, which we consider as a negative charge, after it has left
its position of rest, be subjected to an elastic force pulling it back. It will
swing then in a simple harmonic motion in a straight line and produce
light of a definite wave length. But now suppose we bring this swinging
electron into a strong magnetic field. A moving electrical charge will be
acted upon as a flexible current would, »'. e., if we suppose the magnetic
lines of force to go from the front vertically through the plane of the paper
and a negative electrical charge to start from the point P (see figure),
vertically down parallel to the plane of the paper, it would instead of going
to A be deflected to the left so as to describe the path PB. After having
reached its maximum elongation at B, it will return to its position of rest,
but on a path concave towards the right and thus describe a loop. Con-
structing the path it takes during several vibrations, it will reach the points
C, D, E, eta, the width of the loop depending on the strength of the mag-


netic field. We are accustomed to consider a motion in a loop as this as
the resultant of two separate motions, say one in a vertical direction along
AZ and one at right angles to it, along PS.
The question arises: What kind of light will be emitted from an elec-
tron moving in the manner described? Let'us take the direction PS as
the direction of propagation of the light. Light vibrations are always at
right angles to its direction of propagation, i. e., we must suppose that only
the component at right angles to PS can be propagated in this direction as
light, but not the component parallel to it
It is apparent that the vibrations parallel to AZ will alternately increase
and decrease in amplitude. In sound we are perfectly familiar with such
phenomena: we say we have "beats," whose effect is the same as if two vi-
brations with somewhat different periods were present. Our eye is not sen-
sitive enough to see these extremely rapid light beats, but in using a spec-
troscope we should expect two lines of distinct wave length corresponding
to these beats. Moreover, according to the theory of light ether vibrations at
right angles to the plane of the paper would also be propagated as light
rays in the direction PS, but on these the magnetic field has no influence,
». e., their amplitude remains constant. We shall therefore see in the spec-
troscope also a line between the other two, this line corresponding to the
natural wave length of the light emitted by the body. The effect of bringing
a body emitting under ordinary circumstances light of a certain wave
length into a strong magnetic field and looking at it through a spectroscope
in a direction at right angles to the magnetic lines of force, is therefore,
that we see instead of the usual one bright line now a triplet of bright lines.
This phenomenon, which Lorents's theory demanded, has been found exper-
imentally by Zeeman in 1896; it is the famous "Zeeman effect." Various
bright lines emitted by incandescent vapours have been studied under
these conditions, and Zeeman has calculated from the mathematical theory
the ratio e/m of the electrical charge to the mass of such a vibrating elec-


tron. For each of the two D lines he found it to be 1.6 X ioT electromag-
netic units per gram, for the Cadmium line 2.4 X io*. Comparing this
result with what we found above for the same ratio in electroytic phe-
nomena, namely about 1 X 10*, we obtain the very surprising result that it
is in this case more than a thousand times larger.
Thus Zeeman, by his famous discovery, strengthened considerably the
electron theory introduced by Lorents into the electromagnetic theory of
light.
While the new electron theory was originated in connection with
Maxwell's theory, its importance was seen more clearly when purely elec-
trical phenomena also demanded the existence of electrons. I refer to the
interesting results obtained by the study of "Cathode rays." These rays
are emitted from the negative electrode of a Crooke's tube, when worked
with an induction coil; they travel in straight lines, can be deflected by a
strong magnet and produce at an object which they meet in their path the
same effect which small particles of matter would if moving with great
velocity. Crooke's hypothesis that these rays were charged gas molecules
repelled from the electrode, had to be given up as soon as quantitative
measurements of the ratio between the electrical quantity transferred and
the corresponding amount of matter were made. Closely connected with
these measurements are the names of Wicchert, J. J. Thomson, Kaufmann,
Lenard and others. Their investigations have led to the result that in
cathode rays this ratio e/m equals about 1.85 X K?, i. e., the same number
as the one found for electrons emitting light.
Several different methods may be employed to calculate the ratio, the
simplest one being the following:
If we have a strong magnetic field of strength H at right angles to the
direction of the moving electrons, the force with which the charge is
deflected from its rectilinear path equals Hev, where e is the charge on
one electron and v its velocity. Acting against this force we have the cen-
trifugal force = mv'/r and a steady deflection is obtained when the two are
equal to each other, i. e., Hev = mv'/r, r = mv/eH where m is the mass
of the particle. The electron describes therefore the arc of a circle whose
radius is r = mv/eH. Now H and r may be measured and thus mv/e
found. To eliminate v let an electrostatic and a magnetic field at right
angles to each other act at the same time upon the moving electron and
adjust the strength of these fields so as to have one just balance the effect
of the other. The force on an electric charge e in an electrostatic field of
strength F is Fe, therefore under the given conditions Fe = evH or
v = F/H. Substituting this value of v in the above equation we obtain
v = mF/eH* or e/m = F/vH*. Now we have on the right hand side only
quantities which we can measure. By this or similar methods a great
many observers have found the velocity of the cathode rays to be from
0.3 to 0.9 X to10 cm/sec or about 1/10 to 1/3 that of light, while e/m by the
most accurate methods was found to be about 1.85 X 10' electromagnetic
units. The most important result, however, is that for different gases this
ratio does not change, i. e., "the electrons seem to form an invariable con-
stituent of the atoms or molecules of all gases and presumably of all
liquids and solids" (/. /. Thomson). To carry a given charge of elec-
tricity through an electrolyte requires therefore a mass at least 1000 times
greater than if the carriers are cathode rays.
The question whether there are positive electrons has also been inves-
tigated. If in a Crooke's tube the negative electrdde is perforated, the
positively charged atoms pass through these holes and form the so-called
"canal-rays." W. Wien has found that for these positively charged par-
3


tides the ratio of the charge to the mass is the same or even smaller than
that for electrolytes. In other words the canal-rays are produced by
"ions" and not by "electrons," the latter being characterized by the large
ratio e/m. Real electrons with a positive charge have not been found as
yet.
We cannot leave this part of the subject without mentioning other
occurrences of electrons. A part of the "Becqueral rays" are of the same
nature as cathode rays. These rays emanate as Becquerel first discovered
from certain Uranium salts, and they led to th,e discovery of the new
elements Radium (and Polonium?) by M. and Mme. Curie. These
elements send out among others very strong invisible rays which are not
stopped even by thin sheets of metal, and at first were thought to be
similar to "Rontgen rays."
But as soon as Dorn and Becquerel had shown them to be deflected by
a strong magnetic field, it became apparent that they belong to the same
class as cathode rays. Measurements similar to those described above
gave for the velocity of these very penetrating Becquerel rays from 2 to
2.8 X io10 cm/sec, i. e., almost as large as the velocity of light, while e/m
did not differ much from the ratio found for cathode rays. But in this case,
and this is of the greatest importance for the development of the electron
theory, Kaufmann has found that the ratio e/m depends for these electrons
travelling with such enormous velocity upon their speed, being the larger
the greater the velocity. Another part of the Becquerel rays, namely those
which are easily absorbed and called the a-rays, have lately been investi-
gated by Rutherford and Becquerel, who found their velocity = 0.2 X i°"
cm/sec and e/m = 6X io". They are therefore very similar to the canal
rays and probably positively charged atoms.
Electrons appear however to be much more frequent than in the iso-
lated cases which we have thus far considered. In fact conduction of
electricity in gases seems always to be due to the presence of electrons.
They may be produced in a number of ways. If you illuminate a charged
conductor by Rontgen rays, Becquerel rays, or ultraviolet light, it will lose
its charge. Bodies heated to bright red heat or still higher send out elec-
trons. But the most efficient means is through a violent electrical impulse
as in the case of cathode-rays.
The result of all these experiments is that electrons, or negatively
charged particles exist, in which the ratio of the charge to the mass is more
than 1000 times larger than it is for a hydrogen ion. A question of greatest
importance is: Is the mass of one electron that of an atom, carrying a
very much larger amount of electricity than it can in electrolytic action, or
is the charge, connected with each particle, the same as that connected
with a monovalent ion and is its mass less than the one-thousandth part of
that of an hydrogen atom? J I. Thomson has solved this question in a
most ingenious way. If a moist ionized or better electronized gas is
expanded adiabatically the water condenses in drops around the ions as
nuclei. If the proper proportion between the water and the ions is chosen
the number of water drops equals the number of ions. As Stokes has
shown, the radius of each drop of water can be measured by the velocity
with which a fog formed by the drops sinks down. From the radius and
the total amount of water present the number of drops can be calculated.
/. /. Thompson found by this method for the charge of each drop, i. e., each
electron 1.14 X 10-*° electromagnetic or 3.4 X icr«&lt;» electrostatic units, or
nearly the same value for each charge as we found for each ion. This
charge may therefore be called the smallest quantity of electricity existing,
or an atom of electricity; and it may be of interest to know that M. Planck


has found practically the same number, 4.60. X io-»° electrostatic units, from
his theoretical studies on the distribution of energy between ether and mat-
ter. On the other hand it follows that the mass of an electron is smaller
than the one-thousandth part of a hydrogen atom. According to /. /.
Thomson, the so-called ionisation of a gas consists then in a separation of
the negatively charged corpuscle, as he calls it, from the remaining part
of the atom or molecule, which is left charged positively; with other
words, positive electrification consists in the absence of these corpuscles
from ordinary atoms.
But here the theory cannot stop. A separate mass so much smaller
than what we have always supposed to be the smallest and indivisible part
of matter, is something so new that it is natural, physicists should have
tried to explain away entirely this last trace of matter left in the electrons.
And surely in considering the problem before us, we must all acknowledge
that at least a part of this mass can be only apparent. Let us follow
O. Lodge in his clear statement of the case, given only a few months ago
before the Institution of Electrical Engineers in England.
A moving charged particle is equivalent to an electric current whose
strength depends of course upon the velocity of the particle. A magnetic
field is set up around an electric current. If the motion starts in, i. e.,
while the charge receives an acceleration, the strength of the magnetic field
increases, and by electromagnetic induction a counter E. M. F. is produced,
which according to Lena's law acts so as to oppose the action producing
the magnetic field, •'. e., we have here something which seems to hold the
particle back. If the motion is suddenly stopped, induction would tend to
continue the motion. We have therefore here something very similar to
the inertia of a moving material body opposing mechanical acceleration.
But in our case the phenomenon is due entirely to the electromagnetic
induction produced by the electrical charge alone, not by mass. It is
clear therefore that whatever inertia a moving material body would have
due to its amount of matter, it will surely have a larger inertia and there-
fore a larger apparent mass in virtue of being charged with electricity.
Hcaviside has calculated the energy of a moving charge to be, Energy =
ft e* u'/^r, where ft is the magnetic permeability of the medium, e the elec-
trostatic charge, u its velocity and r the radius of the sphere on which the
charge is supposed to be distributed. This kinetic energy measured in
mechanical units would be represented by Yt m' u' where m is the apparent
mass, or y2 tri u' = ft e* u'/3r and m' == ft p e'/r. We may change the
expression slightly. The potential of a sphere of radius r in a medium
whose dielectric constant is K, is V = e/rK, so the apparent mass is m' =
33 P K e e/rK = ttfK eV. Now the ratio of the electromagnetic unit of
quantity of electricity equals 3 X l°" cm. per sec. {i.e., velocity of light),
and also equals \Sft K, so by denoting the velocity of light by v, we have
m' = y3v'eV.
The potential energy of the charge e measured in electrostatic units is
Yi e V. But if we have instead of the charge a material particle of mass m'
moving with the speed of light, its kinetic energy would be Yi m' S =
y3 e V = ft (Yi e V). If a material body having a mass equal to the appar-
ent mass of the moving charge were traveling with the velocity of light, its
kinetic energy would be two thirds the potential energy of the electrical
charge when standing still.
Let a sphere be charged to one volt by a quantity of one coulomb. The
electrostatic E. M. F. is 3 X io1* larger than the corresponding electromag-
netic unit, but the ratio is just reversed for the units of quantity of
electricity, therefore the electrostatic energy corresponding to * V is the


same as the electromagnetic energy of one volt coulomb, namely ioT ergs. Its
apparent mass would be J3 107(9 X iff) =2/27 X iO"'S gr. = io-'« mg.,
a very small mass indeed. As we saw above, the charge on one ion is
io-'o electrostatic units. The radius of an atom is about 10-8 cm., so the
electrostatic potential of an ion is 0.01 electrostatic units = 0.01 X 3 X io10=:
3 X io8 electromagnetic units = 3 volts. Its apparent mass due to the charge
which we may assume as 14 X io-»9 coulombs m' = io-'4.10-19 = 10-33
grams. Comparison with the mass of a hydrogen atom, 10-25 grams, shows
it is negligible.
In the case of an electron there is, however, no necessity to assume
the radius to be as large as that of an atom; on the contrary, it is probable
that it is very much smaller than that. Therefore, supposing it to be io-'3
cm. instead of 10-8 cm., its potential would be 1000 electrostatic units =
300000 volts, and its apparent mass m' = 10-28 grams, or about one one-
thousandth of that of an hydrogen atom.
The apparent mass of an electron, found experimentally, would follow
directly from the assumption that the charge is distributed over a sphere
of a very small radius, and under these conditions the supposition that the
charge is connected to a material particle is entirely unnecessary. This
way of looking at the subject has been strengthened by mathematical
deductions and experiments of very recent date. Some time ago it was
shown by Heaviside that for a charge moving with a velocity smaller than
that of light, e. g., the electrons of the cathode rays, its apparent mass will
always bear the same ratio to the charge, independent of the velocity, but
that the mass would appear larger if the velocity increases and approxi-
mates that of light. Now, as was mentioned before, the Becquerel rays
travel much faster than ordinary cathode rays and reach J4 of the speed of
light. So while the cathode rays show always the same ratio e/m, we
should expect an increase of the apparent mass with the velocity for the
Becquerel rays, and this has actually been found by Kaufmann.
Besides, theoretical calculations published a month or two ago by
Abraham, which were based on the supposition that the so-called mass of
the electrons is due only to the inertia effect produced by a rapidly moving
electric charge without any mass, led to equations which when compared
with Kaufmann's results showed a complete agreement between theory
and experiment.
The temptation to extend now these ideas still further is very great
indeed. _ So we must expect in the near future attempts to explain matter
as consisting simply of conglomerates of moving electrons, and this would
lead us finally to assume as the framework of our universe a continuous
ether and imbedded in it the electrons which by the particular manner of
combination and motion give rise to the effects we now attribute to mat-
ter. The first steps in this direction have been made. Let us hope it is in
the right direction and that the electron theory of matter will not in the
end prove to be a scientific mirage, which with all our efforts we will
never be able to reach.


SOME NOTES ON THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION
OF SUBMERGED WATER PIPES.
GEORGE F. FENKEIX.
In nearly all water works systems it is found necessary to lay one
or more lines of submerged pipe. Ordinary wrought iron pipe with screw
joints is frequently used for small sizes, and the ease with which it can
be placed frequently more than balances all its objectionable features.
Some of the pipes which were laid several year ago to convey natural gas
from Canada across the Detroit river to the city of Detroit, about 8 or 10
inches in diameter, were screwed together on shore and pulled into position
by means of a line attached to locomotives on the opposite shore. The
river at this point is about 3,000 feet wide, and about 500 feet of pipe was
coupled up at a time, and when this was nearly all drawn into the water
another 500 feet was added on, and so on.until the pipe reached from shore
to shore. During the prosecution of the work the forward end of the
pipe was buoyed up to prevent its entering the clay in the bottom of the
river.
As the size of the pipe increases the difficulty and expense of making
screw joints also increases, and it therefore becomes necessary to find
other methods for connecting the pipes and placing them in position. In
1896 seven lines of 18-inch pipe with screw joints were laid across the
Passaic river at Belleville, N. J.,1 in somewhat the same manner as the
gas pipes at Detroit, but 12-inch pipe seems to be as large as is ordinarily
employed when screw joints are used, as the pipe is greatly weakened in
the process of threading.
Various methods have been proposed for joining steel and wrought
iron pipes together under water, and in Plate A' several styles of joints
are shown, most of which may be used in laying a submerged line. In
Fig. 2 the metal is increased at the joint to allow for threading, and Figs.
9 and 10 are rigid flanged joints. With the exception of the joints shown
in Figs. 1 and 9 the writer does not know where these were used or with
what success. The joint used at Detroit and mentioned later much re-
sembles that shown in Fig. 10.
Seldom are pipe lines straight from end to end. Steam pipes and
occasionally water pipes are carried for short distances in straight lines,
having all the joints made with rigid flanges, but slight deviations in laying
water pipe in a trench on shore can be made in the lead joint of cast iron
pipe, and steel or wrought iron pipe will adapt itself to slight changes in
grade. With submerged lines, unless the pipe itself is flexible, some
arrangement must be introduced to allow it to deflect sufficiently to con-
NoTE—The sketches which accompany this article are drawn without
regard to scale.

Pipe," read by D. J. Russell before the American Water Works Asso-
ciation, April, 1891, and printed in Engineering Record, May 9, 1891.

form to the slope of its bed. Many forms of joints and methods of placing
have been proposed during the past few years, and with such gratifying
success, in some cases, that firms have been organized for the manufacture
of certain kinds of joints. Others have engaged in the placing of the pipe
in position by methods and apparatus of peculiar design and construction.
It will be found, however, that usually the pipes are first fixed together
into straight lengths, sometimes more than ioo feet long. These sections,
which are rigid and unyielding from end to end, are connected together
with some form of flexible joint which permits more or less deviation in
alignment, and where great care is taken in forming the bed on which the
pipe is to rest, several sections may sometimes be joined together under
water by means of flanges and gaskets,and only a few flexible joints used in
the entire line. In laying steel pipe the sections are usually riveted together
into one continuous piece, although this is not necessary. A cast iron
pipe line is made of sections composed of standard lengths joined together
on shore with the ordinary hub and spigot joint caulked with lead. Some-
times, where the grade is uneven, a single 12-foot length of cast iron pipe
can be used with a flexible joint at each end.
In Plate B, Fig. 1, is shown a section of the flexible joint patented some
years ago by John F. Ward* and since known as "Ward's Joint." It has
been used quite extensively and much the same joint, slightly modified in
detail was used at Atlantic City in 1902 for laying 20-inch cast iron pipe.*
By referring to the figure it will be seen that after the joint is placed and
slightly deflected the lead cannot be caulked if leaks should be discovered.
Only part of the lead filling has a bearing surface, as that part projecting
beyond the bell is useless.
The joint used by the Metropolitan Water Board in 18955 for 36-inch
cast iron pipe is shown in, Plate B, Fig. 2. Unlike the Ward joint the
lead remains fixed to the hub and the spigot is turned off to the surface of
a spherical zone. In this joint the lead may be caulked at any time if leaks
are discovered, but as with the Ward joint the lead is all that prevents the
spigot from coming out of the hub. Although this may not cause trouble
when the line is laid so that it can not change its alignment, yet if not
well secured the joints are liable to blow open.
The Walker ball joint shown in Plate B, Fig. 3, permits of consider-
able deviation, but when once the pipe is in place and the joint has adapted
itself to the necessary angle, the bolts are tightened and the joint then
becomes practically rigid.
Where considerable deflection is necessary at one point in large steel
or wrought iron pipes the joint shown in Plate C, Fig 1, has proved very
satisfactory, judging from the extent of its use. There is no reason why
it could not be equally as well applied to cast iron pipe. The one shown
in the figure mentioned was used at Syracuse, N. Y.,* and much the same
style joint has been used at Toronto, and at Rochester, N. Y.* It is a
question whether this joint would remain tight under pressure, and if leaks
were found, whether the lead could be caulked tight.
The joints shown in Plate C, Figs. 2 and 3, do not allow as much

deflection as many of the others shown, but they afford an easy and cheap
method of joining cast iron pipes together under water. When once in
place the pipes are held tight and rigid by the various bolts. The joint is
first made on shore, the spigot is then withdrawn from the hub and
reunited under water. The one shown in Fig. 2" was used in 1895 at Erie,
Pa., for laying about 8,200 feet of submerged 60-inch cast iron pipe in
a dredged trench in Erie harbor. The sections were 72 feet 10 inches in
length. The same method of tapering the spigot was employed by the
Metropolitan Water Board in 1895.* The joint shown in Fig. 3 was used
at Milwaukee,10 and also at Erie. It will be noticed that the lead in
Fig. 3 projects out slightly beyond the face of the hub, while the lead in
Fig. 2 is flush with the face of the hub. The latter is, however, easily
caulked by a diver.
Plate C, Fig. I, also shows the method employed at Syracuse for
uniting the sections together and allows of some deflection. The joint
shown in Plate C, Fig. 4, was used on a 60-inch intake at Detroit in 1890
and has not proven entirely satisfactory. The lugs through which the bolts
pass have sometimes broken off, and subsequent examinations have proven
that the joints are liable to leak.
It is impossible to lay a submerged line of pipe with the same care
and exactness that could be obtained if laid above water. It therefore
becomes necessary to test all lines so laid to detect leaks. Compressed air
may be employed to advantage in locating leaks provided emptying the
pipe will not cause it to float. Ordinary cast iron pipe, up to and including
20 inches in diameter, will not float when entirely emptied. A 24-inch pipe
with metal less than about 0.85 inches thick will float when empty, as will
also a 30-inch pipe with less than about 1.07 inches of metal, a 36-inch
pipe with less than about 1.29 inches and a 42-inch pipe with less than
about 1.50 inches, provided the pipes are not weighted or otherwise
fastened down. The above dimensions may vary slightly, as the exact
thickness at which the weight of the pipe will equal its displacement
depends on the form of the hub and weight of the joint. All ordinary
classes of 48-inch, 54-inch and 60-inch cast iron pipe will float when filled
with air.
Some joints proposed and apparatus invented for laying submerged
pipe base their claims for superiority on being able to do all the work
above water. It seems to the writer, however, that the use of flexible
joints weakens the line and that in order to secure a first class job a
diver should be employed and a style of joint adopted which can be made
rigid by bolts, and if need be, caulked after the pipe has adapted itself to
the bed prepared for it.

WHY ENGINEERS SHOULD ADVERTISE.
GEO. H. GIBSON, '99, ADVERTISING MANAGER B. F. STURTEVANT CO.
We hear much nowadays about the dignity, the honor and the glory of
the engineering profession. At the same time the correspondence columns
of the technical journals are filled with complaints concerning the meagre
compensation usually received by engineers. These things do not harmon-
ize. If the engineers, by virtue of their skill, ability and integrity, are in-
dispensable in this industrial age, why are they not better paid? There are
but two classes of people who can be held responsible for this state of
affairs, viz.: the engineers themselves and their employers, the public.
Some of the blame rests upon each, but most of it upon the engineers.
In the first place, most people, including many otherwise well informed,
have a very hazy notion of what an engineer is and what he does. They
perhaps think of him as somewhere between a highly skilled mechanic, or
artisan, and a professional man consulted as an expert in cases of dire neces-
sity. They rarely regard him as a man of affairs, capable of directing and
conducting large enterprises. That this is the case is shown very clearly by
the attitude of state and municipal governments towards engineers and their
salaries. For instance, the wealthy state of New York advertises for engin-
eering assistants in the office of the State Engineer, offering the munificent
salary of $5.00 per day for days actually worked, nothing for overtime.
Bricklayers in many cities are paid $5.20 for eight hours labor and double
pay for overtime. The "buyers" of department stores often receive more
than $2,000 per year. Again, Kansas City, Mo., is making important and
costly additions to its water supply system. In connection with this work
three Consulting Engineers have been retained. In spite of the fact that the
advice of these men may result in the loss or the saving to the city of
thousands of dollars, the Kansas City "Journal" complains that one "has
been added to the city pay-roll at a salary of $1,500 a year and anointed with
title of "Consulting Engineer," and that the services of the others "cost the
city $15.00 every time they blink an eye," that is, they are paid $15.00 per day
when their services are required. No large city would think of employing
legal talent at wages 50 small and at the same time nearly every municipality
is engaged in engineering undertakings upon which the profit or loss due to
good or poor engineering judgment and skill may amount up into the
thousands or even millions of dollars. Due to poor engineering, or the ab-
sence of any at all, hundreds of lives annually are lost from typhoid fever in
some of our large cities, a loss which could be almost entirely prevented by
the application of well-known engineering methods.
Now it is plain that the only way in which public opinion in regard to
these matters can be reformed is by education, and it is equally plain upon
whom rests the responsibility of doing the educating. The engineers must
speak for themselves. They must educate the public in engineering mat-
ters. It is as much to the interest of engineers as of lawyers or bankers to
take an interest and part in public affairs and to educate and direct public
opinion. The engineer should advertise the engineering profession for the
good of both the profession and the public. A beginning has been made in
this by engineers like Kent, Thurston, and others, who have sought to bring
to public attention the great revolution in the industrial and social world
being brought about by the activities of the engineer. Much is also to be


expected from the efforts of those, notably Mr. C. F. Scott, now president
of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, who are endeavoring to
draw the national engineering societies together into a united, harmonious
and powerful body. Since the above was written, Mr. Carnegie's generous
offer of $1,000,000 to erect a building in New York city for the national
engineering societies has placed this movement upon a substantial footing.
The timeliness and importance of such movements are manifest when
we consider that fifty years hence the engineer will probably hold a position
of vast power and influence in the social organism. His work touches organ-
ization, financiering, management and, ultimately, statesmanship. He is
forced to study political economy thoroughly and at first hand. He is des-
tined to become and is becoming the leader of vast industrial organizations
and, perhaps eventually, of the world itself. In the beginning the world was
superstitious and ignorant and its rulers were priests; these were followed
by soldiers who have disciplined it, and these again by lawyers, who have
established the principles of civil rights. The great questions of the present
and future are industrial and commercial. Science and invention should
naturally, it would seem, place the sources of wealth and power in the
hands of the engineers, who should next hold the reins. This is not to be
understood in any absolute or revolutionary sense, but it is to be noted that
the professionally trained engineer is more and more becoming a man of
affairs. His active life, exacting duties, accurate habits of thought, earnest-
ness and integrity fit him to be the leader and adviser of men.
However, our exultation in the bright prospects of the engineering pro-
fession has perhaps caused us meanwhile to forget the individual engineer.
As above pointed out, his pay is not always commensurate with his pros-
pects and he cannot live comfortably upon prospects in general and nothing
in particular. His practice of "the art of directing the great sources of
power in nature for the use and convenience of man" is not always supple-
mented by the art of being well paid for that practice. It would seem that
there should be no great difficulty in selling at a good price services so
profitable to the purchaser as those of the engineer, but it appears that he
usually fails to do it.
Careful consideration of the subject seems to indicate that the limited
financial success of many technical men arises more from lack of business
perspective and enterprise than from anything else. First, they do not ad-
vertise enough. It is one of the first duties of every man to let the world
know what he is good for. Honest advertising pays both parties concerned.
If you can do a thing better than it is generally done, you should tell about
it. It may help someone else, but it will probably help you most, besides,
you don't need to give the whole secret away. In other words, engineers
should write articles for the technical press based upon their work, study or
observation. Such articles are valuable to refer to when applying for posi-
tions or soliciting work. They form the cheapest form of personal adver-
tising, since they are usually productive of revenue. Most technical papers
will gladly publish and pay for articles of any merit. Men are known for
their ideas and an idea properly disseminated has more advertising value
than a vast amount of money. A man of real enterprise, however, will not
stop with the technical press, but at opportune times will discuss in the pub'
lie press engineering and economic subjects of popular interest, such as the
purification of public water supplies, public transportation, the fuel situation,
gas and electric lighting, and many others of equal importance. The more
the world knows of engineering, the more it will need it. The progressive
engineer will also seek to belong to organizations which will bring him into


contact with business men and he will certainly become a member of the
local engineering society and one or more of the national organizations.
A further reason for the slow advancement of some engineers is that
they are not as wide-awake as they might be to opportunities for im^oving
their situation. Business men seek to sell their goods at the highest price
and the bestpossible terms. They are constantly on the outlook for new
customers. There is no reason why an engineer should not pursue the same
course in regard to his services, which are his goods. A personal applica-
tion or a carefully written letter does not cost much and may be the means
of a considerable advance. The discontented grumbling so often heard
among salaried men could well be replaced by a cheerful effort to find some-
thing better. The present will seem more bearable, the future more hopeful
and better work will be done. A safe rule for the beginner would be, first
catch your job and then get a better one.
The foregoing may be ridiculed as "get there" preachifying from one
who has not gotten so very far. The writer has, however, only endeavored
to apply the principles of successful business promotion to the personal pro-
motion of engineers, having in mind particularly the young engineers who
may read this article. Critics may also be reminded that we have Mr. Car-
negie's authority for the statement that thrift is a duty and a competence an
indispensable element of a happy life. A technical college education is de-
sirable for many ends other than money getting, but that is no good reason
why you should not make all the money out of it that you can.


SHOP AND OFFICE PRACTICE FOR THE PROTEC-
TION OF INVENTIONS.
DWIGHT B. CHEEVER, '91 ENG., '96 L., CHICAGO, ILL.
There is perhaps no subject connected with the business of any manu-
facturing corporation which is more important and which is less understood
and therefore has less attention paid to it than that of the proper perpetu-
ation of data relative to inventions made by employees of the company in
the regular course of business, and it is in the hope of giving fellow alumni
engineers, who have charge of the management of such companies or
departments therein, some suggestions in this direction, that this paper is
written.
The authority for the issue of a patent is statutory and the principal
section relating thereto is:
"Sec. 4886—Any person who has invented or discovered any
new and useful art, machine, manufacture, or composition of
matter, or any new and useful improvements thereof, not known
or used by others in this country, befcre his invention or discovery
thereof, and not patented or described in any printed publication
in this or any foreign country, before his invention or discovery
thereof, or more than two years prior to his application, and not in
public use or on sale in this country for more than two years prior
to his application, unless the same is proved to have been aban-
doned, may, upon payment of the fees required by law, and other
due proceeding had, obtain a patent therefor."
From the above statute it follows and is held by the courts that the first
diligent inventor is entitled to his patent, notwithstanding the fact that some
one else may have applied for a patent prior to his application or may even
have_ obtained a patent, and conversely, it follows that though a person has
obtained a paterrt, it is always subject to defeat by proof that the device
covered by the claims was in public use more than two years prior to his
application, or was shown in a printed publication in this or a foreign
country prior to his invention or more than two years prior to his
application.
The practical result of these legal propositions is, that an inventor
having any idea of protecting his invention by a patent, should establish,
as he goes along with his invention, data by which he can later, if called
upon, prove each specific stage of the invention, including the date; of
conception; of disclosure to others; of making the first drawing; of making
a model; of making a practical working machine and its first successful
commercial use. In the same way and for the same reasons where any
device is used and there is any suggestion of its being new and novel and
it is not desired to protect the same by patent, the same data and particu-
larly the date of complete commercial use should be preserved in order to
be able to prove the date of such use if sued by another patentee on a patent
issued to him for a machine covering the device in question. In order to
preserve data which can be itself offered in evidence and used to refresh
the memory of human witnesses, every inventor and every corporation


employing an inventor should establish rigid rules that every drawing of
prospective machines, including the mere rough pencil sketches, must be
dated and witnessed by two or more witnesses at the time made and filed
away, and all orders to shops for parts of such machines must contain
descriptive details sufficiently full and specific so that the man ordering the
part and the workman making it can afterwards identify it and give good
testimony relative to it, on reference to such order. If these parts so
ordered are made by third parties, bills, fully describing the parts in such a
way that the inventor and the manufacturer can, in after years, identify the
particular goods by reference to said bills, should be insisted on and care-
fully filed.
Special features of the invention which are considered particularly
valuable should be described in writing, if possible referring to the draw-
ings, the same signed, dated, witnessed and filed. If the reader is interested
in the subject an interesting example of such documents as suggested above,
which have passed successfully through the storm of litigation, may be seen
in the case of Von Schmidt v. Bowers, 80 Federal Reporter, p. 121 at pp.
129 and 130.
When the invention is complete, if it is desired to patent it, an applica-
tion should be prepared and filed in the Patent Office at the earliest possible
date. In practice, many companies file patent applications upon everything
Vhich has even the suspicion of novelty with the idea that the officially
recorded application at least, and the patent if issued, is worth all it costs
as an authoritative record, available in after years, to show that, at that
particular time, the invention described was in use by them (the fact of use
being proved by outside evidence, the witness refreshing his memory by the
application or patent), this, irrespective of the question whether or not the
patent if issued would be of much legal value to them in keeping others
from using the device.
The reader will appreciate the reasons for some of the above sugges-
tions if he will question himself and try to answer off-hand and give reasons
for the dates which he states, as to just when he bought the watch, the suit
of clothes, the cuff-buttons, the pocket-knife which he has or any one of
the hundreds of things about his room, and furthermore tries to say under
oath that any one of ihe articles, which is at all complicated and was bought
several years ago, contains all the parts which it contained when he bought
it, without any addition or substraction. There is nothing in professional
experience which impresses one with the general honesty of the American
people more than the hesitation of witnesses, particularly working men,
under oath, to swear definitely to dates relating to inventions they have
worked on or used unless they are assisted by bills, drawings, orders, diaries,
etc., as suggested above. Many, many times a witness before being put on
the stand to prove facts of invention five or ten years back, tells a straight
story, in a way that convinces the attorney he knows all about it and is
sincerely honest, and then, when put on the stand under oath, he qualifies
every answer with "I think so" or "I guess so" in a way which makes his
deposition absolutely worthless. If this same man had had some of the
data referred to above to refresh his memory he would have been able to
make his testimony positive and thereby perpetuate or defeat, as the case
may be, a very valuable invention. If engineers going out into or in actual
practice will take the trouble to see that some or all ofthese suggestions are
rigidly followed in their business, theywill find that, while in many cases
the matter will never be referred to again, the case will sooner or later arise
when their trouble, running through all the years, will be repaid many,
many times.


ANGLES IN SKEW CONNECTIONS IN STRUCTURAL
WORK.
C. G. WRENTMORE, 93-
This is not a difficult problem. On the contrary, it is so simple that no
draftsman with a working knowledge of the Descriptive Geometry of the
right line and plane should find the least trouble in it. However, since it is
the writer's experience that the average draftsman lacks this knowledge, he
takes the liberty of stating herein the application of a few first principles.
The problem has been very well solved by the method of spherical trigo-
nometry in the Eng. News of Feb. 15 and 22, 1900, by Mr. C. A. P. Turner,
and, as a matter of convenience in comparison, Mr. Turner's nomenclature
will be followed here. The angles which he works out are the following:
A = the angle between plane of roof and a horizontal plane.
B = the angle between the horizontal traces of the roof plane and the plane
of hip web.
/ = the angle between the hip rafter and the horizontal plane.
P = the angle in roof plane between a main rafter and hip rafter.
X = the angle between a vertical line and the trace of the purlin web upon
the hip web plane.
G = the angle between the roof plane and the back of hip.
V = angle in purlin web between a normal to center line of purlin and the
trace of hip web on purlin web.
M = complement of angle between purlin web and hip web
D = angle in back of hip between a line normal to hip web and the trace of
purlin web on back of hip.
P = comp of angle in purlin web between traces of hip web and back of hip.
B = angle between back of hip and purlin web.
In the above, by back of hip, hip web, and purlin web are meant the
plane of back of hip, etc.
The sketch shows two roofs in which horizontal lines run at right
angles, and which have slopes shown by the angles A and A'. Four planes
of projection are used, one a horizontal plane H, the other three vertical,
one the vertical plane of the hip web and the other two respectively perpen-
dicular to the H traces of the roof planes.
We have therefore three ground lines, LN, CK and OQ. The vertical
projection which is used for any particular solution is theoretically immate-
rial, but practically much time may be saved and much labor as well, by
choosing the correct one.
The angle A is given by the conditions of the problem. In many cases
it is a quarter pitch roof, but may be anything from a horizontal to a ver-
tical. In the sketch the angle A is quarter pitch and A' is third pitch.
The angle B — Assume any point K' in the roof line L K' at a height
NK' above H, and find the point K'" in the other roof line at the same
height, by making the length K'"y = NK'. Project these points to the
ground lines in N and y and through these H projections draw parallels to
the eave lines CO and CL, meeting at K. Then CK is the H projection of
the hip, and LCK the angle B for one roof and OCK the angle B' for the
other.


45
The angle /.—At K erect the line KK" normal to the ground line CK
and equal to NK'. CK" is the position of the hip revolved about CK into
H, and is the trace of each of the roof planes upon the vertical plane CK.
KCK" is the angle I.

The angle P.—Revolve the roof plane CLK' about its H trace CL into
H, at the same time revolving the line of the hip. SS1 is a point in the hip
which revolves to the position S". A main rafter is perpendicular to CL


in revolved position and the hip lies at CS". Therefore S"CO is the value
of P.
The angle X.—The plane of the purlin is taken normal to the plane of
the roof, its H trace being KN and its V trace NR1. A line in this plane
through Rf parallel to KN lies in the roof plane and cuts the line of the hip
at RR". KR" is the trace of the purlin on the V plane CK and RR" is a
vertical line in the same plane. RR"K is therefore the value of the angle X.
The angle G.—The roof plane and the back of the hip intersect in the
line of the hip CK — CK". The plane tTt' normal to this line, cuts the back
of the hip in a line parallel to its H trace tT, and cuts the roof in a line
which revolves about tT into H in the line tt". The angle G is therefore
the angle between tt" and a line parallel to tT, or the angle Ttt".
The angle V.—The intersection of hip and purlin webs is the line KR—
KR". Revolving this about the H trace of purlin web, KN, the point RR"
is found at /, and the line KR—KR" takes the position K/. R is revolved
by swinging R! about the center N into Nh and thence squaring across to
the line Rr drawn perpendicular to KN.
The angle R/K is the required value of V.
The angle M.—A plane perpendicular to the intersection of purlin web
and hip web, KR—KR' is assumed at uUu'. This cuts from the purlin web
a line which revolves into H at uu" and from hip web a line which revolves
into H in Uu". The angle between the planes is therefore shown at uu"U
and its complement at u uU, which is the angle M.
The angle D.—The plane of back of hip is aCK". It is cut by the purlin
web in a line from RR" to the intersection of the H traces aC and NK, the
line being shown horizontally in Rb and vertically in R"C. When this is
revolved about the H trace aC into H it falls at r 'd. A line normal to the
hip web will revolve into H in a parallel to aC. The angle between the line
r d and aC is therefore the angle D required.
The angle F.—The line Rb revolved about KN into H falls at e/. The
revolved position of KR as already found is Kr. The angle between these
lines, e/K, is therefore the value of the complement of the angle F.
The angle B.—The line of intersection of the two planes whose angle is
required is Rb. The horizontal projecting plane of this line is revolved
about Rb into H, the line Rb—R 'C then falling at rf. A plane normal to
both planes will have H trace gk, perpendicular to Rb, and its trace upon
the horizontal projecting plane of Rb is shown in revolved positions at hm.
If the plane gk be now revolved into H about gk as axis, the point in which
it cuts the line Rb—R"C falls at n, and the angles between the planes is
shown at gnk, which is the value of the angle B.
In work of this class where the greatest care must be exercised in
detailing work to provide against the the placing of two bodies in the same
place at the same time, in the opinion of the writer there is less probability
of error and greater probability of all clearances being provided for by the
graphical method than by the method of computation. Some experience
with skew work has led to the conclusion that where principal dimensions
are checked by computation a drawing to quarter size will give all secondary
dimensions with sufficient accuracy for all cases, both for angular and linear
measurements.
Drawings for this purpose, however, must be not only carefully, but
accurately done, and the draftsman must know his own limitations in the
matter of accurate work before he can determine how far his graphical
solutions are trustworthy.

BACK OK 10000 LINK TELEPHONE SWITCH-BOARD.


TELEPHONE ENGINEERING.
S. P. GRACE, '96.
In a modern common battery telephone system, when we remove the
receiver from the hook and presently hold conversation with someone a mile
or a thousand miles away, scarcely do we realize the vast amount of concur-
rent effort of science and handicraft that has been necessary to make this
possible. The average person seeing before him only his own telephone
instrument has but a faint conception of the miles of underground cables
and intricate switchboards that are required in order to connect his tele-
phone instrument with those of his friends or business associates. Though
the telephone instrument itself is but a small part of the telephone system,
still it is one of the most marvelous pieces of electrical apparatus that has
ever been produced. So sensitive is it that a current of one two-millionth
of an ampere has been known to produce audible speech. It is equally the
seivant of all, a polyglot, transmitting not only spoken words but the
accompanying accents and intonations of all languages.
For many centuries inventors have endeavored to add to the potenti-
ality of the voice by attempts to extend the range of utterance. The old
Grecian actors used masks and tubes in order that they might extend the
range of their voice. As early as the fifteenth century military engineers
warned themselves of the approach of an enemy by means of rods buried in
the earth and to which were attached drums. The approach of cavalry or
infantry caused the earth, and therefore the drum, to vibrate, which was a
signal of the enemy's approach.
After the invention of the electric telegraph many inventors set to work
to reproduce speech electrically, but all their efforts ended in failure until
Alexander Graham Bell gave to the world the electric speaking telephone in
1876. Bell was the first to realize that the timbre of the voice and the vari-
ous overtones could be reproduced only by means of an undulatory current
of electricity. But the telephone instrument itself would be useless unless
it could be connected at will to the thousands of other telephones that make
up the exchange systems of today. It may therefore be instructive to look
into the manner in which the wires from one telephone are connected to
those of another.
In the earlier days of the telephone all of the wires from the hundreds
of telephones were carried to the central exchange on pole lines, but as the
telephone business grew it became obvious that it was necessary to elimi-
nate these open wires and place them in some form of a cable. It was found
that the ordinary telegraph cables then in use were entirely unsuited for use
in the transmission of telephone currents. This was because the insulation
possessed a high specific inductive capacity, and because the wires instead
of being laid up in pairs, were 'straightaway." The telephone current is
a rapidly alternating one, and the effect of distributed capacity along the
transmission line is to distort and cut down the waves of current.
The final solution of the cable problem was the invention of the dry
core, paper insulated and lead covered cable. In this cable each wire is
insulated with a spiral wrapping of paper and is also spirally twisted about
its mate to prevent "crosstalk" between the different pairs. Over the entire
bunch of wires is drawn a continuous lead sheath which entirely prevents


the entrance of moisture. This style of cable possesses a very low electro-
static capacity which makes it admirably suited for the transmission of
telephone currents without distortion or attenuation. Formerly cables of
50 and ioo pairs were considered large, but today, by means of improved
machinery and improved methods of installation, we are able to use cables
containing four to eight hundred pairs of wires.
It was thought for a great many years that the placing of wires under-
ground was not feasible, and it remained for Mr. Barrett, the City Elec-
trician of Chicago, to demonstrate the feasibility of the plan by placing
underground the wires of the fire alarm service. Today there are thousands
of miles of underground conduits and cables in the large cities of the United
States, and the entire feasibility of the plan has been thoroughly demon-
strated.
At the telephone central station the underground cables emerge from
their lead sheaths and are connected to a large iron rack known as a distrib-
uting frame. At the terminals of the line from the telephone instrument are
placed lightning arrestors and a cut-out known as a "sneak coil." It has
been found that a current will damage telephone apparatus and will still not
operate a one ampere fuse in the circuit. These sneak coils have within
them a coil of fine German silver wire which, when a current of a half
ampere passes, produces sufficient heat to melt a small plug of fusible metal
and thus opens the line.
It has been found, by averaging up all the lines in the United States,
that the average telephone line contains about four miles of wire, so, when
two telephones are connected the average distance between them is approxi-
mately four miles. It is plain from this statement what an enormous
amount of travel is saved by the use of the telephone, and it strongly
emphasizes the motto of the telephone companies, "Don't travel,, talk."
From the distributing frame the wires are connected to the switchboard,
upon which takes place the actual _ connecting of the lines. When the
receiver is removed from the hook it causes the lighting of a small incan-
descent lamp on the front of the switchboard corresponding to the calling
line. The operator, to answer this call, will insert a plug into the "answer-
ing jack," which is immediately adjacent to the incandescent lamp above
referred to. The act of the operator plugging into the line also automati-
cally puts out the lamp. In order to ascertain the number wanted the oper-
ator depresses a small key which is connected to the pair of cords used for
making the connection. This key switches in the local operator's telephone
circuit and places her in direct communication with the calling subscriber.
Upon ascertaining the number wanted the operator will take the other plug
of the pair used and insert it in the "jack" of the line wished for. She will
now depress a ringing key on this same pair of cords, which sends a signal-
ling current over the line and rings the bell of the subscriber wanted.
When the conversation is finished and both subscribers hang up their receiv-
ers, two small "supervisory" lamps connected in the cord circuit are caused
to be lighted. These lamps lighting indicate that that pair of cords, and
consequently the connected lines, are no longer in use. The removal of the
plugs from the jacks automatically puts out these supervisory lamps.
In all large offices all of the entering lines are multiplied over and over
again, so that it is possible for any operator to connect into all lines at any
position of the switchboard. To prevent two or more operators plugging
into the same line at the same time it is protected by what is known as a
"busy test"; i. e., whenever a line is plugged at one section of the switch-
board, any other operator trying to make connection with the same line will
receive a warning click in her ear. In the modern switchboard all the
signalling apparatus and all the batteries are concentrated in the central

office. Usually one large set of storage batteries, consisting of eleven cells, is
used These batteries supply all the current used for signalling and trans-
mission in the entire exchange. The mechanical and electrical intricacy of
the modern telephone switchboard is almost beyond belief, except to one
who has had to deal with the thousands of circuit combinations and
mechanical details. One circuit that I recall to mind and which is used
between local and long distance switchboards requires the operation of 14
relays to make a complete cycle of connection and disconnection. A
complete description is impossible in an article of this kind.
No less wonderful than the switchboard is the network of long distance
lines, which enables speech to be transmitted from one section of the
country to another. To accomplish this it has been necesary to construct
substantial and heavy pole lines carrying a great many circuits of large hard
drawn copper wire. It has also been necessary to transpose all of these
wires most accurately so as to prevent one wire from producing crosstalk on
another, and to annul the effects of electro-static and electro-magnetic induc-
tion from adjacent lighting and power wires. Conversations between cities
west of the Mississippi and the New England cities are now of every day
occurrence. When one stops to consider the extreme minuteness of the
telephone current it is difficult to realize that it can be transmitted over a
line a thousand miles in length and still have sufficient strength to operate
the diaphragm of a receiver and reproduce speech. The recent inventions
of Dr. Pupin, who has shown us how to annul the distorting and attenu-
ating effects of distributed "line capacity" by means of distributed "self-
inductance," have made it possible to still further extend the range of tele-
phonic transmission, and we feel confident that transcontinental telephony
is a possibility of the near future.
All the vast volume of traffic which goes over the telephone lines passes
unnoticed by the public at large. In the street car systems and the great
railroad systems we constantly see evidences of the immense traffic handled
and we marvel at the system which enables these results to be produced;
but the telephone system does even a greater amount of traffic and does it
in a noiseless manner. And this telephone traffic is daily assuming greater
and greater proportions and is entering into every branch of business and
social life. At a recent meeting of the American Institute of Electrical
Engineers, President Scott referred to the telephone as the high speed tool
of the twentieth century.
The telephone business is growing so rapidly that even telephone engi-
neers are amazed and wonder what is in store for the future. Only five
years ago the engineers of the New York Telephone Company made a study
of the probable telephonic growth in the next twenty years and decided that
the number of telephones on Manhattan Island in 1920 would be 100,000.
The year of 1903 has hardly begun but the 100,000 mark in New York was
reached several months ago. Needless to say, the plans have long since
been revised and the figures raised to 300,000.
Pittsburg has today nearly 25,000 telephones, and we confidently expect
to see this number doubled in the next five years. The number of toll
messages from Pittsburg to outside cities now number 5,000 daily and this
number is so rapidly increasing that it almost forces the conclusion that the
business man hesitates to write a letter or even a telegram when it is pos-
sible for him to talk and get an answer instantaneously.
While the telephone business has been developing for the past quarter of
a century it is only in the last decade that it has sprung rapidly to the front.
During the past ten years the system of telephonic communication has been
entirely revolutionized, the old magneto system giving way to the modern
common battery switchboard, which switchboard is the result of the concen-


trated efforts of engineers, skilled not only in practice, but in the theory of
electricity as well.
It is significant that the modern common battery telephone system
appeared upon the scene only after the advtnt into the telephone business of
the technically educated engineer, the "college graduate." Ten years ago the
technical telephone engineer was not considered necessary and in fact, when
he did enter the field, was looked upon as a dreamer full of theories but
lacking in practice. But, from the work of these pioneer engineers, the
financial men at the head of the various telephone companies soon realized
the results that could be obtained from a properly organized engineering
force, and today all telephone work of any importance is first planned by the
engineers.
Many engineers have looked upon telephone engineering as trivial and
as an unimportant branch of the engineering profession. Mr. Gherardi,
Chief Engineer of the New York and New Jersey Telephone Company, said
some weeks ago before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, that
he believed a telephone engineer had to be more kinds of an engineer than
was required in most any other branch of the engineering profession, for, in
addition to his knowledge of telephone engineering he must understand elec-
tric power and lighting so as to protect his own circuits; he must be familiar
with mechanical and electrical engineering to plan the great variety of
apparatus required for the modern central office switchboard and power
plant, and he must be a good civil engineer to properly lay out the required
aerial and underground systems of wire distribution. It is true that the
currents usually handled by telephone engineers are very small, but they
must be measured all the more carefully because of their smallness and the
effects of ohmic resistance, self-induction and static capacity most carefully
considered.
It has been proved on the great railroad systems that the best executive
men were those who had come up through the engineering department.
The executive officials of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, undoubtedly
the greatest railroad system in the world, are nearly all engineers, and the
rules of the company now require that all executive positions be filled from
the ranks of the engineers. The same thing is now taking place amongst
the telephone companies and a number of men are now filling executive
positions, who, a few years ago, were students in engineering schools.
Telephone engineering has been so little heralded, has had such a small
place in the average college curriculum, and has therefore seemed so unat-
tractive to the young engineer, that I hope I will be pardoned for making
this plea in its behalf and for calling attention to a few of the results
accomplished by the telephone engineer.


SOME RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CIVIL ENGINEER.
CLARENCE T. JOHNSTON, 95, ASSISTANT CHIEF, IRRIGATION INVESTIGATIONS,
U. S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.
The engineer has made possible the rapid industrial growth of the
United States during the past ten years. There has not been a branch of
commerce which has not depended upon his services at some critical time
in its organization or development. His field of usefulness has been broad
because he has specialized. Where fifty years ago one man would have
attempted to have covered the entire ground it is now essential that many
specialists, each an expert in his own line, be called into service. In civil
engineering alone we have the railroad engineer, the land surveyor, the
bridge engineer, the street paving expert, the specialist on water works and
sewage disposal, the mining engineer, the irrigation engineer and many
others. Each has his own particular fields of usefulness and each has
distinct duties to perform regardless of the fact that the foundation upon
which the experience of all is based might have been obtained through a
very similar university training. The specialist in engineering work, there-
fore, develops after the graduate has received his sheepskin, when actual
contact with the problems of the day plays an important part in influencing
him to follow a particular line of activity.
The wider my acquaintance grows among engineers who have received
practically the same training as did the boys of 95 and observe how they
have progressed in their own field, although it be limited, the more am I
impressed with the necessity of engineers fitting themselves for one par-
ticular branch of the service and becoming an authority in that. It is not
only in engineering knowledge that these specialists excel in their chosen
occupation but in many of the legal and economic questions which arise
they become authorities among engineers and their advice is often sought
by lawyers and judges.
As an example of what engineers are doing in the western irrigated
states I will briefly set forth some of the problems which have been solved
where engineers have been given an opportunity to carry out their ideas of
reform but which still remain in an unsettled state in most localities. The
government has always encouraged the home-maker and we have on our
statute books provisions under which land can be easily acquired. It was,
therefore, a simple matter for the early settler to establish himself along any
of our western streams and if irrigation was essential for the growth of
crops it was generally a simple matter to divert and use water. The
authorities at Washington failed to see that in a country where nothing can
be grown without irrigation, water and not land is the more valuable. Land
that can be irrigated is generally worth from fifty to five hundred dollars
per acre while adjoining unirrigated land can usually be bought for $1.25 per
acre. The difference in the value is wholly due to the advantages one tract
has over the other in irrigation. The government has never attempted to
exercise jurisdiction over the water of the streams of the west unless the
navigation interests thereon were of some importance. As settlement along
our valleys has increased, the water supply of many of the streams has
become exhausted, and to avoid personal conflicts between the users court
decrees have generally been depended upon for the settlement of disputes


as to who should be entitled to the supply during seasons of scarcity. Often
the feeling between neighboring irrigators runs high before courts are
appealed to, and this alone is a serious impediment to the rapid growth of
any community. Court decisions, however, only afford temporary relief,
and the neighborhood strife generally appears at a later date in an aggra-
vated form. In nearly all cases of this kind the engineering facts which
should be included in the testimony are either not brought in or they are
presented by authorities who are biased in their opinions. Land can be
parceled out to a number of claimants without affecting adjoining owners.
This is not true in the settlement of controversies over water. One
decision affecting two users is a matter of public concern. The courts have,
as a rule, not realized this and as a result one case has simply been the fore-
runner of another. The entire community depending upon a stream for
water for the irrigation of the lands along it should be represented when
any kind of an adjudication of the rights is undertaken. A stream of water,
like a highway, should belong to the public, and whenever disputes arise as
to the diversion or division of water the public interests therein should be
guarded.
The engineer first saw the necessity for observing these principles. The
credit for establishing a system of laws whereby rights to use water may
be settled cheaply and definitely without litigation, and protection thereafter
afforded the appropriator, must be given to him and not to the lawyer.
The lawyer profited through the endless litigation that poor laws afforded
him. The engineer who surveyed the ditches and canals, laid out the
fields and measured the water, first realized the injustice which was being
done the irrigator. The money from the farm went each year to swell the
bank accounts of lawyers who lived in luxury in the neighboring towns and
villages. Reform laws were not passed without arousing the opposition of
this class, while the public spirited members of the legal fraternity have
always extended their aid when such measures were under consideration.
Notwithstanding the need of a prompt and lasting settlement of water right
controversies, conditions have only begun to change recently for the better.
Only two states, Nebraska and Wyoming, have taken the settlement of the
rights to use water from the courts and put the control of the diversion and
division of water in the hands of a board of engineers whose duty it is to
measure the streams, determine the capacity of the canals and find the area
of the irrigated land under each ditch along the stream. Testimony is then
taken to determine when water was first used by each claimant, and fol-
lowing this a table is prepared showing the relative rights of the various
irrigators in accordance with the priority in time of use and the extent to
which water was beneficially applied. The board then issues certificates,
based on this table, which are recorded in the office of the county clerk as
are deeds for land. The water thereafter belongs to the land which is
described in the certificate. State authorities are thereafter responsible
that the water be distributed in accordance with the finding of the board.
Where such laws have fjone into effect litigation has been reduced to a
minimum and the ill-feeling between irrigators, so common before rights
were peaceably settled, has disappeared. Elsewhere the cost of litigation is
often equal to or in excess of the outlay required in the construction of the
irrigation works.
This much has been accomplished at the initiative of the engineer. An
example has been set which other states will not be slow to follow if no
counter-influence is brought to bear on the law-making bodies having these
matters under advisement. There are measures before the legislatures of
several western states this winter providing for the creation of the office of
state engineer and boards of adjudication. There is also an organized


effort being made to kill all such measures. This influence comes from
those who have private interests to further and their position is becoming
better understood as their campaign continues.
There is, therefore, a field for much special engineering talent in the
irrigated districts of the west. There is no place where it is more essential
for one to specialize to be successful. Irrigation engineering offers many
opportunities for those who may fit themselves for administrative positions
under state, county, irrigation district or under a single canal system. The
recent act of Congress extending aid in the irrigation development of th«
west will offerd employment to many who desire to undertake this kind of
work.
The "Men from Michigan" have already done something for the western
irrigator and there is still room for further work in the same field.


SCREWS.
A few Notes based on Practice and Experience.
EDWIN H. EHRMAN, '8
The purpose in writing this article is not to treat the subject as one
of the mechanical powers, nor to deal with it under the head of fastening
devices, but to make a few notes of a practical nature, relating to the
several standards, with the hope that they may be of service to those
engaged in machine design or shop management.
It is at the outset advisable to review the several forms of screw
threads in use, with some note and comment as to their fitness for the
various kinds of screws.

COMMENTS.
United States Standard Thread.
Of the styles of threads in common use in the United States, the
U. S. S. is the most feasible form to use in the manufacture of screws and
bolts. While the thread itself may be a trifle weaker than the sharp V
form, it gives a screw that for the same nominal size and pitch is much
stronger than a screw with the V form of thread, as the core diameter of
a screw with U. S. S. threads is greater by .43 of the pitch than that of
a screw with sharp V threads.
The increased danger of a screw with U. S. S. form of threads to fail,
due to the threads stripping, as compared with that of a screw with sharp
V threads, is more apparent than real, as experience has shown that a
screw will give way almost invariably by breaking across the diameter at
the bottom of the threads before the threads themselves will shear or strip.
The U. S. S. form of thread is admirably adapted to rough bolts and
studs, and many manufacturers are using it in lieu of the V thread. A
sharp V thread die has a tendency to tear the tops of the threads in thread-


ing rods or bars that are larger than the finished diameter of the screw,
and as bar iron varies considerably in diameter, and moreover is likely to
be slightly oversize, it has been the custom in cutting threads on it to use
dies that are 1/32 inch larger than the nominal size, so that the die will
not cut down the diameter of the bar, with the attendant liability of making
a poor thread as well as unnecessarily overworking the die.
Occasionally the writer has noticed that rough bolts and studs have
been threaded evensize when the diameter of the bolt was small enough
to admit of so doing.
This leads to confusion, especially in those sizes where more than one
standard of pitch is in use. For instance, in purchasing y2" machine bolts
one might get them with any one of five styles of threads, J4U oversize,
yi'™ evensize, y2" oversize, y2u evensize or y2a U. S. S. The adoption of
the U. S. S. form of thread would entirely obviate the present difficulty.
In the manufacture of nuts there is the same tendency in threading,
of the threads tearing if made perfectly sharp, and also a greater liability
of the tap breaking from overwork and clogging; consequently it has
become the custom to ream the nut blanks large enough to leave the thread
fiat, quite as much so as it is in the U. S. S. form.
A valuable point to the manufacturer, too, both in the making of nuts
and in the machine-shop, is the greater strength of taps having the U. S. S.
form of thread as compared with those having V threads, which means a
double economy, due to the longer life of the tap and the greater duty it
is capable of.
A good feature of the U. S. S. thread, and one that will bear extend-
ing, especially in the smaller sizes, is that it tends towards a finer pitch
than the V and the Whitworth standards, notably in the y2", i%", 2%",
2$4" and 5" sizes, and it might have been well when the system was
planned if the threads per inch for %" diameter had been made 22 instead
of 20; for 5/16" diameter, 20 instead of 18, and for i}£" diameter, 8 instead
of 7. At present some of our foremost manufacturers of machinery are
using %" and 5/16" screws with the finer threads above noted, styling
them U. S. F. (form) instead of U. S. S.
Sharp V Thread.
The sharp V thread will, however, long continue in general use, due
primarily to its simple form and secondarily to its having so thoroughly
established itself in mechanical industries.
It has another claim, however, and a very strong one, in that it is
admirably adapted to the making of steam-tight joints. Both in boiler
bolts, patch bolts and in iron pipes and fittings it answers the purpose
better than any other practical form of thread.
There is no variation at the top and bottom of the thread, as there
may be in both the U. S. S. and Whitworth forms of thread, with the
resulting liability of leakage through the clearance thus formed.
Whitworth Standard Thread.
The Whitworth form of thread has two points of merit that commend
it highly where heavy service is required. First, screws with this form
of threads have all the strength possessed by screws with the U. S. S.
threads, with the advantage over the latter of having no sharp edges or
corners from which fractures may start.
Second, screws and nuts with this form of thread will work well
together after continued heavy service where the other forms of thread
would fail. A good example is afforded by the adjustable jaw of a well


known make of pipe-wrench, the form of the threads of which have after
much annoyance been changed, with good results, to a thread of the Whit-
worth pattern.
Square Threads.
The square form of thread is usually made about twice as coarse in
pitch as the V or U. S. S. threads, and partly for this reason and partly
because the perpendicular walls of the thread do not allow the chips to
free, it is a troublesome thread to cut with taps and dies. There is also
difficulty where more than one cut is made to produce the finished screw,
due to the succeeding taps or dies not registering with the partially cut
thread (not "catching" the thread), and consequently partly or entirely
cutting away the thread already formed.
Acme Standard Thread.
The Acme screw thread was designed to overcome the objectionable
features of the square thread. It has many good points, not the least of
which is its strength and the ease with which it may be cut, compared with
the square thread. This is due to the greater strength of the teeth in both
taps and dies, as well as to the facility with which the cuttings free
themselves.
The angle of the sides of the thread 29° is that generally adapted for
worm threads. The angle of the thread
cutting tool may be easily laid off—if a
protractor is not available—as indicated
by the diagram. With a point B in the
line AB as a center and BC = % AB
as a radius, strike arcs so that tangents
may be drawn to them from the point
Fig. 1. A. The angle included by these tan-
gents will be 29°. This is based on the fact that
^=sini4#° = .2504,
which is correct within one half thousandth of an inch.
B. A. Standard Thread.
This is patterned after the Whitworth thread, though more acute and
shallow, and with larger rounds at top and bottom. The dimensions of
screws with the thread are given in m.m., the largest being 6 m/m diameter,
which is the smallest size of the International system. It corresponds to
our system of machine screw sizes smaller than %" in diameter.
S. I. Standard Thread.
The standard thread in the International System (Systetne Inter-
nationale), adopted by the International Congress for the unifying of
machine screw threads, held at Zurich, in October, 1898, resembles our
own U. S. S. thread. The formula; are the same, but the pitches are
somewhat finer than in the U. S. S. thread, a distinct advantage, especially
in the smaller sizes—from 6 m/m to 12 m/m in diameter.
To provide for a thread with a clearance at the bottom such as is in
general use in France, the Congress specified that "the clearance at the
bottom of thread shall not exceed 1/16 part of the height of the original
triangle. The shape of the bottom of the thread resulting from said clear-


ance is left to the manufacturers. However, the Congress recommends
rounded profile for said bottom."
By this wise provision choice is given manufacturers in the several
countries interested, to make the bottoms of their threads flat or rounded
as desired and yet have them conform to a common standard so as to
interchange, if necessary.
Pitches Finer than Standard.
Attention has been drawn to the matter of pitch in the foregoing para-
graphs in comparing the several systems of threads, and comment made
on the desirability of using finer threads.
The pitches of the U. S. S. thread are no doubt suited to bolts used
in the larger work in mechanical and civil engineering, but perhaps not
quite so well adapted to the screws used in smaller work—especially the
sizes of screws below one inch, and there has been a tendency among man-
ufacturers to use screws one, two and even four threads finer than stan-
dard. This leads to much annoyance and possibly to confusion, but it
suggested a scheme that the writer has adhered to for some years. The
plan has been that where a deviation from standard is deemed desirable,
the pitch used is one of a range of pitches, the units of which are suited to
the different materials and purposes. Out of this scheme intended to cover
the use of screws and nuts only, has developed the system of making all
special taps—even to 6" in diameter—with one of the following pitches:
A pitch of 8 threads is used for screw threads on large pieces and on
smaller work where the material is cast iron. A pitch of 12 threads is
used where a finer thread is needed and where the material, in part, is
brass. This pitch is that commonly used on boiler bolts, planer head bolts,
and to a large extent in the nuts fitting on milling machine cutter arbors.
A pitch of 16 threads is used where a still finer pitch is wished, and is
adapted to adjusting rings, collars and nuts on shafts and spindles used in
machinery,—especially on hollow spindles used on lathes, drill presses and
screw machinery.
Though in use but a few years, this scheme has been the means of
securing a uniformity of pitches in the special taps that are made from
time to time, and has proven invaluable.
Take, for instance, one item, the repair of tool posts and tool post
screws, where the constant wear and strain frequently results in the partial
stripping of the threads. It is quickly repaired by retappin? the hole 1/32"
larger with a tap of the same pitch as the thread in the tool post, and
putting in a screw to fit.
A tool post may be repaired in this way several times before the diameter
of the screw exceeds the width of the slot so much that it can no longer be
used. Suppose the size of the hole in the tool post be ji17, it may be
jnll q12 jqIS pit and 2I1S

replaced, whereas had it been repaired by using a i- tap and then a J6U tap
10
it would have been beyond repair after the second time. The coarser pitch
of the # " tap would also cut away a portion of the 12 pitch thread: and
thereby make a poor job.
Other pitches for smaller screws, each pitch covering several diam-
eters, have been established. This has been done largely to enable quick


repairs of special cutter heads and holders. The following list explains
itself, additional sizes of taps being added as occasion requires:

with isolated sizes of one or another of the above pitches up to I inch
and V/i, inches in diameter.
The foregoing scheme may be quite impracticable in some shops, but
on the other hand the carrying out of some systematic plan in establishing
special sizes of screw-threads would undoubtedly add to the economy of
the tool-room and machine shop.
The following list of taps, one made up from the stock of 12-thread
taps on hand, and the other from those of the other pitches within the
same range of sizes, will probably be more of an argument for the system
than all that precedes:

Metric Threads.
Before leaving the subject of pitches it may be of interest to call atten-
tion to the cutting on the lathe of metric pitches. The addition to the
change gears of a lathe of one with 127 teeth is all that is needed to intro-
duce one to the metric system. With the proper change gears on the stud
and lead screw for cutting 8 threads per inch, place the 127 and 40 teeth
gears on the stud for compounding, so that the gear on the spindle stud
drives the gear of 127 teeth and the gear of 40 teeth, on the stud with the
gear of 127 teeth, drives the gear on the lead screw . The introduction of
these two gears into the train has affected the combination as follows:
^ • 5' = ^ = -°3937" = 1 m/m.
127 8 127
By changing the ratios of any two gears (exclusive of the gear with 127
teeth) one may be able to cut threads of iJ4, V/i, iji, 2, 2^, 3 (and pos-
sibly more) millimeters pitch, and so be prepared for an emergency,—such
as the repair of a foreign built machine, perhaps a French automobile.
The Drafting Room.
Passing from the shop into the drafting room, one finds many ways and
means of making and keeping lists of the screws used in the shop for
special purposes.
In one office will be found large sheets of drawings of screws burdened
with network of dimensions and lines. In another a tabulated sheet is
used for each style of screw used; a drawing of the screw with lettered
dimensions above, and below it the table of dimensions with the proper
index letter at the top of each column. In still another office one may find
descriptive lists of the screws, bolts and nuts used in each machine or
article manufactured, perhaps with reference numbers indicating the num-
ber of the piece or drawing from which each item is taken. Perhaps in


61
another office one may see a general list of all screws supposed to be kept
on hand; and possibly—probably—some other office may keep no list at all.
Ofttime's, too, a board of mounted samples takes the place of drawing
or list.
Each system, no doubt, answers the requirements of the office using
it, otherwise it would be replaced by a better one; each has its good points,
too,—from the completeness of the first system to the simplicity of the last.
For special screws and formed pieces that are quite different from
stock goods, a drawing of each piece is probably the only way of fully
describing it, but for the average screw, resembling in some degree the

Fig. 2.

Fie. 3-
common stock patterns, the most compact method of record is by tab-
ulated dimensions, referring to a diagram of a typical screw of its class.
For stock goods a descriptive list or table answers the purpose as well as
the preceding systems.
As one purpose of these records is to facilitate the ordering of screws,
it follows that the specifications, drawings and descriptions should be
explicit and entirely free from ambiguities. Many curious screw sheets
and blue prints come under the writer's notice, and they lead one to think
that either too little thought or too much time and paper had been spent

in making them,—perhaps both,—and they prompt a few comments and
general suggestions.
In general,—
—Screws that enter a tapped hole have their lengths measured to the
extreme point. (See L, Fig. 2, and A, Fig. 4.)
—Screws that enter a nut (i. e., bolts and studs) have their lengths meas-
ured to end of the thread, leaving the oval additional. (See L, Figs. 3
and 4 and Fig. 5.)
—Measurements of length are made from the outer diameter of the
upnderside of head. (See L, Figs. 2 and 3.)
—The diameter of a square or hexagon head is understood to mean the
short diameter.
—The blank part of a screw body is understood to extend to the first

marks of the thread, and should measure in cap screws as shown in Fig. 2.
(See B in Figs. 2, 3 and 4.)
—The length of the thread is understood to apply to the useful part of
it. (See f and N, Figs. 2, 3 and 4.) (Note that the lengths N in Figs. 3
and 4 should not include the partly formed threads made by the leads of
the die, as a nut would bind if forced over them. This is true also of cap
screws, as shown in Fig. 2. The length of thread on the tap end of a stud,
however, includes the "lead" or partly formed thread, as the stud when
screwed tightlv into a tapped hole will enter it practically the whole length
of the thread. (See T, Fig. 4.)


And ordinarily,—
—The length of the blank (B, Fig. 2) part of the body of a cap screw
(except for very long screws) is % L.
—The length of thread (JV, Fig. 3) on coupling bolts is VA times the
thickness of the nut, where one nut only is used.
—The partially formed thread made by the leads of the die is, on most
screws, about 3 threads in length; on set screws and the tap ends of studs
about 2 threads in length.
—The angle A (Fig. 2) in cap and machine screws is 400.
—The angle A in boiler patch bolts is 45°.
—The short diameter of hexagon nuts, both finished and semi-finished,
and rough square nuts is equal to V/i B + H" where B = sire of bolt. This
is true also of coupling bolt heads (hexagon) which are not finished on
their sides.
(According to the Franklin Institute Standard the above would apply
only to unfinished heads and nuts. The diameter of finished heads and
nuts would be i&gt;£ B + fa ".)
—The regular thickness of finished and unfinished hexagon nuts and
unfinished square nuts is equal to the diameter of the bolt This is true
also of the heads of coupling bolts.
According to the P. I. Std, the above would be true only of unfinished
hexagon heads and nuts. The thickness of Finished Hexagon Nuts and
heads would be B — -fa. Square heads are not supposed to be finished and
their thickness is one-half the short diameter or % B + tV "•
The thickness of Check and Jamb nuts = }i B 4- A" (where B &lt; 1%
= % B+X" (where B =
or&gt;itf")
The diameter is the same as that of unfinished nuts.
—The length of head for milled screws equals the diameter of the screw.
The diameter of cap screw heads = B -\- constant (for a limited range
of sizes). E. G. The diameter of Hexagon Heads = B -\- -ff (where B &lt; %
= B + % (where B ranges from % " to 1% ").
—The dimensions of a screw should be expressed in terms of the diameter
X the length (diameter first).
The fact that the proportions of nuts and screw heads are governed
largely by formulae has led the writer to formulate rules that govern the
proportions of those parts of machinery in which screws and nuts are
used. Among the parts that may be standardized are: Finished washers
suited to (1) cap screws and to (2) nuts; bosses on castings for set screws,
lugs on castings suited to (1) round head screws to (2) square and hexagon
head screws and to (3) nuts (or bolts); thickness of collars of collar
screws; sizes of taper pins relative to the diameters of the shafts in which
they are used (in much the same way keys are proportioned), etc., etc
Diagrams standardizing parts and pieces such as those enumerated
save much time in the drafting room and relieve the draftsman of a large
part of the detail that otherwise must be worked out anew in each recur-
ring case.
Returning to the subject proper, it might be of profit to inquire into
the ways of expressing by drawing, diagram, or words the dimensions of
screws and bolts. It is quite a common practice to overload a sketch or


diagram with dimensions, and it is also of frequent occurrence that dimen-
sions are given that are complements of the ones intended. This may be
made clearer by an illustration or two.
A sketch such as Figs. 2 or 3, with the dimensions L and B, indicates
that the piece is wanted with the blank part of the body a specified length,
whereas this is.very unusual; and if the piece was made as called for the
useful part of the thread would probably be too short.' What is usually
intended to be expressed are the dimensions T and L or N and L.
A sketch such as Fig. 4, with the length expressed as shown at B,
leads to confusion, as it is impossible to leave so much blank as the dimen-
sion B calls for if the lengths of useful thread are as called for by the
dimensions T and N. Ordinarily what is desired is the length of thread
T and N as styown at A, which with the dimension L is enough. If the
blank part is to be a specified length, the dimensions should be written
as shown at C, stating also of course the length L.
At this point it might be well to state that a stud with one end cham-
pered is usually threaded large enough on that end to fit tightly in a tapped
hole; and if it is desired that both ends are to be threaded to fit nuts,
then both ends are made rounding and the lengths of thread for both
ends are expressed as shown at N. Other points are brought out by Fig. 5.
Though apparently very clear and exact, it does not mean just what it
states. In the first place, the dimension i%" should be explained by
words under it such as "short diam.," as the intention is no doubt that
the head is desired l%" hexagon, and not \%" across the corners. The
short diameter corresponding to the l%" long diameter is 31/32", which
would be rather out of proportion to the %" shoulder, although the same
diameter as a nut that would fit the threaded part. It is conventional to
show three faces of a hexagon head, as the other view showing but two
faces might be mistaken as showing a square head; while a square shown
by a view of one only might easily be taken to represent a round head.
The words "short diam." would remove all doubt, while the view shows
the style of head. In the second place the drawing shows the thread run-
ning abruptly into the shoulder, a practical impossibility, and the dimen-
sions would also lead one to think the nut should screw close to the
shoulder. While the thread can be cut with a die of extremely short lead
so that a nut could be screwed up to the shoulder, it would be difficult to
make a very satisfactory job of it. To avoid any ambiguity it would have
been better to have shown a neck in the screw under the shoulder, if the
nut is to screw direct against it, or a short blank left under the shoulder
if a washer is to be used under the nut.
Another matter not yet touched on, and one that pertains, or should
pertain, to all specifications for screws (or other turned machine parts) is
that of "fit." Some instruction such as tight, steam tight, loose, snug,
journal fit, tight wrench fit, finger fit, driving fit, etc., is necessary to make
a specification complete.
No two persons, of course, can or will interpret instructions such as
the above in the same way, but the personal element is not so uncertain
but that much good would result if the draftsman would give some atten-
tion to this matter in making up his sketches or lists. From trade
experience, and also from machine shop experience as well, it can be
said that by being explicit in stating how the several parts of a machine
(including screws and bolts) are to fit one another much trouble, time and
money can be and is saved; perhaps more than can be saved in other ways
requiring the same amount of thought and care.


Turning our attention again to Fig. 5, it is seen that, changed as sug-
gested, it clearly shows what is wanted, and, if put into words, the descrip-
tion would read—
Hex. Head Shoulder Screw:—
Head 1 % Hex. X tV nut finish on top.
Shoulder % X ji, journal fit in reamed hole.
• Body ft"' X H, oval additional, light wrench fit in C. H. nut. Necked
under shoulder.
Other ambiguous statements are often made in specifications, more
frequently in written descriptions, however, than in drawings. A little
thought used at the right time will enable one to avoid them in either case.
Attention is called to two common errors: (1) That of specifying "stan-
dard" without stating which standard, U. S. S. or V, is meant; and (2)
that of not properly stating the angle of the head of a screw, such as the
lower one in Fig. 2, or of the point of a conical pointed screw. To say
the angle is 300 or 40°, or 6o° is indefinite unless qualified so as to plainly
indicate whether the angle with the axis of the screw is meant, as shown
at A Fig. 2, or the included angle (=2^4). For instance, "300 Point" and
"60° Point" are usually taken to mean the same thing, although in inter-
preting these phrases one is assumed to mean the angle made by the sides
of the point with the axis and the other the angle included by the sides
of the point. Though 300 (included angle) and 6o° with the axis (or
1200 included angle) are both uncommon, nevertheless a mistake is pos-
sible in assuming to interpret them either way. •
Variations in Taps.
Another branch of the subject that would be a very interesting one to
look into—if space permitted—is that of the variations in the several makes
of taps of the same nominal size and pitch. The error in manufacture,
changes in hardening, and the allowances calculated to overcome both, all
contribute to such differences in the products of the many makes of taps
that one is at a loss to know if there is any standard. In fact, some manu-
facturers of machinery are careful enough to consider this element, and
to specify that the screws made for them shall "follow" "Blank Mfg. Co.'s"
taps, knowing that their taps do not agree with those of another manufac-
turer, and which, in order to secure uniformity of product, all screw man-
ufacturers have adopted as standard.
In closing this article, the writer desires to state that he much regrets
the blunt and abrupt manner in which the several topics have been pre-
sented, but even if in spite of this it has only in part served the purpose
it was planned to, it will not have been written in vain.


THE HIGH FREQUENCY TRANSFORMER.
B. F. BAIIEY, '98.
The fundamental principle upon which the operation of most high
frequency apparatus is based, is the fact that the discharge of a condenser
is usually oscillatory in character. In other words if a Leyden jar or
condenser is charged and then discharged through a piece of wire, the
current instead of flowing steadily in one direction until all the energy is
expended, oscillates rapidly back and forth a number of times. The case
is precisely analagous to that of a pendulum or of a spring suddenly
released from pressure.
Thus in Fig. 1 and 2 if we imagine a current flowing in the circuit of
1 and the pendulum in motion in 2 the analogy between the cases is very
striking. Thus the electro-motive force, driving the charge into the con-
denser (equal to Q -H c.) corresponds to the force pressing the pendulum to
one side (equal to Ks). The back force due to acceleration I ^~y» I takes
the place of the back E. M. F. due to the self induction of the circuit
(l £2 ) and the force due to friction f A"a V - K2 — \ that of the E. M.
F. due to resistance or \R I = R 2 I. Indeed the equations for the two
phenomena are identical and we can calculate the period of vibration of
one as easily as that of the other. The theory is too long to give here and
I shall merely give two results of it.
One is that the period of one complete double vibration of such a system
is given by T = 2 n y/(L c) (comparable with T — 2 w %/- in the case of
a pendulum) and the other is that in order to have any oscillation at all, it
is necessary that the resistance of the whole circuit be less than 2 %/—, just
as in the case of the pendulum no vibration will take place if the viscosity
of the medium in which it is placed is too great.
The arrangement of the apparatus may be made in various ways, but
the most usual set-up is as shown in Fig. 3. T, is an ordinary alternating
current transformer, changing a current of 50 volts and 120 complete cycles
per second into one of about 5,000 volts, and, of course, the same fre-
quency. This charges the condenser C with a quantity of electricity 240
times per second. In Fig. 4, let the sine curve represent the vibrations
of E.M.F. at the terminals of this first step up transformer. At the point
a, there is no E.M.F. applied to the condenser, and consequently no charge
in it. As the voltage increases along the curve a e, the charge in the
condenser also increases, and we finally come to a point b .where the
voltage is great enough so that the air gap g (Fig 3) breaks down, and
allows the condenser to discharge through the primary L of a second step
up transformer.
This circuit of the condenser, the spark gap and the primary of the
second step up transformer is like that of Fig. 1, except for the resistance

of the spark gap, and the discharge is consequently a high frequency
current. This current is represented by b, d, c, in which the length of the
oscillations is greatly exaggerated on account of the difficulty of drawing
them sufficiently close together. The number in one set is probably greater
than shown there. From the secondary of this transformer we can draw
a current like that in the primary, except that the voltage is increased
about 50 times and the current decreased in the same ratio. This gives
us in this particular machine a current of a frequency of 435,000 double
vibrations per second, a voltage at the highest point of 50 X 5000 X i-4i»
or about 350,000 volts and an average current of about half an ampere.
This is a far greater output than could be obtained from an ordinary
induction coil of the same size. The spark discharge produces a regular
roar so great in the volume of current.
The high frequency and high potential transformer is of exceedingly
curious and simple construction compared with the ordinary induction coil.
The primary consists of only four turns of heavy copper strap. This is
wound upon a wooden frame somewhat like a bird cage, only with fewer
bars. The secondary has only a single layer of 200 turns wound upon a
frame within the other one. Owing to the high frequency no iron core
is needed, indeed its presence would be a detriment. Only about 350 feet
of wire is used for the secondary in comparison with about 5 miles which
would be wound on an ordinary coil of like capacity. The whole is
immersed in oil to provide good insulation.
There is some liability of an ordinary alternating current arc forming
across the gap g and to prevent this a motor is used to rotate a toothed
disc to break the arc. An air blast is sometimes used for the same pur-
pose. The coil works nearly as well, however, with a plain spark gap.
Now considering only the condenser and primary of the high potential
transformer, we have a system exactly like that of Fig. 1. If the terminals
of the secondary of the high potential coil be so widely separated that
no current can leap the gap, this secondary will have very little effect on
the system. The secondary of the low potential transformer also has
little effect, as both its resistance and self inductance are so extremely high
compared with that of L, that practically all the condenser discharge takes
that path.
The whole consideration can then be reduced to that of Fig. 1, and
the frequency, etc., can be calculated on this assumption. The low poten-
tial transformer is merely a means of renewing the supply of electricity
in the condenser after each oscillation.
To go back to the pendulum again, this transformer takes the place
of the operator who must occasionally give a push to the pendulum in
order to keep up the motion. In other words, 240 times a second the
transformer gives the system an electrical blow and starts it vibrating.
We can now examine a little the results of our two equations. Taking
the one for the minimum value of the resistance R &lt; iy/~ of L and c
which are for this machine respectively 3.15 millionths of a henry and 4.25
hundredths of a micro-farad we reach the interesting conclusion that R is
less than 17.2 ohms. Thus the actual ohmic resistance of the spark gap is
certainly less than 17 ohms and is probably much smaller yet. To figure
the frequency is quite simple. We have merely to substitute the values of
the capacity and the self-induction in the equation T= 2 t y/(L c). These
substituted give T = of a second or we have 435,000 complete double
435000


vibrations per second. This enormous frequency is the distinguishing char-
acteristic of the current, and is the cause of many strange effects.
Perhaps the most curious of these are its physiological effects. If we
pass an ordinary alternating current through the human body, all the
average person can endure without excessive pain is about 0.015 of an
ampere. The resistance of the body from hand to hand between dry metal
electrodes is about 2,500 ohms. Then, since the power expended in the body
is given by PR we have .015* X 2500 = 0.56 of a watt. In other words, about
half a watt of power applied continuously in the form of an alternating
current or ordinary frequency is about all the human body can endure.
What do we find to be the case with the H.F. current? As far as I can
find nobody has ever constructed a machine large enough to give all the
current that could be endured, so what the limit may be we do not know.
The largest amount that anyone has used, so far as I can find out, is
1.5 ampere, which is the maximum amount Elihu Thompson could obtain
from his large machine. This means 1.5* X 2500= 5600 watts, or just
one thousand times the amount of power that can be endured when taken
in the form of a low frequency current.
Just what the voltage applied to the body was in this case, it is impos-
sible to say. At least it was equal to EX. I i? = 1.5 X 2500 = 3750 volts,
which would be its value if the body were non-inductive. But for such
enormous frequencies even the human body is decidedly inductive. Certain
experiments lead me to believe that the actual value was about 10,000 volts,
provided the frequency used in these experiments was about the same as
that with which I experimented.
This is certainly a very surprising result, but it is not the worst of the
case. By reference to Fig. 4 it will be seen that there is an interval from
b to c during which the current is flowing and another interval from c to b
during which there is no current. Now the 1.5 amperes is the average
(strictly speaking, the V(mean)' value, but practically the average) value
of the current during the whole time, and it is obvious that during the
time from b to c it must be much larger. Still more, if we take the maxi-
mum ordinate as at d, it will be very much greater than 1.5 amperes. Just
how much greater this is it is hard to say, but in any specific case we can
approximate it as to get at least an idea of the ratio. We will apply it to
the case of the machine considered in Fig. 3.
The current from any condenser delivering a sinusoidal current is given
by 2 w times the E. M. F. times the capacity times the frequency or I — 2 ir
A'. E. C. In one case, as we have shown, the frequency is 435000, the
E. M. F. is 5000 and the capacity as figured from the size of the condenser
in 4.25 X io-* farads. This gives /= 2 x X 435000 X 5000 X 4.25 X 10-8 =
583 amperes. This is an enormous value and is certainly far above the
average, as such a current would easily melt the converting wires. It is,
however, the average value of the first ordinate or d in Fig. 4. The actual
average value is probably not more than one-tenth of this value. This
leads us to the surprising conclusion that if the average value of the cur-
rent passing through the body is 1.5 amperes the average at the start of
each set oscillations is probably about ten times as large, or 15 amperes,
and the maximum at the start is 1.4 greater than this, or 21 amperes. This
would involve a rate of expenditure of energy of PR = 2l" X 2500= 1100
K.W., or over 1400 H.P.
In the same way if the average value of the B. M. F. is 10,000 volts
the maximum value would be about 1.4 X 10 X 10000 = 140,000 volts.
There are numberless theories regarding the harmlessness of these
currents, but nothing certain is known about it. The fact simply remains


that there is not time between the very rapid alternations for the muscles
to respond and produce the painful contraction which is characteristic of
the alternating current of low frequency. Also there is no electrolysis,
which is probably mainly responsible for the painful effects of the direct
current.
Another surprising property of these currents is the facility they give
for what might be called "wireless lighting." If a glass globe exhausted
to the proper degree (a common incandescent bulb will do, but a Geisler
tube is better) be held near the high frequency coil it will light up in
much the same manner as though the discharge from an induction coil or
static machine had been passed through the rarified gas. There need
be no connection whatever between the tube and the coil. This is easily
understood if we consider what would happen if we held a loop of wire
in the same position. Some of the lines of force from the transformer
would pass through the loop and by their rapid change of direction would
induce oscillating currents of the same frequency in the loop. Precisely
the same thing occurs when we hold a bulb of rarefied gas there. Oscil-
lating currents are induced in the gas in the same way, and it is these
currents that cause the gas to light up.
This is an illustration of electro-magnetic induction. The same result
can also be obtained by electro-static induction. If we connect the
two discharge rods to two metal plates, a and b, Fig. 5, we create between
them a rapidity alternating field of electro-static force. This is here
called electro-static by courtesy only, as it is far from static in fact.
If we now hold or suspend a glass globe rarified as before between them,
at one instant we shall have such a condition as shown in Fig. 5. One pUee
will be positive, the other negative and by the law of attraction, negative
electricity will be attracted to the left and positive to the right. An instant
later (in the case of the machine referred to = of a second later) the
v 870000'
conditions will be reversed and all the electricity attracted to the left of
the tube must rush over to the right and that on the right must all go
over to the left. This continues and thus sets up an oscillating current in
the rarified gas, which causes the tube to light up.
It has been suggested that this might be applied to commercial light-
ing by placing in or on the walls of a room large sheets of metal connected
to the terminals of a high frequency transformer. A lamp which would
consist merely of a globe containing rarefied gas and held in any suitable
manner could then be placed in any part of such a room and would light
up wherever placed. No wires of any sort would be needed. Of course
many objections to such a scheme are apparent, but the crowning one is
that any person living in such a room would have large currents induced
in their bodies. The currents would doubtless be injurious if applied con-
stantly. Besides such a system, as far as we can see at present, would
be very costly and inefficient.
As to the application of high frequency currents in practical engineer-
ing the outlook is not encouraging. There is no doubt but that such a
system could be made to work for lighting purposes (using the ordinary
incandescent lamps in the usual manner, and not as described above), but
several disadvantages would appear. The high frequency would make
trouble on acount of induction and capacity effects, and the regulation
would consequently be bad. The only saving would be in the cost of
transformers, which, as was said before, would need no iron and very few
turns of wire, and consequently could be built very cheaply. This is,


however, a comparatively small matter, and there is no likelihood of any
such application in the near future.
The most promising field appears to be in the line of medical work.
We can certainly apply an enormous amount of energy to the human body,
and this must have some effect. Ultra violet light can readily be produced
(and without any appreciable amount of accompanying heat) by these
currents, and is being quite extensively used in the treatment of certain
skin diseases, and apparently with very beneficial results. Apparently it is
along this line we must look for the most useful applications of the high
frequency currents.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC.
THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE STEAM TURBINE.
No distinctive type of prime mover, whether the development of a
new invention or the rehabilitation of an obsolete one, has within recent
years aroused more interest and curiosity among engineers and power
users than the Steam Turbine. It has been eulogized in glowing editorials

Kig. 3.—Pressure Velocity Curve from Nozzle.
and thrust before our fancy as the successor of the monster multiple
expansion steam engine for trans-oceanic service. It is advocated by
engineers, who recognize its merit as the future prime mover par excel-
lence for central station work by reason of its almost unique adaptability
to generator driving and the opportunity it offers of returning the con-
densed exhaust steam to the boilers without fear of deleterious effects from
oily impurities introduced in the feed water. Although much of this
eulogism of the Steam Turbine is based upon superficial knowledge of its
eccentricities, there is indisputable ground for anticipating for the near
future a rapid and extended introduction in many classes of power service.
In the light of comparison with its reciprocating rivals, the Steam Engine
and the Gas Engine, the Steam Turbine has indeed undergone remark-
able development. In less than two decades it has been rescued from the
oblivion of Archimedean antiquity and has already begun to replace the
Steam Engine in factory and power plants. It was stated some months
ago by Mr. Chas. Parsons, that the total output of turbines of English,
Swiss and American build sold and under contract for power and marine
work aggregates 385,000 H.P. As this figure does not include machines
of the Rateau, De Laval or the Curtis types, the magnitude of the steam
turbine industry is apparent. That it can scarcely fail to command an
undisputed field in the near future is evidenced by the results which have

the fact that American and European factories are turning out machines

normal capacity. It is interesting to note that the larger machines have
an over-load capacity of over iiooo E.H.P. maximum. Five machines of
this size are now building at Pittsburg, Pa., for a London railway system,
and several 5000 K.W. machines are building or on order at the works of
the General Electric Co. at Schenectady, New York. Without dealing
further with the commercial possibilities of the Steam Turbine, let us
consider briefly some of its salient features.
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES.
All prime movers operating upon the principle of the direct conversion
of the kinetic energy of a moving mass of fluid into useful work by impact
or reaction, or both, may be broadly classed as turbines, although strictly
speaking the classification is no more applicable to forms of steam than
hydraulic machinery. In many respects the two forms of motors are sim-
ilar in principle and action. In the Steam Turbine, however, two conver-
sions of energy take place, 1st, the conversion of thermal to kinetic, 2nd,
the conversion of kinetic energy into useful work. The secondary con-
version presents a direct parallel to the hydraulic turbine, but the primary
none. The action of the Steam Turbine is further quite distinct from that
of the reciprocating steam engine, in that this energy conversion is secured
in the engine through so-called static expansion, while in the turbine
through the force of impact and reaction of steam moving at high velocity.
A radical difference between the steam and the hydraulic motor, and one
that has introduced difficult problems in steam turbine construction, lies
in the low density of steam as compared with that of water and the varia-
tion between wide limits of its volume under varying conditions of pres-
sure and temperature. The volume of the water on the other hand remains
practically constant under the infinitesimal changes in temperature likely
to occur during its passage through the turbine due to superficial and
molecular friction.

dry saturated steam at 100 lbs. pressure gauge at a velocity of 100 ft. per

In order to obtain the same kinetic energy from the two fluids it would
be necessary for the steam to have a velocity of 1550 ft. per second.

The energy of steam in the form of a jet issued from a properly
designed orifice is shown in the form of curves in Fig. 1, calculated for a
De Laval Turbine for varying initial pressures up to iooo lbs. This energy
has been shown by Zeuner and others to be equivalent to that available
in steam expanding adiabatically in a piston engine under like conditions
of temperature and pressure. Velocity and jet energy for various values
of initial and final pressures are given in Table 1.
Although in many respects superior to the reciprocating' engine in
efficiency of energy conversion, the Steam Turbine has inherent losses,
some of which are traceable to the peculiar construction employed and
which have no parallel in the piston engine.

The Turbine losses may be summarized as:
Thermal:
a. Conduction.
b. Radiation,
c Leakage.
Thermodynamic:
d. Incomplete expansion.
e. Absence of adiabatic compression.
Mechanical:
f. Fluid friction.
g. Bearing friction.
Heat loss by conduction and radiation is of comparative unimportance
in the turbine, and may be largely reduced by insulating covering applied
to the exposed parts, as shown in view of 750 K.W. machine, where both
cylinders are completely lagged with non-conducting material.
Leakage is largely a question of mechanical clearances between sta-
tionary and moving parts, and is particularly active in the parallel flow

Fig. 13.—Governor and Relay Valve.
turbine, where it is overcome only by the highest grade of workmanship.
Incomplete expansion is entirely dependent upon the effectiveness of
the condensing apparatus, but may easily be reduced to zero by proper
design of the expansion chambers, if adequate machinery is available.
The reduction of the thermal efficiency of the turbine, due to the
absence of the adiabatic compression of the Carnot cycle, is from a prac-
tical standpoint irremediable. In order to secure this compression, auxil-
iary vapor compressors would be necessary, which would introduce a ques-
tionable net economy in addition to being a difficult and costly construction.
In this one respect the piston engine has decided theoretical advantage over
the turbine, although this advantage is greatly overbalanced by other and
vastly more important sources of economy inherent with the turbine.
Mechanical losses from fluid friction, while absolute losses in the case
of the hydraulic motor, are not so in the Steam Turbine, for the reason
that a portion of the heat generated by the friction of the working fluid
upon vanes and casing is returnable to the heat cycle as a superheating
effect, serving to defer to a certain degree the point of condensation, which
is inevitable with high expansion ratios. The extent of fluid friction is


altogether problematical, but it is observed that excessive moisture in the
steam due to priming of the boilers will check the speed of the turbine to
a noticeable degree. In the impulse type fluid friction is particularly active,
due to the enormous surface speed of the particles of moisture as they
traverse the bucket; also to the surface friction of the disc revolving in a
dense medium. The obvious remedy is high superheat and the best pos-
sible vacuum. In the parallel flow type the surface speeds are little over
1/10, but the small clearance necessary between blades and casings favors
the formation of a moisture film, which tends to introduce frictional losses
with wet steam. The same remedy applies to this type with equal force.
Mechanical losses other than fluid friction are confined mainly to the
bearings, which are of such construction that metallic contact between
parts is prevented by a capillary oil film. Bearing friction is thus
essentially fluid friction, and with a light oil it becomes one of the least
important sources of loss. This is well illustrated by the fact that the
rotor of a large parallel flow turbine will continue to revolve for 30 to 40
minutes after steam is shut off, also that the bearing shells, after several
years of continuous operation, show the original tool marks of the shop.
In the impulse type the mechanical friction is relatively larger, due to the
high speeds and the speed reducing gearing necessary.
While it is possible to determine accurately the extent of the frictional
losses in the hydraulic motor, no method of ascertaining the mechanical
efficiency of the turbine has yet been devised other than estimations from
no-load losses. In the case of a turbo-generating unit, the generators may
be disconnected and the friction water rate determined. The generator
may then be connected and the increased water rate measured. The differ-
ence is chargeable to generator friction and windage, which may then be inde-
pendently measured and the turbine friction calculated therefrom. For this
reason comparative figures of steam turbine performance must be expressed
in terms of recovered power, either Brake H.P., or, as in the case of
direct driven generators, by Electrical H.P.
A striking feature of the Steam Turbine is the absence of thermal
losses arising from the alternate contact of live and exhaust steam with
metallic surfaces, the temperature of which is an approximate mean be-
tween the two terminal temperatures of the working fluid. This loss is of
utmost importance in the reciprocating engine. It is usually greatest in
slide valve engines and least in engines having independent admission and
exhaust valves. In the latter the steam is admitted at one side of the
cylinder and discharged through the other side in order to isolate as far
as possible contiguous surfaces subjected to terminal temperatures, thus
approaching more nearly the ideal thermal efficiency of the Carnot cycle:
E = Tl~ZTl (absolute)
■M
The nearest approach to ideal conditions in the reciprocating engine is
secured in the employment of the Single Acting principle, admitting the
working fluid at one end of the cylinder and exhausting at the other
through outward stroke. This arrangement has been successfully used
in gas engines, and was employed by Prof. Thomson in a small experi-
mental engine of less than 10 H.P. capacity. By using steam at high
pressure with a moderate superheat and good vacuum he obtained an
economy of less than 20 lbs. of steam per horse power, which was
undoubtedly due to the maintenance of extreme terminal temperatures.
In the Steam Turbine an ideal condition exists: that of constant tempera-
tures throughout the machine. In every type, irrespective of mechanical
6


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC.
design, a definite temperature gradient exists along the metal of the sur-
rounding nozzle or casing. To this feature may be largely ascribed the
high economy of the Steam Turbine. A forcible demonstration of this is
afforded by machines of the parallel flow type under operation, in which it
is not unusual to find within a distance of three or four feet on the casing
a temperature range of 240 to 250 deg. F. with the exhaust parts sufficiently
cool to touch.
This point involves a second, and perhaps equally important one, con-
sidered from the standpoint of thermo-dynamic efficiency—that of expan-
sion ratio. With steam entering at 200 lbs. pressure and exhausting into
a 28" vacuum, which conditions are by no means uncommon in turbine
practice ,the theoretical ratio at full load is 1 to 165. In an ordinary com-
pound engine with cylinder ratio of 1 to 2, 150 lbs. steam and 26" vacuum,
the expansion ratio at economical cut-off such as J4 would be, roughly,
1 to 16 out of a possible 1 to 88. This feature is obtainable with small
increase in size or complexity, relatively to the piston engine in which the
frictional and condensation losses introduced with multiple cylinders would
tend to nullify the increase in economy to be derived from high expansion.

except under conditions of extreme initial pressure, such as occur in
marine service. The limitations of expansion in the turbine are deter-
mined entirely by the boiler and condenser. This point is clearly illus-
trated in Fig. 3, in which the pressure and velocity curve has been devel-
oped for a nozzle of elliptical section, the pressures ranging from 150 lbs.
gauge to 26" vacuum and the velocities from zero to 3810 ft. per second.
The thermal efficiency of the turbine may be estimated by the rational
method of reducing all quantities to a heat basis, thus:

of steam per B.H.P. under the conditions specified. In the case of jet
turbines the energy imparted to the wheel by the jet may be calculated,
and the difference between this value and the recovered work represents
the summation of turbine losses. These have been calculated by Mr. Cole-
man from the results of tests upon a 300 H.P. De Laval turbine, appearing
in Table 6. At full load:

CONSTRUCTION.
From a mechanical standpoint the different turbines may be divided
into three general classes, according to the method of extraction of energy
from the working fluid: ist, impact; 2nd, reaction; 3rd, impact and
reaction. The prototype of the present day turbines was distinctly a
reaction machine, similar in principle to the hydraulic "Barker's Mill." It
is interesting to note that a machine of this type, constructed of proper
proportions, is capable of yielding a very fair economy, and a test of a
S H.P. De Laval "centrifugal" is on record in which 40 lbs. of steam per
H.P. was realized. Practically the only application of the principle at the
present time is in the cream separator manufactured by the De Laval Sep-
arator Company, in which speeds of five to seven thousand revolutions per
minute are obtained from two reaction arms supplied with steam at the
proper pressure. The impact turbine originated with Branca and has
strictly no successor among present day turbines. The De Laval Turbine

is, however, usually considered as an impact turbine, although the reaction
principle is employed as well. The third type originated with the Parsons
Turbine, and now embraces two other machines, the Rateau and the Curtis.
Strictly speaking, therefore, all present day turbines belong to the third
class, which may be sub-divided thus: A.—Turbines consisting of a single
disc with one or more expansion nozzles. B.—Turbines having a series
of alternating moving and stationary vanes arranged either in radial or
parallel flow fashion with no expanding nozzle. C.—A combination of A
and B employing a series of discs together with expanding nozzles. Class
A is now represented by the De Laval; Class B by the Westinghouse and
Parsons, and Class C by the Rateau and Curtis. The essential difference
between the three main types may be briefly stated as follows:
In the De Laval the working steam is expanded within the nozzle
from initial pressure to atmosphere or vacuum, thus converting its poten-
tial in kinetic energy, which is surrendered to the wheel through impact
and reaction upon the buckets. In the Westinghouse-Parsons the steam
enters the turbine with low velocity, and by successive expansions through
the series of vanes and accompanying delivery of energy at each stage it
reaches condenser pressure at the end of the turbine after all the energy


81
has been taken out. In this machine, as well as in the De Laval, impact
and reaction takes place at each successive row of buckets with constantly
increasing velocity and decreasing pressure and temperature. In the Curtis
and Rateau types nozzles are employed in which a portion of the expan-
sion is carried out, while the remainder is accomplished within the vanes
themselves. In all five machines, therefore, it is possible to obtain the full
expansion from initial to final pressures determined by boiler and con-
denser, respectively. Considering each machine further in detail, we find
marked differences in construction and operation.
De Laval Turbine.—The most remarkable feature of this type of tur-
bine is the tremendous speed of the bucket wheel, necessitated by the
velocities attained by the working steam after expansion from boiler down
to condenser pressure in the properly designed nozzle. The principle of
operation follows in a general way that of hydraulics and the velocity cor-
responding to maximum efficiency is consequently one-half of that of the
issuing jet, which means that the buckets should revolve at a speed ranging

as high as 2000 ft. per second under conditions of high boiler pressure and
vacuum. The angularity at which each nozzle is placed modifies this speed
to some extent. Fig. 25 shows a standard nozzle mounting which is at
20 deg. to the plane of the bucket. This reduces the rim speed correspond-
ing to maximum efficiency to 46.98% of that of the issuing jet, or 1880
feet per second (4000/2 X cos 20°), or about 21 miles per minute. In
practice, however, this speed exceeds the limit determined by the strength
of materials, and in the actual machine the maximum peripheral speed
ranges from 34j4% of the jet velocity in the largest sizes to 13% in the
smallest.
The design of the nozzle for obtaining definite results may be accom-
plished with remarkable nicety. At the outset, however, a peculiar con-
dition is found to exist which places a definite limit to the capacity of a
nozzle with given throat area A and terminal pressures P' and P'. As long
as P" is greater than .58 P" the quantity discharged and the velocity of exit
is nearly proportional to the pressure head P1 — P", but beyond this limit
the quantity discharged and the velocity are constant irrespective of the
value of P. In order to increase the velocity it is necessary to provide a
divergent nozzle so proportioned that the steam will be gradually expanded

from P" to P" within the nozzle, thereby preventing the spreading of the
jet after leaving the nozzle, due to incomplete expansion therein. Fig. 3
shows the performance of a typical nozzle for condensing work. The
apparatus shown in Fig. 5 has been used with success for determining
experimentally the proper length and section for various nozzle capacities,

with results plotted in Figs. 6 and 7. In Fig. 6 will be noticed the partial
vacuum created by the nozzle, and in Fig. 7 the peculiar interference phe-
nomenon due to incorrect design of nozzle.
De Laval nozzles are designed either for condensing or non-condensing
work, and it is possible to so proportion them that the buckets may run
in a partial vacuum, as shown in Fig. 6, thus largely decreasing fluid fric-
tion. The high speed of the De Laval wheel has necessitated the mounting
of the wheel upon a long thin shaft in order to afford the necessary flex-
ibility. It being, of course, impossible to machine the disc with sufficient
accuracy to secure the coincidence of gravitational and geometric axes.
On this account as it increases in speed a point is reached where vibrations
which have started, suddenly disappear. This point is known as the
critical speed and marks the period when the wheel changes from one axis
to the other. The point may be calculated by the formula: N = C (P/Q) %.
Where P equals the force required to bend the shaft a certain distance,
G equals the weight of the turbine wheel, and Cis a constant. This critical
speed is found to be from 12^2 to 20% of the normal speed.
The typical wheel construction is shown in Figs. 8 and 9. Table 2 also
shows the diameters and speeds of the various sizes of wheels, the latter
ranging from 10 — 30000 revolutions per minute. It is difficult, however,
to appreciate the tremendous strain upon the material of the disc at this
speed. Fig. 14 shows a typical stress curve for a medium sized wheel.
Curve S represents the tangential and P the radial fibre stress at various
diameters. It will be noticed that the maximum fibre strain of 23000 lbs.
occurs at the bucket rim, and at this point the section is decreased slightly
so as to make sure that the weakest spot in the disc is at the rim, where
less damage could be done should failure occur on account of the small
amount of metal involved. It will be noticed that two types of shaft sus-
pension are employed; the lower for the larger and the upper for the
smaller wheel. The buckets are of drop forged steel with bulb ends assem-
bled upon the periphery of the disc with a drive fit. The escape of the
steam radially is prevented by the tops of the buckets meeting so as to


83
form a continuous rim enclosing the buckets. The hub of the wheel pro-
jects into the turbine casing in such a manner as to prevent the destruction
of the machine should the failure of the rim followed by the shaft take place.
The regulation of the De Laval Turbine is accomplished by a sensitive
centrifugal governor mounted at the end of the gear shaft and controlling a
double heat poppet valve in the steam line. This method of governing re-
sults in the throttling of the incoming steam at all loads below full loads, and
nullifies somewhat the advantage of high pressure steam. This can, however,
be remedied to a certain extent on uniform loads by reducing the number of

Fig. 26.—Side Elevation of 5000 K.W. Curtis Turbine.
nozzles in service to the smallest possible number, this permitting each nozzle
to work with steam at maximum initial pressure. This point is well brought
out in Table 5. Comparing tests 5, 12 and 17, which were conducted with
two, 3 and four nozzles, its action over the greatest possible range of load,
it appears that the steam consumption decreases 20 lbs. at approximately
the same load by keeping but two nozzles in action, working at full capac-
ity, rather than four at reduced capacity. This decrease in water rate was
accompanied by an increase of initial pressure at the nozzles of 65.1 lbs.,
or more than the original pressure with four nozzles.

The distinctive feature of this type is the means employed for obtain-

use of nozzles. The functions of the latter are embodied in a series of
rows of peripheral guide vanes alternating with a like number of rows of
moving vanes, as shown in the lower part of Fig. 24. Fig. 12 shows the
typical construction employed in the Westinghouse Turbine. The guide


85
vanes are mounted around the interior of the turbine casing, which is built
in halves separated along a horizontal plane to facilitate erection. The
rotor consists of a cylinder body of three steps mounted upon a rigid shaft
and carrying at one end numerous rows of pressure vanes, and at the other
three rotating balance pistons.
The balance pistons C, C, C are provided to neutralize the thrust of the
steam upon the vanes, and revolve freely within the casing. High pressure
steam enters through the annular orifice A at a velocity largely dependent
upon the load. It first encounters a row of stationary blades, which gives
the annular jet a definite direction similar to the nozzle in Fig. 24. The
steam then gives up a small portion of its energy to the first row of moving
blades by impact and reaction, and is redirected by the second row of guide
blades, this operation being extended to the end of the series, accompanied

by a definite increase in volume and velocity at each successive step. At
B and C the diameter of the annular jet increases to accommodate expan-
sion, while the depth of the jet increases uniformly from A to B, S to C
and C to B. This secures an equal coefficient of expansion for each row.
The vanes are of special hard drawn material, and range from Vi to 7
inches in radial length. They are calked in position by a special tool so
tightly that the elastic limit is exceeded before they may be extracted. In
practice the vanes are subjected to but 2.5% of this amount, and the dyna-
mic pressure each of the 31000 blades in a 300 K. W. Turbine exerted as
torque upon the shaft is but .89 to 1.04 ounces. The side clearance varies
from % to V*" and the end clearance 0.025" to .05", depending upon the

size of the machine. The balance pistons C and C" are brought into oper-
ation through ports (F) in the casing covers, and their diameter is accur-
ately gauged to equal the calculated diameters of the center of impact of
the moving steam jet. Leakage is prevented by interlocking grooves in the
periphery, which force the leakage steam through a tortuous passage. It
is thought that leakage is largely prevented by the centrifugal action
induced by the revolving disc tending to seal the leakage passages. The
casing is sealed at each end by frictionless ring glands fitting into grooves
in the shaft. When operating condensing they are air sealed by a small
amount of low pressure steam introduced at the center through ports in
the casing. The thrust bearing H serves to adjust the side clearances
between stationary and moving vanes.
A feature of the present construction is the method of securing flex-

ibility to the main journals T to accommodate the high speeds at which
the turbines run (3600 in the smallest size). For this purpose a nest of
concentric shells is used, each shell being isolated by a thin film of oil
under pressure from the oil reservoir supplied by the pump M. The oil
film exerts sufficient capillary repulsion to separate the metallic parts and
at the same time cushions the shaft vibrations when passing the "critical
speed." The journals are kept flooded, and no appreciable wear is there-
fore encountered.
The method of governing is an important feature of this type of tur-
bine. The worm R (Fig. 12) actuates directly the fly ball governor( Fig.
13), and a reciprocating rod C operating a train of mechanisms about the
fixed centers D and E. The main throttle valve is actuated by a relay
cylinder B, whose valve A is subjected to two movements, one a uniform
reciprocating motion from Cand the other a variable motion dependent upon
the load upon the machine. This apparatus admits steam to the turbine in


87
puffs of longer or shorter duration according to the load, but always at
full initial pressure, thus securing full expansion at all loads and avoiding
the wastes due to throttling. An indicator card taken from the steam
passage A (Fig. 12) would therefore present a series of connected dia-
grams resembling an engine card with exhaust and compression lines
removed. This governor may be replaced by an electrical governor, which
may then be compounded for maintaining constant E.M.F. at all loads, or
an E.M.F. increasing in proportion to the live losses.
In all machines a by-pass O is provided for increasing the capacity of
the turbine about 50%. This practically shunts the first expansion stage,
resulting in a slightly decreased economy, as is well shown in curve sheet
8, but which is somewhat recovered at higher loads. Fig. 16 is a view of a
750 K.W. tandem cylinder unit. This construction is employed to reduce
the bulk of the rotor and permit the introduction of intermediate bear-
ings between H.P. and L.P. cylinders. Figs. 1 and 18 are views of

the 1500 K. W. unit installed at Hartford, Conn. Fig. 19 shows the rotor
of this machine, and Figs. 20 and 21 the H.P. and L.P. rotor, respectively,
of a tandem cylinder machine. The machine work upon the rotating
masses is necessarily of the highest character, and before assembling each
section of the cylinder body is separately balanced upon a sensitive balance
capable of detecting an unbalancing of .002 per cent. After the calking of
the blades in both rotors and stator, the ends are accurately ground to true
cylindrical surfaces in order to preserve the proper clearances. In the
single cylinder machines the exhaust end of the turbine is cast integral
with the bed plate, but the steam end rests upon a planed base in order to
provide for linear expansion of the turbine casing when under steam. The
turbine is designed for either condensing or non-condensing service, prefer-
ably the former, but although the proportions of blades and expansion

chambers differ in the two designs, either machine will operate satisfac-
torily when running under vacuum or atmospheric pressure.
The Parsons Turbine embodies the same principle of operation as have
been noted in the American machine, but the two differ widely in details
of construction. The Parsons is being actively exploited abroad for
marine work, and notable results have been secured from The Turbinia
The Velox, The Viper and the Cobra. The Viper's record of 36.5 knots
still remains unchallenged.
THE CURTIS TURBINE.
Although comparatively little information is available at present upon
the internal construction of this turbine, some of its features have been
recently made public by Mr. W. L. R. Emmet, who has been connected
with its development. Fig. 24 indicates the principle of operation. Steam
enters the turbine through a multiple disc poppet valve controlling a cor-

Curve Sheet 4.—Initial Pressure—Economy.
responding number of compartments of a multiple nozzle. The steam
expands in this nozzle through a definite range, and its expansion is com-
pleted in a series of moving and stationary blades forming the parallel flow
section of the turbine. The first expansion stage corresponds to the prin-
ciple employed in the De Laval Turbine, and the latter stage to that of the
Westinghouse-Parsons Turbine. The object of introducing the parallel flow
principle is essentially that of speed reduction, for the reason that the
velocities of the steam jets issuing from the nozzles having performed but
a portion of their ultimate expansion are relatively low as compared with
velocities attained if the complete expansion were carried out within the
nozzle. The standard speeds of Curtis Turbines vary from 1800 to 50c
revolutions per minute in machines of 500 to 5000 K. W. capacity,
respectively.


89
The method of governing is a special feature of the turbine, and is
accomplished by means of the multiple ported admission valve, shown in
Fig. 24. At light loads but one or two sections of the nozzle remain in
service, at heavy loads the entire nozzle is thrown into service by the auto-
matic governor. In this manner the steam is used in a more efficient man-
ner, and if the entire nozzle had been in use at all loads and the steam
supply throttled according to the load upon the machine. It is stated that
this process of expansion in nozzle and vanes may be repeated in one or
more succeeding stages in a manner somewhat similar to that employed
in the Westinghouse-Parsons type. The nozzles of each stage may then
either be placed under the control of the automatic governor, or the auto-
matic feature upon the lower stage may be dispensed with and constant
adjustment of nozzle employed as determined by comparative tests.
The general design of the machine is shown in Fig. 26, which
are the plan and elevation of a 5000 K. W. Unit. The turbine is mounted

horizontally upon the top of a surface condensor, and in turn supports the
vertical revolving field type generator. The direction of steam flow is from
top to bottom, and three nozzles are employed, each supplied with high
pressure steam from a circular main surrounding the machine. The ver-
tical thrust of the shaft due to the weight of the generator and to the
resultant downward thrust from the steam jets is taken up by an interior
step bearing, not shown. The employment of this vertical type generator
and the location of a condenser directly beneath the turbine contributes
largely to the economy of floor space taken up by the turbine unit and its
accessories.
THE RATEAU TURBINE.
Although operating upon the same general principle as the Curtis, the
Rateau Turbine employs a slightly different arrangement of nozzles and
discs. Referring to Fig. 27, the sectional view of the two stage marine


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC.
turbine is shown, together with transverse sections, through the first nozzle
disc of each stage. In this turbine each vane wheel revolves in a separate
compartment, and is separated from adjacent wheels by a nozzle disc
accurately fitting the turbine casing, but loosely fitting the turbine shaft.
The machine thus constitutes in effect a series of De Laval Turbine wheels
mounted upon a single shaft, but differing from the De Laval construction
in that the nozzle is subdivided into a number of sections corresponding
to the number of vane wheels. The high pressure steam enters at A, and
by means of a circular steam port is admitted to four peripheral nozzles
01, 02, etc., each nozzle occupying but a small portion of the periphery and
being subdivided into several compartments, as in the case of the Curtis
nozzle (Fig. 24). The segmental area of each of the four nozzles grad-
ually increases from the steam to the exhaust end of the machine, in order

Curve Sheet 6.—Economy. 600 K.W. Curtis.
to accommodate expansion of the steam. This is shown in the right hand
transverse section taken in the plane X" X", in which the nozzle area is
shown to be approximately twice that of the initial nozzle area ol and 02.
In the marine type, in order to balance the thrust due to the propeller,
the last two diaphragms of the two stages are omitted, thus giving a result-
ant thrust to the right. An auxiliary vane wheel n, supplied by independ*
ent high pressure steam jets N, N, N, N, is also employed for reversing
the turbine.
A noteworthy feature of the Rateau construction consists in the
design of the vane wheel. The vanes are of forged steel and riveted to
the rim of the pressed steel disc, which is in turn riveted to a forged hub
keyed to the shaft. The discs are dished and flanged by a hydraulic press,
and present a remarkably light construction suitable for the comparatively
low speeds at which the Rateau Turbine runs, their speeds being about
1500 revolutions per minute for a 1200 H.P. machine. The Rateau Tur-
bine is at present constructed by Messrs. Sautter, Harle &amp; Co., of Paris,
and by the Macchinenfabrik Oerlikon of Switzerland, and is being devel-

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC.
The turbine tested was a tandem cylinder machine expanding to a
little above atmosphere in the first cylinder and to condenser pressure in
the second. As the superheat varied during the tests, all results were
calculated upon a basis of average superheat 14.30 C, using for this pur-
pose data obtained from previous trials, viz., 55° C superheat is equivalent
to 12% increas in economy. These tests also showed that 1" of vacuum
is equivalent to an iincrease of 4% economy. D, Sheet 3.
The upper economy curve shows the effect of opening the by-pass
valve. It is also apparent that the Willans line is a straight line for the
Steam Turbine. This fact also is brought out in the tests upon a Curtis,
De Laval and Parsons machines. A further important point is the main-
tenance of high economy throughout a wide range of load. In this respect
the turbine outclasses all of the forms of prime movers, with the result
that "all day" economy to be derived from a turbine driven plant is much
greater than would be obtainable with steam engines or other motors.

EDITORIALS.
The frontispiece shows the new Engineering Building under construc-
tion. It will be four stories high, with 92,600 square feet of floor room and
a volume of 1,442,000 cubic feet. The cost of the building without heat,
light, plumbing or ventilation will be $150,000. The total cost, including the
equipment for the laboratories, will be $250,000. It is expected that the
building will be finished by the fall of 1904. The old Engineering Building
will be used for mathematical and language work. The necessity for the
new building is apparent, as in three years the number in the Freshman
class has doubled, being 134 in 1899 and 268 in 1903. There are 609 students
this year in the Engineering Department, and if the present rate of increase
continues, we shall be cramped for room before the new building is finished.
The name of this paper has been changed from The Technic to
The Michigan Technic, with a view of associating the locality in which
the paper is published with the name of the paper. We feel that this change
will meet with the approval of all, as it has with those with whom we
consulted about the matter. The suggestion was made by Mr. George H.
Gibson, of the B. F. Sturdevant Co., and adopted by the present Board
of Editors.
The illustrations in the article on "The Present Status of the Steam
Turbine," by Mr. J. R. Bibbins, were not all printed, owing to delay in
their arrival.
Three contributions to The Michigan Technic have not been printed
this year owing to lack of space. We are much indebted to the authors,
Messrs. Alfred White, J. C. Thorpe, and Howard Coffin, and regret being
unable to publish their excellent articles, which we expect to print in the
1904 Michigan Technic.
We wish to thank those who have contributed to the success of The
Michigan Technic for 1903 by writing articles and also, last, but not least,
those whose advertisements have furnished the necessary financial assistance.

MEMORIAL EXERCISES
On the evening of Friday, Oct. 16, 1903, in addressing the opening
meeting of the Engineering Society, Professor Davis spoke of Professor
Greene's illness, and said that he could give no hope of his ultimate
recovery. The words were a shock to all those present, for while they
knew he was very ill, as he had been unable to take charge of his regular
work, still, he had not been closely confined at home, and no one realized
it was so serious. The next day they were even more greatly shocked to
learn that even as these words were being spoken, Professor Greene was
dying.
A mass meeting was hastily called by the President of the Senior
Engineering Class, and committees appointed to formulate resolutions and
to prepare a floral tribute. At a second mass meeting on Monday morning,
the reports of these committees were received and the resolutions adopted.
Professor Davis addressed the meeting with a few simple words, and at
his suggestion steps were taken for memorial services to be held in Uni-
versity Hall, and also toward the appointment of a committee to act with
the Faculty and alumni in the preparation of a suitable permanent
memorial.
On Tuesday, Oct. 20, at 4 p. m., the whole Engineering Department
met at the Engineering Building and marched to University Hall. A
hymn by a student quartette, prayer by Rev. Dr. Young, a short sketch
of Professor Greene's life read by Professor Davis, and a benediction
formed the simple services. After the meeting many passed to the house
where the body lay and viewed the remains.

CHARLES EZRA GREENE
H. B. MERRICK, '98.
Whenever in His infinite wisdom the Creator of the universe calls
to his reward one whose life stands out in bold relief from those of his
fellowmen, those who are left must feel the sense of loss most keenly.
At the beginning of the present school year he, who has served as
Dean of our Department of Engineering since its organization, laid down
the work he had carried so long and so well, and answered the summons
which must come to each one of us. His was a life so pure, so high in
ideal, and so great in achievement, that we can but mourn his loss from
amongst us.
Charles Ezra Greene was born in Cambridge, Mass., February 12,
1842, and died in Ann Arbor, Mich., October 16, 1903. His father was
a descendant of Rev. James D. Greene, of Charleston, freeman of 1647.
His mother, Sarah A. Greene, was the daughter of Daniel M. Durell, a
lawyer, member of Congress, Chief Justice of the Circuit Court, and
United States District Attorney of New Hampshire.
Spending his boyhood days, as he did, in the shadow of Harvard
University, it was but natural that his college days should be passed at
that institution. Here, in 1862, was conferred upon him the degree of
Bachelor of Arts, and, in 1865, that of Master of Arts.
From the time of his graduation until early in 1864 he was engaged
in the manufacture of breech-loading rifles. This business was then given
up to enter the service of the United States government as a volunteer.
After serving some months as Quartermaster's Clerk he was, in
January, 1865, commissioned First Lieutenant in the 7th Regiment of
United States colored troops, stationed before Richmond, Virginia, and was
appointed regimental quartermaster.
In August, 1866, he resigned his commission and that fall entered the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology to pursue the study of civil engi-
neering. In 1868 he completed the course there and was at once given
a position as Assistant Engineer on the Bangor &amp; Piscataquis railroad in
Maine.
After the completion of this road he was employed under Gen. George
Thorn, on the United States river and harbor improvements in Maine and
New Hampshire. He gave up this work to go to Bangor as City Engi-
neer. While here he received a call to the chair of civil engineering in the
Washington University at St. Louis, Mo. This he declined, but, in the
fall of 1872, accepted a similar call to the University of Michigan.


His predecessors in this position were Dr. Alexander Winchell, who
organized the department in 1853, and who was but temporarily in charge;
Professor William Peck, who resigned at the end of two years; and Pro-
fessor De Volson Wood. Professor Wood had for fifteen years directed
the affairs of the department, and had thoroughly organized and system-
atized the work.
Professor Greene assumed his duties without previous experience as
a teacher; but being thoroughly prepared by a splendid liberal education,
a special training for his profession and considerable practical experience,
he was able to carry them on in a most successful manner. He was also
possessed of other qualifications,—qualifications not to be acquired by the
study of books—by which he was peculiarly adapted to the work at hand.
To quote from an article by Dr. Henry S. Frieze, which was printed in
the Tech nic for 1888: "He possessed certain traits of character, without
which no amount of knowledge and experience can make an instructor of
the highest order; quiet self possession that suggests reserve force and
gives perfect control of others; enthusiasm in his work inspired by faith-
fulness; clearness of apprehension with a clear and clean-cut style of
statement; and finally, what is not less essential, a hearty interest in the
progress and welfare of his students."
Under his able management, aided by his associates in the work, the
Department of Engineering grew and expanded until today it is second to
none in the thoroughness of its work. At the present time the depart-
ment, largely through his influence, and as a result of his untiring energy,
offers courses in five branches of engineering. From the one branch,
Civil Engineering, have sprung those of Mining, Mechanical, Electrical,
Marine and Chemical Engineering. The work in Mining Engineering was
some years ago transferred to the Houghton School of Mines.
In 1895 the connection of the Department of Engineering with that
of Literary, Science and the Arts was severed by the Regents. Professor
Greene was then appointed Dean of his department and held this position
until the close of his life.
Although so large a portion of his time was devoted to his work in
the University, outside affairs claimed a share of his efforts. In 1880 he
was Chief Engineer of the Toledo. Ann Arbor &amp; Northern railroad. The
timber trestle bridge over the Huron river at Ann Arbor was designed
and built by him. This structure was replaced some years ago by one of
steel.
In 1882 he was Superintending and then Consulting Engineer of the
Wheeling &amp; Lake Erie railroad bridge across the Maumee river at Toledo,
O. The following year he held the position of Consulting Engineer of
the Cherry Street bridge in the same city. The figuring of the stresses
in the different members of this bridge was an exercise given in his class
room for a number of years.


The engineering plans for the water works of Ann Arbor were fur-
nished by him.
He is well and widely known as an author of text-books on engineer-
ing subjects. In less than six months after taking up his duties in the
University his first volume was published.
It is not generally known that upon the occasion of his graduation
from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology his thesis was rejected
by the faculty of that institution. The small volume on Roof Trusses,
above spoken of, is that thesis somewhat revised and enlarged.
It is only since that time that the graphical solution of problems of
engineering has come into general use. Its trustworthiness was demon-
strated experimentally in the following instance: When the two ends
of the arch which spans the mighty waters of Niagara had almost met,
there was inserted between the ends of the meeting ribs a mechanical con-
trivance for measuring the stresses there. The results obtained were in
full accord with those found by the method given in Greene's Arches.
His labors as an author were continued until the publication of Structural
Mechanics in 1897.
In Professor Greene's class room young men learned things not printed
in books. They were taught to use their reason and their judgment rather
than their memory. Nothing pleased him better than to take up a new
subject and by suggestion and well directed inquiry, lead the student to
formulate statements of which he had not believed himself capable.
At times, invariably for the students' good, he was exacting. He was
never harsh. On one occasion when the papers on an examination in
Theory of Construction were uniformly poor, he passed the entire class
and at the next meeting made them a most humble apology for having
failed to make the subject clear to them. This in a tone of real sorrow
which did much to inspire the members of that class to greater effort.
No one could sit in Professor Greene's classes and fail to be impressed
by his complete mastery of the English language. In explaining a prob-
lem he was able to give his whole thought to the problem, the words of
his sentences seeming to arrange themselves in such order as to leave no
doubt as to their purport. And this without apparent effort on his part.
As an instance of this, Professor J. B. Davis told me of a talk which Pro-
fessor Greene gave before the Michigan Engineers. He said: "He spoke
for two hours without notes, beginning with the triangle of forces, and
carried us (carried is the word) through the subjects of trusses and the
braced arch, and made it seem to us as if we really understood the
methods and processes. At the conclusion the experienced stenographer
who took the talk said to me: 'He is a remarkable man. I never heard
anything like it. This matter is ready for the printer without revision.'"
A tablet of bronze is to be inscribed to his memory and set in the wall
of the new engineering building. It has been suggested to call this build-


ing the Greene Engineering Building. This is well. But he has left a
far more enduring memorial than any "built with hands." The present
department of engineering and the influence of a life well lived are monu-
ments which time cannot destroy nor can the ravages of the elements deface
them.
Nor was the mental in this man developed at the expense of the moral
and the spiritual. Each Sunday found him in his pew at church. His
many acts of kindness and courtesy to people in the humbler walks of life
were splendid examples of the brotherhood of man.
Our President, Theodore Roosevelt, in an address in New York, said:
"The true Christian is the true citizen, lofty of purpose, resolute in
endeavor, ready for a hero's deeds, but never looking down on his task
because it is cast in the day of small things; scornful of baseness, awake
to his own duties as well as to his rights, following the higher law with
reverence, and in this world doing all that in him lies, so that when death
comes he may feel that mankind is in some degree better because he has
lived."
Such was our honored Dean.


PROFESSOR C E. GREENE.
BY PRESIDENT JAMES B. ANCELL.
Professor Greene brought to his work a broad and generous training.
A graduate of Harvard College on the traditional classical course, and
afterwards of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a soldier in the
Civil war, and afterwards an engineer with varied practice in Maine, he
had had for a young man a large and fruitful experience when he was
called to the Chair of Civil Engineering in this University. His prede-
cessor, Professor Wood, had been a man of very demonstrative tempera-
ment, which, with other attractive qualities, made him a great favorite
with his classes.
When Professor Greene, with his quiet, reticent, undemonstrative tem-
perament, succeeded to Professor Wood's chair, it required a little time for
the students to appreciate his merits. But they came after a while to
understand that this unassuming man had much to teach them, and that
he was the sincere friend of every student who wished to do his duty. If
he had a little of the military strictness in requiring full work of every
man, they all learned that he held himself to the same fidelity in giving
them the most helpful and thorough instruction. The success of his pupils
in responsible posts is the proof of the value of his services to them, and
from all parts of the land have come from those pupils grateful acknowl-
edgments of their indebtedness to him and of their appreciation of him.
The letters which the writer has received from all the principal schools
of engineering in the country and from eminent engineers not engaged in
teaching, bear witness to the high esteem in which he was held for the
merits of his published works and for his sterling character.
The University owes him a debt of gratitude for the devoted service
which he rendered during the long period of thirty-one years. His
memory will be cherished like that of the other gifted and useful teachers
who have given their best years to this institution.

DEAN COOLEY.
PROF. J. B. DAVIS, '68.
At the January meeting of the Regents, Professor M. E. Cooley was
selected as the Dean of the Department of Engineering, to succeed Profes-
sor C. E. Greene, who was the first Dean of this department.
An excellent appreciative account of Dean Cooley's history was pub-
lished in the 1889 Technic. This is repeated here, and supplemented by
additional facts relating to the period covered, as well as by a recital of
subsequent events. The 1889 Technic is out of print, and the account
was written by ex-Regent S. S. Walker, a devoted personal friend of
Professor Cooley:
Professor Mortimer Elwyn Cooley, the subject of this sketch, was
born March 28, 1855, m tne township of Canandaigua, Ontario County,
N. Y., on a farm about four miles from the village of that name.
His early years were spent upon the farm, engaged in the usual avoca-
tions of fanners' sons "doing the chores," and as his strength increased
performing more and more of the hard work of the farm. He attended
the district school regularly for a few years, and then only winters, as his
help became more valuable during the active summer season.
The winter he was sixteen years old he attended the Canandaigua
Academy, hiring a room and boarding himself, and was expecting to do
so the following winter, but contrary to his desires, he was informed by
his father that he had engaged a school for him to teach, in the township
of Hopenell, a not distant neighborhood.
With reluctance he entered upon his duties, and perhaps with but little
interest in the profession that had been chosen for him. Interest, however,
was soon awakened, and the fact that the school was usually considered a
"hard one," and one in which more experienced teachers had recently
failed, acted as a stimulus. The row, not unusual under such circum-
stances, culminated about the fourth week in active hostilities, in which
the youthful teacher was victorious.
The next Monday morning found his school doubled in size, and to
the end of the term an interested and successful one was maintained.
Commencing the next fall term at the Academy, boarding at home,
walking four miles to school in the morning and returning the same dis-
tance on foot at night, that portion of the year he was enabled to attend is
now remembered by him as one of particularly good results. The long
walk was not lost time, for it was his custom to study his Geometry lesson
on the way; and the exercise was just sufficient to keep him in fine physical
condition. The year was not to be entirely devoted to study, for during
the winter term he was called upon to relieve the necessities of the trus-
tees in the district adjoining his old home, by completing the term in
teaching their school, returning to the Academy again at the close of those
duties for the balance of the year. While considering the prospects of a
college education, which were not altogether bright, an opening presented
itself at the United States Naval Academy, and during the summer of
1874 he entered his name with the Navy Department for an appointment as
Cadet Engineer, and was duly summoned to the Naval Academy at Annap-


olis for competitive examination in September, the savings from the winter
earnings by his school teaching sufficing to equip him for the trip and to
pay its expenses. The examination seemed very severe, and thinking he had
not passed he returned to Canandaigua, engaging to teach in the Academy
while continuing his studies. He was hardly settled in this position, when
to his surprise he was summoned by telegraph to report at once for duty
at the Naval Academy, the records showing that "of seventy-seven (77)
candidates examined for appointment in September, 1874, and from whom
twenty-seven (27) were appointed Cadet Engineers in the Navy, Mr.
Cooley passed number seven (7) in order of general merit." The official
letter giving the information adds, "and retained that number on the day
of his graduation, June 20, 1878."
Having completed his course at the Naval Academy, Sept. nth, 1878,
he was ordered to the "Quinnebaug," and in November, 1879, was trans-
ferred to the "Alliance," both vessels being then on the European Station.
In the "Quinnebaug" he made the usual European cruise, covering a part
of 1878 and 1879, visiting Port Mahone, Malaga, Tangiers, Algiers, Tunis,
Alexandria, Joppa, Smyrna, Constantinople, Athens, Trieste, Venice,
Naples, Nice and the Barbary coast. From Malaga he made a week's
excursion to Grenada and the Alhambra, and from Tunis he visited the
site of Ancient Carthage with his comrade engineer, W. C. Eaton, now
Professor at Madison University, whose extensive classical knowledge
and entertaining companionship made the trip one of peculiar interest and
value. From Joppa, with a party of officers from his vessel, he made an
excursion to Jerusalem, and from Naples, visited Pompeii and Herculan-
eum. Thus with many little excursions and incidents of the voyage, the
cruise passed most pleasantly, making for Professor Cooley enthusiastic
and enduring friends of his companions and giving him a great wealth of
pleasant memories. The "Alliance" on her return to the United States
was attached to the North Atlantic Squadron, and spent the summer of
1880 on the Newfoundland fishing banks, later in the season being ordered
to the West Indies.
December 3rd, 1880, he was detached from the "Alliance" and placed
on waiting orders. On March 29, 1881, he was ordered to special duty at
Ann Arbor, Michigan, under the law of 1879, by which certain officers of
the Navy are detailed to certain Educational Institutions as Instructors in
Steam Engineering and Ship Building. July 22nd, 1882, he was commis-
sioned as Assistant Engineer, to rank from June 22nd, 1880; In August,
1885, his resignation from the Navy was accepted, to date from January
1st 1886.
While still a student at Canandaigua Academy, Professor Cooley met
Miss Carrie E. Moseley, of Fairport, N. Y., then a student at Elmira
College. The life of a Naval officer under strict orders from the depart-
ment, and with long intervals of absence, is not always favorable to the
accomplishment of those dreams of companionship and home that nature
implants in mankind, but correspondence was possible, and visits were
occasional. On December 25th, 1880, Miss Moseley became Mrs. Cooley,
and it is not too much to infer that the charm of home-life and a most
interesting family were not unheeded arguments in determining his resig-
nation from the Navy.
The writer well remembers the advent of Professor Cooley at the
University, the interest among some, at least, of the officers of the Institu-
tion, which his enthusiasm and ability at once enkindled, the most meagre
outfit that the Regents were able to supply to the new department, only


a small temporary structure, 24x36 feet, to which afterwards were added
an unused carpenter shop and an old engine,— and perhaps better than
any one else, knew of, and sympathized with the dreams of the Young
Professor—dreams that have already become realities!
While the "Quinnebaug" was lying at Alexandria, the officers of the
City Water Works requested assistance from her commander in regulating
the pumping engines, which had been placed in their new system of water
works. The task was delegated to Cadet Cooley, and after a few days'
study the work was satisfactorily accomplished, and a report made cover-
ing the whole subject: this was received with great appreciation, and the
thanks of the company were extended to him.
The devotion of Professor Cooley to what he regards as his duty is
illustrated by the fact, long known to the writer, that early in his service
at the University he was approached to know, if he could not be induced
to become interested in one of the largest manufacturing establishments of
the country, in a position congenial to his taste, and at more than double
the salary of a full Professor of the University—he was then receiving
only the pay of an Assistant Engineer from the Government. The over-
tures were declined, for he "could not consider such a thing in the then
crude condition of the department he had engaged to serve, and his first
duty was to establish the Department of Mechanical Engineering in the
University of Michigan."
A shipmate relates: "I remember a long series of watches we were
obliged to stand in the engine room, three of us in three watches, four
hours on and eight off, night and day. This may not seem arduous work
to a landsman, but with the anxiety, trouble, and heat of the 'Quinne-
baug's' engine room, it was enough to break a man down in a very few
weeks. One night, having come off watch at 4 p. m., I turned in after
supper to get what sleep I could before my watch at midnight, and as I
climbed into my bunk I exclaimed, 'Oh! for a good sleep again, I am get-
ting worn out with these continued watches.' My first thought when called
for my watch was—'How refreshed I feel; never before did six hours'
sleep seem so long;' and on going to the engine room what was my surprise
to find Cooley there to be relieved, when I knew he had come off his
tiresome watch the evening previous at 8 p. m., or four hours later than I
had, and also to find the time to be 4 a. m. instead of midnight. It was
Cooley all over!" He adds: "This may seem a little thing to you, but I
tell you it is a sort of thing we rarely find in the Navy, or anywhere else,
and it serves to illustrate Cooley's generous nature and self-sacrifice for
others. It was simply Cooley, and the Cooley of that night was the
Cooley of all his life while I knew him."
Circumstances have been most fortunate, hoped for, but unexpected
possibilities have become realities, encouragement has been cordial, able
assistance and counsel have been given by the other members of the Fac-
ulty, notably by President Angell, Dr. Frieze, and Professors Greene,
Davis and Dennison, of the Engineering Department; but the greatest
element in the success of the Department of Mechanical Engineering has
been the enthusiastic devotion of Professor Cooley to the cause, and his
ability to induce a like interest in others. Indeed, the most necessary
qualification for a teacher or professor, more important even than high
scholarship, is the ability to create and maintain an interest and enthusi-
asm in the student. This gift Prosessor Cooley possesses in an eminent
degree, coupled with thorough equipment, and his success is not surprising.
Original researches with the class, the studying out of new problems,


and the proving them by actual results, is the best of discipline for the
students, and this is one of the means by which he succeeds in maintaining
their interest. Perhaps, however, we should not give Professor Cooley
too much credit on this score, for the aptitude of mankind for hand work
may have much to do with the attractiveness which laboratory and shop
work seem to possess. Until very recently hand labor has not been prop-
erly appreciated as a factor in education, and has even been frowned upon
as degrading in an educated man. In a recent work on the Ayran race,
it is claimed that the people of that race are not as faithful workmen as
those of some other races, "his energy being rather drafted off to the
region of the brain," and that this is more distinctly evinced, too, in the
Anglo-Saxon than in any other of the divisions of this great race. If
this is so, it is also a fact that the Anglo-Saxon has great adaptability to
hand labor directed by the mind, and delights in those studies where
skillful handiwork is a necessary requisite to the successful results sought
by the brain. Hand labor, the manipulation of tools, from a jack-knife to
an improved shaper or lathe, the handling of a pencil or graver, has
natural attractions for our race, and there are few who, at least as a
pastime, have not handled "tools," or dreamed of time and circumstances,
such that they might do so. This may be one of the reasons why labor-
atory work is so attractive, and why students of medicine look forward
to the practical study of anatomy with keener relish than to any other
portion of their course, and why the tables of the Chemical and Micro-
scopical Laboratories and the chairs of the Dental College are full, and
engaged before there is a vacancy, and why from its inception, and with
every increase of its facilities the Mechanical Laboratory has failed to
accommodate more than a part of those desiring to engage in manipulating
its tools and machinery, and why in those schools and institutions where
drawing, designing, carving and modeling are taught, the estimates of
facilities are always short of the actual demand.
As a youth of seventeen or eighteen, Mr. Cooley taught a district
school to get the money to pay his tuition at the Canandaigua Academy.
Thirty years afterward he is the official head of a school of engineering
where two-thirds of the students depend, in some measure, on themselves
for the expenses of their college course. Many a one of them likewise
taught a district school to get money to go to college with. Many a one
of them finds but little time for study. Good courage, lads, your Dean
studied his lessons as he walked back and forth between his home and
the Academy. You can find some way, he did. The real question is,
"Do you want an education?" That was what he wanted. That was what
took him to Annapolis. That was what made him find the hours to study
during the busy times of summer work on a farm, so that he might be
ready in September to take the examinations at the Naval Academy.
That is what makes young men now, here, in this city, study day by day,
as they work, or night by night, as they can, to be ready for the examina-
tions next September for entrance to this school where he is Dean. From
the book which they hold in one hand they gain the knowledge to enter
this school, while with the other hand they earn the money to keep them
here. So did he. So will such men do till such men cease to be. They,
like him, will come up to their examinations, with self distrust and dread.
Like him, also, they will be one of the twenty-five selected from the eighty,
or more, who apply, and, like him, they may keep their place in that file,
to their day of honorable graduation. Quite likely, too, they, like him,
may return home after their examinations so confident of failure as to take


up their duties again, as he did, believing his chance hopeless of entering
Annapolis. Here is a picture of it all as he once gave it.
"It was with no little anxiety that he went on to Annapolis for the
examinations, and this anxiety was not lessened when on his arrival he
found eighty or more other aspirants for the twenty-five coveted appoint-
ments. The few days in Annapolis were trying ones. In one room on the
top floor of the old Maryland Hotel, candidates from eight different
states lived. They did not sleep. The proprietor attempted to turn them
out every night, but as his guests grew accustomed to the racket, and found
it did not avail to protest, the young men staid on. Mr. Cooley faithfully
attended every examination, staying the full time and doing his level best.
"At the close of the examination he returned home, feeling he had
failed, and accepted a place as teacher in the Canandaigua Academy. A
couple of weeks later, a telegram was received at the Academy about
noon, ordering him to report without delay at Annapolis. The three and
one-half miles home were never traveled so fast, and that evening's train
took him away from home for good.
"Imagine his surprise on arriving to learn that he had passed number
seven, and this was his number also on graduation in June, 1878."
From such youthful experiences came our Dean. The fall after he
was nineteen in March, he left home for good. In four more years he
was graduated from the Naval Academy. On Christmas Day of the next
year he was married. Three years from graduation he was detailed by the
Navy Department to teach marine engineering and iron ship building in
the University of Michigan, in response to the first request for such a
detail under the Act of Congress of 1879 authorizing them. This was in
August, 1881. At the end of the three years, which was the regular period
for such assignments, the time was extended another year by special
request of our Regents. At the end of this year of extension, he resigned
from the Navy, being invited by the President of the University and the
Regents to accept the chair of Mechanical Engineering. This chair he
accepted. So it was that this youth, who, with trepidation, went to
Annapolis for his entrance examinations in September, 1874, in September,
1885, had so proven his fitness by four years of efficient service as to be
invited to become the head of Mechanical Engineering in a university.
Four years of the eleven were spent in the Naval Academy. Four years
more were spent here on detail. In seven years from graduation his life
work had found him, and taken possession of him. To every student and
teacher in the Department it can be said that our Dean knows our very
lives by having lived such a life himself. To those fortunate enough to
have to work hard for all they get, it can be said that our Dean is of that
sort,—he is one with them,—by their token he has entered into every
honor which has ever been bestowed upon him. Such men can afford to
fail, having done their very best, but they seldom do. To him, and to
them, come the real rewards of duties well done. For about twenty-three
years has Mr. Cooley faithfully labored to assist in building up what has
become our Department of Engineering, until, at the present time, not
only is it receiving a large and commodious building from the Regents,
accompanied by a very great increase in equipment, but as if in apprecia-
tion of what has been, and is being, done the attendance of students has
doubled the present college year. To this prosperity Mr. Cooley has con-
tributed his full share. Of him it may be said, that without his labors
the condition of the Department could not be what it is,—far from it.
But since 1889, the date of his published history, above quoted, other


events have been passing. In 1889, at the time that article was written, he
had been here about seven and one-half years of the twenty-three of his
residence in Ann Arbor.
In 1890 he was a member of the Board of Fire Commissioners of Ann
Arbor. In 1891 and 1892 he was President of the City Council. This is
an elective office, and in 1892 his name was on all tickets but one, so that
his election was without opposition at large. Of his fitness as a Fire Com-
missioner it is unnecessary to speak, and the results of his term on that
board remain to this day.
He is a Vice-President of the American Society of Mechanical En-
gineers. He is a Fellow of the American Society for the Advancement
of Science, and was Vice-President of the Section on Engineering for one
year. He is an active member of the American Society for the Promotion
of Engineering Education. He is also a member of the United States
Society of Naval Engineers, is a Past President of the Michigan Engi-
neering Society, a member of the Detroit Engineering Society, and of the
Engineering Society of the University of Michigan.
With these extended connections with the thinking and working men
of his time, one may readily believe that his beneficent influence is very
widely felt.
He has been enthusiastically welcomed to those more intimate associa-
tions open to such men, and has always exhibited such a hearty interest
therein, as to win for himself a regard that ever increases in respect and
devotion.
Not an author, in the literary sense, but a doer in the affairs of men,
he has been the author of a wealth of designs, and of plans, that not many
men have achieved who devote all their time to such things, and are not
engaged in preparing the foundation work of a school of engineering, as
well as discharging the routine duties of a teacher in that school. College
lectures, professional reports and papers, show the gift of authorship in
an extraordinary degree. Addresses of many kinds, and upon many and
various occasions, speak in the same terms. However, not in these direc-
tions has the work of his life lain. He has given himself to teaching, to
college and other administration, and to professional practice. His prac-
tical experience as an engineer covers a wide field, both territorially and
professionally. It is a long ways, professionally speaking, from the design
and equipment of that modest little shop in which his shop work began
here in 1881 and 1882 to the appraisal of the physical properties of all
specific tax paying concerns in the State of Michigan, in 1900,—a work
completed in six months' time, and covering all the railroads and their
steamships, all the telegraphs, telephones, plank roads, river improvements
privately owned, express lines, and private car lines, within the state. The
field work was done in ninety days, and covered property valued at 240
millions of dollars. It is a long ways, territorially, from the states of the
middle west, to the colony of New Foundland, and from Cuba to Canada,
yet this region, ample in extent for the purposes of an empire, is within
the field of his operations. Yet the line of his duties have been but barely
touched upon. A mere category of his professional labors that was in any
sense historical would fill more space than can be given to this article.
Called to Detroit in the Street Railway Appraisal in 1899. Called to New
Foundland in 1902 to appraise the mechanical equipment of the govern-
ment railways. Called to the service of his country in 1898, during the
Spanish War, he was Chief Engineer of the Yosemite,—the rank he would
have had if he had remained in the Navy instead of resigning in 1885, to


serve this University with that distinction that has always characterized
all his work. Called to receive a silver medal from his home city, Ann
Arbor, a bronze medal from Detroit, the home city of most of his men,
and another bronze medal from the State of Michigan in testimony of the
appreciation in which his services in the Spanish War were held by his
neighbors, his men and their relatives and neighbors, and by that great
State which fosters the institution of learning where he is a Dean, and to
the benefit of which he turns all his labors, duties, associations, and honors.
Called to be Dean of the Department of Engineering in the University of
Michigan by the students, the alumni, and the teachers of that Department,
and elected thereto by the unanimous vote of the Regents. Called to every
position because an able, efficient, and loyal worker was needed, who also,
could, and oftimes would, be a commander whom men would willingly
obey. Able, gifted, and broad enough for the first rank, yet never con-
cerned for his dignity, he is familiar with the details of his calling, both
theoretical and practical, to an extent that enables him efficiently to per-
form the simple duties of a workman with tools, or organize, and com-
mand, a staff that can embrace a State or a Nation in its operations.
Such is our Dean. Many, many more things ought to be said, but if these
few jerky memoranda furnish us with field notes enough to map out the
features referred to therein, it will be enough for now. Let us, then, not
disregard our impulses to honor and respect him, but rather let him know
of our esteem while we are privileged to be with him, instead of waiting
till perchance all we can do is to tell the world what a fine man he was.


PROFESSOR JOSEPH BAKER DAVIS, C E.
FREDERICK CHARLES WILSON, 02.
Professor Davis was born at Wesport, Bristol County, Mass., on the
31st of July, 1845. His ancestors were among the early settlers of Mass-
achusetts. His grandfather, Joseph Davis, was a blacksmith, and taught
the same trade to his son, Ebenezer H. Davis, the father of the subject of
this sketch. One thing for which Professor Davis is noted, is the thorough
and conscientious manner in which he does anything he undertakes; this
trait he gets from his father, who was a thorough master of the finer points
of his trade. Fifty years ago it was an especially difficult matter to temper
tools, owing to the imperfections in the manufacture of steel. His father
possessed the skill and experience in tempering to a high degree, and
became in time the person to whom was intrusted the tempering of tools
in a farm tool factory of considerable size. Owing to the discovery of
gold in California the factory found a ready sale for picks among the
miners. These picks stood the rough usage to which they were put so
well that the brand soon became a favorite on the coast, and the factory
had to run day and night to supply the demand from the Californian
market. Ebenezer Davis turned from this business to that of ship-rigger,
becoming a member of a gang of ship-riggers in New Bedford, Mass., pop-
ularly known as "Boss Cannon's Gang." This was during the time when
New Bedford was the greatest whaling port in the world, and "Boss Can-
non's Gang" was always called upon when a difficult piece of work had
to be performed. He became as much a master of this business as he had
been of the other, and in one particular case he planned the rigging of
one of the largest of whaling vessels, and bought the stock with such care
that all that remained when the vessel was ready for sailing was a yard
of rope. Another illustration of the conscientious labor he put upon his
work was in the splicing of a rope made for the Calumet and Hecla mines.
He, with the assistance of one helper, spliced a twelve-inch patent rope,
putting two and one-quarter days on the work, so well that while lying on
the floor the eye could not detect the splice. In the summer of 1861 he
bought a farm in North Dartmouth, Mass., about four miles out of New
Bedford, residing there until his death in January, 1804.
Professor Davis' mother, Mehitable C. Gifford Davis, was a woman
of unusually amiable and attractive character; she died when he was but
six months old. Miss Anstrus Baker, a cousin of his grandfather, and a
member of the Society of Friends, took the child. He was reared by her
and her mother on a rocky and poor New England farm until the fall of
1853. He had been named Joseph after his grandfather, but when he
passed into the charge of Miss Baker, her family name was added. She
was one of the calm, prudent, Quaker type, whose steady character,
unswerving devotion to duty and good deeds had given her judgment
unusual weight in the family. Her influence over the boy, acquired while
he was so young, remains unchanged. After he left home, he kept up a
correspondence with her, and often visited her. He was with her during
her last sickness, and traveled over a thousand miles to attend her funeral.


PROF. J. B. DAVIS


Mr. Davis' childhood was spent in the surroundings of the respectable
poverty of earlier New England. It was a peculiarly wholesome poverty
for mind and body, and from which has been derived much of the vigor
and thrift of the nation. He began his school life before the age of four.
The typical schoolhouse and teacher of the sterile farming districts of New
England were so picturesque that their features have not escaped the
writers of romance. A single room, abundance and variety of corporal
punishment, the head-long sports of healthy and happy boys and girls,
fresh air with no need of ventilating apparatus, woods and waters, form
a picture which from time to time comes back to the middle-aged workers
in office or class-room all over the country. To these there is to be added,
for southeastern Massachusetts, visions of winding country roads, bits of
fields hemmed in by stone walls, deciduous woods with an undergrowth
like hair, or pine woods free, open and fragrant, brooks, old beaver-dams,
ponds, cranberry marshes, huckleberry patches, mills turned by rock-
channelled streams, abundance of spring flowers, often very beautiful,
sheltered skating nooks with rallying fires on the ice, and abundant other
features, each in its season, all attractive to an active, healthy boy. Their
very poverty added a charm to their lives, for it held them nearer to
Nature's bosom. Homage to money was unknown, and character was the
only criterion for respect in these rural districts. To these features we
have to add, in this case, two others. The members of his family were
Friends, or closely associated with them, and his residence in or near New
Bedford brought him into close contact with those occupied with marine
pursuits. In those days, whale-fishing was pursued with great activity,
and the center of this activity was southeastern Massachusetts. Whale-
fishing is a picturesque and fascinating calling, and its influence on the
imagination of a young boy must always be notable. Mr. Davis' reminis-
cences are always full of pictures of whale-fishing.
In the fall of 1853 he went to New Bedford to live with his father, and
attended the public schools and high school until the fall of 1862, when he
went to live with his father on the farm purchased the summer before in
North Dartmouth. From here the father used to go into New Bedford on
business, and here young Davis spent the last year with his father's family.
He left high school ni&lt;.e months before graduation, and during the winter
of 1862 cut cordwood and lived at home. During the spring of 1863 he
went to work on the Round Hill farm on the west shore of Buzzard's Bay.
Wm. J. Waters, a friend and playmate, who was the protege of a
wealthy woman, was encouraged by her to obtain a college education. On
consultation with her cousin, who had been to Ann Arbor, Mr. Waters
decided to go there, and not wishing to go alone, picked young Davis as
a chum. Mr. Waters visited Davis at the above farm and endeavored to
persuade him to go to Ann Arbor. This he succeeded in doing, provided
Mr. Davis could obtain his father's consent. He—Davis—went to his
father, and said he would like to do one of two things, enlist in the army,
where he had a brother and a half-brother, or go to college. Having
received his father's encouragement to go to Ann Arbor in preference to
war, he returned to his work on Round Hill farm, keeping up a corres-
pondence with Mr. Waters who, however, soon decided to go elsewhere
for a time. Subsequently his friend went to Ann Arbor, and graduated
with two degrees. Mr. Davis made no alteration in his plans, on account
of the failure of his friend to go, and on September 8th, 1863, he left
New Bedford for the West, reaching Detroit early in the morning of
September nth. He had scarcely anything in his pockets, and what little


he had he paid to a man to find him employment, which he obtained before
the day was over, on the Brady farm, near Detroit, now a part of the D.
M. Ferry seed farm. He remained there one month, and then went to
work for a man who owned a sawmill nearby, staying with him during
the fall of 1863. From there he went to live with and work for a Mr.
Arnold in the township of Redford, on the north bank of the Rouge river.
Here he cut cord wood and worked for the neighbors until the following
April. He visited Ann Arbor in March, and went to Ann Arbor to stay
permanently in April, 1864. Here he worked in David DeForest's lumber
yards until September. At that time he took the examinations for entrance
to the University, and was admitted with high standing, his work in
English and mathematics being especially recommended.
He graduated in the class of 1868—a class which has probably left
more of its members in the University faculty than any other ever gradu-
ated there. In his University course, Mr. Davis' work was marked by the
characteristics which since has marked his life. His sterling manliness
and loyalty to his convictions gave him the thorough respect and confidence
of his instructors and classmates. His means were limited, and in addi-
tion to the work which he performed with his class mates, he had also to
provide for his own subsistence. This he did in such a way that his
standing as a student did not suffer. His genuine ability, his sturdy con-
scientiousness in his work, and his unremitting industry overcame all
obstacles, and kept him among the first in an unusually strong class.
Meanwhile, in all matters of college or class politics, his fellow students
were never in doubt as to where Davis would stand. His strong common
sense, with a tincture of Quakerism, was always his guide. His classmates
well remember the thick-set, strong, good-natured, deep-voiced, and fair
young man, plainly dressed, unpretentious, hearty in his bearing, and loyal
to his class and to his friends. In those closely associated with him at
this time, he aroused a feeling of affection which was founded on a basis
of respect and confidence. There is no sentiment that is more enduring
than an affection built on such a foundation. It can only be changed by
the conviction that the foundation is unsafe. In this case the sentiment
has remained unchanged through the thirty-six years which have elapsed
since the sturdy young Davis used to occupy the seat of a student.
In the season of 1867, and therefore while yet a student, Mr. Davis
spent the summer on Lake Superior in the employ of the United States
Lake Survey. The season was spent on soundings, on shore-line and
inland surveys, on a harbor survey at Chocolet river and on the Portage
entry base-line. In those days, members of the senior class in the Univer-
sity finished their course at class-day, then a month earlier than com-
mencement. Mr. Davis did not wait during this month to enjoy his new-
found ease, but went at once to Detroit, where he served in various capac-
ities in the City Engineer's office and as draftsman in an architect's office.
Indoor work, however, did not agree with him, and he soon accepted a
position on the Missouri River, Fort Scott &amp; Gulf Railroad. He went to
Kansas in the autumn of 1868, and was occupied with the preliminary
surveys and location of the north end of this road, or of that part which
is within the State of Kansas. He was here under the well-known engi-
neer, Mr. Octave Chanute, who built the Kansas City bridge over the
Missouri river, a feat considered impossible not ten years before it was
done. Mr. Davis had the good fortune to obtain Mr. Chanute's entire
confidence and esteem. In June, 1869, he returned to Michigan, and during
the summer and autumn was occupied in running a railroad line from


Owosso to Big Rapids, a distance of eighty-nine miles. By this fall he
had also succeeded in repaying a rather large debt, together with the
interest, incurred in obtaining his collegiate education. On the completion
of these surveys he returned to Massachusetts for a visit, after an absence
of six years. People around his old home during those days considered
a college graduate as more or less of a dude; so in order to remove that
impression and to show that he was still one of them, and had not for-
gotten old ways and habits, he took a contract to clear a piece of forest
land and split the trees into cordwood. My own recollection of how
cleverly and forcibly Professor Davis can swing an axe, as seen by me
during the summer camp of the Junior Civil Engineers in 1901, leads me
to think that he must have thoroughly convinced the natives that he was
still their peer, or better, with the axe.
It was while engaged upon this contract that Mr. Davis received a
letter from Mr. De Volson Wood, at that time Professor of Civil Engi-
neering, asking him to take a temporary position as instructor in the Civil
Department for the second semester of 1869-70. At the end of the college
year he left the teaching force and accepted employment on the Toledo &amp;
Ann Arbor Railroad, and during the summer he made three different sets
of preliminary surveys. The road was first laid out as a straight line
from city to city, but a bad place having been found in its course—a large
ridge near the middle of the line—an angle was introduced to avoid this
The third preliminary survey was made by way of Saline, but with no
serious object in view, simply for general information for the company.
However, none of these surveys were used in the final location of the line,
a large detour having been decided upon instead of the straight line route.
In the fall of 1870 he was engaged by the Jackson, Lansing &amp; Saginaw
Railroad to make the preliminary and location surveys for the northern
extension of that line. His value in this class of work was so quickly
appreciated by the Chief Engineer that his salary was raised three times
in the first three months, at the end of which time he was made the
Assistant Chief Engineer in charge of location. He made the exploratory
surveys from West Bay City to Gaylord and the location surveys nearly to
Grayling. In the autumn of 1871 he went to Swarthmore, Penn., to organ-
ize the Civil Engineering course in the Friend's College at that place. In
June, 1872, he was made Assistant Professor of Civil Engineering in the
University of Michigan, which position he held until 1891, when he was
appointed to the chair he now occupies, Professor of Geodesv and Sur-
veying. In January of the present year he was appointed Associate Dean
of the Engineering Department, sharing with Professor Cooley the respon-
sibilities of shaping the policy of the school, which position was so ably
filled by our late and respected leader, Professor Charles E. Greene.
In July, 1872, he married Miss Mary Hubbard Baldwin, daughter of
Deacon J. D. Baldwin, of Ann Arbor. Three children have been born to
them, but only one, Charles, lived. Charles Davis followed his father's
footsteps, going through the University and graduating with the degree
of Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering with the class of 1001. He
has since then married, was assistant to his father in the surveying work
one semester, and is now located in Pratt City, Jefferson Co., Ala., where
a bright future seems to be in store for him. The same energy and exact-
ness which characterize the father are to be observed in the son, who is
ably capable of carrying on his father's work in the outer sphere of use-
fulness.


As a teacher Professor Davis is pre-eminently successful. He has
always been able to arouse the dormant desire for investigation in his
students, and many valuable papers have been handed in by them upon
subjects not often touched upon in engineering work. He is as frank
and loyal in his relations with his students now as he was with his fellow
students when an undergraduate, and these qualities have endeared him to
all who have passed under his instruction. He is a natural leader, and has
that faculty of bringing out all that is best in a student, which is the proof
of a natural and successful teacher. Professor Davis would not hurt any-
one's feelings if he could possibly avoid doing so. It hurts him far more
than it does his hearer to have to tell a student that he is not qualified to
follow up his work; yet when such an occasion arises, he is always one
of the first to so notify the student, giving him advice as to what course
could best be followed, and gently advising him, if necessary, that engi-
neering is not that student's forte without wounding the sensibilities of his
hearer. Being an exact, careful and conscientious worker himself, Pro-
fessor Davis insists that his students be equally so. He will not counten-
ance rough or careless work, and will patiently spend his time impressing
his pupils with the fact that exactness in work, and carefulness in design
or execution are the most important things an engineer must acquire
Simple ideas, which must always be observed in surveying work, are
usually conveyed with a story with a point to it; and the story always
sticks, consequently the idea. For instance, while he was talking about use
and care of instruments he may call attention to the fact that instruments
are frequently injured by careless carrying. To give pointedness to the
talk, he told in one class of a young man who carried an axe and a transit
over one shoulder; while telling it he settled back in his chair with a
smile all over his face, and wound up as follows: "The axe probably cost
$200.00, the transit maybe $1.00—The axe wasn't hurt any." After hearing
it one never forgets if an instrument is to be carried to make sure to carry
only that on his shoulder. As another illustration, we may tell how he
impresses upon the student to always take his readings upon permanent
objects. Relating his own experience upon one occasion, when he had set
up and read upon a large white rock across a valley and carefully recorded
the same, only to find out when he started to measure an angle from it
that "the cow had moved!"
Professor Davis has written very little. A paper once in a while, to
be read before some society, or perhaps a pamphlet for class use. He has
been too busy both in school work and in outside professional work to put
much time on writing for publication. He has always been a very busy
man, and has always kept up his practice as an engineer and surveyor,
often being obliged to turn away work for want of time to give to it.
Years ago he was appointed City Engineer of Ann Arbor, and held that
office for sixteen years. Professor Davis' record of monuments is in the
most complete and compact form. In 1874 he became a Junior in the
American Society of Civil Engineers, and was probably the Junior of
longest standing in the society when he became a Member in 1897; his
advance to standing as a Member having been made at his own request.
He has always taken a prominent part in the Michigan Engineering So-
ciety, and in 1883 was made its President, and held the position for three
consecutive terms. He has held that position also in recent years. He
was for two years Vice-President of the "Council of Engineering Societies
in National Public Works;" he has been a Consulting Engineer for the
Flint &amp; Pere Marquette Railroad, and held a like position with the Toledo,


Ann Arbor &amp; Northern Michigan Railroad until 1804. He has patented
a solar attachment for transits, to be used for determining the direction
of a line, and thence a meridian if desired. This is manufactured by C. L.
Berger &amp; Sons, makers of surveying and scientific instruments. Professor
Davis' specialty is, of course, surveying in all its branches, but he has
taken great interest and activity in other branches of civil engineering,
particularly highway construction and bridge work. Many such have been
built according to his designs and specifications. The water works problem
has also come in for his close attention. He was consulted during the
construction of the system of water supply at Owosso, Mich. The water
works at Greenville, Mich., which he built at a cost of $45,000, are a stand-
ing illustration of the effectiveness, thoroughness, and economy of his
plans. He takes especial interest in that exasperating duty of surveyors—
that of finding missing corners,—and never gives up until tact, experience,
time and labor have all been exhausted in the hope of relocating them.
Professor Davis' most noted piece of work is the St. Clair Flats sur-
vey. The difficulties under which the work was carried on were enough
to stagger any engineer, yet were met and overcome by him with character-
istic energy and skill. One of the Government junior engineers, at present
with the Detroit River Improvement corps, has stated that the resourceful-
ness shown by the Chief Engineer upon the St. Clair Flats survey is the
greatest tribute he can give the man. It took three years to complete the
work, the survey covering 540 miles. The total cost to the State was
$52,545.27, or cost per mile, $97.30, which considering the difficulties met
with, is an object lesson for others to attain. In closing this sketch, I
append a paragraph from Professor Davis' report to the Commissioners
of the State Land Office.—"I began preparations for this work within
four days after receiving my commission. Information was gathered and
the Flats visited. I soon found that everything required for this survey
would have to be taken there from elsewhere,—even to stake timber and
kindling wood. The exceptional characteristics of the Flats, the nature
of the claims there, and the requirements of the statute, made necessary a
survey of an unusual kind. Shelter and subsistence had to be provided,
and office accommodations as well. Quarter boats were used, which are
described in the report of the Resident Engineer. Instruments had to be
set up, and measurements made, as frequently as in laying out lots for a
subdivision in a city. The work was to be carried on over lands that were
farm lands at the upper end of the Flats, and that were six feet under
water at the Lake St. Clair front, with every stage of wetness between.
The hundreds of lots were to be spread over forty or fifty miles of frontage
on widely separated channels. The lots were to be of any shape. There
were miles and miles of water not over two feet deep. There were square
miles of marsh vegetation through which unnumbered lines must be run.
There were winds of great severity. Special tools and equipment had to
be devised and made to meet the requirements of the case."
Note.—The author of this article desires to acknowledge his indebted-
ness to Professor M. W. Harrington, a close, personal friend and class-
mate of Professor Davis. That part of Mr. Harrington's article on Pro-
fessor Davis, which deals with his youthful environments and school
work, in the 1891 Technic, has been largely drawn upon, since his knowl-
edge of the early Davis was founded on long, personal association.


DRAFTING ROOM SYSTEM.
GEORGE A. WORDEN.
The value of the drafting room in a manufacturing plant, where the
product does not depend directly on the work of the draftsman, is
usually, I think, rather underestimated. There is not much doubt but
that my views on this subject may be biased, but if a drafting room is
worth having at all, why not have as good and efficient a one as possible.
I don't believe that the conditions in any two offices are exactly the
same, so naturally the systems must be different. The technical press now
devotes considerable space to descriptions of different drafting room sys-
tems, and not infrequently some feeling seems to be aroused between the
champions of different systems regarding which is the better, when, no
doubt, either one would be a failure in the other office.
There are, perhaps, better systems for the office which I am writing
about, but the one we are using now works nicely and gives very good
satisfaction.
An order, with a duplicate, is written out either by the man desiring
work done or by the chief draftsman, for every piece of work which
comes into the office. On this order is a brief description of the work,
and, if there be any rough sketches, they are attached to the duplicate
order. On the order is also placed a time limit within which time the
drafting room work* must be completed. If the chief draftsman thinks
that the time given is too short in which to complete the design, he com-
municates with the man who sent in the order to that effect When the
chief draftsman accepts the order he binds himself to complete the work
within the time limit specified.
The orders for work are filed away according to their importance and
to the date when they are due to be completed.
When work is given to a draftsman it is explained to him fully—
why it is to be done, what the newly designed apparatus is desired to
accomplish, the difficulties with the present piece of apparatus, if there be
one,—in short, the draftsman is briefly given all the available inform-
ation on the subject on which he is to work, and suggestions as to how it
may be accomplished. He is also given, for reference, the duplicate copy
of the order, which he returns on the completion of the work.
The time a man spends on each job is accurately kept, and upon the
completion of each piece of work its cost is figured. The cost is marked
on the order and duplicate. The order, with blueprints of the work, is


sent to the man who ordered it, and the duplicate order is kept on file in
the drafting room.
This system may seem to call for considerable "red tape," but in
operation it is really very simple, and enables the chief draftsman to know
all the time just what a man is doing and how much his services are worth
to the company.
The cost records are always open to the draftsmen, and there is con-
siderable good-natured competition among the men to keep their costs
low and the volume of work they turn out large.
At the end of each week a complete list of the number of jobs com-
pleted that week, with the cost of each, is sent to the chief engineer, so
that, in a glance, he can tell the progress of work on hand, and is enabled
to get an idea of the efficiency of the drafting room.
The next system which I will attempt to outline is that which has
to do with the recording, indexing and filing of our blueprints and tracings.
At present we have on file in our vault about fifteen thousand blue-
prints, charged to us by another plant of the company; about three thou-
sand "foreign" blueprints, or blueprints which are charged to us by out-
side concerns; five hundred of our own blueprints and eight hundred
tracings.
When a blueprint comes into the office it is stamped on the back with
a regular receiving stamp, which gives the date. It is then recorded. It
may be well to say here that we use the card index system throughout.
A card is made out with the number of the print at the top, its date of
receipt, date the blueprint was made, and the number of copies of this
number received,—all recorded in the proper spaces on this special card.
There is also a space for record of prints which we may return, giving
date of returning and number of copies. At the bottom of the card is left
a space for the title of the blueprint. These cards are all filed away
according to number, and serve as a numerical index to the prints.
The prints are now ready to be cross-indexed. Our index system has
been built on the principle that a man without an especial knowledge of
engineering or the works of the company would have no difficulty in find-
ing a drawing of anything in the works which a man might ask for, or, in
other words, all our drawings have been rather elaborately "cross-indexed."
We will say that the drawing we have to index is the design of a
gas burner, used in the machine shop gas furnace. The cards, which are
just plain index cards, with a space at the bottom left for the number of
the drawing, would be made out as follows:
Burner, Machine Shop Gas Furnace.
Furnace, Burner for Machine Shop Gas.
Gas Furnace, Burner for Machine Shop.
In our index we make a main division with its subordinate indexes.
This main division is arranged alphabetically, indicated by red spacer


cards, and includes all general headings, such as Apparatus, Axles, Barns,
Boiler House, Buildings, etc. Under each one of these headings there is
another subordinate index arranged alphabetically, the same as the first,
but indicated by buff spacer cards. For example, under the heading
Buildings comes Blacksmith Shop, Boiler House, Machine Shop, etc.
Under these headings comes still another index, indicated by blue spacers,
as under Machine Shop we would find Cranes, Drill, Engine, Furnace, etc.
A subject like "Boiler House" would appear on a red spacer, and
this would refer you to the proper place to find "Boiler House," namely,
under "Buildings."
In finding the cards made out for the Machine Shop Furnace Burner,
the first would go under the red spacer "Furnaces," under the buff spacer
"Burners," and, were there enough cards under "Burners'* to warrant,
would be placed under the blue spacer "Gas." The second card would be
placed under the red spacer "Buildings," under the buff spacer "Machine
Shop," and in its proper order alphabetically, there not being enough
furnaces in the "Machine Shop" to make a blue spacer for "Furnaces"
necessary, under that heading. The third card would be made out as a
red spacer, and on it would be a note referring you to "Furnaces."
This system really seems quite complicated to me as I write about
it, but I assure you it is quite simple and without doubt one of the most
efficient time saving devices in the office. I may add, in concluding the
subject of indexes, that every blueprint, foreign as well as our own, and
all our own tracings, are indexed under this system so that all our details
of one thing, as sprockets, for instance, will appear in one place in the
index, and we are able to tell at a glance just what sprockets, their num-
ber of teeth, pitch, etc., we have available for use without designing a
new one. The tracings are all indexed before a print is made from them.
All the catalogues we receive are given a file number immediately
upon their receipt, and are known by this file number according to their
subject matter, and indexed similarly to the blueprints, only not so elab-
orately, of course. The catalogues are also indexed according to firms.
Our system of filing blueprints of all sorts, drawings and catalogues
is the simplest possible. They are all arranged according to number, the
prints charged to us from our other plant in one place, the foreign in
another, our drawings and tracings—separate, of course—in another, all
easily accessible. Ordinarily I should think it would be more advisable to
have the blueprints, that is, foreign and domestic, filed together, numer-
ically, and we would not separate them as we do but for the fact that we
use our own blueprints so much more than the others, that it is a little
easier to have them separate.
Every blueprint which leaves the office is charged out, and the man
who desires the print must sign a receipt for it. This makes him respon-


sible for it until it is returned to the office. These receipt cards are made
in duplicate, the duplicate being filed separately and numerically, so that
we can tell just what prints are out and where they are. The receipts
proper are filed according to the names of the persons having the prints,
thus enabling us to know how many and what prints each man has.
With this system we know all the time how many prints we have,
their dates, "the dates we received them or made them," where they are
and all about them.
Our standards of bearings, fittings, etc., which are made up in book
form, and of which each draftsman has a copy, involves another elaborate
system for its maintenance, but I will not attempt to detail it here. We
also have a bulletin board on which store stock, special details and other
information of importance to the draftsman is kept.
While we try to have all the work in the office traced by the regular
tracers, who do nothing else, yet occasionally work which is being rushed
will be traced by the draftsman. Full rules for tracing, lettering, and
dimensioning drawings are given in our regular office rules, so that all
the work turned out in the office is uniform in style and general
appearance.
Every office must have some system. Our system has to be exact, as
the company is especially particular who knows about its designs, and it
is very likely more detailed than is necessary with most plants, but in
conclusion I can only repeat what I said before, that different conditions
require different methods of operation and each problem must be worked
out and mastered as it appears. That was the way our system grew up,
and it is still growing.


SWITCHBOARD AND PANEL BOARD DESIGN AND
CONSTRUCTION.
ARTHUR FRANTZEN, '92, M. E., E. E.
Of all departments connected with the installation of an isolated
electric lighting and power plant, none have been found more interesting
than that of switchboard and panel board design and the construction of
same in shops.
The engineer is confronted with many interesting problems which it
is necessary to overcome, bearing in mind continually the idea that the
solution must be attained without sacrificing simplicity, and to obtain the
greatest flexibility at a minimum cost for the best of appliances and
material.
It is the intention of this article to present only this topic as applied
to isolated electric light plants in public buildings, hotels, hospitals, office
buildings and other structures of similar type.
The requirements of such buildings being entirely different from that
of central station lighting or street railway plants.
The first questions that arise in designing a switchboard are:
The number of generators or units to be provided, for source of
supply to switchboard?
The voltage of the dynamos?
Whether a two or three-wire system?
The number of feeder circuits to be provided for on the switchboard?
In fact, the engineer must be thoroughly familiar with every detail
and requirement before attempting any design whatever.
Figure No. I illustrates the main switchboard to be installed in the
engine room of the United States' Post Office and Custom House building
at Chicago, 111., now in course of construction.
The switchboard consists of 17 panels 7'-o" high and 24" wide, made
of Blue Vermont marble of a dark, rich color and highly polished.
Panels No. 1 to No. 10, inclusive, counting from the left, are used
for lighting feeders, each having a 600-ampere, 3-pole, double-throw
switch, and two 600-ampere ammeters mounted thereon.
Panels No. 11, 12, 13 are power feeder panels, each having a 1000-
ampere double-pole, double-throw switch, iooo-ampere single-pole circuit
breaker, and a iooo-ampere ammeter.
Panels Nos. 14 and 15 are recording panels containing recording volt-
meter, ammeters, and wattmeters for measuring and recording amount of
current and power consumed.
Panels Nos. 16 and 17 are totalizing panels, containing two illumi-
nated dial voltmeters and ammeters, three 5000-ampere single-pole, single-
throw switches, three voltmeter switches and one portable voltmeter
mounted on a marble shelf.
This switchboard has no generator panels, as the source of supply is
a central station lighting plant, and recording panels were installed to aid
in estimating the size of generators necessary to meet requirements of the
building, and provision has been made in the design for future addition
of generator panels.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC.
All instruments are provided with a pilot lamp with half-pear shade,
which shields the eye and gives a bright light on the dial, so that same
can be easily read.
In order to enhance the appearance of the switchboard, an ornamental
scroll and clock has been placed over the center, which adds very materially
to its beauty.
The entire switchboard is secured to an angle iron frame with 2-3"x2"
angle irons forming 3"x4" vertical T iron supports, secured with hori-
zontal pieces of 3"x3" angle iron. The frame is firmly bolted to floor and
braced to wall along the upper edge of frame, the switchboard being
located about three feet from wall, for easy access to rear of same.
Figure No. 2 represents a detail of bus-bar design in rear of Panels
Nos. 10 and II. There are two sets of three-wire bus-bars connected to
double-throw switches. Upper set of bus-bars are to be connected to gen-

erators, and lower set to central station service, thus ennabling switch-
board operator to furnish current from outside source instantly, should
it be desirable to shut down the generators.
All feeders are connected to lugs secured on upper panel in rear of
board, and protected by fuses mounted on panel in rear of middle of
switchboard. The fuse and lug panels are supported on ij^'xij^" angle
iron secured to main frame.

All meters are provided with shunts, connected in series with bus-bar
branches that are to supply current to be measured. Meters and switches
are not shown on face of board in sectional views A-A and B-B.
The majority of drawings have a scale of J4", or IJ4" to the
foot, but in laying out work on each panel for drilling, full size scale only
is used. A panel is laid on a bench with plain paper pasted over entire

have been drilled, panel is then secured to iron frame ready for mount-
ing instruments as soon as paper has been washed from face of board.

SECTION.


When all instruments and appliances have been mounted on face of
board, the bus-bars are then connected to studs projecting through marble.
When bus-bars are of large capacity they are made up of laminations and
supported on iron brackets, insulated from bus-bars with pieces of slate
In switchboard design and construction everything is exposed and
always accessible and easily made safe and secure; but with panel boards or
distributing centers, which are generally set flush in walls or shafts, and
are subjected to abuse from careless users, a different problem is presented.
The construction of the building and manner of running conduits for
circuits enter largely into the type and design of panel board to be used;
ease of installation and connecting of wires being very important features.
In Figure No. 3 is shown an iron cutout cabinet with gutter type
panel board placed in same.
The iron cabinet consists of heavy sheet-iron sides with iron doors
and no back. The main panel is supported on angle iron fastened to sides
of cabinet, and gutter is formed by securing marble or slate pieces to iron
strips fastened on iron box. The conduits enter along top, bottom or sides
of cabinet, with wires extending .into gutter and out through holes drilled
in side of slate strips to contact on switch.
All connections are accessible, and wires are easily removed and
replaced by removing cover of gutters. It can be' readily seen that all
wires are incased in a fire-proof space, surrounded with slate and iron.
All circuit switches are provided with spade or plain cross-bar handles.
Figure No. 4 illustrates an iron cabinet similar to Figure No. 3, except-
ing that an iron back is necessary to obtain a fire-proof compartment in
rear of panel.
The panel board is made in three pieces, the two outer strips contain-
ing wire contacts and circuit name plates. The center panel is not set in
place until all wires have been extended from conduits through holes in
outer strips of marble to contact connections.
The removal of center section gives easy access for the connection of
all circuits to their respective switches. Gutters are placed in top and
bottom, to give more room for conduits to enter box.
The main bus-bar feeds are run on back of center panel, thus avoiding
any cross-overs of main bus-bars and circuit strips.
Figure No. 5 illustrates a cabinet similar to Figure No. 4, without
gutters, the entire space back of panels being a large compartment about
4" deep. Cut shows panel before being placed in iron cabinet.
In order to connect wiring to switches, the second and fourth panels
are removed, leaving ample room to reach behind the remaining panels
to connect all circuits to their respective switches.
As soon as all wires are connected, the second and fourth panels are
placed in position, and fuses are then connected to terminals.
The two small three-pole and the double-pole switches are for inde-
pendent control, and are not connected to bus-bars or circuits.
Figure No. 6 illustrates a simple three-wire panel board with main
switch, which is used in cheaper construction and mounted in asbestos-
lined wood cabinets, where wiring is run in moulding or exposed on cleats.
Enclosed fuses are shown in place.
Figure No. 7 illustrates a type of panel board construction that is
decidedly novel,and obviates assembling and collecting of wires in compart-
ments. Each conduit is brought direct to within a few inches of its switch.



Fig. 5—fifty circcit panel board, sectional type Fig. 6 thirty-two circiit panel board


The main panel is placed vertically, and distributing panels are placed
at an angle, to allow placing conduits in position between the various
panels.
The conduits terminate in an iron plate secured to sides of iron
cabinet, which has no iron back.
The main bus-bar feeds are made in sections and clamped together, so
that each panel can be removed independently of the other.
The handsome department store of Schlesinger &amp; Mayer, of Chicago,
is fitted throughout with this type of cabinets and panel boards.
There are numerous other types of panel boards constructed, but a
large number of them have the wiring arranged so that same is hazardous
and unsafe, and few of them are thoroughly accessible without doing con-
siderable damage to building when changes in circuits are necessary.
Modern requirements compel distributing centers or panel boards to be
designed so that all wiring and fuses are encased in non-combustible
enclosures, and this necessity has brought out many ingenious arrange-
ments to fit the varied conditions that arise in the many types of building
construction.


GOOD ROADS—WHO SHOULD BUILD THEM.
JAMES N. HATCH, 92, C. E.
The question of the improvement of public highways in the United
States is by no means a new question, but an old one revived.
During the early colonial development of this country little was done
in the way of road building. The first settlements being confined to a
narrow strip along the Atlantic coast, there was not much occasion for
commercial intercourse with the interior portions of the country, and there
was but scant necessity for wagon roads. Even after settlement had
begun to penetrate some little distance inland it was found mostly along
the banks of navigable streams or on the shores of the inland lakes.
What scant commerce there was between the different colonies was carried
on by means of small boats, or perhaps occasionally by the aid of pack
horses that were urged along the old Indian trails.
These narrow, mysterious trails "led from the settlement along the
coast to the interior, and aside from an occasional rude path beside some
stream or along the coast, these were the only lines of communication up
to the end of the seventeenth century. Indeed, for a century after the
settlement at Plymouth Rock there were few roads in this country over
which goods or passengers could be transported in wagons or carriages."
But in the early part of the eighteenth century, with the extended
internal development of the country, public highwavs to form a more
direct and expeditious communication between the different settlements
became a public necessity. One of the earliest of the great American
roads which we have any record of is "The Old York Road," connecting
New York with Philadelphia, built in 1711. Such roads as this, forming a
somewhat direct line between communities, having the worst streams
bridged and the hillsides graded, were a vast improvement over anything
that had been previously seen on this continent; but with the increase in
the use of roads and with heavier traffic, these old dirt roads became
inadequate. In the early half of the eighteenth century the cry had been
for roads, before the end of the century the cry was for good roads.
As the wagon road was the only outlet for the inland commerce,
which, during the latter part of the eighteenth and the beginning of the
nineteenth centuries, had, with the great increase in manufacture and the
rapid development of the natural resources, become of vast proportions,
the proper growth of civilization absolutely depended on the best roads
possible, both for the transportation of heavy freight and the rapid
carrying of passengers and mail.
Private capital built and maintained many of these early roads, and
operated them as toll roads. But this private ownership of public high-
ways was soon found to be a menace to the best interests of the country,
so the Government took up the question of road building and set aside
a certain amount each year for this purpose. The making of good roads
developed into a national issue, and next to tariff was the most important
that was discussed in Congress. Thus it was that good roads in these
early times were absolute necessities. The development of the country


'
was sadly impeded without them; the protection of frontier demanded
them; they had become a money-saving, money-earning commodity.
In the early part of the nineteenth century, with the introduction and
rapid growth of the railroad, this demand for good roads rapidly waned.
And in a surprisingly short time a question that had been one of the most
important national issues had dropped to a question of only very secondary
importance. The manufacturers scarcely needed roads at all; the mail
service needed them only for very light traffic; and the travelling public
could dispense with them almost entirely. The military road, which had
been constructed at so much expense and with such great care, was
allowed to grow up in weeds.
So, good roads as an important factor in the development of the
country became a thing of the past. The great interest that had been
manifested rapidly died out. Good road experts found the demand for
their services suddenly drop to a low ebb, and the science of road build-
ing again received a setback, as it had received many since the time of
the old Roman roads.
But now, as our country has become more thickly settled and our
cities and towns have become located where they must remain, since the
railroads have become about as numerous as the country can support and
the lines of the highways have been pretty definitely settled, we again
find ourselves using thousands upon thousands of miles of country roads.
In fact the amount of wagon roads in use today is many times as great
as in the time of the national turnpike and the lumbering stage coach.
An immense amount of the products of the land at present is of necessity
moved by wagon over a country road. But the problem as it is presented
today is very different from that of a hundred years ago. Then the good
road was needed by all the people, and progress was badly impeded by a
lack of it. Now it is needed only by a certain element, and its advantages
are very much less apparent to the people at large.
The question arises now, as it did in the early history of road build-
ing, as to who shall pay for the improvement. Should good roads be built
by the Government, the States, the counties, or should they be built and
maintained by the individuals needing them most? If the latter course is
to be pursued, who are those individuals needing them most? The answer
comes from every quarter that it is the farmer. And there is a great deal
of energy expended trying to prove to the farmer that good roads are to
be a great advantage to him; that they will save horse flesh and wagon
wear and improve his good nature. In fact there are articles and speeches
without number trying to prove to the farmer that he is standing in the
way of his own advancement by not subscribing money to build these
roads. Still the farmer doesn't seem to comprehend the situation in that
light. And his abject ignorance and benighted enterprise is deplored by
an army of bicyclists and automobilists the land over. Perhaps a little
impartial study on the subject of the value of good roads may help us to
decide where to place the responsibility of our present bad ones. In the
first place let us consider the question, whether good roads are a necessity
and a financial advantage to a community or should they be looked upon
rather as a convenience and a luxury only. If this question can be settled,
the question of who should build the roads may be easier to solve.
As the farmer is the one who depends on the country roads more,
perhaps, than any one else, and to whom a passable highway is absolutely
indispensible, let us inquire whether good roads are to him a luxury or an
advantage in a pecuniary sense. What is meant here by good roads are


roads that have been improved to such an extent that they are firm and
hard and smooth at all times of year and under all climatic conditions.
Are such roads as these a paying investment to the farmer? They are
certainly a convenience, but in dollars and cents are they an advantage?
There is such a diversified farming interest that it may be well to
make our inquiry more concrete. Let us take, for example, the prairie
farmer in the Mississippi Valley; how could his yearly proceeds be aug-
mented by better roads than are in general use in that section? Suppose
he has eighty acres, of which ten acres is pasture, fifteen acres hay land,
thirty acres corn and wheat, ten acres oats and the remaining fifteen acres
garden, fruit, etc. From the pasture and the hay land he will expect to
produce little that will be hauled away, unless it be a few loads of hay.
On the forty acres of cereals suppose he raises an average of twenty-five
bushels to the acre, or a thousand bushels. At sixty pounds to the bushel
this would be sixty thousand pounds. Supposing he were to haul all of
this to market, which is not at all probable, it would make not over twenty
loads for an average farm team over an average country road. The
remainder of his produce he will haul in small loads of a few hundred
pounds each on a light wagon that two strong horses can haul through
almost any kind of roads.
The horses that he will need to cultivate his land during the Spring
and Summer will be more than he can possibly utilize in the Fall to haul
his produce to market. Besides, most farmers raise a few head of horses
each year, and generally have more than they have actual use for even
on the farm.
If instead of the prairie farmer we had taken the stock rancher, or
the bee-keeper, or the poultry raiser, we would have found that these
have less use still for good roads. Had we chosen a dairyman or a truck
gardener, it might seem at first sight that good roads would certainly be
a direct financial benefit, but a more careful inquiry will show that even to
these the benefit is more apparent than real. A good road would be a very
decided advantage to a dairyman if it extended from his door to every
ramification of his route, but if there is a single half mile anywhere on
the route, of bad road, a single street or alley that is deep in mud, he will
have to have a team that can pull him through this bad stretch, and with
only a little more work they could pull him through several bad stretches.
The same argument would hold with the gardener. And it is doubtful if
any important branch of farming could be found where good roads would
be a real financial benefit. Of course a good road alongside a farm
enhances its value, but this is only because there are so few good roads
throughout the country, and would not be so noticeable if good roads
were general. Furthermore, there is no advantage to the farmer to have
his land appreciate in value so long as he does not wish to sell. It does
not make it produce any more, and, on the other hand, brings a heavier
burden of tax on the owner.
If, then, good roads are not a pecuniary benefit to the farmer, to
whom are they truly profitable? Not certainly to the manufacturers, who
haul no goods over them, or the town people, who seldom see them.
Perhaps it would be difficult to pick out any considerable number of
people who would really profit financially, but this does not mean that
therefore there is no good excuse for building them.
The distinction must here be made between that which is a financial
benefit and that which may be looked upon as a convenience or a luxury.
A glance about us will make it manifest that among the better classes of


people only a small amount of our income is expended for real necessities,
while the larger share goes for luxuries. The farmer has handsome
driving horses, good harness with nickel-plated trimmings, and easy riding
carriages; the business man buys beautiful furniture, pays money to have
his lawn cared for, and has his house adorned with art glass. Our school-
houses and churches have thousands of dollars expended in adornments
and conveniences, when it is certain that no profit can accrue from these
outlays.
A good road must be looked upon largely as a luxury, and especially
so to the ordinary farmer. The coal man may find it a financial benefit,
or the man who owns a stone quarry or a sand bank, but the farmer can
get along well enough if the road is simply passable. In the city, good
streets are an absolute necessity. The merchant saves so much on each
load of goods that is hauled from the depot; the coal man on every ton
of coal he delivers, and the contractor on every load of brick he receives.
But this in general is not the case with the country road. The amount
saved by having a first-class turnpike over which a bicyclist can ride com-
fortably at ten or twelve miles an hour, over using an ordinary dirt road
in a well-drained district, is not, to the majority who use a country road,
a very significant amount.
The demand for good roads is increasing as the demand for all other
modern improvements is increasing, but this demand is by a class of
people seeking luxury and not those who feel that their incomes could be
augmented by such roads. It is the bicyclist, the automobilist and the
drivers of fancy turnouts who are clamoring for improved highways, and
this cry is increasing as the well-to-do classes are constantly moving
farther and farther from the center of large cities to suburban and
country-side homes.
Now, because good roads are not an absolute necessity or a financial
benefit does not say that they are not of importance enough to justify the
expenditure of the amount of capital necessary for their improvement.
Beautiful hedgerows on either side of the road are no real advantage to
the uitility of the road, neither are ornamental bridges or fences, but the
expenditure of money for these purposes is considered justifiable. The
improvement of our highways should be looked upon as a benefit to all
the people in the same sense as any other improvement. The people are
taxed to improve our waterways; this does not benefit all the people
individually, some are detrimentally affected, but all have to help pay the
taxes. The Panama canal, to many who would help subscribe to build it,
would be a .positive financial disadvantage. But this does not argue against
the wisdom and justice of building it, if it will accrue to the benefit of
the country at large.
We are taxed to pay for forest preserves, public parks, game pre-
serves, and a thousand and one things which inadvertently increase the
wealth of a few individuals at the cost of many who derive no benefit from
the outlay, and a few who experience a real loss, yet it has been proved
by long experience that this is just.
In the early days of the Erie canal and other canal projects, the
opposition to Government assistance to such schemes, which were said to
help one individual at the expense of another, was very bitter, but it has
proved to be the proper method.
In considering the question of good roads, it will be found that by
the method of general taxation the resident in the small town, who has
no horses or bicycles, will be taxed to maintain a luxury for his more


fortunate neighbor to enjoy, while he enjoys no direct benefit whatever
from the expenditure. The quarryman owning a quarry a few miles out
of town will pay no more tax, and will save many times the amount of his
tax every year. The man who owns a wood ranch among the mountains,
and who benefits only by one mile of good road in the ten he lives from
town, although he has no driving team and light wagon, pays his share of
the taxes and derives no actual benefit, while the well-to-do farmer living
on the line of the turnpike enjoys many pleasant drives over the road,
and pays but a trifle more tax in proportion.
This is true of equalization the world over. We pay thousands of
dollars a year to fire sunrise guns, to dress our soldiers handsomely, to fly

These expenditures may not directly benefit the Idaho mine owner or the
Texas stock man, but he should not begrudge his share of the expense.
The farmer is caricatured as the very incarnation of abject ignorance
and deplorable short-sightedness, and in respect to his business transac-
tions, when coping with sharp and unscrupulous business men, he often
shows that his lack of experience in the great bustle of business leaves
him at a great disadvantage, but when it comes to questions of justice and
equity, where quiet and extended considerations are indispensible to a
rightful decision, the ideas of the intelligent farmer have in the past, and
will in the future, be found to be ideas worthy of careful consideration.
Some of the Eastern States have begun to encourage the building of
good roads by giving State aid, and the results are quite satisfactory. In
these cases the adjoining land owners who will be most benefitted are
required to pay a small percentage of the cost.
Whatever method is adopted, the burden of the expense should be
borne by the general public, and not by the individual who makes most
use of the road.


THE MANUFACTURE OF PORTLAND CEMENT.
BY R. C. CARPENTER, 75, PROFESSOR OF EXPERIMENTAL ENGINEERING AT
CORNELL UNIVERSITY.

The growth of the industry of Portland cement manufacture has been
exceedingly rapid in this country since 1893, but previous to that time very
little Portland cement was manufactured here. During 1902 over 17,000,-
OOO barrels of cement were made in this country, and it is quite probable
that the reports of 1903, when completed, will show that something like
20,000,000 barrels were made. .^^^^L.
The process in this country has been developed on American lines
distinct and superior to those in use in Europe. These methods, although
requiring time for development, have enabled the American manufacturers
to produce an article superior In quality and at lower first cost than that
produced in any other part of the world.
^^^ MATERIALS REQUi:
Portland cenfkit is&lt;iw*jrtincial product pre(tlii$£d by%aixing together
in proper proportion calcareous and silicious material*, which are burned
when in a powdereAconditifU at an exceedingly high temkrature, pro-
ducing as a product a clinker which, when ground to a powdei»eonstitutes
Portland cement. The resulting material is a chemical combination of
lime, silica and alumina, &lt;trhich material is ^dom or n^^^tounav nature
mixed in proper proportion for Portland cement. For that ivason il is
necessary to use raw materials, some of which contain an excess of lime
and others an excess of silicjL anct.mix these materials in/SKh a rrrajftner
as to give the desired proportion. The raw material ordinarily employed
in this country is some form akcarboKaJ* of lime, as limestone or ma'
which is mixed with some form of conibiued silica, as shale or clay.
else, as in the Lehigh Valley region, a calcareous slate or shale is rhixe
with an additional amount of limestone or pure shale, as required to give
the desired composition. It is corMidered dpsirable to have materials
which are low in magnesia, although it is not at the present time definitely
settled what amount of magnesia might \\- used without producing harm-
ful results. Portland cement has also been nfifijji'rfrom the carbonate of
lime rejected in the manufacture of soda as\, mixed with a proper amount"
of clay; it has also been made from blast ftenace^sJag by the mixture at ■■
the proper amount of lime. In all cases theVesuTtinjgcement has essen-^
tially the same composition, provided it is of good quality. The relation
of the lime to the silicates in a finished Portland cerftijiipwas determit;
by the French chemist Le Chatelier, in 1887, to li
by the following equations:
CaO + MgO &gt;
SiO, + AUO» =3
SiO,-(AU)t + Fe,Ot) &gt;
CaO + MgO = 3
ed
s
ve
lis


The German chemist Michaelis has shown that the relation of the
silicates to the lime in a Portland cement is essentially as expressed in
the equation
SiO, + AW, + Fe,0,
cm =25
Professor Spencer B. Newbury, formerly connected with the Chemical
Department of Cornell University, has shown by an extended investigation
that the maximum amount of lime which could be used in Portland cement
is expressed by the formula
CaO = 2.8 SiO, + i.i {AW, + Fe,0.).
The Newbury formula is the most convenient for use and is the one
ordinarily employed by American chemists in determining the proportion
of lime and silicates; in practical operations the amount of lime is usually
taken as about 10 per cent less than the maximum as shown in Newbury's
formula.
These preliminary remarks are sufficient to show that the art of
making Portland cement depends for its success on the correct proportion
of various ingredients, the amount of which must be determined by chem-
ical analyses and the proportion kept uniform by chemical determinations
from time to time. In other words, the art represents a combination of
chemical investigation with mechanical engineering, and while the
materials employed and the processes used are entirely different it is in
the respect mentioned similar to the steel industry.
There is also a slag or Puzzolan cement made by mixing and grind-
ing lime with blast furnace slag without calcining; this is not a Portland
cement, and is decidedly inferior in every respect.
THE PREPARATION OF THE RAW MATERIALS.
The preparation of raw materials will depend very largely upon their
nature. About 90 per cent of the cement manufactured in this country
is made from a rock which exists as a calciferous slate, to which is added,
as required, limestone or shale. When the raw material is in the form of
rock, the processes required are, first, quarrying or mining, which is con-
ducted on an extensive scale in many of the works and in which the most
improved machinery and processes are employed. In the process of quar-
rying rock drills are used for making holes, which are charged with dyna-
mite and fired, no attempt being made to prevent shattering of the rock.
The rock is then loaded into cars, either by hand or with a steam shovel,
and transported to the works. The rock, upon reaching the works, is
usually dosed with the proper amount of the desired material to make the
right chemical composition, and then sent to a large crusher, where it is
reduced to pieces from 2 to 2J/i inches in size. The dosing is in some of
the works done at a later stage of the process, the best time for the dosing
depending upon the materials; as a rule the materials to be mixed should
have about the same size, in order to produce uniform cement; if some
of the material is obtained in a fine condition, the dosing operation is
usually postponed until a portion of the grinding has been done.
The crushers which arc almost invariably employed in this work are
of the rotary gyratory form, as shown in Fig. 1, which type of crusher
was developed by the Gates Iron Works but is now made and sold by


41
several firms. The power required, with rocks of usual hardness, is about
one and one-tenth horse-power per ton of rock crushed per hour. The
jaw crusher, as shown in Fig. 2, which was developed by William Blake
and is known as the Blake or jaw crusher, is used by a few factories, but
is not as a rule considered as desirable as the rotary gyratory crusher. One
jaw in the Blake crusher has an oscillating motion in one plane; in the
Gates crusher the crushing head revolves, and also has a swinging motion
produced by an eccentric sleeve attached near the bottom.

FIG. I—ROTARY GYRATORY CRUSHER.
FIG. 2—JAW CRUSHER.
The material, after passing the crusher, has next to be dried. A num-
ber of forms of driers have been developed for this work, some of which
are patented. The driers usually employed are not patented and are
generally revolving cylinders 40 to 60 feet in length, supported on steel
tires which rest on heavy friction rolls. They are rotated when in use at
a speed approximating two revolutions per minute. They are usually set
with an inclination not greatly differing from one-half inch per foot. In
driers of recent construction, partitions dividing the drier into four com-
partments are usually inserted, while small channels and Z-bars are
employed to lift the material and present it to the heated gases. The
furnaces for warming the entering air are usually placed at the lower end
when the drier is used for stone or non-combustible material; but for coal
the furnace is usually arranged underneath the shell of the drier and the
discharge heat is passed in some cases through the drier and in others
discharged directly into the stack. Fig. 3 shows a design of drier which
the author has found very efficient for stone or clay.
The use of the waste heat discharged from the kilns for drying
surfaces has been in a number of cases suggested and in a few instances
applied in practice. The difficulty of arranging the driers in a plant in a
position for convenient operation with the waste heat from the kilns, and
the fact that a very small amount of fuel is required to dry material when
in the form of rocks, has generally led to the abandonment of all such
schemes as being more expensive in installation and operation than the


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC.
small saving made would warrant. In general, the materials must be
broken up moderately fine in order to obtain a good efficiency for the
driers. The total coal consumed in the driers in the rock plants under
normal conditions does not usually exceed, for all the materials and the
coal, ten pounds per barrel.
The material, after being crushed and dried, must be reduced to a
powder before burning; if the material is a mixture of very nearly pure
limestone rock, with shale or clay, the powder should be ground so that
about 96 per cent will pass through a standard mesh sieve of 100 to the

linear inch; if, however, the material is a calcareous slate and naturally
pretty well mixed, the raw grinding may be much coarser, probably as
coarse as 80 per cent through a standard 100-mesh sieve in extreme
conditions.
There is a large variety of grinding machinery in use, and considerable
time would be needed for a full description. The two types of machine in
use at the present time can be defined as rotary attrition mills, of which
the ball and tube mill is the common type, and as percussion mills, of which
mills with one or more swinging hammers or pendulums, as the Griffin
and Huntington mills are types. The ball and tube mills are of European

origin, and many are still imported into this country from Europe, but
they are also built by a number of concerns in America. The ball mill,
which is shown in section in Fig. 4, and in perspective in Fig. 5, as built
by the Gates Co., is a short cylinder having heavy perforated steel plates
located inside of screens near the outside periphery; it is loaded with
extremely hard steel balls varying in diameter from 3 to 5 inches, as
shown. The rotation of this cylinder causes the heavy balls and other
contents to fall with considerable force upon any pieces of rock in the
mill, which are thereby reduced so as to pass through the perforated plates
and the screen. The ball mill is not suited for fine grinding, but it is
admirably adapted for reducing the material from the size of 2^4 inches
to a size that will pass through a 20-mesh sieve. The product is then fed
to the tube mill, where it is ground to a fine powder.

FIG. 7—GRIFFIN MIU.
The tube mill, shown in perspective in Fig. 6, is a cylinder with suitable
rotating machinery, usually 22 feet in length and about 52 inches in
diameter, lined with an exceedingly hard material, usually hard quartz
or steel. It is supplied with a charge of flint pebbles imported for the
purpose, ranging in size from 2^ to il/2 inches, and is made to revolve at
the rate of about 25 revolutions per minute. The material supplied,
already coarsely ground, is reduced to a powder by the rolling and rubbing
action of the pebbles in the mill, caused by the rotation. This mill has no
screens, so the fineness of grinding depends upon the rate of feed, the
material being discharged through slots in the back head near the peri-
phery and elevated into a convenient receptacle for carrying the ground
material away. Both ball and tube mills need quite elaborate feeding
mechanism, in order to supply the material uniformly and at any desired
rate. The feeding mechanism used by the Allis-Chalmers Co. is shown in
accompanying illustrations of ball and tube mills.
The Griffin mill, which is shown in perspective in Fig. 7, is of Amer-
ican invention, and is used extensively in the cement industry. In prin-


ciple the mill is a revolving pendulum, which carries at its lower end a
ball or bob which strikes in its rotation on the inner side of a steel ring,
the grinding being produced partly by the blow of the pendulum and
partly by the rubbing action caused by its peculiar motion. The mill
is supplied with screens above the grinding ring. The lower part of the
bob carries plows, or feet, which thrown any material from the bottom up
into the grinding zone or higher. The shaft supporting the bob is supplied
with wings, which produce a draft, tending to drive the material out
through the screens. This mill is a very efficient grinding machine when
the material supplied is reduced to the proper size. Experience proves that
the material should be less than one-half inch in size in order to get good
efficiency with a low cost of repairs in this mill. As the crushers usually
deliver rock broken to 2^2 or 3 inches only, some form of intermediate
breaker is required between the crusher and the Griffin mill, if it is used
on the raw or rock side. Various machines have been used for this inter-
mediate reduction, but the most satisfactory are probably small gyratory
crushers followed by narrow face rolls.
The Huntington mill, with various modifications, has been used to
some extent in this industry, but it has generally proved unsatisfactory
on account of the extremely high cost of repairs. The mill consists of
three pendulums suspended from a cross-head, the bobs or balls of which
rub on the interior of an iron ring during the revolution, of similar con-
struction to that in the Griffin mill, and this produces the required fineness
of the material. While the motions of the grinding ball are different, the
results produced are in many respects similar to the Griffin mill.
After the material is ground to a powder it is carried by conveying
machinery to suitable bins, from which it is fed by rather elaborately
arranged feeding mechanism into the rotary kiln.
The process described above is that which is employed in nearly all
of the rock mills in this country. In at least two of our large cement
mills the raw materials are ground in a wet and plastic state, and are fed
to the kilns in the form of a slurry containing about 40 per cent water.
The slurry process requires much more fuel for burning, and also reduces
the capacity of a kiln, so it is not likely to be continued where the raw
materials are obtained reasonably dry, for experience has shown that the
quality of the cement is no better with the wet than with the dry process,
while the expense of manufacture is greater. As illustrating the change
of opinion, the Alpena mill in Michigan, which manufactures cement from
rock, was built as a wet or slurry mill, but has recently changed to a dry
process mill, substantially as described above.
Where marl is employed as the principal raw material, it is usually
found in either a swamp or lake, and can usually be mined in the cheapest
manner by the use of a clam shell or dipper dredge. It may be removed
to the plant either by cars or by a pumping line, in which compressed air
is the medium employed for pumping. The marl, as it exists naturally,
contains a large amount of water, which usually ranges between 60 and 80
per cent of the total amount, or from 1.5 to 4 times that of the dried
material. When we" consider the fact that about 450 pounds of dry car-
bonate of lime is required for each barrel of cement, these figures indicate
that from 675 to 1,800 pounds of water must be removed from the raw
product for each barrel of cement. At the present time no mechanical
method for removing this water has been devised, and after numerous
experiments, on a small scale, I feel convinced that no mechanical method
is possible because of the intimate union of the water with the organic


material of the marl. The only possible way to remove the water is by a
process of evaporation. If the plant is constructed so that pumping
processes are used for moving the material, additional water must be
added in order to reduce the consistency, which is the case in most marl
mills as run to-day. When it is considered that about the best evaporation
possible with the coal usually supplied is about eight pounds of water to
one of coal, an extra amount is required over that needed in the dry
process, which varies from about ioo pounds as a minimum to 250 pounds
per barrel. If coal is not too expensive the extra expenditure for fuel may
be offset by possible economies in labor and power.
In the marl processes the grinding operations are comparatively simple
and are performed at a slight expense. Clay is usually mixed with the
marl and is usually dried before being mixed by a dryer similer to that
already described. It is mixed by weight with the proper amount of
marl, a chemist being employed to supervise this operation. It then passes
through a mixing process and is then fed to the grinding machinery, which
may be in the form of tube mills, or in some cases in the form of mill
stones mounted on a vertical axis. The material is ground wet, making
an exceedingly fine slurry; it is then passed to a storage tank, where it
is kept thoroughly mixed by a mechanical agitator or by an occasional
charge of compressed air from an air compressor. From this slurry tank
it is fed to the kilns. In the latest improved cement mills the material
is handled entirely by conveyors, no pumps being used. This plan does
away with the necessity of adding extra water, and by so doing produces
a marked economy in the consumption of fuel. Actual experience shows
that a properly designed screw conveyor will move wet material no matter
how sticky or adhesive it may be.
With the marl process, wet material is fed to the kilns. In the Great
Northern Portland Cement Co., which the writer designed, the kilns are
divided into two parts, each 60 feet in length, the upper part being called
the drier, it being arranged to receive all of the waste heat from the kilns,
from the boilers, and also some additional heat from its own furnace. The
material is first fed into the drier; it is then discharged into the kiln
with a good portion of the water removed, where it is burned in the
ordinary way. This system has proved very economical and satisfactory.
GRINDING THE CEMENT.
For the grinding of clinker the same mills are employed as previously
described for the grinding of rock. The clinker is a granular crystalline
substance rather easily broken to pieces, but extremely difficult to grind.
The resultant powder which constitutes the cement possesses great attrition
power, and as a consequence all the material used for grinding or handling
the clinker is subject to extreme wear, and must on that account be made
exceedingly heavy and strong. The Griffin mill is at the present time the
favorite mill for grinding clinker, and is used in the greater portion of
the mills for such a purpose. The ball and tube mill is, however, employed
in a number of mills, and is regarded by those who use it as a very satis-
factory grinding mill.
The repairs required to keep cement machinery in working order are,
on account of the extremely heavy service, very great, and probably are not
equaled in that respect in any other industry. The repairs of the Griffin
mill usually equal one-third of its cost each year, and under unfavorable
conditions are considerably higher. Those of the ball and tube mill closely
approximate that of the Griffin, and possibly when the extra cost of power


is charged, even exceeds that of the Griffin. The cost of repairs and
renewals required to keep a mill in operation through a long period of
time frequently averages from 8 to 12 cents per barrel of finished cement.
METHODS OF BURNING.
In the European Portland cement manufactories the cement is burned
almost universally in a fixed kiln into which are fed the required amounts
of the dried raw material in the form of briquettes and the fuel required
for combustion; these kilns are usually continuous in their operation, the
burned material being taken out at the bottom as the raw material and
fuel are supplied at the top. The clinker which is removed from the bot-
tom is in part over-burned, in part under-burned, and in part in perfect
condition, and must be sorted before it is sent to the grinding mill. This
process of burning is very economical in the use of fuel for the reason

that the heat of the burned clinker is employed to warm the air drawn
in for combustion, and the heat of the escaping gases is taken up in warm-
ing the raw material which is gradually moving to the point of incineration,
but it, however, requires a great deal of labor for the supply of raw
material and in sorting and handling the different grades of clinker pro-
duced. For that reason this process is especially adapted to a country like
Germany, where fuel costs are high and labor costs are cheap.
Although the Portland cement industry did not get on to a commercial
basis in the United States until 1893, the fixed kiln commonly used in
European countries was never employed to any great extent, and at the
present time is not used in more than three or four factories in the entire
country. The kiln which is generally employed is known as the rotary kiln.
(Fig. 10). It is of cylindrical form from 6 to 8 feet in diameter and from 60


47
to 80 feet in length; it is supported on rollers and made to slowly revolve.
This kiln was invented by F. Ransom in 1873*, an Englishman, but was
never a commercial success in England. It cannot be considered as a com-
mercial success in this country previous to 1893, and was a failure until
after a large number of experiments had been made which gradually led
to the knowledge of correct proportions and proper devices for combustion
of fuel. In the Ransom kiln it was proposed to use producer gas and also
powdered coal as fuel, which was to be delivered into the kiln by a blast of
air. The rotary kiln was, however, developed to a commercial success in
this country by use of crude oil as a fuel; in view of the extreme difficulties
which were experienced in perfecting the methods of burning powdered
coal, it is rather doubtful if the rotary kiln could have been perfected had
not oil been available as a fuel. The growing scarcity and high price of
oil led to its abandonment as a fuel about four years ago and made it
necessary to employ some substitute. Producer gas has been tried, but

great difficulty was experienced in producing a temperature high enough
to burn Portland cement; it is also subject to a considerable loss of com-
bustible material in the process of manufacture, and as a consequence is
not an efficient fuel. The temperature required for the necessary chemical
combinations in the manufacture of Portland cement is probably not less
than 28000 P.. and is 500 or 600 degrees higher than that required in the
open hearth furnace in the manufacture of steel, and without a regener-
ative process probably cannot be reached with producer gas.
It has been amply proved by experience that a good bituminous coal,
dried and ground to a powder so that 96 per cent will pass a standard
mesh sieve containing 10,000 meshes per square inch, can be fed into a
rotary kiln so as to produce practically perfect combustion and give a
temperature of from 2800 to 3000 degrees, and a process of burning pow-
dered coal is now almost universally adopted in the cement industry in this
country. The limits of this article do not permit any detail description
of the coal burning apparatus, which in general consists of a nozzle or
injector through which is forced a current of air under more or less pres-

sure, so as to impinge on a stream of coal dust, mix with it, and carry if
into the furnace where it is consumed. In this process the blower or com-
pressor usually supplies only a small portion of the air required for com-
bustion; the other part being drawn into the lower part of the kiln by the
draft of the chimney or by an induced action of the jet from the blower
or compressor. Usually one burner is employed for each kiln, but in
recent plants constructed by the author, two burners have been installed,
one or both of which can be used as desired.
On account of the extreme high temperatures necessary in the kiln, it
requires a lining of extremely refractory fire brick which is usually from
9 to 12 inches in thickness; the brick which has proved most successful
in this use contains a large amount of alumina and a relatively small
amount of silica.
In the process of burning with the rotary kiln, the raw material is fed
into the upper end, mixed in the proper proportions, usually in the form
of a dry powder, but in some cases when rock is used, and in all cases
when marl is used in the form of a thin paste. The powder or paste
should be ground so that fully 95 per cent should pass a standard sieve
with 100 meshes to the linear inch in order to secure perfect chemical com-
bination and thoroughly good cement.
The kilns at the present time are usually constructed of steel sheets
from 1/2 to 9/16 inches in thickness, which are rivetted together with single
strap butt joints, since these joints have been found to resist expansion
strains better than lap joints. The kiln is supported on two or three tires
made of rolled steel, and similar to those used on locomotive drivers, the
section of these tires varies from 6"x4" in the smaller kilns to 8"x6" in the
larger kilns (see Figs. 10 and 11). The tires are supported externally by
heavy friction rollers made of cast-steel. The driving mechanism consists
of a large girth gear located in a convenient position on the kiln, and a
train of gears sufficient to reduce the speed from about 200 to one. The
kiln is lined inside with fire brick varying in thickness from 9 to 12 inches
at the lower end, to from 4 to 6 inches at the upper end. At the lower
end a stationary or movable hood into which the kiln projects is employed,
and forms a shield to protect the burner and to regulate the admission of
air to the kiln. It also supports nozzles for supplying the fuel required
in combustion. In the lower part of the hood is an opening through which
the hot clinker falls out and air for combustion flows in. At the upper
end the kiln usually projects into a fixed hood of brick-work, which is
arranged to receive the discharge gases, and also provided with means
for cleaning; it also affords room for the feeding of the raw material.
The general arrangement of raw material bins and the feeding mechanism
for supplying the kilns are shown in Fig. 12. The kilns are set on an
inclination, which for dry material is usually Y\ inch to the foot; for wet
material it is less, and usually approximates Yi inch to the foot. The
kilns are rotated in different works at different speeds, and at the present
time there seems to be no rational explanation for the speed used. In the
dry process the speed of the kiln averages about one turn in three minutes,
but in some works the speed is one-third faster, and in others that much
slower. In the marl factories the speed is sometimes as great as one turn
per minute. The mechanism for supplying the raw material is usually
connected to the kiln, but in some cases is independently variable; the
mechanism for feeding the powdered coal is, I believe, in all cases capable
of regulation by the burner. The speed of the kiln is usually fixed, but in
some instances may be regulated by the burner. At the present time I am

of the opinion that best results are obtained by operating the kiln at a
fixed rate and providing regulating means for both the feed of the raw
material and the coal.
In the works built by Thomas A. Edison at Stewartsville, N. J., a
kiln built of cast-iron 9 feet in diameter and 150 feet in length has been
employed. This kiln has been operated only a few months, but the results
obtained show a large increase in quantity over that from the usual kiln.
The output of the kilns varies principally with the amount of moisture
and the mechanical condition of the raw material, as well as with the
proportions and dimensions. The kiln principally used in burning dry
material is 7 feet in diameter at the lower end, 5 feet 6 inches in diameter
at the upper end, with a length of 60 feet. This kiln with dry material,
and under usual and average conditions, burns -slightly over 200 barrels per
day, although in several instances where the draft conditions have been
favorable it has been made to produce over 300 barrels per day. A recent
improvement has been made which consists in lengthening the kiln to 80
feet, the results being an increase in quantity amounting to about one third,
so that the production in the dry process with kilns 60 feet in length can
be said to average 200 barrels per day, and those 80 feet in length can be
said to average 300 barrels per day. It seems quite probable that the
capacity per kiln will be increased to fully 500 barrels per day within the
near future. When the material contains a considerable amount of water
the production is lessened just about in proportion to the heat required to
remove the water. When wet material is used the results have also been
improved by increasing the length of the kiln, which permits utilization
in a greater degree heat which would otherwise be wasted. In the Great
Northern Portland Cement Co. the writer has used the equivalent of a
kiln 120 feet in length, the upper 60 foot portion being for mechanical rea-
sons separated from the lower part, and arranged so that it could receive
the waste heat from the boilers and from an additional fire underneath the
drier when desired. The results showed a decided increase in quantity
and an improvement in economy, as compared with those usually obtained
in burning materials containing the same amount of water.
HEAT DISTRIBUTION IN THE ROTARY KILN.
The heat which is obtained from the combustion of the fuel is utilized,
first, in warming the raw materials up to the temperature required for
chemical combination; second, in driving off the carbonic acid from the
raw material; third, in assisting in the chemical combination which is gen-
erally of such a nature as to increase rather than diminish the amount of
heat; fourth, in warming the air which enters the kiln for assisting in
combustion. The heat is wasted by that discharged from the stack in
excess of that required for draft, and second, in that discharged with the
clinker at the lower end of the kiln, and third by radiation. Dr. Joseph W.
Richards obtained from a test of a kiln in the Dexter Works at Nazareth
the following results for the distribution of heat:
15-3 % received from chemical actions.
36 % was carried off by excess air in chimney gases.
36.1 % was carried off by necessary products of combustion.
10.7 % was carried off by hot clinker.
.02% was carried off by flue dust.
12.8 % was carried off by radiation and conduction.
(See Engineering Record, Feb. 27, 1904).


This test indicates a flue loss of about 72 per cent of the total heat
supplied.
COAL CONSUMED.
The heat necessary for the burning of cement is much less than that
which has to be supplied because of the inevitable wastes, to which refer-
ence has been made. Actual experience shows that the amount of coal
used per barrel of 380 pounds is approximately as follows, with the differ-
ent forms of kilns:
Intermittent fixed vertical kiln 76 to 95 pounds
Continuous fixed vertical kiln 42 to 46 pounds
Rotary kilns, dry process 85 to no pounds
Rotary kilns, wet process 160 to 250 pounds
THEORETICAL COAL CONSUMPTION DUE TO HEAT IN DISCHARGE GASES.
If we assume as representing average conditions that a barrel of
cement requires 600 pounds of nearly dry raw material, of which 450
pounds is the carbonate of lime, the heat required to decompose this will
be 450 X 765 = 344,250 B.T.U. If 6 pounds of sulphuric anhydride be
liberated, heat will be required equal to 6 X 1890= 11,340 B.T.U. The heat
of combination of ingredients formed in the clinker is approximately
380 X 78.6 = 29,868 B.T.U. per barrel* The total heat needed per barrel of
cement would by this calculation equal 325,722 B.T.U. If the coal be
assumed to give off 13,800 B.T.U. per pound and the surrounding air be
taken at 60 degrees, the theoretical air for combustion at 10.2 pounds per
pound of coal, we should have as the available heat per pound of coal
burned the following amounts, after deducting losses due to escaping
gases at the flue temperatures given.

DESIGN AND TEST OF A BOILER PLANT FOR UTILIZING DISCHARGE GASES FROM A
ROTARY KILN.
On account of the large flue loss at an exceedingly high temperature,
the author was led some six or seven years ago to consider methods of
making use of the waste heat without detracting from the capacity or effi-
ciency of the manufacturing of cement. The first consideration was the
use of an economizer which should be located in the waste gases and em-
ployed to warm the feed water for the boilers, but a series of experiments
soon indicated that the amount of heat which could be utilized in the feed
water was such a small portion of that going to waste that such a construc-
tion would be of little commercial value. About four years ago data was
obtained which led the author to believe that a fair portion of the steam
required in a steam plant could be produced by a properly designed steam
boiler, located in such manner that the discharge gases from the kiln could
be brought in contact with the heating surfaces without affecting the draft
of the kilns. For economic reasons it was also considered desirable to
have the boilers arranged so that additional fuel could be burned to supply
any deficiency of heat needed to operate the boiler to full capacity. It
was also thought desirable to install an economizer so as to receive the
heat from the waste gases of the boiler and warm up the feed water as
much as possible. The discharge gases from the kiln being loaded with
COi would not be of such nature as to support combustion, consequently
this construction would require the use of an external fire box located in
such a position that the auxiliary combustion could be perfected where the
burning fuel would not come in contact with the flue gases. There is
considerable dust carried over with the escaping gases from the kiln, and
the construction provided means for removing this dust from the heating
surface and preventing its accumulation in the boiler.
A system designed on these general lines was installed in the works
of the Cayuga Lake Cement Co., and has been in operation about two
years. The works referred to have a small plant consisting of four kilns
and grinding machinery sufficient for about 600 barrels per day, which is
located on the shores of Cayuga Lake, about six miles north of Ithaca, N.
Y. In this plant one boiler, of the vertical water-tube type, as built by the
Wickes Bros. Mfg. Co., and of 3000 sq. feet of water heating surface, was
installed for each two kilns of the plant. After two kilns, composing one-
half of the plant, had been in operation about two months, a test was made
to determine the economy of the plant and also the amount of steam
obtained from the waste gases. The test was in charge of J. W. Prince,
an experienced mechanical engineer, who had formerly been superintendent
of the Glens Falls Portland Cement Co., and is now superintendent of the
Great Northern, assisted by Carr and Ives, graduating students, Sibley
College, Cornell University. At the time of the test two kilns only were
in operation and the waste heat from these kilns passed through one boiler;
the other boiler when used being fired by hand exclusively. The tests of
the two boilers were made on different days. The test showed that boiler
No. 1, which received the waste gases, developed 406.8 B.H.P., of which it
was calculated that 264 B.H.P. was produced by the waste heat from the
two kilns and the remainder from coal burned on the grate. When boiler
No. 2 was tested, boiler No. I received the heat from the waste gases of


two kilns and no heat from hand firing, and during this time a measure-
ment of the feed water indicated that the heat from the waste gases was
sufficient to produce 254 B.H.P., which roughly checks the preceding test.
The results of the tests of these two boilers are shown in the following
table:

DISTRIBUTION OF HEAT IN THE PROCESS OF BURNING IN THE ROTARY KILN.
The test described indicated a coal consumption of 1888 pounds of
coal for the two kilns per hour and a production of clinker of 8,018 pounds.
The entering air was warmed by the discharge clinker from the kiln to a
temperature of 480 degrees; that discharged from the kiln had a tem-
perature of nearly 1800 degrees. The temperature of the kiln, as measured
by the Noel optical pyrometer, varied from 23500 F. to 29600 F. Gases
leaving boiler 560° F., leaving economizer 350° F.
At the time of the test that portion of the air not supplied by the coal
feeding apparatus was forced by a special blower through the hot clinker
and thence into the kiln; by this regenerative action about 80 per cent, of
Ihe entering air was heated to 480° F., restoring to the two kilns about


2,000,000 B.T.U. per hour, or about 7 per cent of the heat produced by
the combustion of the coal. The regenerator while distinctly economical,
made the clinker elevators difficult to keep in order and tended to deliver
dust into the kiln room; it also took up valuable room and after a few
months of use was abandoned. The test shows, however, the value of
conserving the waste heat from the clinker by heating the entering air.
There is some loss due to the escape of dust into the flue, this loss is
believed to be about one-half of one per cent; in the apparatus as arranged
the greater portion of this dust was caught in the housing or chamber back
of the kiln, and was removed at intervals by hand and returned to the feed
boxes. A small portion, perhaps about ten per cent (4 lbs. per hour), was
carried by the gases onto the heating surfaces of the boiler, for which
reason it was necessary to blow off these surfaces with a jet of steam
once in about five hours. While no great difficulty has been experienced
from this cause, continued use has shown the possibility of improvement
in the construction and setting of the boiler so as to be more easily and
readily cleaned. This improved construction has been adopted in three
plants now being erected.
The temperature in the kiln when working under best conditions, and
determined by the Noel optical pyrometer, varied from 2250° F. near the
discharge end to 2950° F. about 20 feet from the lower end, to about 18000
F. at the upper end. The temperature in the burning zone seemed to
average about 2850° F., the temperature of the entire kiln on the inside
seem to average nearly 25000 F.
The following table of data and heat distribution is interesting, as
showing in an approximate way what portion of the heat is utilized and
what part wasted in the rotary kiln as operated under the conditions
described. Over Vi of the heat is discharged in the flue, 70 per cent of
which is utilized in steam, about J^th with the escaping clinker and about
l/l2th in radiation.

POWER REQUIRED FOR CEMENT PLANTS.
The total power required to operate the machinery of cement plants
averages very close to 1 H. P. for each barrel output per day when marl is
used, and 1.5 H.P. for each barrel of output per day when rock is used.
The power consumed in the various operations and by the various machines
is approximately as given in the following table, it being understood that
this quantity varies to a considerable extent so far as the grinding
machinery is concerned, with the character of the material, and with the
fineness of grinding. Raw material is usually ground so that 96 per cent
will pass a 100-mesh sieve when the materials are limestone and shale, so
that 90 per cent will pass a 100-mesh sieve when the materials are cement
rock. Finished cement is usually ground so that 95 per cent will pass a
100-mesh sieve and coal is ground so that 92 per cent will pass a 100-mesh
sieve.

LOCOMOTIVE ROAD TESTS.
J. C. THORPE, M. E.
As time goes on and the industries of our country are progressing
more and more along scientific lines, the officials of our railroads are
encouraging more and more the use of scientific methods—the methods
of the engineer—in dealing with the perplexing problems that are con-
stantly arising pertaining to their motive power. The application of the
indicator to the locomotive, in conjunction with the test of the evaporative
performance of the boiler, as a means of determining the engine perform-
ance, has attained great prominence during the last decade in railway
mechanical engineering. The investigations of the Mechanical Engineer
or the Engineer of Tests are depended upon as a means of determin-
ing just what shall be done to increase the efficiency of the railway's
locomotives and rolling stock. Upon these investigations are based
the decisions of the Superintendent of Motive Power or the Master
Mechanic to bore out or bush the cylinders of an engine; to apply a
wider fire-box to an engine, which, according to tests, gives evidence
of insufficient grate area; to change the arrangement of spark arrester and
diaphragm to produce a more efficient combustion, or make any of the
changes in the design or arrangement of parts that would seem to tend
toward greater efficiency, and again, it is by the carefully conducted indi-
cator tests of the engineer or the evaporative test of the boiler that the
effect of these changes is determined.
The time has not yet come when all of the railroads appreciate the
value of the mechanical engineer in surmounting the difficulties pertaining
to their motive power, but those roads that have given modern scientific
methods a fair, impartial trial have subsequently sacrificed other depart-
ments that the mechanical engineer's department should remain unim-
paired. It has been but a few years since one great western road paid out
$2,000 for a series of tests on a fast passenger locomotive of the Columbia
type that resulted in the engine being shopped and an entire new wide
fire-box being put on. The grate area was found entirely inadequate for
the efficient generation of steam. Similar instances might be cited from
the practice of many other roads, but this as an example is sufficient to
show how such work is increasing in favor among our motive power
officials.
Not long since the superintendent of one of our smaller roads, a pro-
gressive motive power official, decided to bore out the cylinder of one
of the smaller i6"x24" passenger engines with a view to increasing the
tractive effort, and thus placing the locomotive more nearly on an equal
footing with the larger engines in similar service. For, indeed, modern
passenger service demands that every locomotive pull every pound that is
in it, and we can not afford to have an engine running late into the ter-
minals if it is in our power to remedy the cause. Thus the conditions of
the service demand that every machine operate at its highest attainable
efficiency.
It was realized, of course, that there was a strong probability of the
locomotive being "over cylindered" and especially so, since it was of one of
the older patterns that were given scarcely enough heating surface for the
original diameter of cylinder. However, after conferences of the General
Superintendent with the Master Mechanic and Mechanical Engineer, the


decision was made to sacrifice economy of steam generation if the desired
additional tractive effort could be obtained, for it was very evident that
the 16" engine would be unable to take care of the "peak load" imposed
by the increased traffic of the mid-summer months.
It was this engine, after the cylinder had been bored to 17", that fur-
nished the subject for the test recorded herein. Before passing to a con-
sideration of the test itself, however, we will consider briefly the methods
employed and the manner of determining the results.
METHODS IN GENERAL.
Locomotive tests are divided into two general classes, shop and road
tests; the former pertaining more especially to efficiency tests, considering
the locomotive as a stationary power plant, and the latter to indicator tests
of the engines and tests of the boilers where they are influenced by the
conditions met with in actual practice. The road tests are made to better
advantage in conjunction with dynamometer car tests to determine the
actual draw bar pull of the engine; that is, the actual power available
at the draw bar for moving a train. A dynamometer car is not always
available and the draw bar pull is computed from the formula for tractive
effort, by introducing an efficiency constant that compensates for the losses
between the cylinder and the draw bar.
The matter of testing locomotives has been given considerable atten-
tion at various times by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers,
and a code of rules for conducting shop and road tests of locomotives
has been adopted by that society. This code appears in the Transactions
of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Vol. 15, page 1312.
The discussion given below will have to do with the A. S. M. E. code
for conducting locomotive road tests, somewhat modified to suit the con-
ditions of average practice, where a dynamometer car for determining
the draw bar pull is not available.
I. PREPARATIONS FOR TEST, AND LOCATION OF INSTRUMENTS.
The specific object of the test should be firmly fixed in mind, for upon
this item will depend to a considerable degree all the other items of
importance pertaining to the test, the method of computing and the inter-
pretation of results.
1. The locomotive should be put in good condition preparatory to
the test, unless, as is often the case, it is desirable to test the engine just
as it is found in the service before making the changes necessary to put
the machinery in the best possible condition. The boiler and tubes should
be tight and both interior and exterior surfaces should be clean and, if
possible, free from scale. There should be no lost motion in valve gear
and the valves should be carefully "run over" and adjusted by the shop
man usually in charge of that work. No change should be allowed during
the progress of the series of tests, unless for the purposes of the trial.
A glass water gauge should be attached to the boiler, if not already pro-
vided. A convenient but not essential feature is a rod attached to the
reverse lever, extending to the "front end," where it ends in a pointer
moving over a graduated scale, thus showing at a glance to the person
taking indicator diagrams the position of the reverse lever at the time of
taking "cards." The throttle-valve lever should also be provided with a
convenient scale for reading the degree of opening of the throttle.
2. The valves and pistons should be tested for leakage with the engine
at rest. This is done by the usual method of blocking the drivers and

setting the valves on center and then letting the engine take steam. The
leakage will show at the open cylinder cock or the smoke stack. The
steam line of the indicator diagram serves as a valuable check on the
condition of the valves and pistons as regards leakage.
3. A calibration of the tank is necessary not only for the convenience
of testing on the road but as a means of making corrections, as will

appear below. This is done by placing the tank, uncoupled from the
engine and filled with water, on the track scales. The level of water is
noted on a scale prepared for the purpose, and the weights are noted
as the water is let out of the tank one-half inch at a time. A calibration
curve should be plotted to facilitate interpolation.
4. The tank having been calibrated it is best to calibrate the water
gauge glass. This may easily be accomplished by closing all water outlets
and pumping water from the tank into the boiler, noting the amount


required to raise the level a stated distance. In this connection it is
important that the enginemens' personal "injector equation" be determined
for the purpose of making corrections for the overflow.
5. The quantities of steam consumed by the air pump, the blower
and the whistle under the ordinary service conditions should be accurately
determined for the purpose of making corrections when computing the
steam consumption of the engines. Corrections are obtained by noting the
amount the water level is lowered in the gauge glass when the auxiliary
apparatus is used, through a stated time, for example, one minute. Any
leakage of the boiler should be determined in a similar manner.
6. When possible and practicable a water meter should be attached
to the suction pipe of the injector, and located at a point where it can be
conveniently read by the observer stationed in the cab. It should be pro-
vided with a strainer and a check valve to prevent the entrance of foreign
matter from the tank or hot water from the boiler.
7. To facilitate the measurement of coal and the determination of the
amount used during any particular part of the run, it is best to provide
a sufficient number of sacks of ioo pounds capacity, the fuel to be weighed
into these preparatory to starting the test. A good method of determining
the coal used per run, where the intermediate intervals of time are of no
considerable importance, that is, when it is desired to know the amount
used from the beginning to the end of the test only, is as follows. Fill the
tender with coal, place enough on the deck to maintain the fire in good
condition until time for beginning the run. Place the tank on the track
scales and weigh, noting the amount of water in the tank. Repeat the
weighing and measurement of water at the end of the run, when the
amount of coal used will easily be determined.
8. For the safety of the observers and to facilitate the work of oper-
ating the indicators and taking the readings of instruments at the front
end, a housing, or "pilot box" should be built around the front end, resting
on the "pilot" beam and extending back so as to enclose the cylinders.
This housing is floored over and serves as a great convenience.
9. The indicator apparatus that is most satisfactory consists of a
three-way cock connecting the indicator pipes and some good suitable
form of reducing motion. The }£" indicator pipes should be connected
with the side of the cylinder, where the holes have been tapped into the
clearance space. On roads where indicator tests are frequently made all
engines whose cylinders are not tapped for the indicator pipes by the
builders are so prepared when they are first put in the shop for repairs.
After this is done the preliminary arrangements for the tests will occupy
but a very short time. Absolute rigidity of the indicator is essential for
accuracy and the indicator pipes and three way cocks should be firmly
secured. Obviously the reducing motion should be designed and attached
with the same object in view.
10. A draft gauge consisting of a U-tube containing water, with a
scale graduated in inches properly attached, should be connected to the
smoke box and attached to the side of the "pilot box."
11. A pyrometer for showing the temperature of the escaping gases
should be placed in the front end, extending horizontally across and about
four inches in front of the front tube sheet. A mechanical pyrometer with
very legible dial and scale graduated in degrees is preferable.
12. A good form of throttling calorimeter should be attached to the
steam dome as near the opening of the throttle valve as possible, for the
purpose of determining the dryness or quality of the steam furnished by
the boiler.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC.
13. A revolution counter with very legible figures should be placed
near the front end of the engine in plain view of one of the observers
taking the diagrams. When possible a tachometer should be used for this
purpose driven by a belt from a pulley on the driving axle. A very con-

venient arrangement for recording revolutions when a tachometer is not
available is to have a stroke counter placed on the end of the running
board, facing the cylinder, and operated by a light connecting rod from
the indicator reducing motion.
14. A stroke counter should be attached to record the strokes of the
air pump.
15. It is important that some positive signaling apparatus be used
to communicate between the observers in the pilot box and those in the
cab. An electric bell is a very convenient apparatus for this purpose, the
battery being placed in the pilot box.


16. In the matter of assistants, the one in charge of the test is best
able to judge the number necessary, the various duties of each man and
the manner of taking the record.
For making the test in accordance with the foregoing directions, four
(4) assistants are quite necessary, distributed and taking records, as fol-
lows:
Two (2) cab assistants, whose duty it shall be to note the reading of
the steam gauge, water meter, the position of reverse lever and throttle,
the height of the water in the tank, the height of water in the gauge glass,
the number of times and amount the whistle is blown, the length of time
the safety valve blows, the time the blower is used, the temperature of feed
water, the times the injector is "primed," the time of opening and closing
the throttle, the number of sacks of coal used, the reading of air pump
stroke counter, the readings of calorimeter, the time of each start and
stop, time of passing each station and mile post, time of taking each
indicator diagram.
Two (2) pilot box observers, stationed at the cylinders, who take the
indicator diagrams and record the R. P. M., readings of draft gauge and
pyrometer. These men should assist the observers in the cab when pos-
sible, to obtain the data necessary at the beginning and end of each run,
and offer what other assistance that will tend toward the success of the
test.
17. Blanks should be prepared for taking the records with the idea
of convenience being constantly in mind. A study of the profile of the
road should be made and a record made of the desirable places of obtaining
diagrams. These should be so arranged that the intervals between the
successive readings and diagrams should not exceed three (3) minutes.
18. It is of paramount importance after all preparatory work has
been accomplished, that the locomotive be subjected to a preliminary run
of sufficient duration to make a fair trial of the testing apparatus, and to
give the various assistants an opportunity to become familiar with their
duties.
19. All testing apparatus should be carefully calibrated, when admiss-
ible, by comparison with known standards. This is of exceedingly great
importance as results based upon the uncorrected readings from uncali-
brated instruments are not to be relied upon.
A TEST OF AN AMERICAN TYPE OF LOCOMOTIVE, ILLUSTRATING BRIEFLY THE

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC.
It was desired to know the performance of the locomotive as it was
in service at the time of the test. Accordingly plans were made to make
the test without any steps being taken to place the engine in the best
possible condition. This condition prevailed throughout the first two
tests recorded, but before the third test the valves were carefully "run
over" at the shop and some minor changes made in the front end arrange-

ment. She had come from the shops about three months before. The
flues had not been cleaned recently nor had the boiler been washed out.
Examination revealed the fact that a considerable number of the tubes
were plugged, thus reducing the heating surface, which had it been all
available, was 235 sq. ft. less than the standard design for 17" X 24"
engines. The front end was equipped with a poor modification of what
is known as the "Northwestern Self-Cleaning Front End." The diameter
of the exhaust nozzle was 4 inches.
In this condition, not at all favorable, the locomotive was subjected
to the test.


METHOD.
The engine was taken from the regular run and put in the repair shop,
where the work was done that was necessary for placing the testing
apparatus in the proper places. A Carpenter Improved Calorimeter was
placed near the top of the steam dome on the left side. A revolution
counter was placed on the end of the running board, the dial facing the
cylinder on the left side and operated by a small connecting rod from the
sector of the indicator reducing motion. On the right side were placed
a stroke counter on the air pump, a mechanical pyrometer for determining
the temperature of the flue gases. The draft gauge was omitted, as not
bearing sufficiently on the object of the test. In lieu of a water meter
being placed in the suction pipe of the injector, an accurate calibration of
the tank was made and the tank gauge used to measure the water passing
into the boiler. The notches on the reverse lever quadrant and on the
sector of the throttle lever were numbered and a string placed around the
water-guage glass. A signalling device was arranged with strings and
different colored targets for convenience in obtaining simultaneous readings.
With all the apparatus in place and in working order, as determined
by a trial trip, preparations were made for the first test run.
A short time before the train was due to start, the tender was loaded
with coal and water and the weight carefully noted. Enough coal was
placed on the deck to keep up a good fire until time for beginning the
test. Everything being in readiness, the water in the tank was measured,
the string adjusted to the level of the water in the gauge glass and the
condition of the fire carefully noted, when the run was begun. Readings
and indicator diagrams were taken in accordance with the schedule
arranged from a previous study of the road profile. At the end of the run
the fire and the water level were brought to the same conditions as when
the test was begun.

Tractive Effort.
It is very desirable that we know the draw-bar pull resulting from
any set of cylinder conditions, and in lieu of a Dynamometer Car this
result must be computed from some empirical formula, established from
results of tests made with the dynamometer in use. The formula used
in this instance is taken from Prof. Goss' article on "Some Factors Affect-
ing the Power of Locomotives," read before the New England Railway
Club, and is as follows:
T= (161 H/S) — (3.8dV£&gt;) —W (2 + 5/6) — (.11 5*)
where
T = Tractive effort available at draw-bar.
H = Heating surface in square foot.
5 = Speed in miles per hour.
d = Diameter of cylinder in inches.
D = Diameter of drivers in inches.
L = Length of stroke in feet.
W = Rolling load, excluding weight on the drivers.
161 H/S = Theoretical tractive effort.
3.8 &lt;Ph/D = Tractive power to overcome machine friction.
W (2 -j- S/6) = Tractive power to overcome resistance of rolling load.
.11 5? = Tractive power to overcome air resistance.
The average tractive effort would not mean much unless accompanied
by the results obtained from each card, and such a record is unnecessary
in this case. A print of the indicator cards showing the maximum, mini-
mum, and average indicated horse power for each trip is appended, show-
ing the tractive effort in addition to other data of importance, as well as
the print of the curve of tractive effort computed in accordance with the
foregoing formula.


GENERAL DISCUSSION.
No general discussion of results will be attempted at this time, but in
order that no misunderstanding may arise, it is desired to point out,
briefly, the conditions affecting the results in the foregoing table.
Trip No. 1 was made under the best of weather conditions, as were
all the other tests recorded, but with the advantage that the train left
the terminal on time and met with no delays during the trip. Thus the
engine was worked under normal conditions, no difficulty being experi-
enced in maintaining the speed required by the schedule.
Trip No. II. was begun with the train over twenty minutes late and
an exceedingly poor grade of coal on the tender. Furthermore, a number
of delays were experienced en route, thus necessitating the forcing of the
boiler throughout the entire trip. On this account the steam consumption
per I. H. P. hour obtained from Trip No. I., viz., 29.8 pounds, represents to
a fairer degree of accuracy the actual engine performance than does that
of the second trip.
Trip No. III. was begun under very normal conditions, and since the
engine had been in the shop, where the valves were carefully adjusted and
some other minor changes made tending toward greater efficiency, we had
a right to expect much more satisfactory results than were obtained on
the tests previously made. However, a number of delays were experienced,
and after fifty miles were run the train was more than one hour late. This,
of course, operated to the disadvantage of the engine performance, and the
results obtained were not as satisfactory as it was hoped they would be.
However, the improvement made in the steam distribution, as evidenced
by a comparison of the indicator diagrams; the decrease in the coal con-
sumption per sq. ft. of grate area per hour, and in the steam consumption
per I. H. P. hour, even under the most unfavorable conditions, show the
economy resulting from reasonable care of the locomotive's machinery.


THE VALUE OF GAS ANALYSIS IN GAS ENGINE
TESTS.
ALFRED H. WHITE, '93.
Any test of a gas engine which involves its thermal efficiency requires
an analysis of the waste gases and of the gas used as fuel. Granted that
these analyses are accurate, it is possible to calculate from them the rela-
tive amounts of air and gas used, the theoretical temperature of combus-
tion and, if the temperature of the exhaust gases be known, the loss of
heat in the waste gases.
The principle of such calculations has been known from the time of
the earliest experiments with the gas engine, but their value was discred-
ited because of the impossible values then obtained. All calculations of
temperature or loss of heat require the use of the specific heats of the
gases, and it was the defective knowledge of specific heats in the earlier
days which caused erroneous results. The specific heats of the products
of combustion as obtained by Regnault from his experiments at ordinary
temperatures gave preposterously high temperatures as theoretically
possible. In 1883 Mallard and Le Chatelier, by their classic researches
on the explosion of gases in closed vessels, obtained experimental data
on the specific heats of these combustion gases at higher temperatures,
and showed conclusively that the specific heats rise rapidly with increase
in temperature. The principle of this work has been confirmed by others,
although there is considerable divergence in the numerical results obtained
by different experimenters. In the absence of any authoritative revision
of their work, however, the Le Chatelier specific heats remain the stan-
dard. Unfortunately, the knowledge of them has remained almost exclu-
sively in the hands of those accustomed to using the metric units and to
reading French and German. So far as the author is aware, none of the
writers of text books on gas engines in the English language have ever
made use of anything but Regnault's data on specific heats.
In the hope of putting the information regarding specific heats in
more accessible form, they have been recalculated from the original and
generalized data of Le Chetalier and will be found as an appendix to the
paper. These tables have been previously published by the author in
Volume 20 of the Proceedings of the American Gas Light Association,
and are here reprinted by permission of the Association.
In illustrating the methods of calculation, the data from an actual
gas engine test will be used. The gas used in this test was an illuminating
gas, and the method of calculation can be applied without change to any
gas which does not carry much nitrogen. Where so-called "power" gases
are used, some of the short cuts must be omitted, but on the other hand
the simpler composition of the gas greatly facilitates the longer calculation.
CALCULATIONS FROM ANALYSIS OF WASTE GASES.
Composition by Analysis. COi 10.1%
O, 1.2%

N, 88.7%
100.0%


The composition of the air entering the engine is 20.9% oxygen and
79.1% nitrogen by volume. The volume of the nitrogen will not change
during combustion, and in the case of illuminating gas we may disregard
the volume of the nitrogen in the gas which will not introduce an error
of over one per cent. The volume of the carbon dioxide is the same as
that of the oxygen which formed it. The water formed by combustion
of the hydrogen and oxygen has condensed and does not appear in the
gas. The disappearance of this oxygen has caused the waste gases to
occupy a smaller volume, and has increased the percentage composition
of the other constituents proportionately. The first step in determining
the relative volume of the waste gases is to calculate the amount of oxygen
which has thus disappeared. It may be obtained by simple proportion. If
the nitrogen of the air, originally 79.1%, has now become 88.7%, it follows
that the carbon dioxide (which has the same volume as the oxygen which
formed it) and the free oxygen have been increased in the same ratio.
Reducing them to their initial volumes, we find that out of 100 volumes
of air there were
79.1 vols. N
20.9 vols. O of which 1.07 remained as free O
9.01 formed CO*
10.82 (by difference) formed HiO
20.9
This shows that out of 20.9 volumes of oxygen 1.07 escaped as free
oxygen and 19.83 were utilized. The excess of oxygen, and consequently
1.07
of air, was then or 54%. If the air used has been metered, it is
1983
now easy to calculate the theoretical volume of air necessary for complete
combustion, if such figure is desired. The volume of the smoke gases
may be obtained from the above table, showing the proportions of the
oxygen which formed carbon dioxide and water vapor. The combustible
constituents of the gas all burn to carbon dioxide (which occupies the
same volume as the oxygen which combined with it), or to water vapor
which has twice the volume of the oxygen before combustion. One
hundred volumes of air entering the engine will be changed as follows:

One hundred volumes of air, as metered, will make 110.8 volumes of
exit gases of the composition indicated, and from the experimentally
determined temperature and the specific heats the loss of heat may be
calculated, as indicated later. This calculation has not involved any
knowledge of the composition of the entering gas beyond the assumption
that it carried only small amounts of oxygen and nitrogen. It has, how-
ever, required the measurement of the air, which is rarely done. The

same results may be obtained without the measurement of the air if the
composition of the gas is known. This will now be considered.

The loss of heat in these gases may be obtained when the volume,
composition fit temperature are known. The latter should be measured
by some form of pyrometer. If the temperature in the present case is
7000 C. at atmospheric pressure, the method of calculation will be as
follows:
One cubic foot of gas produces 6.549 cubic feet of exit gas of the
composition given. The amount of heat lost with these gases is obtained
by multiplying the volume of each constituent by its mean specific heat at
700° (see Table III., which is expressed in small calories per litre).

CALCULATION OF THEORETICAL COMBUSTION TEMPERATURES.
There are many cases where it is desirable for the engineer to know
the maximum temperature which may be developed with gaseous fuels. In
controlling smelting furnaces of all kinds and in tests of gas engines such
information becomes of great importance. These temperatures may readily
be calculated if we know the composition of the fuel, the amount of air
used and the specific heats of the products of combustion.
In the calculation of theoretical temperatures we assume that com-
bustion is complete and instantaneous, that there is no dissociation of the
products of combustion, and that all of the heat produced is used in raising
the temperature of the gases remaining after combustion. For this cal-
culation we must know the amount of heat developed by the combustion of
a given quantity of gas, and the amount and specific heat of each constit-
uent in the products of combustion. It is customary to deal with volumes
and not with weights of gases, and on that account it is much more con-
venient to use specific heats by volume and not by weight. The use of
these volumetric specific heats also obviates largely the need of laborious
calculations from the metric to the English units.
As an instance of the method of calculating these temperatures we
may take so-called "blue" water gas, made by blowing steam through


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC.
white-hot coke, which will normally contain carbon dioxide, oxygen, car-
bon monoxide, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Knowing the composition of the
gas we may calculate from Table V. the volumes of the products of com-
bustion in the theoretical amount of air. We may also calculate from the
analysis or experimentally determine the heating value of the gas. In the
case of a simple gas, like that under discussion, the two methods of deter-
mining heating value will check closely, but in the case of complex gases
carrying unsaturated hydrocarbons the experimental method is much to
be preferred. In reporting the heating value of a gas, care should always
be taken to distinguish between the "gross" and "net" value; the former
being the result obtained in the calorimeter where the water formed in
combustion is condensed in the instrument to liquid water, and the latter
being a lower value calculated from the first where the water formed in
combustion is assumed to escape as steam at the boiling point of water.
It is evident that this "net" value represents most nearly actual conditions,
and is always to be used.
The following example gives the method of calculation for an actual
sample of unpurified blue water gas, combustion taking place at constant
pressure, that is, as if it were burned in the open air or in a furnace.

We see that one volume of this gas will give .523 volumes of water
vapor, and from Table III., that if we expect to raise one liter of water
vapor from zero Centigrade to 1850° that there will be required as the
mean value .581 calories for each degree. There will therefore be required
in this case a mean of .304 calories to raise the water vapor derived from


the combustion of one liter of this gas each degree from zero to 1850°.
Determining in the same way the heat required for the proper volumes of
carbon dioxide and nitrogen, we find that 1.334 calories will be the mean
amount of heat required to raise the total products of combustion each
degree from zero to 1850°. We have available to heat these gases 2474
calories, and theoretical temperature would therefore be 1854° C The
proper specific heat to be used (in this case for 1850°) may only be found
by trial.
Combustion in the theoretical amount of air is a condition never
attained in practice. There is most always an excess of air present, whose
amount may be calculated from the analysis of the gases after combustion.
Knowing this, we may calculate the highest temperature possible with our
given conditions. As an illustration, let us assume that when working
with this water gas we find the following as the analysis of the gases after
combustion:
Carbon dioxide 16.27%
Oxygen 4.15
Nitrogen 79-57
Each volume of this gas contains .415 volumes of oxygen which will be
accompanied by .415 X 3784:= .157 volumes of nitrogen from the air.
Deducting this amount plus the .02 volumes of nitrogen present in the
original gas from the total .796 volumes of nitrogen, we find .619 volumes
of nitrogen, corresponding to the oxygen actually used for combustion.
The .157 volumes therefore represent the excess of air and the .619 volumes
the air theoretically necessary. The ratio between these shows that there
was 25.4 per cent, excess of air present.
We may now calculate the maximum combustion temperature attain-
able under these conditions.

In the same way it may be calculated that for a fifty per cent, excess
of air the maximum temperature will be 14700 C = 26780 F.
In the preceding cases it has been assumed that the combustion took
place at constant pressure. In a gas engine, where the explosion takes
place approximately at constant volume, the theoretical temperature will
be somewhat higher, due to the lower specific heats. Referring to Table
I., where the volumetric specific heats at constant volume are given, we
may calculate
.523 + Sp. ht. H70 at 2100° (= .526) = .275
.454 4- Sp. ht. COi at 2100° (= .653) = .206

The temperature which may theoretically be obtained in a gas engine
is therefore with this gas nearly 300° C. higher than when burned in the
open air.
When considering the relations which these temperatures thus calcu-
lated bear to those actually obtained, we may take into account first the
influence of dissociation of the carbon dioxide and water vapor at high
temperatures. The extent of this dissociation has been summed up by
Nernst in his Theoretical Chemistry from Le Chatelier's work as follows:
"In the smelting furnace the temperature only extends to about
20000 C, and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide only amounts
to about 0.2 of an atmosphere; now the carbon dioxide is decom-
posed only to about five per cent., whereby the capacity of the
furnace for work is somewhat diminished, though not very much.
With explosives, the temperature of combustion rarely rises above
25000 C, and never reaches 3000°. Inasmuch as the pressure of
the carbon dioxide is here estimated in thousands of atmo-
spheres, dissociation has no influence."
It is not easy to assign any definite volume to the influence of the other
factors which prevent the attainment of the full theoretical temperature.
The heat liberated never goes completely to raising the temperature of
the combustion gases, but there are nearly always local points where the
heat is almost entirely utilized in this way. In the case of a Bunsen burner
flame the highest temperature found by the author experimentally was
1780° C, while the temperature calculated was 1850° C. Though the cal-
culated temperatures are always somewhat high, they afford valuable
information in controlling furnace work.
A few words of caution may not be out of place, regarding the care
which must be exercised in sampling and analyzing the gases upon whose
composition such important calculations are to be based. The gases should
be collected in a continuous sampler, which may conveniently be a gal-
vanized iron tank, holding about one cubic foot, coned at each end and
provided with stop cocks. Each tank is to be filled with water which has
been freshly saturated with gas similar to that to be tested. The different
solubilities of various gases in water makes this precaution absolutely
indispensable. Each tank may then be connected to the cock from which
the sample is to be drawn, using as little rubber tubing as possible in
making connections. In collecting the sample the water is allowed to run


from the sampling tank continuously, and at the end of a test a small
amount of this average sample is at once drawn off into a small laboratory
gas holder for analysis. Too much emphasis cannot be laid on the fact
that all rubber tubing and about all stop cocks allow slow leakage of gas.
The only gas holder in which it is safe to store gases over night is one
which allows both exits to be closed by water or mercury seals. The
same precautions with regard to saturating the water must be observed
in all gas holders and gas burettes. The portable Orsat apparatus so much
used by engineers will, with careful manipulation, give fairly accurate
results. It must be remembered, though, that alkaline pyrogallate gives
correct results for oxygen only when strong and freshly prepared, and that
cuprous chloride holds carbon monoxide very feebly, and should likewise
be fresh. Cuprous chloride also absorbs oxygen, and as in the Orsat
apparatus, it is impossible to bring all the gas in contact with the reagent,
it is very common to find a few tenths of a per cent of carbon monoxide
reported in presence of several per cent of oxygen. Such results may
almost certainly be discarded as erroneous.
APPENDIX—TABLES OF SPECIFIC HEATS.
The tables given below have been calculated from the original data
of Le Chatelier, to which references are given, and the method of calcula-
tion is indicated in every case. Specific heats by weight and by volume
both at constant volume and constant pressure are given for carbon dioxide,
water vapor, nitrogen, and oxygen for each ioo" Centigrade between ioo°
and 2500°. The inaccuracies of the experimental data on which the tables
are based renders it useless to attempt to interpolate in the tables more
closely than to fifty degrees.
CALCULATION OF SPECIFIC HEATS ACCORDING TO DATA OF LE CHATELIER.
Original References.
"If we represent by Cp and CV the molecular specific
heats, we have for all gases Cp = CV + 1.964" (Mallard
and LeChatelier, Annales des Mines, 1883 (2), 512.)
"The mean molecular specific heat at constant volume
equals:
CO., = 6.50 + .00387 /.
H^O vapor = 5.78 -f .00286 t.
Permanent gases = 4.76 + .00122 /.
The specific heats of gases are independent of pressure
even at pressures of six to seven thousand atmospheres,
and the specific heats of permanent gases are equal to one
another even at high pressures and temperatures." (Le
Chatelier Seanc. de Soc. de Phys., 1888, p. 308-327, from
an abstract in Wiedeman's Annalen der Physik, Beiblatter,
1890, Vol. 14, p. 364.)
For the calculation of temperatures of freely burning flames, the
specific heats at constant pressure must be used, which are obtained by
adding 1.064 to the molecular specific heats at constant volume.
COi = 8.464 + .00387 t.
H%0 vapor = 7.743 + .00286 /.
Permanent gases — 6.724 + .00122 /.
To obtain from these mean molecular specific heats the specific heats
for 1 gram., we must divide by the molecular weights of the gases in

As it is usually much more convenient to use the specific heats by
volume, these may be calculated by multiplying these figures by the weight
of a liter of the gas under standard conditions.

A BASE LINE MEASUREMENT.
A. H. BENNETT, 02.
This is a description of the method of measuring base line for the loca-
tion of the Pennsylvania Railroad tunnels under the North and East Rivers
and Manhattan Island, New York City. The method was designed partic-
ularly for measuring along the pavements and sidewalks of city streets,
where no stakes could be driven. It was also used on ordinary ground;
although in that case driven stakes took the place of the movable stations.
The apparatus consists essentially of a 100-foot steel tape graduated
to hundredths, an anchor post, a tension wheel and twelve-pound brass
weight, several movable stations, four standards for supporting the tape,
and four thermometers. These are shown in the illustrations. The
anchor post is an upright of wood about 4 feet high, fitted to a flat base.
A block, which can be pushed up and down the post to any desired posi-
tion, and secured by tightening a nut, carries a cord and hook for attach-
ing an end of the tape. Cords with tent rope adjustment, attached to top
and bottom, are thrown over a spike, when it is possible to drive one;
otherwise they are held by a man standing on them. The tension appar-
atus is a ball-bearing bicycle wheel attached to a heavy gas-pipe frame.
The rim is supplied with three grooves, which carry two cords to support
the weight, and one cord for attaching the tape. The manner of applying
the tension is easily seen in the second illustration—the tape cord passing
between the two weight cords. The frame is susceptible of various adjust-
ments. The elevation and level position are readily altered by means of
the three legs. The elevation of the wheel itself is also adjustable by
means of the tapped collar which directly supports the upright shaft. If
the tape is only a little out of line from the spider, it may be readily
adjusted by slightly tilting the wheel by means of one of the two forward
legs. By loosening the binding nut beneath, the castings may be shifted
longitudinally on the frame, this adjustment serving to give the weight
more or less cord, as may be necessary, and allowing the tape to be shifted
for position without lifting the frame. The weight of the frame and
wheel is about 150 pounds; but this is somewhat greater than is necessary
—it might be made of smaller pipe and the weight of the castings might
be reduced, and still leave a comfortable margin to prevent sliding on a
stone sidewalk or asphalt pavement. It should be noted, however, that
the tail-piece is a solid casting, and must be left heavy in order to prevent
the frame from being overturned about the front legs by the tension.
The movable station was soon nick-named, or really renamed, "the spider."
As seen in the picture, it is an iron tripod, carrying a center shaft with
a brass cap, which is rounded off to a radius of 15 inches. The legs are
screw-threaded, although the position of the spider can be so chosen as
to make adjustment seldom necessary. The weight is 75 pounds, most of
which is distributed in the solid iron ring. On the standard, the clamp
was rigged up by the aid of two small hinges and a pair of rubber bands.
The monuments were generally placed under the sidewalks at street
corners, near the curb. They were built by embedding a brass plug in
a block of concrete, set below the sidewalk level, the whole being covered


with a cast-iron box, whose cover lies flush with the walk, and is fastened
down by a screw-bolt.
The method of operation, briefly, is this. Spiders are set up at
intervals of about 99.5 feet, from one monument toward the other. The
tape is then set up over the first space, with the anchor post ahead and the
tension wheel behind. The distance between the monument and the cross
mark on the first spider is read; then the tape is moved forward and the
distance between the first and second spiders is read; and so on, until the
monument at the other end of the line is reached. When any spider has
been read upon by the head chainmen and by the rear chainmen, and the
tape moved up, the spider thus left can be taken up and moved forward,
ready to be used again. In this way no more than three spiders are essen-
tial, although one or two more are convenient. It is evident that as much
weight as can be handled by one man should be put into the spider, for
if the rear spider is disturbed before the rear chainmen finish reading on
it, and the one behind has been moved, it means start over again at the
monument. In all the work done, however, such a contingency arose but
once, and on one other occasion it was necessary to go back 100 feet.
Four spiders were used; two being read upon, one remaining 100 feet
back, and one being carried forward to the next station. As the work was
done at night, there was no danger of the one left behind being disturbed.
Previous to the actual measurement, a party went out with transit
and tape and marked off 99.5 foot spaces in line, scratching a mark on
the sidewalk or paving stones. This party was followed by levelers, who
took the elevations of the points.
THE MEASUREMENT.
The party was divided as follows: two head chainmen, two rear
chainmen, a transit man, a thermometer man, and a recorder. Arrived
upon the field, the first thing was to open the monument, set up the
transit near it approximately at right angles to the line, and set out
two or three spiders over the points previously located. The head chain-
men set up the anchor post so that two- or three-tenths of the last foot
on the tape would extend beyond the first spider. The rear chainmen set
up the tension wheel so as to bring the rear end of the tape vertically
over the monument. The thermometer man set up his standards at each
20-foot division and placed the tape in the hooks, which hung by cords.
A back-sight was given at one end of the tape, and the hooks were given
their elevations by a man sighting from the other end; so that the tape
was supported at six points in the same straight, but not necessarily
horizontal, line. The back-sight was a small, white-painted board, made
to set upon the spider, so that its lower edge was upon the tape. Light
was thrown upon it from an acetylene bicycle lamp; and the "thermometer
man," as I have called him, had an ordinary oil lantern fitted up with a
white-painted paddle projecting from it, and a shield to screen the direct
light from the observer. In tne first picture the back-sight is shown upon
one of the spiders; and in the second picture is shown the lantern, with
the back-sight lying near it. The thermometer man had merely to hold
the lantern so as to bring the upper edge of the paddle up to the tape
from beneath, and the observer thus had a ready means of accurately lining
up the tape. The height of the spider and the distance from the monu-
ment up to the tape were taken by a short graduated rod, so that the
slope of the tape could be determined from the level notes. The transit
having been leveled, a setting was made upon the monument, the telescope

was then raised to the tape, and the transit man was ready to take read-
ings on the rear end of the tape. All being ready, the rear man called out,
and both ends of the tape were read simultaneously, thousandths being
estimated. In this manner five to ten readings were taken, and after each
reading the tension wheel was given a slight impetus, alternately forward
and back, in order to disturb the tape and make the next reading an
independent observation, as well as to counteract to an extent the effect
of friction in the apparatus. Acetylene lamps were used to throw light
on the tape. While this was being done, the thermometer man had an
opportunity to read each thermometer at least once, and sometimes oftener.
The tape was then carried forward to the next space. The set up is
shown in the second picture, with only one spider and one standard, and
a short length of tape.
The primary reason for working at night was because the travel in
the streets during the day made measurement impossible; but another
decided advantage was also gained in that the temperature of the tape
was more nearly the temperature recorded by the thermometers, whereas
in the daytime the direct action of the sun and the reflected and radiated
heat from the pavements and walks would make the temperature of the
tape a very uncertain quantity.
Rapid progress was made along the smooth walks. Spiders were kept
set ahead, and, these being of the same height, no adjustments of anchor
post or tension wheel were necessary except to shift them into line, which
was very readily accomplished. No record was kept of the time con-
sumed, although it was unofficially noted that on one stretch of cement
walk, where no spikes were driven, the rivalry between head chainmen
and rear chainmen in being first to be set up and call out "Hook on!"
resulted in a stretch of 400 feet being measured in eight minutes. That
was a pace, however, that could not be long maintained. An average speed
of 1,000 feet and 1,200 feet per hour was made.
When the base line was in the city, the triangulatiou stations were
located on the roofs of nearby buildings. The short lines from the monu-
ments to these stations were measured in the same way as the long lines,
after a preliminary step which was done in the day time. One triangula-
tion station, for example, was on the parapet wall of a five-story factory
building, about 250 feet from the monument, and on the opposite side of
the street. A transit was set up over the monument, a back-sight taken
upon the triangulation station, and then a point was given to the man on
the roof where the line ran off the wall. Two points were also given on
the sidewalk close to the building, so that a portion of the line could be
drawn. The transit was then set up at a point opposite where the line
ran into the building. The man on the roof marked off a measured distance
on a piece of edging, such that when the strip was placed in line, with
one mark over the triangulation station, the other mark would clear the
wall. This mark was dropped down to the sidewalk by the transit, and
it is to the point thus located that the line was measured by the apparatus
as described.
In long lines, plugs for cut-offs may be set in the sidewalks at inter-
vals; and these may be read in by the transit when the tape happens to


be set up across the plug, the readings being taken simultaneously with the
end readings, and at no extra expense of time. If then, it should become
necessary to go back on account of a disturbed spider, or for any other
reason, a new start could be made at the last plug, by stretching the tape
across between the two spiders in the approximate positions they had
before, and reading the plug and the forward spider. This distance, added
to the distance between the plug and the rear spider as taken from the
notes of the first time over, will give a new distance between spiders,
which may be substituted for the original recorded distance over this
stretch, and the work continued anew from the forward spider. The
calibration and temperature corrections must be found independently for
each portion of this new distance.
TESTING THE TAPE.
All the different tapes used in measuring base were compared with
a standard tape whose absolute length was known, for a certain temper-
ature and for a tension of ten pounds, the tape being supported its entire
length. It was designed to test the tapes under the conditions of actual
use, in order to eliminate such corrections as possible. A bench somewhat
more than 100 feet long was obtained in a room where the temperature
was not subject to sudden fluctuations. Upon the ends of the bench were
fastened two zinc strips on cleats, with cross lines which were nearly
ioo feet apart. All the tapes were unreeled and hung up by the two ends,
that they might acquire the temperature of the room, which was recorded
throughout the test. The standard tape was first laid upon the bench and
supported throughout its length, and a pull of 10 pounds applied. Read-
ings on the two zinc marks were made at the same time, the thousandths
being read with the aid of a reading glass and a small scale graduated to
thousandths. This done, the tape to be compared was placed in position,
supported only every 20 feet, and the twelve-pound weight applied by
means of the tension wheel, and readings were then taken as on the
standard tape. The absolute distance between the marks was obtained
from the standard tape. The difference between the two end readings
on the base line tape gives the distance as measured in the field. The
difference between this and the true distance is a correction, which must
be applied to every 100-foot distance measured by that tape; and which
includes corrections for standardization, for sag, and for tension. This
leaves only two corrections remaining; namely, those for temperature and
for slope. In addition, however, the first and last foot of the tape were
calibrated by comparison with a standard Brown &amp; Sharpe one-foot steel
scale graduated to thousandths, and a table was made of the true readings
for each hundredth. In the reductions, the corrections above described
were not applied to each 100-foot space, but were entered in columns; and
these columns were algebraically added and the resulting correction applied
in one operation.
For the East River location, there are about 38,100 feet of base line,
in pieces 4.000 to 6,000 feet long. The total distance measured was 164,000
feet. The best determination that was made of a single line was that of
a line 4,800 feet long. Five measurements were made upon it, with a


resulting probable error of 1 in 2,400,000. The line with the greatest
probable error had 1 in 250,000; and the average was about 1 in 580,000.
This includes all of the measurements. Some of them were made in
the day time, and those had a much greater probable error than the night
measurements.
The cost of the apparatus might be itemized as follows:
4 spiders and tension apparatus $111 90
1 twelve-pound brass weight 11 00
1 tape 10 50
6 thermometers 1 20
1 anchor post, 4 intermediate standards 3 75
2 oil lanterns 1 20
5 gas lanterns 10 00
calcium carbide 4 00
2 hand axes 1 00
$154 55
THE COST OF THE WORK.
The cost of the work, counting in one-half the cost of the apparatus,
was $6.16 per 1,000 feet measured. This figure, however, includes some
items of expense for materials besides those given above, such as replacing
stolen brass; and the labor item is probably higher than would be neces-
sary in a party organized especially for such work.


A FEW REFLECTIONS.
W. G. SALTER, 95.
Ten years ago, when the writer left Michigan University, a gentleman
of commercial prominence said to him, "Sir, you are an expert penman
and bookkeeper of unusual ability, theoretically an engineer, and now with
your fine education, so versatile that you can cope with competitors in
many lines;" while another of vaster interests said, "The future is to be
an age of specialists," indicating the early decay of the old idea that
versatility or an all-around man was desirable for commercial considera-
tion.
During this decade I reflected on this more or less till intensely fas-
cinated with the results shown, and submit a query, the complete investi-
gation of which is endless and entangling, while the results are variable.
Under the regime of specialism, we are confronted with a most serious
problem of starting the young aspirant on the right path at the outset, and
the initial choice of his specialty is all-important, since past records reveal
only a small percentage of men following out their original designs, and
over 90% are diversions; the fruits of environing influences which they
did not, and perhaps could not forsee, but which appear evolutionary and
inevitable. Once the choice of a specialty is made the rest seems easy,
and to depend only upon the intelligent and systematic direction of the
young man's efforts. Now let us ask some questions:
First—Is man's success regulated by his mental capacity, will-power or
physical force alone?
Second—Is education in the theory of matter an essential to success?
Third—Is a college education (using this term to express the highest
type of education) necessary to develop the highest efficiency?
Fourth—If you answer No. 2 with "Yes," and No. 3 with "No,"
where would you differentiate between them?
Fifth—If this depends on conditions, how, and on what?
Sixth—Given two men, duplicates in everything except college educa-
tion, what is their relative value as commercial factors either in the posi-
tion of employer or employee?
Seventh—Does the law of supply and demand govern this?
I think there is no dispute in answering the first query with "No,"
and that all three attributes are concerned, for each depends intimately
on the other for efficiency. We have all known of notable exceptions
where two factors combined to produce great efficiency in the absence of
the third factor, but I think that we may agree that these examples suf-
fered by the deficiency. In other words, if we are given a combination
of any two without the third, the greatest efficiency is not developed.
For example, if we take a man of suberb mental capacity and will-
power, but of weak body, the correct support is not furnished to the
efforts of the first two. If we take a man of great will-power and phy-
sical force he may overcome deficient mentality in a degree; and if we
take one of mental capacity and physical force, the deficiency of the will-
power renders him almost useless, and in the latter example we seldom
find a success.


For question No. 2 there seems but one answer, "Yes;" since the
empirical investigation alone, necessary to verify hypothesis consumes
more than a mortal life term permits. We must look to co-operation of
others and take into account their deductions, in order to save time and
compete with the pace that commercial evolution sets up for us.
For questions No. 3, No. 4 and No. 5 there are many opinions, as
shown by the two expressions in the beginning of this paper, and there
is a doubt in the mind of the single individual as to where to draw the
line. There is no question in the author's mind that the college, or higher
education of any kind, renders the mind more versatile, better able to
grasp any new problems which arise, to conceive and execute any design of
its own or another, a faculty which in a business capacity becomes invalu-
able more and more in the presence of combination, concentration and
reorganization of commercial enterprises, carried out in order to acquire
sharp, clean-cut efficiency of the highest grade. A young man often comes
to me now, as I suppose to others, remarking that he doesn't know what
to choose, and seeking advice as dictated from my own experience. Some-
times I can speculate intelligently through personal knowledge of the
graduate and his past record; sometimes on the lucidity of his own state-
ment, but one has to be very careful to state that this is merely given as
his judgment, and not influence the young man to accept it as final, since
in after life he might become a most serious menace through the error on
your part. Often after finishing his college course he will ask the ques-
tion, "Where shall I begin?" and concluding that his education evidences
his purpose, it is sometimes easier to direct him as to the future. The
parent sending his boy away to school often asks the question, "Should
the boy be given some practical experience and then his final education,
or should these be inter-woven, allowing him to go to school part of the
time and work part of it; or should his vacations be given entirely to
recuperation, completing the college education first, and then turn him
loose?" I am of the opinion that a man will profit by a year's practical
experience of a varied nature, if he is a good, conscientious fellow, prior
to commencing his college course; in, that ordinary observation will show
him, or indicate more clearly the most attractive course to follow in life,
also to impress upon him the value of higher education, since a boy at this
age is often imbued with a contrary idea of self-inflation or of knowing a
great deal more than he does and being quite competent to give the older
generation pointers in many lines. I am also of the opinion that during
his college course alternations in the theoretical training and practical
experience will develop the ordinary man to a greater realization of the
value of theory and its meaning. If we take one who has just finished
his college education and then turn him loose, he has had his mind filled
so completely with theory that by the time some of it could be applied,
the thread of his purpose, training, etc., is lost, and he must review or
go back over the ground that he has formerly compassed. Still again,
there will be much of his course in college prescribed by the faculty as a
matter of system, that he is obliged to take in order to get a degree, and
which is distasteful and practically of no direct value, since he may never
use it again. In the sense that one branch of mathematics depends upon
the other, so one line of research develops its efficiency from contact with
another, and these courses are usually prescribed with that end in view.
We therefore can express no criticism adverse to this process. Modifying
circumstances must arise occasionally meriting the most earnest, prompt
attention, with a decision rapidly and accurately expressed, so that the


young man should constantly study his own position and anticipate such
consideration as far as possible. He should always conceive possible
influences arising from every standpoint within his range of vision, and
ask himself the question, "If placed in that situation, what is the best
thing to do?" This will be possible only to a limited extent, and vary with
the perception of the man concerned.
Anent the sixth question, the author would suggest, and thinks it
can be verified by the experience of others, that the employee without
the college education will attain a certain proficiency practically, during
the years allotted to his duplicate for theoretical training, which may,
at the expiration of the college-course period, leave him earning a salary
at which the graduate cannot expect to start; but with the superior tuition
or training of astute professors and scientists or specialists, the graduate
should soon overcome the difference between their compensation, as
it seems education is a ruling force in the world; ignorance being without
a doubt the greatest foe of mankind.
On the other hand, we find the college man, while versatile and
shifty, cultured and refined, through the advantage of his superior educa-
tion, is not always able to overcome the special training that his brother
has experienced in practice, along a specific line, for some years after-
wards, and the graduate will often ask the question in consequence,
whether it pays to go to college. This has led many of our leading cap-
italists and manufacturers to conclude in favor of a reasonable education,
but doubt the efficiency of the higher theoretical training. In the course
of my observation, I have connected myself temporarily in various capac-
ities with various institutions, among them manufacturers, mercantile
concerns and intermediaries; always in a responsible capacity, so as to
study this matter with the best possible scope or range of vision.
On the seventh question, unlimited in scope, I finally came to the
conclusion that the age of specialism tends toward unequal distribution
of supply, in as much as the most attractive field at one time attracts the
most men at that time and for sometime afterwards; while the most at-
tractive field often becomes the least attractive, within the range of a
single generation, and the specialist is unable to shift so rapidly. This
leads to considerable confusion, and the specialist is often thrown back on
his haunches after becoming a factor of considerable efficiency. On the
other hand, the commercial interests are carrying forward their evolution
so rapidly that specialists cannot be developed fast enough to supply their
needs, and the result of this is a crying need at all times for men far in
advance of their development. It is therefore easier for a specialist to
market his services at almost any time than to find the specialist equipped
for the exigencies that may arise. A business house first finds itself in
the embarrassing position that they cannot look for this man themselves
and institutions are developed to take up this work in their behalf. This
has led to a type of institutions originally conceived by a very bright
woman of Boston, whose idea soon found its reflection in almost every city
on the continent, and the assets required to conduct such an enterprise
were so slight that the so-called grafting feature soon became pre-eminent
and they were classified as a "graft scheme," pure and simple, none of
them being recognized as beneficial or legitimate.
The organization of an ideal institution intermediate, between the
employer and employee, between the investor and the investment, between
the man of large commercial interests whose confidence must be delegated
in a measure to someone else, and the efficient specialist who cannot seek


another connection without embarrassment in his present position, was
then conceived by the writer and others to promote co-operation. This
was to be developed and organized with the assistance of the leading
business men in Chicago, as an economic institution or club where all
classes might find a general clearing house for their needs. The author
has an imaginary conception embracing gymnasium, swimming tank, lec-
ture hall, hall for parties and dances, libraries, etc., and separate apart-
ments in the building for different gradations of men, all of whom could
be admitted to membership only after their status had been thoroughly
investigated; an institution established on a plane admitting of no question
as to its intents or ideals, and where all compensation paid for the service
rendered to the individual would be thrown directly into the treasury for
general advancement and support rather than into the hands or pockets
of private individuals. I believe such an institution rightly conducted, with
clear, experienced commercial intellects, or perhaps retired business men,
giving their time and attention or some of their expert service to its
management, would receive a greater measure of confidence from all
classes and promote cordiality between the employer and employee. I
would not approve of this institution as a state or municipal organization.
It might be governmental in its control, but should be so organized as to
admit of no possible political reflection. Leading commercial houses through-
out the country are adopting new tactics in regard to men graduating
from college, and we find our college deans of the present day, especially
those in the technical lines, buried under an avalanche of requests for
graduates, to incorporate into great organizations, starting them with only
the requirement of purpose, and offering unlimited prospects of advance-
ment. This would indicate to the writer the growing appreciation of a
college education, and in this connection he might suggest the personal
knowledge of many concerns looking forward to the exodus of such mate-
rial in June with great anxiety for fear that they may not be able to
obtain some of the supply, and these firms or corporations are doubling
their efforts in the past few years to produce the best organization, to
acquire the high degree of efficiency which would enable them to meet
any and all competition on the best possible commercial basis. Increased
efficiency of their plant demands primarily increased efficiency in its man-
agement, which has come to mean that education is the basis of such
organization.
The writer has acted confidentially along these lines in the interests
of independent concerns seeking special men as managers, or for other
responsible capacities, where the introduction of subsidized material by a
"Trust" or other institution, competitive in nature, unscrupulous in de-
sign, might have or previously had been accomplished. Many of these
instances are recalled, i. e.: a very pleasant gentleman of wealth sent for me
one day to secure him a shop superintendent, and our search produced an
exceptional applicant, who was at once engaged. He steadily grew in favor
with my client for over eight months, when Mr. was startled to
learn that for six months past his "Pet" had been subsidized by the
"Trust" at only twenty-five dollars per month, to "sell out" his employer.
Mr. Superintendent was discharged, and appealed to the "Trust" for em-
ployment, but they had measured him and refused any sympathy or con-
sideration.
A business house cannot often afford to have the opening known to
the public, and therefore cannot seek the individual they desire. The man


whom they seek cannot afford to be known publicly as available, and there-
fore both are in need of such services.
I have in a measure answered the questions I asked. They are good
questions, indicating a wide range, and I advance them for your consider-
ation only to invite your anticipation of what may arise in the future, and
in hopes that they may be of service to my brother alumni or the students,
who are also brothers, though only starting upon life's course. The author
passed through the state himself, and well recollects with what anxiety he
viewed the future; with what anxiety he anticipated the applications, and
although a success commercially, to some degree feels that better direc-
tion of his efforts might have been possible had he been able to circumvent
some points that he now grasps with confidence induced by experience.
As onward life's pathway you stride
And take note of the scenes by the way,
Remember there's always a bright side
To every cloud in your sky.


AN EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF RANKINE'S
THEORY OF EARTH PRESSURE.
ABSTRACT OF A THESIS BY F. C. STEVENS AND R. D. GOODRICH, '03.
The apparatus used in making this investigation consisted of a frame
carrying two parallel horizontal rollers 42 inches long and about two feet
apart. A strip of cotton cloth about five feet long was hung between these
rollers, forming a triangle-like bag, which was filled with dry sand. By
means of horizontal and vertical scales attached to the frame coordinates
of the outline of the bag could be measured and the curve plotted. The
method pursued in the experiments was as follows: a known weight of
sand, varying from 200 to 500 lbs. in different experiments, was placed
in the receptacle, its surface leveled, and the apparatus left standing to
allow the sand to settle and the cloth to assume the curve of equilibrium.
The settlement of the sand was undoubtedly hastened by the jar from
passing electric cars. After about a week's time the co-ordinates of the
curve of the device were taken and the curve plotted. The theoretical
curve was then found and the two compared.
Before going further, it may be well to state Rankine's theory of
earth pressure. Rankine assumes that earth is a granular substance, the
stability of which depends only upon the friction between the grains.
Starting with this assumption, it can be shown that on any horizontal
plane below the surface of the level ground, the pressure is vertical and
.equal to the weight of the earth above that plane. This vertical pressure
(of intensity, Pi) gives rise to a horizontal pressure (of intensity Pi),
the ratio between these pressures being:
Pi 1 — sin *
Pi 1 + sin +
in which * is the angle of repose of earth. If Pi and Pi are laid off
as the semi-major and semi-minor axes of an ellipse, the intensity of
stress on an inclined plane passing through the point at which Pi and Pi
act will be given as a radius of the ellipse, and the direction of this stress
will make an angle with the normal to its plane between o and * .
In order to obtain the theoretical curve of equilibrium, it was necessary
to find the angle of repose of the sand. The angle used was 31° —42' the
mean of a number of determinations, the extremes of which were 300 —
38' and 330 —02'. It was found that the difference of a degree or a degree
and a half, either way from the mean, had no appreciable effect upon the
theoretical curve of equilibrium.
A typical example of the results obtained is shown in Fig. 1. The
upper curve is the actual shape of the bag, and the horizontal line is the
surface of the sand. The figure, which is supposed to be one inch thick
in a direction normal to the plane of the paper, was divided into vertical
prisms one inch square, and the load considered to act along their center
lines, which are shown in the figure. At the vertex, Pi is equal to the
depth multiplied by the weight of one cubic inch of sand, or 1,036 lbs.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC.
per square inch; Pi, computed from the ratio given above = 1.036 X 0.311
= 0.322 lbs. Having found Pi and Pi, the ellipse of stress can be drawn,
and the direction and intensity of stress at the base of any prism found if
the base is assumed to be a plane whose direction is given by the tangent
to the curve at the middle ordinate of that prism. The construction is
shown in Fig. 2. The lines radiating from o represent the directions and
intensities of pressure on the required planes, but at a depth below the
surface of the sand equal to the middle ordinate of Fig. 1. The force
acting at the base of any prism was obtained by reducing the intensity
given in Fig. 2, by the ratio of the depth at the center, and multiplying by
the area of the base of the prism. The oblique lines of Fig. 1 represent
these forces, both in magnitude and direction.

These forces were then laid off on a load line, as shown in Fig. 3, and
a pole chosen so that the closing line of the force polygon should be par-
allel to the tangent of the curve at the surface of the sand. From the
force polygon a curve of equilibrium was drawn, which lay below the
actual curve, as shown. The vertical projection of the load line should
equal half the weight of sand in a segment one inch thick. The vertical
reaction, as scaled from the diagram, is 7.23 lbs., whereas the actual half
load was 6.55 lbs., hence the theoretical load exceeded the actual by 10.4%.
A number of experiments were made with different depths of sand
in the bin, but the example illustrated is typical of all. In every case the
theoretical curve fell below the actual, and the theoretical load exceeded
the actual.


Although the number of experiments was limited, there are a few
conclusions which can safely be drawn. The catenary gives some idea of
the character of the desired curve, but does not give any insight into the
loads and stresses. The experiments also showed conclusively that Ran-
kine's theory gives greater loads and stresses than actually exist. The
percentage of error increases with an increase of load, but the number of
experiments and the range of loads were hardly enough to warrant this
statement as a general law. The curve of equilibrium is not changed by
reducing the theoretical load by the percentage of error in the load line,
as making such change is equivalent to changing the density of the sand.
In order to make the theoretical curve of equilibrium approach the actual,
it is necessary to increase P2 with reference to Pi, which is equivalent
to reducing the angle of repose. The ratio of Pa to Pi, used in determin-
ing the forces acting on the bin, is the least possible value consistent with
the angle of repose of the sand, but the mass is stable if Pi is increased
by some means beyond its least value. It is possible that P» was increased
by impact or jar beyond the amount computed, and used in these experi-
ments, which would account for the fact that the theoretical curve fell
below the actual.


THE TESTING OF LUBRICATING OILS.
THESIS BY F. C. PARMENTER, '03.
The author of this thesis has not endeavored to verify any of the
many so-called "Laws of Friction" or "Laws of Lubrication," but has
merely attempted to carry out, in as complete a manner as possible, a
modern test of a variety of standard lubricating oils. The lubricants
tested cover the three general classes into which it is customary to divide
oils, namely animal oils, seed oils, and mineral oils.
Modern tests of lubricating oils are directed, according to Dr. Robt.
H. Thurston, in his treatise on "Friction and Lost Work in Machinery,"
toward determining the following:
1. Their identification and the detection of adulteration.
2. The measurement of density.
3. The determination of their viscosity.
4. The detection of tendency to gum.
5. The determination of temperatures of decomposition, vaporization
and ignition.
6. Determination of cold test.
7. The detection of acidity.
8. The measurement of the co-efficient of friction.
9. The determination of their endurance and their power of keeping
the surfaces cool.
The results of the test as conducted are taken up below in the order
just named, and the thesis is divided into parts in order to make this
arrangement more clear. In several instances curves are plotted in order
to show more definitely the relation between the different properties.
A word regarding the cost of these oils may not be out of order, but
since the selling price of lubricants varies greatly depending upon the
condition of the market, the season of the year, and the location of the
point of consumption, actual values would be of little use. However, since
under ordinary conditions the selling prices of the different lubricants do
not vary greatly relatively, a list of the oils arranged in the order of their
cost may be of some value. The following is such a list, beginning with
the highest priced oils:
1. Sperm oil.
2. Lard oil.
3. Cotton seed oil.
4. Linseed oil.
5. Straits oil.
6. Solar Red oil.
7. Atlantic Red oil.
8. Zone oil.
9. Diamond Paraffine oil.
10. Straw oil.
The Identification and the Detection of Adulteration.—The
chemistry of oils is a very complicated subject, and one which cannot
be handled with any sort of satisfactory results by persons other than
experts in that line. The detection of foreign matter in an oil can only
be made after a series of chemical reactions, giving rise to certain colors


93
which often vary by the merest shade. Owing to these uncertainties and to
the fact that the author is not familiar with the subject of qualitative
analysis, nothing was done on this part of the test.
The Measurement of Density.—The measurement of density was
made with a standard Beaume hydrometer. Gravities of each of the oils
were taken at temperatures of 50°, 75", 100°, 125°, 1500 F. Fahrenheit
degrees are used throughout this treatise, as is customary in all oil work.

The Determination of Viscosity.—The viscosity of an oil is closely
related, but not proportional to its density, as may be seen by referring to
the viscosity-specific gravity curves below. The viscosity of these oils was
determined by a Standard Oil Co. standard viscosimeter, which consists
of a small brass cylindrical vessel, about 3^ ounces of water capacity,
surrounded by a bath of water. At the bottom of the vessel is a small
hole through which the oil is allowed to run, and the time required to
empty the vessel through this hole when filled with oil, compared to the
time required with water, is a measure of the oil's viscosity.
Two runs were made for each of the following temperatures, 50°, 750,
ioo", 1250, 150° F. for each oil, and the averages of the results are given in
the following table:

Any arbitrary constant which is proportional to the distance traveled
and inversely proportional to the time consumed may, generally speaking,
be taken as a measure of the oil's ability to withstand the oxidizing effect
of the air.


The Determination op Temperatures of Decomposition, Vaporiza-
tion and Ignition.—The temperature when the oil begins to decompose
is very difficult to determine with any accuracy and is of very little impor-
tance, but the temperatures of vaporization and ignition may be found with
comparative ease and considerable precision.
These tests were made in a so-called open cup, which consists of a
small shallow cup of iron resting over a gas burner, and with a high
reading thermometer so suspended that its bulb is just covered when the
dish is filled with oil. The burner was lighted and the temperature of the
oil was raised at a rate of about five degrees every minute. When the oil
began to give off fumes to any considerable extent, a lighted taper was
passed at short intervals within about a quarter of an inch of the surface
of the oil, and the temperature at which it flashed and ignited were re-
corded, and are given in the table below.

Determination of Cold Test.—In taking the cold test of an oil, the
chill and freeze points are usually required. They are taken to determine
the behavior of the oil at low temperature. The chill point was taken
when the first cloud appeared in the oil, but in those oils which would give
no cloud the temperature of chill was counted at that temperature at which
the oil failed to drop readily from the thermometer when the latter was
lifted out of the oil. The temperature of freezing was taken as that
temperature at which the oil failed to pour when the tube which contained
it was tilted at an angle of forty-five degrees. Two tests were taken for
chill and one for freeze, and the results are given in the following table.

The Detection of Acidity.—This test requires the knowledge of con-
siderable chemistry to give any kind of satisfactory results, and the author
has not attempted to do anything with it.
The Determination of the Co-efficient of Friction.—This part of
the test was conducted on an Ashcroft oil testing machine, manufactured
by the Ashcroft Manufacturing Company, of Boston, Mass. The machine
consists of a 3-inch axle revolving under a brass box, the pressure of the
box upon the axle being regulated by an overhanging arm, at the end of
which is a pan to receive weights. The tendency of the box to rotate is
resisted by this overhanging arm, which connects to a guage.
Three runs were made for each oil; two with a total pressure of 95.5
pounds, or 8.91 pounds per sq. inch on the bearing, and one run with a
total pressure of 186.7 pounds, or 17.43 pounds per sq. inch on the bearing.
For one of the 95.5 runs and for the 186.7 runi a constant feed of one
drop of oil on the bearing per minute was maintained by the use of an
oil cup, and ten drops were allowed to accumulate before the machine
was started up. This was practically equivalent to a flooded bearing.
In the other 95.5 pound run, five drops of oil from a dripper were
placed on the bearing and a constant feed of one drop every five minutes
was maintained. The oil was allowed to feed into the machine for ten
minutes before starting up, in order to allow the passage from the oil cup
to the bearing to become filled with oil. The feed, although somewhat
light, did very well for most of the oils; in the tables of the results on
friction it will be called the "Limited Feed." Great care was exercised
to thoroughly clean the machine between each run. A table of the co-
efficient of friction of the oils tested for the temperature of 1200 F.,
which is the temperature at which one can just bear one's hand upon the
bearing, will be given at this point.

THE DETERMINATION OF THEIR ENDURANCE AND THEIR POWER OF KEEPING THE
SURFACES COOL.
The method used to determine the durability of a lubricant is to
consider the endurance proportional to the number of revolutions of the
bearing required to raise the temperature to a fixed point, for instance,

temperature to 1600 F. is considered proportional to the ability of the oil
to keep the bearings cool.
To the Ashcroft machine is attached also a counter and a thermom-
eter. The thermometer is placed on the box and its bulb is placed in an

AN INVESTIGATION OF THE ALUMINUM CARBON
CELL.
THESIS BY R. P. JACKSON, 02.
This paper deals with the great apparent resistance which an aluminum
electrode offers to an electric current in various electrolytes. The follow-
ing are references to papers which deal with that and accompanying phe-
nomena.
Buff—Liebigs Annalen, 1857. Vol. 102, p. 269. The author mentions
that he was not able to pass a current through a cell having aluminum as
an anode.
Streintz—Wied. Annalen, 1887. Vol. 32, p. 116. He suggests a kind
of dielectric polarization, distinct from ordinary electrolytic polarization,
as a cause of the apparent high resistance between the electrode and the
aluminum plate.
Graetz—Wied. Annalen, 1897. Vol. 62, No. 10, pp. 320-327. With
direct currents, Graetz gives 22 volts as the E.M.F. which an aluminum
anode may oppose.
Pollack—Comptes Rendus, 1897. Vol. 124. With an aluminum anode
in an alkaline solution he noticed a very large drop of potential across the
cell, while there was a very small drop when the aluminum was the
cathode. He proposed to use aluminum in a cell for producing unidirec-
tional current from an alternating current.
E. Wilson—Proc. Royal Society, 1898, p. 329. Experiments with both
alternating and direct currents. He states that there is a film of apparent
high resistance formed on the aluminum plate. This film is said to be
basic aluminum sulphate.
Norden—Zeit. fuer Elektro chemie, Sept. 7 and 14, 1899. Investigates
the high resistance phenomena and the chemical reactions occuring at the
aluminum anode. They are found to be very complicated.
Batelli—Elek. Zeit., Oct. 12, 1899. Experiments with different elec-
trolytes. Found best results with the double salt of chromium and potas-
sium, in which there was apparently a counter E.M.F. of 65 volts per
cell.
Polzenus—Elektrochemie Zeit, Dec, 1900. Finds phosphoric acid and
fluoric acid give as high as 120 volts drop across cells. With bichromate
of potassium, 80 volts drop was obtained, and minute sparks were noticed
on the aluminum plate.
Mayrhofer—Elek. Zeit., Nov. 1 and 8, 1890. Gives a series of experi-
ments with the Graetz aluminum cell and alternating currents. A variety
of wave forms with various electrodes was obtained. The cell was called
the electric valve.
W. S. Andrews—Electrical World and Engineer, March 24, 1900.
Experiments with aluminum cells with an electrolyte of double tartarate of
potassium and sodium. This cell had a very high apparent resistance. It
was able to withstand 80 to 90 volts if the plates were formed slowly with
from s to 10 volts. He states that a Wehnelt interrupter is easily made


by touching a bit of copper wire to the aluminum plate under the electro-
lyte, thus short-circuiting the film. The film was considered to be of
aluminum oxide, having a high resistance.
Dr. K. Norden—Electrical World and Engineer, Oct. 12, 1904, made
experiments with alum and other solutions. He gives a theory of the
electrolytic action. He analyzed the anodic film on the aluminum plate and
found it lo be aluminum hydroxide,—AU(CH)t. It is explained that the
negative ions are unable to penetrate the film and touch the metal, but no
adequate theory is given why the current passes through in the other
direction.
Prof. C. F. Burgess—Electrical World and Engineer, April 12, 1902,
made experiments with fused electrodes. Higher rectifying efficiency
was obtained than with aqueous solutions. Peculiar behavior assumed to
be due to insulating coating of oxide. This coating is not entirely insulat-
ing, but permits small leakage currents.
"E. H."—L'Industrie Electr., July 10. 1901. The cells used developed
an ability to resist 200 volts. A "dielectric" layer was said to be formed,
which is maintained by the current itself. The electrolyte was a slightly
acid solution of phosphate of potassium. .
In my experiments there were two objects in view. The first was to
determine the nature of the action of the aluminum cell: that is, whether
it is a high selective resistance or a high counter E.M.F. The second
purpose was to find some combination that would make an efficient recti-
fier of alternating current.


Fig.&amp;
The cells used were of an aluminum plate about 1/16 inch thick and
30 sq. cm. imrjrersed area, and a carbon plate about % inch thick and of
the same area. The two plates were % inch apart.
The electrolyte mainly used was a saturated solution of potash alum,
Ah(SOt)a, KiSOt, 24H1O. The resistance of this solution, at 24°C was
found by the alternating current method to be 63.6 ohms per cm. cube,
which gave about one ohm per cell.
To use the cell, the plate was formed simply by subjecting it to five or
more volts with the aluminum as anode. The first experiment was to
apply an E.M.F. alternately in each direction and measure the current and
difference of potential. Fig. 1 shows the arrangement of apparatus.

was then but one or two milliamperes. Beyond 29 volts the current
seems to rise in proportion to the additional volts. This would appear to
indicate an electrolytic resistance plus a counter E.M.F. of about 29
volts. The apparent resistance falls as the current increases, as in curves
1 and 2. Curve 1 is for aluminum as anode and curve 2 for it as cathode.
Curves 3 and 4 show the same quantities for a solution of chromic acid—
HiCrOi. The chromic acid developes not nearly so high a drop across
the cell; seldom going above 25 volts.

Another experiment was made to determine the change of resistance
with variation in size of the aluminum plate, the electrolytic path remain-
ing the same length. In reality the size of the plate has almost no effect
until it becomes so small that the electrolytic resistance drop becomes a
large part of the total. The larger part of the drop in potential across
the cell is due to a counter E.M.F. of from 29 to 30 volts with a potash
alum electrolyte, and about 23 volts with chromic acid.
By using an exploring electrode of copper, the drop from various
portions of the electrolyte to the aluminum plate could be found. There
was usually a slight drop from carbon to electrolyte and a little more
through the electrolyte, but with the alum solution there was always from
28 to 30 volts across the film on the aluminum plate. On touching the
plate with a piece of copper below the electrolyte, sparks would appear
as the current broke through to the copper, and from thence through the
electrolyte to the cathode. The potential would of course drop to that of
copper and carbon in alum.
The following values are the drops across the cell with different elec-
trolytes and 0.5 amp. current and with 73 volts applied. All but dilute
sulphuric acid show a decided difference in drop between the two direc-
tions of the current through the cell.

NaCl 33. total 41. 13.
Before being placed in chromic acid, the plates had been in HiSOt,
which had evidently eaten off the film, so a new film had to form. The
NaCl shows the highest drop measured; showing 33. volts across the
film and 41 from one plate to the other, but the electrolytic resistance was
also probably high, as shown by the drop of 13 volts when carbon was
anode.
It appears from these results, that a counter E.M.F. which varies
with the nature of the electrolyte is developed; that the pressure above
this counter E.M.F. divided by the electrolytic resistance, produces the
usual current according to Ohm's law; also that this counter EM.F. does
not persist after the circuit is broken.
Experiments were made with alternating current, and curves were
taken to observe how much the anodic wave is suppressed. The first
experiment was with four cells in series and curves No. 5 show the E.M.
F. of the generator, the current through a bank of lamps, and the current
when the four cells were in series with the lamps. Values were taken with
the contact maker, and current was measured by taking the drop across
the lamps. Both curves show a lead, but the partly suppressed wave does
not show as much lead as the others. This lead betrays a capacity of some
kind. Curves of N0.6, for two cells in series show the E.M.F. of the
machine and that across the cells, while the non-inductive current and the
current through the cells are also shown. The scale of volts reads in
volts per cell, though two cells were used in series. The line ab shows
that the current becomes zero when the E.M.F. across the cell equals 23
to 25 volts, and is then started in the opposite direction by the slight mo-
mentary discharge of the counter E.M.F. In the other direction the

current does not become zero until the applied E.M.F. drops to 3.5 volts,
but the discharge of the counter E.M.F. is greater than with the other
high counter E.M.F. and makes the hump on the curve. In the lower
curves No. 7, the applied E.M.F. was made much less and the hump h on
the suppressed wave becomes most prominent. After it has passed, the
current drops to a very low value. It is this hump, coupled with the
apparent leakage even at the low pressure of 8 volts per cell that causes
the inefficiency of the cell as a rectifier. A cell in which the counter
E.M.F. in one direction was zero and that in the other direction high and
quick to act, should be a good rectifying device.

CURVES 6 AND 7. SUPPRESSION OF ANODIC WAVE—TWO CELLS IN SERIES.
While the lead of the cell current is evidently caused by a capacity,
it cannot be a true electrostatic capacity. If the film were nonconducting
and puncturable and the capacity electrostatic, the combination would be
a high resistance through the holes of the film and a condensance in
parallel. The condensance component would then be so small that it
would have no effect compared with the conductance component, because
of the small size of the plates. There could then be no appreciable lead
of current ahead of E.M.F. If the capacity is electrolytic, however, it
may be much larger and act as a capacity in series with a resistance. That
they do act in this way is shown, for the more cells there are in series the
greater the lead and the less the capacity.
From the two angles of lead of current in the curves of No. 7 the
capacity of the cells was calculated. With aluminum as anode the capacity
of the cell of 30 sq. cm. area was 3200 microfarads. With aluminum as


I05
cathode the apparent capacity was 6400 microfarads. These, of course, are
only rough values, but show that the capacity can not be electrostatic.
Dr. Guthe has advanced the theory that the film on the aluminum plate
is semi-permeable, and that when the current is going toward it, the
small hydrogen ions can be pushed through and give up their charges.
Here they either remain and collect to form a gas which breaks the film
or they are absorbed, or are enabled in some way to get back through the
film and rise to the top of the electrolyte. On the other hand, when the
larger negative ions approach the film they are unable to push their way
through, and so are banked up in a layer of great density in the electrolyte,
each ion possessing a negative charge which it cannot release. In this
way a sq. cm. can hold bound a much larger quantity than a sq. cm. of
the plate acting solely as a condenser and having a charge on the surface
only.
If the E.M.F. is raised above a certain point, the ions either squeeze
through or are broken up into smaller elements which can get through the
film to the aluminum plate and give up their charges. When, however,
the circuit is broken the layer of negatively charged ions immediately dis-
appears. That is, the ions repell each other and disperse through the

electrolyte, which explains the almost instant disappearance of the counter
E.M.F. on breaking the circuit. The difference in the counter E.M.F.,
found with different electrolytes, suggests that they depend on the nature
of the negative ion brought to the aluminum plate.
With the alum solution there is gas evolved and heat developed with
very small currents. With chromic acid there is no gas unless the current
density is very large and there is very little heat developed, though the
counter E.M.F. is about 23 volts.
In regard to the use of these cells as a rectifying device, the following
experiments were made:
A combination of four cells was made in the form shown in Fig. 2.
The heavy lines indicate carbon and the light ones aluminum. With an
alternating E.M.F. applied, the current from x to y is unidirectional and
can be measured either with an electrodynamometer or an ammeter. Curve
No. 8 shows the wave form of the current through x and y and the E.M.F.
of the generator: the frequency was 135. The current curve was taken


as before by taking the instantaneous drop across a non-inductive resis-
tance.
Experiments on the effect of such rectification show the best efficiency
with from 27 to 35 volts applied, but no such efficiency can be obtained
if a resistance is placed in the circuit xy. The efficiency is not high and
depends upon the frequency, the voltage applied, and the electrolyte used.
An electrolyte giving a very quick-acting polarization and a small amount
of heat developed might give the desired results.


TEST OF A KEROSENE ENGINE.
THESIS OF W. A. DETWILER, '02, AND L. N. UDELL, '02.
The test of this kerosene engine was made in the mechanical engineer-
ing laboratory of the University of Michigan. The engine was direct from
the factory and had been run very little before the test was started, the
amount which it had been run consisting of the tests made at the factory
by the makers, and of a few short preliminary runs which we made to
acquaint ourselves with the operation of it. The engine was rated at two
brake horse-power. It is called the Mietz &amp; Weitz engine, and is manu-
factured by August Mietz, New York City.
DESCRIPTION OF ENGINE.
The diameter of the cylinder is 454 inches and the length of the stroke
is 6l/2 inches. The piston is of the trunk type with three cast-iron packing
rings with staggered joints. The opening and closing of the admission and
exhaust ports is effected by the movement of the piston along the cylinder.
The crank shaft and connecting rod are enclosed in an air tight
casing. This casing answers the purpose of a chamber for compressing
the air to furnish a blast for scavenging. Besides the above purpose of
the chamber, it prevents any odors escaping from around the piston. The
tank containing the kerosene is placed directly over the crank shaft, and
the oil is forced from this tank into the cylinder by means of a small force
pump.
OPERATION.
The method of operation is as follows. Air is drawn into the crank
chamber from the interior of the base through a port in the lower part
of the cylinders. As the piston moves forward this air in the crank
chamber is being compressed. When the piston nears the end of its
forward stroke the exhaust port on the lower side of the cylinder is
opened. Closely following this point comes the opening of the port on
the upper side of the cylinder, allowing the air from the crank case to rush
to the combustion side of the piston. This air enters the cylinder with;
sharp blast. It strikes the lip of the piston and is deflected toward the
head end of the cylinder, thus driving out the burnt gases through the
exhaust port, and at the same time leaving a change of air for combustion.
The oil is injected into the cylinder and there it is mixed with the air so
that, on the completion of the backward or compression stroke, the mix-
ture of oil, vapor and air is automatically ignited, expansion taking
place on the next forward stroke.
The ignition is effected by the rise in temperature of the mixture
due to compression and the heat evolved from the ignitor ball. This
ignitor ball has a lip entending into the combustion space of the cylinder
upon which the jet of oil strikes and is there vaporized. Upon starting
the engine, this ball has to be heated externally by a lamp.
The regulation of speed is effected by a centrifugal governor changing
the throw of the eccentric. This changes the length of the stroke of the
oil pump, thus varying the quantity of oil which is injected per stroke.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC.
Should the speed become excessive, the throw of the eccentric changes so
as to give no movement of the pump plunger, thus stopping entirely the
injection of oil into the cylinder.
APPARATUS.
The indicator used for the tests up to test No. 5 was a Crosby, de-
signed especially for gas engine work. This indicator becoming out of
order the Bachelder indicator was used. The springs of both indicators
were carefully calibrated, and corrections for the temperature of the spring

made. A reduction of the motion of the piston was secured by a small
pin in one end of the crank shaft, to which was attached a string kept in
tension by a spring at the other end. This string had a loop to which
could be hooked a second string moving over a pulley to the indicator
drum.
The brake used was a Prony brake of the ordinary type. A flange
was bolted on to the pulley in order to retain the necessary cooling water.
The number of explosions was determined by a Morse contact breaker.
This instrument was operated mechanically by a small paddle placed over
a small pipe leading from the exhaust pipe.
All of the thermometers used in the tests were carefully calibrated.
The temperature of the exhaust gases was determined by the use of
a mercury pyrometer reading to 9000 Fahrenheit. This pyrometer was
placed in the exhaust pipe about six feet from the exhaust port. The

exhaust pipe, however, up to the pyrometer was lagged with thick asbestos
pipe covering.
The kerosene used was measured by means of a float in the oil tank
carrying a rod calibrated to fifths of a pound. One could easily read to
within a few hundredths of a pound.
The amount of cooling water was determined by allowing the water
to run into tanks where it was weighed on ordinary scales.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC.
The Orsat apparatus was used in determining the analysis of the
exhaust gases.
For determining the heat value of the oil, the Jounker calorimeter
was made use of.
OBSERVATIONS.
During the various tests practically all observations were made at five
minute intervals.
The revolutions of the engine were determined by a common hand
speed indicator. The explosions were counted for a period of about one
minute simultaneous with the time that the cards and the number of revo-
lutions were being taken.
Thermometers used in determining the initial and final temperatures
of the jacket cooling water were inserted in the inflowing and outflowing
pipes. These temperatures along with the room air temperature were
taken every five minutes.
The water was weighed every half hour. It was endeavored to keep
the temperature of the cooling water constant throughout each run, and

on, CONSUMPTION.
this temperature was about 150° Fahrenheit. On one test at full load and
on one at zero load, the water was kept as low as 100° Fahrenheit. Read-
ings on the oil scale were taken every half hour, thus checking the readings
for the total amount.
Exhaust gas analysis was taken two or three times during the test.
On the tests up to May 28, one indicator card was taken every five
minutes, and the pencil was allowed to remain on the card for two or


three revolutions in order to get an average area. On tests after this
about three cards every five minutes were taken, and the point was left
on the card for one revolution only. It was found that the latter method
made it easier to planimeter the cards. In planimetering the cards all of
the diagrams were traced and the areas averaged.
CALCULATIONS.
la
The constant in the formula for the indicated horse-power is
33,000
2 /
= 0.000261, while that for the brake horse-power is = 0.000499,'
33.000
being the length of the brake arm, which is 3154 inches.
The frictional horse-power was determined by subtracting the brake
horse-power from the indicated horse-power.
Brake Horse-power
The mechanical efficiency =
Indicated Horse-power.
The thermal efficiency was calculated by dividing the heat equivalent
of the indicated horse-power hour by the British Thermal Units in the
oil consumed per hour.
The heat lost to the jacket water was obtained by multiplying the
weight of water run through the jacket by the difference of the initial and
final temperature of the water.
The heat lost in the exhaust was calculated in the following manner.
The quantity of air forced into the combustion chamber from the crank
chamber was calculated from the dimensions of the engine. This volume
was found to be about 0.0506 cubic feet or 0.0041 pounds for each revolu-
tion. The quantity of heat lost per hour is the product of the weight of
the air per revolution, times the difference of the temperature of the inlet
air and the exhaust air, times the specific heat of the gas which was
assumed to be about that of air.
GENERAL REMARKS.
During some of the tests, particularly those at heavy loads, some
trouble was experienced in the engine slowing down and finally stopping.
This occurred when the temperature of the cooling water became high
and the ignitor ball became too hot. This slowing down and stopping was
probably due to premature explosions, caused by the overheating of the
cylinder walls and the ignitor ball. These premature explosions were
accompanied by a pounding in the reciprocating parts. Besides making
themselves evident by this pounding they could be plainly seen from some
of the indicator cards.
After the first seven runs the engine was taken apart and thoroughly
cleaned. The walls of the combustion chamber were found to be covered
with a heavy layer of carbon.
Characteristic cards from a few of the runs have been traced and
are shown.
Various curves have been drawn showing the principal results as
ordinates, and the indicated horse-power as abscissae. The following ones
are here shown with the indicated horse-power in each case as abscissae
and the brake horse-power, mechanical efficiency, and the oil consumption
per horse-power hour as ordinates.


The air used per hour in the engine was calculated in two ways; first
from the dimensions of the engine; and second, from the analysis of the
exhaust gases. The results do not check, due to the fact that in calculating
the amount of air from the exhaust gases it is assumed that all of the oil
going to the cylinder has been burned. From the results it can be con-
cluded that this is not the case, as all the values figured by the second
method are much larger than those calculated from the first. This un-
burned oil enters into the thermal efficiency, and a large part of the loss
of heat in item No. 35 of the summary table is probably due to charging
the engine with the heat in the oil which is not burned.

The oil used in these runs was tested for its heat value and its flash-
joint. The heat value was found to be 18,625 B.T.U.'s per pound of oil,
and the flash-point was 1200 Fahrenheit. The many premature explosions
noted in some of these runs is probably due to this low flash-point of the
oil. The engine was designed for oil of 1500 test.
From the curve showing the oil consumption per horse-power, it may
be seen that the lowest amount of oil used is for two brake horse-power,
the load which the engine is rated to carry.
Several indicator cards were taken from the crank case in order to
determine the power used in compressing the air for scavenging. The
average power consumed in compressing this air is 0.103 indicated horse-
power. Several of the cards are shown.

EDITORIALS.
The Technic Board feels a little pride in offering their work for your
inspection earlier than usual this year, although not so early as originally
promised. We hope our readers will find it compares favorably with that
of last year's Board. The demand for the 1903 volume of the Michigan
Technic has been so great that the combined first and second editions of
1,600 copies have been completely exhausted. We are anxious to buy a
few copies to complete sets of the Technic, and any who have extra copies
are requested to correspond with us. It may be noticed that we are
issuing 2,000 copies of this number.
The Engineering Department has undergone many changes this year.
We have told elsewhere of the loss of Professor Greene, so long head of
the Department, and of the appointment of Professor Cooley as Dean and
of Professor Davis as Associate Dean. The Engineering Department of
the University of Michigan now contains about 800 students. With
another freshman class of 350 it will become a question, indeed, as to
how to accommodate the classes. The new building, although not yet
completed, has been partially occupied for several months; it will be wholly
ready by next fall.
The Engineering Society has also grown, numbering now about 130
members, probably the highest mark ever reached. The Graduate Mem-
bership has also been materially increased. All active members of the
Society upon graduation and the payment of dues totalling $5.25, including
all dues paid while active members, become Graduate Members, exempt
from further dues, and are entitled to the Technic free. The Society
has published its revised constitution this year, and copies will be sent to
any who desire them. The Society over a year ago adopted a pin in blue
and gold, the design of which appears on the cover of this volume.
The Board desires to thank Professors Davis and Allen for their
advice. Mr. Hutchins of last year's Board also has rendered much
assistance, and the Faculty and alumni have helped in many ways.
It has been the aim of the Board to make the volume representative
of Michigan men and their work. Four graduation theses selected by the
Faculty from those of the last two years, and contributions from the
Faculty and from prominent alumni are included. Two of the articles,
those of Mr. White and Mr. Thorpe, were written for last year's number,
but were omitted for lack of space; they have been revised for this volume.
Two of the articles were sent in without solicitation. It is a great favor
for alumni to send in contributions or information regarding work which
other Michigan men are engaged upon. It is to a great extent impossible
for a changing board like the Technic Board to keep track of the work of
Michigan men, and the alumni can assist greatly in making the Michigan
Technic a more nearly representative publication.
Besides the Engineering Society, a new Electrical Society is in process
of formation. We have no doubt that its organization is partially due to
the appearance on our reading table of a monthly issued by the Electrical
Club, employes of the Westinghouse Electric Co., at Pittsburg.
We hardly need call special attention to our advertisers. Their names
must be recognized by all as among the most prominent in the country.
We ask you to look them over carefully and to bear them in mind. We
hope the index of advertisers will prove useful.

HERBERT CHARLES SADLER, D. Sc
PROFESSOR OF NAVAL ARCHITECTURE, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.
Professor Herbert Charles Sadler, an Englishman by nativity, a Scot
by adoption and by scientific training, was born in 1872. He enjoyed the
great advantages which usually follow from preparatory education at one
of the great English public schools. He was prepared at Dulwich Col-
lege, where he received an excellent classical and scientific grounding.
Although he graduated head of his division (the engineering) of the
school, he was no mere "bohner," for he played quarterback at football
and was prominent in cricket also. One incident, marking his early bent
towards the group of sciences in which he has since distinguished him-
self, deserves to be recorded. Just as Pascal worked at the problems of
Euclid for himself, having stumbled on an old text-book belonging to his
father, so Mr. Sadler pieced out his algebra without aid, and stimulated
by a similar discovery.
In these circumstances, the University of Glasgow was evidently the
place for him and thither he repaired. He graduated there as B. S. (B.
Sc. it is called at Scottish universities) in Naval Architecture twelve years


ago. During the summer vacations and after completing the university
course, he served a regular apprenticeship in one of the Clyde shipbuild-
ing and engineering establishments; in this way becoming familiar with
all the practical details of his profession. The latter part of his appren-
ticeship and several years following were spent in the drawing office,
where latterly he had charge of the more important calculating work.
In 1806 he was appointed Assistant Professor of Naval Architecture
at Glasgow University. In this capacity he enjoyed the inestimable ad-
vantage of being associated in private practice with Professor Harvard
Biles, the head of the Glasgow Department, one of the busiest and most
eminent naval architects of the day. Here the value of Professor Sad-
lr's practical experience in the Clyde yards made itself felt. A conspicu-
ous instance of this is to be found in the part he played on the occasion
of the recent stranding of the Paris on the Manacles. The survey of
the ship as she lay on the rocks was entrusted to him, and so well did he
execute his commission that arrangements were made between owners
and underwriters on the basis of his report, and a costly appeal to the
law courts averted. It is surely worthy of remark that a task so difficult
and so onerous should have been entrusted to so young a man. While
connected with Professor Biles, he collaborated with him in the design of
a number of vessels of all types, notably those of the American Line, and
some of the fastest channel steamers, as well as being engaged in many
admiralty law suits.
When, six years ago, the Board of Regents in consultation with the
Faculty of Engineering, decided to establish a Department of Naval Archi-
tecture, and began to search for a chief, they had to proceed with caie.
For, evidently, when a new departure of this importance calls for organ-
ization, everything depends upon the first head. His it is to create the
ideals and standards that will continue to rule in after years.
This being the situation, it is a piece of distinct good fortune for the
University and for the future Department that the Board was able to
command the services of a man who is eminent in his science, thoroughly
trained in theory and practice, and widely known to shipbuilders and na-
val architects, not only in Great Britain, but also in the United States.
Mr. Sadler came to the University of Michigan in the fall of 1000
and assumed his duties with the title of Junior Professor of Naval Archi-
tecture. In the spring of 1004 he was given the rank of full Professor.
In 1902 he received the degree of Doctor of Science (D. Sc.) from the
University of Glasgow, his alma mater.
Other honors have fallen to Mr. Sadler. He is a Past President of
the Glasgow University of Engineering Society. He has won the high
honor of membership in the Institute of Naval Architects in London.
He is a member of the Institute of Naval Architects and Marine En-


gineers in America, and of the Institute of Engineers and Ship-builders
in Scotland. The Scottish Institute has twice selected him for special
distinction. His investigation of "Light Draught Steamers" was awarded
a medal; and the same honor, this time in the "Senior Section" of the
Institute, was conferred on his investigation of the "Effects of Increased
Size of Steamships"—a most pressing question in these days of "Ocean-
ics" and "Deutchlands." Among his other considerable contributions is
one on the "Propulsion of Ships," while another deals with "Oil-carrying
Steamers."
Shortly after taking up his duties at the University of Michigan,
Professor Sadler was appointed appraiser of all vessel properties owned
by the railroads, in connection with the Michigan State Tax Appraisal.
He is engaged at the present time with Colonel Stevens of New York,
as consulting Naval Architect for the new line of Ferries to Staten Is-
land; and also acts in a consulting capacity to one of the New York firms
of Naval Architects.
The construction of the Naval Tank in the New Engineering Build-
ing has been under his supervision, as well as the design of all the appar-
atus connected with the same. This includes the traveller, dynamometer,
model cutting machine, and otheT minor details, most of which are being
built in the University Shops at the present time.
Professor Sadler also takes a great interest in yachting, and since
coming to this country has designed a number of pleasure craft and mo-
tor boats. He is a well known contributor to the proceedings of the var-
ious scientific societies to which he belongs, and his name often appears in
the periodical literature of his profession. His name is familiar wherever
his science is pursued.
Mr. Sadler through his attractive personality has become endeared
to his colleagues and his students alike.


TRANSPACIFIC LONGITUDES.
BY OTTO KLOTZ, U. OF M. C. E. '72, LL. D., F. R. A. S., ETC.
GOVERNMENT ASTRONOMER OF CANADA.
Theoretically the determination of longitude, or more strictly speak-
ing, the difference of longitude between two places, is simplicity itself.
Determine the local time at each place and compare the observing clocks
by means of telegraph line or cable, and, as the boy at school said, "If an
experiment be successful the result will be inevitable."
In practice, however, the matter is not quite so simple. Electricity
had been laying one ocean after another under tribute, besides all the
continents, until the world was enmeshed with its conductors, with but
on great bare spot—the vast Pacific ocean. This wide expanse of some
8,000 miles looked too formidable to financiers, as well as to cable engin-
eers. However, by the joint action of Great Britain, Canada, Australia
and New Zealand the British Pacific cable became an accomplished fact
on October 31, 1902.
By it the opportunity was offered of completing the first astronomic
girdle of the world. Canada embraced the opportunity and the writer
was placed in charge of the work. The cable runs from Vancouver Is-
land to Fanning Island; to Suva, Fiji; to Norfolk Island; and to South-
port, near Brisbane, Australia, wth a branch from Norfolk Island to the
north end of New Zealand at Doubtless Bay. The first section is about
a thousand miles longer than any cable hitherto laid, and requrred 600
pounds of copper and 340 pounds of gutta percha to the nautical mile.
It must be remembered that the speed, or practical efficiency, of a cable
of given dimensions varies inversely as the square of its length, so that
cables of different lengths, forming a system or unit, must necessarily have
different quantities of copper and gutta percha per mile in order to ob-
tain a uniform efficiency throughout.
Before starting on the expedition, the climatic conditions of the var-
ious stations were studied so as to arrange the programme accordingly.
Another observer was necessarily associated with me to observe at the
alternate stations. The greater part of the work lay in the southern
hemisphere where the dazzling Canopus and Eridenar and Alpha Cen-
tauri, our nearest stellar neighbor, hold sway. We were introduced to the
"Coal Sacks," or dark starless spots in the heavens, and to the fleecy Mag-
ellanic clouds, that star dust of the skies. But the Southern Cross cannot
compare with our Great Bear or Dipper. The most conspicuous absence


in the southern sky for the surveyor, explorer and navigator is a bright
star near the pole, like our Polaris. In Australia, the land of sunshine
and drought, of gold and sheep, of eucalypti and rabbits, of possibilities
and development, the astronomer finds a transparent sky; while in the
land of the Maori—New Zealand—across the ever restless Tasman sea,
the elements from the antarctics and tropics struggle with each other for
supremacy to the detriment of the star-gazer. Many months were spent
on the coral-ribbed islands resting in those blue waters of the South
Seas, where the natives dream life away, oblivious of the "strenuous life"
we have invented. Their astronomy and time-reckoning is based on no
solstices or equinoxes, but simply on the yam, their staple food. Among
these simple, gentle and cleanly people (Samoans) Robert Louis Steven-
son found rest. But I must not digress. Each observer was provided
with a similar outfit, the principal instruments being two portable as-
tronomic transits, besides chronographs and batteries. An observing hut
was built at each station and close to the cable office. The transits were
always mounted on brick piers, sunk at least three feet beneath the sur-
face. Being always near the sea-coast we had the phenomenon presented
of noticing daily, by means of the delicate striding level, the loading and
unloading of the coast and consequent bending of the earth's crust and
tilting of the pier, by the tides. Every clear night each observer would
obtain two independent time determinations from two sets of fourteen
stars each, seven being observed in the positive clamp east, and seven
clamp west. The probable error of time determination, that is, the error
of the chronometer, is about one hundredth of a second. By a special
attachment to the cable apparatus each observer could record automatic-
ally in ink on a fillet of paper, in terms of his clock, the signal sent into
the cable and received by the other observer, where it was recorded sim-
ilarly on a tape, on which also the clock there recorded its second-beats.
It is obvious that a signal sent from one station to another arrives at the
latter too late by the time occupied in transmission, so that a comparison
of the records at the two stations of the time exchange, each sending and
receiving a set of signals, shows a difference of twice the time of trans-
mission. This quantity was measured every night and with a probable
error of less than two thousandths of a second. The time of transmission
over the long section—over 4,000 statute miles—took a trifle over a third
of a second. This quantity may seem small, but in longitude work is
large. Good longitude work depends upon taking care of the small
things. Every man has his own peculiar make-up; his nerve system and
sense of preception are different from that of anybody else. This differ-
ence between two observers effects longitude. The man with sluggish
temperament puts a place too far west, to him the stars don't transit over
the threads in the telescope, until they are actually past. On the other


hand the nervous susceptibilities of another man may be so constituted
that the observer anticipates an event, imagines the star to be on the
thread when in fact it hasn't reached there, and thereby observes as if he
were in reality to the east of his true position, and by a quantity equal to
the "personal equation." To neglect this quantity, although only a frac-
tional part of a second ,would be to vitiate an otherwise good longitude
determination.
Fortunately the number of stations across the Pacific was odd, and
as they were occupied alternately by the two observers, the final values
for the terminal stations in Australia and New Zealand are free from
personal equation. The basal longitude hitherto for both Australia and
New Zealand had been brought eastward from Greenwich, the interna-
tional zero meridian, via Madras and Singapore, so that by joining that
circuit to the one across the Pacific completed on the 28th of September,
1903, the first astronomic girdle of the world, and furthermore showed
how well the astronomer could proceed step by step, ever determining his
distance from the zero meridian, Greenwich, until he met his fellow-as-
tronomer coming from the opposite side—and question his position on the
earth. The supreme moment had arrived. Is the east longitude of the
one the complement of the west longitude of the other? Will the girdle
fit, or is it too large or too small?
Thousands and thousands of miles of cable and land lines had been used
to transmit the pulsations of the clocks, many links had been forged to com-
plete the chain, many hundreds of stars had been called from heaven to
record their constancy, and skilfully the astronomer had welded the whole
into one structure. But no work of man is perfect; eternal vigilance is
the watchword of precision. When the longitude brought from the west
closed at Sydney, Australia, with that from the east the discrepancy was
less than a tenth of a second in time, which is equivalent to saying that
the one astronomer had given the distance in longitude from Greenwich
within about a hundred feet of the distance measured in the opposite
direction by the other astronomer. The two had started in opposite di-
rections around the earth to meet each other, traveling across seas and
continents, and finally find their respective trysting places within the
same area, not larger than an ordinary town lot. This was a measure of
the quality of their work. The world was girdled astronomically.


STRESSES EST A SPHERICAL DOME.
A. E. Greene, '96.
Assistant Professor of Civil Engineering, University of Michigan.
Let the semi-circle shown in Fig. 1 represent a meridian section of
a thin hemi-spherical shell of uniform thickness. As the area of a zone
of a sphere is equal to the circumference of a great circle multiplied by
the altitude of the zone, if a horizontal plane is passed through the dome
at a height h above its equator, the weight of the shell above the plane
is 2 t w R (R—h), w being the weight of a piece of shell of unit sur-
face. This weight presses vertically upon the plane of section with an
intensity per uni1. of length of
2 t u&gt; R (R—h)

and causes a tangential stress, T (=p0 per unit of circumference in the
shell. From similar triangles

The thrust, T, has a horizontal component H (= W from

hoop were put around the dome at the plane of section to resist the
horizonal thrust, the hoop would be subjected to a pressure of H per unit
of circumference, and the stress, S, in it would be the pressure into the
radius, the negative sign denoting tension.

THE OPPOTRUNITDES IN THE ELECTRICAL BUSINESS*
GEORGE A. DAMON, '95, MANAGING ENGINEER, THE ARNOLD COMPANY, CHICAGO.
The electrical business is a complicated one, and is constantly under-
going changes. By the time a method or system becomes standard
enough to be looked upon as a precedent, a tendency develops in some
entirely new direction. The men who succeed in electrical work must
therefore be quick to grasp the lessons of the past, must be ready to
appreciate the limitations of the present and above all should be alert to
seize the opportunities for improvement.
The leaders in the various branches of the industry during the first
developments when electrical work was an art and not a science, were
graduates, from the well known university of "Hard Knocks." The men
of the second generation of workers who are now doing things are largely
the product of a semi-scientific training in schools of technology, supple-
mented by experience of a practical nature picked up in a more or less
haphazard way. A« few years more will see the development of a third
and better prepared generation of electrical experts and it is safe to say
that they will be the result of a combination of a practical training thor-
oughly mixed with a theoretical education. As it must be expected that
the next generation will be superior to the present one, will it not be
well to stop for an instant in the strenuous rush for results and make
a few suggestions which may be of assistance to our successors in plan-
ning their life work.
"Work harder," "dig deeper," "put in a better cement foundation," are
the key notes of the suggestions which our older brothers give us as the
result of their experience, and the ambitious young man will be quick to
recognize the value of their advice. But what is wanted most is some
definite information as to how to spend the time devoted to preparation
in the most efficient manner, and how to get the benefit of a combined
training in theory and practice in the most effective way.
THREE INQUIRIES.
That those who have traveled well on their way toward their goal
will have many opportunities to point the way to the ones behind, is well
•An abstract of the paper presented at the first meeting of the Electrical Section
of the Western Society of Engineers, held March 18. 1804. Kor a copy of the complete

indicated by recounting several recent conversations. The first was with
a boy of eighteen.
"I am a Senior in the High School," he said, "and I want to become
an electrical engineer; what shall I do?"
He was strong, bright, ambitious and willing to work.
"Some men tell me to take a college course first and enter practical
work afterward; some tell me to get a few years' experience first and then
take a college course, while still others tell me to study several years, work
a year or two and then finish my Senior year. In planning my course
should I include the language studies or cut them out in favor of shop,
laboratory or commercial courses? Should I try to get through in three
years, or should I extend my college education over a period of five years?
Others tell me to leave out the university work entirely, go to work in
the shop or upon construction work, getting what theoretical training
require by attendance at night school or by taking a correspondence course.
What shall I do?"
And there are some of us who will appreciate the young man's
bewilderment.
The second conversation was with a professor at the head of the
electrical department of one of our leading universities.
"I feel highly complimented," he said. "I have received a letter from
one of the largest electrical manufacturing companies in this country,
offering positions to my entire senior class. This is remarkable, for m
Europe it is the custom for the technical graduates to pay for thfe privi-
lege of entering the shops of the large companies. But," he continued,
"I should like to find out whether or not I should advise my boys to accept
this offer. What has become of the young college men who entered the
shop courses in years gone by? Are they advancing as satisfactorily as
the graduates who found positions in other parts of the field? Have the
large companies taken care of the graduates of their testing departments
with sufficient liberality to justify a young man in making the sacrifices
which a shop course entails? Would it not be better all around if 1
offered the large company the services of my Junior class for one year?
What would you advise?"
The professor is to be commended in his search for information, and
in his evident interest in seeing his "boys" get a fair start in the stren-
uous race in which they have entered.
The third conversation was with a young electrical engineer who had
graduated from high school, had then taken a college course with some
practical work during vacations, and had then entered a large factory as a
"special apprentice."
"I have had a fine experience," he said, "and have nothing to regret.
Upon leaving college I went into the testing department of a large elec-


trical manufacturing company, was promoted rapidly, and finally advanced
into the engineering department. My compensation at first was small,
but it has gradually been increased until at the end of five years' service
I am receiving about $1,500 per year. I am looking out for the future,
however, and am not entirely satisfied with the prospect. If I stay with
my present employers, the manufacturing company, my work must be
narrowed to one department of the work, and I will always be a salaried
man without an opportunity to acquire an interest in the business. Would
it not have been better for me to have started with a smaller company,
and is it too late yet for me to begin over again? What would you
suggest?"
Knowing that the leading electrical men of Chicago would afford a
valuable field for studying results and would welcome an opportunity to
help furnish a solution for the problems of the boy, the professor and the
rising young electrical engineer, a letter of inquiry was sent to one hun-
dred of the leading men in Chicago engaged in the various branches of the
electrical industry. An opportunity was given at the same time for the
expression of opinion on various questions pertinent to the general sub-
ject. The response to the circular letter was hearty and spontaneous,
and we are under obligations to one hundred of our friends who have so
kindly consented to become living examples, and willing to be analyzed
for the good of the cause. The following is
AN ANALYSIS OF RESULTS.
Young men control the business. The inquiry was, therefore, con-
fined to men between the ages of 27 and 45, upon the theory that the older
men are the product of a set of conditions which have passed away, while
the youngest men are, as a rule, still engaged in a period of preparation.
The number of men of each age is shown graphically. The average age
is thirty-three and one-half years.
The hundred men may be divided into groups as follows:
Average Average
No. of men Age Income
Salesmen 7 33 $2,400
Sales Managers 11 36 3,4°o
Business Men 10 36 4,800
Sales Engineers 8 35 2,350
Elecrical Engineers 16 33 2,800
Constructing Engineers 6 33 2,850
Electrical Experts 8 33 3,200
Operating Engineers 3 32 2,250
Operating Managers and Superintendents. .10 34 3,55°
Professors and Editors 8 34 2,500
Patent Attorneys 4 32 4.000
Consulting Engineers 9 40 6,400
Total number of men, 100. Gen. Averages: age 33V2 years; income, $3,440.


Classified in reference to incomes, the record is as follows:
Men
Income over $10,000 per year 5
Income between $5,000 and $10,000 9
Income between $2,400 and $5,000 66
Income below $2400 20
Total 100
It is to be understood that the dollar is not the most desirable standard
by which to measure men individually, but looked upon as a class, a study
of the averages furnished by the inquiry is interesting and may be made
instructive.
Salesmen who have technical ability or possess engineering informa-
tion, as a rule, get better salaries than those who do not.
Add initiative and executive ability to the salesman's ability and he
becomes a sales manager with a still greater reward.
Enterprise and energy put the man in possession of his own business,
or often result in a partnership arrangement. A technical man without
the commercial instinct is only fairly well paid. Ability to develop new
methods or apparatus puts him in the expert class where the rewards
are greater and in proportion to his ability.
Routine work, such as operating, is the least remunerative work of
all. Operating managers and superintendents however, are very well paid.
The editors were classed with the professors as there were too few
to form a class with an average of their own.
The phenomenal development along all electrical lines, and particularly
in the telephone business, makes the profession of patent attorney a pay-
ing one for those who are qualified for that kind of work.
The field of consulting electrical engineering looks attractive, but
it will be noted that the average age is greater in this branch than in the
others, which means that the successful consulting engineer brings to his
work years of experience, and that it is therefore not a branch to be
adopted at once by the young man.
Forty per cent of the men in the list are employed by what might be
termed the "large" companies, such as the Western Electric, Chicago Edi-
son, Chicago Telephone Company, etc
Thirty-five per cent of the men either control the business in which
they are engaged or own a partnership interest.
Twenty-five per cent of the men are not college graduates.
Twenty per cent of this hundred successful men never had any college
education whatever.
The average age of the twenty men who are succeeding without a


college education is 36 years, and their success measured by a monetary
standard shows an income of $3,670 per year.
The average age of 16 graduates of Cornell is also 36 years, and their
success measured by the same questionable standard is $4,040, which
shows a balance of $1,270 per year in favor of a college education.
It will be noted however, that the twenty men without the education
are getting along financially slightly better than the general average of
$3440 per year. This is explained by the fact that in their number are
included several men who are prospering as a result of their business
enterprise.
There are few non-technical men engaged in the strictly technical
end of the business who reach the average income.
There seems to be more openings for the man without a college
training in the telephone field than in any other.
The answers to the questions upon which an expression of opinion
was asked resulted as follows:
Eighty per cent are inclined to think that a college education is es-
sential to the highest success.
Seventy per cent are in favor of the technical graduate taking a shop
course in a large manufacturing company, but many wished to limit
this course to one year.
Fifty-five per cent are of the opinion that in choosing a life work
better chances for advancement will be found with the smaller companies.
Seventy per cent are in favor of requiring a year's practical work of
the student before graduation.
Fifty-five per cent agree that the larger companies would be consult-
ing the interest of the art at large by offering an apprentice course open
to students during an intermission of one or two years before completing
the senior year.
OPPORTUNITIES.
Each of the hundred men included in the inquiry were asked to name
the three fields which he considered most promising within the immediate
future and the votes received are as follows:
Electric Railway Work 63
Telephony 36
Transmition 30
Electro-Chemistry 29
Power Applications 21

Storage Batteries 4
Reconstruction of Plants 3
Mining 3
Metallurgy 3
Turbines 2
Wireless Telegraphy, Designing, High Speed Telegraphy, Underground
Conduit Construction, Isolated Plants, Train Lighting and Munici-
pal Lighting, each I
As a result of personal observation, tempered somewhat by the opin-
ions of the electrical men, with whom the questions have been discussed,
the writer wishes to present the following conclusions:
A COLLEGE EDUCATION.
A young man wishing to succeed in any branch of electrical indus-
tries makes a serious mistake if he fails to use every effort to obtain a
technical education. A college course is becoming easier to obtain and
it is already recognized as a general requirement for advancement. A
young man of high aspirations, who is so situated that he cannot secure
a university course, might better, nine times out of ten, take up some
other branch of work which is less intricate than the electrical art.
Thomas Edison, the Dean of the profession, is not a college man, but a
gold medal bearing his name is to be given hereafter each year to the
college graduate presenting the best thesis, and this incident is the best
evidence of the present tendency toward technical education. Nearly
every man who is now making his way in the electrical business without
a college training, if asked what he would do if he had his life to live
over will say: "I would secure a technical course in the best college
I could find."
CORRESPONDENCE SCHOOLS.
A technical course in a correspondence school which can give the
proper training for an electrical engineer is yet to be produced. The
correspondence schools are doing a good work and are to be recom-
mended to those who cannot possibly avail themselves of a college course
or get instruction in evening school, courses such as offered by Armour
or Lewis Institutes, but a young man who will deliberately choose cor-
respondence instruction if anything else is available is making a serious
mistake. Of the hundred men in the list only two had completed a cor-


respondence course. These two men were engaged in telephone work,
and both voted in favor of a college course.
PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE.
Practical experience is as essential as theoretical training. Too little
attention has been paid by students in getting into thorough contact with
the way things are actually done. This is the result of the general prac-
tice of allowing the young man to shift for himself. "I can't get a job
without experience," he says, " and I can't get experience without a job;"
and then, more or less discouraged at the outlook, he takes the first open-
ing which presents itself ,and it may or may not be the kind of work
for which he is fitted. What is needed is a general clearing-house of
information, a closer union between the ambitious student and the suc-
cessful men who have been pioneers in the work. The electrical business
has now progressed far enough that the actual experience essential for
the highest success along any one of its various lines can be generally
indicated by experts familiar with the ground to be covered. It is time
therefore, to abandon a thoughtless and perhaps selfish attitude toward
the beginner and make some organized effort to map out the territory
which he must travel with guide posts and signs marked: "This Way
to the Front."
An association of thoroughly successful men should exercise some
supervision over the preparation of the coming generation. If it is true
that the art is suffering today from a lack of trained men ready to take
up and solve the problems which are all about us, what must we expect
of the morrow with its widening opportunities? The student branches
of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and the recently formed
Edison Medal Association are moves in the right direction, but only a
beginning toward realizing the possibilities. Considerable attention is
being given to develop the best technical course, but a college training is
less than half of an education. What constitutes the other half is a big
problem waiting for a comprehensive answer.
SHOP COURSES.
The policy of the large companies in offering apprentice courses and
opportunities for experience in their testing departments is to be com-
mended. This practice, as carried on in some cases, however, is to be
criticised. A representative of a large manufacturing company visits a
technical school, offering to give positions to all the members of the
Senior class; the professor is highly complimented at this remarkable
courtesy, and advises his students to accept. The "shop" course usually


covers a period of two years. The hours are long and the pay is small.
The "experience" gained by the student may or may not justify the sac-
rifice. "It depends largely on the man," In the meantime the large
company has a good opportunity to select the material which it requires
for its own use, and perhaps twenty-five per cent of the shop graduates
have reason to feel enthusiastic over the system; the others pass through
days and nights of discouragement, and many leave the shop with a
sense of failure, which is sure to have an influence on their future.
All men are not built alike. Then why grind them through the same
mill? Should not some selections of materials be made before the mills
are started, a sorting over made earlier in the process? Perhaps the
mills themselves could be made a little more efficient It does seem
possible that a commission made up of the broadest men in the profession,
some from the large companies and some from outside practice, could
do much toward improving the facilities and present systems for "getting
experience." On behalf of the students now in the colleges who have
still to face the practical problems, an appeal for help, information and
suggestions is made.
THE STUDENT'S PART.
The trouble with a great many young men is that they don't "find"
themselves early enough in life. They fail to realize the possibilities and
are not prepared to grasp their opportunities. Ambition, Aptitude, Prep-
aration and Hard Work are the stepping stones to successful attainment.
Let the ambition to excel be deeply seated and directed along the lines
of natural endowment; let the purpose be firm, and as day follows night
the preparation will be thorough and the man will be known by his works.
"If I had it to do over again I would pick out some definite line of work
suited to my talents and work like fury" is the advice of many successful
and even unsuccessful men. ,
The purpose of this paper is to encourage a general discussion, which
may be of some help in arousing the latent ambitions of the young men
who have not selected their life work, by showing them the boundless op-
portunities of an undeveloped science; to encourage the efforts of the
students in our colleges by presenting the results which have been attained
by their predecessors; to crystalize the sentiment in favor of a scientific
combination of theory and practice, and finally, to give an opportunity to
the men on the fighting line to point the way to their successors who must
come to the front prepared in every way, if they intend to take some
part in the phenomenal developments which are to be expected.
In order to direct the discussion along definite channels the following


is offered as a suggestion to a young man seriously considering engaging
in the electrical business:
A SPECIFICATION FOR SUCCESS.
In general—The purport and intent of this specification is to cover
the labor and material required to produce in complete working order
a man prepared to attain his own ideal of success in that branch of elec-
trical work which he may elect.
It is to be understood that the omission of the mention of small details
in this description does not obviate the necessity of their being furnished.
What is wanted is a thoroughly trained, well seasoned, broad minded
man, complete with an individual character, a strong intellect, and a sin-
cere purpose.
Plans—He will form his ambition early in life.
He will take a natural interest in the history of men of eminence
in his chosen work and their achievements will inspire him with a desire
to accomplish great things.
He will develop his imagination and constantly broaden his conception
of his own possibilities.
He will seek to learn what the world wants and then will endeavor
to train his natural abilities so as to supply that want.
Foundations—He will as a boy develop a knack of "doing things"
etiher as a mechanic, as a draftsman, or in some boyish business enter-
prise, and a combination of any two or all three proclivities is desirable.
He must early learn the advantage of doing some one thing well,
but he should not allow praise for his proficiency to encourage him to
neglect study along the lines he does not naturally fancy.
He will prepare for college and during this period of preparation he
will get enough experience in practical work to demonstrate that he has
made a wise choice for his life work.
He will not let the attractions of practical work interfere with his
intentions to secure the best theoretical and technical training the country
affords.
Dimensions—He will endeavor early to "earn money" by doing use-
ful work, and will seek employment outside of his study hours. Every-
thing he attempts he will complete to the best of his knowledge and
ability.
He will put himself on a self-supporting basis as soon as possible,
and will earn his own way through college. If he receives financial assis-
tance, he will treat it as borrowed money, to be returned, and he will keep
the debt within reasonable limits.
He will not allow any false sentiment "to finish with his class" prevent


him from stopping out one or even two yeaTs during his college course
to add to his store of practical experience along electrical or allied lines.
He will determine for himself whether he intends to realize on his
possibilities quickly or whether he will lay a broader foundation for a
slower but higher development.
Capacity—Even if the young man possesses only ordinary talents,
his capacity for hard, conscientious, intelligent, well-directed work will
attract attention and win advancement.
When the occasion demands he will be able to stand a long run on
overload or respond to excessive demands for short periods without per-
manent injury.
He will be able to direct others and will not depend entirely upon his
unaided efforts for results.
Operation—He will work quietly, and will be turning in the right
direction every minute in a simple, direct, and accurate way.
He will join that great army of workers who are actually doing things
rather than that smaller class of men who occupy most of their time
in telling what they are going to do.
Parallel operation—As a student he will enroll as a member of the
Student Branch of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and take
a lively interest in the Institute papers and discussions. In practice he will
advance to Associate membership and will look forward to the day when
he has added sufficient to the art to be considered worthy of Active mem-
bership.
He will make friends among his superiors, who will respect his ambi-
tious and will be glad to assist him in realizing his ideals.
He will study men and know how to deal with them.
Work to be done by others—Parents should study their children and
encourage them to develop their natural tendencies.
Teachers should get hold of their students personally and as far as
possible treat each case individually.
More occasions should be made for successful men to meet students
and give them the benefit of their advice and experience.
The students should not be isolated in a little world of their own,
but should be brought in contact with an atmosphere of actual affairs.
Above all, some method must be devised to guide the young man
to and through the course of practical experience best adapted to his
qualifications and purpose in life.
Shop tests—If he enters the shop or testing department of a manu-
facturing company, he will make a bargain which will result in his get-
ting an all around experience in exchange for his services, and, while
in the shop, will keep on the move in every sense of the word.


He will seek to make himself thoroughly practical in all his ideas
and methods of work.
Finish—He will include in his preparations considerable literary
work and will seek after a general culture. He will study at least one
foreign language.
He will regard his college work as only the beginning of his educa-
tion and will be a student always.
He will seek practice in the art of expressing himself, and will occa-
sionally write a paper on some technical subject.
He will become interested in some social, educational or reform move-
ment, and will avoid becoming a recluse interested only in his own work.
Inspection—During his Senior year he will submit a thesis in compe-
tition for the Edison Medal and even if he fails to get the prize his effort
will demonstrate his sincerity and will show the thoroughness and breadth
of his preparations.
Fittings—He will find it necessary to possess accurate knowledge
of nearly every branch of science, including physics, chemistry, math-
ematics, mechanics, pneumatics, hydraulics, mining, metallurgy, and civil
engineering.
He must know something about accounts and a great deal about
business and commercial law.
He will find that the electrical business is so broad in its scope that
a natural aptitude in any direction can be made of use.
Completion—He will make every sacrifice to get a thorough prepa-
tion and a broad experience up to the age of 28 or 30 years.
He will accomplish much between the age of 30 and 45, at the end of
which time he will be well settled in his business or profession.
Let us leave him at this time to inherit his own. May he live long
and prosper.
The following are some of the answers received in reply to one of a
set of questions sent to one hundred electrical men in Chicago:
Question.
In the light of our present experience, and under existing conditions,
what course would you follow if you had it all to do over again?
"I do not like engineering work, but like the engineering knowledge
as applied to patent law. I would thereofre devote the college training
to a combination study of Law, English, and Science, with particular
attention to electrical drawing and design and also chemistry."
"Same as I have, only dig harder when at college and later also."
"I would take the college course straight, spending one or two vaca-
tions in construction work, then go with one of the larger companies


for three or four years in testing and construction work, and then take
a year's post-graduate work."
"I would get my technical course early in some school where I could
be in contact with and imbibe as much of a literary training as possible."
"College, practical work in summer if possible, and if not, apprentice
course afterwards. At least two summers in some commercial business,
learning office methods and also how to approach men in business life."
"Get all the general education and practical experience practicable
before taking up the technical course; then make the most of that."
"Would connect myself with some large concern if possible for two
years following Sophomore year, then finish college. Then return for a
time to some large concern and get experience and prestige, then look
up best opening possible.
"Just as I did, i. e., a few years' practical work interspersed with
the college course, followed by a term in the testing department of one
of the large electrical concerns.
"Mechanical English, with electrical courses taken as specials.
"I would do just about the same as I did before, namely, get a good
school education, then serve an apprenticeship in some suitable shop,
acquiring theory in spare moments, and then go to college."
"Take the college course, and get all the practical experience during
vacations I possibly could."
"Work harder."
"Would enter testing department of large company immediately after
graduation from college."
"I should enter the employment of one of the large electric manufac-
turing companies to gain experience. Having gained which, I should con-
nect myself with a young and growing concern and try to secure an interest
in the business."
"Take a general engineering course, supplement with a brief law
course, get into the commercial side of the business, and aim to be a
'captain of industry.'"
"Take an M. E. course with as much elective work in electrical and
civil engineering as possible. Spend vacations with a surveying party
and in a shop. Extend course to five or six years if necessary to get the
amount of work stated."
"Take a university course followed by the practical experience in the
line which I specialized in at the university. Every young man should
as early as possible decide exactly the field of his future labors and in
addition the exact department of that field which is most congenial to
him and direct his education along the lines that will be of future service
to him."


"Make the utmost of my opportunity for advancement in a broad way,
and apply as much energy and vigor as is consistent with good health
and contingent circumstances."
"Do as I did before: Make the best of every opportunity as it presents
itself. Be an Individual."
"I should qualify the training I have been through by a course at the
very best technical college I could find on earth, but I would not give
the practical experience I have had for all the 'X+Y' I have ever been
up against."
"Think I would do about the same, excepting I would spend at least
two years in machine shop and on outside work—repairing and the like."
"Would not leave college until I had a very thorough training in
mathematics. Would spend some time in operating work and then go
into the draughting room and stay at least two years. Then into either
the operating or business side."
"I would recommend a young man to take the regular technical
course in the branch of engineering he intended to follow in one of our
leading State universities or Eastern colleges, and to follow this with
at least one year's work in the testing department of some large manufac-
turing company. Six months or a year of work in the draughting depart-
ment, would be a very valuable fitting for work either as consulting
engineer or in connection with any manufacturing or central station or
railway work."
"Mechanical and Electrical course in Technical School. One year at
practical work, between Sophomore and Junior year."
"I would take two or three years' practical work before finishing the
college course."
"I would prefer some practical experience in the line of my chosen
profession, either before or during my college course."
"I woudl take a thorough course in civil engineering and supplement
it by a couple years post-graduate work in electrical engineering."
"I would make a beginning where experience seemed the most likely
to be found, and would change every time something better offered,
rather than sticking in less desirable positions as many do. I would ad-
vertise myself legitimately and be more aggressive."
"Take a complete technical course and sandwich in a year's practical
work before graduation."
"I would take a course in mechanical engineering and take a post-
graduate course, or else during the time of mechanical engineering studies,
take up electrical work, and then enter some shops and get practical ex-
perience, after which spend at least two years drafting. A man may in
all probability at the end of that time be of some value to himself and
others."


"A college education first. Then find the kind of work most con-
genial to me and stick to it"
"Same as before. Plug for the engineering degree with emphasis on
the practical side rather than on the theoretical, then strike out in practice
along any acceptable lines."
"Would work for a year or two before entering college at any kind
of engineering work. Then four years of college, during which time I
would cover three years of the electrical course with extras in history,
literature, and languages. Then a year of work in the special field chosen
while at work three years before, at which time I would have studied
the various fields. Then the Senior year and a year more at post-graduate
work. If I had to work my way through college, all the better. Then
go out in the cold world and prove that you can be worth something."
"Same course, except a little more aggressive."
"I would put in a couple of years with one of the large companies
where I could get the largest amount of experience, regardless of remun-
eration."
"Take a little more outdoor exercise."
"Same broad general education from practical men in full sympathy
with the active world, at college rather than High School. Finish at
either. Good practical course. Finish. Then secure employment."
"Were I to begin again with an engineering career in mind, I should
see to it that my elementary education was made as perfect as possible,
not only in electric lines, but in the engineering lines of steam, hydraulics,
mining, and other lines of engineering work with which the electrical
business today is closely interwoven. After finishing my elementary
education, I should supplement it with practical information gained with
one of the large manufacturing companies in the line which I cared to
follow. After this I should let circumstancees determine whether I
should continue with this manufacturing concern or start in business on
my own responsibility."
"I would get with a smaller concern for a broader experience and try
to progress later by promoting some enterprise of my own."
"The one I have pursued, I think. Having to rely on one's own re-
sources, develops the faculties to a greater degree."
"First, I would keep more copious notes. Second, I would use every
effort to get stock in the conecrn with which I saw fit to identify myself
after completing my university course."
Non-Technical Men.
The following answers are of special interest as they were given
by men who have never taken a technical course.


"Take a special technical course in engineering, then start with a good
company."
"Get a college education interspersed with at least one year of practical
work."
"Take good common and high school course, then several years at
practical work, and enter a technical school knowing what points I wanted
to give special attention."
Spend all the money I could 'scrape' together for a technical course
in the best college I could find."
"Save more .study more, work more—Talk less."
"Would take a complete course in electrical engineering, then take
a year's work in the testing department of a manufacturing company."
"First, college education; second, go into the shop of a reliable man-
ufacturing company; third, avoid the shelf."
"Would get a college education and then three or four years practical
experience on the construction end of my profession."
"I would secure technical training."
"Avail myself through university training of the best there is pertain-
ing to the special art I had decided to follow. Look to my own efforts
and practical experience in detail shop and otherwise to elevate me to the
success I desire."
"I would, if I had made up my mind to pursue an electrical course,
take a technical education, if possible, in connection with a business one."
"School, shops during vacation, technical university, drafting room,
testing shops."
"Take a technical course not exceeding three years, get into the most
prosperous concern possible, doing a large variety of work, and work like
fury."
"Dig deeper and commence earlier."
"Apprenticeship with comparatively small concern to obtain general
idea of calling. College course, during which time obtain approximately
one year's practical experience. After course fit up with general knowl-
edge and then detail."
"I would obtain a thorough technical training, interspersed with per-
iods devoted to acquiring practical experience."
"Acquire both thorough technical and business education. Both are
equally important."
"Take an electrical and mechanical course, with a year's experince
between Junior and Senior years."
"I would work at practical work for two or three years and then go
to college. Lots of time in college is wasted for want of practical under-
standing."


SANITARY IMPROVEMENT IN THE WEST WING OF
JACKSON PRISON.
BY C. G. WRENTMORE, 93, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF CIVII, ENGINEERING,
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.
The principal features aimed at in the installation of a new block
of cells at the Michigan State Prison are, First—Added safety against
the escape of convicts. Second—Improvement of the sanitary conditions.
The first feature we shall speak of only incidentally in this paper.
The second involves the following changes:
1st. Increase in the volume of the cell.
2nd. Increase in the amount of light admitted to the cell block and
to the individual cell.
3rd. The installation of a system of ventilation.
4th. The installation of plumbing.
5th. The installation of an electric light system.
6th. The use of non-absorbent materials so far as possible in the
construction.
7th. Added protection against fire.
The number of convicts incarcerated at Jackson varies from 675 to
nearly 800. During the day these men are at work in the shop, on the
farm or in the Prison yard at their prescribed duties. During the night
they are housed in four blocks of cells, known as the east block, the
east wing, the west wing and the west block. Of these the east and
west wings which are adjacent to the central Adminisration building, are
the oldest; the west block, lying to the west of the west wing, is next
in age, and the east block, lying to the east of the east wing is compara-
tively recent
The east and west wings are built on approximately the same plan,
consisting of a prison room 50' wide, 225' long, and 40' in clear height,
and inside this room, a block of cells 22' wide, 190' long and approximately
28' high. This block consists of four tiers, each tier having two rows
of cells placed back to back, with 41 cells in a row, giving 328 cells in
the block. This block is entirely clear of the surrounding building,
having a corridor entirely around it. The individual cells are 3' 4* wide
8' long, and 6' 6" high. The block is built of brick and stone, the front
and end walls being of stone 2' thick, the partition walls of brick, and the
cell floors of stone slabs. The partition walls between adjacent cells
are 13" walls, and the main partition, forming the backs of cells is 2' thick.

Fig J, Sectional Plan.


The corridor surrounding the block is floored with stone flagging, and
this floor is 4' below the grade of the prison yard outside.
It is seen from the above that the individual cell has a capacity of
of 173 cu. ft. The new cell is S'A' in width, 9' in length, and 7' in clear
height, giving a volume of 376 cu. ft., or exactly double that of the old
cell.
The lighting of the west wing was extremely poor, being furnished
by 44 windows 5' x 10'. Of these six had been covered over by a dining
room building placed adjacent to the west wing, and the windows walled
up. Moreover, 28 of the windows are on the south and 16 on the north
side and the six windows walled up were on this north wall, so that the
lighting on the north side is exceptionally bad. The windows are ar-
ranged in pairs, one above another with about 8' of wall between the
upper and lower windows. The arrangement is shown in Fig. 5.
The grating over these windows is built of 2 x %" bars 6" on centers
in the upper window, and 5" on centers in the lower, rendering the open-
ings 4" square in the upper windows and 3" square in the lower. There-
fore, in the upper window 20/36 or 55% of the light area is cut off by
the grating, and in the lower window 16/25 or 64%. With the nineteen
pairs of windows, therefore, we have 693 sq. ft. of light area. These
windows have been remodeled by taking out the bar of masonry between
the upper and lower windows of each pair, throwing the two into a single
large window 5' x 22'. Over this will be placed a grating of basket
shape, as shown in Fig. 5, of 2xl/2" horizontal bars, 18" on centers, and
%" hexagonal vertical bars 4" on centers. If this grating were flat it
would cut off 25 per cent of the light area, but with the basket form it
reduces the available light space about 16 per cent, therefore with the 22
windows wc have a total light area of 1925 sq. ft. as against 693 sq. ft.
in the old windows; a gain of 178 per cent. This, however, does not
fairly represent the additional light because of the unequal distribution
in the old block. With the old windows the northeast corner of the
cell block or the cells facing north on the east end, received almost no
light at all, whereas with the change now made all cells will receive
direct light from the windows.
The door of the old cell was 18" wide by 6' high, set in the 2' stone
wall. The grated doors of the individual tiers vary somewhat as these
tiers were built at different times. For the first tier the bars are 1%"
x }i" set 3V2" on centers, giving an opening of 5.08 in every 25 sq. in.,
or 41 per cent of the door; so that a door 6'x i'A' had a light area of
3.69 sq. ft. In the second and third tiers the bars are l^"x^" set
314" centers, giving a clear area of 3.06 in every 10.58 sq. in., or 29 per
cent In the majority of cases, however ,the painting and inaccurate

work reduced the light opening to about 25 per cent; so that on these two
tiers the clear area of the door is from 2.25 to 2.40 sq. ft.
On the fourth tier were cast iron doors with iVt" circular openings
4* center to center, giving an available light area of 4.91 in every 16 sq.
in., or 31 per cent, making 2.77 sq. ft. of light area per door.
In the new cells the front has a grated opening 6'x3' 4", cov-
ered with a grating built of 2*x5^" horizontal bars 12" on centers and
%" hexagonal verticals 4" on centers. The outside of the balcony
is covered by a grating consisting of V/i"yCY-i" horizontals with
9/16" square verticals. The reduction by these gratings leaves an
equivalent of 12.85 sq. ft. of clear opening in the cell fitont
This opening is 354 times that of the first tier of the old cells and 5&amp;
that of the second and third tiers. If, therefore, we consider that 2.78
times the amount of light enters the building with the new windows
and the opening of the cell front is from zVi to sJ4 times as large as
before, the amount of light actually entering the cell will be from ten to
sixteen times as great as in the old block. In some portions of the block
the gain will be less than this and where the conditions were worst it
will be far greater.
The ventilation in the old block was provided for by eight openings
in the ceiling, about 4'x8', with 2" joists 6" on centers for a grating;
also a brick flue having an internal area of about 12 sq. ft, with a grated
opening at the bottom 20" x 24". The individual cell had no provision
for ventilation beyond that induced by the heat of the convict's body
through the grated door described above. The heating was accomplished
by means of pipe coils set on the outside walls.
With the new system heat is furnished by cast iron radiators, set
one underneath each window. The ventilation of the main room will
still be taken care of by the flue, the opening at the base being enlarged
to 2V2' x 3', and by openings in the ceiling similar to those in the old
block. The ventilation of the individual cell is provided by the fan sys-
tem, a steel plate fan with tempered coils forcing fresh air into the cell,
and a disc fan drawing the foul air out. The steel plate fan is set in a
small fan building on the north side of the main building, at about the
middle of its length, the intake being in the form of a flue rising 15'
above the yard level. The fan building forms the tempered air chamber
and the discharge from the fan passes through a brick duct underneath
the floor into the main distributing flues. The entire system of heating
and ventilating coils is under automatic thermostat control.
The new block is 22' wide, 187' long, and 37' 3" high, containing five
tiers of cells, two rows in each tier, with 34 cells in a row. These are
placed back to back with a 4' space or corridor between the backs of cells
to carry the plumbing and ventilating pipes. The main fresh air ducts

run in a trench at the bottom of this corridor and from these ducts a
riser is taken off at every n', each riser feeding by means of branches
twenty cells. The main ducts and the risers are so proportioned as to
gradually reduce the speed of the air from the fan to the register. The
vitiated air is drawn through a register at the floor by a similar system
of risers connecting with the main foul air ducts in the garret, discharged
into the disc fan chamber and thence through the roof. The system is
planned to deliver 2000 cu. ft. of fresh air per hour to each cell, with the
fans running at the slowest rate of speed of the motors, and to draw
out the same amount of foul air, and this can be increased, by speeding
up, to 3000 cu. ft. per hour.
In the old cell block the plumbing consisted of a galvanized twelve
quart bucket with a wooden cover, carried into the cell by the convict
at night and carried out by him when marched to breakfast in the morn-
ing.
In the new block an enameled iron lavatory with water supply and
a closet with low down tank, is placed in each cell. A push button self
closing valve operates each fixture.
In each cell is placed an 8 c. p. incandescent lamp. One half tier is
placed on each circuit and all circuits are controlled from a switch board
on the main floor of the building. The main corridors of the building
are lighted by incandescent lamps hung from the ceiling. Lights are
also placed in the corridor between the backs of the cells, in the fan
room, and in the garret. In the old block the corridors were lighted by
electricity, but the convict had only a kerosene lamp or candle in his cell.
From a sanitary standpoint a worse choice of material than that
made for the old block could scarcely be made. The brick and stone
were both extremely porous and it was practically impossible to keep
the cells fit for occupancy. During the summer it frequently occurred
that the odors arising from this block of cells were sufficient to render
life in the adjacent guard-room a burden to the officials who were forced
to remain on duty. The surroundings of a convict required to enter one
of these cells at six o'clock in the evening and remain in it, with its
filth and foul odors, for twelve hours, with no provision for ventilation
except such circulation as the heat of his body induced through the
grated door, were not calculated to promote a healthy physical, mental
or moral condition. It certainly was punishment of high efficiency, but
not of the sort that should be administered in any self-respecting or
decent community. The new cells with their steel walls and terrazzo
floors, as nearly nonabsorbent as possible, with sanitary plumbing and
forced ventilation, will at least give the convict an opportunity to keep
himself in decent sanitary condition. When the convict is removed


from the cell it can be washed down with the hose and thoroughly cleaned
so that his successor need not be exposed to disease.
As a means of securing fire protection as well as added safety against
the escape of convicts, the wooden ceiling of the old building was
removed and a steel ceiling substituted in the new block, extending over
the entire corridors. The ceiling of the block itself and the central
corridor between the backs of the cells is all of tool proof steel plate. The
ceiling of the fifth tier balcony is of 3/16" soft steel plate, and the ceiling
over the main corridors outside of the cell block of light steel plate. In
the case of fire, which can now occur only in the garret, the fuel supolv
will consist simply of the roof trusses and roof covering, and the block
is so protected by the steel ceiling that no difficulty would ever be exper-
ienced in getting the entire force of convicts safely outside. The moral
effect of the steel ceiling, in discouraging attempts to escape is also a
valuable feature.
The impression made by this block when compared with the adjacent
one in the east wing, which was built on the same general design as the
old block in the west wing, is somewhat striking. The object aimed at
in the entire design is not primarily to give the convict luxurious quar-
ters, but rather to provide a habitation consistent with cleanliness. When
this object is attained the function of the engineer gives way to that of the
Chaplain in raising the convict to the next higher level.


SOME FOREST INFLUENCES.
BY FIMBERT ROTH, '90, PROFESSOR OF FORESTRY, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.
The opinion that the forest exercises beneficial influence on the cli-
mate, and the distribution of water supplies is probably much older than
the Christian era. There is reason to believe that Homer's pleas for the
mountain forests were prompted by this notion. The same appears true
of the story of Erichthonios who is punished by hunger for having felled
a sacred oak in the groves of Ceres. Equally probable is the opinion that
the mythological relation of nymph or deity and tree had for its object
to stay the heedless destruction of the woods.
Roessig in describing the politics of August I, (1586) of Saxony calls
attenion to a clear appreciation of the influence of the forest on the well
being of a country. Among other things he says: "Frequently the for-
est protects the food supply of a district. It protects the fields against the
devastating (dry and cold) north winds, etc." Buffon 1739 says: "The
longer a country is inhabited the poorer in forest and the drier it gets."
In 1792 the administration of the Department Basses Alpes (Lower Alps)
reported: "The clearing of the woods progresses, large parts of the
mountain sides are bare, the smallest creeks have developed into torrents,
and several communities have lost their harvests, herds and even their
buildings by floods."
Humbold and other travelers brought together numerous observations
from countries like Spain, Italy, Asia Minor, North Africa and Assyria
where extreme conditions prevail today and where more or less authentic
records fairly prove that great changes have taken place, which in most
cases are described as partly or wholly due to denudation of former forest
growth.
During the 19th century when the advocates of forestry especially of
State forestry were pleading before the legislatures of the central Euro-
pean states, the beneficial influence of the forest on climate and water-
flow, as well as its great economic value in producing timber, was and is
today one of the stock arguments. And it is this great argument which
has led to the first steps in forest protection and rational treatment in our
own country, and has brought about the reservation of over sixty million
acres of forest lands by the federal government and of millions of acres
by different states. The influence of the forest then, whether fallacy or
truth, has proven a most important conception in political economy.
For convenience we may divide the consideration of forest influences
into:
(a) What are the influences usually ascribed to the forest.
(b) What are the factors which underly these influences.
(c) How much of these influences may we regard today as proven
knowledge or fair inference, and what portions remain as open questions.
Generally the forest influences are treated differently by different men
and in different localities. Generally, too, the difference of opinions in
this matter is largely due to a lack of clear statement of premises. Fre-
quently strong assertion without attempt of proof robs the reasonable por-
tion of the claims of their power to cnvince. In addition, and this is es-


pecially true of the controversy of latter years, the opponents agree that
the forest exercises certain influences, or has the power to do so, but dis-
agree as to the actual amount of such influence and its importance in the
household of nature. For it is here, as in so many controversies of this
kind, the defender claims too much, the opponent allows too little and
neither appears to notice that it is the proverbial last straw which breaks
the camel's back. But in forest influences more than in many other sim-
ilar cases it is the small additional help which the forest gives which
counts for so much. A mere handful of straw checks the "blow-out" of
sand in your field; a light brush shelter checks the dune; a light brush
cover protects the seedling plants against the killing wind and sun; the
go degree F. in the sun are painful while the 80 degree F. in the shade of
a single tree are quite tolerable, or even pleasant. It is the last few inches
of our last spring's flood which changed a "high water" to a flood and
cost Michigan millions of dollars in property. Similarly it is usually the
last few inches of low water stage which change the conditions from pow-
er enough to run the mill to a condition of shut down. The crops of
last summer in this vicinity did not suffer because there was no rain,
for such was not the case, they suffered because they had ndt quite
enough. A bit of protection against the drying winds might easily have
remedied this.
Ordinarily and originally, forest influences were supposed to consist
of beneficial modification of climate and water flow, though even in the
earliest expressions the beneficial action of forest on soil and the ability
of the forest to produce a valuable crop on poor lands, or lands not suited
for fields, was clearly added or involved. Accordingly we may say that
it was supposed that:
The forest modifies the climate, by increased rain fall or precipitation
generally, by equalizing the temperature, making a country cooler in sum-
mer or warmer in winter; and by checking the influence of wind and storm.
The forest regulates the water supply, producing a condition of more
water, less flood, steadier stream, and more soil moisture. In this way it
was believed that the forest makes the land more hospitable, pleasant and
healthful, and assists agriculture, navigation and manufacture.
And it was also held that the forest improves any soil, and its help
is necessary on poor lands to produce any crop at all.
While the form of this belief has been modified and the stress is laid
more and more on the things which may be proven or at least fairly in-
ferred, the above three points still cover the matter of forest influences.
Formerly it was chiefly the increased rain fall which made the forest
appear important to the state. Today it is realized that its value in the
regulation of water storage and water flow, and its power to improve poor
soils and to utilize the poorest of soils, amply justifies the care which the
people of nearly all civilized states bestow on the protection, improvement
and extension of the forest.
For centuries the claims of forest influences were based on observa-
tions and interpretations of extreme conditions. The misery of Asia Minor,
the aridity of the lands of Babylon and Nineveh were ascribed to timber
denudation. But about the middle of the eighteeth century, scientific men
no longer content with these unproved assertions demanded exact study
of this great question and the principal factors underlying the same.
Stations were established in France, Germany, Austria, Sweden, to
study forest influences. These were usually double stations, one inside of
the forest, the other in the open field, but in some cases regular "radial


stations," or series of stations were established to note just how far the
influence of the forest might be felt. The observations were mostly ac-
cording to the programme of Regensburg and involved: Temperature of
air and soil, rainfall and humidity. Generally the study of water flow and
evaporation which were also included in the programme required special
methods and facilites.
After half a century of observations it is fair to say that in the
old settled states mentioned and as far as these observations go,
there falls as much rain and snow on the open fields as in the
forest, and the air in a box (properly shaded) hung up in the
open field is no warmer than the air in a similar box similarly shaded in
the forest. That the shaded air in the forest should be as warm as the
non-shaded air over the open field was never claimed, and the results
seem to indicate that the real and measured difference between the air in
the forest and that outside of the forest amounts to about the difference
between the temperature in shade and in the sun, disappearing, of course,
during cloudy weather and at night.
Similarly the air in the German forest is generally found no more
humid than the air of the neighboring field.
The study of the waters of the soil and streams which were made to
ascertain the influence of the forest did not lead to results at all satisfac-
tory. Their interpretation was usually based on premises which were by
no means beyond dispute. The measurement of two streams, one from a
heavily wooded, the other from a poorly timbered basin, might show con-
siderable differences, but usually peculiarities of topography, natural and
artificial drainage lines, rock and soil conditions would make the results
seem doubtful if not valueless. For this reason experimenters like Wollny
and Biihler long ago conceived the idea of subjecting this entire mat-
ter to experiment. They used large boxes filled with earth of definite uni-
form quality and stocked some of these with miniature forests of small
size trees of different kinds.
Before discussing the results of these experiments it will perhaps be
well to consider a few fundamentals which enter into the study, and for
which a simple illustration is here repeated.
If we take a table, prop up one side to represent a hillside or slope;
pour water on this table with a sprinkler to imitate rain, we see that the
water runs off about as fast as poured on, the faster the steeper the slope.
Now this is exactly what happens on a bare rocky slope and very nearly
what happens on a steep slope where the ground is hard and bare. We
have here nearly all of our precipitation in the form of "surface run off."
If now we cover the table with a six inch layer of earth and repeat
sprinkling, taking care not to sprinkle too hard, we note that at first nearly
all the water sinks into the soil. Soon however we have little rivulets
which gather into larger ones and there is again a surface run off, but
restricted to certain drainage lines or streams. But soon there is a gather-
ing of the water which has soaked into and through the layer of earth and
is pouring into little streams flowing along the surface of the table itself,
but underneath the layer of earth. This is our "underground run off."
If now we stop sprinkling, the surface run off stops quite promptly, but
the underground run off continues for hours. The layer of earth forms
a storage ground for the water in which the waters slowly gather and
form into underground streams whose flow continues long after the
sprinkling or precipitation ceases. It is evident that the deeper the layer
of earth the more water it can hold. Also that the softer the earth the


easier the water can soak in and the more will soak in and conribute to
the underground stream instead of running off at the top as surface run
off. It is clear that this experiment reproduces what is going on all over
the land.
If now we resume the sprinkling, but sprinkle with more force, we
see the water gathering in the surface rills, carrying off more or less of
the soil, and thus gradually washing out or carving gullies which grow
in depth and width, the faster the water flows and the more water is sup-
plied. Soon these many gullies help the surface run off so much that but
little soaks into the soil, doubly so since the harder sprinkling also tends
to pack or harden the general surface of the layer of earth.
But this again resembles what goes on all the time on the earth's sur-
face and thousands of acres of our western "brakes" and "bad lands" have
an appearance as if they had been carved chiefly to illustrate this phase of
soil physics.
It is especially interesting at this point to note how the trouble itself
increases the power to do mischief. The more the land is carved, and gul-
lied, ditched and plowed, the swifter the water runs off and the more car-
ving or eroding it can do.
If now we cover the layer of earth with moist cotton batting, or some
other similar material, we find that the soil does not erode as it did before,
and also that it does not compact by the spray of water, but that again
there is an ample soaking in of water, an underground run off.
But there is another important fact developed, namely that this cover
of cotton batting hinders the surface run off very materially and thus gives
the water all the more chance of soaking in. That a cover of growing
grass or other vegetabtion could do the same service is at once apparent,
and it is at this point where the influence of a live vegetable cover enters
into the problem.
That there is a certain loss of water by evaporation throughout this
experiment, and that this occurs in nature during every rain as well as at
all other times is self evident.
Generally then the water precipitated as rain or snow is either evap-
orated at once, runs off at the surface, or soaks into the ground and is
there stored and slowly finds its way into spring or creek as underground
stream. This storage of water in the ground, which, to man is one of the
most vital phenomena is, as far as our experiment indicates the greater,
the more water offered, the more gentle and even the sprinkling or pre-
cipitations, the softer or more accessible the soil and the thicker the layer
in wheih storage can take place, and the slower the surface run off, either
through lack of fall of ground or through actual obstacles, such as rough
surface, quantities of debris, or growing plants.
Returning to the experiments of Dr. Wollny and keeping in mind the
foregoing it is interesting to know that the results of these experiments
which well deserve to be called final and conclusive, fully agree with the
above conclusions and differ only in so far as a live vegetable cover,
whether grass or forest, differs radically from a lifeless cover assumed
before.
Briefly some of Wollny's results were as follows:
i. The erosion is hindered by a vegetable coyer. At an angle of 20
degrees there is over thirty times as much erosion or material washed
away per square foot from bare soil than from the same soil covered by
a sod of growing grass. Since erosion depends upon surface run off, the
above is also a measure of this run off.


2. The soil under a cover of trees is no moister than the soil of bare
land. A large average gave results indicating that the soil covered with
the miniature forest was even dryer.
3. The forest litter if only one inch thick protects the soil against
evaporation of water, so that bare soil evaporates three to five times
as much water as soil covered by such a layer of litter.
4. The percolation or soaking of water in and through the ground
was not helped by the vegetable cover, but was even hindered.
5. There is much more evaporation of water from land covered by
a vegetable cover than from bare land and the forest cover in this respect
is worse than a short lived cover of grass.
The forest tree is a consumer of water like every other plant, and the
faster it grows and the thriftier it is the more water it needs and uses and
sends up into the air as vapor. That this evaporation consumes heat and
tends to cool the atmosphere is a simple matter of physics.
Years of careful, well controlled experiments demonstrate then that
any live vegetable cover, but notably a forest strongly influences the fac-
tors which determines water storage and water flow. The run off and
with it the erosion is reduced, and thus by far the most important factor
in the entire process is affected in favor of water storage.
Comparing now the conditions we actually see and meet in the for-
est with the conditions of the experiments it is interesting to note that
the experiments are quite fair, but that some very important conditions,
evident in nearly every good forest and especially in our wild woods, are
not well reproduced in the experiment.
Examining the wild woods from this standpoint we see:
A collection of plants 60 to 100 feet tall forming a gigantic brush-
shelter on huge columns, with the ground peculiarly uneven, strewn with
debris and often densely covered with the smaller growth of shrubs and
young trees.
The soil as well as the layer of air fifty or more feet deep is shaded.
On a hot sunny day this soil and layer of air are affected as things in the
shade and not as things in the open, so that they are cooler by several de-
grees, a condition which effects plants and animals in a marked degree,
and also diminishes the shelter capacity of the air.
The air is quiet. This huge brush shelter, like any artificial shelter
of the same size and quality, retards the movement of the air. The effect
of a hot, dry wind is lessened, the cooler air stays, the soil remains moist,
the sensitive kinds of plants survive.
In winter time, the sudden thaw, nearly always a warm wind with
rain, is checked by this huge shelter and while the snow on the prairie is
fairly "eaten" by the Chinook, the snow of the forest is protected and
holds out much longer, often but a small part disappearing with the thaw.
That this affects high water and the flood is clear. While the snow on our
field is piled up along the fences and in the gullies as if made ready for
a rapid surface run off, the snow in the forest is distributed evenly and is
protected against wind and sun alike.
The soil is uneven. Every stump and tree is on an eminence with de-
pressions between. To be sure, this, as several other points very with soil,
lay of land and even with species. But generally the soil is uneven and
in most of our Michigan flat land woods one can see large amounts of
snow or rain water stand in puddles gradually soaking into the ground
without any marked increase in surface run off, and consequent flood or
high water.


The soil is softer in the forests than on bare land such as prairie, pas-
ture or long time burned slash lands. This particular feature has generally
escaped the experimenter and yet any one at all familiar with the woods
has observed the difference. Live and decaying roots are met everywhere,
and often form 10% or more of the upper one foot layer of soil. All through
the soil there is an abundance of vegetable matter and a constant working
over of materials by bacteria, by higher plants and animals. That
the rain water follows the many channels of decaying roots and
finds it easier to soak into such mellow forest soil appears fair inference,
in spite of the failure of Wollny to find this under his small miniature
forests.
The soil is protected by a mulch of decaying leaves. Exceptions to
this occur, but they are restricted to peculiar forms of forest, arid regions
or localities where man and fire have begun their work of "improvement."
The value of this mulch is well brought out by the experiments referred
to and is apparent to anyone. Under the mulch the material is damp even
weeks after rain.
The soil is frequently free from frost and accessible to water in win-
ter when the soil of the fields is frozen solid and therefore impervious.
Large quantities of debris, decaying logs, limbs and twigs cover a goodly
part of the ground in our wild woods. All this material soaks up water,
holds water better than the soil, offers mechanical resistance to the run
off of water, and adds to the shelter furnished by the forest.
A small shower in the forest barely reaches the ground, of all the
water precipitated by a half hour's shower of moderate force probably
not 50% would ever reach the ground. Rain gauges under trees in ex-
periments have recorded 20-50% less water than others located near by
but outside of the forest. But evidently such figures have little value, for
in a long continued rain o fa week's duration this loss is practically zero,
while in the half hour shower it may be near 100%.
A heavy rain fall of four hours in a forest "wets things down," but
unless it is steep slope country there is no rush of water in the little
creeks. A rain of the same character here about Ann Arbor transforms
the little streams like our Mill Creek into a muddy torrent, in which hun-
dreds of loads of the most valuable soil of the farms are sent into Huron
river and thus permanently lost.
A three days rain makes the Brazos river at the Double Mountains in
western Texas an impassable yellow torrent. This flood subsides in about
the same number of days so that the teams camp and wait to ford. A
three days rain on the upper Wisconsin does not swell the river. But
high water on the Wisconsin river is not a five days affair but can be de-
pended upon for two months log driving or rafting.
The fact that the forest materially and beneficially affects the soil is
no longer disputed. But while it is one of the most valuable features and
one of great immediate economic importance, a feature worth many mil-
lions of dollars every year, yet it is usually left out of the consideration of
forest influences.
The action of the forest in this direction may be summed up about
as follows:
The forest trees draw up the mineral salts, serving as plant food,
from a greater depth than corn or wheat, etc.
The forest like the good farmer returns to the soil nearly as much as
it takes of this plant food and spreads it every year over the ground in
shedding its leaves. The forest furnishes ample vegetable material to


keep the soil in fertile condition, keeping it more moist and mellow. By
adding this organic material the forest encourages bacteria fungi, insects,
etc., which help in working the soil and improving its condition, hastening
even the disintegration of the mineral constituents. Keeping the soil more
mellow the forest makes the soil more pervious to water and thus also
improves its moisture conditions.
The forest protects the soil against erosion, against sun and wind, all
recognized enemies of soil fertility.
While this reasoning seems of little importance to the farmer in Iowa,
located on the richest of land, it is of great importance in our Lake State
pineries and in the vast stretches of poor sand along the Atlantic and
Gulf. The capacity of the forest to use and improve lands not otherwise
of value will mean millions of dollars per year to our Lake Region alone
and offers the only reliable means at present to utilize millions of acres
of land denuded waste and unproductive for many years past.
If now we ask ourselves: What do we know concerning the influence
of the forest; what may we fairly infer and what is still doubtful ground,
it is clear from the foregoing fragmentary statement that the strong belief
in these influences on the part of the people at large and especially our
western people is quite well based.
Demonstrated experimentally; fully borne out by all careful observa-
tion, quite generally conceded and commonly applied in practice is the fact
that the forest trees hold the soil, prevent erosion, and retard the run off
of water. The common use of willows along dams and dikes, the cover
of steep slopes with alder and other forest growth; the cover of Alpine
slopes by the French government all indicate the general agreement on this
point. Similarly the gullying of probably over 10% of all upalnd farm-
lands of Mississippi clearly prove the opposite or the effect of denudation,
and the same is true of thousands of acres of land washed into gullies
right here in southern Michigan.
Equally well substantiated and for centuries known to the forester
and extensively employed in the agriculture of certain mountain regions
is the fact that the forest maintains and improves the fertility of the soil
and is so far the only reliable agent to cure and improve certain classes
of run down lands. Equally well substantiated is the influence of the forest
in moderating the effects of winds. This too is a matter of simple
and especially of late extensively employed on our western plaiifs.
In Manitoba it is now claimed that a shelter belt protects a crop
of wheat noticeably for a distance of fifty feet for every foot in height of
the trees.
Similarly it is not disputed and is generally observed as well as meas-
ured that the flow of prairie streams is radically different in character
from that of streams from timbered areas of about the same topography
The extensive and faithful observations of the U. S. Geological Survey
amply demonstrates this fact—that flood and drouth regularly alter-
nate in the streams of prairie and arid land districts, while the streams
from timbered areas present a more uniform flow and normally lack the
mischief bringing extremes.
To the above hundreds of general observations might be added.
Perhaps no place in the world was better suited than Michigan to supply
valuable information on this point. The southern countries were largely
swamp-dotted forest of which the surveyor ioo years ago stated it was
unfit for human habitation or settlement. Ague was common; corduroy
roads were universal. The clearing of the land, letting in wind and sun,


was the simple method of drying up our land, for no one would seriously
argue that if the forest had been left intact, the few ditches and lines of
pigmy tiles would ever have made any impression on the moisture con-
ditions of this wilderness. At the present time, every year miles of cor-
duroy road are abandoned and thousands of acres of swamp are changing
into plough lands without tile or ditch.
Concerning the influence of the forest on the climate particularly on
temperature and rain fall, there remains great difference of opinion. The
matter is still an open question. As has been pointed Out the stratum of
air in the forest and with it the soil and the plants enjoy the shade of the
huge brush cover; of this layer it is fair to claim what has been stated
above, namely that in sunny weather the forest air and plants and soil en-
joy the temperature of the shade instead of the temperature in the open
field or prairie. That the evaporation of water from the trees consumes
heat and being greater than that of a prairie area, would tend to cool the
forest and air about the forest is beyond dispute. That this influence is
of value and felt especially by the more sensitive plants and animals is be-
yond doubt, but that it should make itself felt in the general climate of
the region must remain uncertain and is certainly not a proven fact. And
plete removal of all forest cover of Germany, for instance, would remain
without appreciable effect on the temperature phase of its climate. How
much more this is true of arid and semi-arid forested regions one needs
but to think of parts of the Rockies and the west.
As to the rainfall we are still where we were fifty years ago. The
difficulties of exact measurement alone involve sufficient error of observa-
tion to probably obscure the influence which the forest may have in this
direction. But while there is nothing proven, nothing generally conceded,
it is difficult to give up the thought of some influence here. A local show-
er here in the Lake Region may well be supposed to precipitate some of
the moisture evaporated from lake, swamp or forest of the neighborhood.
If this be true, then water storage, extensive evaporation from forest
areas should be credited with at least a part of our local showers and thus
the forest be credited with some influence on precipitation. And there
certainly is much probability in the suggestion of Judge X, of Alturas, Cal.,
when he said, while watching the clouds coming from the west and fading
into the endless blue of the Nevada desert, "Suppose these mountains
(Warner range) were entirely bare, don't you suppose that this continu-
ous sunshine would heat them until the clouds would all pass over with-
out shedding a drop of water?" This same thought is expressed by Hum-
bold in his Kosmos, and is a thought quite universal among people who
have had a chance to compare.
But, it will be asked if so in many essential points of forest influences
are thus proven and conceded, why is there so much controversy?
The reason is this: These influences are clear and beyond doubt
qualitatively, but not so quantitatively. "All true enough, but it does not
amount to anything," is the common phrase of the opponent. And here
lies still the cause of dsagreement. Millions of observations on rainfall,
on temperature and humidity of air and soil in forest and field have done
practically nothing to demonstrate any marked influence in this direction.
Experiments, observations and measurements have demonstrated that
the forest improves the soil and affects water storage and water flow.
As to the improvement of the soil controversy has ceased. Even though
the matter can not be stated in simple figures we are agreed that it is
enough to be of enormous economic importance. Governments and pri-


vate people alike are willing to undertake large operations of restocking
poor land with timber on the assumption of the quantitative value of this
form of forest influence. As regards water storage and water flow we
are still more or less disagreed. While exact experiments on a small
scale demonstrated qualitatively the relative value of the different factors
entering the problem and while they thus prove the important influence of
the forest cover, it appears to be beyond these experiments to furnish
mathematical expressions which could be applied to the field. This is but
natural. The problem on the swamp-dotted flat pinery sands of the
Lake Region can in no wise be compared to the problem of the mountain
districts of Pennsylvania or the West. The amount and distribution of
precipitation, topography, soil, rock, prevalent winds, general tempera-
ture, species of trees and consequent character of the forest all tend to
complicate this problem.
Measurements of streams of well- and poorly forested basins
abroad have not helped in this matter. Measurements of the Ohio, Wis-
consin and other Istreams, and the attempt to prove historically a
change for the worse in their flow, flood and low water conditions were
but little more satisfactory, though to one who has lived through these
changes, has seen the Wsiconsin change from a navigable river into its
present condition these changes are powerful argument. The measure-
ments of prairie, arid land and forest streams by the U. S. Geological Sur-
vey in our country have done more and have at least pointed out even
Quantitatively the wide difference between the character of the flow of
these streams. An address by J. B. Lippincott of the Reclamation Ser-
vice of the U. S. G. S. at the Forestry Congress at Washington, Jan. 1905
brought out these facts most convincingly.
But when the question is asked: How much difference will it make
whether we go on and clear our lands or leave 25% of the area in woods?
we are still without a reliable, even approximately accurate answer. That
it will make a difference, we all know and concede; but how much we do
not know and probably never shall. The complications are too numerous,
the factors too large. A few have been indicated above. A river basin,
today covered by timber, but cleared during the next five years, will not
take on a settled water storage condition at once. For years the benefit
of a forest cover will continue to be felt. In many places, such as parts
of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, the clearing and partial drying of the
land was a benefit, was necessary to make the land hospitable. So the
question is one of immediate local conditions.
For southern Michigan it is safe to say that by denudation of forest
by cultivation of land, by ditching and drainage, we have reduced the
water stored in the land and have increased the surface run off to an ex-
tent which has affected the general welfare of our people. By the same means
we have encouraged erosion which has cost us thousands of acres of good
land by gullying and has injured by surface washing many thousands more.
We have encouraged the sweep of drying winds and thus lost in our agri-
cultural crops sums which no one is in position to estimate, though the
loss is universally acknowledged and its immediate cause conceded. The
individual farmer, the business man of the town and city, the railway, the
town, county and state all are losers, and the latter the greatest loser of
all. Its loss counts up by millions of dollars per year, and not merely for
today and tomorrow, but for all time to come. The individual can not
and will not correct the trouble, the state alone can. Will it see its oppor-
tunity and its duty?


INDIRECT RADIATOR TESTS.
FROM THESIS OF D. R. FRASER, JR., '04, AND C. D. BRADSHAW, '04.
Indirect radiators are steam radiators located in air flues supplying
hot air for heating purposes instead of direct radiation. They furnish
the ventilation which direct radiators do not, and at the same time can
heat rooms at a greater distance from the furnace than in an ordinary
hot air system. They can be used in public buildings where for any
reason it is not desired to install a fan system. Examples can be seen
on the University Campus in the University Hall, Old Medical Building,
Old Engineering Building, and several others. Indirect radiators are
especially useful in central heating systems located in the older residence
districts. Wherever a hot air furnace is displaced, a battery of indirect
radiators in a suitable chamber can make use of the same flues as before.
Conditions of tests—The object of the tests made during the winter
of 1903-4 was to investigate the performance of these radiators under the
varying conditions of steam pressure, and temperature and velocity of
entering air. The pressures used were 5 lbs. and 15 lbs. above atmosphere.
The temperature of entering air ranged from 13° to 60°. The quantities
of air ranged from 10,000 cu. ft. per hour to 27,000 cu. ft. per hour.
Radiators—Two radiators were tested.
1. The Perfection Pin Radiator, standard sections, jY2 inches deep
with conical pins lA inch long, furnished by the Michigan Radiator and
Iron Manufacturing Co., of Detroit. There were ten sections of 10 sq.
ft. rated surface each, measuring 7.72 sq. ft. actual surface each.
2. The Sanitary School Pin Radiator, sections 14 inches deep, with
pins lJ4 inches long, furnished by the American Radiator Co. There
were five sections of 20 sq. ft. rated surface each, measuring 16.37 sq. ft.
each.
The Perfection radiator was tested first. After an equal number
of tests had been run on the Sanitary radiator, it was decided that the
field of investigation was not being covered, and the tests were extended.
Apparatus—The apparatus is shown in fig. I, and was originally
installed by Messrs. E. D. Lyon and E. Collins in 1897, and was situated
in the pattern loft on the third floor of the University of Michigan
Mechanical Laboratory, immediately under the roof. A blower placed
in a small room with an eastern window forced cold air through the
apparatus. Warm air might also be drawn from the building and was
used to keep the entering air at a constant temperature while that outside


was dropping. The blower was motor driven and its speed was subject
to control. From the blower the air passed through a sheet iron receiver
box and a flue to the radiator box. The hot air flue discharged just
below a ventilator in the roof, and the hot air passed out of doors. The
apparatus with the exception of the receiver box was constructed of Y\
inch matched boards, and all but the fan room was lined with tin. In
addition the radiator box and hot air flue were covered with heavy paper
to decrease the radiation losses. A globe valve throttled high pressure
steam to the required degree, and was found to give more even pressure
than a reducing pressure valve. After throttling the steam passed through
a separator to the radiator, and the drip from the separator was left
open to prevent the accumulation of any moisture. The condensation
was collected in a trap and passed through cooling coils to the weighing
tubs. All steam piping was well lagged.
Instruments—All instruments were carefully compared with Univer-
sity standards throughout the ranges used. Two thermometers were
used wherever possible. Shields were placed on the air thermometers
to protect them from radiated heat.
Method of Testing—Most of the tests were made at night because
of greater freedom from variation in surrounding conditions. After the
apparatus had been started up with the desired steam pressure, velocity
of air and temperature of entering air, it was allowed to run from an
hour to an hour and a half until everything was constant before any read-
ings were taken. A half hour run was then made, the instruments being
read every five minutes. During the half hour the drip was drawn off
steadily into the weighing tub maintaining the water at a fixed level in the
steam trap. Usually three consecutive half hour runs were made under
the same conditions.
COMPUTATION FOR QUANTITY OK AIR PASSING.
All computations were made with five, six or seven place logarithm
tables and checked. From the temperatures of the entering steam and
drip, the number of B. T. U.'s given up by one pound of steam was found
in Kent's steam tables. This multiplied by the number of pounds con-
densed gave the total B. T. U.'s supplied by the steam. The steam was as-
sumed to be dry and saturated on entering the radiator. Corrections were
made for heating the cold air entering before reaching the radiator,
and for radiation losses from the upper part of the radiator box and the
hot air flue, the amounts per degree difference in temperature of the air
inside the apparatus and the room having been determined by experiment.
The heat units received by the air divided by the increase in temperature
and by the specific heat of the air gave the pounds of air passed, which
for better analysis were reduced to cubic feet per hour at 70°F. and 29.92
in. mercury.

COMPUTATION OF EQUATIONS FOR CURVES.
It was found that all the tests on each radiator could be plotted to-
gether with the coordinates—Cu. ft. air per hr. and B. T. U.'s per hr. per
degree difference between average temperature of air and steam. The
curve thus found (see curve sheet No. i) was assumed to be of the form
expressed by the equation x=Kyn. By computations from the results of
the experiments, the equation x = .0S039y •"* was obtained for the San-
itary Pin Radiator where
x=cu. ft. air per hr. per sq. ft. actual surface.
y=B. T. U.'s per hr. received by the air per degree difference in tem-
perature of average air and steam per sq. ft. actual surface.

Tests No. 81, 82 and 83, not being checked by other tests at the same
low air velocity, the curve was recomputed omitting these, and the value
x=.0582y •"* was obtained. Down draughts in the hot air flue were
noticed at times and were of course more prevalent at low velocities than
at high. These would tend to lower the temperature for the leaving air,
which by the method of computation would give too high values for quan-
tity of air passing. Correction for error of this nature would bring the
three tests discarded nearer to satisfying the last equation.
The Perfection Pin Radiator gave the equation x=.0207y :"* for all


the tests. This is the value plotted on curve sheet No. I. Aiter plotting
the data on the various other curve sheets, it was decided that there was
strong probability of error in tests No. 3, 4, 5, 6, 15, 16, 17, 21, 22, 23
and 24, so that the equation was recomputed without the results from
these tests, giving x=.0334y-,M.
CURVES.
Due to the small scale of reproduction in this article, it was necessary
to omit the determining points on the curve sheets. Curves for the two
radiators have been plotted together for comparison, and curves have also
been drawn from the data of Lyon &amp; Collins (1897). These curves have
been drawn to the same scales as those from this thesis so as to admit of
easier comparison, although they sometimes cover a greater range of val-
ues than shown. Other data capable of comparison was not available.
Half a dozen groups of points are located on most of the curves plotted
for the Sanitary School Pin Radiator. The curves for the Perfection Pin
Radiator are not so well determined, and are only approximate.
SHEET no. 1.
The computed curves are plotted with full lines and the curves for
loss from the radiator including loss by radiation from box and flues, are
shown by dashed lines. The Perfection Pin Radiator is more efficient
per sq. ft. of surface especially at high velocities of air. This is to be ex-
pected as the pins are much shorter The greater bending of the Sanitary
Pin Radiator curve is also due to the greater length of the pins.
SHEET NO. 2.
These curves were plotted to note the effect of increasing the ve-
locity of air when the difference between the temperatures of the entering
air and the steam remained constant. The increase in temperature of the
air as the velocity of air rises, grows less more rapidly with the Sanitary
Pin than with the Perfection. With a constant velocity of air, the increase
in temperature of the air through the Sanitary Radiator is much more
marked with an increase in temperature of the steam than is the case with
the Perfection Radiator. The curves would also seem to indicate that the
velocity of air for which, with a given steam temperature, the increase in
temperature of the air would be the same through the two radators, is a
function of the steam temperature.

These curves for the Perfection Radiator plotted from data of Lyon
&amp; Collins are determined by a much greater number of points than is the
case with the Perfection curves on sheet No. 2. The difference in the slope
of the curves is due mainly to a greater loss in radiation from their appar-
atus, and to inaccurate correction for same in the figuring of cu. ft. of
air passing.

These curves were plotted for constant velocities of air to note the
effect of increasing difference in temperature between the entering air and

steam or by decrease in the temperature of the entering air. Increase in
temperature of the air is more rapid with increase in temperature of steam
in the case of the Sanitary School Pin Radiator, as noted was from curve
sheet No. 2. The velocity of air makes a very much greater difference in
the case of the Sanitary Pin than in the case of the Perfection Pin Ra-
diator as noted before.

COMPARATIVE PERFORMANCE OF RADIATORS.
it was found impossible to run the apparatus with natural draught,
drawing the air from out of doors, but a few tests were run drawing the
air from the building, and the results reduced to the same conditions for
comparison. They show that with steam of 2300 and entering air of 55°,
the air leaving the Perfection radiator will be at 1590 and that leaving the
Sanitary radiator at 1480. The volume of air in the one case is 162.8 cu.
ft. per hr. per sq. ft. rated surface, and in the second 180.2 cu. ft. An
interesting point is that the condensation or radiation for the two radia-
tors is approximately equal. What the radiators would show with 0° en-
tering air, it is impossible to determine with the data.
It is hoped that these tests will be exended on natutral draught and
with radiators of other depths and shape of extended surface.


A PHYSICAL THEORY OF DYNAMO-ELECTRIC
MACHINES.
THESIS SUBMITTED FOR THE DEGREE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEER.
BY JOHN C PARKER, B. S. ('Ol), A. M. ('02).
PREFATORY NOTE.
That there is a large demand for a method of presenting the laws
governing the behavior of dynamo-electric machines different from the
usual mathematical treatment I am firmly convinced: a very short peda-
gogic practice and a slightly more extended practical experience have led
to this conclusion; and, indeed, my own undergraduate difficulties show,
in the light of subsequent experience, that there is much to be desired
in the way of pedagogic improvement.
The fault with most of the modern methods is, not that they are
too mathematical, but that the mathematics are used as an abstraction, not
as the symbol of a concrete phenomenon. If the student is so fortu-
nate as to be possessed of a good scientific imagination, he can through-
out a mathematical process, if simple enough, see the thing itself in the
symbol, but the generality of humanity are not so endowed, and feel
that there has been some trickery, perhaps.
The remedy seems to be in keeping always prominent the physical
significance of the analytic part of the work.
It is the purpose here to present a theory of dynamo-electric relations
which, not complete or fitted, as it stands, to the immediate use of the
beginner, is still indicative of much that might profitably be done in con-
nection with the more purely algebraic treatment of the subject. It is
claimed for this treatment that it presents to the mind a direct and accurate
view of the causes and significance of certain phenomena. Thus, in
the case of hysteresis losses, we give a somewhat lengthy derivation of
the energy expense, in order to show how the thing itself takes place.
That such a method of physical interpretation is desirable is obvious
if one considers upon what questionable—always—assumptions the whole
theory of alternating currents is founded, wherein, for example, the
assumption of a constant reactance in alternator armatures is decidedly
untenable in the case of the synchronous motor starting with open cir-
cuited field windings. One must always beware where these assumptions
are valid.


If the work be sketchy in execution, that is due to a desire to illus-
trate rather than elaborate any complete theory; application of the method
to special cases is all that can be hoped for and these applications afe
to be made only as occasion demands.
CAP. I.
Before entering specifically upon the consideration of the practical
forms of the dynaino-electric machines, it is desirable that we should give
our attention to the quantities concerned in their operation, the derivation
and relation of these, and the significance of these relations. With this
end in view, but with the presupposition of the more general properties
of the entities involved, we restate a few of the more fundamental prin-
ciples in electro-magnetism.
When two magnetic poles of the same sign are placed in proximity
to each other in the air, they are repelled with a force f=kmm'/*', where
m and m' are the pole strengths, i the distance between poles, and k a
constant such that we define the unit pole by saying that at unit distance
unit poles are mutually repellant with unit force; i. e., k = I. The force
with which a unit pole is acted upon in a magnetic field defines its inten-
sity or field strength H, and the integral of this over the whole surface
of cross section normal to the magnetic flux of the magnetic field meas-
ures the flux * = r HdA. As unit pole is acted upon by a force 1/r' at
S?
4»t
distance r from another unit pole, H = 1/r1, and * = = 4"", the flux
r*
per unit pole. An exploration of the fields of repellant and attractive poles
leads to the formulation of the following conventional statement, "Mag-
netic lines of force flowing in the same direction repel each other, and lines
of force in opposing directions attract," this statement being corollary to
the equally conventional one the "lines of force act like stretched elastic
cords, tending to become as short as possible."
A conductor carrying an electric current is surrounded by concentric
circular lines of force of intensity inversely as the radii, and with a clock-
wise direction viewed from the direction of the current flow. If such a
conductor be placed in a uniform rectilinear magnetic field, we can add
vectorially the original flux and that due to the conductor, and we will
see that there is a massing of magnetic flux on one side and a weakening
on the other side of the conductor, in consequence of which and of the
previous rule the conductor is impelled toward the left when viewd in the
direction of the current flow and of the field flux. The force is f=kIH


per unit length of conductor normal to the magnetic flux, and we define
unit current as the current which causes the conductor to be impelled in
a direction normal to the plane of the field flux and of the conductor with
unit force per unit field; i. e., k = I, and f = IH.
In traversing a magnetic field in such a way as to vary the distribu-
tion of flux between the two sides, a conductor has a potential difference
generated between different points. Now, since the potential at any point
is the work necessary to bring up to that point from infinity unit quantity,
the potential difference is the work necessary to carry unit quantity from
one to the other of the points between which the difference of potential
exists. Now, if H is field intensity, 1 conductor length normal to flux, I

As ds is opposed to f, it should have a negative sign, and so the energy re-
quired to overcome the potential difference per unit quantity of electricity

dt
tential difference is a counter potential or electro-motive force, as it is called
by virtue of the fact that this potential difference is capable of carrying
unit quantity of electricity around a circuit, making a unit opposition to
the electric transfer. Ohm has defined the "resistance" of a circuit in a
form which we may consider the equivalent expression for "the energy
required to carry unit quantity around it in unit time," hence E=RI,

where R = — s, 1 being the circuit length, a its area, and s a constant of
a
the material.
It is to be noted that the above definition of unit current is based upon
no special assumption, and is one which, applied to indefinitely short con-
ductors, is capable of extension by the use of the integral calculus to any
circuit whatever is perfectly general. Further, in the consideration of
the practical application of electro-magnetism, this definition is of more
direct value than others commonly offered.
The unit of current is sometimes defined as the current which, flow-
ing through a unit length of conductor bent to unit radius, acts with unit
force on unit pole at the center. As the conductor is in a field of unit
intensity, this is seen to be a direct consequence of the general law as
stated above.
Another and very useful definition is that current I, flowing through
a straight conductor of indefinite length, acts on a pole m at a distance
2inl
{ with a force . Let AB be the conductor, m the pole at 8 from AB.

Take an element ab of surface normal to 8 of unit width, measured in

An
magneto-motive force is the work required to carry unit pole through
the magnetic circuit. In this expression 1 is measured along the lines of
flux, A is area normal thereto, and m is a constant. Since the field in-
tensity has no component in the plane of the area A, no energy transfer
takes place in carrying a magnetic pole about in this surface; i. e., it is
an equi-potential surface. If we consider the lines of force as being con-
tinuously distributed throughout the space surrounding a source of mag-
netic flux, so that the operations of the differential calculus may be ap-
plied, we can arrive at certain expressions for the energy stored in the
magnetic field as elastic stress. The phenomenon of magnetization
is explained as a state of elastic stress in the ether permeating all space.
In the case of perfectly elastic bodies in which distortion and stress are
in constant ratio, we have the integrated product, that is, the work acting
through space, proportional to one-half the square of the stress or distor-
tion, the factor of proportionality being the former case the volume dis-
torted times the reciprocal of rigidity; in the latter case the volume
times the rigidity. So in the magnetic field we should expect to find the
analogy of this energetic storage, if the magnetic field density is due to
a state of stress, and as a matter of fact we do have the energy stored
= y2L,i2 where i is current in magnetizing coil, and L is a constant, invol-
ving the dimension of the magnetized space and a factor expressing the
character of the medium. Let us consider a portion of magnetized space
bounded by two infinitely close equipotential surfaces dl apart, and by
lines of force including an area dA, the flux of d* threading this tube
is the same that would be produced by a group of infinitely small mag-
netic poles successively brought into the inner surface from the outer, so
that we may write, if dm is the aggregate of these small poles, and B is
flux density,
d* = dAB = 4T dm.
But as the poles are successively brought into place, the field intensity in-
creases in the same ratio; that is, we have a function similar to that in-
volved in the elastic energy storage. We have then, since the distance
through which the small poles are moved is dl, a work done in over-
coming the repulsive effect of the poles already in place.

if with this equation in mind we note that the magnetization curve for
iron, plotted between magneto-motive force H as abscissae, and induced
lines B as ordinates, is a curve enclosing an area when H passes through
cyclic values,—we see that the integrated energy variations are equal to
this inclosed area divided by 4* per unit volume of the iron.
These energy storages and losses must be supplied from some source,
and we proceed to investigate them from the supply end. If a coil of
N turns magnetizes a circuit of magnetic reluctance R by means of a
4*-NI
current I, a flux * is set up equal to * = , extending in closed

lines through the material of the circuit; viz., the magnetic material as
one part and indefinite space as the remainder. These lines during their
extension by the magneto-motive force from co-incidence with their return
circuit through the iron must sweep across the conductors inducing in
them an electro-motive force

Similarly a magnetizing current I induces in a mass, of reluctance R,
4*N
a flux * =: I which is dependent upon R, and hence on the ratio
R
of H/B; as this ratio is greater on rising than on falling values of B,
the E. M. F. induced in the N turns by the variation of ♦ is greater
when ♦ is increasing than when it is decreasing; this means that energy
stored is greater than energy returned. We have

of B and H divided by 4*\
In the preceding discussions reference has been made to the fact
that the M. M. F. of N turns of a conductor carrying a current I is
4T NI; this is seen to be the case if we remember that about an indefinite
straight conductor we have a field intensity 2l/d; but the magnetic cir-
cuit of radius d has a reluctance per unit area of cross section 2&gt;rd, and
so MMF = ARB = 4*1, and for N conductors we have MMF = 4*NI;
expressed somewhat differently, the force f = 2l/d times the distance
2ird gives the energy 4TI required to take unit pole around a circuit
surrounding the conductor and hence is the MMF. In this process 4T
lines of flux from the pole are cut once, and so the product of current


and integrated electro-motive force 4»"I is the work done; this offers,
then, another method of deriving the M. M. F.
CAP. II.
In fundamental discussions of dynamo-electric machines, simplifying
assumptions are made, which, while not strictly in accordance with the
most general conditions, are very fair approximates to the practical facts,
and in any event, give us certain conventional results, discrepancies with
which in any special case may be discussed as vagaries of the individual
machine under consideration. Thus, for instance, we assume in our pre-
liminary discussion of the direct crurent machine-generator or motor
a uniform rectilinear bipolar field, and uniform distribution of conductors
over the surface of the armature, so that the process of integration and
differentiation with respect to regular distances thereon may be applied.
Civen an armature, then, with a total flux * of uniform intensity and
rectilinear, 2N evenly and continuously distributed conductors lying along
the elements of the cylindrical surface whose radius is r, and an angular
velocity » = 21 n, where n is the number of revolutons in unit time;
we note that on the assumption that successive conductors are connected
at opposite ends by a non-E. M. F. generating conductor which gives,
in effect, two parallel conductors from brush to brush, a revolution of
2T/2N will cause a cutting of the entire flux * once by each of the multi-
ple branches; i. e., the flux is cut 2N times per revolution, or 2Nn times
w
in unit time with the resultant induction of 2Nn&lt;P = 2N* as the
2*
E. M. F. We note, otherwise, that in unit width of field there are N'
2N N
cosec 6 conductors, where N' = = , the number of conductors
2»T 7rr
per unit circumference, and if we call ♦' = "JvteR, the flux per unit width
d*
of the field, we have — = N' cosec W dx sin 6 r "&gt;, where x is trans-

verse distance; i. e., E. M. F. is flux intensity times number of conductors
times projected velocity in direction x.
dE *N /»+r dE * N«

dx 2"T J —r dx jt
We note one very significant fact here; viz., the E. M. F. for unit width
of the field is constante for uniform distribution of magnetic flux. Further,
it is noted that if ♦' is not a constant, the integral ♦' dx is equal to ♦x,
the value of ♦ included between the two limits of integration; and hence
the magnitude of the E. M. F. generated in any portion of the magnetic

field is independent of the flux distribution therein, but is a direct function
of the total flux.
Thus, when the brushes of a generator are set in any position a"
other than at the extremity a of the axis normal to the field, the con-
ductors a a" will generate an E. M. F. opposing and equal to and hence
nullifying that of the other conductors a a' included between the line
through the brush parallel to the field axis and the extremity of r. The
conductors from b to b' are then the effective ones, and we have
b—b' 4&gt;Ng&gt; *aNw
2r xx
where *a is the flux traversing the plane of commutation; i. e., E =
•w
cos &lt;t&gt;, the angle of brush shift in the case of uniform field distribution.

Letting N/x = a, we have E = aw*, which is to be interpreted by
saying that the electro-motive force is an expression for the speed and
the field flux. The significance of this simple fact is very great in under-
standing electro-dynamic phenomena.
If now the circuit between the two brushes be closed by a resistance
R, a current I — E/R will flow, half of it coming from each half of the
armature winding. We have then in each conductor an impulsive force
across the field equal to f = V2 */2r, or for the whole half armature
f = l/3 &amp;/2T N, and this multiplied by the moment of a semi-circular arc

ture the torque T = NI ♦/«■. Or, defining N, ♦' as before in unit width

2r 2»r 2*t
T equals NI*/"- = a\ *; that is, the torque is the product of field strength
by the ampere turns (or magnetic-motive force of the machine) by a con-
stant. It may be said, then, that the dynamo-electric machine consists
of two magnets,—one of definite flux, direction fixed or otherwise, the
other having a component of its flux always in space quadrature with fflie
first; i. e., with a relative angular velocity equal and opposite to that of
the material of which it is made, whatever this velocity may be with
respect to the definite flux direction. As the components of the fluxes
in the same or opposite directions can exert no torque, they are ineffec-
tive in producing torque and motion. We have an expression for torque,
T = /3&lt;M&gt;' cos &lt;t&gt;, where &lt;t&gt; is the angle by which the field flux directions
depart from quadrature. This statement is perfectly general, applying
to all dynamo-electric machines, direct current machines, alternators,
synchronous, induction, hysteresis, and reaction motors, and affords a
very excellent interpretation of power factor phenomena. As a special
application, we may consider the case when the brushes of a direct cur-
rent machine are shifted from the neutral, the bands a'a and aa" neutral-
NI
ize each other, and torque T = * cos &lt;t&gt; = £**' cos &lt;t&gt;, an expression
IT
highly suggestive of the expression P — IE cos &lt;t&gt; for alternating current
circuits.
We have noted that the E. M. F. is an expression for the speed of
E
rotation « = , if now we take the product of this by torque of which
a&lt;p
the current is the indication, we have the power
E
P = «T = ol* - IE,
a*
a result independent of the constants of the machine and of the field flux.
It is to be noted that since torque and E. M. F. expressions are both
line integrals, these deductions apply as well to the case of non-uniform
fields. We have an interpretation for the mathematical relations between
electrical and mechanical quantities in dynamos, that the current is a
measure of the torque, and the E. M. F. of the speed for a given *, and
that flux determines, not the power, but the distribution of the two factors
speed and torque.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Drawing now the curves of E. M. F. and time and of current and time
for a given conductor, we see that we have a sine curve of period 2-ir/u
for the E. M. F., time being reckoned from the instant when the conduc-
tor was at the neutral axis, and a "square-shouldered" curve of frequency
equal to that of the E. M. F. curve and amplitude lA I for the current wave,
passing through zero in the same direction as E. M. F.; i. e., upward, at
a time &lt;t&gt;/a later than E. M. F. curve, &lt;t&gt; being taken to be positive for
forward brush shifts. In the case of the motor, the current is opposite
in phase to what it is in a generator. It is seen from these curves that
the current lags in phase &lt;t&gt; behind the E. M. F., and hence we may say

that P = E I cos &lt;P, where E is understood to mean the E. M. F. on
the neutral axis; that is, the power is the current-E. M. F. product
times the cosine of the angle of lag or lead. Further, a consideration of
the armature as an electro-magnet reveals the fact that it has a M. M. F.
component— —kl sintf&gt;, tending to demagnetize the fields with lagging
current and to magnetize with leading, but since I for a motor is negative,
i. e., against the E. M. F., we have the opposite effect. It is further
seen that a cross-magnetizing effect k I cos0 exists when I is negative,
as in a motor, tends to distort the field against the direction of rotation,
otherwise with it.
If now we consider the E. M. F. induced per conductor, and inte-
grate values from side to side of the band of active conductors, we have
Em» cos i&gt;, and if we similarly take the band of dead turns, we may rep-
resent it by its projection on its chord, as Em.isin &lt;t&gt;\ in other words,
the projected dead turns and the effective turns projected, squared, and
added give the square root of the total diametrically projected turns, or
E -f" E© = E mni,
where Ee are the volt equivalent of the projected lost turns, and E* E =
tan 0. As hte study of the alternating current machines will show, £,
are in quadrature with E, and in that case are the voltage drop due to
inductance. So, here, the shift of the brushes is due to the fact that
there is an inductance in the armature coils in virtue of which it becomes


necessary to supply an E. M. F. to alternately store and unstore electric
energy Vi LI2, an operation which would be wattless were it not for the
resistance of the brushes, which cannot be quite zero, but is very low.
Although this fact is evident from the very nature of the electric phe-
nomena involved, it may be somewhat interesting to note the dynamic
significance of the fact. If we observe the conductors in a generator,
we note that from the point of leaving one brush to the successive ex-
tremity of the neutral axis there exists a counter-torque-producing effect,
while from this extremity of the neutral axis to the next brush edge
exists a positive-torque-producing effect. If the brush were of zero width,
we would say that in the portions of the field not intercepted between the
two points of commutation, torque and counter-torque opposed and neutral-
ized each other, while within these limits torque is all consumptive of
that applied as a mechanical power component to drive the machine,—a
statement which holds for finite brush widths other than zero, if we sub-
stitute for the points of commutation the outer brush edges in the first
case, and the inner—those near the field axis—in the other. This leaves
the band of the field width in which the brush surface lies to be still
accounted for, and we wish to show that for this band we may consider
conductors on either side the point where current is zero as belonging
with the adjacent conductors not under the brush, and the above state-
may then be extended to the whole armature considering that commu-
tation is instantaneous at the point of zero current in the
short-circuited conductor; this will be proven if we can show that the
deficiency of motor torque on the side of the brush where current is
decaying from what would exist if current in these conductors had full
value is equal to the generator counter-torque deficiency on the side of the
growing current, since these two deficiencies neutralize. If the product of
conductor length by field intensity by conductor number per unit are

since the current changes from Vi I to zero in the half brush width between
either edge and the point of current reversal, the torques due to the de-
caying and rising currents are equal. This could have been inferred at
once from the fact that the current is a right line function of distance
across the field, as equal portions of the field are equally effective in pro-
ducing torque for a given current. We thus see that the operation of re-
sistanceless commutation is wattless, and that one-half the field width
under the brush is effective in unstoring energy l/2 Li', while the other
half stores an equal amount. In case the resistance of the commutated
coil is appreciable, or if the brush contact has resistance, the decaying
current will be more rapidly killed by the resistance, since a part of the
E. M. F. of self-inductance will be consumed by the IR volts, leaving only
L dl/dt—RI to be balanced by the generator voltage, wherefore dl/dt
will be correspondingly greater than in the case of resistanceless commu-
tation. So the resistance will oppose the increment of the rising current,
giving as a result an unbalanced generator torque with the consumption of
power, since the counter-torque area is greater than that aiding the ro-
tation. The calculation is a little more complicated than that above, in-
volving a differential equation of the second degree, which solves as a
logarithmic function. The point is that energy is consumed in commuta-
ting, in this case the expenditure of torque; we see from these considera-
tions whence we have the I2R brush losses in the form of mechanical
energy.
In this connection it may be worth while to call attention to the two
methods—or rather factors, since neither exists alone—of commutation.
We have just noted what is known as voltage commutation, in which
voltage induced in the commutated coil overcomes the reactive volts and
reverses the current, bringing it up to the value of that in the adjacent
and leading coil. We have seen that the projected brush area—on the flux
direction—must be proportional to the current commutated, so that with
different currents different brush shifts must be used, which is trouble-
some, almost impossible in many cases. To obviate this, resource is to
be had to the use of a high resistance brush contact by the use of carbon
brushes, which, although entailing the loss of a small per cent of energy,
involves a very decided advantage in the way of convenience of operation.
In this case, when the mica strip of the commutator has just passed the
first edge of a brush, an at first finitesimal width of brush surface shunts
in the current from the next coil, while the Vi LI5 energy of self-induc-
tance of the short-circuited coil fritters itself into E'/R brush losses. At
the further edge of the brush the reverse takes place; a shunt of increas-


ing resistance is offered to the coil under commutation, so that the cur-
rent is gradually forced around through the adjacent lagging coil. If this
operation takes place with a reasonably low frequency, it is obvious that
a wide range of currents may be commutated in any position, and, owing
to the comparatively high brush resistance for a reasonable inductive
voltage, no destructive local currents will exist.
As self-inductance per coil is proportional to the square of the number
of turns per coil, and to the frequency, the E. M. F. of self-induction is
for a given armature field flux, and angular velocity in inverse ratio to
the number of bars of the commutator; that is, the number of turns per
bar squared, times the number of commutations per revolution is in the
ratio of the volts induced by self-inductance. But volts induced for com-
mutation purposes would be in the ratio of the turns per bar, or the inverse
ratio to the number of bars. Therefore, so far as these factors alone are
concerned, commutation should be independent of commutator design for
a given armature, field flux, and speed.
To generate different voltages with one and the same armature, we
may either vary the speed, or change the field flux. In the former case,
both the voltage of self-induction and the volts induced by the conductors
moving across the field flux vary as the speed, and commutation is, for
a given armature current, independent of speed, that is, of the volts in-
duced. In the latter case, less easily attainable in practice owing to the
saturation of the field at high flux and instability at low flux, as we shall
see later, the self-induced volts are constant, while the commutation volts
vary with the field flux. In such a case, so far as commutation is con-
cerned, the armature current might be made proportional to the voltage,
as in a series of machines. This indicates in a general way the reason
for commutation difficulties in the case of weakened field and at all con-
siderable armature current. Armature reaction will be considered later.
The variable speed condition is that commonly met with in the case of
variable speed motors, which are operated at nearly full field and variable
armature volts.
In cases where differences of voltages too great to be obtained by
speed variations are desired, the armature must be rewound; flux con-
ditions being fixed by commercial conditions, such as hysteretic, eddy
current and excitation losses, regulation and commutation. Since the
self-induced volts are in the ratio of the square of the number of turns,
and in smiple ratio to the current and frequency of commutation, while
commutation volts are in the ratio of the number of armature turns per
commutation bar, for a given power output self-induced and commutation
volts alike are in the ratio of the number of turns of armature winding
per bar, rendering the commutation conditions independent of the voltage
for which the core is wound.


We would note here, however, that although the relative difficulty in
commutation seems to be pretty much independent of operating conditions,
the absolute discrepancy due to an error in setting of brushes is propor-
tional to the volts between successive bars, wherefore the quantity should
be kept constant by making the number of the bars proportional to speed,
field strength, and turns, armature winding; in other words, by making
the commutation and self-induced volts the same for all types of machines.
This will result in a necessarily proportionate dimensioning of brush
width. This is also necessitated by the desirability of keeping within rea-
sonable limits the E2R loss in the brushes, while the commutator bars are
short-circuited.
The subject of resistance commutation admits of a similar discussion,
which it is not deemed expedient to give here.
Before leaving the subject of commutation, a word might be said
relative to the phenomenon of "arcing over." When a machine sparks
badly at the brush, a small arc is formed across the mica strip of the
commutator, or from bar to brush over the mica. The chilling of this
arc by radiation, etc., causes its resistance to rise and the current to cease,
unless the arc, as first formed, is large enough to persist until the conduc-
tor short-circuited passes into the more active position, when the greater
E. M. F. causes a greater current flow with greater temperature of arc
and a consequent reduction of resistance. With a certain initial spark
then the local current will become unstable, and will persist with a very
large magnitude, carrying the arc to the next brush or some part in con-
nection therewith, thus short-circuiting the machine by a vapor arc.
Reference has been made to the magneto-motive force of the arma-
ture or armature reaction. It will be interesting to note the influence of
this and the "saturation" characteristic of the fields on the machine oper-
ation. In general, the effect is to weaken the field and to distort it—in
the direction of armature rotation of a generator—-in the opposite direction
in a motor. If the air gap of the machine is too large, and the poles not
too near together, the magneto-motive force of the armature is not at all
considerable in comparison with that required to overcome the air gap
reluctance, and so the demagnetizing effect of the armature is relatively
small. If the fields are worked strongly saturated, the same statement
holds good, with the further fact that a large change in the resultant mag-
neto-motive force does not very greatly alter the magnetic induction. In
these cases the machines are very stable, and, if generators, give very
straight characterises, in the latter case at constant voltage, in the former
at voltage nearly proportional to the excitation. In this case—that of the
straight booster or generator—stability is attained by large air gaps,
straightness of characteristic by working the iron on the straight part of
the curve, and proportionately to the excitation by taking the lower of


the two straight parts; in other words, by working the iron under-satu-
rated.
Owing to the M. M. F of the field windings and of the armature,
there will be set up in the air immediately surrounding the iron magnetic
circuit, a certain leakage flux, proportional to these M. M. F's., divided
by the reluctance of the leakage flux circuits. We have already seen that in
series with the field winding there is a M. M. F. of the armature which
diminishes or increases the effective field flux, and which also shifts the
flux about the axis of rotation of the armature, this shift being without
influence on the value of the flux, provided the iron of the frame is not
near saturation. We have, in addition to this, certain magnetic flux
through circuits in multiple with the main magnetic circuit, so that the
flux is not the same at different sections of the circuit. At present, we
are not particularly interested in the field leakage, but call attention to
it, as it will assume a very decided importance when we come to deal with
the alternating current transformer and induction motor. Confining our
attention, then to the stray flux threading through the armature, we ob-
serve that the armature conductors set up a M. M. F. which has its max-
imum value on the axis of commutation, and is equal to the product of
the current by the number of turns of the armature about the point at
which the M. M. F. is being taken; such a M. M. F. divided by the re-
luctance of the magnetic circuit forming the path for the flux due thereto
gives the value of this flux. If the reluctance is unaffected by angular
variations in the flux direction, the flux will obviously have its maximum
value at the axis of commutation, and will be zero at 90 degrees there-
from. It will be noticed that the polarity of the armature (as a magnet)
is the same as that of the field pole toward which it is rotating in a gen-
erator, and is opposite thereto in a motor. As the armature revolves,
each conductor will cut through this flux, the rate of cutting being great-
est when the conductor is undergoing the process of commutation, that is,
at the very axis of commutation, and being zero when the current in the
conductor is at the "middle" of its half rectangle of wave shape; that
is, the volts induced by the stray field are in quadrature with the current.
It will be noted from the relative polarity of the field and the armature
that the volts induced in the armature by this "field" are, at commutation,
a maximum in the direction in which the current has been flowing; in
other words, they lag a quarter phase behind the current. A little con-
sideration will show that the frequency of commutation is the rate ait
which the leakage flux is cut, and that we have a number of conductors
cutting across a flux which is proportional to their own ampere turns;
in other words, that the equation
applies to this case, where L is the co-efficient of self-inductance of the


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
armature, « the frequency of commutation, and I the current under com-
mutation. If the ordinates of the wave of this induced E. M. F. be
added to those of the other E. M. F. wave, it is s!een that tihe total
wave is smaller and more nearly in phase with the lagging current. We
shall have to refer to this again when we have under discussion the poly-
phrase alternator. This reluctance voltage from brush to brush is, of
course, zero, and further is not strictly sunusoidal.


As we saw in the case of the generator that a current in the direction
N
of the armature E. M. F. produces a torque I* = T in a direction
rr
opposed to the angular velocity, so also a current —I in opposition tc
N
the E. M. F., will produce a torque -\- I* = T in the direction of
IT
rotation. This current can only be made to flow by and in direct ratio
to the excess of the E. M. F. applied to the machine over that generated
by it, the proportionality factor being the armature resistance. We now
have mechanical energy given out by the machine; that is, it acts as a
motor.
From this point of view certain features in the action of motors
become evident. If in any way the excess of applied E. M. F. over that
generated by the machine be increased above the value necessary to
impel a sufficient current to give a torque equal to that of the load—as
by a rise of applied E. M. F., a weakening of the field, or a decrease in
the load,—the machine will take an increased current, and the extra torque
thus developed will expend itself in acceleration of the moving parts,
until the increased load at higher speed—if it does increase—together


with the diminution of the E. M. F. difference, brings about a new state
of equilibrium. In the case of a shunt motor, it is to be noted that such
change of speed is very small within the limits of ordinary operation for
unvarynig field excitation, since, the resistance potential difference being
very small in comparison to that of the line, a small change of speed is
competent to give a large change in armature current, and hence take
care of a large load change. Such a machine is said to give close speed
regulation. If the increase of load leads to a dimination of field current
through armature reaction, we may even have negative regulation, in
some cases so severe that the machine will "run away" under load.
These consideratoins show why a change of field excitation too sudden
for the machine to follow, due to its moment of inertia, may result in
vicious sparking or arcing over of the large "rush current." Similar
effects are found when a motor operates on a circuit where the voltage
varies too rapidly for the inductive field and inertia-constrained parts to
follow it.
Since armature current is fixed at a maximum by the heat-radiating
capacity of the armature, the maximum output of a motor, whose speed
is varied by the field excitation, is constant, since the spe£d is given by
E—IR
E — IR = E' = a&lt;»* whence « = and torque is ol*, whence
P = "T = IE—PR. Here, then, as in the generator, the power is only
indirectly a function of ♦, this quantity being the parameter which affects
the distribution of the two factors w and T of the power P.
In addition to the useful torque of the machine, there exist two
sources of prejudicial torque,—the hysteresis in the iron, and the eddy
currents. This latter may be most conveniently treated in a later place
under the head of alternating currents, and so for the present we leave it,
noting that the eddy current losses in a motor consume energy by exert-
a torque against the direction of rotation, the energy being that derived
from the electrical energy converted into mechanical energy by the motor,
and then back into the electrical energy of the alternating current In
the case of the generator, part of the* mechanical energy of the prime or
driving motor is directly converted into alternating current energy, as
if the machine consisted of a direct current generator and a small alter-
nator on one shaft, the sum of their energies representing the mechanical
energy supply while in the case of the motOT the difference between the
direct current motive energy and the alternator output is the mechanical
output.
We have seen that the hysteresis loss per cycle is equal to the volume
of iron multiplied by % r times the area of the hysteretic curve; this
divided by the angle turned through per cycle 2 t gives the torque

But the energy represented by the hysteresis in this case was shown to
have the above value by a consideration of the product of current and
self-induced volts as the iron was taken through a complete cycle, whereas,
in the present case—that of a disc rotated in a field normal to its axis—
such a proof is not possible. Although, from the principle of the con-
versation of energy, we can say that our torque equation as given above
is correct, still, it is considered desirable, as rendering clearer the phy-
sical conception of the process, to derive this directly.
As the armature iron rotates in the field flux, the direction in which
the flux threads each element area of the cylindrical surface changes
through the complete cycle in one revolution, with the result that, if there
be no hysteresis, each element area may be looked upon as a small mag-
net of intensity equal to the flux density of the field times the small
elemental area divided by 4T and multiplied by the cosine of the angle
of displacement of the element from the axis or flux through the axis
dAH
of rotation; i. e., m = cos*. This would be attracted to the
4*
neighboring pole piece with a force mH/2, and would thus give a turn-
ing moment of mH/2r sin#, substituting in this the value of m and inter-
grating, we have the intergral of sin 20 as the 8 factor, or zero torque,
as would be expected, since at angle 9 on either side of the axis is an aTea
element, each exerting the same force as the other at an equal and oppo-
site lever arm, their moments thus equalizing each other. In tlie case
where hysteresis exists, however, the flux density does not follow the mag-
netizing force quite rigorously, with the result that there is a resultant
torque opposed to rotation.
[The proof that the attraction of the elementary area by one of the poles
= Hm/2 is as follows:—Let a pole m be at a distance d from a pole
piece of indefinite width, the flux density from which is H. At an angle
8 from the perpendicular from the pole-piece upon the pole face the angle
d0 subtends a length on the pole face dr = r'dfl sec 0 — d see7" 69, where
r' is the distance from the pole to the element dr, and r is the projection
of r' on the pole. The area of the pole face 2"" rdr = 2fd" tan 9 sec3 OdO
is the seat of a flux H 2fd2 tan 9 sec2 969, and may be said to exert
a pull on the pole m equal to that o fa pole of intensity H/2d2 tan9 sec' 8A9,
distributed around the circumference of radius r, the radial components
of which force equalize each other, leaving a resultant normal force, by
the law of magnetic tractive effort:—

If we let B represent the flux intensity through any area element r&lt;19
of a cylindrical element of the armature of unit length, and H. the mag-
netic-motive force normal to the same, from which we have H. = H cos0,
we may write as the expression for elemental torque:—

It is thus shown that the effect of hysteresis in the armature iron is
to give an unequal distribution of induction on the two sides of the field


axis, massing it on the side of the trailing pole with the result that the
armature core may be considered as a magnet with its axis of flux dis-
placed from that of the field by an angle a so that the quantity sin a is a
measure of the torque, and hence of the energy expended. Here then
is a physical interpretation of Steinmetz' angle of hysteresis lead; the
iron must have rotated through an angle a; that is, the otherwise wattless
excitation wave must have advanced a in phase to accomplish the reversal
of magnetization in the core.

VELOCITY OF FLOW OF HOT WATER IN PIPES AND
RADIATORS.
THESIS OF J. T. PRATT, '04, AND J. R. MANSFIELD, '04
If the laws governing the flow of hot water in pipes, radiators, etc.,
could be determined, they would be of great benefit to engineers, especially
those interested in hot water systems of heating. For the purpose of
obtaining some information along this line a series of tests have been
made with an apparatus erected in the Mechanical Laboratory of the
University of Michigan. The apparatus used in the following tests is
illustrated by the accompanying line diagram.
Following is a descriptoin of the system as used for calibration tests.
(D) is a cast iron shell containing a i'A inch pipe coil (E). Leaving
the shell at top and bottom are VA inch pipes (F) and (R) which are
carried upward and united by a short pipe passing through a galvanized
sheet iron cooling tank (J). Cooling water enters this tank and is dis-
tributed by three pipes discharging at the bottom of same, being wasted
at the top through overflow (K). Steam first passes through separator
(V) where most of the moisture is removed. It is then throttled and
superheated at reducing valve (U) after which it passes through sepa-
rator (Z) which acts as a receiver and an additional safeguard against
wet steam. Entering heater coil (E) it heats the surrounding water
and is itself condensed. This condensed steam flows through pipe (B)
to cooling coil (A) and thence to tub on scales where it is weighed. The
system is filled through pipe (P). Pipe (M) extends upward to expan-
sion tank (L) situated about 6 feet above cooling tank (J) an overflow
pipe (N) being attached to this tank to keep the total head of water
constant. The circulating water after being heated by coil (E) passes
up through hot leg (F), is cooled in tank (J) and then passing down
cold leg (R) again enters heater. (G) is a small valve used to remove
air on filling the system with water. The steam piping, separators, heat-
er, condensed steam piping, and hot leg, were all heavily lagged with
hair felt. In all tests readings were taken at five minute intervals and all
instruments used were very carefully standardized.
The calibration tests were run as follows. The system was filled
with water to the overflow in the expansion tank (the valve (G) being
open until the air was removed) the valve (O) then being closed. Tem-
perature and pressure of entering steam were registered by thermometer
(Ti) and gauge (X). Passing through heater the steam was condensed,


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
its temperature on leaving being given by thermometer (Ts). This water
was then drawn off to tub on scales, its level in gauge glass (C) being kept
constant. The temperature of the circulating water leaving the heater
was given by (Tj), while (T5) registered its temperature just before
entering the cooling tank. On leaving tank (T«) gave the temperature
which was again registered by (Ti) before entering the heater.
The actual velocity was obtained as follows. From gauge (X) and
thermometer (Ta) the total heat in the entering steam was obtained.
Subtracting from this the heat in the condensed steam as determined by

(Ti), the heat given to the system per pound of steam was found, which
multiplied by the pounds of condensed steam per hour, equaled the heat
(H) given to the system per hour. (H) divided by the difference in
temperature between (Tt) and (Ti) gave the pounds of circulating water
per hour (W), assuming no radiation from heater. Obtaining the aver-
age weight of water in the system per cubic foot from temperatures (Ti),
(T(), (Tu), and (T«) and dividing the weight of water circulating per
second by this, we found the cubic feet of water flowing in system per
second. This divided by the internal area of the 1^4 inch pipe in square


73
feet gave the actual velocity of the water in feet per second at the point
whose cross section was used.
Theoretical Velocity—The average weight of water in the hot leg
being obtained from (T4) and (T0) the head in feet which would pro-
duce one pound pressure per square inch in the hot leg was found by di-
viding 144 by this weight. Dividing the total head in feet by the feet-
head for one pound pressure per square inch, the pressure in pounds
per square inch is obtained. Repeating the same operation for the cold
leg, the difference in pressure in the two legs was that producing
How. Multiplying this by the feet head for one pound pressure per
square inch in the cold leg, the head producing flow was obtained.

in feet, the theoretical velocity was found.
Curve (No. 1) shows the relation between the theoretical and
actual velocity, while (No. 2) gives the relation between the theoretical
velocity and the efficiency (actual velocity divided by theoretical velocity).
The maximum efficiency is here obtained with a theoretical velocity of
3.05, the efficiency being almost constant between 2.95 and 3.15.

RADIATOR TESTS.
The second set of tests was made upon a 38 inch, three column, seven
section Niagara radiator, the only change in the apparatus being the in-
insertion of the radiator in place of the cooling tank. The theoretical
and actual velocity were obtained as before described.

The accompanying table 2 is a summary of a series of six similar tests.
RADIATION TESTS.
The final set of tests were run to determine if possible the radiation
from the heater. For these tests the cooling tank (J) was again placed
in position but the cooling water entered it through a single pipe discharg-
ing at the bottom at the end nearest (T») while overflow was taken from
the top of the tank at the opposite end, the cooling water thus being forced
to travel the entire length of the tank. To obtain increased cooling sur-
face a large number of galvanized sheet iron wings were tightly bolted
to the circulating pipe in the tank, thus forming an extended surface
which allowed a decrease in the amount of cooling water with a corres-
ponding increase in (Tu). The cooling water was metered and its tem-
perature at entrance to and exit from tank, taken.
The actual velocity was determined as before described, assuming no
radiation from the heater. The corrected actual velocity allowing for
radiation in the heater was found as follows. The cubic feet of cooling
water per hour being obtained from the meter and its temperature from
(Tu) its weight was known. This multiplied by the difference in tem-
perature between (Tu) and (Tu) equalled the total B. T. U's. given to
the cooling water per hour which divided by the difference in tempera-
ture between (Tu) and (T«) gave the actual water circulating in the sys-
tem per hour in pounds. Dividing the pounds circulating per second by
the average weight of water in the system the cubic feet of water circu-
lating per second were obtained which divided by the area of the \lA
inch pipe in square feet gave the corrected actual velocity in the pipe.
The radiation from the heater was obtained as follows. (H) must
be equal to the B. T. U's. lost throughout the entire system. The heat
given to the cooling water was found as above. The radiation in the
hot and cold legs was obtained by multiplying the actual pounds of cir-


70
culating water per hour by the difference in temperature in each leg.
(H) minus the sum of the radiations from the hot and cold legs and the
heat given to cooling water was equal to the heat radiated from the heater
per hour. The same radiation should be obtained by multiplying the
difference in the weight of the circulating water per hour as obtained
with and without radiation by the difference in temperature (T«) and
(Ti). This divided by the difference in temperature between the heater
and the room gave the B. T. U's. radiated per hour per degree difference
in temperature.
The accompanying table 3 is a summary of a series of seven tests
upon the radiation of the system.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
TEMPERATURE DETERMINATION OF A GAS ENGINE.
THESIS OF M. A. HALL, '04, AND C A. FULLER, '04.
INTRODUCTION.
Owing to the great increase in the use of the gas engine and to its
important place in modern power plants, the theory of the gas engine
cycle and its thermodynamics has been made the subject of a great deal
of excellent research work. One very important part of this work has
been much neglected, namely the temperatures. This portion of the
work has been so little investigated and there is so little known about it,
that one would be safe in the statement that nothing is known of the
temperatures produced in a gas engine cycle.
Clerk in his excellent work on the Gas Engine gives for the theo-
retical temperature of combustion of hydrogen in a closed vessel and
at a constant volume as i6oso°F. in oxygen and 7446°F. in air. Owing
to chemical dissociation which commences at 1760° no such temperatures
have been recorded. Bunsen in his experiments on hydrogen burning
in oxygen found 68720 while Mallard and LeChatelier reached practically
the same temperature 63320. For hydrogen burning in air Bunsen ob-
tained 3632°, Mallard and LeChatelier 33260 and Clerk 3452° while the
calculated maximum for hydrogen in air is 7446°.
Of course these results differ from the actual temperatures of the
gas engine practice for pure hydrogen is never used as a fuel and gasoline
vapors or gas could not be expected to furnish as high temperatures.
So that, accurate as the foregoing results may be they are of no value
whatever in gas engine practice.
In graduate work on this subject at Columbia, R. H. Fernald obtained,
with the gas entering at a constant volume, temperatures of I440°F.
average for exhaust with a maximum temperature of 2025°F.
OBJECT.
The object of this test was to obtain the temperatures of explosion
by observation and calculation, and the same for the exhaust temperature.
A Green pyrometer being situated in the exhaust pipe and our tempera-
tures being read at the same time as this pyrometer, we obtained the cali-
bration of it. Also in the course of our preliminary tests we obtained the
influence of hot and cold jackets upon the mechanical efficiency of the
engine. In the course of our work it was necessary also to calibrate the
air and gas meters used. So the object of this test became five-fold.
First, the determination of explosion temperatures. Second, the deter-


n


mination of exhaust temperatures. Third, the calibration of the Green
pyrometer. Fourth, the influence of hot and cold jackets upon the effici-
ency. Fifth, the calibration of the air and gas meters.
ENGINE, APPARATUS AND TESTS.
ENGINE.
The engine used in this test was rated at 12 horse power, made by
the Fairbanks, Morse Co., at Beloit, Wis. It works upon the Beau de
Rochas, commonly called the Otto, cycle. The cylinder is 8-17/64" in di-
ameter by 13-63/64" stroke, both the cylinder and cylinder head being
water jacketed. The inlet valve is of the mushroom or poppet type and
is self-operated. It is opened to admit the charge by suction and is held
on its seat by a coiled spring. The exhaust valve is of the same type and
is operated by the exhaust rod. This valve also reseats itself by means of
a coiled spring. The exhaust rod is moved by means of a cam coming
in contact, every fourth stroke, with a roller on the end of the rod. This
cam is operated from the cam shaft which is driven from the main shaft
by one to two gears. The piston is of the trunk type fastened directly to
the connecting rod. Leakage is prevented by castiron piston rings with
staggered joints.
DYNAMOMETER.
The dynamometer used was a Prony brake with a 63" arm. The brake
load was regulated by a hand wheel and was measured on a pair of Buf-
falo scales reading up to 500 pounds.
INDICATOR.
Indicator cards were taken with a Crosby Gas Engine indicator using
a 240-pound spring. In the preliminary tests five minute intervals were
used and a card taken every interval while in the final runs the intervals
were of ten minutes each and two cards were taken every interval.
REVOLUTIONS AND EXPLOSIONS.
The revolutions per minute were taken by an ordinary speed counter
using a stop watch. The explosions per minute were counted by a continu-
ous explosion counter reading up to six places, made by Shaffner &amp; Burden-
berg of New York. The motion was taken from the exhaust rod and
transmitted to the counter by a string and lever. The explosions recorded
were divided by the time interval to obtain the explosions per minute.
JACKET WATER.
The temperature of the jacket water .was taken by two thermometers,
one in the inlet pipe and one in the outlet pipe which was on the top of
the cylinder. The water was run through a meter, but this not being a
very accurate means of measuring, was discarded and the water was
weighed directly.
TEMPERATURES.
The temperature of the exhaust was read on a Green Pyrometer,


reading from o" to I500°F., placed in the exhaust pipe near the engine.
The temperature of the exhaust at atmospheric pressure was taken by
means of an ordinary thermometer in a special rig designed for this pur-
pose. On the exhaust pipe was attached a tee from the lower side of
which led a pipe to a reducing pressure valve, this latter being let down
into a large chamber from which small holes led to the atmosphere. Be-
tween the engine and the reducing pressure valve was placed a cock.
The chamber mentioned above was first built of brick two layers deep,
the inner layer laid on edge and the outer layer laid flat, both without mor-
tar so that the gases could pass out between the bricks. This brick cham-
ber was covered with a wooden cover consisting the two layers of one
inch (i") plank laid crosswise one on the other with holes for the tee
and thermometers. This brick chamber was not very satisfactory so an
eighteen inch (18") sewer tile was bought, holes chipped in the lower end
of it, about Ya," in diameter. There were eight of these holes in all. Tehn
the tile was set up on end with a 3" rubber band bound around the lower
end and to cover the holes. The wooden cover was fitted to this, the un-
der side of which was covered with mineral wool and the whole packed
so as to be air tight. This worked very well in practice, the gases escap-
ing through the holes in the tile and the rubber band preventing an in-
rush of cold air from the outside. In this way we obtained the tempera-
ture of the exhaust gases at atmospheric pressure. By opening the cock
and allowing the gases to rush into the chamber for about eight minutes,
then closing the cock and allowing the gases to come to atmospheric pres-
sure the temperature was read.
PRESSURE REDUCER.
The pressure reducing valve mentioned above consisted of a 2" tee
with a plug in the top through which passed a %" steel rod and a nipple
and cap at the bottom, the bottom of the cap being freely perforated with
holes. At the lower end of the steel rod was attached a flat disk. This
disk was held up against the bottom of the cap by a helical acting at the
upper end of the rod. The gases thus rush out through the openings in
the cap forcing down the disk and compressing the spring at the top. By
screwing down the nut at the top of the rod thus tightening the spring
any desired resistance to the gases could be obtained and at the same
time any tendency to wire draw or throttle the gas prevented. The pipe
leading to the chamber was jacketed but the tile having walls 1" thick
was not jacketed, previous experience having shown that it was really
unnecessary. In this determination two thermometers were used, one
being kept in the chamber at all times and the other being inserted only
after the gases had been shut off. In general the thermometer left in the
chamber continually registered about 75° higher than the other.


8i
METERS.
The air was metered by means of a large station gas meter, the air
being blown in by means of a centrifugal fan operated by a small motor,
rated at 2*A horse power. This air was blown in through a long curved
tin pipe in which was an opening with a slotted slide so that the opening
could be closed as much as was desired, thus regulating the air supply.
Later this meter was calibrated. The meter read to 10 cubic feet and by
interpolation could be read to single feet. The gas was also metered by
an accurate meter reading to 1/100 of a cubic foot and calibrated by com-

Indicator Card No. 4, Run No. 4.
parison with a standard meter reading to 1/1000 of a cubic foot. After
passing the meter the gas passed through a gas bag, which regulated the
supply pressure. The temperature of the gas was obtained from a thermo-
meter attached to gas meter while the room temperature near the blower
was also carefully noted. The quantity of gas was later figured on a basis
of 6o° F. and atmospheric pressure, this being the standard condition.
CLEARANCE.
The clearance volume was measured by the usual water method. In
this determination, made on Feb. 16, 1904, the weight of water before


filling was 23.8 pounds at 45° F. and after filling the clearance space was
13.8 pounds so that the difference 10 pounds, represented the clearance
volume. At 45° water weighs 62.42 pounds per cubic foot so that 10 di-
vided by 62.42 gives .1602 cubic feet as the clearance volume, or 276.84
cubic inches. The total volume of the cylinder including clearance is .594
cu. feet or 1027.08 cu. inches, so that the percentage of clearance is 27%.
This gives the compression pressure 80 pounds by computation.
TEMPERATURE DETERMINATION.
After the preliminary runs were made to determine the mechanical
efficiency and to ascertain approximately the ratio of air to gas best suited
to the different loads, the thermo-electric pyrometer was rigged up and
placed in the opening on top of the cylinder left when the hot tube igniter
had been removed. The plug which contained this thermo couple was
made of brass, the inside being bored out to present a shoulder. Into this,
which was about 1" high, was screwed a short piece of V2" iron pipe about
2" in length. Within the whole was placed the wires of the thermo cou-
ple inside of a porcelain tube. This tube was then cemented into the
brass plug and iron pipe using neat portland cement. The wires were
led out at the top of the brass plug through the two holes, care being ta-
ken to insulate them from the metal. A sufficient length of porcelain
tube was used to bring the junction of the couple down to the center of
the cylinder so that the best results would be obtained. The lead wires
were run up to the ceiling and thence to a small room nearby where the
galvanometer was kept. This was a dead-beat instrument and gave ex-
cellent results on a full load but not quite so good on the half load. In
the two final runs samples of the gas were taken and analyzed, so also with
the exhaust gases.
PRELIMINARY RUNS.
Before anything else was done the engine was taken apart, thoroughly
cleaned and oiled, the head was taken off, a new gasket cut for it, new
gaskets put in all pipe unions, the engine put together, oiled and adjusted.
On the first test which is not shown in the inclosed data, with 20
pounds on the scales and a mixture of 6lA to 1, the engine stalled. It
was found on investigating the cause of this that the spring of the inlet
valve was too weak to close the valve properly and that the batteries
were run down. A new spring was made and the batteries changed when
the next run was made on 45, 60 and 75 pounds with a 6 to 1 mixture and
a hot jacket. The next run completed this set being with 60 and 70
pounds on the scales. Two runs were then made with 20 and 45 pounds
on the scales to determine the effect of hot and cold jackets upon
the mechanical efficiency. In all of these tests the water meter showed
conclusively that it was not delicate enough or suited in any way to this
purpose so the discharge pipe was arranged to allow for weighing the


water. This weighing was done on a pair of Buffalo scales of 5° pounds
capacity reading to 1/50 of a pound. The friction was then determined
by removing the brake and allowing the engine to run empty. Later runs
were made with 30 and 80 pounds on the scales so runs were made with
0, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 70, 72, 75 and 80 pounds on the scales. The largest
mechanical efficiency was found to be 93.7% on 80 pounds which was
taken as full load. In the final runs in which the temperature determin-
ations were made, 80 and 50 pounds were used as full and half loads
respectively.
EXHAUST TEMPERATURE.
Below we give an extract from our computations showing the method
of computing temperatures and giving the formulae used in this compu-
tation.
Item 27, Recorded by Pyrometer.
These values were the readings obtained from the pyrometer inserted
in the exhaust main.

MAXIMUM TEMPERATURES
Item 35, Recorded.
The recorded maximum temperatures are the actual temperatures
obtained from the thermo-electric pyrometer inserted in the cylinder.
Item 36, Computed.
The maximum temperature of explosion is computed in the same
manner as the exhaust temperature. The explosion takes place at approx-
Ph
imately constant volume so we may use the formula Tn=Tc — in which Tc
Pc
is the absolute temperature of compression (item 34), Pc, compression


pressure, (item 22), and P» is the pressure of explosion (item 23).
Item 34, Compression Temperature.
Substituting the values of (R) found in item 33, in the equation
V
P V = R Tc or Tc = P —, in which (V) is the clearance volume and
R
(P) is the compression pressure (item 22) and solving gives the absolute
temperature of compression (Tc). Item 34 = Tc — 4600.

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS.
As has been stated, the first five runs were made for the determina-
tion of the mechanical efficiency of the engine at different loads, to de-
termine at what mixture of air and gas the engine seemed to give the
best results, and also to become thoroughly familiar with the operation
and adjustment of different parts. Runs Nos. 2 and 4 were made for the
purpose of determining the influence of hot and cold water jackets on
the running of the engine. In both of these tests the first five readings
were taken with the water as near the boiling point as it was possible to


maintain it and still not allow the piston to seize. A temperature of about
200° F. can be maintained very safely. The next five readings were ta-
ken with the jacket water at about ioo°F. In the report of these runs
an average of the results obtained under each condition is given. The
effect is more marked in the fourth run in which the engine was carrying
very nearly its full load. When the amount of jacket water was increased,
cooling down the cylinder, the engine was barely able to carry the load,
the revolutions dropping from 221 to 179. In the second run the engine
was carrying a light load. When the cylinder was cooled down the rev-
olutions did not drop off, but the number of explosions per time interval
increased thus increasing the I. H . P. and decreasing the mechanical ef-
ficiency. In both cases the exhaust temperature was higher with the lower
jacket water temperature. This is probably due to the increase in the
number of explosions.
A comparison of items 27 and 28 of runs (A) and (B) show the
error that is ordinarily introduced in getting the temperature of the ex-
haust by inserting a pyrometer in the exhaust main. Through the four
strokes of the engine, which are made in completing the cycle, there is
a rapid variation of pressure in the exhaust main and a corresponding
variation of temperature. The pyrometer will only adjust itself to a mean
of these temperatures. This will necessarily be much lower than the tem-
perature of the gas in the cylinder at the opening of the exhaust valve,
which is the true exhaust temperature. It will be noticed, in comparison
of the two runs, that this difference between the recorded and the com-
puted temperatures is larger on the light load than when the engine was
running on full load. This is due to the fact that there was a less num-
ber of explosions per time interval on the light load than on the heavy
load and naturally the mean temperature would be much lower on this
load, while the computed temperature would not necessarily be changed.
This would be altered only by a change in the explosion itself, this de-
pending on the lead of the spark, the mixture of the air and gas or the
quality of the gas itself.
This same reasoning applies also to items 35 and 36, the maximum
temperatures, recorded and computed. These two items compare very
favorably on run (A), even closer than was expected, but there is a
marked difference in run (B). Here again we have recorded an average
temperature corresponding to an average pressure. Not the mean effective
pressure computed from the indicator card however as this is simply the
average pressure throughout one complete cycle and does not take into
account the pressure lost due to the missed explosions per time interval.
If the mean effective pressure were reduced, by means of the indicated
horse power, and expressed in terms of revolutions per minute instead of
explosions per minute it would then be proportional to the recorded mean


temperature. An attempt was made to obtain just the maximum tem-
peratures of explosion by connecting the wires so that the circuit was
closed through the galvanometer just during the time of explosion. But
the instrument was very slow moving and this was not at all satisfactory.
However this might be done with proper instruments.
Probably the largest source of error in this test was in the air and
gas meters. It was assumed that these were reading correct, and was
found afterwards that there was a large error in both of these instru-
ments, especially in the air meter. These were then calibrated and the
correction factor determined. The meters were calibrated by disconnect-
ing the gas meter from the gas main and connecting the pipe, leading to
the engine, at this point. A standard meter was then connected to the
outlet of the meter to be calibrated. Air was then forced by the fan
through the air meter, passing out through the throttle valve of the engine
and through the gas meter and the standard meter. Unfortunately this
method of calibration requires that the meters be run at a much slower
velocity than the speed at which they were run during the test. To be
calibrated accurately they should be run at the same speed at which they
were run during the test.
GAS ANALYSIS.
An analysis of the gas was made as it entered the cylinder and also
an analysis of the exhaust gas. The composition of the entering gas was
as follows:
CO, 9%
GH 5.7%
O 2%
CO 6.5%
H 44A%
CH, 371%
N 5.2%
100.0
The analysis of the exhaust gases gave 10.1% of COi, 1.2% O, and ho
CO. From this data the amount of air used could be computed without
the use of the air meter and also the temperature of the explosion. The
small excess of oxygen in the exhaust gas shows that the mixture of air
»nd gas was about as near correct as it was possible to get it..


EDITORIALS.
It has been left to this year's board the distinction of launching The
Michigan Technic upon a new course, that of a semi-annual publication.
This change, however, we consider simply as a step toward the better, for
it is the hope of the Board that The Michigan Technic may become in the
near future a quarterly publication, and eventually perhaps a monthly.
This move was discussed in early Technics but was never undertaken,
and at this time the immediate cause of adopting the change was a sug-
gestion by our dean in his opening address to the Engineering Society this
year. The step is amply justified in the present size and prosperity of our
department and the important place this school occupies among technical
institutions.
A short review of the varying fortunes of The Technic may not be
out of place here. This paper is the oldest publication in the University
of Michigan. It had its beginning in 1882 under the name of Selected
Papers whch were published annually by the Engineering Society until
1888. In this year it was published for the first time as The Technic,
when it assumed a substantial and artistic form and met with immediate
success. It appeared each year thereafter in much the same form, some
of the distinctive features being retained even at the present time. The
issue of 1901 did not appear for lack of funds, and during the two years
following, the life of The Technic hung in the balance. In 1903 The Tech-
nic was rescued from an untimely death by the untiring efforts of its man-
ager for that year, who made of it an exceptionally fine number, evidenced
by the fact that two editions of it were exhausted. It is now entirely out
of print. It was at this time that the name became The Michigan Technic,
a change that was heartily endorsed by all. The efforts of the editors for
the year following were even more successful, and it is our sincere hope
that with this new lease of life The Michigan Technic may live long and
prosper.
It is a fact worthy of notice that a Technic has never before been is-
sued so early in the year. It should have appeared earlier, however, and
would have but for the delay of the unusually late start, and the uncer-
tainties attendant upon the change in the form of publication. We hope
to offer the second number to our readers by the first of June. It was
not deemed advisable to attempt at the start, individual numbers of the
size of the preceding annual, nevertheless two issues of the present size
affords considerable more space with the opportunity of presenting to our
readers much material that would otherwise be lost.


It is the object of the Board to make of The Michigan Technic a pub-
lication thoroughly representative of University of Michigan engineers.
We have come into touch with our older alumni and also have communica-
tions from many of later years including the more recent graduates. In
the course of the two issues every branch of engineering offered here will
have been represented. We have further endeavored to bring our publi-
cation more closely to the work of the department itself than has been
done in recent years, thus approaching slightly the purpose and character
originally assumed by the Technic as "a record of the work of the Engin-
eering Department." On the whole we feel that we may offer The Mich-
igan Technic to our readers with reasonable assurance that it wll be well
received.
The Board takes this opportunity to thank Prof. Williams and Prof.
Sadler, Prof. Davis and Prof. Allen for kind advice and Mr. Fraser, chair-
man of last year's Board ,for valuable assistance. Other members of the
faculty and alumni have helped us in many ways for which we are sin-
cerely grateful. No small appreciation is due our advertisers, whose pat-
ronage has for the most part borne the expense of publication, and we
hope our readers will bear them in mind. Their names will be recognized
at once as those of the leading firms in their respective lines.
Notice is given elsewhere in this volume of the sad death of Prof.
William Henry Pettee, which occurred May 26, 1904. He was highly es-
teemed by both students and colleagues and his death was keenly felt
throughout the Department.
We do not publish an account of his life at this time for the reason
that a detailed biography by the late Dean, Prof. C. E. Greene, may be
found in The Technic for 1890, and a memorial and sketch by the Uni-
versity Senate appears in the Michigan Alumnus for July, 1904. We re-
count, however, below some of the honors that have fallen to Professor
Pettee. Professor W. H. Pettee was an honorary member of the En-
gineering Society of the University of Michigan. He was also a member
of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, of Boston; a member of
the American Association for the Advancement of Science; a member of
the American Meteorological Society, and was one of the original Fellows
of the Geological Society of America. He was also a member of the
American Philosophical Society, of Philadelphia. He joined the American
Institute of Mining Engineers in 1871, the first year of its organization,
was one of its managers in 1873, and again in 1889, and was a Vice-
President in 1882-3. He served as a member of the U. S. Assay Com-
mission of 1889. In 1875, Professor Pettee was appointed to the chair of
Mining Engineering at the University of Michigan, and at the time of


his death ranked fifth in length of continaous service as a member of the
Faculty.
The half-tone cut preceding the editorials shows a view of the En-
gineering Society's new room. It is above the Arcade, on the campus side
of the new building, overlooking the Long Walk, and directly across the
hall from the library. The room is finished in weathered oak with high
panelled wainscoting and sumptuously furnished in mission style in weath-
ered oak. At one end is a vault, affording ample room for storing files
and exchanges. A large reading table is graced with all the leading en-
gineering journals, and at one side a new sectional bookcase holds the
modest library of the society. The room, furnished with a large reading
table and chairs, was early this winter turned over to the use of the
members of the Engineering Society and the Michigan Technic Board by
the Engineering Faculty. The Engineering Society has completed the
furnishing of the room, and is now the proud possessor of probably the
finest clubroom of similar character in the country. We read with sym-
pathy and with perhaps some amusement the hopeful words of our pre-
decessors of a decade ago that told of the removal, again, of the reading
room of the society to make room for class work; a remark that ended
always with the trustful assurance that permanent quarters would be fitted
up the next year. The "permanent" quarters have from that time to this
shifted their locality as regularly and surely as frequently as the gypsy
moves his camp. Now that the dream of the past has materialized, we
are proud and grateful that we are here to be benefitted by it, and further,
that we have contributed a little toward greater success and happiness of
the society in future years.
Some notice was given in the last volume of the Michigan Technic of
recent changes in the Department. Last year there were 800 students en-
rolled. At the beginning of the second semester this year the enrollment
has reached the 1,000 mark, and though the new building is now occupied,
the inconvenience of numbers is already being felt. Two floors of the
new building were occupied for class work last spring and, although not
completed, the remainder was thrown open in the fall. Many finishing
touches have been added during the fall and winter, but much remains to
be done before the building can be called complete. This refers more es-
pecially to the laboratories. However, the splendid equipment of the
steam and hydraulic laboratories and of the naval tank are being rapidly
put to place and we may expect them ready for use in the near future. It
may be of interest to graduates of late years to know that the building
wherein they received their entire engineering insruction—now known as
the Old Engineering Building—is, with the exception of the offices of the


secretary and the associate dean, given over wholly to the study of modern
languages. We, as students, cannot help but feel the energy with which
the engineering faculty have met the enormous problem of the last two
years, and must appreciate their extraordinary success in readjusting the
work of the department to meet its new requirements, in that there has
resulted an efficient and harmonious system of engineering instruction
from which we shall all receive lasting benefit.
Though the Technic has now enjoyed an existence of twenty-four
years, and during that time has compared favorably with any other tech-
nical school publication, yet it has not, as have many of these others, en-
joyed the prosperity attendant upon the hearty support of its alumni body.
This is, no doubt, largely the fault of The Technic itself in not pursuing the
policy of the Board of '89, which established a subscription list among our
alumni that promised a bright future for the publication, and certainly
evidenced the loyal spirit of the Michigan graduate. We deplore the fact
that the opportunity was allowed to pass, for there are now technical
school publications upon whose subscription lists are the names of nearly
all their living graduates. It means that the future of such publication is
assured and that its life is not in constant jeopardy, as when dependent
upon the good will of advertisers alone. May we hope that our loyal al-
umni will bear with us now in our effort to give to them in future years
a publication of which they may well be proud.
Since early in the fall, the question of incorporation has been under
discussion in the Engineering Society. Two separate committees have at
different times worked upon it. At last articles of incorporation have been
filed and the organization is now legally known as The Engineering So-
ciety of the University of Michigan. We learn that steps weire taken
toward incorporating the society as many as fifteen years ago, but the mat-
ter was dropped and never revived. The reasons for bringing up the matter
at this time are principally two. For three years past we have experienced
much difficulty and a great deal of inconvenience in shipping and receiv-
ing quantities of exchanges to and from Canadian societies. The whole
trouble lay in the fact that we were not incorporated. Further, the Mich-
igan Technic has of late years reached a stage where it has become neces-
sary to transact considerable business, as has also the society itself. Such
being the situation it was thought advisable to take the step, and we trust
that it will prove of service to future members of the society.
Notice was given in last year's Technic of the formation of a new
Electrical Society here. The organization, however, was not perfected
until this year, when officers were chosen and arrangements completed
making of it a Student Branch of the American Institute of Electrical


Engineers. Prof. George W. Patterson, M. Am. Inst. E. E., is sponsor
for the society. Meetings are held every two weeks at which the more
interesting articles of the monthly "Proceedings" of the American Insti-
tute are read and discussed. At intervals, special meetings are called, at
which members present reports upon their own observations relative to
electric power plants, and similar subjects. The officers for the current
year are: Prof. G. W. Patterson; R. A. Stow, Pres.; L. C. Coller, Vice
President; G. W. Lampke, Recording Sec. and Treas.; J. H. Hunt, Cor-
responding Secretary.
Below is a list of the donations received by the Engineering Depart-
ment during the first semester.

by this means made familiar wth apparatus and appliances with which
they are apt to meet in practice.

GARDNER S. WILLIAMS, C E.
BY PROFESSOR J. B. DAVIS.
Professor Gardner S. Williams was born at Saginaw City, Michigan,
October 22, 1866. He was graduated from the Saginaw High School in
June of 1884 and entered the University of Michigan the following fall.
While still in Ann Arbor, he was employed during the summer of
1887 on water works construction at Bismarck, Dakota, and during the
summer of 1888 on similar construction at Greenville, Michigan, and in
1889 on water works construction at Owosso, Michigan.
He graduated from the University of Michigan in June 1889, having
practically completed his work the previous year, but remaining over for
certain post gaduate work. His first degree was that of B. S. C. E. He
subsequently took the degree of Civil Engineer.
In January, 1890, he entered the employ of The Russell Wheel &amp;
Foundry Company in the capacity of Chief Draughtsman and Engineer.
He remained with them until February, 1893, when he became Chief En-
gineer of the Water Supply System of the City of Detroit under the di-
rection of the Board of Water Commissioners. While with the Water


Board of Detroit he completely revised the system in use not only for
collecting the engineering data necessary in the conduct of the work, but
also handling the general engineering problems connected with that work.
A great deal of new construction work was laid out by him during his
regime and when he left that office, it was considered one of the model
engineering offices of the country.
While Chief Engineer of the Detroit Water Works, he and his assist-
ants carried out a long series of obsevations and experiments upon the
resistances to flow of water in pipes. By these means they gathered a
large amount of information, as well as numerical data, fpr the preparation
of a paper entitled Experiments at Detroit, Mich., on the Effect of Curva-
ture upon the flow of water in pipes. The authors were Gardner S. Wil-
liams, Mem. Am. Soc. C. E., Clarence W. Hubbell, Associate Member,
and George H. Fenkell, Jinuor. This paper, and the discussions follow-
ing it, before the American Society of Civil Engineers, fills 369 pages in
the Transactions, constituting a substantial volume on hydraulics. This
paper was voted the Norman Medal by the committee selected by the
Board of Direction to pass upon the merits of the papers presented for
that year. At different times the rules for its bestowal have been modified,
but perhaps the present wording is as good as any in indicating the basis
of distinction. The award is made to that paper which is "judged worthy
of special commendation for its merit as a contribution to engineering
science." In the older forms of expression the application of the theory to
professional practice is emphasized. Whatever the ideas mav be which
govern the award of the Norman Medal, this paper unquestionably marks
an important date in the investigation of the flow of water in pipes. The
Norman Medal is justly regarded by engineers as our most notable distinc-
tion.
Before, and after, this he published papers of distinguishing merit,
or was concerned in publishing useful data and the results of a successful
experince. Amongst these are the following: "Detroit Tests. Water
Mains in Place,"—1898; "Submerged Pipe at Delray,"—a 72-inch pipe—
1899. This paper presents an account of a special joint used in this
work. "Design of Water Works Distribution Systems,"—published in the
Journal of the New England Water Works Association for December,
1899; "Flow of Water Over Weirs,"—1900. Since 1900 he has presented
useful and suggestive contributions to the discussions of some of the most
important papers and subjects which have appeared before the American
Society of Civil Engineers. That which he contributed to the discussion
of the paper on the Lake Cheeseman Dam and Reservoir relates to his
design for a dam in Six Mile Creek, situated about two imles from the
middle of the town of Ithaca, New York. This is really a paper on a
novel design for an arched dam the thrust of which is carried by the rock


walls and bottom of the canon in which it is built. The design provides
for a dam ninety feet high, about one hundred feet span, and from 8'-6" to
7'-9" thick at its thickest part. In a general way it may be called a dome
dam, though not conforming to the outlines usual in domes. The intro-
duction to this paper calls attention to the use of inverted cones, and seg-
ments of a sphere, as possibly useful forms for guidance in shaping the
general form and thence the design of masonry dams. The criticism
awakened by the startling dimensions above noted, not to mention the im-
pression of aerial masonry which the cross section of this dam at first
makes upon the mind, manifested itself in many way, and in a persistent
endeavor to prevent its construction. Being a public work in the state
of New York the construction was opposed as a defense against an im-
pending public calamity.
As a result of the agitation, an outline of which may be found in
Vol. LIN, Trans. Am. Soc. C. E., p. 197, the dam was carried up but 30
feet. The design of this dam and the pertinent suggestions made intro-
ducing it to the notice of the American Society of Civil Engineers, consti-
tutes another instance of an enlightening, and informing contribution
to engineering knowledge of which the paper upon the flow of water in
pipes was a substantial promise. One may note the widely separated fields
of inquiry in which the work for these two papers was done, although
the connection of dam construction with the practice of hydraulic
engineering, is apparent.
At the present time Professor Williams is engaged in a large water
power development at Sault St. Marie, Mich., wherein are certain elements
of design exhibiting such manifest simplicity and appropriateness as to
command immediate attention.
During his connection with the Detroit Water Works he investigated
the outbreak of typhoid fever in that city. This was in 1892 Its source
was finally discovered to be at Port Huron. This was a most valuable
piece of work, not alone for its bearing upon the health of the City of
Detroit, but also as a piece of scientific investigation. It was the first time
that the transmission of the infecion under such adverse circumstances for
such a distance has ever been established. So desirable were his services
considered by the Water Board of the City of Detroit, that he remains to
this day their consulting engineer and no important move is made without
his advice.
In October 1898, the Regents of Cornell University, offered him the
position of Professor of Experimental Hydraulics. The opportunities for
original investigation seemed to be exceptional, and Professor Williams
finally accepted the position, remaining there until the acceptance of his
present position in the University of Michigan. While in Cornell Uni-
versity, he was unusually successful in creating enthusiasm for his work


by the various students in his classes. Having none of the ordinary at-
tributes of the schoolmaster, and being essentially a man who does rather
than a man who teaches, his success in obtaining the loyalty of his stu-
dents has been most marked. The same success is indicated in his work
so far at Ann Arbor. It was with great regret that the faculty of Cor-
nell saw him depart and they paid him the compliment of allowing him to
nominate his successor. In fact, the same compliment was also paid him
by the Water Board of Detroit, at which time he nominated his assistant,
Mr. Hubbell, who still occupies that position.
Professor Williams was a charter member of the Detroit Engineering
Society, helping to draw up its first constitution. He was also its first
secretary and corresponding member. He enjoyed that position until com-
pelled to move to Cornell. His work for the Society has been so valuable
that no annual banquet is considered complete without his presence. Be-
fore the days of the Detroit Society he was an honored member of the
Michigan Engineering Society where his part and his contributions were
of conspicuous merit. Before those times,—while yet in college,—he, as
much as anyone, worked for, and brought into existence, the Engineering
Society of the University of Michigan. It may be doubted if there would
have been at that time such a society at all had it not been for him. No
one did more than he to make a success of this society. He it was that
named its publication, the Technic. In a similar manner his membership
in the American Society of Civil Engineers has been marked by fruitful
labors,—some of which are referred to above. His connection with any
organization he is affiliated with is always of substantial benefit to that
organization, its purposes, and its work. It would be difficult to name
a person whose worth as a "worker" is superior to his.
While at Ann Arbor, there was no fellow more largely in love with
any of the legitimate sports and pranks, and he was an especially vigorous
class champion. He did not hesitate to do his full share of the "fencing"
or any similar work of that kind, but, on the other hand, he was strenuous
in insisting on fair play and the absence of anything malicious in any
practical jokes.
Perhaps the personal characteristic which is most noticeable is his
high ideal of the moral requisites of an engineer. Knowing that the safety
of life is so often dependent upon the engineer's work, he has no tolera-
tion for the slightest untruthfulness or the slightest laxity of principle or
work in the engineer. He insists that it is a special profession demanding
not only unusual qualifications in the matter of technical knowledge and
originality, but also unusual qualifications in a moral way on account of
the responsibilities lodged with the engineer. While having a ready sym-
pathy for natural deficiencies in the way of lack of ability in others in the


profession, he cannot tolerate the slightest untruthfulness or evasion which
is premeditated. Neither does he believe that the education of the engin-
eer should stop at supplying him with his technical requirements. He
believes that he should be given certain qualifications in the way of gen-
eral information and scholarship. In short, his idea of the finished engin-
eer is not only a man fully equipped in all the engineering and other
technical requirements of his business, but a broad-minded, high-spirited
and well educated gentleman.
The President of the Russell Wheel &amp; Foundry Company, for whom
he was engineer for practically three years, writes that every problem on
engineering that came up seemed a pleasure to him, and regardless of any
work involved, he mastered it. He continues, "I congratulate our Alma
Mater, Michigan, in the hold she has on him and hope she will give him
a clear space and a free rein. A candle of his caliber would burst before
acknowledging being snuffed."
Another gentleman, an engineer, Mr. Alexander Dow, who has had
considerable personal experience with Mr. Williams, writes that the char-
acteristic of Mr. Williams which most impresses him, is the staightfor-
wardness of his engineering method. "He defines the result to be ob-
tained, eliminates unnecessary or immaterial features and takes the most
direct line to the result after a fashion that it is very good to see. He
does not do his thinking "out loud"; is indeed rather silent until his plan
is decided upon. Thereafter, having announced his plan, he has an an-
swer ready for every possible criticism. If I may use the expression,
he is a most comfortable engineer with whom to be associated. He doesn't
weary you with preliminary speculations or with unnecessary details, but
you never find that he has overlooked something that should have been
considered. Such a man does not furnish you with a lot of interesting
incidents. His record is rather that of a uniform good work and atten-
tion to his duty. He has a strong sense of responsibility."
Mr. Wm. A. Livingston, of Detroit, a classmate, who has furnished
much of the information used above says:
"I cannot tell you anything about his parents beyond the one fact
that his mother is a woman of unusual character and a very fine educa-
tion. To digress a moment, I should add one other characteristic which
is very marked also. It is his extreme loyalty to his friends. I want to
impress again one thing very strongly from not only an intimate ac-
quaintance myself, but also from the impression left upon all of his friends
and acquaintances as far as I know. That is, the extremely high ideals
which he has, the strong regard which all of his associates have for
him in a personal as well as in a professional way, and last, but not
least, the fact that only a strong sense of obligation to his Alma Mater
led to his accepting the position there when he had so many professional


calls of a remunerative character outside of university work. Not only
the University, with all of its students, but the people of the State of
Michigan, are to be congratulated upon his selection by the Regents of the

EMPIRICAL FORMULAS FOR REINFORCED ARCHES.

Section showing method of design; on the left, determination of intrados
curve, on the right, arrangement of rods and footings.
During the past four years several hundred concrete arches have
been erected under the writer's supervision, with reinforcement of the
type shown in Fig. I, consisting of a single series of steel rods passing
through the tension regions of the arch rib, that is along the intrados
at the crown and thence crossing the arch rib to the extrados at the
haunches. The point of zero tension where the rods should cross the
arch rib. being rather ambiguous and not readily determined, the alternate
rods of the series are made to cross the rib at relatively higher and lower


points, so that for the region of doubtful bcndfng moments, the arch has
reinforcement along both extrados and intrados. In short the arch rib
is reinforced against all possible bending moments by a single row of
steel rods.
In addition to this reinforcement, the thrust of the arch against the
abutments is resisted by tie-rods from abutment to abutment embedded
in a pavement of concrete laid in the bed of the stream. This pavement
serves the additional purpose of rendering the bridge flood-proof, as
well as providing a solid foundation for the false-work.
This method of reinforcement together with the absolute security of
abutments makes feasible the application of empirical methods of design
that have been wholly impossible with arches of stone and concrete,
except by such methods as those of Trautwine and Rankine which deter-
mine little more than the crown thickness, and that without regard for
loading. From the numerous examples of this type of bridge that have
been erected in spans from 3 ft. to 95 ft. a system of design by empirical
methods has been developed that gives remarkably satisfactory results
for all spans and loadings.
METHOD OF DESIGN.
/. To determine curve of intrados:—Draw an ellipse of the required
span and rise. Pass a segment of a circle through the crown and spring-
ings of the ellipse. Bisect the vertical ordinates between the ellipse and
the circle. Approximate the resulting curve by arcs of circles, adjusting
the curve at the springings to become tangent to the verticals.
2. To determine the crown thickness :—
3S'(R+4F) US' H L
C= + + + 4
4,000 R—S" 30,000 R 30,000 VS
3. To determine curve of extrados:—The curve of extrados is a
C
segment of a circle of radius E=I-| .
5
The extrados circle should be produced to its intersection with the
pavement-ties produced; but if such intersection does not occur within
700 of the crown of the extrados circle, then the back of abutment is
determined by a tangent to this circle at 70° from its crown, this tangent
to be produced to intersect the pavement-ties produced. The base of
abutment should not, however, be less thati one-tenth the span. Piers
should have a thickness of about one-tenth the span,
4. To determine pavement-ties:—

The purpose in designing the intrados curve as above, is to secure
as nearly as possible a linear arch for the given earth loading.
The accompanying views and sections are of reinforced concrete
bridges designed in accordance with the preceding empirical rules. In
hone of these bridges was the loading assumed to be less than 200 lbs.
per sq. ft. or a concentrated load of 20 tons. All of the bridges shown
have been in use for the above loadings for from one to three years, giving
excellent satisfaction.
All arches were erected in concentric rings, of concrete in proportions
of one cement to seven sand and gravel combined. Pavements were
laid in some cases under five feet of water without great difficulty.
Clifty Creek Bridge has solid continuous concrete railings supported
on a spandrel wall twelve inches thick, arid extending about eight feet
back of the wings to serve as guard rails. The wings are built corres-
pondingly lower so that the roadway fill will slope from end of copiiigs
to top of wing at a slope of one and one-half to one. In the view
shown the fill is not complete, but is to be carried to the level of the copings,
Considerable trouble has been experienced by some builders of concrete
arches, in the cracking of the continuous railings, so much so that some
recommend the introduction of frequent expansion joints m the railings.
This has been successfully avoided in this type of bridge by striking
the centers before building the railings, thus allowing the arch to take
its settlement under its loading of earth fill and then after settlement is
complete, building the railings wihout expansion joints.
Contract price for Sugar Creek Bridge was $2,875.00. Cubic yards

Concrete required 265 cubic yards. Steel 9,300 lbs.
Contract price for Yorktown Bridge (following) was $3,885.00. Con-
crete required 390 cu. yds. Steel 21400 lbs.
Sugar Creek Bridge was built in two spans to save cost, the saving
effected over a single span of the same waterway and rise being about
twenty per cent.
In bridges of more than two spans, the pavement-ties would be
omitted from all but the end spans, shice all the other arches are balanced
each by the thrust of the adjacent arch.
In erecting the Yorktown Bridge a rather novel method of striking
the centers was employed. Ordinarily wedges or sand boxes have been
used to release the centers from beneath the completed arch, but in the
centering for this arch no such devices were provided, but the uprights
were so designed that if not braced they would be too light to support
the weight of the loaded arch, yet when braced at two points dividing the
uprights approximately into thirds, they would be abundantly stlrong to
resist buckling. To strike the centers then it was ohly necessary to
remove the bracing and the uprights would buckle beneath the weight of
the arch allowing the arch to settle gradually and to develop fully without
jar to the stresses in the arch rib. This method enables the settlement
of the rib to be kept under perfect control. After buckling, the uprights
are driven out one by one, or cut out.
The cut opposite is that of a reinforced concrete arch with flood-
proof pavement in bed of stream, three miles east of Peru, Indiana.
The arch was erected in August, 1902, and passed through the severe
flood of July of the following year. The arch was submerged to a depth
of ten feet and the earth roadway was carried away, but no damage
whatever resulted to the arch. A steel bridge half a mile up stream, its
abutments undermined, was washed away and lodged against the arch
as shown in the above view. The arch is a twenty ft. span waterway
with six ft. clear height of opening.


SOME RESULTS OF RESEARCH WORK ON FORT-
LAND CEMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.
BY E. D. CAMPBELL, PROFESSOR OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING, UNIVERSITY OF
MICHIGAN.
The mechanical part of the manufacture of Portland Cement has been
briefly but quite satisfactorily described by Professor Carpenter in his
article on The Manufacture of Portland Cement, which appeared in the
Technic, Vol. 17 for 1904. The manufacture of Portland Cement is a
strictly chemical process, since it involves complete change in the rela-
tions between the materials going to make up the clinker from which the
cement is produced by grinding. The three essential constituents of
Portland Cement are silica, alumina and calcium oxide or lime. Ferric
oxide, magnesium oxide or "magnesia," the alkalies potassium or sodium
oxides, and sulphuric anhydride are usually present but are not essential
constituents, although they may exert a marked influence during the
formation of the clinker or upon the physical properties of the finished
cement.
It has been stated by one of the most eminent authorities in Germany
that Portland Cement can be made from any clay or shale with any lime-
stone or marl, provided the amount of magnesium oxide is not too high.
While the above statement in general use is true, it does not mean that
Portland Cement of equally good quality can be made from any kind
of raw material. When the Portland Cement industry began to assume
such an important place in this state, the author realized that it would
be necessary to have a much better knowledge of the conditions which
determine the constitution of clinker before the industry could be put
upon a really satisfactory basis. Although thousands of physical tests
had been made upon finished Portland Cement, in very few cases was the
complete history of the clinker, from which the cement was made, known;
that is, in very few cases was the complete chemical composition of the
clinker, the temperature at which it was burned, or the length of time
and conditions under which it was kept before making into briquets or
test bars, stated. The physical properties of the finished cement will
depend primarily on the constitution of the clinker, and it was for this
reason that the researches, begun in this laboratory in the spring of
1899, had for their object the study of some of the conditions which go
to determine the constitution of the clinker.
The first experiments undertaken were performed in small stationary


furnaces and produced clinker very similar to that made in large com-
mercial fixed kilns. Experiments were carried on for something over a
year, using a stationary furnace, but it soon became evident that the tem-
perature of the furnace and the duration of the heating were two factors
in the process of clinkering which were of nearly as great importance
in determining the constitution of the clinker as the chemical composition
of the clinker itself. In nearly all modern cement mills the rotary kiln
is employed and it therefore became desirable to have a small rotary fur-
nace, in which the temperature could be accurately measured, the time
of passage of the material controlled, and the chemical composition of the
gases constituting the flame from the furnace determined. After some
months of experimenting, such a small rotary furnace was constructed
and most of the cements made in this laboratory during the past four
years have been burned in this furnace. The temperature within the fur-
nace is measured by means of a modified La Chatelier pyrometer, easily
sensitive to less than one degree when working at the highest tempera-
ture employed in making clinker, something above iooo°C. A full de-
scription of this rotary cement kiln for use in the laboratory can be found
in the Jour. Amer. Chem. Soc, March, 1902.
When a satisfactory form of furnace had been devised, a preliminary
set of experiments was planned to determine the influence of variations
in chemical composition of the raw mixture on the temperature required
for producing sound cement. To this end, mixtures were made from
clays or shales with marl in such proportions that the influence of the
substitution of Alt Ot for SiOt, of Fe, O. for Alt Oj, of MgO for CaO,
and of increase or decrease in the basicity of the mixture could be studied.
Each raw mixture was passed through the rotary kiln and samples of the
clinker were collected beginning with a comparatively low temperature,
usually about iico°C. and increasing in intervals of 25 to 30°C. until a
temperature was reached known as the "overburning" temperature at
which the material became so soft and sticky that it would not pass
through the furnace. The various samples of clinker collected during
each experiment were ground into cement and the amount of watet" for
"normal consistency" and the time for initial and final sets determined.
The pats made in the course of the determination of the time of setting
were after standing in moist air twenty-four hours, placed in cold water
which was then brought to the boiling point and maintained at that tem-
perature for a second twenty-four hours. This "boiling test" served to
give an excellent indication as to the soundness of the cement.
We desire to discuss more fully the phenomena connected with the
clinkering as indicated by the soundness of the cement shown by the
boiling test. A comparative study of the soundness of the pats after
having been subjected to the action of boiling water for twenty-four


hours shows most clearly the relation existing between the chemical com-
position and temperature of burning. In any series the successive pats
show differences in behavior in boiling water. If the collection be begun
below about 12500 C, the first pats will come loose from the glasss soon
after making, but will become quite strong and remain sound and free
from cracks under the boiling test. As the temperature of burning rises
the pats begin to crack more and more, then go to pieces, and finally nearly
or quite completely disintegrate. With further increase of burning tempera-
ture, the extent of disintegration diminishes until, if the cement is properly-
proportioned, the pats again become sound and strong, remaining firmly
attached to the glass. Further increase of temperature does not affect the
soundness of the pat, unless carbon monoxide is present in the furnace
gases. In this case the pat may come loose from the glass but will remain
sound and strong.
For purposes of study three points have been selected as indicating
important changes in clinker. Such changes in condition of clinker may-
indicate formation of definite chemical compound or changes in the phases
of a solid solution. The three points selected are, first, temperature of
maximum disintegration, by which is meant the temperature at which
the clinker was produced which, when made into pats, showed the great-
est disintegration in boiling water; second, temperature of perfect boiling
ti-st. by which is meant the lowest temperature at which clinker was pro-
duced which, when made into pats, remained strong, free from cracks
and firmly adherent to the glass after exposure to boiling water for twenty-
four hours; third, m&gt;crburning temperature, by which is meant the lowest
point during the burning at which the individual pieces of clinker com-
menced to stick badly to each other or to the inside of the furnace. The
influence of chemical composition will be discussed with reference to these
three temperatures.
Temperature of maximum disintegration. For a given clay the ratio
CaO to SiOi+AU Os must reach a certain magnitude before the pats will
completely disintegrate. Any increase in the calcium oxide over this
minimum amount for any given clay does not increase the temperature
of maximum disintegration. The temperature of maximum disintegra-
tion is lowered by increasing the time of passage through the furnace.
When the ratio CaO to SiOa+AU 0&gt; is enough for complete disintegration,
the addition of MgO does not change the temperature of maximum dis-
integration. The substitution of R«0« for SiOt materially raises the tem-
pertature of maximum disintegration. For a given clay, the amount of
water required for normal consistency increases with increase of CaO
provided the time of passage through the furnace is kept constant.
Temperature of perfect boiling test. For a given clay the burning
temperature necessary to obtain a perfect hot test increases with increase


of CaO. This temperature is lowered by increase of time of passage
through the furnace. When the ratio of CaO to SiOa+AUOa is enough
to insure a perfect boiling test at some temperature, the addition of MgO
does not materially raise the temperature necessary to obtain clinker
giving a perfect boiling test. The substitution of R»Oa for SiO« lowers
the temperature for a perfect pat when the ratio of CaO to acidic oxides
is low. With increasing amounts of CaO the temperature for a perfect
hot test is increased and the point is soon reached when a perfect hot
test cannot be obtained at all. The amount of water required for
normal consistency varies within slight limits, but does not rise over
25% irrespective of the clay used and the composition of the cement.
Overturning temperature. For a given clay the overburning temper-
ature increases with increase of CaO. The overburning temperature
is lowered by increasing the time of passage through the furnace.
MgO may replace CaO molecularly up to an empirical formula,
2RO. SiO», 2RO. AltOj, 2RO. Fe.O», without much change in overburn-
ing temperature. When the CaO is at least 2CaO. SiOj, 2CaO. AliO«,
2CaO. Fe»Oi, the addition of MgO raises the overburning temperature
only slightly, not nearly so much as an equivalent of CaO.
Viewed from the standpoint of the influence of chemical composition
upon the changes in temperature necessary to produce a sounkl cement
and the temperature at which the clinker will give trouble by sticking in
the rotary, we find that the minimum temperature to produce Portland
Cement which will give a perfect pat test from fresh clinker is about
I4S0CC. This temperature is for a minimum amount of CaO. It in-
creases with increase of CaO until in ordinary commercial cements it
reaches isso°C. With the most heavily limed commercial cements this
figure would be somewhat higher. It depends somewhat on the length
of time required to pass through the rotary, slow driving tending to
lower the temperature. The substitution of AUO« or Fe»Oi for SiOi,
that is the use of a richer clay lowers the overburning temperature re-
quired for a perfect boiling test. With mixtues low in CaO the burn-
ing temperature for perfect boiling test is lowered by this substitution,
but with mixtures high in CaO the burning temperature required for per-
fect boiling test is raised and may become coincident with the overburn-
ing temperature. Any attempt to raise the overburning temperature by
increasing the proportion of lime will fail to give a perfect hot test even
at the overburning temperature. This is a confirmation of manufacturing
experience—that with lean clay heavily limed, there is a wide margin
between the proper clinkering temperature and the overburning temper-
ature, while with rich clays in order to prevent the clinker from balling
up, great care must be exercised to maintain the proper clinkering temper-
ature. With the amount of CaO found in ordinary cement, the intro-


duction of 8 or 9% of MgO has but little influence on the temperature
for perfect boiling test or overburning temperature. So far as the clin-
kering is concerned, magnesia, as has been maintained by Newberry, acts
as an inert substance. The details of the experiments from which the
above deductions are drawn will be found in the Jour. Amer. Chem. Soc,
October, 1902.
During the following year a set of experiments was made to determine
the influence of the fineness of grinding of the raw material upon the
clinkering process. The material employed was a raw mixture used by
one of the Lehigh Valley Cement companies. Twenty-five samples of
clinker were made from this material used just as it is ordinarily fed
into the large rotaries used at the works. The temperature at which
these samples were collected ranged between 10000 C. and i62S°C. An-
other set of twenty-four clinkers was also collected at approxiamtely the
same temperatures as those employed in the preceding cases, the only
difference being that in the second set of experiments the raw material
was ground so that 98% would pass a two hundred mesh sieve. The re-
sults of these experiments showed, first, that unless the material is finely
ground, a perfect boiling test cannot be obtained even when the material
is burned at over i6oo°C; second, that the process of clinkering takes
place in several steps which are indicated by well marked changes in the
amount of water required for normal consistency, in the time of initial
and final sets, and in the behavior of the pats under boiling tests; third,
that witli finely ground raw material such as is used in the Lehigh Valley
district, a perfect boiling test can be obtained with clinker burne&lt;i at
I475°C. The details of these experiments together with photographs
illustrating the changes of color of the clinker with increasing tempera-
ture and the appearance of the pats after having been submitted to the
boiling test, will be found in the Jour, Amer. Chem. Soc, November, 1903.
The marked changes in the behavior of the clinker produced in the
previous experiments indicated that these changes in the time of setting
and behavior under the boiling test were probably due to changes in the
chemical relation between the CaO and the SiOj, A\£), or FeiO». In
order to determine whether this was probably the case, other experiments
were carried on during the following year. These experiments included
the preparation of mono and di-calcium aluminate, di-calcium ferrite and
a cement made from mechanically mixed oxides. As in previous experi-
ments, samples of clinker were collected at various temperatures and
tested to determine the amount of water required for normal consistency,
the time of setting, and the behavior of the pats under the boiling test.
The results of these experiments were tabulated, plotted in the form of
curves and compared with the results obtained in the previous work.
A study of the curves for the finely ground Lehigh Valley material shows


that the amount of water required for normal consistency falls off regu-
larly with increase of temperature after the point necessary for complete
dissociation of calcium carbonate has been passed, in this case about
II25°C. If we compare the curve for the initial and final sets in this
experiment with those from dicalcium aluminate and dicalcium ferrite,
we will note that in all three cases we find the final sets reaching a mini-
mum at a temperature very near 1200° C. and that the initial set is rapid in
all three cases at this same temperature. This would indicate that in
cement, mixtures of dicalcium aluminate and dicalcium ferrite were prob-
ably the most reactive constituents formed at this temperature. The very
marked slowing of the final set between I200°C. and I300°C. is probably
due to some silicate formation, since this marked rise in the curve is
absent from the curves of pure aluminates and ferrites. The sample
of clinker collected at 1352°C. showed, as has been previously explained,
maximum disintegration under the boiling test, together with a minimum
amount of undecomposed silicates. Thus we would find this second
valley, so to speak, in the curve of final set representing that period in
the process of clinkering where we have most complete combination of
the silica ,but where the (n'-calcium silicate, characteristic of normal
Portland Cement has not as yet formed, or at least separated from solid
solution. The rise in the curve between I3S2°C. and I475°C. is not
improbably due to the gradual separation or formation of tricalcium
silicate, perhaps accompanied by progressive dissociation of dicalcium
aluminate and ferrite. The temperature at which the first perfect boiling
test is obtained is I475°C. Whether the gradual falling off in the time
of final set with rise of temperature above I475°C. is due to dissociation
of tricalcium silicate and formation of the more quick setting dicalcium
silicate, we are not prepared at this time to venture an opinion, since
our work has not as yet reached a point which would justify positive
opinion in regard to the behavior of the silicates themselves.
The experiments upon the cement made from mechanically mixed
oxides showed that if a mechanical mixture of the various oxides consti-
tuting the raw mixture is finely ground it will after a temperature of
I200°C. is passed behave in practically the same way, so far as the clin-
kering process goes, as if the SiOi and AlaOs had been combined as a
silicate in the raw mixture. The details of these experiments with the
curves are given in the Jour. Amer. Chem. Soc, September, 1904.
Comparatively early in the course of the researches begun in this
laboratory, the author realized that it would be very desirable to have
some positive information as to the cause of expansion in cement. It has
been a matter of common knowledge for years that different cements ex-
pand to a different degree under the same conditions, but there has been
a marked divergence of opinion as to the causes of these differences.


Magnesia has been the material blamed for most of the expansion,
although free lime also comes in for its share of blame. A long series
of experiments was therefore planned with a view to throwing a little
light on this vexed question of the change of volume in cement. A num-
ber of bars were made from cement of known history, that is, from clinker
of known composition, burned at a known temperature, cooled at a known
rate, and stored either as cement or clinker for a known length of time
before making into expansion bars. These expansion bars are each 25
mm. square and 100 mm. long between the glass plates imbedded in the
ends of the bars. Their initial length is measured by means of a special
micrometer graduated to .01 mm. and capable of being read to .001 milli-
meter. Since the length of the bars is 100 mm. the expansion or contrac-
tion may thus be read directly in per cent. The initial measurement is
taken twenty-four hours after the bar is made arid subsequent measure-
ments to determine any change in volume are made at intervals of seven,
fourteen, twetny-one and twenty-eight days, two, three, four, six, nine,
twelve and eighteen months, two years, three years and subsequent meas-
urements at the end of each year. The results of these measurements
are being kept in tabular form, as well as in curves and will be published
in due course of time . There are at present something over ninety bars
from which these data are being collected, some of them already having
been under observation for over four years. Although the results of these
experiments have not as yet been carefully collated, a few interesting
facts seem to be pretty clearly indicated. First, the expansion due to
MgO depends not upon the total amount of MgO but upon the condi-
tion in which it exists. Chemically combined MgO does not cause ex-
pansion in cement. Free MgO does cause expansion, this expansion,
however, not being appreciable for nearly two months, but continuing,
when the bars are kept in water for more than three years. If the bars
are kept in air, it is questionable whether free MgO causes any appre-
ciable alteration in volume. Free CaO causes rapid expansion of bars
kept in water, the expansion due to the presence of free CaO ceasing,
however, after about fourteen days. If the bars are kept in air, fvee
CaO causes steady expansion extending over a period of several months.
If expansion bars are made from freshly burned clinker either from a
commercial rotary furnace or in the laboratory kiln, there is an irregular
expansion for more than two years. If the cement from which bars are
made is stored, the expansion of bars kept in water is markedly decreased,
while if the clinker is first exposed to the weather for some months and
the cement produced therefrom aged for a few weeks, the expansion of
bars immersed in water may be reduced to practically nothing.
The conception that at the temperature of the kiln, clinker consists
of a solid solution from which certain constituents may crystallize out,


is steadily gaining ground among those interested in the study of the
chemistry of cements. This idea was, we believe, first suggested by
Erdmenger and about the same time by Ludwig in 1901. In an exhaus-
tive article on the constitution of Portland Cement, which appeared in the
Journal "Cement" Vols. IV, V. and VI., Clifford Richardson has care-
fully reviewed the literature concerning the ideas held by the leading
cement chemists abroad and in this country and has elaborated upon the
idea of clinker consisting of solid solution, giving his own theory as to
the probable composition of the different constituents going to make up
the clinker. The influence of the temperature and time of heating on
the constitution of the phases existing in clinker has not as yet been
satisfactorily established. The work done in this laboratory during the
present year has had for one of its objects an attempt to throw a little
light on this question and the work will be continued in hopes of contrib-
uting something that will be of use in the solution of the problem.

STRESSES IN DAMS AND DAM FOUNDATIONS.
BY GEO. Y. WISNER, '65, M. AM. SOC. C. E., CONSULTING ENGINEER, THE UNITED
STATES RECLAMATION SURVEY.
The problem of determining the stresses in dams, and in the side
walls and foundations of the structures, arising from the internal and
external forces to which subjected, is one which has received careful
consideration of many of the best engineers of the past century, yet the
formulae given in text and reference books for computing such stresses
are far from being satisfactory.
The attempt to generalize formulae for the solution of such prob-
lems is almost certain to be of little value except for conditions identical
with those on which the formulas were based.
The local conditions governing the stresses which are likely to be
generated in such structures vary to such an extent that the formulae
usually given for determining them, gives results little better than a good
guess.
It is usually stated that the assumptions made are on the side of
safety. This, however, is by no r.ieans satisfactory, for while engineers
may guess at a design they feel confident is absolutely safe, they may there-
by expend thousands of dollars in making the structure massive, without
increasing its stability.
The first duty of the engineer in making designs for such a struc-
ture, is to demonstrate beyond all question that it will be safe under
all the internal and external forces to which it can be subjected, and
that its parts are so proportioned that no unnecessary expense will be
incurred by the construction of features which will not add to the
stability.
The stresses which will be developed in a long straight masonry dam
are entirely different from those in a short straight dam, and both are
different from those in a dam of the arch type. In a long, straight ma-
sonry dam the tensile stresses developed by a fall in temperature in the
structure are such that in many cases the stability of any section depends
almost entirely upon the weight and shape of such section.
Good concrete will contract or expand about 1/200,000 for each de-
gree change of temperature, while the expansion of good building stone
varies from 1/175,000 to 1/500,000 per degree.
A masonry structure having a coefficient of expansion of .000005, and
a modulus of elasticity of 3,000,000 will develop tensile stresses of 15


23
pounds per square inch for each degree fall in temperature, or over 21
tons per square foot for a temperature 20 degrees lower than that at the
time the masonry was constructed. This condition indicates very strongly
that the upper portions of such structures should be constructed when
the temperature is below the normal for the location for which designed.
The formula; given in most reference books for determining the
stresses in dams of different dimensions, are generally for those requiring
a gravity section,—or for long straight dams,—but it is also generally
assumed that if safe for long dams, such gravity sections will be more
so for short, straight dams and for arch dams, and therefore they have
been adopted for such structures, when in fact, equally stable structures
could have been erected at much less cost.
The assumptions made in developing these formula; are by no means
in accord with the conditions which exist at any site where the founda-
tion material is suitable for supporting such structure, viz.—the dam
is assumed to be absolutely rigid and the foundation on which it rests
perfectly elastic.
With these assumptions results are obtained which indicate that
when the forces acting on the dam cause the resultant to cut the base
one-third the width of the base from either face, the diagram of upward
pressures in the foundation is a triangle, which in actual practice is gen-
erally far from being the case.
If a b c be a section of a rigid
structure resting upon a perfectly
homogeneous elastic foundation, the
diagram of pressures on the foun-
dation will be approximately a rec-
tangle when reservoir is empty. If
the foundation material is not hom-
ogeneous, the points of greatest
pressures will be those offering the
greatest resistance to compression.
If these points be near the center
of the base, the diagram of pres-
sures will be convex, and if near the end of base a and c the diagram
will be concave showing a greater pressure at those points than at the
center d.
If a structure of this nature be founded upon a pile foundation, the
form of the diagram of pressures will depend upon the sustaining power
of the piles under the respective parts of the section considered.
In case the material of the foundation is compressible with no shear-
ing strength at the faces a and c, the structure will settle until the
resistance of the foundation to compression is equal to the weight of the

F/6./.


structure; but if the material of the foundation is continuous horizon-
tally, and elastic, the pressure from the weight of the structure will be
resisted by the elastic forces in the material of the foundation and by the
shearing strength at the points a and c.
If the material of the foundation be supposed to be cut by planes at
the points a and c, the material under the structure will be compressed
directly in proportion to the weight of the structure per square foot of
the base, and inversely, as the modulus of elasticity of the material.
With a structure having a weight of 100 pounds per square inch
on its base, and a modulus of elasticity of 3,000,000, the foundation will
be compressed 0.1 inch in 250 feet of depth, if free to act without shearing
resistance at a and c. This compression will be resisted by the shearing
strength of the material at a and c, and therefore, if as assumed, the
structure is rigid, the greatest upward pressures under the base will be
at a and c and the minimum at the center d.
The difference in these pressures will depend upon the modulus of
the material and upon the resistance to shear, and therefore the upward
pressures under the base can not be estimated until these elements are
known. Any theoretical determination of such pressures based upon
assumed conditions, cannot be otherwise than worthless and misleading.
The assumption that the structure is rigid is also far from being cor-
rect and may lead to dangerous results.
The material of which dams are generally constructed will compress
practically the same as that of the foundation, and in a symmetrical sec-
tion like that shown in Figure I, the maximum pressure will be at d,
and the minimum at the faces a and c,—or the reverse of the result ob-
tained if the structure be assumed absolutely rigid and resting upon an
elastic foundation.
Taking into consideration the elastic and compressive characteristics
of the material and the resistance to shear in the foundation strata, it is
safe to consider the pressures from its weight alone, under the base of
a structure having a symmetrical cross section, as practically uniform.
The compression and bending of the foundation strata will tend to make
the surface concave and the compression of the material near center of
structure will make the base of the structure convex.
The more nearly rigid the structure is made, the greater will be the
pressures at the faces.
In the case of a dam of ordinary gravity cross-section with -resultant
line of pressure cutting the base one-third the width from either face,
the load will be supported in part by the elastic forces in the founda-
tion and partly by the upward shearing forces at the heel and toe of the
dam developed by the part of the load supported by the foundation strata
outside of the base of the structure. It is therefore evident that the


static pressure at the toe of a dam of ordinary theoretical gravity section
is much greater than shown by the formula in text books, m which
formula the effect of the shearing strength in the foundation is neglected.
A foundation suitable for supporting a high masonry or concrete
dam must have great supporting strength and be continuous for some
distance above and below the structure. The weight of the dam will
not be carried entirely by the material of the foundation immediately
under the base of the structure, but will be distributed through the strata
above and below by the bending action produced by the slight compres-
sion of the rock directly under and adjacent to the structure.
In long straight dams, especially where changes of temperature are
likely to produce heavy tensile strains in the masonry, the section must
be made sufficiently massive to withstand external pressures by gravity
action alone, but in the case of short dams, whether straight or arched
in plan, the distribution of both internal and external stresses aire greatly
modified, and in many cases the width of the structure may be decreased
without danger to its stability.
In the construction of a masonry or concrete dam, a foundation
course 40 feet to 50 feet in depth is usually put in place for the entire
length and width of the structure, which in a short dam, when thoroughly
set, becomes a rigid beam, slightly compressive under heavy loads.
When the superstructure is completed, the pressures from the load
are transmitted to the base and to the side walls by the foundation
course. The mid-stream section of the dam can not compress the amount
that it would if free to move, on account of the shearing stressos developed
at the side walls by the beam action of the lowter portion of the dam.
The static pressures on the foundation from weight of the dam are more
evenly distributed throughout the entire width of the base than is the case
in long dams, and instead of being zero at the toe when the reservoir
is empty, the pressure there may be nearly as much as at the heel.
The assumption that the diagram of pressures under the base of a
dam is triangle with zero pressure at the toe when the reservoir is empty
requires that the section under consideration is free to move. In short
dams this is not the case, and any such movement will create bending
moments in the lower part of the dam impossible to ohtain with the loads
to which subjected.
The lower portion of a short dam is little more than a massive
wedge between the walls of the gorge which the dam closes, and if of
sufficient width to safely withstand the shearing stresses to which sub-
jected, it will be just as stable as though made with a massive gravity
section. For such dams the arch type of structure is best adapted for
transmitting the pressures to the side walls.
In designing such structures, careful consideration must be given


to the effect of change of temperature of the structure, which may develop
greater stresses in the masonry than those due to the water pressure on
the face of the dam.
The lower portion of the dam which is massive, protected from the
sun, and saturated with water, will have but a small range of temperature
for the entire year, while the upper portion, which is thin and exposed,
will have a wide range.
The results of these conditions are that in the summer season the
upper portion of such a dam is under heavy compressive strains and in
the winter it is subject to equally strong tensile strains.
These forces have a tendency to give the crown of the arch at the
crest of the dam a slight movement up and down stream, but since the
lower portion of the structure is not subject to these changes of temper-
ature, the movement produces bending moments in the vertical sections
of the dam, which, if not reenforced with steel, may result in horizontal
cracks in the down stream face, and vertical cracks through the upper
part of the structure.
Attempts have been made to eliminate the effect of these movements
by making the vertical section of the dam an arch, but this is of little
importance for the reason that the base of the structure is not subject
to any great range of temperature and is therefore practically stable.
The general use of the same shape of section for short dams of the
arch type as that designed for long dams requiring a gravity section
is open to criticism, for the reason that the up-stream pressures due to
the changes of temperature of the upper portion of the dam, may exceed
those down-stream due to the water pressure on the face of the dam.
Tn short dams of arch type, a better distribution of pressures will
be obtained by decreasing the batter on the down-stream face and in-
creasing it on the up-stream face.
Investigations now in progress indicate that the safest and most
economical construction for short dan-.s of the arch type at sites where
the rock in the foundation and side walls is continuous and solid, is a
structure having sufficient width at the base to be absolutely safe from
shear under all forces to which it can be subjected, and with the upper
portion of the dam so reenforced with steel as to be free from danger
of cracks from bending moments and from temperature strains.


NOTES ON SUPERHEATED STEAM IN ENGINES
AND TURBINES.
BY J. R. DIDIJINS, &lt;)0, WEST1NGIIOISE MACHINE CO.
Does it pay to use superheated steam in steam power plants, i. e., can
we assure a customer that he will not only save a definite percentage of
his coal pile, but that he will also come out ahead when all capital
charges are deducted from the gross saving?
In order to determine the ultimate commercial value of superheat, not
only the gross saving in water or coal must be taken into account, but also
the standing expenses or fixed charges upon the investment, and for main-
tenance of the superheater equipment. In the following balance sheet the
most important items are mentioned:
DEBIT. CREDIT.
Extra coal required for firing super- Net saving of coal.
heater. Reduction in size of boiler equip-
Extra labor required. ment required.
Taxes and Interest on investment in
superheater, extra piping, and in
extra building space.
Depreciation and maintenance.
It is true that all these debit items are not usually taken into account,
and in fact capital costs are frequently omitted alogether from the cost of
power. In this case the net showing made by superheat will be much
greater. The argument for superheat usually ends with the statement that
a saving of (10%) in steam consumption can be secured by employing 100°
superheat with a coil superheater installed in the boiler setting. Some
builders even go so far as to say that this type of superheater does not
take any extra coal for firing, as does the independently fired superheater.
This statement is evidently misleading, and the efficiency of transmission
of heat in the one type should be practically the same as in the other. If
the superheater is installed in the path of the hot gases of the boiler, either
the capacity of the boiler is reduced or a hotter fire must be carried to
make up for the extra heat put into the steam heat.
In spite of the excellent results obtained through the use of highly or
even moderately superheated steam in steam motors, particularly steam
turbines, it is an unfortunate fact that practically no reliable data exists
by which the above question can be definitely answered, i.e., quantitatively.
The effect of superheat upon the steam consumption of reciprocating
engines (see Fig. I )is in general the same as with turbines, viz.: for a
given horse power less water is required according to the degree of super-

heat. This is due to the fact that the volume of a pound of steam
increases with the superheat, as well as its internal heat energy, and also

that the extra heat in the steam serves to prevent condensation and other
heat losses in the cylinder, or at least to reduce them. This extra heat
also defers to a later stage in the expansion cycle the "dew point," i. e.,
the point where the steam becomes saturated and moisture begins to form.
Steam expanding from 150 pounds pressure to 28" vacuum has approxi-
mately 23% moisture in it as it passes to the exhaust, provided that no
heat is taken in or given out during its passage through the engine, i.e.,
adiabatic expansion.
In the reciprocating engine this ideal expansion is departed from, due
to many complex and variable losses such as condensation and re-evapora-
tion at the beginning and end of the stroke respectively. But it is believed
that in the turbine, as these losses do not occur, the steam expansion is
practically adiabatic, to which may be attributed to a considerable degree
its higher economy.
Now, if extra heat be put into the steam initially, by superheating,
this extra heat renders a direct service; in the engine by compensating for
some of the initial heat losses; in the turbine by retarding the "dew point"
further on in the expansion range. It thus occurs that with sufficient initial
superheat the entire 23% of moisture which results from expansion may
be compensated for, and dry steam may be secured thirough the whole
turbine.
The beneficial effects of superheat in the turbine are of somewhat dif-
ferent character than those in the engine. In the latter severe thermal
losses occur, as noted above; in the turbine the losses are probably more

of a mechanical nature due to the friction of the steam moving at high
velocity over the internal superficies exposed to it. The denser the steam
and the higher its velocity, the greater is the resulting friction. Being
of much lower density than saturated steam—in fact approximating the
state of a perfect gas—superheated steam greatly reduces the internal
friction in the machine; with a commensurate increase in economy. To
show how serious this friction may become in an impulse turbine: A test
by Dr. Lewici of Darmstadt upon a 30 h. p. De Laval turbine disc running
first at atmospheric pressure and then in vacuum. The turbine was driven
by a calibrated motor and, in order to bring it up to running speed,
power was required as follows, expressed in per cent, of the capacity of
the turbine. This is disc friction alone—not jet and bucket friction:

RESULTS—STEAM CONSUMPTION.
Turbine Tests.—The effect of superheat in a turbine is shown by
Fig. 2. The line OC represents the total water peT hour at different


loads with saturated steam. The line OD represents the total water per
hour at different loads with superheated steam. The divergence between
these two lines, therefore, represents the effect of superheat, viz.: For
a given degree of superheat the water saved is in direct proportion to
the load, or in other words, the percentage saving is practically constant
at all loads. This latter point is well brought out by Fig. 3. The lines
A, B, show the decrease in steam consumption per brake h. p. for differ-
ent loads and degrees of superheat; they are practically parallel. For
this reason, the per cent, increase as shown by the line OX is practically
constant for any load. This test shows that for 50° superheat the per-
centage reaches 5%, for loo", 10% and for 150°, 15%. Above ioo0 this
test and other tests show that the percentage increase falls off somewhat,
similarly to the overload line at the point Xi. For this reason, guar-
antees of the higher superheats are made conservative enough to cover
possible variations.
En'Cixe Tests.—The results of the use of superheat in the engine are
«hown in Fig. I and the data in the following table I.
Engine 3 shows the best results, viz.: 9 pounds of steam per in-
dicated h. p. hour, but it must be borne in mind that this was obtained
with 28" vacuum and 2430 superheat. This may be considered as high
an efficiency as has ever been obtained in engine work, but even under
these extremely favorable conditions the unit consumed 11.2s pounds of
steam per electrical h. p. hour; assuming a generator efficiency of 95%
it comsumed 10.7 pounds per brake h. p. hour.
By way of comparison, note that the turbine tested by Messrs. Dean
&amp; Main, shown in Fig. 3. gave a brake water rate of 11.15 pounds with
180° superheat. By increasing the superheat 630 the economy would prob-
ably have increased by at least 5%, which would bring the turbine water
rate to 10.6 pounds per b. h. p., which fully equals that of the engine.
Note engine No. 5, a triple expansion engine of the Willans centiral
valve type. With 200° superheat the steam consumption was 10.9 pounds
per horse power hour at full load and with high pressure and high vac-
uum. Referring again to our turbine, with 200 extra superheat the steam
consumption would have been about 10.9 pounds, practically the same
as the Willans engine.
Column 10 in this table shows the per cent, decrease in steam con-
sumption, i. e., the increase in economy due to 1000 of superheat, assum-
ing that these quantities are proportional to the superheat. The average
is in fair agreement with results from turbines, but the wide variations
show that the gross saving due to superheat in engine work varies largely
with different designs.
It must be borne in mind that such results as these obtained with re-
ciprocating engines are seldom maintained in regular service owing to the

These data appear to indicate a general saving at the coal pile in
reciprocating engine plants. With turbines we may only infer that the
saving is perhaps smaller, but more definitely assured.

•Avg. temperature of gases at superheat, 716° to 842° F.
No information is at hand regarding the capacity of the plants or the
rating of the superheaters. In plants Nos. 4 and 5, which have been in
service from seven to eleven years, no repairs have been reported . As this
is somewhat improbable I have estimated them as shown in parenthesis.
Covering a number of plants which have been in service for many years,
and coming from an evident authority on the subject, this data is valuable
in showing that the depreciation in a properly constructed superheater is
much smaller than is generally thought.
TROUBLES.
It must not be inferred from the good character of the results here
presented that the use of high superheat is to be universally recommended.
The net saving in dollars at the coal pile is one thing; the ability of the
plant attendants to cope with the problems arising in the use of superheat
is another. For this reason the policy of recommending superheat univer-
sally is a poor one and should be modified by a full consideration of the
following points:
The use of high temperature implies greater expansion of all metallic


parts subjected to it. This, is is true, may be allowed for in the turbine
by proper designing, and in the piping by great care and judgment in their
arrangement, but it is also true that the difficulties in the control of super-
heat and the maintenance of uniform steam temperatures are greatly in-
creased. The fireman must watch his fires much closer than before ,and
if he is at all negligent the superheat, even with a constant load, is liable
to vary from 150° or 200° F. to o or even to wet steam. Such extreme
variations in temperature are sure to result sooner or later in creeping
of piping, opening of joints and serious injury to engine or turbine.
One or two accidents to turbine plants have arisen from this cause.
At the high temperatures more expensive pipe covering must be used
or else heat losses increase rapidly. It is also found difficult to maintain
tight joints and tight valves in the steam lines, due to high expansion.
In the design of several turbine plants, separators have been dispensed
with, anticipating the use of superheat. Invariaby at one time or another
large quantities of moisture have found their way to the turbine, checking
its speed. The fact that no permanent injury has apparently resulted has
encouraged forgetfulness of the severe dynamic stresses which must have
been exerted upon the turbine blading in order to suddenly absorb the
enormous rotative inertia of the moving parts.
These are points which distinctly involve the so-called personal ele-
ments in power station design and operation. They cannot be expressed in
dollars and cents, but are nevertheless of the utmost importance, as must
be evident .
With intelligent operatives and proper means for controlling the super-
heat, beneficial results may be secured, but with ignorant and careless
operatives and hap-hazard engineering the situation points to saturated
steam from a standpoint of safety.


GROWTH OF THE ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT
SINCE 1890.
Probably in no school of any other profession has the increase in
attendance been so phenomenal as that in engineering schools during the
last three years, a.matter which has created considerable comment in the
press. The general conclusion reached seems to be that the phenomenon
is a direct result of a corresponding incease in the demand for technically
educated men. This demand comes not alone from purely engineering
fields but from commercial and industrial concerns as well. There is an
increased awakening to the fact that in these times of great enterprises
and enormous business undertakings, the men who best appreciate the
problems that arise and grasp the details of management are those who
have technical training. This fact, coupled with the great industrial
growth of this country in the last few years undoubtedly explains the in-
crease in the demand for technical graduates.
At Michigan this rate of increase has been unusually rapid and at
the suggestion of one of our alumni, thinking that such would be of gen-
eral interest, we have compiled data from which the accompanying curve
has been constructed. It is of double interest, not only in showing the
exceptionally rapid growth in attendance during the last four years, but
indicating how closely technical study follows the industrial prosperity
of the country, thus emphasizing the conclusion drawn above. The de-
cline in attendance for a few years following 1894 is readily explained
by the industrial panic of those years; and following the panic the curve
conforms closely to the gradual increase in activity, up to the unparalleled
prosperity of the present time.
Michigan met this sudden increase in attendance with a spacious new
building and splendidly equipped laboratories. The building was partly
occupied for class work a year ago and is now practically completed.
Its laboratory facilities are exceptionally fine. The steam laboratory occu-
pies two floors and a sub-basement of the north wing and nicludes a


boiler room in an adjoining wing. The hydraulic laboratory occupying
half the basement of the north wing and a portion of the upper floors, is
equipped with apparatus and facilities for hydraulic investigations of
laboratory occupying the basement of the west wing is finely equipped with
every • character. Heads as high as 600 feet are obtained. The electrical
both direct current and alternating current machines of various designs and
has additional laboratories for research work including photometry and the
telephone. Probably the most interesting feature of the new equipment is
the naval experimental tank extending the length of the east wing, a dis-
tance of three hundred and fifty feet. It is now practically complete and
ready for use. As this is the only experimental tank in the country except-
ing that of the government, the results of investigations carried on here
will undoubtedly be awaited with interest.


SOME RAPID ENGINE REPAIRS.
BY G. D. BRADSHAW, 04, JUN. AM. SOC. M. E.
It must be remembered that the repairs of which I shall attempt to
give some short account are entirely on rolling mill engines, and in a
rolling mill or steel mill the element of time is all important. The motto
of the mechanical department is "keep the mill running," and all otHer
considerations are secondary. A few minutes' delay in otae department
is likely to delay several others, and may mean a good many dollars to
the company. For this reason spare parts are carried in stock to a much
geratcr extent than might be advisable in other plants. The greater
the variety and number of spare parts the shorter the delay when some-
hing does give way, as it simply means the taking out of the broken
piece and replacing with another. Thus repairs which would seem to
be extremely rapid in general practice arc quite common in rolling
mill work.
Nearly all the small engines, say under ioo indicated horse power,
which are used for driving the rotary pumps, etc., are in duplicate, as
are the air compressors, steam pumps, table engines, etc., so that the only
delay when one breaks down will be the few minutes required to change
over. Such a delay will not amount to over five or six minutes at the
outside.
One day not long ago the head end high pressure exhaust valve
broke on a tandem compound Porter Allen 42"x75"x66". When the
engine stopped and the covers had been removed, it was found that the
valve was broken in half a dozen pieces, and that some of them were
missing. This necessitated removing the steam covers on the low pres-
sure cylinder, and the remainder of the valve was found in the low
pressure steam chest. The spare valve was then in the machine shop,
completed with the exception of facing off the ends and drilling the hole
for the valve stem. The work was pushed as rapidly as possible, the
valve taken to the engine room, put in and set. The covers were replaced
and the engine started, with a delay to the mill of three hours and ten
minutes.
Not long after, this same engine blew out a receiver joint next to
the low pressure steam chest. This meant breaking another joint to
get at the first one. The surfaces were scraped, new gaskets cut, the
elbow lowered into place and bolted up. A total delay of three hours
and fifteen minutes was charged against the engine.
One of the rod mill engines is a 4o"x68"x6o" tandem compound


Corliss, with a Nordberg valve gear, and runs at 86 R. P. M. The
steam and exhaust reach rods vibrate considerably, and we have had
quite a little trouble due to their breaking. This means quite a little
delay, as they usually take some others with them. September last the
steam reach rod broke, also breaking a governor rod, the steam hook-up,
and a low pressure governor bracket. They were replaced with spares,
delaying the mill one hour and five minutes. When the reach Tod broke
some time later it took with it only a governor rod, with a delay of
twenty-five minutes.
At another time the pin in the steam arm which carries the dashpot
rod broke. In taking off the steam arm to .replace, the head broke off
the key, and the key had to be drilled out. This delayed the engine
one hour and forty minutes.
It was only a few days ago, though, that there was another break-
down on this same engine. This time it was caused by some studs from
the high pressure piston going through the exhaust valves. It happened
about three o'clock Saturday afternoon, both valves were broken beyond
repair, and there were no spare ones. A mold was made up from what
could be found of them and two new ones were cast and machined.
They had to be marked off in place, as it was found that the valve
stems were badly twisted. In fact one was twisted about ninety degrees.
The key ways were then cut, the valves set, and the covers put on.
In the mean time several studs had to be drilled out of the piston with an
air drill, and the broken parts of the valves and studs removed from
the receiver. The engine was started Monday morning about one o'clock
—a delay of about thirty-four hours.
In conclusion I will give an instance of the rapid Installation of a
2000 horse-power horizontal-vertical Corliss engine, and of a repair job
on it. It is an engine having a sixty-ton fly-wheel twenty feet in diame-
ter, and is direct connected to the rolls in a "three high" mill. An old
vertical single cylinder engine was used previously, and when a new
engine had been decided upon the new foundations were started around
it, the plan being to utilize most of the old ones also by means of drill-
ing out holes and putting in rag bolts. When the new foundations had
set and the new ehgine had arrived, the old one was shut down and
removed, no attempt being made to save anything but the cylinder and
some of the rods. The horizontal-vertical was then erected and started
up as soon as completed, the total time the mill was shut down for the
change being nine days. That is the quickest work of that kind that has
come under my notice.
Some time afterward the crab, connecting the engine shaft to the
rolls, broke and wedged under the shaft. This threw up the shaft,
breaking every spoke in the fly-wheel, both caps to the bearings, the


main casting of the outboard bearing, and forcing the crank disc about
W off the shaft. A telegram was sent to the Allis-Chalmers Co. to cast
a new fly-wheel; the old one was removed by blowing out the keys with
dynamite; the outboard bearing was patched with heavy boiler-plate, and
new caps were cast for both bearings. The shaft luckily was not sprung
as was at first supposed, and an attempt was made to force the disc on
with heavy jacks, but after breaking several this was abndoned. Blooms
with holes in them were placed across the face of the disc and end of
the shaft, and six inch rods were placed through them, heated in the
center, and the slack taken up with the nuts. Then they were cooled
off and shrunk. The six inch rods broke, and seven inch were substituted.
These held, and the disc came slowly on, an eighth of an inch at a
time, until it was finally in place. By this time the fly-wheel had come,
and the engine was put together and started just two weeks after the
accident.


APPARATUS USED


FORCES IN DRILLING.
THESIS BY W. S. DREW, '97, AND E. C. STRUCKMAN, '97.
While the object in the work was to find the "Forces in Drilling," time
and the apparatus available limited us in the investigation. Only twist
drills were used. The few experiments made with different angles of the
drills do not permit of making any definite statement as to which is the
best. The overhead drill press used was not altogether satisfactory, as it
was impossibble to exceed a speed of twenty revolutions per minute with
a three-fourths inch drill in steel, on account of the slipping of the belts
and stopping of the machine. On this account, the investigation of the
effects of the differen speeds of the drill was abandoned. The only feed
used was one two-hundredths inch per revolution.
The apparatus used in all the drilling was that designed and built by
Mr. H. C. Buell, '96, and may be briefly described as follows. (See Fig.
I.) The apparatus consists of a round vertical shaft, to the upper end of
which a face plate similar to the face plate of a lathe is screwed. The
metal to be drilled is clamped to the face plate. The shaft is held in a
vertical position by two ball-bearings; one at the bottom, which takes the
thrust and side strain at the bottom, and the other near the top which
takes the side strain at the top. The torque is transmitted from this shaft
by an arm fastened to it, and which presses against a vertical arm of a
bell-crank lever, the other arm of which, in turn, presses down on the
torque scale. This apparatus, together with the toque scale ae placed on
the pressure scale. The pressure scale is then placed so that the drill
comes directly over the metal to be drillled. The pressure is then trans-
mitted through the shaft to the pressure scale. The toque in all the work
was weighed with a small Buffalo scale of 145 lbs. capacity. For fast drill-
ing this did very well, but for the large drills and a speed of 20 R. P. M.,
the scale was too sensitive.
The pressure was first measured on a 1000 lb. Fairbanks scale, but this
was replaced by a 1000 lb Buffalo when the pressure became too great for
the smaller scale. Up to the 54th drilled hole, the drills were ground by
hand but after that all drills were ground on a drill grinder manufactured
by the Washborne shops of the Wocester Institute. This grinder sharpens
the drills at an angle of 59 degrees. For the experiments with different
angles of drills, the drills were ground by hand on an emery wheel.
The material used for the bronze test was a casting 4"x4"xi2" cast in
the University foundry. The casting was quite homogeneous but stilll the
torque and pressure scales showed variations caused by hard and soft


THE MICHIGAN TECH NIC.
spots in the casting. For cast iron a casting of the same size as for the
bronze was used. The wrought iron was 3"xi"xl2" and the steel was a
soft open hearth steel, 6"x6"x6".
Readings were taken every half inch depth drilled, and as the holes
were drilled .V/2 inches deep in the bronze and cast iron, seven readings
were taken for every hole. Three or more holes were drilled with each
drill in order to secure good average values. In the steel, a depth of 5'/j
inches was drillled with 1%, \i/^ inches, and I inch drillls and a depth of
three inches with the smaller drills. Readings were taken every one-fourth
inch depth drilled, after the 105th hole. Lard oil was used with all the
drilling in wrought-iron and steel.

Table I, gives the averages of results of the expermients in bronze.
The column headed "Torque" is the torque as read from the scale. The
Ft.-lbs. of the work were obtained in the following way: For the pressure,
the distance moved through per Rev. is one two-hundredths inches or
I
feet.
12x200
Then the pressure multiplied by the ft. per rev. is the ft.-lbs. of the
work per revolution. The point of the application of the torque is as-
sumed at one half the radius of the drill. Then, the circumference of
the circle having a radius equal to the half radius of drills is the dis-


tance moved through per revolution. The torque is measured at a dis-
tance equivalent to ten inches from the center of the drill. This was
obtained in the following way: a piece of board was clamped across
the face plate and a string tied to the board passed through a small
pulley on the same level as the face plate. Standard weights were sus-
pended from the string. The pull on the string multiplied by the per-
pendicular distance of the center of the face plate to the string is equal
to the pressure on the torque scale multiplied by the lever arm of the
apparatus. The average value was found to be 10 inches.
Multiplying the torque, as read, by 10 reduces it to one inch radius.
These readings were then reduced to the half radius of the drill. This
result multiplied by the distance moved through gives the ft. lbs. of the
work. This is obviously the same as would have been obtained by multi-
plying the torque as read by the circumference of the circle of 10" radius.
For example: The average torque for the five-eighths inch drill in bronze
was 5.3 lbs. The half radius of the drill is 5/32", ■ .5-3X10X32/5=339
lbs. at 5/32" radius. The circumference of the circle having 5/16" diam.
is, o".&lt;j8i75. •.0.98175X339/12=27.73 ft. lbs. The pressure is 139 pounds.
1
139X =0.057 ft. lbs. per rev. These values might have been plotted
200X12
instead of the pressures and torque. They would give curves of the same
form.
The curve sheets show the pressure and the torque plotted. The
diameters of the drills are taken as ordinates and the pressures and
toque as abscissas. Curve sheet I shows that the pressure increases as
the size of the drill in all cases. The pressure increasing more rapidly
in cast iron than in bronze and yet more rapidly in wrought iron and
steel than in cast iron. There is very little difference between the
wrought iron and the steel. The wrought iron being a little greater.
Curve sheet II gives the torque plotted with the diameters of drills as
ordinates and the torque as abscissas. Here the points fall on the curves
which vary with the material. Thus the curvature increases from cast
iron to wrought iron and steel. The curve for bronze is very flat. It
appears that for a bronze of a certain composition the curve might be
a straight line.
It will be seen that quite a number of points do not come on the
lines drawn, and especially is this so with the one-inch drill. This drill
was found to be too small at the point and did not have sufficient clear-
ance to keep it from binding. The effect of the binding is shown by the
torque being too large. It was found that there was a torque of 8 lbs.
or 42 ft. lbs. per rev., when the drill was about 3 in. deep ini bronze
but not cutting. The pressure being at the same time low is probabJy
explained by the fact that the cutting tool was less than one inch diameter.


The uncertainty of reading the scales correctly, the slipping of belts,
and the irregularities in the metals all tended towards errors. In order
to eliminate these errors as much as possible, a machine has been de-
signed which furnishes a continuous register of both torque and pressure,
thus eliminating errors of observation.

ELECTROLYTIC RECTIFIERS.
THESIS OF E. A. WEILAND, '04, AND O. W. VISSCHER, '04.
Owing to the limitations of time and equipment, it was thought inad-
visable to attempt to prove or disprove any of the many theories which
have been advanced from time to time to explain the action of the alumi-
num electrode. Inasmuch as the electrical engineer is more especially
concerned with the results to be obtained from the use of such a cell, it
was decided to make a test of the cell from a commercial standpoint; to
approximate as nearly as possible to the conditions which must be met in
actual practice, and detrmine in this way, what may be expected from this
device in its present state of development.
With this end in view, correspondence was entered into wth parties to ccuL/uren

having such cells on the market, and information was obtained as to the
details of construction, various kinds of electrolytes, temperatures, current
densities, etc. These directions were carefully followed in carrying out
the experiments ,and the efficiencies were determined by actual measure-
ments of both input and output. A large number of new electrolytes were
tested, some of which gave very good results.
The method of procedure in investigating a solution was as follows:
First, it was subjected to a direct current break-down test, to determine its
break-down voltage, and relative conductivity. A great many solutions
were tested in this way. These tests gave a basis from which to judge
the merits of a solution as a rectifying medium.
In performing the D. C. break-down test, the apparatus shown in
Fig. 1 was used. A current at 220 volts was passed through a high resist-


ance to which were connected mercury cups at frequent intervals. By con-
necting to these cups any desired voltage could be obtained by steps of
three volts. An ammeter to detect currents and a volt meter giving the
impressed voltage were connected as shown. A pole changing switch made
it possible to reverse the current and thus obtain the relative conductivity
in the "open" direction, when the current was flowing from neutral to
aluminum.
In conducting a test the voltage was first increased gradually until
the solution broke down, and the voltage noted. Then the voltage was
dropped to o and increased again, reversing, however, at each step to the
break-down point. This was usually somewhat lower than the first break-
down voltage. This process approximated the treatment with an alternat-
ing current. Some solutions/ which gave a high break-down voltage and
fair conductivity were very sluggish in returning to the original voltage
after having been reversed, and were on this account unsuited to act as a
rectifying solution. Other solutions polarized very much and gave a large
"capacity spark" when the circuit was closed after having had a high
voltage impressed upon them. These would also be unsuited for a recti-
fier.. Below is a partial list of the solutions tried:
Sulphuric Acid: Breaks at 20; conductivity good. As it is diluted
the voltage rises to 38 with 1% solution, but the resistance is then high.
Ammonia: Ten per cent solution. Breaks at 69; conductivity very
poor.
Ammonia and Sulphuric Acid: Give a voltage which increases with
the percent of ammonia. With 10% of Sulphuric Acid and 25% Ammonia,
it breaks at 31.
Phosphoric Acid: Breaks between 70 and 100; conductivity rather
poor; very sluggish.
Ammonium Phosphate: Breaks between 185 and 205; conductivity-
good; very quick and little "capacity spark."
Double Salt of Potassium and Chronium: Breaks at 52.
Potassium Nitrate: Breaks at 8.
Bicarbonate of Soda: Breaks at 180; conductivity very good. Quick.
Potassium Cyanide: Breaks at 80; conductivity good.
Potassium Alum: Breaks at 57; conductivity very poor.
Acctric Acid: Breaks at 30.
Potassium Ferrocyanide: Breaks at 60.
Ammonium Carbonate: Breaks at 124; sluggish and has large "capa-
city spark."
Boric Acid: Breaks at 100; very high resistance.
Oxalic Acid: Breaks at 100; fair conductivity; slow in action.
Tartaric Acid: Does not break at 220 volts; rather high resistance.
Oxalic Acid: Breaks at 100; fair conductivity; slow in action.

Tartaric Acid: Does not break at 220 volts; rather high resistance.
Sodium Acetate: Breaks at 100; good conductivity.
Sodium Phosphate: Breaks at 190; good conductivity.
As the object in view was to find a solution for high voltage com-
mercial work, the required voltage of 100 to no A. C. eliminated all but
four of these solutions: Ammonium Phosphate, Sodium Phosphate, Sodium
Bicarbonate, and Tartaric Acid. Of these the Ammonium Phosphate and
Sodium Bicarbonate solutions gave the highest conductivity and quickest
action. These were therefore selected for the alternating current testR.
In the direct current tests, too, the effect of different neutrals, lead,
iron, and carbon was tried, but without finding any appreciable difference.
As lead was most convenient to use, it was selected for the A. C. tests.
A test was also made to determine the effect of temperature on the
break-down point; but, contrary to the statement of some experimenters,
thc ecu


little difference was noticed at temperatures below 8o°C. This test was
made on Ammonium Phosphate.
When a cell is withstanding a heavy pressure, brilliant sparks appear
at points on the aluminum plate and especially at the surface. These
soon affect some change at this point and the cell gives way. By insulat-
ing the aluminum at the surface of the liquid much more uniform results
were obtained.
The A. C. tests were made with the cell shown in Fig. 2. The neu-
tral point on the winding of the generator. Two aluminum plates were
used, one connected to each terminal of the alternator. By connecting
in this way the generator supplies direct current all the time, instead of
allowing one-half of the wave to pass through and holding the other
half back and giving current only half the cycle, as it would if the ter-
minals of the generator were connected one to lead and the other to
aluminum.


THE MICHIGAN TECH NIC.
These plates were placed in the position shown and held }4" apart,
by the cover made of strips of wood boiled in paraffin. The aluminum
plates were covered with rubber to a point below the surface of the
solution. The whole was suspended in a glass jar containing about a
quart of solution. As the break-down point did not seem to be much
affected by the density of the solution, while the conductivity increased
with the density, concentrated solutions were used in every case.
In the A. C. tests, current was obtained from the alternator, at a
frequency of 60 cycles and at any desired voltage up to 300 volts. The
load on the cell in the preliminary experiments consisted of incandescent
lamps. By this means the cell could be subjected to any desired voltage
and this applied voltage held constant through all ranges of load or the
load could be kept constant while the applied voltage was varied. Thus
it was possible to determine accurately the best voltage as well as the best
current density for each electrolyte.
The set up used in all efficiency tests is shown in Fig. 3. The neutral
point of the generator winding is connected through a watt meter and
D. C. ammeter with a bank of lamps and from there to the lead. This
watt meter gives the total output of the cell, while the ammeter gives
the average rectified current. Both an A. C. and a D. C. volt meter
were connected across the load; and the ratio of their readings gives
the form factor of the current. As the windings and connectings of
generator and cell were symmetrical, it was sufficient to use a watt
meter on only one line, which measured one-half of the input into the cell;
an A. C. volt meter was connected between neutral and one aluminum
plate, giving the voltage over half the cell.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC.
Curve No. I is such a load test on Sodium Bicarbonate. In this run
the applied voltage was held at 75 volts, while the load varied from 6 to
1620 watts. This curve shows clearly the way the efficiency of this devise
holds up at light loads. This is very striking inasmuch as all other sys-
tems of conversion of alternating into direct currents are extremely in-
efficient at like loads The curve shows also the limitation as to capacity,
since a cell 8x6x254" can rectify only 1.5 kilowatts. It is therefore evi-
dent at once that these cells will never be used to convert large currents
in practice. Its field will be limited to small individual requirements
such as the conversion of alternating electric lighting currents to charge
storage batteries, automobiles, and the like. This curve shows also the
direct E. M. F. available at various conditions of load. This electrolyte
gave the very best results of any tested, and.is, as far as we can learn,
a discovery of our own.
Curve No. 2 is a voltage test of the same electrolyte, which shows
that up to 90 or 95 volts A. C. the efficiency remains very good, while
above that voltage the cell breaks down and the efficiency falls off very
rapidly. This electrolyte would do admirably for a no-volt circuit for
automobile charging.

were considerably at variance with those published by the inventor. The
cell is costly, is difficult and uncomfortable to operate because of high
temperature and the disagreeable fumes it gives off, and gives poor re-
sults. The efficiency is low and the voltage it can withstand is lower
still in comparison with liquid electrolytes. Moreover, the increased cap-
acity claimed by the inventor is not sufficient to enable it to be used in
transforming large currents.
To investigate how the cell would work in charging a storage battery,
with a constant counter E. M. F., the cell was run so as to oppose the
E. M .F. of a D. C. generator run separately excited By varying its field
any counter E. M. F. desired could be obtained.

Curves No.'s 6, 7 and 8 were obtained from tests in which the
cell was used to furnish current in opposition to a direct current generator
of the Edison type. Curve No. 6 is a test of the Bicarbonate Solution
with the Edison run at a constant electro motive force of 65 volts, while
the voltage applied to the cell was changed It is noteworthy that current
was given to the Edison when the voltage applied to the cell was 5 volts
below that of the Edison. This is due, of course to the fact that the maxi-
mum alternating voltage is much higher than the alternating volt meter
reading, and the pulsating direct E. M. F. exceeded the direct steady E.
M. F. for a sufficient length of time in each cycle, to make the current
average positive. The efficiency was practically constant at voltages be-
tween 75 and 90 above which it was not possible to go because of the
heating of the cell due to the large current which the cell forced through
the Edison against its E. M F. By thus increasing the voltage applied
to the cell, enough current was driven through the Edison to run it as a
motor, and to furnish current to the mains through the motor, which had
previously driven it Hence it is evident that the pulsating current
furnished by the cell can be used without difficulty for driving all kinds
of D. C. motors without change.
Contact curves were taken to determine the shape and character of
the rectified current waves. These are of special value both to determine
whether the current flowed at any instant in the negative direction and to
investigate the angle of lead.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC.
Curve No. 9 was taken over a bank of lamps as a load and shows
the shape and phase of the rectified current. During the test the voltage
over one-half the alternator was kept constant at 75 volts Curve I is the
E. M. F. curve of the generator at no load. Curve II gives the E. M. F.

over the lamps at a light load of two lamps. The input is 80 watts and
the average D. C. voltage 66.6 volts. Curve III is for a load of 182 watts
8 lamps and 61.5 D. C. volts. Curve IV is for a load of 280 watts 15
lamps and 59 D. C. volts. These curves show a much flatter top than the


E. M. F. curve. None of them cross the zero line, though they approach
it more nearly as the load increases. They show approximately equal
angle of lead, of about 320, if anything the angle increases with the load.
Curve V is the E. M. F. curve over the lamps with all the lamps turned
off, or practically with the volt meter as load. The E. M. F. varies but
very little and is all the time higher than the impressed The explanation
for this fact is that the cell charges as a storage battery at the peak of the
E. M. F. wave and then discharges through the high resistance of the
volt meter.
Curve No. 8 gives the E. M. F. curve over the Edison Machine .No.
8 (a) was taken under the following conditions; A. C. Volts 74; D. C.
Volts 74; Watts input 30; and D. C. Ampere 0.24. Curve (c) was taken
under these conditions; A. C. Volts 90; D. C. Volts 55; Watts input 320;
D. C. Amperes 2.05. Curve (B) was taken over the Edison machine run
as a motor through the cell. A. C. Volts 83; D. C. Volts 33; Watts input
625; and D. C. Amperes 6. These waves all have very flat tops. The
voltage rises until sufficient to overcome the counter E. M. F. of the
dynamo and just enough more to cause current to flow through its resist-
ance and can go no higher. The irregularities are probably due to im-
perfect contact in the contact maker.


THE STABILITY OF CHIMNEYS.
PORTION OF THESIS BY R. C. STEVENS, 95, SUPERINTENDENT ATLAS IRON WORKS,
INDIANAPOLIS, IND.
Chimneys to be stable must be designed so as to fulfill the following
requirements:
The area of any bed joint, or stage, must be sufficiently great to re-
duce the unit pressure due to the dead load to within safe limit depending
upon the material used. There must be no liability of any portion of the
chimney being overturned by the greatest wind that may be encountered.
This maximum wind-pressure should not increase the crushing strain
at the edge of any joint beyond the safe bearing value of the masonry.
Vibrations induced by gusts of wind should not cause the overthrow
of the chimney.
DEAD LOAD.
The unit pressure at any stage will be regulated by the weight of the
masonry and by the diameter at the section or thickness of the masonry.
W
p\——. The weight per cubic foot of brick masonry is variously given
A
from ioo lbs. to 14s lbs. Trautwine and Baker use 125 pounds for
medium quality. Rankine uses 112 pounds. The latter value is on the
safe side and has been used in the following calculations. Stone masonry


61
varies from 125 pounds to 165 pounds per cubic foot. A usual value
for p\ in brick chimneys is 75 pounds per square inch, although many
chimneys are standing, and are probably quite safe, where £1=150 pounds.
The pressure on the foundation may be determined in the same manner.
It varies largely with the nature of the soil or rock, ranging from one-
half ton per square foot for quicksand, or alluvial soils, to 200 tons or
over for the hardest rock in native beds.
The problem of stability against the overturning action of the wind
consists simply in the equalization of moments. The moment of the
weight about the leeward edge of the joint must equal, or exceed, the
moment of the wind pressure with reference to the same point. The lat-
eral pressure of the wind may be assumed, without appreciable error, as
acting horizontally, and of uniform intensity at all elevations. More-
over, the inclination of the side of a chimney to the vertical may be
neglected.
Suppose /&gt;i (Fig. 1) to be the
uniform intensity of the dead
load, which is distributed over
the cross-sectional area A.
When the wind blows the pres-
sure increases toward the lee-
ward side of the joint and de-
creases toward the windward
side; and this variation load
due to wind pressure, or the so-
called Dynamic load, has an intensity at the leeward edge of f=pi its in-
tensity at the windward edge will be equal to —p, provided the section is
symmetrical, as is usually the case wth chimneys. Then f=zpi= the max-
imum allowable additional pressure due to the action of the wind; other-
wise there will be tension in the masonry on the windward side. Al-
though the mortar might withstand considerable tension when dry, it
could not do so when wet, and the chimney must be built to stand at
and from the beginning. There must be no possibility of a bed joint open-
ing at its windward edge. It is therefore customary in practice to make
no allowance for the adhesiveness of the mortar, and to limit the values
of f as above stated.
The total pressure at leeward edge (Pm«»)=^/&gt;i=-^.
Total pressure at windward edge (fmi«)=o.
The value of Pn« must never exceed, or even approach dangerously
near the ultimate strength of the masonry at any joint, or the ultimate
bearing power of the soil at the foundation.
Whatever then is assumed as the allowable value of Pm««, p\ will
equal one-half fm.», for maximum wind pressure.

then pass through b. This condition, however, is impossible from practical
consideration and from original assumptions. The resultant can shift only
part way toward b before f—pi. q is the factor which represents the frac-
tion of the diameter over which the resultant has moved when f=pt. It
may be varied evidently for different shaped cross-sections by substituting

Wind Prsssuee.
The greatest intensity of wind pressure, pw, against a flat surface
has been about 60 lbs. per sq. ft. The chance of tornadoes cannot
be considered in calculating most structures, so it would seem that 50 lbs.
per sq. ft. is a reasonable value to assume in practice.
This value, and even 40 pounds, is commonly used by engineers in
this country.
The total wind pressure against the side of a circular chimney, if
found by resolving the wind current, normal to the surface, and integrating,
will equal one-half that against the side of a square chimney of the same
diameter. This is the value assumed by Rankine and adopted by many
others. However, the flow of wind cannot be considered as that of a
steady current It comes in gusts and it may be shown mathematically
that its pressure on a cylindrical surface, on this assumption, is two-thirds
that on a flat surfcae. Hexagonal and octagonal chimneys may be con-
sidered as lying between square and round chimneys.
Therefore we may take the following values for pw in the above equa-
tion.
pw may=50 lbs. per sq. ft. for a square chimney.
=38 lbs. per sq. ft. for hexag. chimney (0.75x50).
=35 lbs. per sq. ft. for an octag. chimney (0.7x50).
=30 lbs. per sq. ft. for a round chimney (0.6x50).
Or instead, we may consider 50 lbs. per sq. ft. acting on the whole area
of a diametral section in a square chimney, and 50 lbs. per sq. ft. on a given
fraction of that area in the othetr cases. In any case the left hand member
of equation (A) and (B) is to be multiplied by the following factors:
1 for a square chimney.
0.75 for a hexagonal chimney.
0.70 for an octagonal chimney.
0.60 for a round chimney. .
In other respects a hexagonal or an octagonal chimney may be considered
like a round chimney, with only a small error on the safe side.
Having determined the maximum, safe value of pwtor the different bed
joints in a given chimney, that joint which allows the least intensity of
wind pressure, or which gives the least moment of stability, is the "joint
of least stability." In small chimneys it usually comes quite near the
bottom. In large chimneys, some half the distance up.

weights.
The following method of calculating the weights and areas is slightly
modified from the way proposed by Mr. George B. Wilcox. It com-
mends itself for its great simplicity of arrangement.

THE SHELL.
The total weight of any section of the
shell (Fig. 3) of uniform thickness, /,
equals W, equals the volume in cubic feit
~*&gt; times w.
Volume equals H' times area of mean
cross-section.
Assume batter equal a feet in one foot
(Fig. 5). Then by similar triangles
i/a=H,/x :■ x=aH'.
The increase in the dameter, D", for a
\f.. . \.. \..fy distance of H' down, will be equal to 2X—
an//'.
Hence diameter, D, equals D"-\-2aH'.
FOR SQUARE CHIMNEYS.
The area of mean cross-section (Fig.
4) equals mean perimeterX', equals
4t (f+t) equals 4t (e—t).
Hence f=e—2t=[D"+i/2(2aH')\—at.
=D"+aH'—2t.
Substituting in the above
Area of mean cross-section equals

Weight of section, W,=4wH't(D"+aH'—t).
Area of base of section, A,=4t(D"+2aH'—I).
Intensity of Pressure due to Dead Load, pi=W/A.
It is to be observed that if the batter be expressed as / ft. in y ft.,
then a~i/y and may be taken at once from a table of reciprocals.
FOR ROUND CHIMNEYS.
The area of a mean cross-section (Fig. 6) equals *t(f-\-t) equals
rt(e—t). Thus it is merely necessary to substitute » in the place of 4 in
the above equations. We have then W=*wH't(D"+aH'—t).
A-=*t(D"-\-2aH'—I) which are capable of the same logarithmic
treatment.
THE CORE.
If the chimney has a separate core, its weight may be similarly cal-
culated, having due regard for the algebraic signs of the quantitiesa//'
and 2aH'. If the flue is vertical the equations become simplified.
For a Square Vertical Flue.
A\ equals 4ti(fi-\-ti) equals 4li(d-\-ti).
IV'i equals wH'iAi equals 4%vH'iti(d-\-ti).


For a Circular Vertical Flue.
A\ equals *ti(d-\-h).
Wi equals wfi'iAi.
Hexagonal and octagonal shafts may be treated like circular shafts.
Many contend that the weight of the core should not be considered in
figuring stability, but that the shell should be alone strong enough to resist
the action of the wind.
It is true that the core is built separate from the shell, so that the ex-
panson may not endanger the solidity of the shell; however buttresses,
generally eight in number, are usually built up on the inside of the shell,
which merely abut against the core; and the moment the wind has inclined
the chimney even to a slight degree, the whole mass—shell, buttresses and
core resists by its weight that action of the wind. But, as the brickwork
of the core is liable to become injured by the heat, it is best to make the
shell of sufficient thickness to resist alone the additional load, /, due to
the action of the wind. So the entire weight may be considered to resist
the tendency toward increase of pressure on the leeward edge, and that
increase of pressure may be considered as distributed over merely the
cross-sectional area of the shell.
Should there be a core, d in equations (A) and (B), may still be
taken as the diameter of the flue at the joint under consideration without
sensible error.
Calculation of a Given Chimney.
The problem of calculating the stability of a given chimney consists
then simply in determining the entire weights above the successive bed
joints and then the intensities of the pressure upon the several cross-sec-
tional areas at the joints. Then the proper values may be substituted in
the equations (A) or (B) and the resulting equation solved for /&gt;», which
will give the maximum permissible intensity of wind pressure at the several
joints. The smallest value of p» will determine the joint of least stability,
the value of f for a given intensity of wind pressure (say 50 lbs.) may
pip-'
then be found from the equation /'= , where pi is the intensity of
P»
dead load in the shell; and the values of P&gt;«»* and Pmi. at once follow.
If PmiL is not negative, and if P»n is well within the ultimate strength of
the masonry or earthen foundation, the chimney may be considered safe.
The safe value of Pmi for common brickwork is variously estimated at
from 10 to 20 tons per sq. ft. or from 140 to 280 pounds per sq. in.
Designing a Chimney.
The problem of chimney design is not quite so simple. The questions
at once arise:
What will be the best proportions for maximum efficiency and maxi-


mum economy of material together with sufficient stability?
Should the chimney be circular or square?
What batter should be used?
What relation should the height bear to the diameter?
H. F. Fairbairn says, "The same rules may be given for the building
of chimneys as for the proportions of columns; that one-half the diameter
should be diminished between the base and the capital; that the length of
the shaft should be 8 times the diameter of the base; and that the chimney
should be circular in every part." Artistic effects and ornamentation can
be of only secondary importance, and stability and economy must be the
determining factors in construction.
Best Shape of Cross-Sf.ction.
The great preponderance of opinion seems to be in favor of the round
chimney. The reason for this decision may be briefly outlined as follows:
Round chimneys with equal flue area have a shorter perimeter of cross-
section than square chimneys and therefore offer less surface for the radia-
tion of heat and the infiltration of cold air. It has already been shown that
circular flues offer less frictional resistance. But the most important con-
sideration is that a circular chimney requires the least amount of material
in its construction, the truth of which appears self evident. Moreover, a
circular shaft offers less hold for the wind.
It may be proven mathematically that a circular shaft is more stable
than a square one of the same height.
It seems that we might safely assume a round chimney to be 20 per
cent, more stable than a square chimney of the same external dimensions
and 30 per cent, more stable than one of the same height and capacity and
this assumption moreover is strengthened by an observation of chimney ac-
cidents. It may therefore be given as a general rule that for a chimney over
four or five feet in diameter the circular form is the best. Below this
diameter the bricks for a round chimney have to be especially moulded,
so that it becomes more economical to use the square, or better, the octag-
onal form.
Batter.
It is reasonable to suppose that a chimney should not be vertical in
outline, but should have some batter. This becomes evident if the chimney
be considered as a beam of uniform strength.
Case I. Chimney Considered as Round. With the Thickness of the
Walls Uniform and Small in Comparison With the Diameter, with a Load
Uniformly Applied. (Fig. 7).
The equation for determining the dimensions will be

which is the equation of a cone.
Or chimney should have a straight conical batter.
Case II. Chimney considered as Round. With the Thickness of

Its equation will then be

or Cy'=X', where C is a constant; which is the equation of the semi-cubical
parabola. Or chimney should have a hollow batter nearly straight at the top
and increasing in concavity as the ground is approached. It will be noticed
that this equation corresponds to equation (B) (p. 62), for, substituting in
the above, D for X, d for x, and the value

The shell of a chimney consists of a series of sections one below the
other, the thickness of each being uniform, but increasing in thickness
downward from division to division. If, therefore, each section be built
with a straight batter and the batter be varied from section to section, we
may approach the theoretically correct shape for a chimney. Several
changes of batter may thus be made on the taller chimneys, while small
chimneys may be built with a straight batter of from 1/16 to J^-inch to
the foot on each side.
Diameter of Base.
A general rule for diamter of base, more or less closely followed for
years in England and the United States, is that the diameter of the base
should be one-tenth of the height.
Messrs. Bancroft quote the Metropolitan Board of Works regulations
which say:
"Width externally of a furnace chimney shaft at base shall be:
If square on plan, at least one-tenth of the total height of the shaft.
If octagonal on plan, at least one-eleventh of the total height.
If circular on plan, at least one-twelfth of the total height."
Condition for Minimum Material
If there are certain proportions of a chimney shaft of specified power,
that will give a minimum amount of material on construction, or it it
makes no difference what the dimensions are, it is equally desirable to
know the truth of the matter.
A decrease in height not only causes a decrease in weight on its own
account, but by decreasing the wind area causes a further decrease in the
weight necessary to balance the wind moment. The increase of internal
diameter is very small, compared to the decrease in height. Therefore
the external diameter need be increased but very little, increasing the
wind area much less than the height decreases it.
The thickness may also be reduced. The only two causes influencing
for increased weight, namely—increased diameter and consequent sectional
area and wind area, are more than offset by decrease in height and increase
in internal diameter and consequent direct reduction of thickness wind atea
and volume.
The problem of design consists then in deciding upon a chimney of
minimum height that will give the requisite capacity. If the chimney is
small a uniform batter may be assumed which will bring the diameter of
the base equal to about one-tenth the height. If the chimney is
large, a suitable variable batter may be adopted, which will give the same
ratio of base to height. It then remains to divide the shaft into a series
of divisions of uniform thickness increasing by half a brick, from one brick
at the top to as many as necessary at the base, so spacing the stages that
pi will be within the required limits and that equation (B) will be satisfied.


Graphical Method.
The ordinary, graphical method consists simply in plotting the total
force of the wind, on the effective area, horizontally, and the total weight
vertcally through the center of wind pressure of the given section and draw-
ing the resultant. If this resultant intersects the diameter of the base of
the section well within the limit, q=l/4D, the chimney may be considered
safe, provided pi is within the required limits.
This method is accurate and quick although its results are less tangible
than those of the analytical method. The centers of wind pressure of a
chimney with variable batter may often be determined graphically with the
greatest ease. ,


A PHYSICAL THEORY OF DYNAMO-ELECTRIC
MACHINES.
THESIS SUHMITTED FOR THE DEGREE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEER.
BY JOHN C. PARKER, B. S. ('Ol), A. H. ('02).
(Concluded from the February Technlc)
CAP. III.
Passing now to the case of the alternator, we find the same general
laws applicable. It will be more convenient in our consideration of this
machine to make certain special assumptions, as in the case of the com-
mutating machine. We shall again discuss the case of the bi-polar, uni-
form-field machine, and shall assume that the winding consists of a coil
of rectangular form lying in a plane; that is, of negligible thickness.
Calling the angle between the axis of the coil and the direction of the
flux 9, the length of the coil 1, and the distance from the axis of rotation
to the N conductors r, with field flux ♦ at density B, we see that each
turn of the winding includes a flux *. = 2 rl cos* B = ♦ cos*, and there-
fore the electromotive force induced when the coil turns with anguIaT
—N d +N
velocity *&gt; = — ♦ cosff = * sin* w, having as its maximum
2 dt 2
-(-N/2 ♦ o&gt;.
We see the same thing expressed otherwise when we note that the
velocity of a conductor across the field is -f~ *»r' where r' = r sinff is the
instantaneous radius for motion across the field; i. e., the perpendicular
from the center upon a line through the conductor, and normal to the
&lt;p
field. Hence, E. M. F. = —rNIB = Nr sin 9 a 1 B = N — w sin*: the
2
same result would be noted if we considered that the velocity of the con-
ductor r« makes an angle 8 with the flux, and hence that its transverse
component is ro&gt; sin 9 and E. M. F. = N r sin 9u\B, as before.
If this electromotive force be closed on a circuit of given resistance,
so that at any instant a current flows equal to E/R, we have a current
I sin 9, when the coil is in the position defined by the angle 9, where I is
the maximum current. Each of the N conductors is acted upon by a
force —I. B 1 opposing the motion, and this force, acting with a lever
arm r sin 9, gives a torque —r sin 9 I, BIN to the coil, or Tt = —Nlr
&lt;p
sin'fllm.iB = —NI — sin* 9. The torque is, then, at its maximum
2


—NI —, and is a sine function of the second degree, having only negative
2
values; i. e., opposing the motion. If from the value of maximum volts
E2
we derive the angular velocity, we have « = , and hence the power
N+
P. = «T. = —EI sin**, where the sign indicates that power is put into
the machine in the mechanical form, and drawn out electrically. The
average power P = —EI/2, since sin1* has lA as its average valua
Hereafter E and I will be understood as meaning the effective or square
root of mean square values which are to the maxima as 1 to V2. With
this substitution, we have
E =
2V2
—NI*
T. = sin'*; I = E/R;
V2
2EV2 —NI*
N* V2
P. = —IE' sin'*; P (aver) — —IE.
If now the circuit be closed upon a coil having self-inductance; that
is, so wound as to be capable of producing a magnetic field in the sur-
rounding medium, and threading the windings of the coil, the E. M. F.
will cause a current to flow, inducing a magnetic flux the change of which
induces in the coil an E. M. F., equal and opposite to that applied if
resistance be negligible, or otherwise less than that applied by the amount
of IR drop. Were this not so, the unbalanced E. M. F. would produce
a current indefinitely great with a correspondingly great flux and induced
E. M. F., which is impossible. We may then say that since the E M.
F. of self-induction is —L dl/dt, that applied equals L dl/dt, and hence,
E sin «t = L dl/dt, or integrating,

a double frequency quantity showing that, at the first, the energy, stored
in the magnetic field of the coil tends to turn the alternator; but that in
the next quarter period it opposes the motion with a resultant average
torque of zero. If now we connect a resistance and an inductance in
multiple, the current at any instant is the sum of the two separate ones,
as also the torque due thereto is the sum of the separate torque s.

Since I» = Irm«»sin*—Ixmncos*, we may write Irm.x and I.m.x as a

have I. = A (cos &lt;t&gt; sin* — sin &lt;t&gt; cos*) = A sin (*—0),
Ixmax
where 0=tan_1 , andV(Fxra««+I5riiiix)=A. From this we see that when
Irroax
the current in the coil is at its maximum, the field and the coil must have
already suffered an angular displacement of &lt;t&gt;. There will be then at w/a
from the coil axis a flux ♦ cos *, and in the same direction with it a flux
♦ sin &lt;P; the first of these combines with the alternating current of the
machine to give an effective torque as above, the second being subject to
no displacement from the coil axis at its maximum gives zero resulting
torque, as above. &lt;t&gt; is said to be then the power factor angle, and is de-
fined, as in the case of the direct current machine, either as the angular
lag of the wave of current behind the impressed electro-motive force, or
as the angle by which the field flux is displaced from the plane of the
coil when the current in the latter is at its maximum; in this latter case,
we see that the component of the flux giving an effective torque is to the
whole as cos &lt;t&gt; to unity, or, otherwise, that the maximum torque—radius
of the coil in the plane of the flux is r cos &lt;t&gt;. Similarly, a like effect, with
proper attention to signs, can be proved for the case in which the circuit
is closed on a condenser, or its equivalent.
As with the direct current machine, so here, the M. M. F. of the
armature has at any instant two components, one in the direction of the
field tending to magnetize or demagnetize, the other at right angles there-
to, producing a cross-magnetizing effect, either with or counter to the ro-
tation. This M. M. F. is, at its maximum, N/2lm«x4ir, at the time corres-
ponding to the highest current, and is directed normal to the plane of the
coil. At any instant later than this by time t, the coil will have rotated
through an angle *=wt, and will have a component M. M. F. in the direc-
tion of the maximum equal to the whole M. M. F. at the time of t, multi-
plied by cos wt. At the same time the current is Im.x cos wt, and so the


M. M. F. along the line of the maximum is N/alm.i^cos'wt, giving an
average, substituting effective I for Im««.

In case the current is wattless and lagging, this maxiumm axis coincides
with the field axis, and the armature turns tend to demagnetize the fields;
in case the circuit is non-inductive, the effect is to distort the field in
NI
the direction of rotation; if the current has a lag of &lt;t&gt;, of the ampere
2V2
turns, sin &lt;t&gt; are demagnetizing, and cos &lt;t&gt; are cross-magnetizing.
A study of this armature M. M. F. from a somewhat different point
of view may not be uninteresting. Since the armature current is at any
instant t equal to Ima»sin(«t—0), where t is reckoned from the instant
when the axis of the coil and of the field were in coincidence, we have
along the field axis a M. M. F. due to ampere turns whose number is
expressed by

= N/2lm«» ( sin 2 «t — sin* cos***).

Here the second term with its negative sign indicates the demagnetizing
effect as before; the average of the first term is seen to be zero, but it
has an effect which is worthy of note. It will be noted that this term is
positive for small values of "t, thus tending to increase the flux thread-
ing a coil, just as the rotation of the coil tends to decrease the same, thus
reducing the rate of change below what it would have been; in other
words, reducing the E. M. F. at the beginning of the half-wave, and at
the end of the half-wave similarly. When the half-wave of E. M. F. is
approaching its maximum, due to the rapid rate of diminution of the
flux threading the coil in this position, this armature magnetizing effect
is seen to rapidly approach zero, thus giving additional decrement to the
flux threading the coil and, hence, elevating the crest of the wave of E.
M. F. In this way a peaked wave of E. M. F. is formed, the resultant of
a fundamental and of a triple harmonic
Similarly we have cross-magneto-motive force due to ampere turns
given by

the first term of which has already been considered as indicating the


cross-magnetizing effect in the direction of rotation. The effect of the
term is 2&lt;»t will be as before to introduce a third harmonic in the wave of
E. M. F. By trigonometry we have the term sin'wt whose average we
have noted as equal to Vi reduced to Vi (I—cos«t), giving a constant—
the average—plus a double harmonic, whose effect has been noted. Sim-
ilarly,
cos*«t=H (i+sin2wt).
[Mr. Steinmetz called to my attention the following: If the field of
an alternator has superposed upon it its constant flux, a flux alternating
at n times the frequency of rotation of the machine, we may substitute
for the alternating component two constant fluxes of one-half the intens-
ity of the amplitude of these oscillations, both fluxes revolving at n times
the velocity of the machine, one in the same direction, the other in a
direction opposite to that of the machine, the two coinciding in direction
with the field flux when this is at its maximum. The armature rotates
relatively to these fluxes with a speed of n ± I times its actual speed, this
generating overtones of E. M. F. of magnitude n ± I. In our case n = 2,

As the space surrounding the armature coils can never have an in-
finite magnetic reluctance, there is set up in this space by the armature
current a magnetic flux proportional to the ampere turns of the armature,
the proportionality factor being \* over the magnetic reluctance of this
"leakage flux" path. The flux so set up is alternating, with the frequency
of the current, and may be considered as resolved into two factors, as
explained in the note above. So far as the voltage induction in the arm-
ature is concerned, these may be thought of as both coinciding and ro-
tating in the same direction, counter to the rotation of the armature, and
therefore as standing still in space. As the armature revolves, its con-
ductors cut this flux and there is induced in them an E. M. F. whose
maximum
'/iN/+W=Em..
occurs when the coil is in the plane at right angles to that occupied by it
at the instant of maximum current. But

This electro-motive force is seen to lag a quarter cycle behind the current,
as was the case in the direct current machine.
If, now, on the same armature we mount a coil at go deg. to the first
one and identical with it, the latter will have set up in it an electro-mo-
tive force differing from that in the first coil only in that it passes


through its various values at instants differing from the time of the same
events in the first coil by the time required for a quarter revolution; i. *.,
by a quarter period.
As we saw in the case of the machine with but one winding, if the
circuit is non-inductive, the current will be at its maximum when the coil
is in the plane of the flux, and drops off to zero when the coil has passed
through 90 deg., following a sine law; but the rotative moment of this
current varies as the square of the current, since the distance from the
center of rotation to the line of the force impelling the conductor is pro-
portional to the current. This gives us a wave of torque having its max-
ima when the conductors are under the poles, its zero values when they
lie half way between the poles, and this wave is a pure sine wave. If
now we substitute for the function sin'x its equivalent lA(i—cos2x);
i. e., note that the torque is composed of a steady torque equal to one-half
the maximum ,plus a simple harmonic torque of amplitude equal to half
the maximum and of twice the frequency of rotation; we see readily that
the alternator of two windings-two—or quarter-phase—will have a steady
torque equal to the maximum produced by one coil alone, or to twice its
steady torque. The alternating double frequency torque of the one coil
is obviously of the same magnitude and of opposite sign to that in the
other coil, thus eliminating the periodic fluctuations of torque; this is
seen to be the case, since, when one coil is in the plane of the field and
has its maximum torque, the other is at right angles thereto and has zero
torque; that is, the two coils are undergoing their mean torque ± the am-
plitude of the alternating torque, a rotation of 45 deg. brings the alter-
nating torque to zero in both coils, a rotation of 6 deg. from this position
makes it proportional to sin 2f&gt; in one coil, to —sin 28 in the other. If
now we consider the case of the armature closed on an inductive circuit,
we see that the current in any conductor is zero when it is opposite the
center of a pole face, and hence has its maximum lever arm; the current
is proportional to the sine of the angular displacement of the coil, the
lever arm of the force producing rotation is proportional to the cosine,
and hence is zero when the current is a maximum, thus giving a double
frequency torque; in the first quarter-revolution opposing the rotation,
in the next adding to it by the same amount, thus representing a double
frequency torque of alternating character. If under these conditions an
alternator coil is undergoing a given positive torque, obviously a coil at 90
degrees thereto would be undergoing an equal negative torque, and in
consequence there will be on the machine no mechanical torque or load.
A slightly more involved proof extended to machines of more than two
phases shows that in a poly-phase machine the torque, and hence the load,
&gt;s constant throughout the cycle.
Returning now to the two-phase machine, and noting that all deduc-


tions for it apply—with suitable constants—to machines of many phases;
we sec that as the currents rise, fall and reverse in the different armature
coils, a M. M. F. is set up which has a fixed direction with respect to the
field of the machine: i. e., rotates backward at synchronous speed with
respect to the armature. This M. M. F. obviously will in the two-phase
machine, lie along the axis of the coil of the armature when the current
in that coil is at its maximum, and is V2N/2I, since its value is depen-
dent upon the current in one coil alone, that in the other being zero at
the instant under consideration. Let now the armature rotate through
an angle #, the current in the first coil dropping to lV2cos#, that in the
second becoming —IV2sin*, giving a resultant M. M. F. the same as be-
fore, but rotated backward with respect to the armature by the angle 8;
that is, in the same position with respect to the field. Since E. M. F. in
a coil is at its maximum when that coil is in the plane of the field flux,
if the current passes through its cycle in phase with the E. M. F., the M.
M. F. of the armature will always be directed at right angles to the field
flux, and the torque on the machine will be the product of the two mag-
net strengths, that of the armature, and that of the field, with a suitable
constant factor involving the number of armature conductors, the arma-
ture dimensions, etc., exactly as in the case of commutating machines.
If, however, the current lags &lt;t&gt; degrees behind the E. M. F., we have
the armature rotating through the angle &lt;t&gt; beyond the position of max-
imum E. M. F. in any coil before the current in that coil reaches its max-
imum; that is, the angle between the constant M. M. F. of the armature
and the line of the field flux is less than */2 by &lt;t&gt;. In this case, taking
either the armature M. M. F. or the field flux as the datum, it is seen
that, of the other, one component—the absolute value times the sin &lt;t&gt;—is
in the line of the datum; that is, can cause no torque, while the cos &lt;P
component is at right angles to the other field; i. e., produces torque; this
cos 0 is the power factor. We note also that the armature M. M. F.
component in the direction of the field is proportional to the current,
turns, and sin &lt;t&gt; of the armature, tending to magnetize if current leads,
to demagnetize if it lags in the generator. If current is reversed, the
torque is reversed; i. e., is in the direction of rotation, and the machine
is a motor, the reversal of M. M .F. in the armature giving an armature
reaction which magnetizes with lagging currents, demagnetizes with lead-
ing. It is further seen that the armature M. M. F. sets up in space about
the armature a stray field which is 90 deg. in space behind the axis of
field flux if current and E.M.F. are in phase, and as much further back than
this as the current lags behind the E.M.F. if they are not in phase. The
conductors cutting this flux generate an E. M. F. which lags behind the
current 90 deg. in phase. This stray flux is 4«-N/2lV2/R and since E.


N-I&gt;w 4"-N*
M. F. is , we have E«= I&lt;", but the factor 4*/R(N/2)' is the
2V2 R4
coefficient of self-inductance L of the coil of N/2 turns, so we have
Ei=«&gt;LI. We see, then, that all the formulae for the induction of E. M.
F., for current, for power, power factor, armature reaction, armature re-
actance, torque, and speed are the same for both altenators and com-
mutating machines, and that the phenomena involved are due to entirely
the same causes.
Referring now to the eddy current losses, we note that in any cross-
section of the metal by a plane through the axis of rotation, E. M. F. will
be set up which will cause a current flow in a closed circuit in this section,
and in any plane of section behind this by *, a current flow lagging in
phase by 9 is occurring; when the disc has rotated through the angle *;
i. e., when the second plane of section is in the position previously occu-
pied by the first, the current in it will be in the same phase as that in
the first section had before the rotation through the angle • had beeta
made. In other words, the eddy currents in the disc are constant in any
plane fixed with reference to the field, and so exert a steady dragging
torque. The eddy currents circuits constitute infinite alternator arma-
tures, each of an infinitude of phases working synchronously, each little
armature being enclosed inside another and separate therefrom, except
as influenced by mutual inductance. All the previous laws apply to these
small circuits.
In conclusion we will note certain features of the induction motor
in the light of what has preceded, showing that the induction motor and
generator arc essentially identical with the synchronous motor and
generator, which are in their turn specialized, by a switching device for
inter-corinecting the phases of a many-phased alternator, into the com-
mutating machine. Since, then, the so-called "static" transformer and
alternatirrg-commutating machines are but special types of induction
machines, we will hope to have a general theory, explaining the operation
of all types of electrical machines.
CAP. IV.
In the discussion of the features of the induction machine here noted,
we will make the same assumptions as before, and discuss the problem
for the case of a two-phase, concentrated, winding motor. As the more
exact calculation of the induction motor has been so beautiful!}
worked out in the complex quantity by Mr. Steinmetz, and graphically
by Mr. Behrend, and in view of the volume of material on this machinery
a vast horde of others, we will here enter into discussion of only those
features of the machine which are of most interest from our view-point.


In the transformer, the M. M. F. of primary and secondary must be very
nearly equal and opposite in direction, whether the two parts are station-
ary with respect to each other or not, and as the E. M .F.'s are induced
in each by a common flux, varying in the induction motor with fre-
quency impressed in the stator and with the slip frequency in the roto-
we have
NT = NT
nN'* (u—w^N"*
E' = , E" =
2V2 2V2
I'E' &lt;•&gt;
I"E" w—&lt;»'
Here, obviously, for ordinary power factors of the primary, the volt-
amperes, and hence the power, in the secondary is very much less tihan
than that delivered to the primary. This loss of electrical power, we
are told, is the mechanical output of the motor. Again, it is said that the
I'R or electrical power in the rotor is to the total power input as the
frequences concerned; i. e., as the slip to the impressed frequency, and
the mechanical power enters in the ratio represented by the rotation
velocity—this in a rough, general way. Taking up the latter statement
first :—
By the rotation of the field ♦, an E .M. F. is set up in the windings
of the rotor, and this sets up a current of lagging character, which in
its turn sets up a M. M. F. somewhat more than 90 deg. indirection
behind the flux *. As we have seen ,the component of the flux * which
is at 90 deg. with the axis of rotor M. M. F., and therefore capable
of producing torque, is represented by the volts necessary to overcome the
resistance, and is given as
*N («—«') 2V2 IR
IR = , or *t
2V2 N(w—«')
and this with the current I gives for a loss of power of I'R per phase
a torque
NI* 2FR
T = .
2 (a—w')
Then we may say that in the I'R losses we have a current I and a volt-
age E induced by a component of the ♦ at right angles to the axis of
M. M. F. of I, and hence producing torque, or the E. M. F., E, is set
up by a flux *, and that of the total current flowing in consequence the
part in phase with E gives a M. M. F. normal to ♦.
Since the torque on the rotor by field ♦ is T, the mechanical power is
obviously the torque times the angular velocity &lt;•&gt;', or


2l'R«'
P' = *&gt;'T = — —, or if PR is total loss, as far other
than two-phase rotors,
F = PR
Now, obviously, total power input is the sum of the outputs, or
a
P = PR + P' = PR - - , or we have
P P' PR
The value of P might be deduced as being equal to wT, since the flux ♦,
exerting a strain T, rotates at a speed *&gt;, or
PR
P = «T = «
Looking at this matter somewhat otherwise, we note that when the
induction motor is at rest, the flux ♦, set up by the stator, M. M. F.
induces in the rotor an E. M. F.
♦Nw
E = ,
2V2
in consequence of which a rotor current flows of value I, and lagging
behind E by an angle &lt;t&gt;, such that
I = &lt;J&gt;N«
E =
VtR'+CwLP] 2V2 V[R*+(«L)']
«L
tan &lt;P =
R
The E. M. F. is at its maximum in a given coil when the plane of that
coil is coincident with the flux ♦, whereas the current in that coil reaches
its maximum at a later by the difference in phase of the current and E.
M. F. (reduced to time), by which time the flux has swung around by
the angle &lt;t&gt;, so that of ♦ only the component ♦ cos &lt;P can produce a torque
(similarly to the case of the alternator). We will have, then, a torque
set up of constant value, and dependent upon I * cos &lt;t&gt;, defined by the
equation
NI+ N'-PwR
T = cos &lt;t&gt; =
V2 4(R'+«V)
or with the substitution of
N + « = 2V2 VfR'+wV) I


2l'R
, as above.
We note here that torque is proportional to the square of the flux, or,
what is the same thing, of the primary counter E. M. F., as a conse-
quence of the fact that the torque is due to the product of induced currents
by flux, where the induced currents are themselves proportional to flux.
In general, the winding space of the motor is a fixed quantity, so that
the cross section of single wire—insulation aside—is inversely proportional
to the length; that is to say, the resistance, as well as the inductance,
will vary as the square of the number of turns, so that the rotor angle
of lag is independent of the number of winding turns. Induced E. M. F.
is proportional to the turns, so that rotor currents are in inverse ratio
to the number of turns and ampere turns, and hence torque is independent
of the factor N. Obviously, ohmic losses are also constant, if the total
cross section of winding space is fixed. As to the relation of R to «L,
it is to be noted that for good design L it made as low as possible and
to is fixed; therefore the denominator of the fraction
N'+'wR
T = ,
4(R'+«,L')
cannot be reduced and torque increased by varying this factor. If R
is of small value, it may be increased without any great effect on the
demominator of the fraction, but directly varying the numerator, and hence
the torque. Physically we state this as follows:—If the resistance of
the rotor of an induction motor is low and inductance high, the flux
and rotor M. M. F. are nearly go degrees apart, a slight increase of the
resistance does not materially affect the absolute value of the current,
but serves to bring it decidedly forward in phase. When the resistance
and reactance are equal, the decrease in current just balances any in-
crease in the power factor. Beyond this point, resistance is the predomi-
nant factor in the rotor impedance, while power factor tends to constancy,
giving lower torques for larger values of R. This could have been
derived by making
dT N'+VL, N*** = o, whence R = wL,. This gives Tun = =
dR 42"'L' 8L
If, now, the motor has a speed of rotation &lt;■&gt;', the frequency with
which the flux ♦ cuts the rotor conductors is w—w', the frequency of slip,
and the E. M. F. induced will therefore have the value
&lt;J&gt;N(«—&lt;•&gt;')
2V2
a value less than that at standstill in the ratio of the frequencies. The


current will be that due to this smaller E. M. F. divided by the imped-
ance, now V[R*+L'(«—«')']. and will lag behind the E. M. F. by the
phase angle
(u»-&lt;-')L
&lt;t&gt; = tan—1
R
Before the current in any given coil can attain its maximum, the flux +
will have swung forward by the angle &lt;t&gt; from the plane of the coil. This
angle will, of course, be smaller than in the previous case, on account
of the fact that while the current is risng to its maximum value, the
coil is being carried forward by the rotation of the rotor &lt;■&gt;'. As above
we have
«t&gt;N(a&gt;—«')
E =
I =
2V2
E "tNCw—&amp;&gt;')
tan &lt;t&gt;
T =

R
NI* cos &lt;P N'+'Cw—«')R 2rR
V2 4[R'+(&lt;»—„')'L']
dT/dR = o gives R = (&lt;*—«')L.
Here again the effect of rotor resistance is to keep the current from
reaching its maximum value too far back of the rotating field. Since
the first results were obtained for any velocity of rotation of the rotating
magnet field, and since the maximum torque was independent of &lt;•&gt;, we
might have looked for these results. We note here the importance of
keeping L low, in that it gives greater torque for the machine. If now
we plot curves of torque as a function of slip, we shall see that fpr
small slips the term in L ("—«&gt;') is small of the second degree, giving
T =
4R'
that is, torque is proportional to the slip. The part of the curve near
synchronism will be approximately a straight line more and more near
the vertical, as R is made smaller, and giving torque T = 0/0, only at
synchronism if the resistance is quite zero. This means that near syn-
chronism the currents induced are in phase with the E. M. F., and propor-
tional to the slip, and hence torque is proportional to slip.
At and near stand still, if R is small, it is negligible in comparison with
wl_, and we have E .M. F. and impedance both proportional to the slip,


and hence current is constant. The cosine of the angular displacement
behind flux is the resistance divided by the impedance, the former being
constant, the latter practically proportional to the slip, so that torque
is inversely proportional to slip. This part of the curve, then, is a
a rectangular hyperbolic arc assymptotic to zero torque—zero slip. As
the crest of the curve is fixed by Turn, this indicates the limits within
which our curve must lie. For these low speeds
T = .
(w—w')l/4
If here R = o ,the hyperbolic arc becomes the two right lines u'—w' m o
and T = o, which, with our other right line u—a' = o gives the limiting
case of synchronism as the only speed at which the motor will operate.
In this case, we have rotor resistance zero, and current at synchronism
indeterminate. If, however, we note that
&lt;I&gt;N (&lt;*—«') *N
2V2L(«—w') 2V2L
we have the value of I which we note is of zero frequency. The rotor
(w—«')L
power factor angle similarity is &lt;t&gt; — tar-'- = o/o, always
R
at synchronism; that is to say, &lt;P may have any value giving any torque
up to T«». Returning now to the value of I, we note that on substitut-
4ttN8

I = or ♦ =
2V2TN V2 R
Since we have here +m«i, we note that Iron — V2I, or
4»NIro.«

wherefore the current in the rotor under these conditions is such as will
support the flux +, and is direct current. In actual practice, this condition
of zero resistance is represented by the case when sufficient E. M. F. is
supplied from without to neutralize the resistance drop, and the machine
then becomes a synchronous motor. One coil may be always the active
coil, the other rotor winding being dispensed with. The angle &lt;t&gt; will
be determined by the value of the field and armature flux, and will be
of just such dimensions as to give
T = p ♦ +' cos &lt;P,
as in Cap. III.
It is somewhat interesting to note that we have here, as in the case


of the direct current machine a hysteretic torque exerted on the rotor
by the rotating magnet flux, and that this supplies part of the mechanical
power output of the motor.

This hysteresis motor effect is due, then, simply to the fact that as the
rotating magnetic field passes by any point of the rotor, the induced mag-
netization does not drop so fast as it rose, thus causing the effective polar-
ity of the rotor to lag behind that of the stator, producing torque. As
this effect is independent of slip, such a hysteresis motor is a synchronous
machine.
The application of the foregoing method to single-phase machines,
series-alternating repulsion, reaction, and other machines, mighjt be
extended almost indefinitely, but it is thought not desirable at this time
to further illustrate the method.

MICHIGAN UNION CLUB HOUSE.
The plans of the Michigan Union Club House shown herewith are
only sketches, suggestions of what such a building well might be. The
purpose in making them was to give some adequate idea of the amount of
space to be occupied, and what should be included in a building of this
character. In making these plans the design of other buildings of a sim-
ilar nature has been considered.
This building is intended primarily as a home for the student in his
leisure hours. As designed it will consist of a main portion three stories

TniRp Floor PLah
high, 136 x 60 feet, with a wing 40 x 120 feet at either end of the main
portion. On the ground floor are the living apartments. The doors
of the main entrance open directly to the main staircase. On either side,
as one enters, are the offices of the Union and of the alumni association.
From the main lobby, halls lead either way to the wings. On one side

is the living room, while the other is taken up with the dining room and
restaurant. The living room will be the largest and most attractive room
in the building, 40x118 feet, extending to the top of the second floor,
and will have adjoining a parlor 30 x 37 feet, and a library of the same
size. In the other wing besides the ordinary dining room which will
include a cafe and lunch counter, there will be a training table for the
athletic teams. On the ground floor there will also be suitable offices for
athletic association and three club rooms. A smaller entrance at one
side is provided as a ladies' entrance which leads directly to the ladies'
lobby on the floor above.
By referring to the plan of the second floor, it will be seen that the
living room is provided with a gallery seven feet wide extending around
three sides of the room. It would be possible, on occasion, to utilize
the living room, parlor, library and gallery of the living room as an assem-
bly hall which would seat about 600 people.
The main portion of the second floor is to be devoted mainly to club
rooms, smoking and game rooms, and offices for college publications.
In one wing is a ladies' room and two banquet halls, for the giving of
club banquets such as are held by the Schoolmasters' Club and the
Quadrangle. The wings are carried up only two stories thus giving light
on all sides to third floor rooms which occupy the central portion of the
building. On this floor there are four small society rooms, a large
hall, seating about 175 people and two smaller society halls or dormitories
each seating about 35 people. Besdes these rooms there are six bed
chambers with bath rooms attached, to be used by visiting alumni and
men of prominence who come to visit the university. It is the intention
to use the club rooms as dormitories so that when the hotels of the city
are overtaxed they can be used as sleeping rooms by visiting alumni.
In the basement of the building there are to be five bowling alleys,
thirteen pool and billiard tables and a game room. The balance of the
basement is to be occupied by servants' quarters, kitchen, store rooms
and boiler room.
The estimated cost of this building as shown in the plans would be
about $70,000 without furnishings. The approximate cubic contents are
320,000 feet.
The plans are the suggestion of Professor John R. Allen, who has
carefully studied the club house question and the arrangement of other
similar buildings. The work on the drawings reproduced here was per-
formed by Professor Allen, assisted by A. M. Graver.


EDITORIALS.
We take pleasure in presenting the second issue for 1905 to our
readers. With its appearance, we announce that the venture to a semi-
annual publication has been a gratifying success in every way and the
Board desires to extend its sincere thanks to every one who has helped
to make it such.
Among these are the loyal Michigan men who have entered heartily
into our plans by becoming subcribers to the Michigan Technic and asso-
ciate members of the Society. It has been gratifying, indeed, to receive
so many letters of good will and encouragement from the alumni in every
part of the country, and with such a spirit manifest there is no reason
why, in the near future, the Michigan Technic shall not become a techni-
cal journal of which the department and her graduates may well be
proud.
We wish to acknowledge the generous service of Mr. W. A. Living-
stone ,of Detroit, in furnishing data for the biography of Prof. Williams.
We had hoped to present in this number an article on Problems in the
Design of High Buildings, by Miss Marian S. Parker, our only alumna,
of Purdy and Henderson, New York, but lack of time prevented its
preparation.
The Fittings and Work of the Experimental Naval Tank, by Profes-
sor H. C. Sadler, will also be ready for the next issue.
Stability of Chimneys, by R. C. Stevens, which appears in this number,
is only a part of this thesis. Another portion, the Capacity of Chimneys,
will probably appear later.
On the evening of Friday, March 14, 1005, occurred the first reception
tendered the Faculty of the Engineering Department by the Engineering


o
-a


Society. It held an added intererst in the nature of a "house warming"
for the new Society Room. Both the Society Room and the newly com-
pleted Library were thrown open, and, when decorated with palms and
roses and fully lighted .presented a pleasing appearance. Over fifty mem-
bers of the Faculty were present and the Society, as host, was represented
by about one hundred and thirty members. Refreshments were served
through the evening, and such an enjoyable time was experienced that it
was far into the evening when the last guest departed.
One great need which this has supplied is a means of bringing stu-
dents and instructors together outside the class room, where they may
mingle as fellows, a want that had been strongly felt since the Department
grew to such large proportions. Another purpose which the reception
served is in bringing the students themselves to know one another. The
society is so large that it is only on occasions of this nature that one
meets many of his fellow members, and the annual banquet has been
found to be effectual only to a small degree, coming as it does but once
a year and near its close.
As supplying both these wants, the reception has been proven a suc-
cess, and it is to be hoped it may continue as an annual or a semi-annual
function.
We are proud to claim as one of our graduates in engineering, a
woman who has achieved remarkable success in her chosen profession,
our only alumna, Miss Marian S. Parker. She graduated in 1895 with
the degree of B. S. in Civil Engineering.
She entered Michigan from the Detroit high school, coming with
the determination of being a civil engineer. It was an unusual course
for a woman to pursue, but Miss Parker distinguished herself, and her
unusual choice was followed by unusual and very remarkable success.
She is in the office of a firm of consulting engineers in New York
City, and in the metropolis are many monuments to her mechanical
skill, among them some of its famous sky-scrapers.
In the five years that she has been working on these plans she has
designed buildings costing $10,000,000. She is the designer of every
inch of the structural steel work from foundation to roof, of the Broad
Exchange, the biggest office building in New York. She has designed
the structural steel work, including the foundation, of the great White-
hall building on Battery place, the twenty-story structure known generally
as "42 Broadway," the Barclay building, Broadway and Duane street,
and the Bank of the Metropolis. Miss Parker also worked on the
designs for the famous Fiat-Iron building, and was one of the deisgners


of the Tribune building of New York. At present she is at work on the
designs for the Engineering Societies' building in New York City, the
gift of Mr. Carnegie, to the American Societies.
Miss Parker has unquestionably demonstrated her ability as an en-
gineer, and in the light of her remarkable success it is to be wondered
at that so very few women have followed engineering rather than the
other professions, in which they are so well represented.
During the Easter recess, the annual trip of mechanical and electrical
students through the eastern manufacturing establishments was made,
and a party of thirty-one including Assistant Professors Anderson and
Hazelton and Mr. Bursley took advantage of this opportunity to obtain
a view of the practical side of engineering. Toledo, Pittsburg, Philadel-
phia, New York and Buffalo were included in the itinerary, and the prin-
cipal engineering works at these places and their suburbs were visited
under the guidance of alumni who were always in evidence. A day of
sight-seing was followed by a banquet, where the boys were toasted by
enthusiastic alumni who everywhere assembled to give the boys from
Michigan a good time. On their return home, though tired and worn,
everyone had breath enough left to sing the praise of Michigan men they
had met and were enthusiastic over the enginering wonders they had
witnessed and upon their royal entertainment.
The value of these trips as an educational means cannot be over-
estimated and every engineering student who is able should avail himself
of the opportunity to observe engineering in practical operation.
We remark elsewhere in this number upon the increase in attendance
in the technical schools, and in connection with this topic we might men-
tion the receipt of advance sheets from the Electric Club Journal for May
containing a talk by Mr. W. C. Kerr on Various Kinds of Education.
As therein treated, the present popularity of technical education is
arrived at through a gradual change in the character of a college curri-
culum since the time when "an educated man was perforce a classical
man", to the present when one is left to freely choose what is best adapted
to his needs.
This change has come about,—partly in opposition to educators, who
mainly argued the classic education,—through the requirements of the
practical world, which as time passed began to murmur that college edu-
cation was a failure.
The result is that today there are as many types of education as there
are types of men, and this freedom together with the realization that
"the world wants men who can do things" has led most men to take up
a preparation to meet the practical side of life.
